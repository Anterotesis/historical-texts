            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Aire ſex, to whom Nature hath given what ſhe had
moſt rich and lovely, ſpring of moſt agreeable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
that hold in your faire hands the Empire of
the Univerſe, ſince you command over men, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute
to them at your pleaſures, either good or bad
fortune; 'tis to you alone I preſent this worke; I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
it to the moſt delicate objects of the earth; and as you are that
which moſt pleaſes in the world, ſo is it you alſo I deſire moſt to pleaſe. If
the very power of love depends not but on yours, whatſoever appertaines
to it, owes no homage but to you; and theſe adventures that are effects of
Ladies beautie, are not to be offered but to thoſe that may produce the
like. I hope there is not one amongst you that will not finde here how
to paſſe away ſome houres with pleaſure. The ſevereſt will not be
offended that this booke ſpeakes to them of love, and will not feare, as
they read it, to tell themſelves that they would be loth to heare from the
mouthes of men. Thoſe that ſuffer onely to be loved without loving, and
will have much reſpect and ceremony, ſhall here find ſuch Lovers as they
deſire: And thoſe that are ſofter, and who to eaſe the flames of their
ſervants are willing to take a part of them, ſhall have ſome ſatisfaction
to ſee their owne paſſions here authoriz'd by examples. But becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
thoſe that love, there are ſome conſtant, and ſome wanderers,
and this booke altogether takes part with the firſt, I ſhould feare leſt
the other ſide might not take offence to ſee their humour ill intreated, if
I did not give them reaſons to defend themſelves againſt thoſe that are
alleaged in this worke. The moſt ſevereſt Judges would finde it a hard
matter to reſolve which is more commendable, either to know how to keep
a paſſion in ſpight of fortunes traverſes, or to change it to good purpoſe.
It is indeed a very glorious thing to make an invincible love appeare, that
feares neither heaven nor earth, that is the ſtronger for very oppoſition,
and that would not be ſhaken by the ruine of the whole world. Such af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
as theſe cannot be ſo perfect, but that they are founded upon ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
and reaſon having bred them, they muſt of neceſſity laſt alwayes, it
being impoſſible that what was once reaſon, ſhould be ſo no more. There is
none but muſt confeſſe this kinde of loving admirable, but it is as rare
withall. The moſt part of loves grow of light cauſes, a little charme ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes
the eies, and takes from them the knowledge of many defects. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
<pb facs="tcp:7768:4"/>
in theſe affections in without doubt more vicious than change; and
very often they call inconſtancy, that which in effect is but a judicious
retrait. Change is ſometimes a vertue more ſtrong, and more couragious
than Conſtancie it ſelfe. 'Tis by it one tames a paſſion of many yeares, and
repaires all the diſorder that was in the ſoule. Men that have alwayes
more cauſe to love, fall leaſt into inconſtancy; and Ladies that find in us
ſo many defaults, do oftentimes by reaſon, &amp; by a generous ſtriving, that
they are thought to do but out of weakneſſe. The law that forbids change,
is only more rigorous for us: for it ſeemes we are oblig'd to ſuffer to the
very extremity, rather than be unfaithfull; and women are excuſable for
changing the leaſt unquietneſſe love gives them. Conſtancy is a quality
too ſerious, and too melancholike, for ſo agreeable and delightfull a ſex.
That which deſtroyes beauty, ought to be deteſted amongst you, as much
as old age or ſickneſſe. This ſame Conſtancy would appeare valiant in you,
and capable to ſupport vexations, at the charge of your richeſt treaſures.
'Tis ſhee that extinguiſhes that lively brightneſſe of the eyes, that effa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the colour, that ruines the good looke; and that to gaine you the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of loving well, makes you loſe the other of being loved. Lightneſſe
hath much more jollity and charmes; and if by ſome cruell accident in
love there muſt happen one of theſe two changes, either of the wit, or of the
beauty, you may very well be pardoned, if you choſe that which preſerves
the thing in the world you account deareſt. And theſe are the reaſons the
inconſtant may allege; they that follow the lawes of fidelity ſhall finde
enough in the book to anſwer them. I counſell every one of you to continue
in the opinion that is moſt conformable to her humour; and demand of you
this grace onely, that thoſe that are pleas'd to be unfaithfull, blame not
the auſtere fidelities they ſhall finde here deſcrib'd, and that thoſe that
love conſtancy, accuſe not the inconſtant. But I ſtay you, while peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
you are impatient to entertaine <hi>Ariana.</hi> I leave you then with her;
and yet before quitting of you, I muſt advertiſe you that ſhe is ſomthing
baſhfull, becauſe ſhe hath alwaies bin ſhut up, and never yet ſeene the
world; and that if you deſire her entertainment ſhould divert you, you
muſt not addreſſe you to her altogether, to learne her adventures. Shee
could not then tell which of you to ſatisfie, and in the tumult would loſe
many of her graces. Take her each of you apart into ſome retired place,
and then giving her attention and ſilence, ſhe wil freely recount to you all
her life, and tell the very leaſt of her thoughts. She cannot love noiſe, or
aſſemblies, ſince repoſe and ſolitude gave birth to her.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ome</hi> began to reſent with griefe the violences and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of <hi>Nero,</hi> after having ſuffered with patience the firſt
debauches of his youth: and the people that was proud
with the ſpoyles of all the world, groned under the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
of that Prince; when Fortune was pleas'd to bring
forth accidents to croſſe the moſt vertuous affections of
the earth, and ſuffer'd that the Cirque, where Combats
were made onely for pompe and recreation, ſhould bee
watered with blood by a deteſtable treaſon. But that baſeneſſe could not have
its full effect, and was not left unrevenged, for that by a proſperous fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
of heaven, thoſe who were appointed to aſſault, were prevented by a
terrour, which taking from them their courage and judgement, preſerv'd
the lives of thoſe that were ordain'd to deſtruction. Two young <hi>Sicilians</hi>
going by night through the City, one of them carried by love, the other out
of compla<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſance onely for his friend, and paſſing neere the Cirque with
foure or five of their traine, after they had made a noyſe with their ſwords
upon ſome deſigne they had, were ſet upon by a troope of men at Armes,
whoſe diſorder made them rather ſeeme perſons affrighted, than reſolute
for the lives of thoſe ſtrangers: Nevertheleſſe, their number was ſuch, that
had it not beene for the extreme valour they encountred, they would ſoone
have made themſelves free paſſage: But they that were aſſail'd, being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of their purpoſe, ſhewed ſuch dexterity and valour, that after a great
fight, the other party was conſtrain'd to ſay, It was the Emperour.</p>
               <p>At that name the ſtrangers gave the day over, when they had done a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
actions too brave to have had no other light but the Moones; and let
their enemies retire: But they remain'd ſo charg'd with wounds, that one of
them fell downe preſently in a ſowne for loſſe of blood, and the other going
to helpe his friend, was ſurpriz'd with a like faintneſſe.</p>
               <p>Their ſervants, who melted into teares to ſee their valiant Maſters in that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7768:5"/>
extremity, were preparing to lift them up from the place to carry them to
their houſes, when two Ladies richly clothed, and whoſe beauty received
a luſtre from the Torches that two young boyes carried before them, came
thither with their ſervants to learne the cauſe of the noyſe they had heard
before their lodging; but ſeeing thoſe that lay along upon the place, and
knowing them to be the brave <hi>Melintus,</hi> and the generous <hi>Palamedes;</hi> the
love <hi>Emilia</hi> had to <hi>Melintus</hi> put her into an extreme ſorrow to ſee him for
her occaſion in ſo deplorable an eſtate; and <hi>Camilla</hi> gave ſome teares to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamedes</hi>
misfortune, of whom ſhe knew ſhe was ſo paſſionately loved.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Siſters after they had a long time expreſſ'd their griefe, cauſed
the bodies to be carried home to their houſe, to make tryall of remedies
that might make them come to themſelves againe, and put them in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
places into beds becomming the richeſſe and luxuriouſneſſe of that age.</p>
               <p>And there <hi>Melintus</hi> by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Emilia</hi> returning as it were from
a profound ſleepe, and at laſt opening his eyes, asked where <hi>Palamede</hi> was.
<hi>Emilia</hi> that knew well their friendſhip, told him hee was not farre off, and
that he was hurt as well as himſelfe; but if it pleas'd the gods, they were both
in no great danger. Then he intreated <hi>Emilia</hi> that ſhe would let him goe ſee
him: But ſhe would in no wiſe ſuffer him, becauſe he might not yet riſe for
his wounds; and was ſatisfied in this to aſſure him that hee was in the next
Chamber in as great need of reſt as he. Leave me then, ſaid he, to my reſt, I
pray you; and not able to endure the ſight of her, he turn'd himſelfe to the
other ſide of the bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Emilia</hi> being gone, he beganne thus to complaine to himſelfe: Ah, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamed,</hi>
what faults doe I incurre by your friendſhip, againſt the pureneſſe of
my love! Was not my feining to love <hi>Emilia,</hi> at your requeſt, inſupportable
enough to me, but it muſt ſtill draw on more diſaſters! What couldſt thou
expect but vengeance from the gods, after thou hadſt ſo often betrayed my
ſoule, forcing my words to be contrary to all my thoughts? In ſtead of orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all that is in me by a common conſent to adore but one thing, I have
permitted a diviſion within my ſelfe, my mouth and actions ſacrificing to
falſe Deities, while my thoughts ador'd but one moſt pure and holy one. But
for all this could I deny <hi>Palamede</hi> any thing? or could my love refuſe to bee
forced thus for his ſake, that was Author of it? And when hee deſir'd my
helpe, ſhould I have alleag'd the ſeverity of our Lawes, to brand my ſelfe
with ingratitude? Alas! how hard is it to live exempt from blame; and how
oft for ſatisfying one duty, doe men quit the conſideration of another? At
leaſt thou my Soule wilt witneſſe for me, and thou Divinity that art preſent to
my remembrance, that if my words have given a reſpect to any other thing,
my thoughts have ſtill diſavow'd them, and deſpis'd ſuch ſubjects unworthy
of their conſideration, and farre differing from the perfect cauſe of my
affection.</p>
               <p>Hee ſtayd himſelfe ſome while upon that conceit that gave him comfort:
then ſeeing in how many places he was hurt, hee continued thus thinking:
Muſt the wounds of that true affection I labour under be inviſible, while for
a diſguis'd love, I beare ſo true and viſible hurts? hurts ſometimes marks of
glory, but to me ſhamefull; how ſhall I conceale you from my offended
love? Fortune that my conſtancy deſpis'd, hath not loſt the occaſion at what
<pb facs="tcp:7768:5"/>
time my actions might well be blam'd for infidelity: and after ſhee had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
on me by theſe wounds the eternall remembrance of that ſame encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in ſpight of my deſignes hath brought mee to theſe beds I ſo carefully
avoyded. But, Fortune doe what thou canſt, thou ſhalt never make my ſoule
conſent to loſe the quality of loving well. I am reveng'd of thee by deſpiſing
thy favours ſo deſired of others: one while thou preſentſt me them under the
charmes of ſweetneſſe and facilitie: another while thou lead'ſt me to them by
the force of thy inevitable accidents, for to ruine in mee a perfection that
ſcornes thy Empire: And I have nothing to oppoſe them with, but the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the beauty I love, for to render all their devices unprofitable. No,
no, deceiver, never hope to have mee forſake this conſtancy thou art enemy
to; thou mayſt well make my affection unfortunate, but thou ſhalt never be
able to make it decline ſo much as one degree from that height it hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</p>
               <p>Such different thoughts tormented or comforted his Spirit as it received
each kind of them, and entertain'd him till the next day, when hee found
himſelfe conſtrain'd to keepe his bed becauſe of his wounds, although there
was none of them mortall. But <hi>Palamede</hi> was a great while longer without
ſhewing any ſigne of life, but that his heart did yet beat: Nevertheleſſe, by
force of medicines they made his ſight returne at laſt, and his wounds being
ſearcht were found very dangerous.</p>
               <p>Theſe two friends had a great eſtimation at <hi>Rome</hi> for their Nobility ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with many admirable qualities, and acquir'd the friendſhip of all
that loved vertue, ſince their honeſt deſire to ſee the ſeat of the Empire had
caus'd them to follow an Embaſſie which the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> ſent to <hi>Nero,</hi> to be
eas'd of certaine new impoſitions. They had made themſelves recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
in that employment, and gain'd the glory to bee accounted the moſt
accompliſh'd men in the world, but yet by differing qualities; <hi>Melintus</hi> that
had a wiſe, and perfectly diſcreet ſpirit, was the more reſerv'd, and more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely
manifeſted his naturall vertues, and thoſe Sciences he had learned:
But <hi>Palamede</hi> was the prompter and more undertaking, yet with ſuch
grace, that for the moſt part his deſignes ended in a proſperous and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
iſſue.</p>
               <p>They were both of them exceedingly faire and handſome: <hi>Melintus</hi> was
the higher, and of a freer making; his haire, which he wore long &amp; curl'd, was
ſomething browne, and beſides he had certaine Charmes in his face, with
ſuch a pleaſing Majeſty, that made him lov'd and reſpected of all that beheld
him. <hi>Palamede</hi> was flaxen hair'd, his face and body of more fulneſſe, with a
faſhion alwayes cheerely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and who ſeemed but ſeldome to entertaine his
mind with care or troubles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Otho</hi> a Knight of <hi>Rome,</hi> that was afterwards Emperour, was at that time
the moſt powerfull in credit with <hi>Nero,</hi> and hee above all others eſteem'd
their friendſhip, and had favour'd the beginning of their reputation at <hi>Rome</hi>
by making it appeare that they were the two famous <hi>Sycilians</hi> of whom there
was ever report made in the newes that came thither of the victories of
<hi>Corbulo,</hi> Lieutenant of the Emperour, againſt the <hi>Parthians;</hi> under whoſe
conduct they had given proofes of a moſt excellent valour. Many times were
they the firſt that mounted at aſſaults, and leapt downe together from the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7768:6"/>
top of walls into beſieg'd Townes, to ſhew the way to the Souldiers: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times were they the cauſe of winning battels, by opening the thickeſt
Squadrons with furious blowes of their Javelins and Swords which nothing
was able to reſiſt: In ſuch ſort that they were endear'd to all Gentlemen,
and admir'd by the people, being knowne to be of the moſt ancient houſes
of <hi>Greece,</hi> adorn'd with many rare qualities, and amongſt the reſt with a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
that did alike render them lovely and redoubted.</p>
               <p>But Fortune jealous of a vertue ſo high that ſhee fear'd it might ſometime
have the maſtery of her, was pleas'd to croſſe their lives by her moſt cruell
rancontres; for not content to have reduc'd them ſo neere their end, ſhee
provok'd the fury of <hi>Nero</hi> againſt them, and made him reſolve to ſend to
kill them in their lodging, ſo to revenge himſelfe for the accident happened
to him the night before. They ſcarce beganne to ope their eyes to ſee the
day light, when ſome came to advertiſe <hi>Melintus</hi> of that cruell purpoſe, which
would give them no long time to enjoy their life. But all was conceal'd
from <hi>Palamede,</hi> who was in a ſtate ſufficiently miſerable, without adding to it
the feare of that evill that muſt preſently give him ſo unfortunate a cure. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
knew beſides that the night combat hapned by an Ambuſcado that was
laid for them by <hi>Nero</hi> himſelfe under the direction of <hi>Marcellin,</hi> and that the
Emperour had beene hurt in the hand, and <hi>Marcellin</hi> in the arme.</p>
               <p>This man was one of the chiefeſt Miniſters of the paſſions of that young
Prince, whoſe love to <hi>Camilla,</hi> and jealouſie of <hi>Palamede,</hi> made him attempt
the diſpatch of him and <hi>Melintus,</hi> and ſo give paſtime to <hi>Nero,</hi> who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
to walke up and downe by night, fighting with, and killing all hee
met. <hi>Marcellin</hi> having faild that firſt bout, and ſeeing the Emperour anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to revenge himſelfe of his wound, ſufferd not his rage to be cooled, but
reſolv'd on this, that a Tribune by night ſhould goe with guards to maſſacre
them in <hi>Maximus</hi> his houſe, whither they thought them retir'd, becauſe that
was the place where they liv'd.</p>
               <p>This newes that might have daunted the boldeſt ſpirits, wrought no aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
in <hi>Melintus,</hi> who being too couragious to feare death, prepar'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to receive it, being uncapable for his wounds either to reſiſt, or flye:
for although the Emperour at that time knew not where they were, yet that
muſt needs quickly come to his knowledge. That heape of deadly miſhaps
filled the houſe with ſorrow: ſome were dumbe with amazement, others
deſperate to ſee their loſſe inevitable: <hi>Emilia</hi> and <hi>Camilla</hi> would not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
and could not diſſemble before all to expreſſe the exceſſe of their
griefe. Onely <hi>Melintus</hi> continued invincible againſt ſo many miſ-fortunes,
admir'd of by all that ſaw him ſo well prepared to ſuffer without dread the
blowes of Fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arcas, Melintus</hi> ſlave, who never forſooke his Maſter from his youth, and
had alwayes beene a witneſſe of his extreme vertue, and valiant actions, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to have drawne profit from ſo faire an example, for he was very coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous,
and had formed in him ſo great an affection towards <hi>Melintus,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could parallel the care he had to his ſervice.</p>
               <p>This ſlave could not conſider the conſtant face of his Maſter, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of his miſerie, but that his heart overpreſt muſt needs ſend forth
teares into his eyes. In the end, inſpir'd by ſome God, or carried away by
<pb facs="tcp:7768:6"/>
his owne courage, he was bold to propoſe, that if the place where they were
could be for a while conceald, he would aſſure their lives, and that no more
ſearch ſhould be made for them. They would know of him what meanes he
had invented; but he bade them onely be carefull of that hee had declar'd,
and they ſhould preſently know the effect of his reſolution. He went inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of <hi>Emilia's</hi> houſe, towards <hi>Maximus</hi> his, having along with him another
ſlave only that belong'd to <hi>Palamede,</hi> called <hi>Niſus,</hi> whom hee was aſſur'd was
as affectionate as he for the ſafety of his Maſter. When they were come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſhut cloſe within <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamed's</hi> Chamber, <hi>Arcas</hi> ſayes to
him; <hi>Niſus,</hi> I have made choyce of thee to aſſiſt mee in the deſigne I have
thought on for the ſaving our Maſters lives: I am reſolv'd to dye for <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and if thou haſt courage enough, thou ſhalt dye too for <hi>Palamede. Niſus</hi>
without being amaz'd, ask'd him what was to be done? <hi>Arcas</hi> anſwers, Wee
will each of us take a ſute of clothes of theirs, and for feare we be diſcover'd
by thoſe that ſhall come from <hi>Nero,</hi> we will have Helmets on our heads, and
wee'le arme our ſelves with ſwords and poynards as of ſet purpoſe either to
defend our ſelves, or elſe to fell our lives deare, when they ſhall enter the
Chamber: after we have reſiſted a while, wee may disfigure our face with
blowes of our poynards as we receive our deaths, and ſo ſoule it with blood
and wounds, that we ſhall be taken for our Maſters, and ſo appeaſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
vengeance, who will no more thinke of the matter. <hi>Niſus</hi> ſtanding
mute, and muſing on the order of this invention, <hi>Arcas</hi> beleev'd hee had not
reſolution enough for ſo brave a deed, and ſaid to him; What, <hi>Niſus,</hi> doubtſt
thou to dye for a cauſe that ſhall make us the faireſt examples of courage and
fidelity in the world? Hadſt thou rather live in the baſeſt condition of men,
than dye as the moſt renowned of the age? having ſo vertuous and valiant
Maſters, have we not ſo much learn'd as to doe an action wherein they may
be imitated by us? <hi>Niſus</hi> interrupted him, ſaying, <hi>Arcas</hi> leave off perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
mee, I am as reſolute to dye as you. In vaine have I expreſt ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
affection to <hi>Palamede,</hi> if I ſhould not ſhew it now in the moſt important
occaſion of his life: thou ſhalt ſee with what joy I will entertaine death: and
my ſoule ſhould goe her way with more content, if before her depart, ſhee
might know that our Maſters were in ſafety. The gods, replyed <hi>Arcas,</hi> will
doe the reſt, let but us doe our duty: we cannot but dye well ſatisfied; for
if they be to dye, our ſurviving them would be impoſſible; and if wee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
them, what glory will it be, to be commended by them as long as they
live? <hi>Niſus,</hi> let us doe a deed in our life time that hath nothing of the ſlave
in it, and declare that fortune at the leaſt hath not taken from us the liberty
of dying.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the two faithfull ſervants embrac'd one another, and being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
of clothes, helmes and ſwords, they reſolv'd to attend death in that
Chamber where they ſhould be ſought for.</p>
               <p>Though the night was not yet very neare, yet for all that their courage
abated not, but entertaining themſelves with the admirable parts of their
Maſters, they were the more animated to dye for them, and conceiv'd their
end glorious. At the length the houſe was incompaſſed with Souldiers, the
Tribune enters with fifty of the Emperours guard, and ſpeaks to <hi>Maximus,</hi>
who told them, the two <hi>Sycilian</hi> friends were not in his houſe, yet for all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7768:7"/>
that he obey'd the Commiſſion for breaking ope the Chambers. Into <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
his they enter, and find the two ſlaves, worthy eternall memory, each
of them with a ſword and a poynard, and their helmets on, whom they tooke
to be <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede,</hi> that reſolv'd to dye, their Armes in their hands.
The Tribune that came in but with three ſouldiers onely, ſeeing that he was
ſtayed by them; What, ſayes he, dare you reſiſt <hi>Nero?</hi> But they anſwering
nothing, ſet upon them, and ſhewed themſelves along time worthy ſervants
of ſo valiant Maſters: Nevertheleſſe, their deſigne being to dye, and not
to defend themſelves, they gave them no more blowes but what they judg'd
ſufficient to make their diſſimulation the more probable. The Roman ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
who increas'd in number, and wanted neither Art nor Courage, had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
the better of them; and in the end <hi>Niſus</hi> being borne to the ground by
many ſtrokes, and making as though he oppos'd himſelfe to thoſe that were
aſſaulting <hi>Arcas,</hi> to repreſent the deareneſſe of their Maſters, gave himſelfe
three or foure blowes with his poynard on the face, not being perceived. In
the meane while they heard a voyce crying from without, to ſave their lives,
and that <hi>Nero</hi> commanded it. That cry ſtayed the Souldiers, and preſently
<hi>Otho</hi> entring the Chamber, made himſelfe knowne, and ſaid, he brought the
grace that the Emperour gave them. He embrac'd <hi>Arcas</hi> in <hi>Melintus</hi> clothes,
and rejoyced he had eſcap'd that danger: But at the ſame time <hi>Niſus</hi> dyed,
which made him extremely ſorrowfull that he came no ſooner: <hi>Arcas</hi> prayd
him to cauſe the Souldiers retire, that they might ſpeake in ſecret together;
and when they were alone, he puts off his head-peece, which ſurpriz'd <hi>Otho</hi>
in a great amazement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but hee ſoone eas'd him of it, by declaring who hee
was, and the plot that he had laid with <hi>Niſus. Otho</hi> admiring ſuch reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
gave a thouſand praiſes to ſo great loyalty, and made as many wiſhes
that the ſoule of <hi>Niſus</hi> might meet with a place worthy of ſo brave an action.
After care had beene taken of <hi>Niſus</hi> his body, he prayed <hi>Arcas</hi> to carry him
where <hi>Melintus</hi> was, and that he would weare the ſame clothes ſtill. So they
went preſently out of the houſe, but in ſtead of re-aſſuring thoſe of <hi>Emilia's</hi>
houſe, they put them all into a terror at their firſt entry, for that <hi>Otho</hi> brought
a great traine with him, and they were taken to be <hi>Nero's</hi> Souldiers that had
found where the two friends were; yet after that <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Arcas</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
themſelves, the trouble was a little appeas'd till they had ſpoken with
<hi>Melintus. Otho</hi> firſt of all preſented to him <hi>Arcas,</hi> and ſeeing him in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to behold him in that attire, he made a relation to him of his generous
reſolution that was admir'd of all. Then <hi>Melintus</hi> bade him come neere his
bed, and embrac'd him a good while, the poore ſlave not being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
one word, ſo much joy had he, rather to ſee his Maſter out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
than that he himſelfe was left alive. After that, <hi>Otho</hi> told how happily
he came to underſtand towards night the command that was given out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them by the inſtigation of <hi>Marcelline,</hi> without his knowledge, as hee
was alſo ignorant of the night combat: and how he had preſently gone to
<hi>Nero,</hi> and repreſented to him the merits of thoſe he would deſtroy: that he
had knowne them well to be more diſcreet than to have offended his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty:
that <hi>Marcelline</hi> was to be ſuſpected that perhaps for ſome difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had deſign'd their deſtruction; and that he was more in fault than
they to make the Emperour ſerve his paſſions, without dreaming that the
<pb facs="tcp:7768:7"/>
glory of ſo great a Prince might be ſtain'd with the reproach of having put
ſo valiant men to death. That in the end having caus'd the command to bee
revok'd, hee would come thither himſelfe in haſte for feare the execution
ſhould have beene too ſudden. He told him next the griefe he had at his firſt
comming into the Chamber, to ſee one of them already dead upon the place:
after that his miſtake, going to embrace <hi>Arcas</hi> for <hi>Melintus:</hi> yet hee vowed
withall, that his action deſerv'd well other reſpects. <hi>Melintus</hi> after hee had
given him thanks for all the cares he was beholding to him for, enfranchis'd
<hi>Arcas</hi> in his preſence, and promis'd him greater rewards at his returne into
<hi>Sicily.</hi> That change of accidents ſet joy into the place of preceding appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
<hi>Otho</hi> having aſſur'd him, that as long as he ſhould have any power,
they ſhould live ſecurely at <hi>Rome. Melintus</hi> oblieg'd by ſo great favours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more ſatisfied for his friends ſafety than his owne, teſtified by the moſt
affectionate words he could make choyce of, in what ſort he had gaind them
to himſelfe. <hi>Otho</hi> that was of the moſt noble and courteous among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
made an honeſt reply to his civilities, and for feare of troubling him
any more, becauſe he ſpake with paine, tooke leave of him, without ſeeing <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamede,</hi>
who was in no ſtate to be viſited.</p>
               <p>When he was gone away, <hi>Melintus</hi> impatient of ſeeing his friend, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him all had paſſed, roſe up, did <hi>Emilia</hi> what ſhe could to hinder him, who
very carefully aſſiſted: but being in the Chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was forbid to ſpeake
with him by the advice of the Chirurgions, ſignifying what danger he was
in. <hi>Melintus</hi> beganne inwardly to curſe thoſe unfortunate women that
loſt him ſo deare a perſon, and with griefe beheld the faire <hi>Camilla</hi> neere his
bed, who ſpared no paines to eaſe him: But yet <hi>Palamede</hi> drawing the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
perceiv'd <hi>Melintus,</hi> and deſir'd him to come neere; afterwards intreating
<hi>Camilla</hi> to leave them alone together, ſhe withdrew her ſelfe: Then <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
being ſet, with a very feeble voyce he ſpake thus: I was never able to
thinke I could apprehend death, yet never was there any man more loth to
dye than I: I find that I am farre off from the beſt father, and the ſweeteſt
ſiſter in the world, and I dye for a cauſe that will ever be diſapproved of my
deare <hi>Melintus.</hi> It is the greateſt diſpleaſure that can accompany mee to my
grave, that I followed not the counſell of ſo vertuous a friend, but conſtraind
his prudence to obey the tranſports of my youthfull fancies. If the gods are
reſolv'd rather to take my life from me, than make me wiſe by theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
I ſubmit to their juſtice, praying them to give you another friend as
affectionate, but more moderate than I: Yet if your friendſhip cannot eaſily
change the ſubject of it, I have another my ſelfe whom I may well call more
deſerving than I: I leave behind me a ſiſter whom I deſire you to love, if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
as I beleeve, you have not eſteem'd her worthy your affection. I
know your merits be above hers, but yet I am aſſur'd, ſhe will never give her
ſelfe to any man of leſſe worth than you. This conſolation I ſhall have at
leaſt after my death, when I ſhall know that with the goods I am to leave her,
ſhe is to poſſeſſe the greateſt I was able to procure. The firſt words of <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
had poſſeſt with ſadneſſe the ſoule of <hi>Melintus,</hi> and his eyes with teares;
but the laſt ſurpriz'd him with aſtoniſhment; not thinking that <hi>Palamede</hi>
had ever had knowledge of the ſecret love hee had to the faire <hi>Ariana</hi> his
ſiſter, and not willing to avow it, ſeeing ſhee her ſelfe would not have it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7768:8"/>
at all to any, he contented himſelfe to give him this anſwer.</p>
               <p>It were not poſſible for me to have more joy, receiving ſo deare witneſſes
of your friendſhip, if the occaſion thereof were not ſo unfortunate: But I
cannot chooſe but give you thankes for the firſt, and regret the other: and
I will yet hope, that the gods will not ſo ſoone ſeparate us; but that the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of my diſcontent ſhall ceaſe, and I long time enjoy the affection of ſo
perfect a friend. If the eſtate wherein you are, ſuffer'd me to accuſe you, I
might complaine of you for beleeving that I could ever blame your actions:
If at any time I have diſlik'd them, it was rather becauſe my humour was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to them than my reaſon. Cure your ſelfe onely, and imagine not of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
me any perſon that may hold your place. I would not conceive the like
thought of you, that after me you could love any thing. <hi>Melintus</hi> conceal'd
ſo violent and reſpectfull a paſſion for <hi>Ariana.</hi> that he durſt not pronounce
her name, nor ſpeake one word of her, and ſo left off his diſcourſe. <hi>Palamede</hi>
when he had ſtayd a while, ſaid to him, And what ſay you to my ſiſter? This,
replyed <hi>Melintus,</hi> is a matter that I find ſo farre above my merits, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
thin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e upon it without preſumption; and beſides that, <hi>Ariſtides</hi> your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath his deſignes more high in all reaſon; wherefore I content my ſelfe
to honour her with all the reſpect I may. <hi>Palamede</hi> would have anſwer'd this,
but <hi>Melintus</hi> told him, that hee could no longer endure to heare him ſpeake
with ſo much paine, and deſir'd hee would remit that diſcourſe to another
time, and reſt himſelfe for feare of ſome greater danger. I will make but one
requeſt to you, ſaid <hi>Palamede,</hi> to ſend into <hi>Sicily</hi> as ſpeedily as you can to my
father: it may be I ſhall be alive yet ſome dayes, in which time hee may be
here with my ſiſter, or at leaſt render me the laſt duties of a friend, if my
death prevent their arrive: I have no greater wiſh than this, that I may ſee
them before I dye. <hi>Melintus</hi> tooke that occaſion to leave him, after telling
him that he went inſtantly to diſpatch one of his men; and that hee hoped
for all that, when they ſhould be come to <hi>Rome,</hi> they would have more cauſe
to rejoyce for his cure, than to mourne his loſſe. Then ſtudying how hee
ſhould write for putting <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Ariana</hi> into too much feare, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
to diſſemble his griefe as much as might be, and wrote theſe Letters.</p>

               <p>After <hi>Melintus</hi> had clos'd theſe Letters, hee gave them into the hand of
<hi>Arcas</hi> his faithfull Freeman; and inſtructing him what was to be done, gave
him charge to make all haſte, to report <hi>Palamedes</hi> diſaſter in ſuch a ſort, that
they might not be too much affrighted, and to ſay, that he would have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
himſelfe but for a hurt in his hand: then hee went backe againe to his
friend, and diſpatch'd this bearer in his preſence to let him ſee how he obeyed
his requeſt, and to give him this content at leaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcellin</hi> that had alwayes before made eſteeme of <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Melintus</hi>
becauſe of their merits, and had not declar'd himſelfe againſt them, his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
having not yet burſt forth, full of deſpight that they had twice eſcap'd
the death he had prepared them, and not thinking that hee was knowne the
Author of thoſe treacheries, counterfeited himſelfe to be fallen ſicke, and
ſent to know how they did, and that hee was in paine till hee heard from
them. When he had learn'd that his chiefeſt enemy was in the worſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he ſent him an oyntment as an excellent remedy for his wounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but <hi>Melintus</hi> having receiv'd it, would not have his friend make triall of the
Drug, comming from a place ſo ſuſpect. The faire <hi>Camilla</hi> ſent for a Dog
that they preſently ſtrucke with a knife, then ſhe made the Oyntment be
applyed to the wound, and foure houres after the Dogge was found dead,
this compoſition hauing envenomed the ſore, and penetrated in a ſmall time
to the very heart.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of this treaſon made <hi>Marcellin</hi> be as much hated of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla,</hi>
as he had before time beene loved; and when he came to ſee her after
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7768:9"/>
his ſickneſſe, ſhe ſhewed ſuch diſpleaſure at him, that he well perceived hee
was loſt with her. <hi>Melintus</hi> afflicted with his friends evill, though it was
not then judg'd mortall, and ſeeing himſelfe conſtrain'd to feigne a paſſion
for a Lady he loved not, paſſed a very troubleſome life in that houſe. <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
that could not beleeve theſe coldneſſes and diſtaſts of his proceeded from
the ſmall affection he had to her, but rather imputed the cauſe of them, one
while to the misfortune had arriv'd to them, another to his deſire of being
reveng'd on <hi>Marcellin,</hi> never ceas'd rendring him her moſt paſſionate cares.
One day when he was in bed, ſhe ſaid to him; <hi>Melintus,</hi> It grieves me to ſee
you ſo ſad in a place where it is deſired you ſhould be moſt content. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
anſwered he, the greateſt diſcontent I have, is, to put you to ſo much
trouble, and I could wiſh you would be pleas'd to remit the paines you take
to them that ſerve us, ſo I ſhould be eas'd of the halfe of my evill. No, no,
<hi>Melintus,</hi> replied ſhe, hide not your ſelfe from me, this is not the cauſe of
your griefe, for if you love me, you deſire to be loved of mee; and you
cannot receive at this time other teſtimonies of this, than my aſſiſtance, ſo
as my paynes muſt rather be agreeable than troubleſome to you. But in good
truth, dreame you not of revenging you on <hi>Marcellin</hi> for the villanies by
which he purſues the life of <hi>Palamede? Melintus,</hi> who was glad to conceale
the principall ſubject of his ſorrow, was very well pleas'd at her abuſe, and
that he might entertaine her ſtill in it, he ſayes, Madam, 'Tis true, his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
poſſeſſe me with horrour and feare, for I ſee that he will not leave practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
againſt us, and it will be more difficult for us to warrant our ſelves from
a coward and traytor, than an open and valiant enemy. Leave that care to
mee, anſwered ſhee, we muſt by little and little baniſh him our company, and
afterwards wee ſhall know how to preſerve our ſelves from his deſignes:
my ſiſter already hates him, and this have I gained of her, repreſenting to
her how much this fellow is to be deteſted. There is no doubt, replyed he,
but his company is very dangerous, and that ſometime or other, thoſe that
are of ſo miſchievous a diſpoſition will make others that converſe with them
partakers of the miſeries of their owne lives.</p>
               <p>I beginne, though late, ſayd <hi>Emilia,</hi> to ſee the truth of this you ſay; for I
tooke him for a man capable of doing a miſchiefe, yet ſeeing hee did us ſo
many good offices, I could not beleeve hee would attempt any thing that
might occaſion our diſpleaſure. I will not, proceeded ſhee, reproach you
with the ſervice I did you in the perſon of <hi>Palamede,</hi> making him accepted
with my ſiſter: yet I muſt needs let you ſee what affection I beare you, and
what power I have with her, by eſtranging <hi>Marcellin</hi> from her heart, to whom
we cannot deny, but we had ſingular obligations. Whereof, if you have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
I will make a ſhort relation to you. <hi>Melintus</hi> who was well content to
let her have the talke, deſir'd her to take the paines, and ſhee replyed thus:</p>
               <p>Three yeares agoe my ſiſter and I married on one day two Knights of
<hi>Rome,</hi> my ſiſter <hi>Decius,</hi> and I <hi>Antonine:</hi> But ſcarce had ſix moneths paſſed,
but <hi>Decius</hi> quitting the affection he had to my ſiſter, fell in love with mee, at
leaſt he would make me beleeve ſo: I diſcreetly reſiſted him, becauſe I would
not have his intention come to my husbands or my ſiſters knowledge for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering
the friendſhip that was amongſt us, and I hoped alſo that hee
would retire himſelfe from it of his owne accord. This mildneſſe made him
<pb facs="tcp:7768:9"/>
beleeve that in the end I would let my ſelfe be gained, and that nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
me but the affection I had to my husband. On the other ſide, judging
of others by himſelfe, he thought <hi>Antonine</hi> was in love with my ſiſter, and
was againe loved of her, becauſe they entertain'd one another familiarly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
without any great occaſion; whereupon hee conceiv'd ſo furious a
jealouſie, that he reſolv'd to make them both away, this rage of his being
uſefull alſo for the love he made to me, for he pretended to marry me after
he had diſpatch'd thoſe two perſons. One day when wee dined with him, I
was amaz'd to be held backe by him, taking me by the arme, as I was going
to eat of a diſh of meat whereof there was but little in it, and well ſeaſoned
to appearance, he feigning to remember me of ſomething he had to ſay to
me, entertain'd me till <hi>Antonine</hi> and <hi>Camilla</hi> had eaten the moſt of that was
in the diſh, then he made it be taken away. At that time I perceiv'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all, but preſently after dinner, my ſiſters young ſtomacke beganne
to worke, and was ſtrong enough to expell the poyſon ſhe vomited. <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine</hi>
that was more in yeares, and had eaten the moſt of it, finding in like
manner ſome gripings, did what he could to caſt out that hee had taken in,
but he could never doe it whatſoever remedies were given him, and dyed the
day after. The crime and deſignes of <hi>Decius</hi> being apparant enough, you
may conceive how I was tranſported to loſe a husband I honour'd, and with
what fury I attempted to revenge me on him: and hee above all this would
have had me attributed his action to the exceſſe of love he had to mee, and
that I was beholding to him for it. But this mad man being not yet ſatisfied,
but deſirous to have my ſiſter dye what ever happened, I could then deviſe
of nothing but the preſerving of her life by taking her home to me, where
I was reſolv'd to live free without ever marrying againe. In that time <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellin</hi>
fell in love with <hi>Camilla</hi> with ſo violent paſſions, that there was nothing
he would not have enterpriz'd for her ſake: and ſeeing us ever in teares, my
ſiſter and I, ſhe becauſe <hi>Decius</hi> ſought by all meanes to put her to death, and
I for the loſſe I endur'd; he tooke in hand to revenge us both, and to free
us for ever from ſo cruell an enemy. A little while after we underſtood that
<hi>Decius</hi> had beene ſlaine in the Appian high-wayes, and <hi>Marcellin</hi> confeſſed to
us he had caus'd it to be done for our ſakes, which gave me a great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and brought ſo much eaſe to my ſiſter, that for recompence ſhe diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
not to give her ſelfe to him. Since that there hath beene no kind of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances
wherewith he hath not pleaſur'd us, and for which wee account our
ſelves much oblig'd to him. But to his misfortune went ſhee on ſmiling, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
is come from <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> who furniſhed with merits that cannot be refus'd
any thing, hath made me endevour to pull out of my ſiſters affection a man
that ſhe was much ingaged to, and to ſet <hi>Palamede</hi> there in his place. I tell
you not theſe things, to let you ſee that you are beholding to me, nor yet to
entreat you to pardon <hi>Marcellin</hi> in conſideration of us, but that it may appeare
to you, that having had ſo much power over my ſiſter, as to put that perſon
ſo farre out of her heart, I may be able alſo to put him as farre out of her
ſight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> who heard this diſcourſe with much attention, and in the meane
time gave his cenſure to himſelfe of the lives of theſe women that had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
all thoſe tragedies; not beleeving that all ſuch jealouſies happened with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7768:10"/>
cauſe; and knowing that women that live with honour, have not ſuch
diſordered fortunes, diſſembled nevertheleſſe thoſe thoughts, to give her
this anſwer: Madam, you alwayes give mee ſo great teſtimonies of your
friendſhip, that I ſhall remember them every day of my life: but it is not
reaſonable that for our occaſion you ſhould be ingrate towards <hi>Marcelline:</hi> I
had rather for your ſakes pardon him, than you ſhould deteſt him for mine;
one feare have I onely, knowing <hi>Marcelline,</hi> by your diſcourſe, to be a man of
bloud, that we be not forced to goe from <hi>Rome,</hi> or depriv'd of your ſight to
avoyd the effects of his hate, and you may judge how unpleaſing theſe two
things will be to us. <hi>Melintus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Emilia,</hi> doe not thinke of leaving us: I
had rather loſe <hi>Marcelline</hi> for ever, than the ſight of you one moment. It may
be, replide <hi>Melintus, Camilla</hi> had not the ſame deſire. Aſſure your ſelfe, ſaid
ſhe, that ſhe for the moſt part does what I perſwade her to. Madam, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Melintus,</hi> what ever we doe, it will be the moſt expedient to diſſemble
on your part, as well as ours, and in the meane time to keep us to our guards.
I beſeech you therefore, continued he, to intreat <hi>Camilla,</hi> that ſhe would not
uſe him ſo hardly, for making him declare againſt us, and then we muſt needs
depart this City where hee is too powerfull, and loſe you for ever. <hi>Emilia</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him by the hand, anſwered, we will doe all you deſire, doe you but
ſomething in our favour, and love us but as much as we deſire to be loved of
you. Madam, replied he, it is impoſſible for me to love you more than I doe,
and this I call the gods to witneſſe, that know the ſecret of my ſoule. I will
beleeve this, ſaid ſhe, for my owne ſatisfaction; then ſhe left him to go tel her
ſiſter what they had devis'd together, to keepe them a longwhile with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> ſeeing himſelfe alone, beganne to entertaine his thoughts
thus: Faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> what would you ſay if you were preſent? Would you
accuſe me for feigning an affection to <hi>Emilia?</hi> or would you rather pitty me
for the conſtraint I endure? To accuſe mee would be but injuſtice in you,
for diſſimulation is here too neceſſary: and why ſhould you refuſe me your
pitty, knowing that I ſuffer ſo much paine, but for loving you well? But
ſeeing ſhe is not preſent, how unneceſſary are theſe diſcourſes? This faire
creature is now in <hi>Sicily,</hi> who knowes not my griefes; or if ſhee imagines I
am not exempt from them for her love, ſhee thinks I am not vexed but with
the cares of abſence, not being able to fancy this cruell burthen that is come
upon mee. Yet for all this why ſhould ſhe not know my troubles? If I love
her, is ſhe not in my ſoule? and if ſhe be there, is ſhe not witneſſe of all the
torments that accrue to me, for not failing of my fidelity to her? This beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that alwayes forbade me to diſcover my paſſion to her, doth not for all that
deſpiſe it; but deſirous to judge with more certainty of it, ſhee hath lodged
her ſelfe in my very ſoule, where finding ſhe was loved with ſo much arden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and adored with ſo much reſpect, ſhe leaves not that place, but beholds
with joy the croſſes which afflict me, as faithfull proofes of my love, and her
deſerts. What conſolation could I have, if my memory did not let mee ſee
as oft as I pleaſe, this divine image, without which my life would be inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable?
Upon this meditation he reſted him, and ſhutting his eyes, to have
<hi>Ariana's</hi> beauties the better repreſented to him, with all the graces and lights
that accompanied them in his imagination, in this pleaſing trance hee made
theſe Verſes:</p>

               <p>While <hi>Melintus</hi> was carried away with the ſweetneſſe of his imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Emilia</hi> was come to her ſiſter into <hi>Palamedes</hi> Chamber, and had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
a diſcourſe that was very agreeable to them: <hi>Camilla</hi> already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with the love and good grace of <hi>Palamede,</hi> and finding moreover that
ſhe was tranſported with pitty to ſee him ſo ill for herſake, had thus addreſt
her ſelfe to him: <hi>Palamede,</hi> what thing can be capable at this time to give
ſatisfaction to your mind, and comfort to your griefes? Your preſence, ſayes
he, Madam, which cauſes in mee theſe two effects: for although Fortune
hath handled me cruelly enough, I know not how to be angry with her, in
what caſe ſoever ſhe hath led me hither to give me the happineſſe of ſeeing
you at all times. But I would not, anſwer'd ſhe, have you buy my favours
at this price often, for then my good will would be farre more cruell than all
the rigours you could receive: Well, ſee what it is you deſire of mee: your
affection, ſayes hee, which I demand but of grace, though it may ſeeme I
have purchas'd it with my bloud. You ſhould not be here, replyes ſhe, if this
affection were not yours already: but I will aſſure you beſides by an oath I
make you, to baniſh from me what ever you would have me, to love but you
onely. <hi>Palamede</hi> willing to thanke her, tooke her hand, and lift up his head
from the bolſter in paine to kiſſe it. <hi>Camilla</hi> making as though ſhe would have
placed him right againe as he was, for feare he might take harme, came neare
him with her head, and kiſs'd him; and becauſe that, at the ſame time hee
gave a ſtraine that made him feele a ſhooting in all his wounds; Oh gods, ſaid
he, what envious Demon thus intermingles paine with joy? Then <hi>Camilla</hi>
bowed downe, and kiſſing him againe, ſaid; I will not have you be the laſt
in paine. Madam, ſayes he, I am aſham'd to let you goe all the way, but if I
were cur'd, you ſhould not thus prevent mee. We muſt, ſayes ſhee, take pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the ſicke, and doe for them what they would willingly doe themſelves
in another ſeaſon. Madam, anſwers hee, if it pleaſe you ſometimes to take
this paines for me, I promiſe to returne you foure times as much when I am
in health. I will not ingage you, replies ſhee, in ſo great debts, that you ſhall
never be able afterwards to pay me. I ſweare to you, ſayes hee, that as ſoone
as I am well, theſe ſcores ſhall the firſt be acquitted. <hi>Emilia</hi> ſurpriz'd them
in this loving entertainment, and after ſome common diſcourſe, ſhee adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd
them what <hi>Melintus</hi> and ſhe had conſulted of concerning <hi>Marcelline:</hi> but

well enough, but knowing he deſir'd to keepe ſecret his affection, hee
was wel content to favor this diſcretion of his, ſince he lov'd to live after that
faſhion and ſo was reſolv'd never to enquire for any knowledge in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but at what time <hi>Melintus</hi> ſhould think it ſeaſonable; ſo much reſpect had
he to this vertuous friend of his: When he perceiv'd he had done reading, that
he might keep him from ſuſpecting of his regarding of any thing, he preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him thus: The letters you ſent them ſince the diſpatch of theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will make
our excuſes, if we ſhould ſo ſuddenly goe to them. The excuſes, anſwered
<hi>Melintus,</hi> are very lawfull, but yet they will not be very acceptable to them;
and now I finde you paſt all danger, I repent me, that I obeyed you, and gave
them ſo much feare. My ſiſter, replies <hi>Palamede,</hi> will not be angry, that I have
given her this occaſion to ſee <hi>Italy:</hi> but that they may finde us both in good
eſtate, returne you to your bed againe, for I am ſure you have need of reſt,
for the paines you have taken for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> went backe againe to his Chamber, where being alone he thanked
<hi>Ariana</hi> in his mind, for the care ſhe had taken to ſend this letter to ſecure him
from feare, well perceiving it was rather addreſt to him than to her brother:
and judging more to his own advantage of the ſtate of his loves, than he durſt
have hoped heretofore, hee was reſolv'd to endure patiently the conſtraints
wherein he found himſelfe obliged to <hi>Emilia:</hi> and his wounds being clos'd

the extremity of <hi>Palamedes</hi> ſickneſſe, had ſo weakned him,
with the cares he was tormented with, that his body was not
able to reſiſt ſo much paine. This accident renued <hi>Emilia's</hi> feares for his life,
and ſhe blam'd her ſelfe for ſuffering him to be ſo carefully diligent about <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamede:</hi>
Nevertheleſſe, with the remedies they applied, that Fever was not
very violent.</p>
               <p>It was at that time that newes was brought them, how <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and the
faire <hi>Ariana</hi> were arriv'd, and dyed for impatience of ſeeing them. <hi>Palamede</hi>
could hardly yet goe, but was made to be carried to <hi>Melintus</hi> bed, and was
deſirous his father ſhould finde him up, to remove feare from him at this firſt
enterview; yet for all this, he was very ſorry the lot was fallen upon his friend
at that time. <hi>Emilia</hi> was ſitting upon the bed, little thinking that <hi>Melintus</hi> at
that occaſion ſaw her but with regret in the place, and <hi>Camilla</hi> was entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Palamede,</hi> when <hi>Ariſtides</hi> came in, followed with the faire <hi>Ariana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he had embrac'd his ſonne, and expreſt to him the joy he conceiv'd
to find him a great deale better than he look't for, <hi>Ariana</hi> tooke off the vaile
that hid her face, and diſcover'd ſuch beauties that ſhe dazell'd all thoſe that
beheld her. Shee had a ſweet Majeſty, that filled mens minds with admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and aſtoniſhment: her complexion was delicate, and of a bright white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
her eyes ſent forth a lively and delicious light, and conſpir'd with the
pleaſing features of her face to compoſe a charme to amuſe reaſon with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
while they tooke her captive. It ſeemed the center of her faire cheeks
was red by the neareneſſe to the fire of her eyes, or elſe that the blood was
retir'd into ſo ſmall a ſpace, to offend as little as might be the purity of her
whiteneſſe: her haire was flaxen, and curl'd into rings, her ſhape ſlender,
and her faſhion grave and modeſt: and withall, her clothes after the <hi>Sicilian</hi>
faſhion did ſo well accompany all theſe graces, that there was not any one, but
was raviſh'd in ſeeing her. She was followed by a young Gentlewoman call'd
<hi>Epicharis,</hi> that waited on her, whoſe beauty had beene conſider'd, but for
<pb facs="tcp:7768:12"/>
                  <hi>Ariana's,</hi> and who had ſometime beene lov'd of <hi>Palamede.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This view caus'd very different effects in the place, for it poſſeſs'd <hi>Palamede</hi>
with joy to ſee his deare ſiſter: <hi>Melintus</hi> with admiration, and at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
with ſhame to be found among thoſe Ladies, who though handſome,
were moſt unworthy, as he thought them, of his love: and he fear'd that <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
gave a judgement of him, which would greatly wrong the opinion ſhe
had conceiv'd of him. <hi>Emilia</hi> and <hi>Camilla</hi> conſider'd her rather with the eyes
of envy, than admiration; but <hi>Camilla</hi> having no cauſe to be jealous of her,
becauſe ſhee poſſeſs'd her brother, gave up that paine wholly to <hi>Emilia,</hi> who
failed not to marke the changes of <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Ariana,</hi> and from thence ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
conſequences which ruin'd her deareſt hopes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariana</hi> her ſelfe was not able to hinder the appearance of the trouble her
thoughts had brought her to, if ſhe had not beene aſſiſted by the occaſion of
going to kiſſe her brother, by whom ſhee ſtayed the longer, to have her red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

as much as was neceſſary, when <hi>Ariſtides</hi> had taken his ſonne apart
to entertaine him, ſhee addreſt her ſelfe to the ſicke man, who at her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
felt the motions of a thouſand differing paſſions. Shee thank'd him
for the cares he had taken for her brother, and pray'd him to ſuffer, that ſhee
might give him the like aſſiſtances, for to ſatisfie ſo many obligations. Faire
<hi>Ariana,</hi> ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> you are borne to command, and not to ſerve: your
preſence is ſufficient in a place to drive away from it all kinds of evill: and
ſince your arrive I find my ſelfe ſo eaſ'd, that I hope I ſhall not bee any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
trouble ſome to theſe Ladies I have receiv'd ſo many good offices from.
Although all theſe words were ſo many deadly blowes to the deſignes of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia,</hi>
yet ſhe would needs mingle her ſelfe at this diſcourſe, and anſwer him,
That perſons of their worth could never be importune: that there was much
more appearance, that he ſhould be weary in being with her: that ſhee well
ſaw <hi>Ariana</hi> came to deprive them of that they had ſo carefully conſerv'd: But
yet in what place ſoever they were, they ſhould never meet with hearts ſo
affectionate to their ſervice. Theſe laſt words ſhee pronounced with ſome
trouble, which obliged <hi>Melintus</hi> to ſay to her; Be ſure, Madam, you have not
ſo ill an opinion of us, to beleeve one may ſo eaſily eſcape out of your hands.
Then ſeeing ſhe ſtood mute, as full of aſtoniſhment, and to give her reſpit to
come to her ſelfe againe, he purſues; I am aſſur'd that <hi>Ariana,</hi> acknowledging
here ſo much brights, and beauties, and ſeeing us on all ſides encompaſſed
with fires, muſt of neceſſity feare for our ſakes, judging well how difficult
it is to avoyd the faire deſires you give birth to, and all thoſe torments that
accompany them. Beſides, the evill that retaines us in this place, is the leaſt
of theſe we are ſenſible of: you would not be ſo diligent in curing that you
are the cauſe of, and is the greateſt: But for all that, I will not uſe reproaches
againſt perſons we are ſo beholding to: it ſhall ſuffice me to tell you, that you
are too aſſur'd of our engagement, ſeeing that beſide what we owe your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
fortune was willing to binde us for ever to you for ſo many carefull aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances.</p>
               <p>Theſe words reſtor'd a little the ſpirit of <hi>Emilia;</hi> and <hi>Melintus</hi> thought it
ſitting ſo to diſſemble, for not provoking her, and give themſelves meanes
to retire from them: withall, he ſpake thoſe words in ſuch a faſhion, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7768:13"/>
                  <hi>Ariana</hi> knew it was but feigned, for if the diſcourſe had beene true, he would
not ſo confidently have uttered it before her: Nevertheleſſe ſhee could not
but feare, and was preparing her ſelfe to heare <hi>Emilia's</hi> anſwer at the very

               <p>This good father was very joyfull to ſee his ſonne out of danger; but yet
he was not over-well pleas'd to finde him in that place with voluptuous and
magnificent women: though being diſcreet and of a good nature, he made
no appearance of it; and after he had enquir'd of his ſonne the cauſe that

his diſcretion would not permit him to tell, eſpecially before thoſe Ladies
who made up a great part of their adventures. And beſides, he was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that <hi>Epicharis</hi> ſhould be preſent, for feare ſhe might heare of his infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and when they were alone together, he began thus:</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>DEare ſiſter, my humor being ſo welknown to you, I beleeve you are al in
a readineſſe to underſtand many follies, when you deſire to know what
my life has beene, ſince I left <hi>Sicily.</hi> And ſometimes as I am conſidering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my unruly diſpoſitions, I thanke the gods for having given mee a ſiſter,
whoſe vertue oftentimes reclaimes me by her example, and a friend whoſe
good counſels correct my evill inclinations, and are remedies for thoſe errors
my proneneſſe makes me incurre: I will tell you therefore that from <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi>
to <hi>Rome</hi> no very remarkable thing arriv'd to us: nevertheleſſe we wanted
not recreation; for the pleaſant wit of <hi>Melintus</hi> produc'd ſuch merry occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
that our Ambaſſadours themſelves could not live without us, and
having had experience of his vivacity and prudence, and ſome freedome in
me, they deliberated of nothing, without communicating it to us. So wee
came into this City, where <hi>Melintus</hi> delayed not long to bee made knowne,
and to gaine us the friendſhip of thoſe that held an eſtimation of honour and
good birth. By little and little we put our ſelves into the knowledge of the
moſt powerfull men, of whom there were but few that were not pleas'd to
be viſited by us; yea, many times they came to ſeeke us out for to goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the publike exerciſes, and to enjoy our converſation: wherein I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
the force of <hi>Melintus</hi> worth, that made homage to bee given it in an
age ſo corrupted.</p>
                  <p>I vow to you, that the ſtately glory and magnificence of <hi>Rome</hi> beganne to
dazell mee: I deſpis'd our Townes, and the rareſt things I had ever ſeene
<pb facs="tcp:7768:13"/>
in <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Aſia:</hi> I found nothing ſo majeſticall as the Emperours Court, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo grave as that Auguſt Senate, nothing ſo pompous as the Roman La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which appear'd to me ſo many Princeſſes: In the end I forgat all that
ever I had heretofore accounted wonderfull, to tye my ſelfe to theſe rich ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and admire them: but in ſtead of abaſing mee by the conſideration of
their greatneſſe, my courage was bold to advance it ſelfe cloſe to them, and to
pretend to make me conſiderable even with the moſt illuſtrious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melintus</hi> regarded all theſe things with another eye, and in ſtead of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
himſelfe to them by admiration and aſtoniſhment, he abaſed them under
him, yet not by too ſevere a wiſdome, but by a wholeſome knowledge of the
vanity of theſe grandeurs, which he could make no eſteeme of, but when they
ſerved for ornaments to vertue.</p>
                  <p>You know that my heart cannot long time endure without paſſion, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left with the ayre of my Countrey, the affections alſo I had there, I
thought the time long, till I were already engag'd in the ſearch of ſome one
of thoſe great Ladies, with whom I promis'd my ſelfe more felicity than the
gods themſelves taſte of.</p>
                  <p>One day when they carried us to the Theatre to ſee the ſpectacles, I happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be very neere to two Ladies, whoſe beauty preſently drew my eyes
that way, and they were ſo faſtened on that conſideration, that <hi>Melintus</hi> being
aware of my great attention, paſs'd his hand before my ſight, and ſaid to me
laughing; You are ſeeking to have your ſelfe hurt, beleeve me, and retire your
ſelfe. I was at that time ingag'd in the choyce I was to make of one of theſe
two, and that ſurprize did ſomething divert me from my thoughts, though
not from my deſigne; I confeſs'd to him that I found them very handſome,
and that I would be very deſirous to be able to come neere to them; but the
preaſe was ſo great about them, that that was impoſſible for me. They were
ſet upon rich ſeats, having cuſhions under their armes, and under their feet;
and that delicateneſſe pleas'd me infinitely: they that were about them did
their duties with ſuch reſpect to them, that this very honour added yet much
more to the eſtimation I beganne to have of them. She that was neareſt me
ſeem'd to have more ſweetneſſe, and more familiarly to treat thoſe that
ſpake to her: The other appear'd more ſevere, and of an humour to uſurpe
a great Empire over them that ſought to ſerve her. For me that deſire not
to employ ſo many dayes in the purſuit, and when the quality of theſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and the quantity of ſuters perſwaded that I ſhould but loſe my labour,
I was reſolv'd for her I found moſt eaſie, and that ſeem'd alſo to have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in her more agreeable. I enquir'd after their names, and learn'd how
they were call'd <hi>Emilia</hi> and <hi>Camilla,</hi> two ſiſters, widowes, whoſe beauties
were of a very high eſtimation at <hi>Rome;</hi> the one of them, which was <hi>Emilia,</hi>
had not any favourite in appearance, uſing contemptuouſly all her lovers,
and governing her ſelfe with much diſcretion: and the other that was neareſt,
call'd <hi>Camilla,</hi> amongſt thoſe that ſerv'd her, had the rumour to bee entirely
poſſeſs'd by <hi>Marcellin,</hi> one moſt powerfull neare the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>The authority of this rivall a little amaz'd me, but yet it made me not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd,
but contrary I beleev'd I might more eaſily obtaine a good that
was granted to another: and when I was at my lodging, I beganne to muſe
and walke about a great pace: <hi>Melintus,</hi> that had obſerv'd how I had ſtaid
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7768:14"/>
my ſelfe long upon <hi>Camilla's</hi> face, ſet him alſo to walke up and downe, and
muſe as I did, and after many turnes he came neere me, and ſaid, Hide not
from mee your thoughts, and I will tell you mine: Never, ſaid I to him,
have I conceal'd any thing from you. I will tell you then, ſayes hee, that
within theſe three or foure houres I am extremely in love. And ſo am I alſo,
anſwer'd I. Can that be poſſible, replyes he? But may I tell you the ſubject of
my affection? As freely, ſaid I to him, as I ſhall tell you mine: I love, ſaies
he, one of thoſe Ladies that ſate neare us at the Theater: I anſwer'd him,
and ſo doe I; but which of them pleaſes you beſt? Shee that ſhall pleaſe
you leaſt, ſaid he to me. But I aſſur'd him that I would alwayes receive law
from him, ſo farre was I from preſcribing him any thing. I will tell you then,
continued he, that I love <hi>Camilla.</hi> I ſaid to him, a little aſtoniſh'd, and I
alſo; then recomforting me, I added, but for a ſmall matter you ſhall give
me at my returne, I quit her to you, upon condition you will aſſiſt mee to
gaine <hi>Emilia.</hi> And I, ſayes he to me laughing, give you both of them for
the intereſt I pretend in them. Then, comming to my ſelfe, and knowing
he would mocke me, I ſaid to him, that he would thinke himſelfe wronged
to have theſe Dames accounted worthy of him: But for my part I was not
ſo delicate, and would ever ſeeke out pleaſures proportionable to my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and my power. I feare me, ſaid he, leſt your humour carries you to a
place where your power ſhall not be receiv'd: then ſeriouſly he repreſented
to me the troubleſome encounters I ſhould meet with in that purſuit, that
ſame Lady being pre-poſſeſt, and that rivall too powerfull, and already in
poſſeſſion: but theſe difficulties rather increas'd my deſire, than his reaſons
diminiſhed it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I ſtudied the meanes to have entrance into her houſe, and that
was not very hard for me, for the two ſiſters refus'd not perſons of honeſt
quality the acceſſe to it, and ſo by the interceſſion of one of our friends, wee
were ſoone receiv'd with honour. <hi>Melintus</hi> was not there any long time, but
be made himſelfe be knowne for a moſt compleat Gentleman, and beloved,
as in all other places he frequents.</p>
                  <p>I never envied at the eſteeme was made of him, but yet I was angry that
he that had the leaſt deſigne was beſt entertain'd: yet my free humour was
not very diſagreeable to <hi>Camilla:</hi> Shee lov'd to laugh, and I am none of the
ſaddeſt: ſhe was delighted to heare me play on the Harpe, and many times
mingled her voyce with my ſounds, which thing got mee a little familiarity
with her. When I would have opened the matter of my affection to her, ſhe
receiv'd at firſt my words as comming from courteſie that obliged me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the particular eſtimation I had of her: but becauſe I would not leave
her in that opinion, and deſir'd ſhee might be aſſur'd of the violence of my
paſſion, I ſaid to her, Madam, you have not a beauty that will be lov'd onely
for good faſhion ſake. I beſeech you to beleeve for a truth, that as you are
the faireſt, ſo I am the moſt paſſionate of the world, and that no conſideration
ſhall ever hinder me to dye at your ſervice. <hi>Camilla</hi> ſeeing ſhe was to anſwer
theſe ſpeeches otherwiſe than ſhee had done the other, ſaid coldly to mee,
that it was but a very little while that ſhe knew mee, to bee aſſur'd of my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour:
and that ſhe would teach me hers, which was to know well how to
puniſh thoſe that abus'd her freedome, and take away the favours ſhee had
<pb facs="tcp:7768:14"/>
granted them, when they beganne to ſeeke for other favours they ought not
to pretend to. Theſe words which I underſtood not, a little amaz'd me, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
I ſaid to her preſently; And my humour alſo, Madam, ſhall bee,
never to love any but you, what ever rigour it ſhall pleaſe you to declare.
The comming in of <hi>Marcelin</hi> brake off that diſcourſe, yet as ſhe roſe up
ſhe ſaid beſides to me; If you be wiſe you will change your ſpeech and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
and ſo left mee as much confounded as I had beene all my life time.</p>
                  <p>A little after I went out, leaving <hi>Marcelin</hi> with <hi>Camilla,</hi> and <hi>Melintus</hi> with
<hi>Emilia.</hi> Shee, as you have ſeene, exceeds not her ſiſter in beauty, but
much in wit, and knowledge how to get credit and authority over them
that ordinarily ſee her, and <hi>Camilla</hi> too leaves her ſelfe wholly to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melintus</hi> in the evening returning home where I was, found mee ſtudying
the wayes to gaine the good graces of <hi>Emilia,</hi> ſo to attaine thoſe of her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and caſting upon a thouſand fancies, one while on the condition of
my fortune which I found ſo broken downe; another while on the meanes
of relieving it. Seeing mee ſo ſad and penſive, he came to tell me, little drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of my diſpleaſure, that he beganne to be of this minde, that one could
not be happy without loving. I ſaid to him, that this happineſſe is often mixt
with bitterneſſe: for all that, ſaies he, I ſee you ſo well pleas'd, and paſſe ſuch
ſweet houres with <hi>Camilla;</hi> but to me that can find here no beauty to pleaſe
me, entertainments of women are but puniſhments. Then I look'd upon
him, and ſeeing he could not hinder himſelfe from laughing, I cryed out,
Ha! <hi>Melintus,</hi> mocke not at the afflicted: is this the care you ought to have
of helping me, and one of the effects of that friendſhip you promis'd me, for
to pleaſe your ſelfe in augmenting my griefe? This is not my ayme, ſayes he
to me, to torment you, but to make you know, that you are to follow my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
another time. I confeſt to him that I had beene faulty, but ſince I was
entred into that ſtreight, I muſt either paſſe through it, or dye. And what
helpe, ſayes <hi>Melintus</hi> to me? Your ſelfe, anſwered I. If this meanes, ſayes
he to mee, be as profitable to you, as it is ſure, I account you already very
happy: you are but to propoſe that you deſire I ſhould doe. Feigne your
ſelfe, ſayes I to him, to be in love with <hi>Emilia,</hi> and having acquir'd her good
graces, oblige her to give me part in her ſiſters. Doe you beleeve, ſayes hee,
that I can doe that with <hi>Emilia,</hi> which you cannot with <hi>Camilla?</hi> or that I
may obtaine by a fained, that which you cannot by a reall affection? Doe but
try to love her, ſaid I, in deed, and you will take pleaſure to ſerve my turne
and your owne alſo. He anſwer'd me, if I be as unfortunate as you, who ſhall
comfort us then? I am aſſur'd, ſaid I, you will not be ſo, for already <hi>Emilia</hi>
admires the good qualities are in you, and will without doubt joyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the offer of your ſervice. I did never, ſayes hee, obſerve any thing in
me that might give me this preſumption, yet I confeſſe that I cannot eſteeme
of that is in her, nor love a thing that has ſo many faults, as there are in thoſe
kind of women that give entertainment to all commers, and whoſe vanity,
avariciouſneſſe, and impudence are inſufferable: well for all that, after I had
let him ſpeake many things againſt theſe women, I knew ſo well to worke
the forcing of his humour for my ſake, that in the end hee promis'd mee to
feine a loving of her, ſince nothing but his paines remain'd to ſerve me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7768:15"/>
out feare to engage himſelfe, and aſſur'd me that he would employ all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
he could have, to favour my purpoſes, not willing to pretend any
other favour for his ſervices.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be, <hi>Ariana</hi> interrupted him, but <hi>Melintus</hi> is a deſpiſer of women,
to have had ſo much trouble to be reſolv'd of ſacrificing ſome houres for
your contentment. It is not, replied <hi>Palamede,</hi> that he deſpiſes them: for
he never is wanting to give that honour and eſteeme that is due to thoſe he
ſees, but I beleeve that to this day he has not found any thing that deſerves
to be perfectly lov'd of him, and that a vertuous man as he is, is not pleas'd to
ſpeake one thing, and meane another: and in that very thing I was aſſur'd of
the friendſhip he bare to mee: for againſt his owne mind he ſo counterfeited
to give himſelfe to <hi>Emilia,</hi> that I thought he had beene in love indeed. It
may be, replied <hi>Ariana,</hi> the counterfeiting turn'd into earneſt, and this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull
man finding facility and ſweetneſſe would not contemne that good
fortune was preſented to him. You ſhall heare, continues <hi>Palamede,</hi> in what
ſort he us'd his advantages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Emilia</hi> untill then had made nothing appeare to all her lovers, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and indifferency, yea ſome had ſhee handled with ſo much cruelty,
that deſpaire had reduc'd them to extreme reſolutions: for there is no doubt
but ſhe hath charmes unavoydable to any other but <hi>Melintus,</hi> and is skill'd in
the managing of wits with ſo much dexterity, that ſhe acquires an abſolute
command over all that approach her: among the reſt ſhe was more continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſerv'd by one call'd <hi>Trebacius</hi> Captaine of the Emperours guard, who for
all the paſſionate duties a lover could performe, had proved all the rigours
that a Miſtris could inflict: But that woman that had brought forth ſo
much love without receiving any, did at this time take, without giving
any.</p>
                  <p>At firſt meeting ſhe receiv'd with joy <hi>Melintus</hi> offers, as a conqueſt ſhe had
deſir'd, having then no other plot, but to keepe that acquiſition, yea ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
not to glory of it, and to ſignifie her contentment to her other lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
the more to provoke them: ſhe us'd them with more cruelty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
than ever, in ſuch ſort that <hi>Trebacius</hi> not able to indure ſuch ſenſible
objects of ill intreaty and jealouſie, was in the end forced to reſolve with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
never to ſee her more. But love that would be reveng'd of all her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines,
made her obſerve ſo many perfections in <hi>Melintus,</hi> and ſweetneſſe
in his converſation, that ſhe began to feele cares, and unquietneſſe when he
was abſent, and motions of joy (which were not ordinary with her) when
ſhe ſaw him. She would have rejected thoſe torments, which were not
knowne to her but by the complaints of them ſhe had made ſuffer ſo much,
but it was impoſſible for her; and in the end ſhe was brought to that paſſe,
to comfort her ſelfe in this beleefe that <hi>Melintus</hi> felt no leſſe torment for her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melintus</hi> ſoone perceiv'd the effect as well of his words, as of his duties,
and thought it fit for the good ordering of this advantage that he muſt faigne
not to ſeeke out of diſcretion what he ſhunned out of deſigne. He gave me
advice of all; and we had ſo order'd the matter, that for not provoking of
<hi>Marcelin,</hi> I was not before him to expreſſe any purpoſe for <hi>Camilla,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make him beleeve that we had too much reſpect to him for to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
upon his loves. This aſſurance wee gave him, and ſome good offices
<pb facs="tcp:7768:15"/>
wee did him, gained us intirely his friendſhip, even ſo farre, that he made
report of us to the Emperour, and made him deſirous to ſee us.</p>
                  <p>Then lived I happy enough, becauſe <hi>Melintus</hi> willing to avoyd the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of being alone with <hi>Emilia,</hi> that he might not have cauſe to preſſe her,
had found out a device to deliver himſelfe out of that pain, and give mee
much commodity and content. For having obſerv'd that <hi>Marcelin</hi> made
himſelfe a ſtates man, and would ſeeme able to ſpeake upon any kind of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
yet and ſought his entertainment, to make it appeare that he loved
no company to that of the learned, at what time <hi>Melintus</hi> ſaw him moſt buſie
about <hi>Camilla,</hi> he entred in his diſcourſe with <hi>Emilia</hi> upon ſubjects that were
very high; and <hi>Marcelin</hi> leſt he might ſeeme to recule for ignorance, left <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>
to joyne himſelfe to thoſe diſcourſes which <hi>Melintus</hi> knew how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
and then to begin others, wherein <hi>Marcelin</hi> was ſo farre ingag'd, that he
loſt the remembrance of <hi>Camilla,</hi> and ſo left me the place free; while <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
alſo deliver'd himſelfe from the diſcourſes he had beene oblig'd to hold
with <hi>Emilia</hi> altogether contrary to his thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Since the cruell anſwer <hi>Camilla</hi> gave mee, I dar'd not take up that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
any more, fearing I might wholly ruine my ſelfe; only I rendred her
little devoires and complaiſances, ſtaying till <hi>Melintus</hi> might oblige <hi>Emilia</hi>
to ſpeake ſomething in my favour: in the end was this occaſion preſented.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Marcelin</hi> had ſpoken of us to the Emperour, and amongſt other of <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
qualities, had commended him for making excellent Greeke verſes, and
had ſaid of mee that I could play on the Harpe; nay more, that therein wee
had beene Victors in <hi>Greece</hi> at the Olympique games: theſe were then the
deareſt paſtimes of that Prince, to compoſe and repeat verſes upon the
Theatre, and to play and ſing in preſence of the people, to the envy of thoſe
that were acquainted with ſuch exerciſes. <hi>Melintus</hi> and I having ſaluted
<hi>Nero,</hi> he commanded us to prepare our ſelvès two dayes after to aſcend the
Treatre with him, and diſpute the prizes appointed for the Conquerours.</p>
                  <p>It was againſt his will that <hi>Melintus</hi> reſolv'd to obey, and appeare in an
action ſo little becomming the greatneſſe of his courage: But yet though it
were ſome ſhame to ſee ſo great a Prince ſo paſſionately to ſeeke for honours
ſo vaine, and ſo unworthy of his Majeſty; when I ſaw my ſelfe upon the
Theatre proudly clothed, with the chiefeſt men of the earth, upon cloth of
gold and purple; the Emperours guards about us, and an infinite number of
people ſhowting with acclamations and applauſes, my heart conceiv'd joyes
my mouth is not able to expreſſe. Only I will tell you that <hi>Melintus</hi> appeared
in his rang attir'd like <hi>Orpheus,</hi> when he went to hell to demand <hi>Euridice,</hi>
and repeated that Elegant Poeme you have ſometimes heard him ſpeake of,
with which he ſo raviſht the peoples eares, that the end of his repetition was
followed with a thouſand acclamations of applauſe.</p>
                  <p>I was diſguiſed into <hi>Apollo,</hi> and had a laurell neare me to repreſent him when
<hi>Daphne</hi> whom he purſued was chang'd into that tree, and accommodating
my voyce to the Muſique of my Harpe, I ſung theſe verſes.</p>

                     <hi>Camilla</hi> and <hi>Emilia</hi> were not very farre off us, and I was more pleas'd that
<hi>Camilla</hi> approv'd, with a nod of her head, that I had ſung, than with ſome
clapping of hands that followed in my favour. When all had beene preſented
in their turnes, and they were to judge of the prizes, <hi>Nero</hi> was proclaim'd
Conquerour: Yet the ſecond honours were adjudg'd to us. <hi>Melintus</hi> receiv'd
a crowne of gold inrich'd with diamants and pearles; and I a Harpe adorn'd
with a thouſand Emeralds, upon whoſe top is a Lions head with open jawes,
and the tongue that comes out of them made of an intire ruby. I wonder,
ſaid <hi>Ariana,</hi> juſtice ſhould be given to ſtrangers, when in appearance it was
not well kept in the perſon of <hi>Nero.</hi> If the Judges, replies <hi>Palamede,</hi> were not
ſo juſt as they ſhould have beene, the Emperour himſelfe corrected their
judgement, which thing got him leſſe envy, and <hi>Melintus</hi> the more glory, for
having receiv'd the crowne of laurell, he put it upon <hi>Melintus</hi> head, and to
teſtifie the pleaſure he had taken in hearing him recite, he offred him any
ſute he would make. <hi>Melintus,</hi> after he had thank't him for ſo many favour<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
without much conſidering on the matter demanded of him, as you have
heard, the exemption of cuſtomes for the City of <hi>Syracuſe. Nero</hi> admiring
his generoſity for preferring the good of his country to his particular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb facs="tcp:7768:16"/>
granted him his requeſt, with other privileges for our City, and gave
him many preſents beſides; and more than that, he gave us the title of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of <hi>Rome,</hi> with all the honour he was able to favour us with.</p>
                  <p>This Prince hath good intermiſſions, and ſometimes does actions worthy
of his greatneſſe, but they are preſently darkned by a number of prodigious
crimes, wherewith he nothing feares to ſtaine the honour of his Majeſty:
and very often he pleaſes himſelfe, to exerciſe the greateſt cruelties upon
thoſe he hath made moſt of, as but lately his Mother, <hi>Burrus,</hi> and many others
ſerve for examples, and we our ſelves a few dayes ſince were very neere run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the like fortune. But let us leave theſe troubleſome thoughts, to purſue
the happy adventures arriv'd to us in this famous journey.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Palamede</hi> would have gone forward with his diſcourſe, <hi>Ariana</hi> and
he heard a noiſe in <hi>Melintus</hi> chamber, as it had beene of many perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to viſit him. By and by they were ask'd for, becauſe it was <hi>Otho</hi> that
came to take leave of them, going to make a great voyage. And already was
he ſpeaking to <hi>Melintus</hi> in ſecret, and <hi>Palamede</hi> being admitted, he learn'd
them theſe ſad newes, that he was in diſgrace with <hi>Nero,</hi> that the Emperour
was in love with <hi>Sabina</hi> his wife, and would have her wholly to himſelfe, and
for that cauſe ſent him to the fartheſt of all <hi>Spaine</hi> to governe <hi>Luſitania:</hi> That
it much grieved him to leave them to the mercy of <hi>Marcelin,</hi> whoſe favour
augmenting with the ſpoyles of his, it was to be feared they fell not into his
power: But that they might ſecurely ſerve themſelves of thoſe friends were
left them in <hi>Rome,</hi> who were not unknowne to them. <hi>Melintus</hi> deplor'd his
misfortune, and expreſt to him how great a part they tooke in his diſgrace,
that depriv'd them of a friend ſo earneſt for their ſafety. But he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
to give over that ſpeech, becauſe <hi>Otho</hi> regarding nothing was ſaid to
him, was ſo attentive in conſidering <hi>Ariana's</hi> marvellous beauty, that nothing
could divert him. <hi>Palamede</hi> ſaid to him, ſhe you looke on is my ſiſter, who is
come hither from <hi>Sycily</hi> with my father, having underſtood my ſickneſſe.
<hi>Otho</hi> for all that, ceas'd not to ſtudy, having his eyes continually fixt upon
<hi>Ariana;</hi> then all on the ſuddaine they ſaw him bluſh; and a little after that
bloud which had diſpearc't it ſelfe upon his cheeks was forc'd to run towards
his heart, that would have beene gone to hinder his departing, &amp; left his face
without colour. <hi>Otho</hi> finding himſelfe to faint, pray'd <hi>Palamede</hi> to cary him
into his chamber, and that they might be there alone. As ſoone as they were
entred, he let himſelfe fall backward upon the bed. <hi>Palamede</hi> ask'd him what
he ailed, but he could not anſwer. What effect more ſuddaine and more
rare could an excellent beauty produce? But it ought not to be found ſo
ſtrange, conſidering the divine aſpects of <hi>Ariana,</hi> working on a ſubject nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh't
up in delights, and capable to receive eaſily thoſe ſtrong impreſſions.
<hi>Otho</hi> in the end after a great ſigh, ſaid to <hi>Palamede:</hi> Ah! deare friend how
dangerous was the ſight of your ſiſter to mee, and what troubles hath ſhe
made mee in ſo little a time. I did at firſt meeting receive this ſight with ſo
much liking, as it had beene a remedy happily ſent from heaven againſt the
diſpleaſures I endur'd: Me thought I entreated that faire face to bring
forth a paſſion in mee, that might diſpell the cares of my diſgrace, and the
cruell regret for <hi>Sabina's</hi> loſſe: But wretched exchange, and cure that
brings mee death! I loſt all in one day, my delights, my honours and the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7768:17"/>
moſt aſpiring hopes of the earth, and having found a ſubject to be admir'd
that might reſtore to me a thouſand times more goods, that I muſt loſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in an inſtant. I came hither, having my foule troubled with griefes,
and found that they were diſſipated by the joy that happened to me for the
birth of ſo faire an affection: but preſently the conſideration of my depart
within an houre came to attach this new love, and ordain'd it either to dye,
or to be the moſt unfortunate that ever entred into a heart: for to make it
dye, I cannot ſo much as will the deſtruction of it: and to conſerve it, I know
not ſo ſtrongly how to conſent to my owne miſery, as to keep a remembrance
that would be the more cruel to me in my exile, the more amiable it appear'd.
And theſe are the contrary thoughts, <hi>Palamede,</hi> that aſſaulted me all at once
with ſuch fury, that they caus'd the diſorder you ſaw me in: Excuſe, I pray
you, my tranſportation: I beleeve that this day ſome ſtarre caſts upon me his
moſt malignant influences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Palamede</hi> knew not what to ſay to him upon ſo ſtrange an accident: hee
would have condol'd his misfortune, had not the cauſe and remedy ſo nearely
touch'd him: To offer him his ſiſter, ſhee was not in his diſpoſing: and to
promiſe him aſſiſtance neare her, if he had had the will to it, the time was too
ſhort for hope to get any advantage by it. In the end he reſolv'd with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to make no overture to him, but to expect it from him, and ask'd him
what he deſir'd he ſhould doe to ſerve him. No, no, <hi>Palamede,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Otho,</hi>
be not you in paine to helpe me. I wiſh to your ſiſter the greateſt felicity of
the world, ſo farre am I from willing to make her a companion of my miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
I am a miſerable baniſh'd man, the hatred of heaven, and caſt-away of
the earth, which ſcarce affords me one of her extremities to be ſuſtain'd in:
no other comfort have I deſir'd of you, than that I receiv'd in telling you
the extremity of my miſery, which never ſhall be heard ſpoken of by any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
you. Adieu, deare <hi>Palamede,</hi> enjoy a better fortune: I demand you no
other favour but to ſhew me the way to get out of this lodging without paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
by the Chamber where ſhee is that I have ſeene too much for my repoſe.
I ſhould feare leſt the ſight of mee might not offend the happineſſe of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
graces, by the contagion of my miſhaps: or elſe leſt her regards which are
more cruell to me, might not make my evill incurable by new hurts. I will
hope that the remembrance of that I have ſeene but one moment, may in
time be effaced; and I perceive well that I ſhould make it immortall, if I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
it to acquire more ſtrength. He beſought him after that to make his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
to <hi>Melintus</hi> for going his way without ſeeing him. <hi>Palamede</hi> proteſted
to him, that he lamented his torment, and that hee was willing to eaſe him
with the loſſe of his bloud, in ſatisfaction for ſo many favours wherewith he
had oblig'd them. <hi>Otho</hi> gave him thanks for his good will, and having learn'd
a ſecret backe way out, tooke leave of him, to carry with him into <hi>Spaine</hi> a
memory of <hi>Ariana,</hi> which both made the way irkſome to him, and a great
part of his ſtaying there alſo; but in the end, his farre remove, time, and his
ambition more than all things, cur'd that wound with much adoe, ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
does a rare beauty imprint her marks upon a ſoule that is noble and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.
<hi>Palamede</hi> being return'd to <hi>Melintus,</hi> made relation to him of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Otho's</hi> trouble, diſcourſes, and reſolution. <hi>Melintus</hi> in his heart was
not offended for his remove, ſeeing himſelfe freed from a rivall too puiſſant,
<pb facs="tcp:7768:17"/>
although he had ſorrow to loſe a friend ſo affectionate, and that had hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo much credit: Nevertheleſſe he diſſembled what he thought, to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at ſo ſudden an affection: then after he had ſaid, how it was not needfull
to make that accident at all be knowne, <hi>Ariſtides, Emilia,</hi> and <hi>Camilla</hi> came
neare, to whom <hi>Melintus</hi> conceiv'd he might diſcover <hi>Otho's</hi> diſgrace, ſeeing
it was already divulg'd at <hi>Rome:</hi> Every one bemoan'd him, becauſe hee had
many excellent qualities, and among the reſt, a liberality without example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Palamede</hi> tooke his ſiſter againe to tell her what had come to paſſe, at that
time he ſaw the reſt ingag'd in that diſcourſe, and having led her into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chamber, he made her bluſh when hee acquainted her with the ſudden
love of <hi>Otho,</hi> which matter being not fitting for her to heare continued, ſhee
to breake it off, oblig'd him to finiſh the hiſtory he had bogun, whereof ſhee
was impatient till ſhe had learn'd the end. He conſented to what ſhe deſir'd,
and thus reaſſum'd his diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>I beleeve we were interrupted, when I was telling you, how we went out
of the Theater, where we had gotten honour enough, if it were honourable
at all there to appeare. After we had left the Emperour, we were accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
to our houſes by our friends, and a part of the people: but it was a very
long while to me, ere I was rid of ſo much company, to goe ſee <hi>Camilla.</hi> We
feined to be weary of the tumult and croud, which made them all take leave
of us; and inſtantly I pray'd <hi>Melintus</hi> to goe along with mee to the ſiſters.
They were then alone, for <hi>Marcelin</hi> had waited upon <hi>Nero</hi> to the Palace; and
at our comming, come, ſayes <hi>Emilia,</hi> let us goe receive theſe Conquerours
with the honour is due to them. <hi>Melintus</hi> putting one knee to the ground,
ſaid to her; We come to preſent theſe Conqueſts at your feet, ſeeing that
we hold them of you. Yet did not I, replyes <hi>Emilia,</hi> compoſe the verſes you
recited; and for me, ſayes <hi>Camilla,</hi> I cannot play on the Harpe. The love,
ſaid I to her, we have for you, is ſo powerfull, that it made us vanquiſh all
that is in <hi>Rome.</hi> It was ſufficient, added <hi>Melintus,</hi> that you favourably look'd
upon us, becauſe fortune can refuſe nothing to them that have that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
The pleaſing <hi>Camilla</hi> replied with her accuſtom'd mirth, If our eyes
obtain'd this victory, I find them to be excellent Poets, and good players on
the Harpe. I ſaid to her, they are farre more cunning than wee, for they can
make themſelves be loved, which we have not bin able to doe yet. This is a
difference, ſaid <hi>Emilia,</hi> we muſt end in particular, and drawing <hi>Melintus</hi> apart,
left me with the faire <hi>Camilla.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we were ſet, I was a little aſtoniſh'd, not daring yet to ſpeake free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of my affection to her: Nevertheleſſe ſwollen with the good fortune of
my victory, and ſeeing her looke with a very cheerefull countenance, I ſayd
to her, that there was no contentment that was not accompanied with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
and at that very time we are accounted moſt happy, we have often
moſt occaſion to complaine of Fortune. It is true, anſwer'd <hi>Camilla,</hi> but what
cauſe have you to ſpeake this? Becauſe, ſaid I the people to day thought me
well pleas'd, and I find before you my condition very miſerable. If that be
ſo, replies ſhe you are to avoyd my preſence with great care, and ſeeke for
publike aſſemblies where Fortune is ſo favourable to you. But, ſaid I to her,
if I cannot wiſh for happineſſe without you, it would be but an untoward way
to be happy, to flye from you. If you ſeeke, ſaid ſhee, this good, to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7768:18"/>
of as much as tis poſſible for a perſon of your merit to be, you ought
not to thinke your ſelfe miſerable with me. The merit, continued I, is not
great, when it cannot prevaile to make me belov'd. Your merit, ſaid ſhee, is
powerfull enough, ſince it makes it ſelfe belov'd of me. And my perſon? ſaid
I then. I eſteeme it, anſwered ſhee. Nothing elſe, replide I. I honour it, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſhe. Oh the gods, cried I out, what of honour, what of eſteeme, and no
love! I know not, ſaid ſhe, what you ſpeake of. Of a thing, anſwered I, you
are not ignorant of, ſeeing you have learn'd it me ſo well. 'Tis then, ſayes ſhe,
a want of will. Wherefore, went I on, will a perſon of ſuch perfection have
this want? ha, well, ſayes ſhe, I will have a will for you. But, anſwered I, I
would have a good one. And I will give you, ſayes ſhe, an ill one. I replide,
Would you then be ſo cruell? Will you, continued ſhe, that we fall to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement?
This, ſaid I, is the favour I demand. Let us part, ſayes ſhe, equally,
you ſhall have an indifferent one. I expected ſome more favourable anſwer,
and replied to her, that I would not have a thing ſhee was ſo free of to all the
world. Had you rather, ſayes ſhe, have particular evils, than common goods?
I aſſur'd her, that I deſir'd neither one, nor other: Nevertheleſſe, anſwer'd
ſhe, you are to chooſe: and I ſaid to her, I had rather leave you both of them.
I will, ſaid ſhe, prevent you, and ſo ſhe left me, going away towards <hi>Emilia,</hi>
who being angry becauſe ſhe interrupted her diſcourſe with <hi>Melintus,</hi> ask'd
her why ſhe had quitted me. <hi>Camilla</hi> anſwered her in laughing, and walking
up and downe the chamber, he is a man that pretends to more than one vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
in a day.</p>
                  <p>I could not tell then whether I ſhould account my ſelfe happy, or unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
having taken hold on no word that were to my advantage, and yet ſhee
ſpake all theſe things with a pleaſantneſſe, which gave me cauſe to hope well:
and I would have gone to intreat <hi>Emilia</hi> that ſhe would be Judge of our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
when <hi>Marcelin</hi> came in to breake our diſcourſe. We gave place to
him, and after ſome ſpeaking of what had beene done that day, I left him
with <hi>Camilla,</hi> and making ſhew as if I would have buſied my ſelfe in the
meane time upon ſomething, I tooke a Harpe, and ſung theſe verſes, which I
made heretofore when I lov'd <hi>Epicharis.</hi>

                     <hi>Camilla</hi> perceiv'd well they were addreſt to her: yet ſeeing ſhee was too
much employ'd with <hi>Marcelin,</hi> I ſet by the harpe; and <hi>Melintus</hi> longing to
tell me what he had done for mee, advertis'd mee to goe out. I tooke leave
therefore with ſatisfaction ſufficient, for that I had made my entrance with
<hi>Camilla:</hi> but the condition of my affaires was yet in better termes on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide; for being retir'd at home, <hi>Melintus</hi> told me, how <hi>Emilia</hi> began to
ſpeake thus to him: What thinke you of your fortune to day? That it is
favourable, ſaid he, in what leaſt concernes me, and contrary in what I moſt
deſire. And what can <hi>Melintus</hi> wiſh for, replied <hi>Emilia,</hi> that he may not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
with thoſe advantages he is poſſeſt of? The honour of your good gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſaid hee, which I ſeeke for with ſuch paſſion. I will not, ſaid ſhe, have it
my fault, that this day be not entirely happy to you, for I give you that place
in my ſoule which you can deſire there. I receive, ſaid he, this favour, with
the ſubmiſſions I am bound to, acknowledging my ſelfe unworthy of it, and
make an oath upon this faire hand, never to abuſe it. Are you content, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plide
ſhe, with me? More, anſwers <hi>Melintus,</hi> than I could ever have hoped.
But I am not, ſaid ſhee, ſatisfied with the preſent I have made you, but in
imitation of the Emperours magnificence, and acknowledgement to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts,
that are better knowne to me, than to him, I make offer to you alſo of
what ever ſhall pleaſe you to deſire of me, my honour reſerv'd. <hi>Melintus</hi>
feigning a joy unhoped for, ſaid to her; Seeing it pleaſes you to grant me ſo
much grace, I accept it, and to make it appeare that I perfectly love what I
have undertaken to ſerve, I aske you no other favour, but to order the matter
ſo, that <hi>Palamedes</hi> ſervice may be accepted of <hi>Camilla,</hi> afterwards I may think
of making my ſelfe happy. I beleeve, ſaid <hi>Emilia,</hi> that this day you have
forgot your ſelfe, to conſider the contentment of others: but ſeeing this is
your requeſt, you ſhall ſee in what faſhion I will employ me with her: yet
for all that, I will not have this be to you in ſtead of any obligation. <hi>Melintus</hi>
thank'd her for this aſſurance, and repreſented her with the paine I was in,
and the need I had of her ſuccour, when <hi>Camilla</hi> forſaking mee, went to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7768:19"/>
breake off their entertainment.</p>
                  <p>Deare ſiſter, you may imagine, how well pleas'd I was at theſe newes:
for knowing that <hi>Emilia</hi> deſir'd to give greater proofes of her love to <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
I aſſur'd my ſelfe ſhe would let her ſiſter be quiet, untill ſhe had given
her good words for me: and I was not deceiv'd with this hope: for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
<hi>Camilla</hi> began to make more eſteeme of me; beſides, to beleeve theſe
aſſurances I gave her of my love, and to oblige me by her anſwers, and in the
end to expreſſe an affection to me: nay one day ſhe told me I had a good
friend of her ſiſter. You know me too well, to thinke I would loſe theſe
advantages: ſo I urg'd her in ſuch wiſe, that by little and little ſhe engag'd
her ſelfe to me, allowing me little favours, whoſe permiſſion made me an
eaſie way for greater; In ſuch ſort, that ſerving my ſelfe with the occaſion,
one day as I found her upon a bed. <hi>Ariana,</hi> bluſhing, interrupted him, and
ſaid, hold you there, brother, I feare you will tell me things I would not
heare. Then ſaid <hi>Palamede</hi> to her, Siſter, I find it very pleaſant, you ſhould
feare to heare tell of my good fortunes, and be in no apprehenſion by and by
to underſtand the miſery came upon us. I ſhall ever be glad, ſaid ſhe, to
know that all good fortune attends you, but you ought to be ſilent in theſe
particulars. <hi>Palamede</hi> replide, how he was not altogether ignorant how it
became him to ſpeake to her; and that he was very ſory nothing had paſs'd
that might have oblig'd him to conceale it, for that having found her upon
that ſame bed, he could never obtaine any thing of her, with all his labour
and intreaties, whereof he would make no relation, becauſe ſhe was not
pleas'd with it: then he went on; I vow, I have not retention enough, long
time to conceale a good fortune. I began to be weary of my diſcretion that
bound me to diſſemble before the meaneſt of that houſe: beſides me thinks
it were to ſhew ones ſelfe unthankfull to fortune, not to publiſh her benefits,
and if I were govern'd by my owne humour, ſhe ſhould never have cauſe to
complaine of me, becauſe I would alwayes make her favours greater by my
repetition of them, to confeſſe my ſelfe the more beholding to her. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
being to follow the advice of <hi>Melintus,</hi> and commands of <hi>Camilla,</hi>
who fear'd to have our intelligence knowne to <hi>Marcelin,</hi> becauſe he held her
in an Imperious way, I was ſome while ſurmounting my ſelfe, and admiring
the diſcretion I obſerv'd: But in the end ſeeing that a chamber-maid nam'd
<hi>Cyane</hi> was for the moſt part about us, and made me loſe the good houres I
had paſs'd with more freedome, but for her, I reſolv'd with my ſelfe to gaine
her, to the end, that if ſhe were an ordinary witneſſe, ſhe might alſo be a
complice. I kept me cloſe from <hi>Melintus</hi> to practiſe this maid, which I have
ſince repented ſufficiently, becauſe without doubt, he had let me ſeene the
miſery I went to engage me in. So I made her ſome preſents, whereby I
thought her wholly mine, and diſcover'd to her the good will her Miſtreſſe
bare mee. She faign'd to underſtand this newes with content, and promis'd
me her ſervice in what ever I could deſire of her. See how capable we are
to forget our ſelves: for thinking her more uſefull to mee than any body,
I retir'd more in her confidence, than in <hi>Melintus</hi> his himſelfe, and told her
all had paſs'd with <hi>Camilla</hi> and I, whereof <hi>Marcelin</hi> failed not to be adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed,
as we came afterwards to know. I perceiv'd well he did no more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
mee with that freedome he was wont, but judging no other cauſe of it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7768:19"/>
but his inequall humour, I omitted not to purſue my fortune and deſignes.
Hitherto had <hi>Camilla</hi> intertain'd me with hopes, and <hi>Melintus</hi> had avoided
the too-great expreſſions of <hi>Emilia's</hi> love: But one morning when we were
all foure of us alone together, my impatience prevail'd with mee to conjure
<hi>Camilla,</hi> by my moſt ardent affections to grant mee a favour, which ſhe from
day to day defer'd. Dare you, ſayes ſhe, demand ſo unreaſonable a thing, in
the preſence of my ſiſter and <hi>Melintus ?</hi> I am aſſur'd, ſaid I to her, ſhe is of
opinion, that a thing promis'd muſt be paid; and <hi>Melintus</hi> deſtrous of the
ſame favour with her, without queſtion will be of my mind: I was willing
thus to ingage him againſt his will, becauſe I knew <hi>Camilla</hi> would never make
me happy, but after his ſiſters example. Thoſe words oblig'd <hi>Melintus</hi> to
ſignifie the ſame deſire to <hi>Emilia,</hi> and the repulſe ſhe gave, was rather an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to him to ſeeke to vanquiſh her, than to loſe all hope. We left off
ſpeaking <hi>Camilla</hi> and I, to ſee what they would reſolve on, and refer'd to
them the cauſe of all foure, attending eagerly the ſucceſſe of their diſpute:
and for all I perceiv'd him to plead but coldly, I would not be perſwaded
but he would carry it. Yet ſeeing that <hi>Emilia</hi> would not wholly agree to
a thing <hi>Camilla</hi> had altogether refus'd, I conſider'd there was need of ſome
paines-taking on my part, and ſo in the end I obtain'd this of her, to referre
her ſelfe to her ſiſters judgement. I well perceive, ſayes <hi>Emilia,</hi> tis a hard
matter to put you off: but that we may be aſſured whether you ſhall perſiſt in
the ſame reſolution, we give you the reſt of the day for terme, and at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
you ſhall come hither all alone by a doore I ſhall cauſe to be kept ope: if
then you ſhall give us aſſurance of the ſame deſires, we will give you that
we ſhall reſolve on for your advantage. That favourable decree confirm'd
by the conſent of the faire <hi>Camilla,</hi> was entertain'd of me with exceeding
joy, and of <hi>Melintus</hi> with thanks for us both. <hi>Ariana</hi> taking the word from
him, ſaid to her brother, I doubt not, but in his mind he was glad this good
fortune offer'd it ſelfe, without coſting him the leaſt unquietneſſe. Whether
he were ſcornfull, or no, replied <hi>Palamede,</hi> you ſhall know by the ſequell:
then he went on.</p>
                  <p>After many thanks wee tooke our leaves of them, but before our going
out I advertis'd <hi>Cyane</hi> of our appointment, that ſhe might take care for our
entrance, never dreaming that in one inſtant I loſt what we had obtain'd
with ſo much labour, and words. The remnant of that day me thought
houres never paſs'd away ſo ſlowly, ſo impatient was I, and ſeeing <hi>Melintus</hi>
penſive on the other ſide, I ask't him whether he thought not long till
the night came, as well as I. We are meditating, anſwers he, upon very
differing matters. I ask't him the cauſe; Becauſe, ſayes he, that you would
already be at the place of aſſignation, and I am thinking what to doe, not to
come there at all. I found him very diſdainfull to ſhunne that that others
would with ſo many vowes deſire; he confeſt to me, he was of a contrary
humour, and that he could not reſolve to goe to <hi>Emilia:</hi> This reſolution put
me into a great wonder, and I began to curſe that coldneſſe and continency
that ſo croſs'd my happineſſe: for having had good ſucceſſe but by his meanes,
without him I would promiſe my ſelfe nothing: Nevertheleſſe ſeeing that
ſurpriſe had taken my ſpeech from me, with a faſhion more remiſſe he ſpake
to me thus: I beleeve you deſire not to compell me to that I am moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7768:20"/>
of; alſo it is not reaſon I deprive you of a benefit I have gain'd you
with ſo much adoe, and you ſo ardently deſire: A meanes muſt be invented
to content us both. And what meanes, ſaid I, for my part, I cannot expect
any fortune, if I be not aſſiſted by you: for thinke you that <hi>Emilia</hi> will ſuffer
her ſiſter to favour mee, when ſhe ſees her ſelfe deſpis'd of you? If your
paſſion, ſayes he to me, blinded you not, you would conſider how I would
not propoſe to find out a remedy that I had not thought on: doe but heare
at leaſt, if that I have devis'd be not poſſible. We will goe at the houre aſſign'd
with ſome of our men, and counterfeiting a rancounter at the dore, we will
take our ſwords in our hands one againſt another; and after having made ſome
noyſe with our weapons, I will retire my ſelfe with the reſt, as if I were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued,
and you ſhall enter alone into the houſe, making as if you thought me
to be there already: then a while after I will ſend to tell you, that you be not
in paine for me, that I was releiv'd by ſome of my friends with whom I was,
and who would not ſuffer me to come. And to what end, ſaid I, is all this
labour? for me I had much rather come to receive the kindneſſes of a faire La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
So ſhould I, ſayes he to me, if I were <hi>Palamede:</hi> but ſince I am <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
ſuffer me to live after my owne faſhion. I find, ſaid I, that it is but an ill
meanes of ſecret entry into an houſe, to goe make an uprore at the gate. Nay
contrary, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> if there be any ſpie there, he will flye away for feare;
and nothing will ſtay in the ſtreet, ſo I find, it needs not be deſpair'd,
that a man may enter into a lodging by this meanes: But, ſaid I to him, this
will be alwayes to begin againe: thinke you every night to uſe the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe?
It is well, ſayes he, your foreſight goes ſo farre: Cannot you tell how
to keepe that to your ſelfe, which I ſhall once have acquir'd you? Conſider
only for the preſent, and I ſhall adviſe for us both for the time to come:
Time will afford us counſell. I agreed at laſt to what he would.</p>
                  <p>But conſider, my Siſter, how vertue, and good counſels are accompanied
with proſperity; if it had not beene for this humour and reſolution in <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
wee had beene utterly loſt, and yet we failed not to runne into a very
great danger. That ſame <hi>Cyane</hi> having beene acquainted with the houre of
our comming, preſently advertis'd <hi>Marcelin</hi> of it, who provok'd by jealouſie
and deſire of revenge, reſolv'd our death, and would ſerve himſelfe with the
preſence of the Emperour to cover his aſſaſſinate. In the evening being at
ſupper with <hi>Nero,</hi> ſeeing that Prince ſomewhat inflam'd with wine, and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome verſes he had made, he ſaid all alowd that ſome dayes agoe,
he was not able to endure the inſolence and ingratitude of that <hi>Sycilian,</hi> who
mock'd at the Emperours verſes, and every where vanted his owne, for all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of ſo many favours he had receiv'd of him. <hi>Nero</hi> incens'd
at theſe words, for there was nothing that ſo ſenſible prick't him as to be
ſlighted in a thing where he affected the greateſt glory: In what places, ſayes
he, does this companion thus uſe me? I heard him alſo, anſwered <hi>Marcelin,</hi>
but two dayes ſince when he ſpake of this matter with a ſtrange impudence
at a Ladies houſe, that every night entertain's him. Can we not, ſaid <hi>Nero,</hi>
entrappe this ſame gallant? This very night, replies he, it will be very eaſie
to be done: we need but goe to waite for him, and hide us ſome where there
abouts, you may puniſh him your fill for the crime he commits every day
againſt the honour of your Majeſty. This was inſtantly reſolv'd on, and
<pb facs="tcp:7768:20"/>
                     <hi>Nero</hi> with thoſe of his ordinary troup, went to put himſelfe in ambuſh at a
place whither he was conducted by <hi>Marcelin,</hi> and ſtaied for us with a purpoſe
to ſacrifice us to his vengeance.</p>
                  <p>We failed not to come at the houre, and preſently, as we had order'd the
matter together, we beganne to draw our ſwords, in making a noyſe, and to
cry, kill, kill, the murderers. <hi>Nero</hi> and the reſt thinking they had beene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
and fearing to be all maſſacred in their Ambuſcado, if they iſſued not
out, ſhewed themſelves, and came to us, but ſo much aſtoniſh'd, as we were
ſurpriz'd, not looking that our play ſhould be turn'd into ſo true a combat:
We omitted not to receive them with much aſſurance, and hurt many of
them: Nevertheleſſe becauſe their number was the greater, we receiv'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wounds, which made us reſolve to ſell our lives dearely: but they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
we were deſperate, were in the end forc'd to cry out to us, It was the
Emperour. Then we drew our ſelves further off to let them paſſe, yet after
they had retired themſelves, I fell downe all along, being no longer ſuſtaind
by the heat of the fight, and having foure great wounds, out of which I loſt
all my bloud. <hi>Melintus</hi> came to helpe me, but, for all he was not ſo much hurt,
he could not but fall in a ſwoone alſo upon my body. In this ſtate were wee
found by theſe Ladies, who came out to ſee that which had paſſed before
their houſe, and who were greatly aſtoniſh'd to ſee us handled on that faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Then they caus'd us to be brought hither to ſuccour us with the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they have made demonſtration to us; where being in deſpaire of my
life, I was willing to ſee my father and you before I dyed: But the gods have
ſhewed me more favours than my indiſcreet youth deſerv'd, and have ſpar'd
my life it may be to ſerve you, and that deare <hi>Melintus</hi> to whom I have ſo
many obligations, whoſe ſickneſſe that now keeps him in his bed, was not
caus'd but by the daily cares he tooke for me during mine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariana</hi> fully pleas'd to have learn'd the extreme fidelity of <hi>Melintus,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
that joy to anſwer her brother. It is true that in all that you have
told me, he hath witneſs'd a moſt perfect friendſhip to you, which oblig'd us
to eternall acknowledgements. And I would have the occaſion one day
preſented to acquit us of them: then ſhe ſpake on; But to leave this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of <hi>Melintus,</hi> you have not told me, how you came to know it was <hi>Cyane</hi>
that diſcover'd all to <hi>Marcelin.</hi> This is the thing, replied <hi>Palamede,</hi> I forgat
to ſpeake of: We knew it was he aſſiſted by <hi>Nero,</hi> that made the Ambuſcado
for us, and chiefly we gather'd his ill will by an oyntment he ſent me, which
was poyſon, and then when we were in paine to diſcover from whence hee
could have notice of our appointment by night, I went to averre before
<hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Camilla,</hi> that I had communicated it to <hi>Cyane, Camilla</hi> crying
out then, told me, we need not any more inquire for the originall of this
diſaſter: that this mayd was wholly <hi>Marcelin's;</hi> and cauſing her to be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
becauſe ſhe was now too much inrag'd for all <hi>Marcelin's</hi> treaſons, ſhee
made her in the end confeſſe her villany. I make no report to you of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of our faithfull ſlaves, in purſuing the deſigne <hi>Nero</hi> had taken to put
us to death, becauſe you have heard that of <hi>Arcas;</hi> It remaines onely that I
tell you how <hi>Marcelin</hi> two or three dayes ſince hee was wholly cur'd, came
to viſitus, and ſhew us much affection, to remove the opinion we might have
of him. But <hi>Camilla</hi> could not forbeare to give him ſo ſtrange a reception,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7768:21"/>
that he began to ſuſpect the cauſe of that uſage.</p>
                  <p>I perceive, replide <hi>Ariana,</hi> that by the ſpeciall favour of the gods, you
have beene able to eſcape out of that adventure, for in that ſort your deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was plotted; I tremble ſtill to imagine how it was poſſible for you
to avoyd it: Nevertheleſſe you are not yet out of danger, having alwayes
for enemies the Emperour and <hi>Marcelin</hi> whoſe revenge is unſatisfied, and
whoſe fury ſhall be increas'd by the cares <hi>Camilla</hi> has expreſs'd to have of
you. The gods, ſaid <hi>Palamede,</hi> that have hitherto preſerv'd us, will not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
us: yet we are not to ſleepe, but employ the wiſdome of yours and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
counſels to adviſe of the meanes that may for ever ſecure us from thoſe
miſeries that threaten us. I beleeve, ſaid <hi>Ariana,</hi> that a ſpeedy retrait to
<hi>Syracuſe</hi> will be the moſt expedient; this is that makes mee wiſh the perfect
cure of both of you, that we may enjoy together the repoſe and ſweetneſſe
of our Country, and flye from a City where vice and inſolence reigne with
ſuch authority.</p>

what he could the deſire <hi>Ariſtides</hi> had to heare of all had paſſed,
and employed the greateſt cunning of his diſcretion to find out
cauſes of their misfortune, and conceale the true and principall
occaſions of every thing that had happened; many times when
he was not well prepar'd to anſwer all the good old mans queſtions, he feined
a difficulty of ſpeech by reaſon of his ſickneſſe, to have leiſure to conſider:
But when he had ſcap'd that paſſage, and came to report <hi>Palamede's</hi> extreme
ſickneſſe that his wounds cauſed, and all the accidents that had put him into
ſuch feare, he forgat not ſo much as one point thereof, that he might ſpend
the time in that diſcourſe, and deliver himſelfe from demands he was in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <p>
                  <hi>Emilia</hi> and <hi>Camilla</hi> ſometimes laugh'd, ſeeing in what faſhion hee diſguis'd
the truth, and did oft divert the matter of the diſcourſe to ayd him. <hi>Ariſtides</hi>
was not ſo ſimple to be content with every thing they told; nevertheleſſe
he beleev'd part of it, and well knew how to excuſe the reſt. In the end, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamede</hi>
and <hi>Ariana</hi> came backe againe into that Chamber, and the day being
neere ſpent, <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and ſhe tooke leave of all, with a promiſe to returne the
next day to ſee them: They retir'd them to <hi>Maximus</hi> his houſe, their ancient
hoſt, with whom <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Melintus</hi> had beene ever bold ſince they came
to <hi>Rome:</hi> when they were gone, <hi>Emilia</hi> and <hi>Camilla</hi> entred upon a diſcourſe
of <hi>Ariana's</hi> perfections with great admiration; <hi>Palamede</hi> confeſſing himſelfe
very proud in having ſo compleat a ſiſter. <hi>Melintus</hi> ſpake but coldly of her,
but <hi>Emilia</hi> obſerv'd a great deale of conſtraint in all he ſaid, and was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that if he might freely have ſpoken of her, not any in the company
would have done it more to her advantage. The evening paſs'd away in thoſe
diſcourſes; and when <hi>Melintus</hi> found himſelfe alone, calling for thoſe faire
objects <hi>Ariana's</hi> preſence had renued in him, he began thus to be entertain'd
with himſelfe: Ah! divine <hi>Ariana,</hi> how deare is thy ſight to mee, and how
every time I ſee thee, doſt thou appeare with new perfections? It ſeemes
you came hither to my reproach, that my ſoule conceiv'd not perfectly enough
of you before, and that you will forme in it a new Idea more faire yet than
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7768:22"/>
that I have cheriſht, beauties that ſhall never find your equalls, can I ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
affect you? nay rather can you be more affected? No, conſidering the
love I have for you cannot be greater than it is; but why ſo, ſeeing I feele it
to be every day augmented by the new graces which are continually bred in
you? Oh! the ſight that ſo raviſhes me! Ah <hi>Ariana,</hi> how the glittering of
your beauty repleniſhes my ſoule with light, and how receiving you is my
imagination poſſeſt with joyes! But confeſſe too, deare <hi>Idea,</hi> that thou art
receiv'd into a very pure place, and regard with how much ardour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
thou art there ador'd.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſweet thoughts hinder'd him pleaſingly from ſleeping all night, he
was vexed at nothing but that he was found in that houſe, whereupon he
would faine have ſatisfied <hi>Ariana's</hi> mind. The day after, ſhe came in the
morning with the maid ſhe lov'd ſo well, cal'd <hi>Epicharis,</hi> having left her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at home to repoſe him after the weariſomeneſſe of his journey. When
ſhe knew her brother was not yet awake, ſhe went into <hi>Melintus</hi> chamber, who
receiv'd her with great joy and reſpect, and <hi>Epicharis</hi> being away, when ſhe
was ſet downe ready to ſpeake to him, and enquire of the ſtate of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
he prevented her thus. I am much confounded for this honour you
doe mee, Madam, but yet I am more aſham'd to ſee you in a place where ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
never entred but in your attendance. Never will I, anſwered ſhe, be of
this beleefe, ſeeing you your ſelfe are come hither before mee. Ah! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
replies he, flie from this houſe too unworthy to be honour'd by your
foot-ſteps: if I have ever beene ſo happy to be approved by you for any quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I muſt needs loſe that eſteeme being found where I am: and I conjure you
not to prophane your ſelfe by the converſation of theſe Ladies that are ſo
farre from the honour of your life. I know well, anſwers ſhe, what occaſion
hath brought you hither againſt your will, and ſo farre is it from giving mee
cauſe to blame you, as I ſhall therefore admire your vertue while I live.
When I ſee you among ill company, I ſhould ſtill beleeve it was but to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them by your example, and not to imitate them; I am aſſur'd how
much your honour is deare to you, and am to thanke you for having care of
mine, whereof I would not feare to give you the direction, if I doubted of
my owne. He replide, To doubt of your wiſedome, Madam, never did ſo
criminall a conceit enter into my heart: That were to call in queſtion the
thing in the world I have the moſt perfect knowledge of: But pardon mee,
if I deſire to ſee you be gone from a place which even my honour cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
but with horrour, and where my indiſpoſition retain's mee with ſo
much violence. The rules they here follow are ſo contrary to thoſe you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that I can expreſſe no contentment in the place, but in compelling my
mouth to contradict all my thoughts. <hi>Melintus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ariana,</hi> I would from
this very houre follow your advice, if it were not yet a greater offence to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
my brother, and that man that never yet forſooke him. <hi>Palamede,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plide
<hi>Melintus,</hi> is out of danger, and may goe home to you, and ſince your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
I find my ſelfe too in eſtate to be able to be carried thither; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you to retire you from hence, and to receive this prayer I make you
for the greateſt ſervice I ſhall ever be able to give.</p>
               <p>Strange effects of a vertuous paſſion! <hi>Melintus</hi> in ſtead of favouring the
preſence of his faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> could not endure to ſee her in a place where he
<pb facs="tcp:7768:22"/>
himſelfe would not have beene: his pure and perfect love taking offence at
the leaſt approach of things vicious: and he did even ſeeme to foreſee the
miſchiefe that was to come upon them by the ſtay ſhe made in that lodging,
becauſe that <hi>Marcelin</hi> came to viſit <hi>Melintus,</hi> and entred into his chamber,
when <hi>Ariana</hi> and he were ſpeaking together. This ſight ſurpriz'd them both,
but much more <hi>Melintus</hi> to ſee a perſon he had ſo much cauſe to hate: for
<hi>Ariana</hi> not knowing him, thought only <hi>Melintus</hi> had reaſon to wiſh her farre
from thence, ſince the entrance to that houſe was permitted to all perſons,
and this man might give a ſtrange cenſure of her: Nevertheleſſe <hi>Melintus</hi>
diſſembling, receiv'd him with a countenance open enough, and <hi>Marcelin</hi> after
he had inquir'd of his health, began to regard <hi>Ariana</hi> with eyes of wonder
and ſurprize: But ſhe, to avoyd this curious viewing, and the birth of ſome
deſires in him, made as if, for civilities ſake, that they might be free together,
ſhe left them, and went into <hi>Palamed's</hi> chamber, then preſently ſhe went out
of the houſe, after ſhe had deſir'd him to returne that very day home to his
fathers, where ſhe went to retire her. <hi>Marcelin</hi> fail'd not to demand of <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
who that handſome ſtranger was: to which he was oblig'd to anſwer,
that ſhe was <hi>Palamed's</hi> ſiſter, that was come with her father from <hi>Sicily,</hi> upon
the report of her brothers ſickneſſe, and was to returne ſpeedily thither againe
finding him whole. I did not beleeve, ſayes he, that your Sicilian women had
beene ſo faire, you would but wrong your ſelves to come to ſeeke beauty at
<hi>Rome.</hi> Things, anſwered <hi>Melintus,</hi> that come from a farre off, or that are
ſought in a farre country, ſeeme ever the faireſt: for as for mee, I would quit
all <hi>Sicilians</hi> for one Roman Ladie: And I, replies he, all the women of <hi>Rome</hi>
for this <hi>Sicilian.</hi> That diſcourſe pleas'd not very well <hi>Melintus,</hi> and he would
have beene glad to have beene at <hi>Syracuſe</hi> with <hi>Ariana,</hi> for that he ſuſpected
leſt <hi>Marcelin</hi> loſing <hi>Camilla's</hi> favour might not make his addreſſes to her, and
give them many croſſes that way. And ſo had he purpos'd; but that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
<hi>Melintus</hi> in that apprehenſion was, becauſe <hi>Marcelin,</hi> impatient to ſee
againe at leiſure her that had ſo well touch'd him with love, in ſo little a time,
ſtaid not long to counterfeit a deſire to goe ſee <hi>Palamede,</hi> and parted from
<hi>Melintus</hi> to goe into the other chamber, where he found her no more, ſo as
he was forc'd to entertaine her brother, thinking he might have need of his
helpe, to ſee and be well receiv'd by her; but they had ſtrange plots, one upon
the other. That entertainment was not of continuance, becauſe when there
is queſtion of feigning, the diſcourſes are not long-breath'd, each fearing to
diſcover himſelfe, and ſo the time paſs'd away the greateſt part of it in ſilence.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as ever <hi>Melintus</hi> could come to ſpeake to <hi>Palamede,</hi> he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel'd
him to goe out of that lodging, that very day, and told him, he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the diſpleaſure <hi>Ariſtides</hi> tooke for finding them there, that it were
better he went his way alone, than ſtay for him: that they were to tell the
Ladies, how <hi>Ariſtides</hi> weary of the journey, was fallen ſick: for him, that he
would follow him the day after, and ſo they ought to retire one by one, for
feare the depart of them both might not at one time too much ſurpriſe them.
<hi>Palamede</hi> reſiſted ſome time this advice, for the paſſion he had to <hi>Camilla,</hi>
whoſe ſight he enjoyed with ſuch commodity: Nevertheleſſe it became him
to give place to that friends counſell he had too much neglected to his loſſe;
and this reſolution taken, they were to take leave of the ſiſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:7768:23"/>
                  <hi>Emilia,</hi> that had never obſerv'd in <hi>Melintus</hi> any ſtrong paſſion, what-ever
favour ſhe had expreſt to him, began to be in doubt of the cauſe of his coldnes
to her ſince the arrive of <hi>Ariana.</hi> This ſtately woman who all her life time
ſaw her ſelfe ador'd, without having ever any love, died for deſpite to finde
her ſelfe ſleighted; and when ſhe heard the newes of his retrait, at firſt ſhee
gently replied to the courteous words of <hi>Melintus,</hi> but to his replies, ſhee us'd
reproaches, and from reproaches ſhe enter'd into fury. That rage brake all
the chaines of diſcretion and modeſty. What, ſaid ſhee, after I had diſdain'd
the moſt powerfull men at <hi>Rome,</hi> am I brought to this paſſe, to become ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant
to a ſtranger, and a man unknowne? This ingratefull man, this Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
after receiving ſo much honour at my houſe, after having bin drawne
by me out of the hands of death, dares yet forſake me, and refuſe a few daies
at my intreaty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus,</hi> to ſtop the current of thoſe words, ſaid to her; Madam, I am nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
traytor, nor ungrate, I have loſt neither the reſpect I owe you, nor the
paſſion I had for you: it needs not to employ intreaties where you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
and that which makes me be accus'd for diſacknowledgement, is that,
ſhould rather let you ſee how well I can acknowledge the cares it pleas'd you
to take of me, ſince I deſire to free you of them. Will you reduce mee
to that, never to be able to ſatisfie the obligations I have to you, by never
ending my importunities? and that I ſuffer all my life to be ſerv'd by you,
without a power to doe you ſervice? Beleeve you that when I am at home
I ſhall have the leſſe affection to you? and, will you not ſo much as permit
that I put my ſelfe in the way to render you my duties? Although I honour
your favours extremely, the exceſſe of them begins to be weighty upon me,
ſeeing I no more obtaine them by my ſervices. Madam, if you have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
taken pleaſure to expreſſe ſo good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will to me, envy me not, at my turne,
the contentment of offering you my cares, and obliging you by my ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to continue this affection to me. I beleeve that to a perſon of courage,
there is no puniſhment comparable to this, without ceaſing to receive, and
never give; and this is that you would have mee eternally endure. <hi>Emilia</hi>
ſomething ſtayed by theſe ſpeeches, ſtedfaſtly regarding him ſaid; How
happy ſhould I be, <hi>Melintus,</hi> if you were true: but I feare this faire language
proceeds not from the heart, too much order has it to expreſſe a paſſion: and
you ſeeme rather to affect to ſpeake well, than to love well: tis no matter, I
will beleeve you ſo you will grant me yet two dayes more ſtay, during which
you may find your ſelfe in better health. <hi>Melintus</hi> not willing to put her into
deſperation, anſwer'd her, that ſhee might diſpoſe not onely of two dayes,
but all thoſe of his life, without asking him leave. So they were at accord
together. And <hi>Camilla</hi> much better aſſur'd of <hi>Palamede's</hi> affection, not being
made to oblige her by any compulſion, ſuffer'd him to goe his way, well
knowing ſhe ſhould ere long ſee him againe.</p>
               <p>The diſpleaſure this ſtay brought to <hi>Melintus,</hi> came from hence, that hee
ſaw himſelfe depriv'd, in that time, of ſeeing <hi>Ariana,</hi> and knowing <hi>Palamede</hi>
would not faile to report to her the cauſe that retain'd him, he would write
this Letter to her:</p>

                     <p>TIs not my ſickneſſe now, that retaines me here, but another's, that is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
to me than my owne, rather out of deſpite than pitty I have of it.
'Tis a cruell thing, to be unfortunate by too much good fortune, and not to be able to
eſcape out of that is in my owne power. I beleeve I am deſtin'd to contemne all my
time the good things are offer'd me, and to conſume my ſelfe by deſiring thoſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſſeſſe. When Fortune uſes me the moſt cruelly, ſhe makes me become cruell too:
then ordaines a puniſhment for my diſdaines, in ſtead of rewarding them being ſo juſt.
But ſince ſhe is blind, I appeale from her to your judgement, and aske of you not that
which I refuſe to take of others, that were too great preſumption, but that I even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe

                  <hi>Melintus</hi> gave this Letter in Tables to <hi>Arcas,</hi> his faithfull Free-man, to
whom alone was the ſecret paſſion of his maſter diſclos'd, who would not
hide himſelfe from him in many things he had occaſion to employ him. This
good ſervant the day after that <hi>Palamede</hi> was return'd to <hi>Maximus,</hi> with his
father, tooke the occaſion to goe ſee how hee did from <hi>Melintus,</hi> and gave his
letter ſecretly to <hi>Ariana,</hi> who receiv'd with it ſo much content, that after ſhe
had read it, ſhe promis'd to give him an anſwer.</p>
               <p>Never had ſhe done him that favour, but having lately had intelligence of
ſo many vertues, and merits, by her brothers report; of the contempt hee
had made of one of the faireſt Ladies of <hi>Rome,</hi> for not giving offence to her
love: of the honours he had acquir'd for himſelfe, and benefits he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
for his Countrey, with the reſpectfull cares he had witneſſed for her, at
the laſt viſit; ſhe could not any longer time refuſe him that grace. But go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to write, ſhe was prevented by <hi>Marcelin,</hi> who feigned to make a viſit to
<hi>Palamede,</hi> which courteſie oblig'd her to entertaine him while her brother
came where they were: ſhe knew well he ſought to fall upon ſome words of
affection; but ſhe was wary ſo finely to avoyd his diſcourſe by turning it to
ſome other purpoſe, that he perceived it would be a hard matter for him to
enter in diſcourſe with her upon the ſubject of his paſſion: in ſuch faſhion,
that <hi>Palamede</hi> being come, ſhe left him without having at all advanc'd, but
that he had ſignified his deſire onely: after that ſhutting her ſelfe up, ſhee
wrote, and came to give her tablets to <hi>Arcas,</hi> who rejoycing to beare to his
Maſter ſo deare a pledge, flew till he came to <hi>Emilia's,</hi> and <hi>Melintus</hi> receiving

               <p>Thoſe faire Characters were kiſt a hundred times by <hi>Melintus:</hi> and although
he receiv'd no very open expreſſions of affection, hee did not give over the
good aſſurance of it, knowing how deare thoſe few words had coſt <hi>Ariana</hi>
which ſhe had added in the end of the letter. Hee was therefore reſolv'd to
follow her counſell, and afterwards ceaſed not to let <hi>Emilia</hi> ſee how much
his affection was augmented by the daily cares ſhe had taken for him; and
that he deſir'd nothing ſo much, as to be in perfect health, that by his ſervices
he might recompence a part of ſo great paines. In concluſion, he was ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at diſſembling, that ſhe beleev'd him, and two dayes after ſhee ſuffer'd
him to be gone, upon condition he would often come to ſee her. But when
he was with <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> he ſaw himſelfe reduc'd to fainings of another nature;
for in ſtead of counterfetting an extreme paſſion, which it behov'd him to
doe at <hi>Emilia's,</hi> having none at all, here was he forc'd with much care to hide
that he had indeed, for <hi>Ariana.</hi> His diſcretion was very great, but the paine
this conſtraint put him to, was not leſſe. Onely hee eas'd his griefes by ſome

                  <l>Cloſely to keepe your thefts for all their vengeance?</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Alas, ſaid he to himſelfe, how is't poſſible this fire ſhould continue thus
alwayes? and not onely not come forth, but not ſo much as be ever ſeene?
Yet ſhe forbids me this; but to what purpoſe doe I ſo reſpectfully obey the
lawes of that defence: for if ſhe loves mee, why does ſhee let mee ſuffer ſo
much? and if ſhe loves me not, why will I not comfort my ſelfe at leaſt by
expreſſing the evill I endure? But againe, if I love her, how ſhould I diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
her? Durſt I oppoſe my ſelfe to her deſires? Or having acquainted mee
once what her will is, can I make a doubt whether I am to follow it? it may
<pb facs="tcp:7768:24"/>
be ſhe mean's to prove by ſo cruell a conſtraint, the extremity of her power,
and my affection: ſhould I cowardly loſe ſo faire an occaſion, to make the
greatneſſe of my love appeare to her? No, no, let us ſuffer, my ſoule; let us
burne, my heart; and hold our ſufferings well rewarded, becauſe ſhe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain's
them us. It is enough, that ſhe knowes the cruelty of our paines, and
knowing them, ſhe will know alſo to acknowledge them. But while he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
himſelfe with reſolutions, his fire ſeem'd to increaſe, in emulation, to
ruine them, and this combat being within him, he felt the whole torment of
it: Nevertheleſſe loving equally his love and his diſcretion, he labour'd to
make them both friends, to dwell together peaceably within him, and not that
one ſhould be conſtrain'd to give place to the other: his love impetuous and
boyling never ceas'd to agitate him, and at ſome time he addreſt theſe verſes
to it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ariana</hi> ſaw all thoſe verſes, and acknowledg'd the height both of his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and of his conſtraint; but ſhe thought it was not yet time to give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
either to one, or other, by avowing ſhe would love none but him. She
waited the change that was to be in their fortunes, at their returne in <hi>Sicily,</hi>
and in the meane time favour'd <hi>Melintus</hi> in whatſoever honeſty might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
her. They would gladly have beene gone for <hi>Sicily,</hi> but <hi>Palamede</hi> could
not yet abide travelling, for a great hurt in his thigh that was not well
heal'd; and <hi>Melintus</hi> was all that while forc'd to keepe his bed, waiting for a
perfect cure in <hi>Palamede,</hi> for feare of being oblig'd to wait upon <hi>Emilia,</hi> who
never gave over ſending to heare from him.</p>
               <p>This faigning gave him the commodity to entertaine <hi>Ariana,</hi> for ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
him very carefully, yet ſo much reſpect had he to her, that there was
nothing but his eyes that durſt make love to her, and of every thing elſe they
communicated one to another with much confidence. One morning ſhe
came to him, and bringing a little table booke with her, ſhe pray'd him to
read what was written in it, where he ſaw theſe words.</p>

               <p>Theſe letters ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> put us to no paine, in gueſſing to whom they
are addreſt, nor who ſends them: but, Madam, added he who gave you
them. <hi>Epicharis,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ariana,</hi> found them on my table as I was riſing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being clos'd, for feare, I beleeve, that I ſhould leave them in the ſame
ſtate. But what would you adviſe me to doe? Madam? ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> your
heart is free, you may diſpoſe of it as you pleaſe. you may be deceiv'd for all
that, anſwer'd ſhe, but this is not the thing I aske you; what ſhall I doe
with theſe tables? if you deſire, ſayes he, to anſwer them, you need but ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
the wax, and then write what you pleaſe. You laugh at me, replies ſhe,
and by whom ſhall I ſend them, when I know not who brought them. You
are but to put them ſayes he, in the ſame place, and who ever laid them there,
will know where to take them againe well enough. And what if I will, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plide
<hi>Ariana,</hi> that they be never more ſpoke on? You may, ſaid he, caſt them
into the fire. I am very glad, ſayes ſhe, they have beene condemn'd by your
mouth, and at the ſame time threw them in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> conſidering this action, ſaid to her well enough ſatisfied, if hee
meanes to write often to you, he muſt make great proviſion of tablets. It
will be as neceſſary for him, anſwered ſhe, to be provided of patience, but if
he be opiniated, I ſhall not be without trouble neither: Yet our depart ſhall
quickly deliver us of all. <hi>Palamede</hi> thereupon comming in, and ſeeing the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
burning, ask'd his ſiſter why they were throwne into the fire: She a little
ſurpriz'd, ſaid ſhe would no more make uſe of them. Is it long ſince you
have uſed, ſaid he, ſuch things? ſince I came to <hi>Rome,</hi> anſwered ſhe. Ha!
ſiſter, cryed he out, why are you ſo ſecret to me? you had them but this
morning: and if I had beene willing, you had never ſeene them at all. <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
bluſhing told him, I proteſt that if I had beene able, I had hid them from
my ſelfe, and I thought not they had come to your knowledge: if there had
beene fire in my chamber, I had not burnt them in this, where I found, that
<hi>Melintus</hi> was not ſo curious as you, for he never inquir'd as you have done,
what the matter was. But continued ſhe, can you tell who brought me them?
No, ſaid he, but going into your chamber, while you were yet ſleeping, I
ſaw them upon your table, and put them as they were, ſince they were not
directed to me. I find you, ſayes ſhe, very diſcreet: but you had done well
to have kept mee from the ſight of them. See, replied <hi>Palamede,</hi> if I be not
good to a man that has done me ſo much ill, but I am aſſur'd, you will doe
him no great good. I wiſh only, ſaid ſhe, for his puniſhment, that he may
<pb facs="tcp:7768:25"/>
love me all his life, as much as I ſhall deteſt him for your ſake.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, <hi>Melintus</hi> made himſelfe very ignorant of thoſe tables;
and in the end ask't them what it was. Tis a letter, replies ſhe, <hi>Marcelin</hi> made
mee receive by I know not what meanes, looke if it be not directed to a
good place, for a very favourable reception. His deſert, ſayes <hi>Melintus,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conſiderable, but his misfortune is extreme to fall into your hands, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
us of his. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> comming into the chamber, brake off this diſcourſe,
and <hi>Ariana</hi> leaving them, went out of the houſe, to the next temple, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verd,
as ſhe was accuſtom'd, with a great vaile that hindred her from being
ſeene at all, being not deſirous to make her ſelfe knowne at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the
ſmall time ſhe had to ſtay there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcelin</hi> that ſet a ſpie to watch her going out, fail'd not to follow her,
and approaching to her, when ſhe ſeem'd moſt attentive at her prayers, ſaid:
The gods grant to your deſires as much happineſſe, as you may give me. She
as in amazement, lift up her ſcarfe to ſee who ſpake to her, and let him ſee
her extreme beauty; but armed with ſo much ſeverity, that the ſight infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſtoniſht him, and he receiv'd from her eyes an anſwer more cruell than
her mouth had beene poſſibly able to make him. That uſage made him ſee,
that ſhe was not accuſtom'd to ſuffer ſuch words: and he beleeved, that the
faire ſtranger would never ſatisfie his love, if he ſought not out honeſter
meanes to poſſeſſe her.</p>
               <p>There remain'd a ſcruple in the ſoule of <hi>Ariana,</hi> for having entred <hi>Emilia's</hi>
houſe: She thought her ſelfe prophan'd, and that her honour might be
ſtain'd with that reproach. Every houre, the diſcourſe <hi>Melintus</hi> had with her
to make her get out of that place, came into her minde, &amp; ſeem'd to accuſe her,
ſo as ſhe was reſolv'd to be purified in <hi>Diana's</hi> temple. That very day ſhe
ſpake of it to the prieſteſſe, who was cal'd <hi>Virginia,</hi> and told the cauſe ſhe had
for it. <hi>Virginia</hi> promis'd her the chamber of purifications for the day after, but
the next day ſhe put her off to the eighth day, telling her for excuſe, that
ſome Roman Ladies, whom ſhe could not refuſe, were to be purified during
that time. <hi>Ariana</hi> was forced to have patience till then, and when the eight
dayes were paſt, ſhe was receiv'd into that chamber with <hi>Epicharis</hi> only to
wait on her. This place was as it were a ſecond temple added to the firſt, but
yet leſſer, and of a round figure, whoſe roofe was bigge enough, and that
without appear'd to end in a vault; but within at that time a heaven repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
hid the arches of the vauting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariana</hi> brought in by the prieſt, was amaz'd to ſee ſo much riches in the
place. The hangings were, the ground of gold, and the figures imbrodery
of ſilke. In the middeſt of the chamber was a bed, whoſe valences were of
purple imbroyder'd with gold; of a moſt rich worke, and the curtaines of a
carnation ſtuffe with little flowers of gold. Neare the bed was a ciſterne of
white marble next to the wall, out of which came two great pipes of
gold, that were to open and ſhut, from the one of which was drawne hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and from the other cold. On one ſide of the chamber was a buffet charg'd
with little veſſels of gold, and with great ones of the ſame, inrich'd with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amants,
rubies, and Emeralds: on the other ſide was a table cover'd with a
tapiſtry of the ſtuffe the bed was on, ſuted with moveables of the ſame, and
upon it a great looking glaſſe with a border of the moſt curious gold-ſmiths
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7768:26"/>
worke that was in <hi>Rome.</hi> On the ſide of the ciſterne, was a table charged
with veſſell of Chriſtall and Agath, filled with ſweet waters of all ſorts, with
baſons of the ſame, and great ſtore of linnen clothes to ſerve againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
forth of the bath: the paving of the chamber was of quarries of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and porphry of ſeverall faſhions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariana</hi> after having admir'd theſe ſumptuous things, and beene inſtructed
by <hi>Virginia</hi> about the ceremonies ſhe was to obſerve, was left alone with <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charis.</hi>
Preſently ſhe put off her clothes, in ſaying the prayers that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
her, and when ſhe had nothing on but her ſmock with a cloke that
cover'd her, ſhe drew neare to the ciſterne, and from thence tooke water
three times, which ſhe ſprinckled about the chamber, then ſhe diſcover'd her
foot and legge naked, which ſhe put into the water of the bath. Then was
ſeene to be diſputed the whiteneſſe of that faire legge, with the whiteneſſe
of the marble: but the vivacitie which animated ſo delicate a fleſh, ſoone gave
the victory to her, and the marble ſeem'd to grow pale for being overcome.
<hi>Ariana</hi> had hid within the water that faire foot, whoſe little ſhape poſſeſt
ſuch perfection, and all her legge too; but preſently ſhe drew them out, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the water cold, and reſtor'd againe to the day that chiefe workmanſhip of
nature: Then having made the water luke-warme by meanes of the pipes, ſo
as ſhe might put her ſelfe therein with aſſurance, ſhe tooke off her ſmock in
feare, as much aſham'd to be naked, as if ſo many inanimate things had had
eyes, and going to put her ſelfe into the ciſterne, by chance ſhe caſt her eye
upon the great glaſſe, and was at firſt in a wonder, thinking ſhe ſaw there a
picture of <hi>Diana</hi> going into the bath, which ſhe had not before regarded: but
as ſoone perceiving her errour, ſhe was aſtoniſh't to ſee her ſelfe of ſo perfect
a handſomeneſſe. For whether ſhe conſider'd her face, or beauty, pleaſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that charmes hearts, and ſweet Majeſty had ſpent all their riches upon
her; or whether ſhee look'd upon the juſt length of that neck of ſnow, the
handſome proportion of it, and of thoſe two divine globes which ſeem'd to
be ſwel'd with nothing but pride to be ſo perfect, or whether ſhe ſtay'd to ſee
the beauty of her armes, and delicate hands, or the reſt of her body ſo well
proportioned, whoſe univerſall whiteneſſe dazel'd her very eyes, her mind
equally ſatisfied could not judge which part might give precedency to the
other. She was ſome while overjoyed to ſee her ſelfe ſo admirable, but ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
a ſhame came upon her, and accus'd her for commending her ſelfe ſo;
then the conſideration of that faire body, where ſhe found nothing amiſſe,
made her againe confident that ſhe was the handſomeſt woman in the world:
and preſently her modeſty withdrew her from ſo many pleaſures, cauſing her
to bluſh, ſo that ſhe was not able to reſolve of any thing for the ſeverall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of her mind. Happy thoſe mortall eyes, that with her ſee ſo many
marvells, and which are the longer bleſt, by theſe uncertainties of <hi>Ariana.</hi>
The love of her ſelfe and her modeſty were a long time diſputing together,
as ſhe ſtood before that mirrour, having already one foot upon the ciſterne,
and holding but with one arme the robe that before cover'd her: but at
length not able to determine if ſhe were fuller of ſatisfaction than ſhame, ſhe
went into the water, and there drown'd all theſe differences.</p>
               <p>When ſhe was at repoſe, diſcourſing with <hi>Epicharis</hi> of the rarities they
ſaw, ſhe was in a ſtrange wonder, that the windowes began to be more
<pb facs="tcp:7768:26"/>
obſcure, as if the heaven were prepar'd for a ſtorme: and ſuddenly they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
to fall upon them a ſweet raine of perfum'd waters. The admiration
that ſurpriz'd them, of an effect ſo ſtrange in a place that was cover'd, was
followed with a farre greater, when all at a time they ſaw the heaven, which
was repreſented over their heads, to open, and fill the Chamber full of lights.
By and by they heard a ſweet conſort of voyces that ſang <hi>Diana's</hi> praiſes, and
after them, they ſaw <hi>Diana</hi> her ſelfe by little and little to deſcend, having
her haire truſs'd up like a huntreſſe, a halfe Moone of Diamonds on her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
a robe of Azure girt under her boſome, that cover'd her but to the
knees, her legges and armes naked, her feet cover'd with guilt buſquins, her
quiver in a ſcarfe, and bow in her hand: when ſhe was at ground, the muſick
ceas'd, and the Goddeſſe approaching to <hi>Ariana</hi> that was confounded with
amazement, held her this diſcourſe: Faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> your devotion is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleaſing to me; I commend the pureneſſe of your ſoule, that could not
endure a ſimple reproach might fall on you, though in it ſelfe excuſable. And
this alſo is my will, that thoſe that adore me, bee not onely Virgins in deed
and thought, but that their vertue be alſo above the aſperſions of calumny.
Nevertheleſſe I forbid you ſo auſtere a vow; you are borne to be a wife, and
in that eſtate I ſhall ever love you, and make you happy, ſince I doe as much
affect chaſte marriages, as the vowes of perpetuall virginity. I have choſen
you a husband, that ſhall put you into the greateſt felicity the world can give,
I will have you love him, if you meane to make your ſelfe worthy the favours
I am to doe you. Farewell my dearely lov'd <hi>Ariana,</hi> I goe to ſend you meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
that ſhall prepare you, not to oppoſe my deſires. In ſaying theſe laſt
words ſhe kiſt her on the forehead, and preſently remounted up to the ſame
heaven ſhe came from.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariana</hi> was ſo troubled at theſe miracles, that ſhe could not anſwer ſo much
as one word, the preſence of a Divinity ſo great, her advice, and promiſes,
with the beleefe ſhe had the goddeſſe ſpake of <hi>Melintus,</hi> poſſeſt her ſoule,
and kept it from being at reſt. <hi>Epicharis</hi> was ſtanding in another place, farre
off <hi>Diana,</hi> out of reſpect, all in admiration, and immoveable. The heaven
clos'd, having receiv'd <hi>Diana,</hi> but open'd againe for the deſcent of ſix little
flying <hi>Cupids,</hi> who being ſuſtaind in the ayre, ſhot their arrowes into the
bath, and the arrowes entring into the water, ſet it on fire, and made light
flames come out of it. This fire frighted <hi>Ariana</hi> a little, but was no way of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive,
and a while after the <hi>Cupids</hi> flew backe againe into heaven. Then
beganne the heavenly muſicke againe, ſinging the good fortune of <hi>Ariana,</hi>
to be ſo favour'd of the Goddeſſe: And preſently <hi>Diana</hi> came downe the
ſecond time, bearing a man that had the appearance of a god, all glittering
in gold and precious ſtones. She came neare againe to <hi>Ariana,</hi> and ſaid, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<hi>Ariana,</hi> ſee here the husband I preſent you with; I know the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of your mind and wiſdome: you can never ſatisfie the generoſity which
the nobleneſſe of your blood gives you, but by the great honours and riches
he is poſſeſt of, nor ſee your owne vertue contented, but by that which ſhall
accompany him all his life long: Receive him from my hand, and be aſſur'd
that in obeying me, you ſhall in like manner enjoy the greateſt good fortune
that hath beene ever taſted upon earth. <hi>Ariana</hi> filled with a new amazement,
and ſeeing a goddeſſe whoſe brightneſſe and diſcourſe confounded her ſenſes,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7768:27"/>
never thought how ſhe was naked before a man: but when her ſight was
more confirm'd, and ſhe knew him to be <hi>Marcelin,</hi> ſhe then recover'd her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and having no reſpect to the Goddeſſe, ſhe came out of the water, putting
about her a great linnen cloth, and all wet as ſhe was hid her ſelfe in the bed,
ſo inwrapping her about, that ſhee could neither be ſeene nor touched. <hi>Diana</hi>
aſcended againe into heaven, and left that which remained, to be finiſhed by
<hi>Marcelin,</hi> who carefull of <hi>Ariana's</hi> health, before he ſpake any thing to her,
would have <hi>Epicharis</hi> dry her, and while ſhe was buſie at that office, he aboor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Miſtreſſe with theſe words: Why hide you your ſelfe from me, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Ariana?</hi> I am not ſo terrible: None in the world beſides you flyes from
me; I have Nobility and honours. Doe not deſpiſe me, faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> you
ſee that men and the gods conſpire to make me powerfull and happy. I am
lov'd not onely of the Emperour, but of the Divinity alſo you adore; how
ſhall you dare hereafter to addreſſe your prayers to her, if you refuſe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to her pleaſure? You know in what ſort ſhe approves the violent paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wherewith I love you: Abate, oh cruell one, the cruelty of your heart,
and render you, if not to the intreaties of men, yet at leaſt to the counſell of
the gods: can you thinke to doe amiſſe, following their advice, and hope to
live content upon the earth by not following them? The more <hi>Marcelin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
his diſcourſe, the more did ſhe hide her in the bed: but he ſeeing his
ſpeeches were to no purpoſe, went on ſpeaking for all that: Alas! <hi>Ariana,</hi>
I will not take advantage from the ſuccour of the gods, but be beholding for
all my fortune to your favour alone: give me but ſome hope to aſſwage the
ardent affection that torments me. After that, laying him downe upon the
bed, as dying for love, he ſaid, Helpe me, faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> and give me my life:
I dye to ſee you ſo hard-hearted, and am brought to this point, but for adoring
you with too much reſpect. But <hi>Ariana</hi> deafe to all thoſe ſupplications, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraind
him in the end to cry out, O gods! Oh <hi>Cupids!</hi> ayd mee, and ſuffer
me not to dye of the wound you your ſelves have given me. Then the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
open'd againe, and the ſix <hi>Cupids</hi> deſcended, and three of them ſtaid to
hold <hi>Epicharis,</hi> while the other three flew upon the bed, going to uncover
<hi>Ariana,</hi> and give her up to the power of <hi>Marcelin.</hi> This faire creature had no
recourſe but to her ſhriekings. Ah! yee gods, ſaid ſhee, are you acceſſary to
ſuch a wickedneſſe? ſhe defended her ſelfe as well as ſhe might from <hi>Marce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi>
attempts, labouring to teare his very face: but her forces had beene all
in vaine, the <hi>Cupids</hi> holding already her armes, had it not beene for <hi>Virginia<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
helpe, who open'd the Chamber doore, and came in with ſome other Maids
that had heard the voyce of <hi>Ariana</hi> and <hi>Epicharis</hi> crying out for helpe. She ran
inſtantly towards <hi>Marcelin,</hi> and ſtopping him, ſaid, Ha! the gods, what fury
is this? Is this the oath you ſware to me? Goe, out from hence, prophane
man, I renounce your friendſhip for ever. <hi>Marcelin</hi> anſwered the Prieſteſſe:
My deſigne being lawfull, and favoured of the gods, the effects of it could not
be criminall: but ſince you are a hinderance to me, let me returne to the gods,
that ſhall revenge my cauſe, and in ſpight of you give me <hi>Ariana.</hi> Then hee
went up againe into the heaven, which open'd as before time, and cloſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
In the meane time <hi>Ariana</hi> that thought ſhe had beene divinely ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured,
as ſhe was before divinely ſurpriſed, knew not what Deity to thank,
nor what to deteſt, ſeeing that <hi>Diana</hi> her ſelfe was a complice of the miſery

ſhe was upon the point to ſuffer: and all in confuſion, ſhe let her ſelfe
be dreſſed by <hi>Epicharis,</hi> and thoſe Maids whom ſhee conceiv'd to be ſo many
Nymphs, and made them many excuſes for enduring the honour they did
her. In the end ſhe gave them thanks for their helpe: and ſtill full of diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
ſhame, and deſpite, ſhe went out of the Temple to be in ſafety at <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
houſe, where ſhe preſently told her adventure to her brother and <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
Every one made thereupon differing judgements: <hi>Ariana</hi> was ſo prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
with thoſe deities and lights, that one while ſhe fear'd ſhee had offended
<hi>Diana,</hi> another while ſhe was fully reſolv'd not to obey her at all. <hi>Epicharis</hi>
perſwaded them, that <hi>Diana</hi> and all the marvels of heaven did never appeare
more viſibly to any, than they had done to them. <hi>Palamede</hi> beleev'd they had
not invented all thoſe particulars, and was amaz'd with them, at a thing ſo
extraordinary. But <hi>Melintus</hi> that was of a more piercing wit, and could not
imagine <hi>Diana</hi> was ſo carefull in <hi>Marcelins</hi> affaires, that was a Traytor, and
aſſaſinate, deſired them to beleeve, this was not the time of ſeeing deities
upon earth any more, and that there was ſome couzenage ſecretly practiſed
in it. <hi>Ariana</hi> reſiſted his reaſons a good while, ſaying ſhe was neither aſleepe
then, nor <hi>Epicharis;</hi> and that it was impoſſible any artifice could bee able to
ſuſtaine in the Ayre, without any ſupportation, a <hi>Diana</hi> and the <hi>Cupids:</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
ſhe waver'd betweene the aſſurance ſhe had in her eyes, and the
doubt <hi>Melintus</hi> conſiderations brought her to: but ſome dayes after ſhee was
fully perſwaded of the truth. It was found out that <hi>Virginia</hi> was ſiſter to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celin,</hi>
who being unable to approve either his wicked deſires, or his deſigne to
marry <hi>Ariana,</hi> though ſhe were very nobly borne, to the end hee might at
<hi>Rome</hi> match himſelfe into a Patrician family; and knowing the diſtaſte this
faire Maid had to her brother, was reſolv'd one day, as ſhee ſaw her in the
Temple, to diſcover the whole plot of <hi>Marcelin</hi> to her, that on her ſide ſhee
might find out ſome meanes to put him off his enterpriſe. Shee confeſt to
her, that the firſt time they ſpake together, <hi>Marcelin</hi> was in the Temple, and
that when ſhe was gone out, he came to know of her what <hi>Ariana</hi> had to ſay
to her, which ſhee preſently declar'd to him; whereupon hee muſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
then he deſir'd her to ſuffer him to ſee her in the bath: that, at firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhe told him it could not be done; but being overcome by his intreaties
and importunities, ſhe had in the end promis'd him: and the day after <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celin</hi>
having ſtudied upon that occaſion, came to find her, and propos'd how
<hi>Ariana</hi> might be deceiv'd, by repreſenting a falſe deity, that ſhould perſwade
her to love him. <hi>Virginia</hi> ſaid, that at the beginning ſhe approved not this
device, being unwilling the Temple ſhould be prophaned by a fraud: but
that he was ſo skilfull in conjuring her by repreſenting to her, to what extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
his paſſion was reduc'd, as at laſt ſhee permitted him to make ready all
his engines: and how to give him time ſhe had remitted <hi>Ariana</hi> to the eight
day after. Then ſhe told her, how her brother had dreſt the Chamber with
the riches that were his owne, and choſen an excellent Ingineere to ſet up
ſtately Theaters, and make all manner of repreſentations, and they together
had conſulted to take in the vault of that little Temple, and make a heaven of
it; that within it they had ſet a muſique with ſtore of Torches which made
that light, and that the darkneſſe was cauſed by meanes of certaine clothes
they had hung before the windowes, to make the place afterwards more
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7768:28"/>
lightſome by the torches. That the <hi>Diana</hi> was the moſt faire and famous
Comedian that was at that time in <hi>Rome;</hi> the children were alſo accuſtom'd
to the Theaters, and had their ſhafts rubbed with a compoſition that kindled
in water: that all this deſcended and aſcended by meanes of little wire threds
untwiſt and ſtrong, that were tied to their ſcarfes as it were inviſibly. <hi>Ariana</hi>
was full of wonder to heare of a deceit ſo well carried; but ſhe was as full of
ſhame when <hi>Virginia</hi> confeſt that <hi>Marcelin</hi> ſaw her when ſhe went into the
bath through holes he had made about the pipes of the ciſterne, and that ſhe
her ſelfe had beene curious to ſee ſo many beauties which ſhe proteſted ſhe
had never ſeene the like. After that ſhe aſſur'd her, that if ſhe had thought
her brother would have uſed violence, the entrance into the temple had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
beene permitted for his inventions. Whereupon ſhe ask'd her pardon,
for having expos'd her to that danger, being over-reach't by the prayers and
aſſurances her brother gave her. <hi>Ariana</hi> anſwer'd her, that ſhe wonder'd not
if ſhe had done ſome thing in favour of the friendſhip ſhe had to her brother,
and preſs'd by his importunities: that ſhe had a great obligation to her for
quitting the intereſts of a perſon ſo neere, to have care of hers, and for diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
this trick, that might have kept her in errour and trouble all her life.
They parted aſunder after ſome other diſcourſe, and <hi>Ariana</hi> went out of the
temple with an oath never more to ſeeke to purifie her ſelfe in <hi>Rome,</hi> where
chaſtity was ſubject to be corrupted by ſo many artifices. She confeſt to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi>
he had reaſon to ſuſpect ſome couzenage, and after ſhe had made this
relation, which he himſelfe found ſtrange, they gave their judgement how
they were to diſtruſt that man, who would never reſt there, ſince he ſought
out ſuch rare and powerfull practices.</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Marcelin</hi> perceiving his deſignes, either diſcover'd, or at
leaſt made unuſefull, was reſolv'd to demand <hi>Ariana</hi> in marriage of <hi>Ariſtides,</hi>
being in no hope otherwiſe to aſſwage his paſſion. He communicated his
purpoſe to <hi>Martian</hi> his father, and told him ſhe was daughter to <hi>Ariſtides</hi> one
of the chiefeſt men in <hi>Siracuſe,</hi> neece to <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> who was the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in that City, and had no children, and that they both drew their pedigree
from one of the moſt noble houſes in all <hi>Greece.</hi> His father would have put
him off this, becauſe ſhe was a ſtranger, but he could not doe it, what ever
remonſtrances he made him of the injury he did himſelfe, that might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to any of the nobieſt maids in <hi>Rome.</hi> In the end <hi>Martian</hi> that was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
accuſtomed to endure all the vitious paſſions of his ſonne, becauſe he was
of uſe to maintaine him with <hi>Nero,</hi> could well be pleas'd with this, that was
an honeſt one, and conſent to that he deſir'd. With this permiſſion <hi>Marcelin</hi>
addreſt himſelfe to <hi>Maximus,</hi> having thought him fit to mannage the
affaires, and declar'd his deſigne to him, back't with his fathers conſent, and
intreated him to make the propoſition of it to <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> of whom he hoped to
be receiv'd with contentment, being the ſonne of a Senator, if he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to leave his daughter at <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſe dwell there himſelfe, and in that
caſe, that he would obtaine for him the quality of a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> that
<hi>Palamede</hi> had obtain'd already: that if he had any familiarity with <hi>Ariana,</hi> he
beſought him alſo earneſtly to diſpoſe her to wiſh him well. <hi>Maximus</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of the quality of <hi>Marcelin,</hi> his credit and authority about the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
thought he might gaine a great ſupport to himſelfe, if he were able to
<pb facs="tcp:7768:28"/>
doe him any good office, and finding this propoſition honeſt, promis'd him
all the aſſiſtance he could expect.</p>
               <p>That very day he mov'd it to <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> who at the firſt could not conſent
to quit his daughter: Nevertheleſſe the greatneſſe of that party dazeling his
judgement, he began a little to give way to the reaſons of <hi>Maximus,</hi> and at
laſt promis'd to communicate the buſineſſe with his ſonne and daughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
that very houre he wrote of it into <hi>Sicily</hi> to his brother <hi>Dicearchus. Maximus</hi>
finding he was ſo fairely forward, advertis'd <hi>Marcelin</hi> of it, who ſeeing that
his good fortune partly depended on the good will of <hi>Ariana,</hi> fail'd not to
appeare at the Temple proudly cloth'd with a great traine, to make her ſee
what honour ſhe ſhould be miſtreſſe of, if ſhe conſented to his deſire, and
omitted not to make great expreſſions of his reſpect to her, ſerving himſelfe
at the ſame time, for divers ends, both with pompe, and with humility.</p>
               <p>On another ſide <hi>Ariſtides</hi> having made overture of it, to his children, <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
was in a great wonder to heare him mention it as a thing he deſired: Yet
ſhe continued mute to her fathers reaſons, and left the taking of her part to
her brother, who not enduring to have any thing more ſpoken concerning
a man he had ſo much cauſe to abhorre, and his ſiſter alſo for his ſake, was
forc'd to ſay, he beleev'd not that ſo good a father would marry his ſiſter to
a man that had twice attempted upon his life: that he could no longer hold
from confeſſing to him, that it was <hi>Marcelin</hi> that would have murther'd him
with a troupe of men, from which the gods only preſerv'd him: that after
that, feigning to ſend him an ointment for his wounds, he had ſent him poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
not ever thinking he was advertis'd, that he had beene the head of thoſe
that had aſſaulted him by night: that he had beene conſtrain'd to diſſemble
that treaſon, eſpecially knowing that the Emperour was of the party. But
what cauſe ſaid <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> had he to wiſh you ſo much evill? only for a falſe
report, anſwer'd <hi>Palamede. Ariſtides</hi> remain'd very much aſtoniſht at theſe
newes, and found himſelfe in a great ſtreight, ſeeing that if he had a deſire to
make that match, it would be very hard for him to ſatisfie his ſonnes ſpirit,
and if he would be excus'd for it to <hi>Maximus,</hi> he could not tell him the true
reaſons; having himſelfe approved <hi>Palamed's</hi> diſſimulation of the injury
offer'd him by <hi>Marcelin,</hi> for feare of making him an open enemy, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon himſelfe the diſpleaſure of the Emperour. So as he told his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that the matter well deſerv'd to be thought of at more leiſure. <hi>Ariana</hi>
when ſhe ſaw ſhe was ſtrengthned by <hi>Palamede,</hi> pray'd her father ſhe might
not be brought to that paſſe, to live with one that had ſpilt the bloud of her
brother, and had beene branded with ſo cowardly a treachery, as to venter his
poyſoning too. If this you allege, ſaid <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> be true, never will I bring
ſo much miſery upon my houſe. But take heed <hi>Palamede,</hi> that the feare of
leaving your ſiſter here, makes you coine theſe things, for I ſhould never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
you while I live if it were ſo. He is a party more exalted than we could
ever have hoped for, and that ſhall place your ſiſter in an illuſtrious
ranck, in the glory whereof you are to participate. It is not fitting, little
conſiderations ſhould turne you of this happineſſe, ſince it ſo fairely preſents
it ſelfe; we may very well quit all we have in <hi>Sicily,</hi> to dwell here in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
that may be envied of all our countrimen. Father, ſaid <hi>Palamede,</hi> I am
not an enemy to the honour and advancement of our houſe. I diſguiſe not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7768:29"/>
any thing to you; <hi>Melintus</hi> has beene too true a witneſſe of what I tell you,
and can certifie the truth: <hi>Ariſtides</hi> promis'd them to examine at leiſure all
thoſe reaſons, and to conſider what was to be done for their common good:
in the meane time he bade them thinke alſo upon the advantages that offer'd
themſelves, and not to neglect them. <hi>Palamede</hi> preſently acquainted <hi>Melintus</hi>
with this diſcourſe, and profeſt to him, he would oppoſe that marriage as
much as it were poſſible: <hi>Melintus</hi> ſet him on that way as much as he could,
and ſpake of it to <hi>Ariana</hi> to know her reſolution: but ſhe aſſur'd him ſhe
would ſooner marry with death. Nevertheleſſe, ſhe was greatly troubled,
when her father ſaid to her, that her brothers reaſons ought not to remove
them from accepting ſuch a party, that he knew but by light reports, that it
was he that would have murther'd him, and that it might be ſome one that
wiſht him ill, had ſent that ſame poyſon under <hi>Marcelin's</hi> name: That there
was no appearance he ſhould be authour of that villany, having beene twice
to viſit him ſince, with ſufficient teſtimonies of affection: and if that were
ſo, that the greateſt enemies might become friends; and that the deſigne he
had for her, as without all doubt it had extinguiſh'd his hatred, ſo ought it to
make that of <hi>Palamede</hi> dye alſo. <hi>Ariana</hi> ſaw well he was fully reſolv'd for that
marriage, and that it would be very difficult to divert him from it, which ſhe
tooke ſo impatiently, that ſhe curs't without ceaſing her voyage to <hi>Rome:</hi>
Nevertheleſſe, ſhe never dar'd to contradict her father openly; but then
when he commanded her to looke kindly upon <hi>Marcelin</hi> in what place ſoever
ſhe met him, ſhe began to deſpaire, not knowing how ſhe might avoyd that
misfortune, becauſe ſhe could not expreſſe her averſeneſſe to <hi>Marcelin,
Ariſtides</hi> ever accompanying her to the temple to ſee what reception ſhe
gave him. <hi>Melintus</hi> trouble was no leſſe, not knowing what remedy to find
out, and if his wit furniſh'd him of any one, he could not make it proſper,
but that his paſſion ſhould breake out. <hi>Palamede</hi> ſeemed the moſt offended,
and more openly expreſt his diſpleaſure. <hi>Ariana</hi> knew well enough, her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would not compell her, if ſhe declar'd her minde abſolutely to him; but
her modeſty would not permit her ſo much liberty.</p>
               <p>At length <hi>Dice<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rchus</hi> letters came, who being naturally ambitious, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
to get himſelfe ſupport in <hi>Rome,</hi> intreated his brother not to let ſcape
ſo great a good fortune, and no more to thinke of <hi>Diocles</hi> riches, whoſe ſonne
he had deſtin'd his daughter to; ſince the leaſt quality of a Roman Senator
was of greater conſideration than all the meanes of the moſt puiſſant man in a
province. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> heartned by this counſell, commanded <hi>Ariana</hi> to prepare
her to receive <hi>Marcelin</hi> the day after. This newes ſo ſtrucke her, that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
her to her bed, and the paleneſſe of her face ſoone ſhewed what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
ſhe reſented. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> wondering at her ſickneſſe, ſhe told him it
was no great matter, and beſought him he would deferre but one day this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview:
which he granted her, and in the meane time ceas'd not to be with
her to encourage her with reaſons, and make her conſent to the match. But
the morning after, conſidering on the wayes to divert <hi>Marcelin,</hi> and finding
none other but to let him know her diſtate, ſhe bethought her of this ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>Epicharis</hi> whom ſhe had about her, was a young maide about her age,
that was very faithfull to her of a gentile ſpirit, and who being acquainted
with her miſtreſſes diſpleaſures, would have willingly comforted her with
<pb facs="tcp:7768:29"/>
the loſſe of her owne life. Thou knoweſt, ſayes <hi>Ariana</hi> to her, how it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for me to tell my mind to <hi>Marcelin,</hi> for that my father will ever be a
witneſſe of the uſage I give him. I prethee, whileſt <hi>Ariſtides</hi> ſhall be about my
bed, put on my ordinary gowne, and covering thee with the g<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eat ſcarffe I
uſe to weare, goe thy wayes to the Temple, where <hi>Marcelin</hi> will not faile to
come to thee: thou maiſt tell him in a low voyce, counterfetting mine, that
he loſes all hope of marrying me, that I will rather chuſe to dye, what ever
guiſe I make before my father, and if of his owne accord he will retire him
from his ſute, without bringing me to the extremity, I ſhall have a great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to him for it. <hi>Epicharis</hi> very glad to ſerve <hi>Ariana,</hi> promis'd to obey
her, and after ſhe had diſguis'd her ſelfe, went to the Temple, where ſhe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
not to ſpeake with <hi>Marcelin:</hi> and at her returne finding <hi>Ariana</hi> impatient
to know what had paſs'd, ſhe told her he had beene abus'd very pleaſantly:
Nevertheleſſe, her diſcourſe having amazed him, he had not omitted to aske
her leave to come to ſee her at home, as it was appointed; after that he would
conſider on the meanes to obey her, if her rigour ſhould continue. She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
her therefore againſt that day, and in the meane time the thoughts in
that houſe were very divers. <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> meditated upon cruell
tragedies, rather than they would conſent this wretched man ſhould enjoy
<hi>Ariana. Maximus</hi> never ceas'd repreſenting the grandeurs of the houſe of
<hi>Martian,</hi> the favour of <hi>Marcelin</hi> with <hi>Nero,</hi> and within his minde conceiv'd
faire hopes for the good office he rendred him. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> beleev'd already he
ſaw his daughter wife to a Roman Senatour, equalling the pompe and glory
of the chiefeſt of the Empire. But <hi>Ariana</hi> would not let her ſelfe be wonne
by theſe vanities, and more prized the leaſt of <hi>Melintus</hi> qualities, than all thoſe
honours that were accompanied with ſo many miſeries: ſhe therefore dream'd
onely of the meanes that were capable to breake off this blow. At laſt the day
came that <hi>Marcelin</hi> was to come to the houſe, where <hi>Maximus</hi> did what hee
could to receive a perſon of ſo great worth, and prepar'd the reſt to give him
the honours were worthy his order. They dined altogether with much ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
every one meditating apart the deſignes he had in his mind; then they
return'd into the Chamber where they muſt receive this lover. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> a
while entertain'd his daughter with the diſcourſes ſhee was to make him,
wherein ſhe was not reſolute to ſatisfie him altogether: then he gave <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
his place to ſet upon her with the ſame perſwaſions, and went to finde
<hi>Palamede</hi> to diſpoſe him to ſhew a well pleas'd countenance. They were all
thus buſied, attending <hi>Marcelin</hi> that was ſomething tedious. <hi>Palamede</hi> ſaid it
became the Roman gravity to be waited for. Some houres paſſe away more;
at laſt, <hi>Maximus</hi> impatient that he came not, ſent to <hi>Martian's</hi> houſe; who
ſent word, that he had not ſeene his ſonne ſince the day before, and that he
was in paine for him. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> begins to wonder at this humour in <hi>Marcelin,</hi>
to neglect a thing he had before ſo much ſought for. Yet for all that they
could heare no newes of him; every one thereupon gave his different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
but not one of them could gheſſe the cauſe of that action. <hi>Marcelin</hi>'s
people appear'd to be in great trouble for him, and one of them ſaid, that the
night before he had accompanied him very neere to the Tyber, that there
he had commanded him to returne home, and how he knew not but he might
be drown'd in the darkneſſe of the night. His fathers feare thereupon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7768:30"/>
and all the day after paſt alſo, and no body could learne what ſhould
be become of him. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> had a ſuſpition that his ſonne willing to hinder
the marriage, and revenge himſelfe, had handled him the night paſt in the
ſame manner he had beene us'd by him when he was left for dead, and made
him be caſt into the Tyber: yet he durſt not ſignifie to him any thing of
this ſurmiſe.</p>
               <p>About the evening <hi>Melintus, Palamede, Ariana,</hi> and <hi>Epicharis</hi> being toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and not knowing to what they might impute the cauſe of <hi>Marcelin's</hi>
abſence; What may we thinke, ſaid <hi>Ariana,</hi> is become of him? For mee,
ſayes <hi>Melintus,</hi> I thinke in what place ſoever he be, he burnes for love of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana.</hi>
It ſuffices me, ſayes <hi>Palamede,</hi> he be drown'd. It ſeemes, replied <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
you know ſomething of the matter? have you indeed ſerv'd him as hee
would have ſerv'd you? They proteſted both, they had not imagin'd to doe
him any harme. Tis true, ſayes <hi>Palamede,</hi> that before hee had married you,
ſome thing like this might have befallen him; but I thought not it had beene
time yet for that. <hi>Ariana</hi> added, let him be drown'd, or burn'd, or let the
earth have ſwallowed him, it little concernes me, provided hee appeares no
more. <hi>Epicharis</hi> having ſome while hearkned to them, could not refraine
from telling them; I am aſſur'd I can gheſſe better than you all three. And
what thinkſt thou, ſaid <hi>Ariana,</hi> is become of him? I imagine, anſwer'd ſhe,
that he is neither burn'd, nor ſwallowed up, nor drown'd: but that at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
he is dying for hunger. <hi>Ariana</hi> thinking ſhe had but jeſted; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ground you, ſayes ſhe, that beleefe? rather call it, ſayes ſhe, aſſurance:
If you will give him any thing to eat, I will bring you to the place where he
has as much need of it, as ever he had in his life. <hi>Ariana</hi> urg'd her to tell her
what ſhe knew. I feare, ſayes ſhe, you three will be more gentle than I: for
I have condemn'd him to dye, and if I diſcover to you in what manner, it
may be you will preſerve his life, to deſtroy afterwards your owne. That
made them the more eager to know what ſhe could ſay of the matter: and
they ſo preſt her, that at length ſhe told them: You know that at the end of
the garden of this houſe, in a place remote enough, there ſtands a little lodge
neare to the gate opens upon the Tyber. <hi>Marcelin</hi> waits for <hi>Ariana</hi> in that
place ſince before yeſternight, and I can aſſure you, that never lover was ſo
impatient of ſeeing his Miſtreſſe. They were ſo aſtoniſh'd at this newes,
that ſome while they ſpake not a word: But <hi>Ariana</hi> deſirous to know how
ſhe had beene able to draw him to that place; You know, ſaid <hi>Epicharis,</hi> you
commanded me to goe to the Temple in your habit and vaile, which I did;
and <hi>Marcelin</hi> ſcarce daring to come neare me, I lift up my veile a little, ſo as
he could not ſee me, and made him a ſigne with my hand to come to mee;
but in ſtead of ſaying to him that you commanded me to ſay, I began thus,
ſpeaking very low: <hi>Marcelin,</hi> hitherto I have profeſt to you nothing but
coldneſſe, not but that I acknowledg'd the honour you doe me, but in ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to a brother that cannot love you, and will never give his conſent I
be yours: wherefore I will make to appeare the affection I beare you; and
you ſhall expreſſe yours to me, if this night you come alone to our houſe by
the gate that lookes to the Tyber; there you ſhall receive aſſurances of what
I would doe for you; and I will make my brother reſolve to conſent to my
deſire, when I ſhall let him ſee that you are already my husband. <hi>Marcelin</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7768:30"/>
gave me a thouſand thanks for ſo many graces, and promis'd me not to faile
comming thither at the houre I had appointed him. I came backe from the
Temple, and would not tell you what I had done; yea, I fear'd mee leſt hee
might doubt ſome malice, and not come; but at night ſtealing from you,
I went to ſtay for him at that ſame gate, where I miſs'd not to finde him; and
after I had let him in, I told him, I had charge from <hi>Ariana</hi> to put him into
that lodge, while her father, and the reſt were aſleepe, where I ſo well ſhut
him up, that he never got out ſince: beſides I tooke the key of the garden
for feare any one going by that way ſhould heare him crie out, and I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to let him die there for hunger to make him pay for the conzening
villanous tricks he had wrought in the temple, and deliver you out of all paine,
which I thinke you are to reſolve on too; for this man will be a cauſe of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
misfortunes to you in the end, and you may revenge you all three of
the miſchiefs he hath done you, it will be eaſie for us afterwards to caſt him
into the Tiber, and never ſhall any one know who it was that us'd him ſo, if
ſome of us doe not diſcover it. They were amaz'd at her invention, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her boldneſſe, and the ſimplicity of <hi>Marcelin,</hi> but at length they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
too much rigour. Now ſaid <hi>Epicharis,</hi> you may doe with him what you
pleaſe; I have done the ſervice which I ought to my miſtreſſe, and to you,
and at the leaſt, I have broken that blow you ſo much apprehended. Then
they were in a great trouble to let <hi>Marcelin</hi> get out, and withall to content
him, being not willing to have him loſt, and fearing alſo his fury, when he
ſhould have eſcaped. I perceive well, ſaid <hi>Epicharis,</hi> I muſt ſave you from the
danger I have put you to, and take all the envy upon my ſelfe, ſeing you are
pleas'd he ſhould live. Let me goe then I will make up the matter well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and make him ſuſpect no body but my ſelfe, and never vex you more.
<hi>Melintus</hi> was of opinion they ſhould leave to her the ordering of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
becauſe ſhe was of a moſt advis'd wit, and ſhe went that very houre to
the lodge where having open'd the doore to <hi>Marcelin,</hi> and then conducted
him out of the houſe all pale and feeble for his faſtings, holding the gate
halfe open, ſhe ſaid to him, know that it is <hi>Ariana</hi> that gives you your life,
and that it is I alone that reſolved to take it from you, for all the trouble you
have put her to by your wooing. She was determin'd rather to dye, than
marry you, and I had much rather you ſhould have dyed, than ſhe: for it
was I that ſpake to you under the vaile without her knowledge of it and
gave you the appointment to which you ſo eaſily render'd your ſelfe: my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
was never to have fetch'd you from hence: but when I made her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with my plot, ſhe was willing to pardon you, upon charge you
would never more importune her; which you are to doe, if you love your
life: for aſſure you ſelfe, I ſhall want neither invention nor courage to deſtroy
you, if you chance ever more to torment her. <hi>Marcelin</hi> full of wonder and
weakneſſe, having let her ſpeake a while, fail'd not to enter into a fury againſt
this maide, and would willingly have torne out her eyes, and life alſo, if he
had had more ſtrength to ſhuffe ope the doore: but ſhe ſhut it with violence,
leaving him without all in a rage, and came to advertize <hi>Ariana</hi> what ſhe had
done; that ſhe ſhould never have any diſpleaſure on that ſide; and that all
the hate was fallen upon her, which ſhe very little regarded. <hi>Palamede</hi> and
<hi>Melintus</hi> ſaw well they were warranted from the ſearch of <hi>Marcelin,</hi> but
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7768:31"/>
not yet from his fury, ſuſpecting well he was gone out from thence with as
great a deſire of revenge, as hunger. Nevertheleſſe the preſent miſchiefe,
being avoyded, they ought to keepe themſelves to their guards for the time
to come. The day after they knew he was return'd to his houſe; but when
he was ask'd what voyage he had made in three dayes ſpace, he anſwer'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
ſo much aſham'd was he to have beene ſo cruelly deceiv'd by a wench.
<hi>Ariſtides</hi> nor <hi>Maximus</hi> heard not a word more from him, for all his wits were
employed in meditating what ſuddaine and cruell vengeance, he might take
of all thoſe ſtrangers, before they return'd into <hi>Sicily.</hi>

and knowing his ſickneſſe was but a pretext for not viſiting
her, began to have a ſenſe of her misfortune, and that he had
not enterpris'd his ſute to her, but in favour of the ſearch of
<hi>Palamede:</hi> her affection ungratefully acknowledged, her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
contemn'd, ſo many commendable qualities neglected, and all her carefull
aſſiſtances quite forgot, aſſailed her ſpirit with ſo much anguiſh, deſpite and
ſhame, that ſhe was not able to make reſiſtance to them. The faigned ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of <hi>Melintus</hi> cauſed in her a true one, and the newes came to <hi>Maximus</hi> his
houſe, that ſhe was at the extremity, and a few dayes after that ſhe was dead.
<hi>Palamede</hi> would have gone to viſit <hi>Camilla</hi> to comfort her, but that <hi>Melintus,</hi>
who was in ſorrow for this accident, diverted him, for feare he ſhould engage
himſelfe againe with her, and ſo bring a ſtay to the deſigne they had of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting,
and he promis'd him to ſatisfie this duty to <hi>Camilla</hi> for them both
ſome dayes after.</p>
               <p>But as they did innocently bring misfortune upon others, ſo were others
prepar'd to make their innocency moſt unfortunate. <hi>Marcelin</hi> not willing to
let them be gone without cauſing them to feele the effects of his rage, began
to vant before <hi>Nero</hi> the beauty of <hi>Ariana,</hi> and ſpake ſo many marvells of it,
that he produc'd in him a deſire to ſee her; then having let him know ſhee
was of an humour too retentive to give up her ſelfe to the Emperour, and
ſerve his pleaſures: on the other ſide that ſhe never went abroad, and how it
would be a hard matter to take her away, he made him the more deſirous by
theſe difficulties to have the poſſeſſion of this faire creature: but when he told
him ſhe was ſiſter to <hi>Palamede,</hi> and that they were logded together with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi>
the Emperour remembers him of the cauſe he had to be revenged of
thoſe two friends, for the offence he thought he had taken of <hi>Melintus,</hi> and
the wound he had the night of the combat, the marke whereof was yet to be
ſeene upon his hand. <hi>Marcelin</hi> ſeeing the Prince in thoſe reſſentments, told
him, how he had found out an excellent meanes to revenge him on <hi>Melintus</hi>
and <hi>Palamede,</hi> and to have <hi>Ariana</hi> to the bargaine. He added that they were
that very night to ſet fire on all ſides of the houſe they were in, and when
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7768:32"/>
they ſhould thinke of eſcaping, without dreaming of any thing beſides ſaving
them from the flame, it would be eaſie to put them to the ſword in the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult,
and to raviſh <hi>Ariana. Nero</hi> that affected nothing ſo much as ſuch furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
inventions, entertain'd this with joy, and commended <hi>Marcelin</hi> highly
for it, who that very houre tooke the charge to diſpoſe his men about the
houſe, that not one of them might eſcape. This reſolution was very funeſt
to the City of <hi>Rome:</hi> for the night being come, when he thought every one
was drowned in ſleepe, he himſelfe holding a Torch in his hand, ſet it under
<hi>Maximus</hi> doore, and gave example to the reſt to doe the like every where
elſe. Preſently the fire kindled with ſuch violence at that houſe, and in order
at the other houſes of the ſtreet, that hee beleev'd never any of them could
get out from thence, but that they ſhould be all burn'd. And indeed when
they awaked, all the Chambers were of a ſmoake; all that they were to doe,
was to get out with their clothes, which they haſtily tooke, and ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the garden, expecting the remedy that might be given to this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
<hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Melintus</hi> tooke care to lead <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and the faire <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi>
who in this fray let <hi>Melintus</hi> ſee beauties which his imagination could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have ſo perfectly repreſented to him. The little <hi>Damis,</hi> a young ſlave of
<hi>Maximus,</hi> came to advertiſe his Maſter that was in their company, that loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
out at a window he had perceiv'd a man that held a Torch in his hand,
and ſet fire to one ſide of the houſe: that made them doubt of Treaſon; and
they had beſides greater aſſurance of it, when upon the Tibers ſide they heard
two ſlaves of <hi>Maximus</hi> crying out as they were killed, who were gone out to
fetch water at the River. <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> iſſued out to ſuccour them,
but they were aſſaulted by ten or twelve Souldiers, with ſuch fury, that the
beſt courſe they could take, was to retire into the houſe againe, defending
themſelves as they went<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> thought there was none but <hi>Marcelin</hi> could
be Author of ſo fearefull a villany: and could not tell what they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
on, ſeeing they were environed with fires on all ſides, and a certaine
death, whether they ſtayed there, or whether they went out: He look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Ariana,</hi> the teares in his eyes, and ſtrucke with griefe that ſo excellent a
beauty ſhould dye ſo cruell a death, came ſadly to her, and ſaid; Madam, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
what miſery are we brought? and how have the heavens permitted, that
all the furies together ſhould come to aſſaile us, to make our loſſe inevitable?
Is it poſſible that I cannot by ſome enterpriſe, or yet by my owne ruine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
your life? And can I not have at leaſt this joy in dying, to ſee you out
of danger? <hi>Melintus,</hi> anſwered ſhe, doe not hope from me either counſell or
conſolation: this accident ſo troubles me, that it leaves me nothing but teares
and plaints; but if it be true that <hi>Marcelin</hi> bee chiefe of this conſpiracy, I
had much rather dye with you, than ſurvive and fall into his hands. Seeing
the gods have ſuffered this miſ-fortune to come to paſſe, I beſeech them it
may have his full courſe, rather than that I be reſerv'd to live after you, to
be expos'd to the inſolence of theſe deſperate people. Madam, replide hee, I
cannot beleeve we are ordain'd to an end ſo miſerable; and though the fire
on all ſides ſeemes to ſhut up the paſſage to all hope, the way of heaven, from
whence ſuccours may be ſent us, is yet free. Let us yet hope, Madam, and
moderate your weepings and complaints; whileſt I goe to ſee by what means
we may be ſaved, and whether ſome god may not inſpire me what we are to
<pb facs="tcp:7768:32"/>
doe in this extremity. She anſwered him not but with a ſigh, and <hi>Melintus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
kiſt her hand, left her, hiding his teares as well as hee could, then hee
look'd round on all ſides, and after having ſearch'd in vaine a thouſand inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in his wits, at laſt paſſing by the Stable, he adviſed with himſelfe to get
up upon the ſtrongeſt and fleeteſt of his horſes. He advertis'd alſo <hi>Palamede</hi>
and the reſt to take what horſes there were, and after having covered <hi>Ariana's</hi>
head with a cloth, for feare the fire might offend her, he lift her gently into
his armes, and making the gates be open'd, tooke his ſword in his hand. Then
putting ſpurres to his horſe, he went furiouſly away, and after he had ſtruck
off the arme of a Souldier that would have got hold of his bridle, hee ſaved
himſelfe by running, carrying away his deare <hi>Ariana</hi> through the thickeſt of
armed men, and flames that already devour'd the neighbour houſes. <hi>Marcelin</hi>
ſeeing <hi>Melintus</hi> paſſe that held <hi>Ariana,</hi> and that he was not able to ſtay him,
although he had caſt himſelfe in the way before him, and encourag'd the reſt
to kill him, was now in deſpaire ſeeing himſelfe on foot not able to overtake
him: and as he return'd, he ſaw <hi>Palamede</hi> his principall enemy, who after
<hi>Melintus</hi> example would have got away, carrying his father with him; but
they ſo cloſed themſelves together to hinder him, that <hi>Palamede</hi> ſeeing how
it was impoſſible for him to force them, being loaden with his fathers heavy
body, entered in againe and gave <hi>Ariſtides</hi> to <hi>Hermes,</hi> one of his men; then
having carefully recommended to <hi>Arcas</hi> the ſafety of <hi>Epicharis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> he gave them
charge to follow him as ſoone as hee ſhould have made a paſſage with his
ſword. He tooke a buckler, and going out againe, ſet upon the boldeſt of
them that would have ſtayed him, and charg'd them with ſuch fury, that
with two blowes he gave, he ſtrucke downe two of them at his feet; the reſt
ſuſtain'd him with much reſolution, and he had much adoe to ward all their
blowes; but in the end mingling him amongſt them, he put them in ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
as he gave time to <hi>Hermes</hi> to get away and ſave <hi>Ariſtides; Arcas</hi> did
likewiſe beare away <hi>Epicharis,</hi> and the others taking the reſt of the horſes,
ſaved with them that that was moſt precious. <hi>Palamede</hi> ſeeing they were
farre enough off now, diſpatch'd him of his enemies, and went away in a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop
after them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcelin</hi> inraged to ſee his wicked deſignes thus ruin'd, ſtrucke his owne
men alſo, accuſing them of cowardiſe, and ſeeing a ſlave of <hi>Ariſtides</hi> paſſing,
that went away later than the reſt, getting at laſt a horſe with much adoe, he
gave him a blow on the head with his ſword, &amp; laid him dead upon the place.
Then mounting a horſe-backe upon his owne horſe, he purſues thoſe that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
themſelves, and gave order to his companions to find horſes, and come
preſently after him to ayd him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> finding no ſecurity in the City which he ſaw all on fire, and full
of his enemies, was got out of the ports, and when he was in plaine Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian,
he could not complaine at this accident that gave him the favour of da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to embrace his faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> who did as ſweetly cleave cloſe to him for
feare of falling. She was become ſo dazled with the ſwiftneſſe of the courſe,
that <hi>Melintus</hi> after he had put his ſword into the ſcabberd, and taken away the
cloth that covered her head, found her ſeeming to have loſt all remembrance;
but conſidering how this happened but by aſtoniſhment, and ſeeing her
faire necke bare, becauſe the handkercher that covered it was fallen by the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7768:33"/>
violent motion, he uſed nothing to make her come againe to her ſelfe, beſides
ſweet and chaſte kiſſes which he gave, one while to this admirable neck, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to her diuine eyes, and ſweet mouth. He was tranſported in theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
then full of reſpect, he accus'd himſelfe of raſhneſſe, to ſteale the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
which at another time he would ſcarce preſume to conceive a deſire
of: and preſently before he could reſolve whether he had done amiſſe or no,
carried away by the power of thoſe admirable objects, he kiſt them againe
with ſo much raviſhment, that in this eſtate the loſſe of his judgement excus'd
the loſſe of his reſpect, and his ſenſes buſied about ſo pleaſing a fault, mocked
at his reaſon, whoſe ſeverity alſo being charmed gave conſent to their thefts,
and refus'd not to take part in their delights.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariana</hi> after a great ſigh at laſt opening her eyes, with one looke only ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
all the liberties of <hi>Melintus,</hi> and remitted in place of them a reſpect as
great as ever: then ſhe ſaid to him; Alas, <hi>Melintus,</hi> where are wee? Wee
are, anſwers he, in ſafety: I am only in paine for <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Palamede,</hi> and
but that I am afraid to forſake you, I would returne to helpe them. As he
was thus ſpeaking he perceiv'd by the light of the moone and flames, a
man running after him whom he tooke to be one of their troupe. So as
alighting from his horſe, and ſetting upon the greene graſſe the ſweet
charge he carried, he prayed her to reſt her, while the reſt of the company
were come together. They began to behold that great City on fire, and to
be amaz'd at the accident, when ſeeing to approach him that followed them,
<hi>Melintus</hi> knew him to be <hi>Marcelin:</hi> ſuddainly getting up a horſe-back for
feare of being ſurpris'd which his enemy. Ah traitor! ſayes he, dareſt thou
at length alone aſſault me? <hi>Marcelin</hi> not anſwering him at all, came ſtraight
towards him, and gave him a blow with his ſword; <hi>Melintus</hi> avoyded it, giving
ſpurs to his horſe, and ſoone gaining the crouper, thought to have ſtruck
his ſword into the very reines of <hi>Marcelin,</hi> but it brake having met with armes
under his caſack. I was in a great wonder, ſaid he then, at thy valour, but
this ſhall not hinder, but thou ſhalt pay for thy trecheries: and ſeeing that
<hi>Marcelin</hi> could not mannage his horſe after his minde, he ſet foot to ground,
and at the ſame inſtant leaping up behind him got hold of his armes with one
of his, and with the other was going to ſtrike into his head, that which was
left of his ſword: But <hi>Marcelin</hi> ſtriving hard, <hi>Melintus</hi> was forc'd to let him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſlide downe in pulling him back-ward, and having laid him along upon
the ground, ſnatch'd from him his ſword: He was about to kill him, but at
the very inſtant he heard <hi>Ariana</hi> crying out to him for helpe.</p>
               <p>This ſweet Lady had ſeene the beginning of that combat, being but in a
deſperate condition, yet although ſhe judged that if <hi>Marcelin</hi> remain'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
ſhe ſhould fall into his hands, nevertheleſſe being confident in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
valour, ſhe could not reſolve of going farre away. But when ſhe ſaw his
ſword broke, ſhe fell downe in a ſoune, and was no ſooner come to her ſelfe
againe, but ſhe ſaw ſhe was in the armes of a ſouldier that was alighted from
his horſe to carry her away. Then was it that ſhe call'd <hi>Melintus,</hi> and this
name that demanded ſuccours was at the ſame time ſuccourable; for that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
looking where ſhe was, ſaw behinde him two men a horſe-back that
were about to kill him. He lift up himſelfe ſuddainly and ſuſtain'd the firſt
with <hi>Marcelin's</hi> ſword in one hand, and the reſt of his owne in the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7768:33"/>
Never had man ſo much choler and griefe together. He deſir'd to defend
him from theſe, and at the ſame time to helpe <hi>Ariana;</hi> but ſeeing he could
not ſave her, but by the death of thoſe that ſet upon him, he gave one of
them ſuch a blow, that if he had not beene armed, he had divided his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the body; and yet the ſword entred a good way into the coat of
armes. The ſecond came up to him, and thought to have ſtab'd him into the
belly, but <hi>Melintuus</hi> defended it with the guard he had in his left hand, and at
the ſame time gave him a blow under the curaſſe, which made him fall dead
from his horſe. He that had beene firſt ſtruck by him, ſet on him behind, and
<hi>Melintus</hi> was not ſo skilfull, but that he was a little hurt in the ſhoulder; but
in turning about, he gave a reverſe blow upon the horſes head, and making
him caper, he tooke his time, and thruſt his ſword under the thigh of this
laſt man, and plung'd it even into his bowels: This wretch falling back-ward
brake his neck, and the fall ſtop'd his breath which now on all ſides drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
away with his bloud.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> ſeeing himſelfe freed of theſe two men, and having about him
none but <hi>Marcelin</hi> living, which had much adoe to returne from the dazeling
of his fall, left off finiſhing his death, to run towards <hi>Ariana,</hi> who had till
then hindred by a thouſand devices, this ſouldiour from ſetting her upon his
horſe to carry her away. <hi>Melintus</hi> cryed out to him afarre off, Inſolent fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
wilt thou let alone that Lady thou art unworthy to touch? But he
ſeeing him comming, and willing to prevent him, left <hi>Ariana</hi> to get up a
horſe-back, and preſently ſetting ſpurres pricked towards him thinking to
overthrow him. <hi>Melintus</hi> lightly turned him aſide, and as he paſſed ſtruck
him on the left arme with ſo great a wound, that he filled with bloud all the
place where about he ran.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time <hi>Marcelin</hi> recovering force and courage, lift himſelfe up,
and taking one of the dead mens ſwords, came to ſecond him that <hi>Melintus</hi>
hard hurt, and rather filled with rage, than reſolution raſh't him upon him.
<hi>Melintus</hi> husbanding the forces and advantage he had, after warding of two
or three blowes, gave him one in the thigh, and went to redouble it, when
he that had beene hurt, came to put himſelfe betweene for the ſafety of his
Maſters life: but he paid his owne for it, receiving the blow which <hi>Melintus</hi>
ſtruck ſo deepe in that he clos'd up his ſword within his armes. This man dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
let go the reines of his horſe that ran away, &amp; <hi>Melintus</hi> unwilling to let his
ſword goe ſo followes him, and at laſt drew it out with paine, and with that
violence, and the amazedneſſe wherein he was, he fell back-wards.</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Marcelin</hi> that felt his ſtrength diminiſh, ſeeing <hi>Ariana</hi>
ſtanding ſtill, and troubled with ſo many fears, went towards her, his ſword in
his hand for to kill her, to the end that if he dyed, another ſhould not enjoy
his loves. The comming of this furious man, and brightneſſe of the ſword
awakened the loſt ſenſes of <hi>Ariana,</hi> and gave her wings to run to <hi>Melintus,</hi>
whom ſhe call'd to her aide, and it was juſt then he was fallen, and <hi>Marcelin</hi>
was in good hope to vanquiſh him yet, thinking he was hurt: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
<hi>Melintus</hi> prepar'd himſelfe getting up, and then they began the combat
hand to hand, and more equall, though <hi>Marcelin</hi> were arm'd, becauſe the
bloud that ran out of his wound leſſened that advantage.</p>
               <p>Untill then <hi>Melintus</hi> had not fought but for ſaving his owne life, but now
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7768:34"/>
he reveng'd the injuries of <hi>Ariana,</hi> and that deſire encouraging him, with the
preſence of his faire Miſtreſſe, he made account he ſhould ſoone ſee an end
of that adventure: ſo having warded ſome thruſts of <hi>Marcelins,</hi> he with one
blow from all the force he had, overthrew him, and therewith cleft his head.
Another Souldier came on running in all ſpeed, and <hi>Melintus</hi> wearied with
ſo many travels, thought this combat would never have end, and hee ſhould
have enough to do to defend him from al thoſe that came ſo thick upon him;
yet he was reſolv'd to ſtay for him; but this laſt man ſeeing his courage, and
ſo many dead about him, ran away as faſt as he came, and at the ſame time
freed <hi>Melintus</hi> of ſo many troubles, and <hi>Ariana</hi> of all her apprehenſions. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
would no more ſtrike <hi>Marcelin,</hi> ſeeing he made no ſigne of life, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the gods thankes for this victory, wiped <hi>Marcelins</hi> ſword, and taking the
ſcabberd, wore it by his ſide.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Ariana</hi> breathing at her eaſe, conſider'd <hi>Melintus,</hi> and admir'd him,
that after having runne ſo many dangers, and acquir'd ſo much glory, hee
appear'd with a confidence ſo modeſt, and a face untroubled for any amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But all on the ſudden ſhe ſaw him grow pale, and fearing hee might
have ſome deadly hurt, for he was cover'd all over with bloud, ſhee held him
up, and ask'd him if he felt no wound about him. Madam, ſayes hee, feare
not for ſeeing me all bloody, it is not mine, but the blood of my enemies;
yet for all this, as he was ſpeaking he found himſelfe to faint, and with <hi>Ariana's</hi>
helpe he layd him ſoftly downe upon the ground.</p>
               <p>The blood that ran from <hi>Melintus</hi> ſhoulder, made the blood retire out of
the cheekes of <hi>Ariana,</hi> who full of feare and care, preſently undreſt him in
that place, and found a wound that for the ſmalneſſe of it caſt out blood ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient:
ſhee tore her handkercher, and with much adoe ſtayed the
courſe of it; then ſhee ſo bound it up, as there was no more cauſe to feare.</p>
               <p>While ſhee was buſie at this ſad duty, which <hi>Melintus</hi> with all reſpect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
at her hands, they heard the noyſe of horſes, and turning their heads,
ſaw ten or twelve horſemen comming ſtill towards them. <hi>Melintus</hi> without
being aſtoniſh'd, ſaid to her; Madam, leave this unprofitable care, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I am unworthy; I ſee there is no remedy but I muſt dye, but yet I will that
it be in defending you to the laſt breath. Onely, Madam, remember your
ſelfe. There his ſpeech fail'd him, not knowing how he might diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
<hi>Ariana</hi> lively touch'd at ſo reſpectuous a paſſion, and unable to reſiſt ſo
ſenſible ſtroaks of misfortune, fainted for griefe, and after ſhee had ſaid, Ah
<hi>Melintus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> loſt both her ſpeech and ſight.</p>
               <p>This deſolate lover thinking to give her his laſt kiſſe, approach'd his mouth
to <hi>Ariana's,</hi> then recollecting all the force and reſolution was remaining in
him, left her in that miſerable eſtate, to get up on horſebacke, which he did,
though with paine, and poſſeſt with confuſion and deſpaire, went on with
his ſword in his hand, to ſeeke out a certaine death amongſt thoſe that came
neere him. His arrive no whit troubled them, and <hi>Melintus</hi> ſeeing they made
not ſo much as appearance of defending themſelves, ſtayed him a while, and
regarding them with leſſe trouble, perceived it was <hi>Ariſtides, Palamede,</hi> and
the reſt of their troop,</p>
               <p>The joy that came all at once to poſſeſſe his ſoule, had a great ſtrife at the
entry, with all the afflictions that had taken place in it before: nevertheleſſe, it
<pb facs="tcp:7768:34"/>
had the maſtery of them, and making him taſte the ſweetneſſes of it, gave
him the liberty to embrace <hi>Palamede,</hi> to whom he told his errour and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Then they ran towards <hi>Ariana,</hi> who of her ſelfe returning out of her
ſwouning, at the ſame time ſaw her grifes fading away at a ſight ſo pleaſing.</p>
               <p>After the common rejoycing for being ſo happily found one of another,
<hi>Palamede</hi> was wondring to ſee all thoſe dead men with their Armes, and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celin</hi>
himſelfe in the number. <hi>Ariana</hi> made him a relation of the extreme va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of <hi>Melintus,</hi> that had ſlaine them all with admirable ſtrength and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and when they had given deſerved commendations to the courage of
<hi>Melintus,</hi> they were all of a mind, how it was a juſt puniſhment of the gods,
that <hi>Marcelin</hi> ſhould come ſo haſtily to ſeeke out his owne deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtides</hi> that knew not the cauſe of his rage, could not imagine what had
provok'd him to all thoſe villanies; and turning him towards the City that
ſeemed all over on a flame, ceas'd not bewailing this deſolation, that appear'd
yet more fearefull in the horrour of the night. But they thought it not ſafe
for them to ſtay in that place, but get the next Foreſt, for feare they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for murtherers: that in ſome deſart place they might paſſe away all the
day, for feare of being purſued, and there expect the next night to gaine the
port of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> and from thence ſet ſaile for <hi>Sicily.</hi> They us'd the horſes of theſe
dead men, and on one of them they ſet <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Ariana,</hi> and they had
gone about three miles journey, whileſt <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Ariana</hi> were inform'd
what valour <hi>Palamede</hi> had ſhowne, in favouring the going out of his father
and the reſt; and the day approaching, they entred into the Foreſt, where
getting into a place farre out of the way and obſcure, they reſolv'd there to
paſſe away the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus, Palamede,</hi> and the reſt accommodated certaine places with cloaks
and boughs to reſt in, and day light giving meanes to <hi>Ariana</hi> to conſider the
company one by one, ſhe perceiv'd <hi>Epicharis</hi> had a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l her haire burn'd, which
for all ſhe was ſorry for, yet ſhe could not chooſe but laugh at it. <hi>Epicharis</hi> was
eaſily comforted, being glad the misfortune went no further than that loſſe,
and thereupon every one began to tell his adventure. They found but one
man miſſing that <hi>Marcelin</hi> had kill'd: then they provided for their neceſſities,
and ſent a ſlave to the port to ſtay a veſſell for them, and <hi>Arcas</hi> with another
to the next village to buy meat.</p>
               <p>About midday <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> adviſed to goe ſee the paths of the
Foreſt, that they might with eaſe find the way to make their retrait by night,
and not be troubled with a continuall error; becauſe the Moone was to riſe
but late. <hi>Arcas,</hi> that never had forſaken his Maſter, followed him, that they
might the better together obſerve the turnings of wayes, and remember
them: But when they had gone through all, and were out of the wood, they
ſpyed a troop of horſemen that were comming to them, and returning againe
to <hi>Rome.</hi> They were forc'd to put themſelves againe into the entrance of the
wood to let them paſſe away, and not be ſeene of them; and when they were
very neere, they heard one of them ſaying lowd enough; It muſt needs bee
we have not taken the way they are in, for we had by this heard newes of
them: He that kill'd <hi>Marcelin</hi> and the reſt is a man remarkable enough, and has
the woman with him we are to bring to the Emperour, and when I would
have reveng'd the death of <hi>Marcelin</hi> and my companions, three or foure men
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7768:35"/>
joyned themſelves to him, ſo I was faine to ſave my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>This man ſpake too cleare to make any doubt in <hi>Melintus</hi> if it were he they
ſought or no. We are loſt, ſayes <hi>Palamede,</hi> it they finde us. <hi>Melintus</hi> made a
ſigne to him to make no noyſe, and let them paſſe: But <hi>Palamede's</hi> horſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately
tooke him to neighing, and ſome of this troop willing to know
what it meant, advanc'd them, and ſeeing they were three men a horſebacke
that would ſave themſelves at their comming, they call'd up their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to purſue them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> in deſpaire for being diſcovered, and brought to flying, ſaid to
<hi>Palamede</hi> they were to goe a way quite contrary to that wherein <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and
<hi>Ariana</hi> were, becauſe ſhe it was they ſought. Their horſes were better than
thoſe that followed them, ſo as they were ſoone farre off them: but the others
being in great number, divided into divers troops to encloſe them, if they
meant not to come out of the wood, and they were not deceived, for that
theſe friends encountring a way that ſeparated into two branches, <hi>Melintus</hi>
and <hi>Arcas</hi> by chance tooke one path in running away, and <hi>Palamede</hi> another,
who thinking very ſoone to rejoyne him with <hi>Melintus,</hi> was ſurpriz'd by
foure or five ſouldiers that cut off his way from him; and after having ſuſtaind
his firſt fury, put him out of all hope of eſcaping their hands. <hi>Melintus</hi> that
was out of all perill, hearing the noyſe afarre off, doubted of his friends miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
and reſolv'd to goe helpe him, commanded <hi>Arcas</hi> to ſave himſelfe
while he went to him, and to goe advertiſe <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Ariana</hi> that it was
ſhee they ſought for, and that they ſhould have a care not to goe from the
place they were in, but when the night came on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then hee charged him
eſpecially if he ſhould heare no newes from them, to conduct them out of
the wood by the wayes they had marked out, and from thence ſtraight to the
port, and to embarque with them as ſoone as poſſible might be for <hi>Sicily.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
ſaid <hi>Arcas,</hi> command me not to leave you, I cannot obey you with ſo
much cowardneſſe. <hi>Arcas,</hi> anſwered <hi>Melintus,</hi> aſſure thy ſelfe, thou canſt not
doe me a greater ſervice than this I deſire of thee: if we returne not to them
within a while, thou ſhalt tell them, how we were ſtayed by theſe ſouldiers
that tooke us to deliver us into the hands of Juſtice, from which our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
ſhall well know how to preſerve us: and above all, abandon not <hi>Ariana.</hi>
Adiew, my deare <hi>Arcas,</hi> ſaid he, embracing him; then he gallop'd away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſide where he had heard the noyſe.</p>
               <p>This poore ſervant could not find in his heart to quit his Maſter, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him ſtill, but <hi>Melintus</hi> turning his head and perceiving him, cryed to
him; Art thou well advis'd, <hi>Arcas,</hi> how thou giveſt me my death? and if
thou followeſt me any more, I ſhall not live an houre longer. <hi>Arcas</hi> was thus
conſtrain'd, the teares in his eyes, to leave his Maſter, who preſently arriv'd
at the place where <hi>Palamede</hi> was environ'd with five or ſix horſemen, that
cryed out to him to render himſelfe, after ſeeing two of their comerades ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dead upon the place by his hand. <hi>Palamede</hi> had put him into the thickeſt
ſtrength of the wood, where he could not be taken behind, and defended
himſelfe before with much courage. <hi>Melintus</hi> perceiving him in that danger,
tooke his ſword in his hand, and entring in amongſt them, joyned to his friend,
after having ſtrucke off the ſhoulder of a ſouldier that hindred his approach
to him: <hi>Palamede</hi> ſeeing himſelfe inforc'd by this ſuccours, doubled his blows,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7768:35"/>
and <hi>Melintus</hi> having hurt two of them to death, and not thinking the reſt
were able to reſiſt them, had hope to be ſoone diſpatcht of them, had it not
beene for the arrive often or twelve Souldiours that came to incompaſſe
th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m on all ſides.</p>
               <p>Their forces diminiſht, and their enemies increas'd, for the number of
thoſe they had kill'd, was ſoone repair'd by thoſe that came in ſtill upon
them: Nevertheleſſe the great courage of <hi>Melintus</hi> ſuffer'd him not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire,
and being animated with a juſt choler, he ſtruck one downe at his feet
with a reverſe blow he gave him on the middeſt of his body, under the arme
he had lift up to ſtrike him: from thence purſuing the firſt he met, he cleft
his forhead, and the bloud that ran from him in abundance upon his eyes,
blinded him, and put him out of this combat. <hi>Palamede</hi> call'd up his forces,
for to ſecond <hi>Melintus,</hi> and ſeeing a Souldiour that with both hands had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
his ſword to cleave his head, he prevented him, and with one blow
ſtruck off his hands and ſword that went in vaine to ſtrike the ground. This
man carried away by his horſe, and having nothing more left him to hold the
bridle, was preſently throwne downe, and falling upon his face, found thoſe
hands he wanted to ſave him. <hi>Melintus</hi> on the other ſide ſeeing two of their
enemies that moſt preſs'd him, went betweene them both, and lifting up
his arme to give him a full blow that was on his left hand, and ſeeing him in
defence, alter'd his deſigne, and letting goe a ſtrong back-blow cleft the
head of him that was on his right hand, with one ſtroake having ſent feare to
the one of them, and death to the other. He that expected the blow ſhut his
eyes, and put his ſword before his head, and his horſe carrying him away at
the ſame time he could not ſee a bough of a tree that overthrew him: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
getting up againe, and ſeeing <hi>Melintus</hi> returning to him, he pierced
his ſword into the flanks of his horſe, and laid him dead on the ground. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamede</hi>
would have help'd him, but at the ſame time a Souldiour ſeeing what
had happened to <hi>Melintus,</hi> kill'd his horſe inlike manner, having thought it the
only way to end the fight: all they could doe was to keepe themſelves from
being preſt downe under the fall, and to diſ-ingage themſelves that they
might fight it out on foot: but what ever vaillance was in them, the others
had ſoone trodden upon them with their horſes, but that two came in crying,
they ſhould not kill them, and that they were to be carried priſoners to <hi>Rome.</hi>
This command ſtaied the fury of all thoſe men that were animated for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
and made <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> reſolve to yeeld themſelves.</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Arcas</hi> went to bring <hi>Ariſtides</hi> the ſad newes of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
of his ſonne and <hi>Melintus. Ariſtides</hi> ſet himſelfe to weeping and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing:
but <hi>Ariana</hi> fell downe for griefe into the armes ofher deare <hi>Epicha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
and when this deſolate company had made a thouſand complaints for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reduc'd to hide themſelves in ſtead of ſuccouring them; in the end, ſome
were ſet to keepe ſentinell. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> weary of travaile, overcome with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and having had no repoſe the night before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fell aſleepe: but <hi>Ariana</hi> that
had taken a little ſleepe in the morning within that wood, and that had other
cares upon her, retiring her to the place where <hi>Melintus</hi> had himſelfe fitted
her with branches, ſhe laid her downe upon <hi>Epicharis</hi> knees, and melting into
teares, could not receive any conſolation.</p>
               <p>This maid accus'd her of too great weakneſſe, and praid her to take ſome
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7768:36"/>
reſt: but ſhe ſaid to her; Ceaſe, my deare maid, to comfort me: if thou kneweſt
the loſſes I ſuſtaine, thou would'ſt complaine as much as I doe my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
There is yet no cauſe, ſayes <hi>Epicharis,</hi> to deſpaire. <hi>Arcas</hi> hath told you,
how they deſir'd not to have their lives, but would only take them priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
And doſt thou thinke, ſaid <hi>Ariana,</hi> they would not revenge the deaths
of them they kill'd in their owne defence? and then a torrent of teares
ſtopt her ſpeech. I know well, ſaid <hi>Epicharis,</hi> that you love nothing in the
world ſo much as that brother. Thou knoweſt that, interrupted ſhe, but thou
art ignorant how deare the other perſon is to me that I loſe with him; and
this double loſſe makes that I cannot have teares ſufficient to repreſent to thee
my ſorrow. <hi>Epicharis</hi> a little a maz'd, let her weepe ſome time, then replide
thus: Madam, in your affliction I have a certaine kind of joy, to learne the
truth of a thing which I have all my life paſſionately deſir'd: for I ever
thought, that nothing but you was worthy of <hi>Melintus,</hi> and that <hi>Melintus</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was worthy of you. The gods without doubt will favour ſo diſcreet and
vertuous a friendſhip, and not permit you be long time ſeparated. Alas! <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picharis,</hi>
ſaid <hi>Ariana,</hi> what miſeries doe I foreſee if once I returne without
him into <hi>Sicily;</hi> and yet he ordaines me this, deſiring rather to dye, than ſee
me in the hands of theſe in famous raviſhers: for aſſure thy ſelfe, <hi>Epicharis,</hi>
never was there an affection ſo perfect, or ſo full of reſpect, as this he hath to
mee. He has ever had ſo much feare of diſpleaſing mee, knowing how I have
in horrour all thoſe fooleries of love, that unleſſe the gods had produc'd in me
an affection like unto his, that gave him leave to expreſſe ſomething of it to
mee, I ſhould ſcarce have had any knowledge thereof yet. And I doe not
know alſo, whether he would be pleas'd with me for diſcovering ſo much of
it to thee as I have done. Madam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anſwer'd <hi>Epicharis,</hi> you know what fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
I have vowed to you: it would be an injury to the paſſion I have for you,
to conceale your ſecrets from mee, knowing how much I deſire to ſerve you,
and eaſe your troubles: I beleeve he would not be ſorry for my knowing it,
if he knew the deſire I had to ſee you both happy together. Deare <hi>Epicharis,</hi>
replies <hi>Ariana,</hi> knowing our humours, doſt thou beleeve ever any enjoyed
a like felicity, if this might come to paſſe? But thou knoweſt to whom I am
deſtin'd by my father, and this laſt diſaſter is of that nature, that I can hardly
hope ever againe to ſee alive, either him, or my deare brother. <hi>Ariana</hi>
ever renuing her weeping; and <hi>Epicharis</hi> knowing how her ſorrow was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
when ſhe ſpake of the affection of <hi>Melintus,</hi> ſaid to her, Madam, the
gods will preſerve for you this lovely <hi>Melintus,</hi> and ſince they have given him
you will not ſuffer any diſpoſitions of the earth contrary to their will. Live
at more repoſe, and be confident in their goodneſſe: in the meane time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you cannot ſleepe, I ſhall take it for a great favour, if you pleaſe to take
the paine to tell me, how you came to know the beginning of this affection.
I will then, ſaid <hi>Ariana,</hi> ſpend in ſo deare an entertainment what remaines
of the day, before we are to part: and having taken care that no body might
over-heare them, after ſhe had wiped her eyes, ſhe ſpake thus.</p>

with ſecret knowledge of the qualities we are to acquire, and make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
deſires whereof we know not the cauſe, to guide us to the poſſeſſion of
that which is moſt honeſt and moſt profitable for us.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt find theſe very true obſervations, by that I ſhall tell thee of the
ſtrange fortune of <hi>Melintus,</hi> of the perfections he has been carefull to get, and
of the eſteeme we had each of other, even before ever we ſaw one another:
for you muſt know, that I knew him not before he went from <hi>Siracuſe</hi> to
<hi>Athens</hi> for to learne all the ſciences and exerciſes fitting for a perſon of his
condition. In all which he was ſo proſperous, that they that return'd from
<hi>Greece</hi> ſpake of nothing but his perfections, and the facility he had to have
good ſucceſſe in what ever he undertooke. One day my brother in his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
gave me notice of the friendſhip they had made ſure to one another,
with ſo many advantageous words for <hi>Melintus,</hi> and expreſſions of joy for
himſelfe, that I thought <hi>Melintus</hi> muſt be ſomething above the common ſort,
ſince my brother that was none of the leaſt eſteemed, conceived to have
gained ſo great a good fortune in his affection. I ſignified to him by my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the part I tooke in his contentment, and beſide that the profit I ſhould
have by it, by hearing newes of him at <hi>Telephus</hi> houſe that was father to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi>
when he were careleſſe of writing. <hi>Palamede</hi> ſhewed him this letter,
and he approv'd it, for a certaine thing he ſaid pleas'd him, and afterwards in
thoſe he writ to <hi>Telephus</hi> he alwayes mention'd ſomething concerning <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
and me: ſo as when ever I was in paine for the health of my brother,
I ſent to <hi>Telephus,</hi> that made no difficulty to let me ſee the whole letters of
<hi>Melintus:</hi> But I proteſt to you, I ſaw there a faſhion of writing ſo ſweet, and
a reſpect he gave <hi>Telephus</hi> ſo great, and yet mixt with an honeſt boldneſſe,
that I had a great deſire to be acquainted with him one day. On the other
ſide I wrote to <hi>Palamede</hi> with more care; that if it hapned he ſhewed my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to <hi>Melintus,</hi> he might have a more favourable opinion of me. I was not
miſtaken, for after that, he expreſt to me, when he had ſeene what I had
writ, and knowne me by ſome relation my brother made him, what great
deſire he had to accompliſh the time that was preſcrib'd him by <hi>Telephus,</hi> that
he might come home into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and ſee mee.</p>
                  <p>During that time there paſſed occaſions that augmented ſtill the eſteeme
wee began to have each of other, for he went away with the honour of horſe
races at the Olympick games, and the glory of making the beſt verſes, as my
brother alſo had the prize of the Harpe: So happily that they made our City
glorious above all the townes that ſent to thoſe games the excellenteſt men
they had for all exerciſes. On the other ſide a prize having beene propounded
at <hi>Siracuſe</hi> for the faireſt woman, in the favour of whom moſt lovers would
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7768:37"/>
preſent themſelves, and recite verſes: all the women that pretended to beauty
in the City dreſt up themſelves to appeare that day on the Theaters, and
diſpute this victory: but I deſpiſing it, or elſe having no hope to carry it,
ſhut up my ſelfe in the houſe, what ever they could doe to perſwade mee to
goe thither: nevertheleſſe ſome that recited, having complain'd at the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of their Miſtreſſe, and nam'd me, the Judges (without ſeeing me) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
the crowne of flowers that was the prize, to be given me, and brought
it to my lodging, when I was very farre off from that enterprize. <hi>Melintus</hi>
having learn'd by the letter my father wrote to <hi>Palamede</hi> the glory I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
after the contempt I made of it, conceiv'd yet a greater eſtimation of
mee, and had no other thought now but to be ſoone at <hi>Siracuſe.</hi> At length
<hi>Palamede</hi> ſent us word, he prepar'd to come home with <hi>Melintus:</hi> but I muſt
tell thee, I did prepare my ſelfe with a farre greater care to receive them.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe the encounter they made of <hi>Corbulo</hi> that was going againſt
the <hi>Parthians,</hi> greatly ſtaied this returne; but it as much avanc't and rendred
glorious the reputation of <hi>Melintus,</hi> who following him into <hi>Aſia</hi> with my
brother, did ſo memorable actions in that expedition, that there was no other
talke but of <hi>Melintus</hi> valour: which increas'd marvellouſly that opinion I had
of him, and made me judge that there was ſome ſympathy betweene his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and mine.</p>
                  <p>When occaſions were wanting to give other proofes of their valour, they
parted from <hi>Aſia,</hi> and landing in <hi>Sicily,</hi> gave advice of their returne, for to
be receiv'd as victors at the Olympique games, according to the purpoſe the
<hi>Siracuſians</hi> had for them: but they had ſince added many other victories with
much more danger and glory, which ought to make their reception ſtill
more honourable.</p>
                  <p>The newes was receiv'd of all with a great joy, but of me with ſurprize,
conſidering I ſhould ſee <hi>Melintus,</hi> whom I made ſo great account of by reaſon
of his renowne. There was beaten downe a pane of a wall, according to the
cuſtome in all countries, to receive them that have gained the honour of the
Olympique games: and I ſaid, that ſince the ſieges they had beene at, they
were not us'd to enter into Cities but by breaches, not by the gates of them.</p>
                  <p>Every thing was in a readineſſe to receive them, and thoſe of the City were
of opinion to goe out to meet them, and in exchange to render them the
honour they had gain'd to their country. I was choſen to give them the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
preſents; to <hi>Melintus</hi> a white horſe, and a ſword hanging in a Carnation
ſcarfe imbroider'd with ſilver; and to my brother a Caſock of a moſt rich
worke, with a quiver garniſh'd with gilded ſhafts, and a bow of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>They had beene advertiz'd of the reception was to be given them: ſo as
<hi>Melintus</hi> and my brother ſtill clothed after the Greeke faſhion, appear'd
mounted on faire horſes in the head of thoſe of their traine, and ſome other
of their friends, that had gone out before us. I was upon a pled nagge that
had a white foot-cloth, I my ſelfe was alſo cloth'd in white, with my haire
hanging downe crowned with a garland of flowers, and went by my uncle
<hi>Dicearchus</hi> ſide, that was the chiefe of thoſe of the towne: The horſe deſtin'd
to <hi>Melintus</hi> was lead neere me by two footmen, that held him on both ſides
with great cords of purple colour that ſerv'd for reines; then followed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man that carried the ſword and ſcarfe; thoſe that held the caſack, the
<pb facs="tcp:7768:37"/>
bow, and the quiver, went in their order, and after them an infinite number
of people.</p>
                  <p>At our meeting <hi>Melintus</hi> alighted from his horſe; <hi>Dicearchus</hi> did the like:
preſently two men helpe me alſo to deſcend; and <hi>Melintus</hi> having ſaluted us,
I prepar'd my ſelfe to ſpeake to him: but I was ſo troubled to ſee the perſon
whoſe knowledge I had deſir'd, goe with ſuch a grace, and ſo full of Iuſtre,
and honour, that I had much adoe to reaſſure my ſelfe. I know not if he were
deceiv'd in what he had fancied in him concerning me: yet he has ſworne to
me ſince, that he was never ſo taken, as when he ſaw me in the height of all
this preparation and traine. I thanked them in the name of all the people
for the honours they had procur'd to their Countrey, in acknowledgement of
which I prayed them to accept theſe preſents; and then was given mee one
of the ſtrings that were in ſtead of reines to the horſe, which I preſented to
<hi>Melintus:</hi> but when I tooke the Sword and Scarfe I had charge to put upon
him, I doe not thinke that in all my life I ever bluſh'd ſo much, or was ſeiz'd
with ſo ſtrange a trembling: And I was very glad of paſſing towards my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to put me in countenance againe, by making him the preſent was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
him. I well remember that <hi>Melintus</hi> ſpake to mee to give mee thanks
for the honour they did him: but I tooke no heed to what he ſaid, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
was I; and if I had beene to reply, I muſt have ſtood mute: Hee
told me ſince, his anſwer was, that his Countrey which had given him birth,
might attribute to her ſelfe as her owne, all that ever hee ſhould be able to
doe, and that he was a debtor to her for all the glory of it; nevertheleſſe hee
received theſe preſents, not as recompences, but as new obligations; as for
<hi>Palamede,</hi> I cannot call to minde in what manner he thanked me. After that,
I was ſet a horſebacke againe by <hi>Melintus,</hi> who preſently mounted upon that
horſe I had given him, and ever accompanied me, in managing him with a
great grace.</p>
                  <p>I ceas'd not admiring every thing he did, and I well perceiv'd he was not
without trouble for his part: for he look'd upon me ſometimes with an eye
that ſhewed aſtoniſhment, and a paſſion new comming on, but ſo modeſtly,
that there was none but my ſelfe that could obſerve it. Wee arriv'd in this
manner at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and he waited on me to my lodging, where hee left mee
with <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Dicearchus:</hi> his friends with the reſt of the people brought
him to <hi>Telephus</hi> houſe.</p>
                  <p>All the night long I let my imagination wander upon every thing I had
ſeene perfect in <hi>Melintus.</hi> That ſweet and aſſured face, that free making, the
grace and comelineſſe in all his actions, and his faſhion of ſpeech ſo full of
mildneſſe and vivacity, made me avow that I had never ſeene any thing ſo
amiable: but as I was concluding ſomething to his advantage, and was
ſurpriz'd in that conceit, the diſadinfull humour that is naturall to me, filled
me with ſhame, and fortified me againſt all that merit. Then ſeeing how my
father inclin'd to marry me to <hi>Amintas,</hi> ſonne of <hi>Diocles,</hi> the richeſt in <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,</hi>
and that <hi>Melintus</hi> poſſeſt not ſo great an eſtate as was in our houſe, my
ſtomacke could not then conſent for his ſake I ſhould ſuffer ſo much unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in my mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diocles</hi> comming to be rich in a little time, as the rumour went then, by the
acquiſition he had made of the goods of certaine baniſh'd men, was willing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7768:38"/>
to ſtay himſelfe upon the authority <hi>Dicearchus</hi> had in the City: but my uncle
oppos'd it, becauſe <hi>Diocles</hi> had ever beene of a faction contrary to his; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
<hi>Ariſtides</hi> did what he poſſibly could to perſwade his brother, ſeeing
nothing more advantageous for me in <hi>Syracuſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was at that time thou wert given me by <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> who having bought
thee very young upon the Sea coaſt, had bred thee ſtill in hope that his
wife <hi>Acidalia</hi> might have children, that thou mightſt ſerve for company and
entertainment too: but <hi>Acidalia</hi> being dead, he was reſolv'd to give thee to
me, perceiving I had inclination to love thee. I ſhall never forget, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Epicharis,</hi> that happy change of my condition; for I may well ſay that I
began but to live ſince I was at your ſervice, which I would preferre to the
moſt exalted eſtate that were upon earth: for I never had but vexation with
<hi>Dicearchus</hi> and his wife, though they brought me up with much care and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
but ſince I came to you, my life is become as happy as I could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd.
I know well, replyes <hi>Ariana,</hi> what contentment thou enjoyeſt, being
certaine of my love to thee: but give me leave to goe on, and thou ſhalt ſee
if I be not as much aſſur'd in thine. Then ſhe continues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melintus</hi> fearing to ſeeme impatient, was foure or five dayes without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me, except one time at the Temple: but <hi>Palamede</hi> going to viſit him, as
he did often, <hi>Melintus</hi> intreated him to bring him to our houſe, and preſent
him to mee. He had then an eſteeme of me great enough, and I alſo thought
there was not in the world a ſpirit more ſublim'd than his: in ſuch ſort that
wee were both fearfull at this meeting; and for the good opinion that each
had of themſelves, wee deſir'd alſo both of us to make our ſelves be feared.
After I underſtood he was come in, I collected all the confidence I had, and
<hi>Palamede</hi> bringing him to ſalute me, ſayes to me; Siſter, ſee here a man that
as well deſerves you ſhould receive him in private, as you have done in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
and whom you muſt love, if you love me, for we are both but one and
the ſame thing. I anſwered him: Brother, I ſhall never be wanting to honour
that which you love; and if I eſteem'd not <hi>Melintus</hi> qualities, I ſhould feare
ſingularity, and to be left alone of my party. Madam, ſaid <hi>Melintus</hi> then, if
you ſhould be alone in making ſmall account of me, your party ſhould at the
leaſt be the moſt juſt, if not the greateſt. <hi>Melintus,</hi> ſayes my brother interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him, let us not loſe time in telling what your worth is; my ſiſter knowes
it, by the report I have made of it to her, and by your owne reputation. She
muſt of neceſſity confeſſe, there is not a man upon earth more accompliſh'd
than you; but confeſſe you too, that I have a ſiſter very lovely. Brother,
ſayes I to him, ſpeake not of me, we may have better entertainment: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
how would you have <hi>Melintus</hi> give a judgement of that he has yet no
knowledge of? Thereupon I invited him to ſit downe; and <hi>Melintus</hi> replies;
Madam, I already knew the beauty of your minde, by the letters <hi>Palamede</hi>
receiv'd from you, and ſince that of the face is knowne as ſoone as it is ſeene,
ſuffer me to judge of you at this very houre, and that I tell you, that fame
which is accuſtom'd to increaſe the deſert of every thing it would commend,
hath beene conſtrain'd to diminiſh yours, being impoſſible to bee publiſh'd
according to the greatneſſe of it. I anſwer'd him, I pray you leave there your
praiſes, which civility obliges to give, rather than truth: I did not thinke
you could have reſolv'd to flatter any body, ſuch an opinion had I conceiv'd
<pb facs="tcp:7768:38"/>
of your vertue. Praiſes, replies he, are not flatteries, but when they are ſpent
upon ſubjects unworthy of them: but vertue it ſelfe refuſes them not for her
recompence. It is true, ſayes I to him, but they that know their owne wants,
as I doe, ought to take praiſes as reproaches for not having thoſe qualities are
attributed to them; and there are no people love them, like thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
they deſerve them, which <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s a vanity in ſupportable. He knew by this
I endur'd not commendations, and that hee muſt treat with mee otherwiſe
than with many other women: which I obſerv'd by the amazement appear'd
in him; and becauſe, changing the tune of his voyce, he ſaid to me; Pardon
me, Madam, if I muſt ſtill commend you, when I ſhall tell you, it is a marke
of great vertue, not to be able to endure to be commended: and they that
have a ſoule well order'd bluſh ordinarily at it, which reſtifies a kinde of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and that one takes offence. Neither had I ever attempted to judge of
you, if <hi>Palamede</hi> had not obliged me to confeſſe that you were very lovely.
My brother then mingled his wilde diſcourſe to ours, and ſaid, That after he
had a long time hearkened to us, he found my humour was very contrary to
that of all the women he had practis'd with; and that the beleefe of <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
was very differing from his alſo, for he thought he could not doe a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
pleaſure to women, than to tell them they are perfectly handſome: that
he never attaind to their good graces but by this entry; and how after hee
had beene willing to perſwade them that they had no defect, in the end hee
was ſo perſwaded himſelfe, and found them more lovely. Tis true, anſwers
<hi>Melintus,</hi> that many times one proſpers that way, for that commonly there is
ſome fault; and this faſhion is not to overcome, but to let ones ſelfe be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd
on either ſide: and this is rather out of weakneſſe to be engag'd one
to other, than by dexterity to engage that which one loves. It matters not,
ſaid my brother, provided one be content. Be aſſur'd, replide <hi>Melintus,</hi> that
you never obtain'd a favour by thoſe meanes, but that you found ſome remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
defect in her you ſued to, by which ſhe let her ſelfe be caught. Tis true,
anſwer'd my brother, but never would there be aconqueſt, if the defect were
not found: and I love thoſe of that ſort much better than thoſe whom ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
makes inacceſſible. They are more proper for you, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> for the
favours you deſire of them, but confeſſe if in your judgement you doe not
more eſteeme the other. There is no doubt, anſwers my brother, but I give
them over, becauſe they eſteeme not me ſufficiently. I gave eare to this their
diſcourſe, and was very glad that <hi>Melintus</hi> approv'd modeſty, and expreſt
with ſuch a grace, and vertuous conceits, the ſame thoughts I had. The reſt
of the day paſt away in ſuch diſcourſes as theſe, whereby I was perſwaded
that the ſpirit of <hi>Melintus</hi> had a great ſympathy with mine, and he conſidered
alſo in what manner he was to demeane himſelfe with me, and that there was
no hope I could be gained by flatteries.</p>
                  <p>After this viſit he quite alter'd his diſcourſe; for inſtead of ſpeaking to
me either of my beauty, or his love, he ſeem'd very farre from all paſſion, and
all our entertainments were concerning the paſſions of others, wherein we
obſerv'd a thouſand faults, and as many pooreneſſes of ſpirit: and inſenſibly
we taught one another, how we were to be according to our owne deſire,
both to love perfectly, and make us worthy to be loved. In the end it ſeem'd
that ſpeaking of others, we ſpake thus to one another: Since you have ſuch
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7768:39"/>
thoughts as theſe, I can love you well ſo. He durſt never tell me he lov'd me,
but his actions ſufficiently did it; and then when hee thought no body ſaw
him but I, his cares to pleaſe me were too intelligible. See how ſtrange our
humours are, a thouſand ſervices he rendred me were very agreeable; yet for
all that I ſhould be offended at the leaſt expreſſion of love he made me by his
mouth, and forbade him my ſight. So as he was forc'd to diſcover himſelfe by
other meanes were pleaſing enough to me, as by many verſes he gave me, a
part whereof I would repeat to thee, if my affliction permitted me to thinke
of ſuch gentilleſſes. But I muſt needs at leaſt tell thee the encounter I made of
a lover very differing in all manner of qualities; 'twas of the proud <hi>Garamant;</hi>
of whom thou haſt heard told pleaſant tales enow, but yet never cameſt to
know what paſs'd betwixt us, becauſe the affaire was kept ſecret. He had his
originall from <hi>Africa,</hi> and for this that we knew not his extraction, hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
to make great additions thereby touching his birth; and upon that
ground he would not beleeve there was any body in all <hi>Sicily</hi> that durſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
pedigree with him: nay, he maintain'd the excellency of his arrogant
humour with certaine reaſons, whereby he would prove, that one could not
have a good ſpirit, unleſſe he had as much pride as he. I was importun'd with
his viſits; nevertheleſſe being acquainted with his proud and ridiculous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
he ſometimes ſerv'd to make me laugh, and I did often pleaſe my ſelfe
in mocking at him, feigning that I beleev'd his vanities. Hee contrariwiſe
thought I made a very great eſtimation of him, and that I beleev'd the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
honour could arrive to me, were, to ſee my ſelfe lov'd by a man of that
importance.</p>
                  <p>One day when I was alone, he came to ſee me, and not willing to loſe the
opportunity of ſpeaking to me, he told me in a cold faſhion, that he had news
to let me know, which would not be unacceptable. I deſir'd him to tell mee
it. 'Tis this, ſayes he, that I have quite broke with <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> (that was one of
the handſomeſt in <hi>Syracuſe.)</hi> And wherein, ſayes I to him, may this buſineſſe
concerne me? Becauſe, anſwers he, there was nothing but the truſt I had in
her that hindred me giving my ſelfe to you. And this was the newes that muſt
be ſo welcome to me. Is it poſſible, ſaid <hi>Epicharis</hi> interrupting her, the man
could be ſo impertinent? Wonder not at that, replide <hi>Ariana,</hi> heare onely
that remaines; then ſhee went on; I was willing to entertaine him in this
vaine humour, as I had accuſtomed, and told him; Truly, you could not have
brought me a more agreeable newes, if it were to be beleev'd; but I dare not
hope you are minded to doe me ſo much honour, acknowledging my ſelfe
unworthy of it. No, continued he, I will have you beleeve it, although your
modeſty makes ſome difficulty, and I hope our intelligence ſhall prove moſt
perfect: for as I make my ſelfe as contrary as may be to the humour of thoſe
cowards that loſe the advantages of our ſex, ſubmitting themſelves to Ladies
by a thouſand flatteries; ſo I perceive not in you the arrogancy of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull
women, that acknowledge not the defects of their ſex; and by
this I find that our judgements are equally diſabuſed of thoſe ordinary errors,
and are firme in the true opinions that each of us both ought to have of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
I ſmiled, looking on him, and wondred to what end this poore wretch
loſt himſelfe in his vaine ravings. Hee contrarily beleev'd that I laugh'd for
exceſſe of joy, that he would take the paines to love me, and had this fooliſh
<pb facs="tcp:7768:39"/>
conceit that the more he leſſen'd me, the more I thought my ſelfe beholding
to him. At laſt, becauſe I would ſee to what point his preſumption would
attaine, I told him, that ſince it was his will to make mee ſo happy, I intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to inſtruct me how I might pleaſe him by living with him, to the end
I might never be wanting in the reſpect was due to the greatneſſe of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
My minion (ſaid he taking me by the hand, and thinking to oblige me
much by this kind word) only love me, and conſider what my worth may
be, and then you ſhall ever give me honour enough; as for my friendſhip you
may be aſſur'd of it, as long as you ſhall live after this faſhion; I will not abuſe
you with a thouſand oaths, as others doe, or with crouchings that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of my ſelfe: you ſee how I am not diſguis'd, but what I ſpeake muſt
of neceſſity be that I thinke. Herein he had very good reaſon. There are
many, ſaid he, that eſteeme that pride, which is in effect but a good ſpirit, and
a wholeſome knowledge of ones ſelfe: Tis a ſigne a man feeles a want in
himſelfe, when he does abaſe him out of complaiſance: and amongſt men,
that which they call courteſie and honeſty, I call cowardlineſſe and baſeneſſe:
It is to teſtifie that one cannot ſubfiſt by himſelfe, when he goes about ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the good will and ſuſtentation of others. It ſeemes you would be oblig'd
to them for letting you alone in quiet, and ſubmitting to their mercy, you
held not your owne life but at their favour.</p>
                  <p>I made as if I approved all he ſaid, and admir'd the good apprehenſions he
had of all things. For me, goes he forward, I am determin'd to deſpiſe all the
world, as though I defied every one to hurt me, and were aſſur'd againſt ſo
many perſons by my owne ſtrength alone: It ſeemes that I oppoſe my ſelfe
alone to all the world together, and finding how thoſe that approach mee
come with reſpect and ſilence; I am pleas'd in my ſelfe to ſee how I thus tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over all, and that my only countenance makes me ſo dreadfull. He made
me a thouſand ſuch like diſcourſes, but the eſtate I am in that cannot ſuffer
fooleries, will not permit me to repeat them, no nor ſo much as to remember
them. I confeſſe to thee, <hi>Epicharis,</hi> I had a great delight with my ſelfe at ſo
ſtrange a folly, but I wanted a third perſon to laugh with, and mock him, and
it was an extreme diſpleaſure to me to be alone at this fine entertainment; I
did nothing but fix my eyes upon him, not willing to ſpend a reply, either to
diſabuſe him, or to conſent any more to his diſcourſe. I began to be weary
of him, and had in the end ſhamefully ſent him packing, but that for my qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe,
<hi>Melintus</hi> and my brother came in: then I could not containe my ſelfe,
but as ſoone as they were ſet, I conceiv'd indeed an enterprize too bold for my
wit to ſeeme capable of. I would impart to them <hi>Garamant's</hi> entertainment,
without naming him in his owne preſence, for my owne eaſe and his confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
and I ſaid to them, I was in great impatience till I ſaw you, to tell the
great good fortune is happened to me. <hi>Melintus</hi> ask'd me what it was. Tis this,
ſay I, that I have got a ſervant I am infinitely proud of. He expreſt to me
how he rejoyc'd at it for my ſake, and inquir'd if he might not by any meanes
know his name. This is the thing, ſaid I to him, I cannot learne you: but I
will tell you truly in what ſort he made me offer of his ſervice. Then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to report as faithfully as I could <hi>Garamant's</hi> diſcourſes, remarking all his
ſottiſhneſſe and impertinencies: whereupon he bluſh't, and he grew pale and
I died with laughing to ſee how he knew not what poſture to put himſelfe in.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7768:40"/>
                     <hi>Melintus</hi> and my brother could not beleeve there had beene ſo great extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
of braine, and at every word demanded if that were poſſible. I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to tell them at large all the excellent reaſonings of <hi>Garamont,</hi> and reſerve
nothing, ſo much recreated was I in the ſtory of it; and every fondneſſe of
his wanted not the qualification of titles it deſerv'd, and they were ſo many
ſenſible blowes to this honeſt man that was preſent, and that ſuffer'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to be thus prick't, and never cried out. At laſt <hi>Melintus</hi> ask'd mee, if I
had not invented ſo pleaſant a buſineſſe. I told him, for to poſſeſſe the other
with deſperation, and make them underſtand of whom I had ſpoken. <hi>Gara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi>
ſhall witneſſe for me, if I ſay any thing but what is true. Then they
well conceiv'd, that it was his entertainment I had made the relation of, for as
they look't upon him, they ſaw in what ſort he was abaſhed, and beſides they
were acquainted with his humour. <hi>Garamant</hi> ſeeing he was diſcover'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd
to ſpeake, knew not what party to take, whether he ought to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for their mocking him, or whether he were to maintaine that which had
thus declar'd his affection: his cowardneſſe not permitting, the firſt, he was
reſolv'd for the ſecond, becauſe he might then ſpeake in a third perſon, and
he ſaid how he found not ſo much to be blam'd as they did, in the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of that man, and that if every man govern'd himſelfe ſo, the Ladies
would be conſtrain'd to baniſh this great ſeverity they obſerve, and confeſſe
that they have a great obligation to the men for loving them. <hi>Melintus</hi> then
began to ſpeake finding himſelfe offended in my perſon, and to ſuſtaine my
cauſe, ask'd him whereupon he grounded this vanity: upon this, ſayes he,
that for one advantage women have above us, which is beauty, men have a
thouſand above them, which are yet of a farre greater conſequence: as the
height of courage, prudence, force and addreſſe of the body, with an infinite
number of others. <hi>Melintus</hi> anſwered him; Although wee had theſe advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
I find them very poore ones, ſince we are to ſubmit them all to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of their beauty: but wee are very farre from having them, for a Lady
ſhewes more courage in the conſervation of her honour, and more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the carriage of her ſelfe, than we are able to doe in any action:
they have more hard trials to endure than wee, and more conſequences to
foreſee. They are inceſſantly to be upon their guard, and yet that in ſo
great a circumſpection, there appeare no conſtraint, and whether this be
done with paine, or with facility, they are to be commended either for their
great carefulneſſe, or elſe for their great quickneſſe of wit. We on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
let ſcape a thouſand ſpeeches, and doe a thouſand actions, that would
be as many crimes to Ladies, which witneſſes in them a nature much more
perfect than ours, and a greater purity of vertue, wherein the leaſt fault
would make a great ſpot. There remaines nothing in us but the ſtrength of
the body, which is but a very poore advantage to prevaile with: as if the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were to be more eſteem'd than a man, becauſe he is ſtronger. Wit ever
triumphs over force. The ſtrongeſt people of the world are not the moſt
renowned: the <hi>Greekes</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> have alwayes vanquiſht the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
that ſurpaſs'd them in ſtrength of body. Beſides there is not a man ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull,
but a Lady rules him: there needs but a looke or a word, and wee
are ſtruck downe, and then we muſt come to prayers and ſubmiſſions, which
is an infallible mark of their advantage; for he that ſues to another, without
<pb facs="tcp:7768:40"/>
doubt finds himſelfe the weakeſt. <hi>Garamant</hi> ſayes to him, you would alleage
farre differing reaſons againſt them, if <hi>Ariana</hi> were not preſent, and it grieves
me to ſee we are ſo poore ſpirited to employ the ſame force of wit wee excell
them in, to make them beleeve they excell us. Nay contrary, replide <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi>
if <hi>Ariana</hi> were not here, I would not content my ſelfe with reaſons,
which I uſe for her ſatisfaction, and not yours; but the reſpect of her keeps
me from letting you ſee how farre I diſeſteeme you, for conteſting this cauſe
ſo to no purpoſe in her preſence. <hi>Melintus</hi> modeſty ſuffer'd him not to make
any more quarrelling with him before mee, for feare of giving me offence;
but my brother could not endure this foole in my chamber, and told him, You
take upon you too much intereſt in this cauſe, not to be that very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and ridiculous fellow that made her all thoſe diſcourſes; I counſell you
to get you gone quickly hence, if you have not a mind to ſee your ſelfe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
in her ſight for your impudent follies. Hee was thus forc'd to goe his
way, mock'd of all, with the greateſt ſhame a man could poſſibly receive:
and the arrogant fellow was ſuch a coward, that hee never durſt returne a
word, onely hee bit ſome ſpeeches betweene his teeth wee could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
                  <p>We did nothing but laugh at him the reſt of the day, but at night there
had like to have happened a great misfortune for it; for <hi>Melintus</hi> going from
our houſe very late with my brother, to goe lye together, as many times they
us'd to doe, they were ſet upon by twelve or fifteene men, againſt whom
they ſo valiantly defended them, being both a horſebacke, that after they
had kill'd foure of them, the reſt were put to flight. The dead men were the
day after knowne for ſouldiers of <hi>Toxaris</hi> that was Provoſt of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and an
intimate friend of <hi>Garamant.</hi> This <hi>Toxaris</hi> had ſeem'd to be a lover of <hi>Ergina,
Melintus</hi> ſiſter, but he was expell'd the houſe of <hi>Telephus</hi> by <hi>Melintus,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
becauſe he could not endure him for the robberies hee did himſelfe, in
ſtead of hindering others from committing them. Nevertheleſſe, they could
neither accuſe <hi>Toxaris</hi> nor <hi>Garamant</hi> for this attempt againſt my brothers and
<hi>Melintus</hi> life, for there was not left life enough in the men that remaind upon
the place, to get the truth out of them.</p>
                  <p>Two dayes after, <hi>Melintus</hi> and my brother receiv'd a challenge from theſe
two friends, who to revenge them for the affront they had receiv'd, would
joyne their quarrels together; and they knew they attended them alone out
of the Towne, in a place whither a young boy, that brought the paper, was
to conduct them. <hi>Melintus</hi> miſtruſted ſome treachery, and could not beleeve
that ſuch cowards as they were, were minded to fight with them ſo freely,
and without advantage: and yet that they might not ſeeme to recule, they
reſolv'd to goe thither with a deſigne to guard themſelves from foule play.
This boy leads them out of the City towards certaine hollow places, whence
ſtones were digged, and ſhewed them from a hill <hi>Toxaris</hi> and <hi>Garamant</hi> all
alone, in a place where there was no cauſe to feare there were any men hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
for it was in a plaine peece of ground, and they might eaſily marke eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that was farre off round about it. The youth ſaid to them, that now
they ſaw them, he had no more to doe with them, and retir'd himſelfe. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
advancing himſelfe a horſebacke as he was, to goe right to them, ſaw
the ordinary way to be croſs'd with trees and ſtones, and that there was but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7768:41"/>
one path to paſſe by, that was very neare to a quarry of ſtone: hee was in a
wonder at that, but <hi>Palamede</hi> without any more conſideration, thruſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his horſe towards the path, and <hi>Melintus</hi> was ſtrangely taken to ſee him
all at once ſinke, as if the earth had ſwallowed him, and nothing more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to his ſight but a great open gulph, into which <hi>Palamede</hi> was fallen with
his horſe. Inſtantly <hi>Melintus</hi> ran to the deſcent of the quarry, for one might
freely goe there being on horſebacke; and ſeeing foure ſouldiers that went
to cut my brothers throat, he ran to them, his ſword in his hand, and by his
cryes made them turne towards him, whileſt my brother came out of the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelling
of his fall, which by good fortune did him no very great hurt, and got
quit of his horſe that was dead of it. Already had <hi>Melintus</hi> ſtrucke downe two
of them at his feet, and incenc'd with fury to ſee ſo great treaſon, tooke him
to the two other, when <hi>Toxaris</hi> and <hi>Garamant</hi> arriv'd, that made him turne
face towards them, and at the ſame time my brother found himſelfe ready to
ſet upon the two ſouldiers that remain'd. I cannot relate all the particulars
of that combat, for they are both of them too modeſt to have recited what
proofes of their valour they gave: onely I can tell thee that my brother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
defeated thoſe ſouldiers, and <hi>Melintus</hi> pierced the two Traitors with
many wounds, they conſtrain'd them at laſt to take flight. <hi>Melintus</hi> would
not purſue them for leaving my brother that was afoot; and ſeeing one of
thoſe foure ſouldiers that ſtill breathed, hee made him confeſſe that all the
night they had prepar'd that hole with hurdles that were not underpropt but
with little ſticks, and that they had cover'd them over with earth, ſo as the
trap could not be diſcern'd: that after that they had broken the ordinary
way, to oblige them to paſſe by that corner. <hi>Melintus</hi> thanking the gods for
having deliver'd them from that Ambuſh, tooke up my brother behind him,
and leaving this wretch to breathe his laſt, they return'd into the City. My
brother was a while to be cur'd of a hurt he tooke of his fall, and ſince that
we heard no newes of <hi>Garamant</hi> or <hi>Toxaris,</hi> but that one told us they were
gone to a Countrey houſe, where they hardly ſcap'd dying of their wounds.
<hi>Palamede</hi> made me the relation of all had paſſed: and yet hee ſignified how
<hi>Melintus</hi> was not willing it ſhould be knowne, for feare the cauſe thereof
ſhould withall come to light and I am ſure his greateſt feare was, leſt I ſhould
be comprehended in the diſcourſe, well knowing how averſe I was to be
mingled in the City newes.</p>
                  <p>It came to paſſe a while after that <hi>Diocles</hi> reviving his ſuit for his ſonne,
oneday <hi>Palamede</hi> came to tell me in <hi>Melintus</hi> preſence, that hee thought my
uncle <hi>Dicearchus</hi> would at laſt agree to the marriage of me and <hi>Amyntas.</hi> This
newes put me to bluſhing, and made <hi>Melintus</hi> mute for a time: yet not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
my brother ſaw his amazedneſſe, he told me, that hee thought <hi>Amyntas</hi>
very happy: then he ask'd me, if I were well acquainted with him: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him, how I never deſir'd to enquire after him: being reſolv'd to ſhut
my eyes, and take what husband ſhould be given me. <hi>Palamede,</hi> that had a
minde to laugh, told me, you may by night well take him ſo, your eyes clos'd,
but I can tell you that by day he ſhall put you to no feare. <hi>Melintus</hi> that would
nor contradict him, ſayes to me, that without doubt hee was a very honeſt
man: Nevertheleſſe, this diſcourſe being ended, he went out, as I gheſs'd,
very much troubled: and ſince that, he was a good while without ſeeing me.
<pb facs="tcp:7768:41"/>
I conceal'd not my wondring at it from my brother, and he told me, he had
not ſeene him neither ſince I did; but that hee had heard ſay how <hi>Telephus</hi>
and <hi>Diocles</hi> that were ſo great friends were lately fallen out, and it might be
<hi>Telephus</hi> had forbidden <hi>Melintus</hi> to come to our houſe, becauſe of the ſuit <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocles</hi>
made for me with his ſonne: yet to enquire further into the truth, hee
went to ſee him. About night my brother came to tell mee, that <hi>Melintus</hi>
had beene ſtayed at home with a Fever, and for no other cauſe beſides. I
preſently imagin'd his ſickneſſe proceeded from nothing but the reſolution I
had expreſs'd to him for this match, for elſe hee would have ſent to advertiſe
my brother of it. Some dayes paſs'd on ſtill, in which <hi>Palamede</hi> told me that
he was better: and one afternoone he came to our houſe, where he found
no body but my brother and I; <hi>Palamede</hi> having ſome urgent appointment,
left us alone together, and then entring into diſcourſe with <hi>Melintus,</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
me but with certaine words that well ſhewed the preſſures of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
I told him, without doubt ſomething troubled him. Madam, ſayes hee
to me, I confeſſe there is ſome confuſion in my minde which I cannot be
rid of, but in telling you the cauſe of it; and yet there is ſomething that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
me alſo the diſcovery of it to you. I was ſomewhat amaz'd, thinking
he would have declar'd his love to me: for without all queſtion I had then
baniſh'd him my ſight for ever: nevertheleſſe I ſaid thus to him; Tis with
you to judge whether you ought to tell it me, or not; you know my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and your owne diſcretion. I added theſe laſt words, to take from him
the boldneſſe of diſcovering himſelfe; then hee anſwered mee; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraind,
Madam, to tell it you, though peradventure, as much honour as you
have done me, as much reaſon may you have to wiſh evill to me. I was more
afraid now than before, and angry that he went about to oblige mee never
to ſee him more; which made me ſay to him; <hi>Melintus,</hi> doe not then put
any thing to the hazard, but let us remaine in the ſtate we are in. He was well
aware of my feare, but yet he continues ſpeaking thus; I will now make an
expreſſion to you, Madam, how much I honour you, for I am going to put
my life into your hands, and after you ſhall know what I have to tell you, you
may make me happy, or deſtroy me when you pleaſe. I thought he had a plot
to put me thus into paine, and I would have wiſh'd he had not entred into
our houſe that day. I reparted to him, <hi>Melintus,</hi> I pray you tell me nothing,
leſt it may cauſe ſome miſchiefe to you, by this permiſſion I may grant you.
Then to ſettle me, he ſaid with a countenance more aſſur'd, I am certaine,
Madam, I ſhall not doe amiſſe in telling you it; nay, you will confeſſe, that
I was bound to it, and I will beleeve for my part, that you will doe mee no
harme, although I give you power enough: I know my ſelfe too well, and
you alſo, to be ignorant of that that might diſpleaſe you. Upon this aſſurance
I permitted him to ſpeake, and he began thus; Madam, I beleev'd I had a
father, but now I have none; or if I have one, I know not in what part of
the world he is at this time. Alas! ſayes I to him, what's become of <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus?</hi>
Madam, goes he on, he is well, but liſten, if it pleaſe you, to what I
have to tell you. He has had ſometime a difference with <hi>Diocles,</hi> wherein he
was not ſatisfied, and yeſterday when he went to his houſe to obtaine more
reaſon at his hands, he came backe in a great chafe, and taking me apart ſaid
to me; <hi>Melintus,</hi> I muſt of neceſſity reveale to you the greateſt ſecret that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7768:42"/>
concernes me, and your ſelfe too: I will never quit the affection I have to
you ſince you came into the world, but it is time that I quit the name of
your father, to diſcover your birth to you. Thoſe words, ſaid he, much
amaz'd me, but for my aſſurance, he replied; Courage, <hi>Melintus,</hi> I bring you
no illnewes; only heare with patience my diſcourſe: then hee continues.</p>
                  <p>Know that upon the end of the reigne of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour, all the
world being at peace, the <hi>Siracuſians</hi> enjoyed a full liberty: Nevertheleſſe
<hi>Hermocrates</hi> and <hi>Dicearchus</hi> had the greateſt authority in the City, being
both of them equall in power, and antiquitie of their Noble families: <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrates</hi>
was deſcended of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of the <hi>Epirotes,</hi> that drew his originall
from <hi>Achilles:</hi> for they ſay, that this Prince after many victories, having alſo
conquer'd <hi>Sicily,</hi> fell in love at <hi>Siracuſe</hi> with <hi>Coronis</hi> the only daughter of
<hi>Parmenides,</hi> that came of the blood of the ancient Kings of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who having
underſtood that <hi>Antigone</hi> was dead, gave leave that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> being a widower,
ſhould ſecretly marry his daughter, untill he were return'd out of <hi>Italy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he would not have it knowne ſhe was his wife, for leaving her to the
mercy of many enemies he left behind him in <hi>Sicily.</hi> But whileſt he gained
battells againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> he loſt <hi>Sicily,</hi> whither he could not afterwards
returne; and having beene forc'd after ſome loſſes to retire himſelfe out of
<hi>Italy,</hi> he attempted other conqueſts, and was ſlaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coronis</hi> had a ſonne by <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> but <hi>Parmenides</hi> durſt not let him be
knowne, becauſe the <hi>Siracuſians</hi> had rebelled againſt <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and choſen ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
King. He tooke upon him no other care the reſt of his dayes with <hi>Core<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
than to breed this ſonne, by putting him in minde of his royall birth; and
this Prince being come to age, was content to live a private life, becauſe of the
power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to whom his father had beene ſo dangerous an enemy:
and he would not ſo much as ſpeake to his brothers, fearing they might doubt
his birth: Nevertheleſſe in the warres he did very brave actions; and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants,
of whom was <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> have all of them beene inſpir'd with a
greatneſſe of courage worthy of that divine blood they came of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dicearchus</hi> on the other ſide was of the ancient race of that great <hi>Timeleon</hi>
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that had in times paſt ſetled his dwelling at <hi>Siracuſe</hi> with his wife
and children, whom he brought from <hi>Corinth,</hi> after he had expell'd all the
Tyrants out of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and defeated the power of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in many
battells.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dicearchus</hi> therefore and <hi>Hermocrates</hi> in all reſolutions for the publique
were ever of contrary opinions, and had their factions apart. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> was
of a turbulent diſpoſition (pardon me, ſayes he, Madam, if I uſe the ſame
termes <hi>Telephus</hi> us'd) and ſpar'd for no policie to maintaine himſelfe, and
exceed <hi>Hermocrates</hi> in credit. <hi>Hermocrates</hi> was more moderate, and more
truſted in his approved honeſty, and the glory he had gained by his actions
of warre under <hi>Germanicus,</hi> affecting no other advantage in the City, but
what his predeceſſours had acquir'd for him. But <hi>Dicearchus</hi> jealous of the
reputation he had, and not able to endure an equall, ſtudied the meanes to
ruine him. One day having got together what armes he could find, he
made them be carried by night over the walls into <hi>Hermocrates</hi> garden, and
diſpos'd in rancks, as if they were to ſerve upon an occaſion. That ſame
night he advertis'd the chiefe of the City, that <hi>Hermocrates</hi> had ſome
<pb facs="tcp:7768:42"/>
attempt. They purpos'd to enter his houſe betimes in the morning, to ſee
what was done there, where having found all thoſe armes, they attached him,
and carried him into the fortreſſe, then they held a counſell, to reſolve what
they were to doe with him. The greater part knew well it was but a plot of
<hi>Dicearchus,</hi> there being no colour, that one private man ſhould make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
a tyrant of ſo great a City, that was at that time under the government of
<hi>Claudius,</hi> who reigned in the greateſt ſtrength and tranquillity of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Emperour. The people that loved <hi>Hermocrates</hi> began to mutine againſt his
accuſers; which <hi>Dicearchus</hi> perceiving, he was of opinion to ſend the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that ſuppoſed crime to the governour of the province: but the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſians</hi>
would never ſuffer that, for feare injuſtice might be offer'd <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates;</hi>
and alleging the privileges they had maintained, to be Judges in ſuch
affaires, they would themſelves take knowledge of the cauſe: Nevertheleſſe
not daring abſolutely to abſolve him, leſt <hi>Dicearchus</hi> might complaine of
them to the governour, they aſſembled in the afternoone, and were content
to baniſh him for five yeares according to their ancient law of <hi>Petaliſme,</hi> that
was made againſt ſuch as affected tyranny. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> not willing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
the people, made as if he were ſatisfied to ſee him abſent; and fifteene
dayes after <hi>Hermocrates</hi> was forc'd to depart the City with <hi>Enphroſine</hi> his
wife, that was neere her time of delivery, and certaine of his friends, in which
number was <hi>Diocles</hi> and I, ſayes <hi>Telephus,</hi> to goe to <hi>Lylibeum,</hi> and from thence
to embarke for <hi>Carthage.</hi> I have heard ſay indeed, ſayes I to <hi>Melintus</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
him, that <hi>Diocles</hi> and <hi>Telephus</hi> were of a contrary party to my uncle
<hi>Dicearchus.</hi> So goes the report, ſayes he and then replide; <hi>Telephus</hi> added,
how <hi>Hermocrates</hi> left his country he had ſo loved, with teares in his eyes:
and carrying away with him the beſt of his moveables, bequeath'd the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of all the goods he had in <hi>Sicily,</hi> to <hi>Diocles,</hi> and ſuffering him to
goe but one dayes journey with him, they parted: but <hi>Telephus</hi> willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
him as far as <hi>Lylibeum,</hi> about evening <hi>Euphroſine</hi> fell into her paines
of child-birth, and was at night brought to bed of a ſonne, which about the
place of his heart, was found to have the marke of another heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hermocrates</hi> ſent with joy the newes to <hi>Diocles,</hi> and withall advertis'd him
of this mark; and not willing afterwards to expoſe this infant to the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
of the ſea, prayed me, ſayes <hi>Telephus,</hi> to carry him back to <hi>Siracuſe,</hi>
and bring him up as my owne, ſtaying till the end of his baniſhment; beſides
he ſaid, he was very glad he was borne in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and ſhould there alſo be bred.
I accepted, continues <hi>Telephus,</hi> this intreaty with joy. O gods, ſayes I, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
<hi>Melintus,</hi> what great ſuſpitions doe you put into me, concerning
<hi>Diocles, Telephus,</hi> and your ſelfe; and what a change of things are theſe newes
likely to breed. Madam, ſayes <hi>Melintus,</hi> you are not much amiſſe, then hee
goes on. <hi>Telephus</hi> told me, that after he had ſtaied ſome time at <hi>Lylibeum,</hi>
while <hi>Euphroſine</hi> might endure the ſea, he tooke this little infant, and return'd
to <hi>Siraouſe,</hi> where finding his wife <hi>Hyperia</hi> that in like manner was delivered,
but of a dead child, he ſuppoſed this in the ſtead, for feare he might dye with
griefe, when her loſſe were told her; which thing ſhe ſoone beleev'd, and
they nam'd him together <hi>Melintus.</hi> At that word, Ah the gods! <hi>Melintus,</hi>
cried I out, can it be poſſible? Madam, ſayes <hi>Melintus,</hi> I wonder not at your
ſurprize, becauſe mine was farre greater than when <hi>Telephus</hi> pronounc'd this
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7768:43"/>
name to me; and added: Since that, my wife hath alwayes bred you as her
owne ſonne, and your ſelfe can tell alſo, if I have ſpared any thing to have
you be inſtructed in what ever might adorne your birth. And what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> ſayes <hi>Melintus?</hi> Since his embarking, anſwer'd <hi>Telephus,</hi>
we have heard no newes of him, nor did he then land at <hi>Carthage;</hi> and now
<hi>Diocles</hi> thinking him dead, and not knowing what you are, hath uſurp'd all
your eſtate. I did often tell him, how he ought not to make any ſuch pretence,
and yet never letting him know who you were. And now a few dayes agoe,
ſeeing how by meanes of his riches, he ſought <hi>Dicearchus</hi> neece for his ſonne,
I went to adviſe him, not to diſpoſe of any thing to the prejudice of <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
and his ſonne that was living: but he did but mock me, and demanded
if I pretended not a part in that eſtate, for the acquaintance I had of it: that he
would keep it well all to himſelfe, and that I ſhould not be credited, though I
had a mind to reveale any thing. I went away, ſaid <hi>Telephus,</hi> calling him a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
man, and aſſuring him the truth would come to light. To day, having heard
how he advanc'd his affaires continually, and taking no care of that I had told
him, I return'd to him, and prayd him to beleeve, I was no lyar, and that hee
would repent him of branding himſelfe with ſo great an infidelity. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
his mockeries with ſo much pride and ſcorne, that I was reſolv'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
to you your fortune, that together we might adviſe of the meanes how
to oppoſe the enterpriſes of this man, and the deſignes hee hath to retaine
what belongs to you. I was, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> ſo confounded at ſo many ſtrange
accidents that I was uncapable of conſidering what counſell were beſt to bee
taken. Nevertheleſſe I told him, that if theſe things were true, I ſhould never
want a heart to challenge my right; that he would give me ſome time to <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
thereupon, for it was to be proceeded in with as much prudence as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.
Having approved my advice, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> I told him, I would never
leave calling him my father, and honouring him as if he were ſo, for the great
obligations I had to him; and he did alſo confirme to me all the aſſurances I
could deſire of his friendſhip; ſwearing to me, that if I could have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Diocles,</hi> he would not faile to divide his eſtate betweene his daughter
and me, as before I beleev'd he would doe: nevertheleſſe, that with the care
we were to uſe in the buſineſſe, he hoped the gods would doe me juſtice. By
this, continues he, Madam, you ſee how I was oblig'd to advertiſe you of what
I have beene told. I hope I have not offended you, unleſſe it were in ſpeaking
of <hi>Dicearchus</hi> in the termes were us'd by <hi>Telephus.</hi> And you ſee how I put my
life into your hands: for if <hi>Dicearchus</hi> comes to know that I am the ſonne of
him he loved not, it may be he will ſeeke my ruine; but you may diſpoſe of
me as you pleaſe. On the other ſide, if I be to declare my ſelfe, I make me e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
not only to <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> but <hi>Diocles</hi> alſo, and all thoſe of their party: but
I will not feare any of theſe difficulties, if you ſhall thinke it fitting I declare
my ſelfe. <hi>Hormocrates</hi> ſonne, of whom we have heard the people ſpeake with
ſo much ſorrow, and appeare to be deſcended of that illuſtrious bloud of <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi>
and <hi>Achilles:</hi> and yet before I expreſſe my reſolution to <hi>Telephus,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to make a ſuit to you, that I might know your purpoſe: for if you intend
to marry <hi>Amyntas,</hi> never ſhall any beſides you heare more of my fortune: the
eſtate I leave to him, will be but the meaneſt loſſe I ſhall make in his proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
I demand your counſell therefore, Madam, in what I am to doe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
<pb facs="tcp:7768:43"/>
you to let me know what you reſolve concerning that marriage, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
you to ſatisfie what command you ſhall ordaine me, although it were a
forbidding me to live any longer. <hi>Epicharis,</hi> continued <hi>Ariana,</hi> I ſweare to thee
I was confounded with aſtoniſhment and joy, to ſee him advanc'd to a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
higher than I could have beleev'd; but withall I admir'd his generoſity,
with the love and reſpect he had to me, and ſaid to him, <hi>Melintus,</hi> if I find you
true, you may aſſure your ſelfe, I will never marry an uſurper of your eſtate:
Live in as great aſſurance as ever; <hi>Dicearchus</hi> ſhall beare you no ill will, for
that knowledge I ſhall give him concerning you. I am too much obliged to
your freedome, to hurt you: I am but troubled with you, for the faſhion you
are to uſe in behaving you in the midſt of ſo many enemies. Madam, ſaies he,
that's the leaſt care I have, ſeeing you ſo favourably entertaine my ſecret, and
I hope it ſhal be one day ſo well confirm'd to you, that you wil not repent you
to have done ſo many favors to a perſon of my condition. <hi>Melintus,</hi> ſaies I to
him, the knowledge you give mee of your illuſtrious birth, addes very
little to the eſteeme I had of you already: and you expreſſe ſo much
confidence in mee, as I am thereby obliged from henceforth to have
as much intereſt as you your ſelfe in all that may concerne you: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
I wiſh you to reſolve of nothing without me, concerning the carriage of
your ſelfe, ſo much part will I take in all thing ſhall arrive to you. Hee
was ſo tranſported for this teſtimony of affection, that hee tooke the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to kiſſe my hand in ſtead of thanking me; that was the firſt favour hee
obtaind of me, and the onely I have ſince that permitted him: then we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
to let ſome time paſſe, during which many things might be cleared. To
aſſure him, I ſware to him, that I would never marry <hi>Amyntas;</hi> and in the
meane time we found it very expedient that <hi>Telephus</hi> ſhould not diſcover him,
and that he ſhould make what friends he could to ſtrengthen himſelfe, which
would be no difficult matter. Above all, that he ſought the peoples good will
(wherein a few dayes ſince he had a very favourable occaſion, having obtaind
of the Emperor the exemption of Tributes) and that when all things were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd,
they might accuſe <hi>Diocles,</hi> and verifie the birth by thoſe witneſſes <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephus</hi>
ſhould bring; then to demand of him the evidences of the goods he had
uſurped, which would be impoſſible for him to ſhew. He proteſted he would
follow my counſell, and gave me ſuch paſſionate thanks for the care I took of
his fortune, that it was impoſſible for me to reſiſt ſo much affection; and from
that time, without ever making love one to another, we were aſſured that there
was not ſo perfect a one as ours. We thought it beſt, not to let <hi>Palamede</hi> know
any thing, becauſe of his too forward nature, that would with all violence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
himſelfe for <hi>Melintus</hi> againſt <hi>Diocles,</hi> which we judged unneceſſary: <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
made <hi>Telephus</hi> conſent, not to diſcover him yet, and told him hee was
aſſur'd, that <hi>Palamede</hi> knew well how to hinder his ſiſters marriage: for me, I
let <hi>Amyntas</hi> know that I was not reſolv'd to marry yet this yeere, and that he
ſhould take heed he made no propoſitions thereof before; wherein he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to obey me. Afterwards the occaſion being preſented of the Ambaſſage
to <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Syracuſe, Palamede</hi> had a minde to that voyage and I made <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
reſolve to accompany him, upon the aſſurance I gave him privately, that
in his abſence there ſhould paſſe nothing to his prejudice: beſides, I told him,
he might find occaſion to ſerve his Countrey, and get a reputation with the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7768:44"/>
Ambaſſadors by his counſels and interpoſitions. In all which thou haſt heard
what good ſucceſſe befell him, and what honours he had receiv'd at his return
into <hi>Sicily,</hi> if fortune at this preſent had not beene ſo contrary to him.</p>
                  <p>Thou ſeeſt then, <hi>Epicharis,</hi> whether I truſt thee or no, in revealing to thee
the ſecret of <hi>Melintus,</hi> and mine; but I deſire the gods would ſend him no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
misfortune, but that I feare might happen to him by thy indiſcretion.
<hi>Epicharis</hi> had bin ſo attentive to all this diſcourſe, and ſo raviſh'd with hearing
ſo many ſtrange paſſages, that ſhe ſeem'd to have loſt the uſe of her ſpeech:
but then ſhe began to ſay, Madam, I thinke I never receiv'd ſo much content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as in hearing your diſcourſe, as well for having underſtood ſo pleaſing
relations, as for the confidence you have in mee. I aſſure my ſelfe, that ſuch
faire fortunes as yours, and ſuch vertuous affections, ſhall not have ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
an end, as that you feare: and the honour you doe me, obliges me to
undertake any thing that may conduce to yours and <hi>Melintus</hi> ſervice. Alas!
<hi>Epicharis,</hi> replide <hi>Ariana,</hi> I can hardly ever expect to ſee him in a place where
I may reſolve of any thing to his advantage, or where thou mightſt be able
to ſerve us. Madam, ſayes <hi>Epicharis,</hi> raiſing up her ſelfe, I beſeech you to
ſuffer, that this very houre I may expreſſe the paſſion I have for you. What
canſt thou doe, anſwers <hi>Ariana?</hi> He has left you, ſayes ſhe, <hi>Arcas,</hi> and given
him charge not to abandon you: Give mee him in exchange, and give mee
leave to ſtay in this Countrey to learne what may become of them, to aſſiſt
them, and ſend you newes of them. How, ſayes <hi>Ariana,</hi> canſt thou be able to
doe any thing, being but a wench, and beſides that, all alone in the Country?
Madam, replied ſhe, the diſgrace that fell to me by the burning of my haire,
ſhall much advantage my deſigne. I will diſguiſe my ſelfe in a boy, and this
night 'twill be eaſie for me to eſcape from you in the wood, when you are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
parting. <hi>Epicharis,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ariana,</hi> thou art too couragious; I feare thy labour
will be but unprofitable, and in the meane time I ſhall bee deprived of thy
company and conſolations. Madam, ſayes ſhe, I have taken this reſolution,
and ſhould remaine here againſt your will, if you would not thinke it fitting:
but I beſeech you to give your conſent. <hi>Ariana</hi> at laſt accorded to that device,
and ſeeing there yet remain'd day enough, before they could depart, they
fell both of them aſleepe.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Riſtides</hi> not knowing the deſigne of <hi>Epicharis,</hi> after hee had
ſlept a while, conſidered upon all the reſolutions were to bee
taken in this diſaſter: one while he would have return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi>
to defend his ſonnes cauſe, if hee were in the hands of Juſtice,
and to move compaſſion both with the Judges and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
On the other ſide, hee would not carry his daughter thither, nor yet
let her goe alone into <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Nero</hi> had ſuch deſires to her. At laſt,
knowing it was neceſſary for him to follow <hi>Arcas</hi> his advice, and to goe out
of <hi>Italy,</hi> where they ſhould not faile to be alwayes purſued, he could not be
comforted for abandoning his ſonne in ſo great a hazard of his life: and yet
he determin'd to leave ſome one in the Countrey, that might adviſe of means
to aſſiſt <hi>Melintus</hi> and him, and keepe them from any misfortune. Hee found
none ſo fit for this, as <hi>Arcas,</hi> and intreated him to take the employment on
him: but he aſſur'd him, he had no greater deſire than to doe this ſervice, but
that he had oblig'd himſelfe to <hi>Palamede</hi> by an oath, not to forſake them till
they were in <hi>Sicily;</hi> and therefore this commiſſion muſt be given to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Ariſtides</hi> choſe out the moſt adviſed of his ſervants, that was call'd <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi>
and having inſtructed him concerning the wayes he was to take, in caſe
they were retained by order of juſtice, hee gave him as much money as hee
could ſpare: and when the night came, they prepar'd to depart. <hi>Ariana</hi> in
like manner gave in ſecret to <hi>Epicharis</hi> ſome jewels ſhee had, to ſerve her
turne when ſhe might have need of money: and all of them taking their
journey in the by-wayes of the Foreſt, under the conduct of <hi>Arcas</hi> that had
taken view of the paſſages of it, in a little time they ſoone found themſelves
in the Champaigne, from whence they began to ſee and ſmell the ſmoake of
the City that ſtill burnt. In the midſt of this horror, they gave not over tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
on towards <hi>Oſtia,</hi> and a while after <hi>Ariſtides</hi> comming neare his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and miſſing <hi>Epicharis,</hi> ask'd her where ſhe was. <hi>Ariana</hi> anſwer'd him, ſhee
thought ſhe follow'd them: they ſought for her amongſt the company, and
not finding her at all, <hi>Ariſtides</hi> imagin'd ſhee lov'd <hi>Hermes,</hi> and leaving the
company had eſcap'd to follow him. <hi>Ariana</hi> ſaid, ſhe had not that opinion of
<hi>Epicharis,</hi> but that ſhe was wandred about the wood, and making as though
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7768:45"/>
ſhe were in gteat trouble for her, ſhe deſir'd they might goe back againe to
ſeeke her. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> being in a rage, ſwore he would leave her ſince ſhe might
eaſily have followed the company, if ſhe had would; and what ever diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<hi>Ariana</hi> ſhewed, he would no longer delay the time, for this maid. Some
return'd the way they had come, but not having found her, they did all conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
their journey together. Being happily arriv'd at <hi>Oſtia,</hi> they ſaw a man that
brought newes, how two <hi>Sicilians</hi> were taken, and accus'd for ſetting <hi>Rome</hi>
on fire, and that they were now priſoners; This a little eas'd their mindes, to
know they were living: and yet they left not to have many feares for them; but
hoping in their innocency, and not able then to give them any other remedy,
they imbarck't in the ſhip that had beene ſtaied for them, recommending
<hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Melintus</hi> to the gods, and paſſing the ſtraight betwixt <hi>Reggium</hi>
and <hi>Meſſina,</hi> that ſeparates <hi>Sicily</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> landed ſafely at <hi>Syracuſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they were ſeene to arrive without <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Melintus,</hi> and
their misfortune was knowne, there was a publike mourning for it, for they
were both of them very well loved of the people: and the conſideration of
<hi>Dicearchus, Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Telephus,</hi> with the good will that all in particular
bare to theſe two friends, made the chiefe men of the City reſolve to ſend in
their favour an Embaſſie expreſſe to <hi>Nero</hi> and the Senate, to make a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of their innocence, and obtaine favour at their hands, endevou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to reſtore to <hi>Melintus</hi> the benefit they had received from him when
he procur'd the exemptions. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> deſir'd to be chiefe of theſe Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
and they haſtened away becauſe there was no time to loſe; but when
they had paſſed to <hi>Reggium</hi> to goe by land to <hi>Rome,</hi> they met there with
<hi>Hermes</hi> that told them theſe deadly newes; how <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Melintus</hi> having
beene examin'd a few dayes ſince, and ſeeing how they were ready to be
condemn'd by the expreſſe commandement of <hi>Nero,</hi> were willing to prevent
a ſhamefull death, and had caſt themſelves downe into the Tyber from the
top of the tower where they were priſoners. This aſſurance he gave them,
turn'd their journey back againe, and repaſſing to <hi>Meſſina,</hi> they arriv'd by the
ſame way they came, at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> where they poſſeſt all with ſadneſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtides</hi> tore his haire, and accus'd himſelfe for having abandoned his
ſonne: and his griefe was ſuch, that a very little while after it brought him
to his grave. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> reſented this calamity in loſing the deareſt hopes of
his houſe. <hi>Telephus</hi> was touch'd with as great an affliction for <hi>Melintus,</hi> as if
he had beene his owne ſonne, but nothing was able to equall <hi>Ariana's</hi> griefe;
who under the pretext of her brothers death, lamented beſides the death of
<hi>Melintus</hi> with the bittereſt teares that love ever caus'd to be ſhed: ſo as all
places ecchoed with her plaints. Alas, ſaid ſhe, now is the time I am certaine
of my miſery. Miſerable <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſerveſt for a monument to my deareſt
pledges, and muſt thou againe triumph over us? and muſt the injuſtice that
reignes with thee bring to ruine ſo vertuous an innocency? O gods I how
long will you ſuffer this cruell tyranny? why ſwallow not you up that wicked
nation? or why theſe latter dayes did you not let them be devour'd in the
flames they had prepar'd for us, for to puniſh them by their owne villany?
Alas! there was left enough of that wretched people to deſtroy the goodlieſt
friendſhip that ever was. Deare brother, I ſhall never ſee you more, and not
<pb facs="tcp:7768:45"/>
ſeeing you, I ſhall never more ſee what I held moſt deare in the world. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
voyage, diſaſtrous counſell I gave my brother, to goe ſee a City that
ſubſiſts not, but for the ruine of all things: for ſince the time he came neere
it, what a traine of miſeries have we had experience of? and what blind fury
lead us one after another, to goe ſeeke out misfortunes at their fountaine,
and the place where vice and crimes are reigning with ſo much power and
inſolency? at leaſt, when I was there arriv'd, juſt heavens, why did you not
let me periſh in the fire with them, without making me ſurvive the ſole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the world that made my life happy to me, and deſirable?</p>
               <p>This faire Lady diſſembled not ſuch griefes as theſe in all companies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the cauſe of them was attributed to the great deareneſſe that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
her brother and her: but her greateſt ſorrow was, for not having any
body to comfort her, and diſcover her moſt ſecret griefes to. She enjoy'd not
now <hi>Epicharis,</hi> nor her ſweet conſolation: yet ſhe had a little hope left ſtill,
as long as ſhe heard not the certainty of their death from the mouth of that
wench. She inquir'd privately of <hi>Hermes,</hi> if he had not ſeene her, and he
told her, how he had help'd to diſguiſe her, that they both went into <hi>Rome</hi>
together, that he had counſell'd her to goe find out <hi>Maximus,</hi> and the reſt of
the friends <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> had, and ſince that he had heard no newes
of her; and this put her into more trouble for <hi>Epicharis,</hi> whoſe adventure had
beene thus.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Ariana</hi> were gone out of the wood, ſhe had acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Hermes</hi> with her purpoſe, for being well aſſur'd of him, to the end he
might wait for her at the ſame place, when ſhe ſhould have withdrawne her
ſelfe from the reſt, foreſeeing what need ſhe might have of him, both for
getting out of the foreſt, as to get clothes, and adviſe together of the meanes
how to helpe <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Melintus:</hi> ſhe abſented her ſelfe a little from the
troope, after ſhe had kiſs'd her deare Miſtreſſe, and embrac'd her: then ſhee
went to find <hi>Hermes,</hi> that cut the reſt of her haire for her, and in the morning
when they were at the woods end, ſhe bethought her to ſend him to buy her
clothes at <hi>Rome,</hi> and learne what they ſaid there. She ſtaied a long time for
him, and to the middle of the day, for it was foure miles journey from
thence: in the end he return'd, and brought her clothes, which ſhe fitted,
and dreſt her ſelfe in as well as ſhe could, and hid her owne. He told her, the
brute ran, they had taken two ſtrangers, that were accus'd for having ſet
<hi>Rome</hi> on fire: they imagin'd it was <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Melintus,</hi> and the ſame
houre mounted a horſe-back, and went forward on the way. <hi>Epicharis</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving
at <hi>Rome,</hi> was forc'd to ſtay at the gates, for the multitude of thoſe that
came out, all in teares and lamentations for their loſſes: Nevertheleſſe taking
reſolution, ſhe entred amongſt the confuſion of ſo many wretched perſons,
ſome carrying what they were able to ſave, others mourning their children
and kindred burnt, and ſome there were in the company alſo, that bare
away what they had pillaged in that diſorder, and all was full of cries and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult.
It was no hard matter for her to goe unknowne in that trouble: ſhee
deſir'd <hi>Hermes</hi> to lead her horſe to be ſet up ſomewhere, then advis'd him to
goe to <hi>Maximus</hi> his and their Maſters friends to ſet them in employment
for their deliverance. As for her, enquiring after the priſon, ſhe went to ſee
it, and about evening ſhe ſaw comming out of it an old man with a youth,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7768:46"/>
and ſhe knew they were the Jayler and his ſonne. She followed them, to ſee
whither they went, and what they ſought, then as the night approach't, ſhee
diſcern'd them to enter under <hi>Livia's</hi> porch, where there were great ſtore of
people walking. This good man was ſpeaking to his ſonne, as if he had his
minde very fixt upon what he ſaid, and the ſonne ſtaying to ſee ſome contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
as the towne was then full of contention, <hi>Epicharis</hi> perceiv'd the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
went on his way, and ceas'd not his diſcourſe, thinking he ſtill ſpake to
his ſonne, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> much did his buſineſſe poſſeſſe him. She ſubtilly join'd her to
him, and going the ſame pace, heard all the old man ſpake, who not thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
he had any other by his ſide, but his ſonne, ſaid in continuing his
diſcourſe: Thou maiſt well conſider, that the men they brought us yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
ſeeme to be perſons of quality, that we are carefully to looke to. We
cannot both of us provide all things; I have need of one to call them up, and
to lye in their chamber. I will ſee, if the man I was told would ſell himſelfe
at the entry of <hi>Iſis</hi> Temple, be fit for my turne, and will give himſelfe at a
cheape rate. <hi>Epicharis</hi> had much adoe to hold from laughing at the Jaylers
miſtake, and was glad to know his deſigne, then ſeeing his ſonne comming,
ſhe got away from him, without being perceiv'd, becauſe of the darkneſſe;
and ran in all haſte to the entry of the Temple, where ſhe found a young man
ſitting, whom ſhe ask'd if he were to ſell himſelfe: he confeſt to her, that he
was there for that purpoſe; ſhe quickly agreed with him on the price, and
giving him a peece of money, ſaid to him, goe thy wayes, and ſtay for me
neare <hi>Minerva's</hi> Temple, from thence I will bring thee to my Maſters houſe:
He went his way well ſatisfied, and preſently came the Jayler, with his ſon,
who finding <hi>Epicharis</hi> ſet, diſguis'd into a man, ask'd her if ſhe were the man
that would ſell himſelfe. <hi>Epicharis</hi> told him, ſhe waited there for no other
occaſion. They look'd well upon her, and finding her according to their
minde, began to cheapen her, and although they offer'd but little, ſhe agreed
to it, upon condition ſhe might redeeme her ſelfe for the ſame ſumme. That
was taken very reaſonable, and the Jaylor willing to give her the money, ſhe
praied him to keepe it, becauſe ſhe had no where to put it. The good man,
pleas'd at her freeneſſe, brought her to the priſon, and by the way inſtructed
her of all ſhe had to doe: wherein ſhe promis'd to ſerve him faithfully; and
ſhe call'd her ſelfe <hi>Eurylas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They entred about the time <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamedes</hi> ſupper was carrying
in, and preſently they gave <hi>Eurylas</hi> a plate to ſerve with, who comming into
the chamber, and getting neare <hi>Palamede,</hi> trod upon his foot, for feare he
ſhould be ſurpris'd in ſeeing her; then he did as much to <hi>Melintus.</hi> They
ſuſpected, advice was given them of ſomething, but they knew her not for
all that; therefore ſhe reſerv'd the diſcovery of herſelfe till the night, when
ſhe ſhould be alone in the chamber with them. The time being come that
they were to goe to bed, ſhe was left to wait on them, and lock'd into that
chamber, with lights: then beginning to looke upon them, and ſmile: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
men, ſaid ſhe, ſpeaking but low, doe you not vouchſafe to know
thoſe that run ſo much hazard for your ſakes? Alas! ſaid <hi>Palamede,</hi> tis <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charis:
Melintus</hi> knew her alſo. Deare <hi>Epicharis,</hi> replide <hi>Palamede,</hi> have I ever
deſerv'd, you ſhould bring your ſelfe into this danger for me, and would have
embrac'd her: but ſhe gently thruſting him away, ſaid to him, I pray you
<pb facs="tcp:7768:46"/>
doe not take a recompence in ſtead of giving me one for the ſervice I do you.
<hi>Melintus</hi> advis'd to put out the candell, for feare they were ſeene, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he demanded her newes of <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Ariana,</hi> and if they had ſav'd
themſelves; ſhe ſaid ſhe thought they had: then reported the reſolution ſhe
had taken, to diſguiſe her ſelfe for their ſervice, in exchange of <hi>Arcas</hi> that
would not be perſwaded to quit <hi>Ariana;</hi> that <hi>Hermes</hi> had beene left by
<hi>Ariſtides</hi> to aſſiſt them; but that ſhe had loſt him, after giving him advice to
employ <hi>Maximus</hi> and his friends for them: and ſhe told them after that how
ſhe had abus'd the Jaylor to get into that priſon. They admir'd the pretti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of her wit, and the luck whereby the old man was couzened, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to husband well that good fortune: Above all they were of opinion
not to ſpeake at all one to another by day, but to put their conferences off till
night, left ſhe might chance to be diſcover'd. She inquir'd how they had
ſcap'd killing in the incounter of the Souldiours that tooke them, ſince there
were ſo many dead in the place. I ſwear to you, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> that they had
too much feare to put us into deſperation, and that we ſhould not ſtill kill
ſome more of them: wee were glad to yeeld us, after we had fought it out to
the very laſt, and ſince that they uſed us very unworthily, till we came into
this very priſon, where we are to be kept while the fire be wholly quench'd,
and the Senat may aſſemble to take knowledge of the crimes we are accus'd of.
We are, ſaid ſhe, to endevour to get out from hence before they have that lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and I for my part ſhall not be ſlow in finding out the meanes: but, ſayes
<hi>Palamede,</hi> taking her by the hand, I have cauſe to thinke well of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
that hath given me this benefit, to make her lye in the ſame chamber
with me, for whom I have had ſo many longings. <hi>Palamede,</hi> ſaid <hi>Epicharis,</hi> if
I have ſo freely put my ſelfe into your hands, take no other advantage of it,
beſides the teſtimony I give you of an honeſt deſire to ſerve you, for if you
abuſe this my freedome, I ſhall know how to puniſh you well enough, and
my ſelfe too, for having obliged an indiſcreet man. She ſpake theſe words
ſomething in paſſion: but <hi>Melintus</hi> ſaid to her, No, no, <hi>Epicharis,</hi> I ſhall be his
ſurety, aſſure your ſelfe, <hi>Palamede</hi> has not ſo loſt his judgement as not to
know what reſpect wee are to beare to your ſex, and honour to your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
She knowes that well, replies <hi>Palamede,</hi> if I be not deceiv'd in her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and if I honour it. I have beene ſufficiently inſtructed to my coſt, how
I ought to live with her, and learn't more diſcretion in her company, than
my wit hath ſeem'd capable of: Nevertheleſſe ſhe knowes withall, that I muſt
alwayes be jeſting. Theſe occaſions, ſayes ſhe, permit no jeſting; content
your ſelfe, that I love you as my Maſter, and <hi>Melintus</hi> as my brother. <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
admir'd her vertue, and gentileneſſe, and gave her many thanks for the
good will ſhe had for him, without any obligation of his part to have ever
moved her to it. <hi>Melintus,</hi> ſaid ſhe, you are of more worth than all my ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
give me leave only to doe for you what I am able, and for this time doe
me the favour to let me ſleepe, for I had never ſo much need of reſt. <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
intreated her to take their bed for her ſelfe alone, becauſe it was more
commodious than her owne; but ſhe would never conſent to that, and went
into another very little one that was made ready for her, after ſhe had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to remember ſhe was called <hi>Eurylas,</hi> and no more <hi>Epicharis.</hi> They
promis'd her to have care of it, and then they all three held their peaces to go
ſleepe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:7768:47"/>
The next day ſhe aroſe before them, and went to make acquaintance with
all of that obſcure houſe; then having underſtood there were ſome <hi>Romans</hi>
come, that deſir'd to ſpeake with the two friends, ſhe went to them to know
what their deſires were. They ſignified to her, they were come to offer them
their goods and ſervices. <hi>Epicharis</hi> went to aske the Gaoler if ſhe ſhould let
them in, but he ſaid that was expreſly forbidden, and ſhee made anſwer to
them, that it was not poſſible to ſpeake with them; but how they were beſt
to employ themſelves with the Senators, to make their innocence appeare to
them, and what the actions of their life paſt had beene; which they promis'd
to doe, and went their way, after ſhe had knowne the lodging of ſome of them
to make uſe thereof if need were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> in the meane time, that waked long before <hi>Palamede,</hi> entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the conſideration of his good fortune, and commended this accident, for
making him receive ſo deare an expreſſion of <hi>Ariana's</hi> affection, as to ſend
her faithfull <hi>Epicharis</hi> to aſſiſt him with her brother, when ſhee could give
them no helpe her ſelfe. He doubted not of eſcaping that danger, ſeeing
himſelfe ſtrengthened with ſuch a helper, and ſpent all his thoughts in the
remembrance of <hi>Ariana,</hi> and the fortune of his loves, which he found to be
in a very happy condition. For although he might thinke ſhee had not ſent
this maid but for her brothers ſake, yet he found this action to be too gentile,
and too generous to proceed from a ſimple friendſhip, and not rather to be
a Love-invention: and then reſting him upon that meditation, he ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
himſelfe, And dare I alſo to pretend to ſo much happineſſe? and can I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
preſumption beleeve that ſhe loves me? for if I beleeve her altogether
perfect, I am to be perſwaded that ſhe hath an excellent judgement: and with
what vanity can I hope ſhe ſhould thinke me worthy of her? and yet becauſe
her judgement is ſo perfect, ſhe knowes to what degree my paſſion has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
and peradventure ſhe will have the perfection of my love be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the greatneſſe of her deſert. Should I then be ſo happy, that for this
reaſon ſhe had found nothing in the world, beſides me, worthy of her? that
ſhe had ſeparated me out of the number of all men to be made choyce of?
and that in her ſoule ſhe had kept her to that choyce? Pleaſing, but too am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
thoughts, whither doe you lead me? are you ſo bold, to compare me
to this Divinity, that nothing was ever yet comparable to? where are your
reſpects, and your feares? Let us continue in a ſubmiſſion, and not expect
her grace but by adoring her, and not in equalling our ſelves to her. But is
not this againe to wrong the perfection of my love to abaſe it in humility, in
ſtead of acknowledging the beauty and greatneſſe of it? Things that are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
to this degree, are of a glory too tranſcendent to ſuffer contempt of us;
they will be admir'd, and confeſs'd to be as divine as they are indeed. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
my love, I had rather let thee alone than offend thee: equall thy ſelfe,
if thou beeſt willing, to ſo many merits, 'tis by thee alone I have hope: It
may be this faire ſoule loves thee already, and embraces thee, taken with thy
perfection; and if wee doubt of this, let us continue in the beleefe that is
more fitting for us, and at leaſt not give over the contentment of hope.</p>
               <p>Theſe delightfull fancies entertain'd him with great pleaſure, when all on
a ſudden he felt himſelfe embrac'd of <hi>Palamede,</hi> who ſaid to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pardon,
<hi>Epicharis;</hi> alas! <hi>Epicharis,</hi> I aske you pardon. <hi>Melintus</hi> embrac'd him in like
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7768:47"/>
manner, and ſpake to him that he might continue this diſcourſe hee made in
his ſleepe; but <hi>Palamede</hi> awaked, and confeſt to <hi>Melintus,</hi> that he dreamt hee
was taken by <hi>Epicharis</hi> making proteſtations of love to <hi>Camilla;</hi> and that hee
fell downe at her knees to cry her mercy. Then looking about in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and ſeeing ſhe was gone out, he continues, There is no doubt but the
love of this wench comes alwayes to challenge the place it had in my ſoule,
what ever lightneſſe may poſſeſſe me: for I loved her before I went to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
where you are a witneſſe how many Miſtreſſes I ſerv'd: at our returne
from thence to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> I had no ſooner ſeene her, but I was more ſubjected
to her than before time: being come to <hi>Rome,</hi> I loved <hi>Camilla,</hi> and you have
ſeene how coldly I made uſe of thoſe advantages you obtaind for me, ſince
ſhe arriv'd there with my ſiſter; now ſhee covers my wound more than ever,
by the care ſhe takes of us, and by a thouſand pretty devices her wit is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
working. For my part, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> I cannot thinke her borne of a
ſervile condition; ſhe has too many faire qualities for ſo wofull a birth: and
I vow to you, I ſhall never blame your affection for being carried away with
ſuch perfections. I doe not beleeve you would ſo much injure thoſe you come
of, to pretend to marry her; and you are not alſo to deſire any thing of her,
that might offend her honour; but my opinion is, you will alwayes love and
honour what is remarkable in her, being able to ſay with you, that I have ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
found a perſon more lovely. I confeſſe to you, anſwered <hi>Palamede,</hi> that
I oftentimes have theſe very thoughts, and I flatter them beſides with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
hope, that the time may come that ſhee may appeare extracted from
ſome family that might be no diſhonour to me, ſo much doe I wiſh, that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
might accommodate her ſelfe to my deſires. Is it poſſible, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi>
that <hi>Dicearchus</hi> ſhould not learne of the Pyrats where they had taken her?
Never, ſaid he, did my uncle tell us what he knew concerning her; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he has ever made her be bred otherwiſe than a ſlave, and as if hee had
knowne her to be come of free perſons; nay, one day when there was a
ſpeech of marrying her to <hi>Aſylas</hi> a young ſlave borne in the houſe, hee could
not refraine to ſay; The gods would never pardon me for mixing her bloud
with one ſo unworthy of her. That ſpeech more engag'd me to love her, and
I ſhall make a relation to you how I let my ſelfe be taken. You cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
anſwers <hi>Melintus,</hi> what intereſt I have in her fortune, and what pleaſure
you ſhall doe me in repeating a little of her life to me. I am going then, ſayes
he, to tell you what hath paſs'd betweene us. And he proceeded thus:</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Hiſtory of Palamede and of Epicharis.</head>
                  <p>I Cannot tell if I be to account my ſelfe happy, or unhappy for the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I am ingag'd in for her, not finding any poſſibility of poſſeſſing her,
neither as a Miſtreſſe becauſe of her vertue, nor as a lawfull wife becauſe of
her condition: but I will leave you to judge in this caſe, after I have made
you the hiſtory of our loves. You muſt know then, that <hi>Epicharis</hi> being
brought up very carefully under <hi>Acidalia</hi> wife to <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> and from day to
day making her ſelfe more conſiderable for her beauty and ſweetneſſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
was loved of this young <hi>Aſylas,</hi> who was but of a ſimple and heavy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of wit: but yet finding that he was of ſome credit in the houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7768:48"/>
he was ſonne of <hi>Cromis</hi> and <hi>Menalippus,</hi> two ſlaues that had under them
the whole government of <hi>Dicearchus</hi> houſhold affaires, and that <hi>Epicharis</hi> was
very well belov'd of their Maſter and Miſtreſſe; he thought he could doe no
better deed than to pretend to marry her, and firſt of all he reſolv'd with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to get her good opinion of him: but ſhee that had a ſenſe of her noble
heart, could not endure ſuch a wooing as that, and us'd him alwayes very
contemptuouſly.</p>
                  <p>One day I went into <hi>Dicearchus</hi> garden, and was ready to fall aſleepe in a
cabinet ſhadowed over with leaves, when I ſaw her comming very neare that
place with a purpoſe to gather flowers. I was already ſufficiently taken with
her affection, and had not failed to have gone to intercept her, but that I was
prevented by <hi>Aſylas,</hi> who ſeeking opportunity to ſpeake to her, had now
made his addreſſe; nevertheleſſe with feare, and in a faſhion ſimple enough,
offer'd himſelfe to gather thoſe flowers for her ſhe deſir'd. She thank'd him,
and ſaid ſhe tooke pleaſure in gathering them her ſelfe. 'Tis rather, ſaid hee,
becauſe you refuſe my ſervice. Have you, anſwers ſhe, a ſervice to beſtow?
Yes, replies he, which I make you preſent of. You give, ſayes ſhe, that is none
of your owne, and I give it you againe for feare I be accus'd of theft: And
why ſo, replies he? becauſe, ſayes ſhe, your ſervice belongs to the Maſter we
ſerve, and I will make no pretence to it. He ſtayed a while there, becauſe hee
was not ſo prompt at a returne, and then anſwers, Although I am his, I can
preſent you with ſomething that is mine owne. With what, ſayes ſhee?
with my heart, anſwers he: and how will you doe, replies ſhe, to give it me?
You demand ſtrange things, ſayes he, what needs you know that? For all
that, ſayes ſhe, it were reaſon I knew it, and ſtill gather'd her flowers as ſhe
ſpake. This young man knew not where to have his heart come out, to
make her a preſent of it; and I perceiv'd ſhe would be going, having made
her poſie; which made me come out from the place where I was, to ſtay her.
She bluſh'd for ſhame that ſhe had beene heard all that diſcourſe; and <hi>Aſylas</hi>
getting afarre off us, out of reſpect, I ſaid to her, Gentle <hi>Epicharis,</hi> I love
you, for thus uſing perſons ſo unworthy of you: She anſwered me, becauſe
we ſerve the ſame Maſter, he beleeves all things are equall with us, but this
difference there is, that he is a ſlave by nature, and I by fortune; for nature can
never be changed, but fortune may give me the liberty ſhe hath taken from
me. If there wants nothing, ſaid I to her, but a liberty to be given you to
make you happy, I offer you mine: And what would you be then, anſwer'd
ſhe? Your ſlave, ſaid I. And what, replies ſhe, ſhould cauſe that change? The
love I beare you, anſwers I. I would be very willing, ſayes ſhe laughing, to
make this exchange, ſo you will tell me what I am to doe. You are to love
me, ſaid I to her. How is this, replies ſhe; you ſay love makes us loſe our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
ſo I ſhould be ever returning into my firſt condition againe. It were
better, anſwered I, we parted all betwixt us, ſo we ſhould have but one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
for us both, and one ſlavery onely. We ſhould, ſayes ſhe, find it a great
trouble, to know which of us were to be maſter. Let us be ſerious, ſaid I to
her, <hi>Epicharis,</hi> I love you with a paſſion, and deſire you alſo to love me ſo. I
will ſpeake as ſeriouſly to you, ſayes ſhe; <hi>Palamede,</hi> I honour you with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
and deſire you to ſeeke nothing elſe of me: then leaving me, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a minde to laugh, ſhe added, I am going to <hi>Acidalia,</hi> if you be willing
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7768:48"/>
to goe on with this diſcourſe, you are but to take it up againe, when I ſhall
be with her. When ſhe went her way, I continued ſome time immoveable,
being rapt with the gentileneſſe of her diſcourſe, and reſolute to love her in
earneſt, having a good hope ſhe would let her ſelfe be overcome. To this end
I never gave over making her what aſſurances of my affection I could, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the time we were together in the Countrey one day at my uncles, when I
thought there requir'd but an occaſion that were found favourable, to have
her wonne at my intreaties, and the opportunity of the place. I went one
morning to take her in her bed, where I found her faſt in a ſweet ſleepe, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with one arme upon her head, which her ſmocke without all care had
left all naked to my ſight, and the other careleſly ſtretched upon the bed, but
yet in ſuch a faſhion that it kept her from being eaſie to be uncover'd. Her
boſome, that this way of ſleeping gave repoſe to, and breathing at eaſe, was
not cover'd but with the end of the ſheet that by chance met there; the reſt
was very modeſtly compos'd. I ſtood confounded to ſee her ſo handſome; for
it ſeemed, her eyes in deſpight that they were not open, for ſecuring her from
me, pierc'd through their lids to wound me, ſo ſtrangely did I feele my ſelfe
moved. And yet not ſatisfied with what I ſaw, I ſoftly uncover'd all her neck;
but I vow to you, <hi>Melintus,</hi> I never ſaw any thing ſo faire. I could no longer
containe my ſelfe then, but bringing my mouth thither, I preſs'd her a little
more than I ſhould have done, and made her wake. That was a ſtrange ſpring
of hers ſhe gave, when ſhe ſaw her ſelfe betweene my armes at her awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and with eaſe delivering her from me, becauſe I would not anger her at
this firſt encounter, ſhe inveloped her ſelfe in her ſheets; and after blaming
my boldneſſe for comming into her chamber while ſhe ſlept, prayed mee to
goe out: then aſham'd to loſe ſo faire an occaſion, I put my ſelfe upon her
bed, and embracing her, urg'd her by all the prayers I could deviſe, to eaſe
my affection; and in this while I put her to a little paine, hoping to obtaine
what I deſir'd by a ſweet violence: but ſhe after ſome reſiſtance, at laſt lift
her ſelfe up, and ſaid to me with a confident looke; <hi>Palamede,</hi> I beleeve you
are not ſo unreaſonable as to have a thought to take that by force from mee
which is the deareſt thing I eſteeme in the world: it may be you hope I will
be vanquiſh'd with your importunities, but know this, that there is no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
ſo cruell, as that I ſhall make choyce of for you, and then for my
ſelfe too after the loſſe of my honour; my condition hath diminiſh'd nothing
of my courage, let it ſatisfie you therefore to have attempted this, the crime
is great enough to go no further; and I ſhall never pardon you while I live, if
you leave me not now preſently in as much repoſe as I was in when you found
me. If you goe on in this vile intent, your labours will be but all in vaine, nor
ſhall the difference of our fortunes keepe me from having your life, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of your indiſcretion. She ſpake theſe words with ſo ſevere a faſhion,
that I had no heart to preſſe her any more. I beſought her to excuſe the rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of my love, and would not let her alone, till ſhe had pardon'd me. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
I had alwayes a great opinion of her vertue, and was not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to doe her all the ſervices I was able, untill I went my voyage to <hi>Athens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I proteſt to you, ſayes <hi>Melintus</hi> breaking him off, I am greatly delighted
to heare ſuch generous demonſtrations of a courage: doe but conſider a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7768:49"/>
while, how vice ſerves to advance vertue: for there is no doubt that without
that wicked deſire in you to attempt upon her honour, you could never have
knowne to what height ſhe had brought that honour. I will avow to you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Palamede,</hi> that ſince that time I reſpected her as much as ſhe had beene
the moſt noble of our condition; and the more practice I had with her, the
more I obſerv'd qualities in her, that could not proceed but from a good birth,
as you ſhall underſtand by this that followes. Then he goes on.</p>
                  <p>Before my depart for <hi>Athens,</hi> I was aware that <hi>Epicharis</hi> ſeeing my over-free
humour chang'd into a reſpect, and my violent paſſion into a vertuous love,
had alſo ſomewhat moderated her too great rigour, to oblige me with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
friendſhip, and no occaſion to ſerve me was preſented, but ſhe perform'd
it with a great deale of care; but ſo modeſtly withall, that I could not imagine
it were to gaine me any way beſides. It ſeem'd onely, that ſhee expreſt to
have ſome obligation to mee for the affection I had to her: and during my
voyage, I continually receiv'd proofes from her, that ſhe remembred me. At
my returne I had a great contentment, when I knew my uncle meant to give
her to my ſiſter; and the day ſhe was to part out of his houſe, I went thither
to ſee her: but at my entrance I perceiv'd in a corner the poore wretch <hi>Aſylas</hi>
buſie at a great reckoning, to which he was ſo attentive, that he ſaw me not;
he had a little booke he was looking in: then he counted one while with his
fingers, another with caſting counters, but I well ſaw he could not make his
account right. At laſt I had pitty of him, and ask'd him what hee did. Hee
was aſham'd to be taken at that occupation: nevertheleſſe, I offered my ſelfe
in ſo good faſhion to helpe him, that he deſired me to count for him. It was
a number of yeares, wherein there were many dayes to be added, and many
alſo to be taken away: but I had a minde to know what the meaning of it
was. He confeſt to me, that after he had a long time ſought the good graces
of <hi>Epicharis,</hi> at length he could obtaine of her nothing elſe, but that after ſix
yeares ſervice ſhe might receive his affection; and how moreover they had
put into the agreement, that according to the quantity of the ſervices, ſhee
might take away ſome of the daies, and in like manner ſhe might adde to them
as ſhe pleas'd, if he did any thing to diſpleaſe her, either wilfully or by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune;
that for this purpoſe he made uſe of the little booke to keepe a true
account withall: and now <hi>Epicharis</hi> was going to dwell out of the houſe, hee
would ſee in what eſtate affaires were. I began to laugh within my ſelfe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſimplicity, and this device of <hi>Epicharis</hi> wit to mocke him. When I
had therefore comprehended his meaning, I look'd into the booke, and ſaw
how every day that paſs'd was taken away, and that ſometimes there was
writ, for one ſervice foure dayes to be diminiſh'd: but by and by after was
ſet downe in another hand, for not ſaluting with a good grace, ten dayes to
be added; for ſpeaking indiſcreetly, fifteene dayes; and all that was to bee
augmented ſo, was written with <hi>Epicharis</hi> hand. I refrain'd from laughing as
well as I could, and after a true ſupputation, I found that he had ſtill above
eight yeares to ſerve, and there were two paſt already, ſince they made the
bargaine. When I had ſtayed his account, and he ſaw himſelfe ſo farre back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
he could not chooſe but weepe: I comforted him what I could, with a
promiſe ſo to uſe the matter with <hi>Epicharis,</hi> that ſhee might oftentimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
the dayes for my ſake. But he ceas'd not weeping, and ſaid he ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:7768:49"/>
not find out ſo many occaſions more to ſerve her; and I anſwer'd him, there
ſhould not be ſo many occaſions neither to diſpleaſe her.</p>
                  <p>After I had ſomewhat reſtor'd him againe, I went to tell this encounter to
<hi>Epicharis,</hi> with whom I laugh'd a good while at <hi>Aſylas</hi> affliction, for finding
himſelfe ſo backward in his account. She confeſt ſhe had invented this way
to rid her of him, and for merry paſtime when ſhe deſir'd it. But in the end
I ſaid to her, And for mee, how many yeeres will you ordaine mee? There
needs many, ſaid ſhe, becauſe it may be you would often find the meanes to
oblige me, and I ſhould feare you would never doe any thing to diſpleaſe me.
If that were ſo, anſwer'd I, you ought to wiſh the terme might ſoone end, to
poſſeſſe him that would not diſpleaſe you. Looke you then, ſayes ſhe, there
muſt be ſome other perſon beſides me to make you happy; but I ſweare to
you alſo, I ſhould never give my ſelfe to any leſſe than you. And if fortune
reſtores me not to a higher condition, you may be aſſur'd no man ſhall ever
enjoy me in that I am now in. The greateſt of my deſires is come about,
that I may live with the divine <hi>Ariana</hi> your ſiſter. 'Tis with her I will end
my dayes in the height of felicity. I ſweare to you, <hi>Melintus,</hi> that hearing her
ſpeake with ſo great a heart, I knew not what it was kept me backe from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her by violence out of my parents hands, to give her liberty, and marry
her after: but knowing ſhe her ſelfe would never conſent to that, for feare
of angring <hi>Dicearchus, Ariſtides,</hi> and <hi>Ariana,</hi> I did nothing but augment my love
by the experience of her vertue.</p>
                  <p>Some time after, ſhe pleas'd me againe ſo well, that I was neere upon the
loſing of all reſpect or conſideration. I beleeve you were then in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
with <hi>Telephus,</hi> when my ſiſter made a dance of Egyptian women. I have
heard, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> of ſomething there was done in my abſence, which I
ſhall be glad to heare of. You know, replies <hi>Palamede,</hi> how <hi>Epicharis</hi> ſings
and playes on the Lute very pleaſantly. We were all aſſembled at my uncle
<hi>Dicearchus</hi> his to receive this Maſque; I ſaw her enter with three other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
in the number of whom was my ſiſter, and when the noyſe was appeas'd,
ſhe recited theſe verſes in Muſicke:</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>FOure Siſters we be come from Egypt together,</l>

                     <l>Mankind for to command.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Now ſeene ſhall it be if any of this City</l>

                  </lg>
                  <p>I was one of the neareſt of the ſpectators, and ſo rapt with ſeeing and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7768:50"/>
her, that I had loſt the uſe of my other ſenſes, to make happy thoſe of
ſight and hearing onely; which made me I tooke no heed when one of theſe
Egyptians put her hand into my pocket in the meane time, and tooke away
what I had there.</p>
                  <p>When the recite was ended, and the dance following it, they that ſaw I
was robbed, made ſhew to looke if they had loſt nothing by theſe ſhe-robbers.
I did as much, and inſtantly cried out that I had beene robbed, and ran to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picharis</hi>
to intreat her to give me againe what they had taken from me; then
to my ſiſter and the reſt of them: but they all denied the theft, and I had no
newes of it till the next morning, when I ſaw comming into my Chamber a
young boy I knew not, that brought me what I had loſt, with a little paper,
wherein were writ theſe words:</p>
                  <p>The Egyptians are content to let you ſee that they know how to get more than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

                  <p>I urg'd this young childe to tell me who ſent him, but he would never be
knowne of it; and all I could get of him, was to give me leiſure to make

                  </floatingText>
                  <p>All theſe Gentileſſes gave me intirely to her; and yet ſince that time I ſerv'd
her with a great reſpect, becauſe the commodity at our houſe being the fitter
to make attempts upon her, I perceiv'd that ſhe did the more refraine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
her good will towards me, for feare I might not take the more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
but I confeſſe to you, that what ever intreaty ſhe made mee, I never
left commending in my minde her carriage. My ſiſter was very well pleas'd
with my affection, knowing this wench to be very diſcreet, and was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſhe would find the way to moderate my over-haſty humour, if I tooke
pleaſure in obeying her. She alwayes therefore us'd me very ſeriouſly: but
one time when I aſſur'd her of the love I had to her; And may I, ſaid ſhee,
have ſome proofe to confirme it? I was amaz'd, and glad withall ſhe deſir'd
ſome ſervice at my hands, and made offer of all I was able to doe to pleaſe
her. Know, if it be poſſible, ſaid ſhe to me, of <hi>Dicearchus</hi> what my birth is,
for I beleeve certainly hee knowes it: 'Tis not that I am weary of living as I
doe, for to ſerve <hi>Ariana</hi> I would forſake the moſt free condition of the world:
but I ſhould have cauſe to rejoyce in waiting on her ſervice purely out of
good will, and not out of neceſſity. I commended her deſire, and promis'd
to uſe all the intreaties I could to that end: then I added, would to God, my
faire maid, our conditions might in ſome faſhion meet one with another; I
ſhould have as much cauſe to joy at that perſwaſion, as you your ſelfe: for I
beleeve I ſhall never have power to diſpoſe of my ſelfe, untill I ſee what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
ſhall have reſolv'd of you. I will not, anſwer'd ſhe, make any profeſſion
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7768:50"/>
to you, how much I am oblig'd to your affection, for that were unuſefull;
but if ever the ſtate of my life may change, you ſhall finde I will not forget
the leaſt of your reſpects. I prayed her to beleeve I would alwayes ſerve her
after that manner; and proffer'd my ſelfe, in caſe my uncle gave me no light
to know what ſhe were, to goe to the fartheſt parts of the world, that I might
learne the truth of it. But when I had put <hi>Dicearchus</hi> upon that diſcourſe, I
could never draw any clearing of the queſtion from him. He told me indeed,
that he had her of the Pyrats upon the Sea coaſt towards <hi>Camarine:</hi> but that
made me never the wiſer, and I was very angry for having underſtood no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe to ſatisfie <hi>Epicharis</hi> deſire. Preſently after the occaſion of going to
<hi>Rome</hi> was preſented, and when I bade her adiew, ſhe ſaid; Take heed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
upon the Sea make not you of my condition, and by equalling you to
me, ſeparate not us both for ever. I would willingly, ſaid I to her, redeeme
your liberty and my contentment at the charge of foure yeeres ſervitude; I
could have no greater wiſh than that it were my chance to ſerve your kindred
in recompence of the ſervices you have rendred mine. Oh gods! how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
ſhould I be, if in the end I might come to the knowledge of them, and
give them intelligence of the place you are in, for to make us both free by a
happy change: It would never grieve me to endure neither yrons, nor the
cruelleſt tortures of ſlaves, to obtaine ſo great a good. Theſe are ſpeeches, ſaies
<hi>Melintus</hi> interrupting him, very powerfull and affectionate for ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull
man as you are; for you were no ſooner here but you forgat all
thoſe proteſtations to love <hi>Camilla.</hi> I beſeech you, replies <hi>Palamede,</hi> doe not
reproach me with that; for the affection I have for <hi>Epicharis,</hi> ſeemes to be a
ſtrong and ſure paſſion that keeps ever one direct courſe, letting paſſe a-croſſe
it thoſe little lightneſſes without being moved, and I hope it ſhall alſo one
day attaine the end it hath pretended to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Palamede</hi> would have finiſh'd what remain'd to be told of that depart, when
<hi>Epicharis</hi> entring, brake off their diſcourſe; and finding them ſtill in bed, ſhe
accus'd them of ſlothfulneſſe: <hi>Palamede</hi> in laughing told her, they had but
too much time for the journey they were to make that day. Then ſhee told
them what ſhe had done with their friends: As for <hi>Maximus,</hi> although he had
reaſon to be ill ſatisfied with them, for the detriment he had ſuffer'd for their
ſakes, having ſav'd himſelfe alſo from the fire after them, with much trouble,
and though he had enough to conſider of his owne affaires, yet hee had not
failed to promiſe her all ſorts of aſſiſtances for them: that the fire was not yet
out in the City, but yet they ought not to loſe the occaſions that were offer'd
to ſave themſelves; that it would be eaſie for her to bring them a very ſmall
cord, wherewith they might draw up a great rope ſhee would have without
the Tower, which ſhe now had all in a readineſſe of an exceſſive length, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the height of the Tower was very great. There was no other difficulty
but for them to get to the top of that Tower, for being alwayes cloſe ſhut up
in their chambers. Three or foure dayes paſs'd on ſtill in their deliberating
upon ſome meanes, whileſt the burning continued alwayes. But they were
ſurpriz'd one morning, being ſent for to appeare before the Senate. <hi>Epicharis</hi>
was in deſpaire for having delayed ſo long to invent a meanes for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and feared they ſhould be that very day condemned. <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamede</hi>
in leſſe trouble, were brought before the Senate, where entring with a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7768:51"/>
modeſt aſſurance, they were ſet upon ſeats very low to the ground: The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull
having commanded the accuſers to ſpeake, <hi>Martian</hi> goes out from the
company, becauſe he was a party in this cauſe: and then they were accus'd
with much vehemency, for having by an abominable practice ſet fire on <hi>Rome,</hi>
and to be the cauſe of the greateſt ruine and deſolation that City ever ſuffer'd;
that not content with that horrible impiety, they had added the murthering
of <hi>Marcelin</hi> and many others, whereof proofe was made by <hi>Marcelins</hi> ſword,
that <hi>Melintus</hi> was found ſeiz'd of, and for that he was taken all bloody. For
theſe crimes it was concluded by the accuſer, that they deſerv'd the cruelleſt
puniſhments that were. <hi>Melintus</hi> ſeeing that no body preſented himſelfe for
them, demanded permiſſion to defend himſelfe; and having obtain'd it, hee
was a while looking downe to the ground to thinke of what hee had to ſay;
then lifting up his eyes towards the Senators, he ſpake thus:</p>
                  <p>MY Lords, if I were to ſpeake before Iudges that were leſſe equitable than you,
I ſhould have great cauſe to feare the oppreſſion of our innocence. I conſider
the authority of our accuſers, all the City of <hi>Rome</hi> animated againſt us, and (if the
crimes they ſuppoſe us guilty of were true) you your ſelves, my Lords, intereſſed by
your loſſes to puniſh us. Againſt all theſe powers, may two ſtrangers, forſaken of all
things, pretend to defend themſelves? Nevertheleſſe, we doe not eſteeme our ſelves
altogether deſtitute, having in heaven the gods for witneſſes of our life, and upon
earth the juſtice we are in hope to finde amongst you. We have nothing but the truth
for our defence; and this truth being naked and ſimple, I will alſo make you a ſimple
relation of our misfortune, whoſe cauſes may very eaſily be juſtified.</p>
                  <p>Being arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> for no other end but to behold her glories, and make our
ſelves knowne for perſons deſirous of the beſt things, wee entered, to our miſery, into
the acquaintance of <hi>Marcelin,</hi> who after he had made us great profeſsions of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
in the end conceiv'd a cruell jealouſie againſt us for a womans ſake, and reſolv'd
to kill us. Thoſe that knew him can tell if hee were capable of ſuch a practice. One
night we were ſet upon by a number of men that left us for dead, and had it not beene
for the ſuccours of <hi>Emilia</hi> and <hi>Camilla,</hi> before whoſe houſe the noyſe was heard, wee
ſhould have had no mere paine to defend our owne lives. <hi>Camilla</hi> will be a witneſſe of
this truth, and all her houſe, whither we were carried; who will tell alſo, how <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celin</hi>
not beleeving we had knowne his treachery, ſent <hi>Palamede</hi> an oyntment that
was found to be ranck poyſon. Nevertheleſſe wee adviſed to diſſemble and abſent us
from hence, having ſuch an enemie. Since that, <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> father to <hi>Palamede,</hi> being
come hither with his daughter <hi>Ariana,</hi> upon the rumour of his ſonnes danger, <hi>Marce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
fell in love with <hi>Ariana,</hi> and had a purpoſe to marry her: But <hi>Palamede</hi> having
him in deteſtation as his mortall enemy, and <hi>Ariana</hi> ſhunning him as the murtherer
of her brother, his love contemned turn'd into rage, and knowing we were upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to returne into <hi>Sicily,</hi> he plotted our death, but the cruelleſt one that could bee
imagin'd by him. Becauſe he would not let us be gone without a revenge, he encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with armed men the houſe of <hi>Maximus</hi> where we liv'd, and then ſet fire to it on
all ſides, having reſolv'd either to burne us there, or kill us at our comming out when
we had no other thought but how to ſave us from the flames. They of <hi>Maximus</hi> houſe
can witneſſe how they ſaw theſe furious men ſetting fire with Torches in their hands,
and that two ſlaves were killed going to fetch water at the Tyber. For mee, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
with my ſelfe to take a horſe and ſave mee by running through flames and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7768:51"/>
ſwords. <hi>Palamede</hi> did the like; but tooke another way than that I went. <hi>Marcelin</hi>
ſeeing himſelfe on foot, and that I went farre away, made a horſe be given him to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
me, and overtooke me being all alone, where furiouſly aſſaulting mee, I had the
good fortune to kill him, though he were armed. Two others came upon me, that were
left upon the place. After that <hi>Palamede</hi> rejoyning him to me, we were taken, when
we had a long time defended our ſelves; and now we are accus'd for the death of theſe
men, and for having ſet the City on fire.</p>
                  <p>They that have beene here acquainted with us, know, if we could everſo much as
have conceiv'd ſo deteſtable an enterpriſe: what fury muſt we have beene poſſeſs'd of?
and what ſtrange ingratitude had that of ours beene, to have had a minde to deſtroy
this great City, whereof we have had the honour to be made Citizens, and for whoſe
glory we have ſo often fought? But beſides, what likelihood is there we would have
begun at our owne lodging, being ſhut up within, with what wee had moſt precious,
and from whence we had much adoe to preſerve us? For the murther, tis very true that
I defended myſelfe from a man armed, that ſought my life, which I ſecured after
from two other men, and ſome ſouldiers: There is nothing more juſt than to repell
force with force: But in all this, what hath <hi>Palamede</hi> done? having beene aſſail'd
by night, he was there left for dead: he ran a danger of being poyſon'd: ſeeing the
houſe on fire where he was, he got out to ſave himſelfe, and came to finde me againe,
not knowing what ſhould become of him after the loſſe of his father and ſiſter: and
he now is accus'd together with me for a murtherer and fire-ſetter, in ſtead of the juſtice
we were to demand for having beene fired and aſſaſſinated. All theſe things being able
to be juſtified, I implore, my Lords, not your pitty, but your juſtice: not that cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
that hath made you ſo often pardon your greateſt enemies, but the integrity of
this Auguſt Senate, that nothing could ever yet weaken. Or if our misfortune deſerves
any puniſhment for having beene the cauſe, without our intention, of the diſaſter of
<hi>Rome,</hi> be affected with the compaſſion that is due to ſtrangers, to our youth, to our
innocence, and to ſo many wounds receiv'd for the honour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. And
if there muſt needs be ſome ſacrifice offered to the peoples ſatisfaction, content your
ſelves with my life, and provoke not the gods againſt you by the condemnation of <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede,</hi>
the moſt innocent of all men.</p>
                  <p>After he had left ſpeaking, there was heard a little murmuring among the
Senators; ſome admiring the aſſurance and grace he had in ſpeaking, others
his generouſneſſe and friendſhip towards <hi>Palamede.</hi> The greateſt part of them
ſaid there was no appearance they were guilty. There were none incens'd
againſt them, but thoſe that had beene made by <hi>Martian.</hi> In the end the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull
made a ſigne to <hi>Palamede</hi> that he ſhould ſpeake, and with a feareleſſe faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he ſaid thus:</p>
                  <p>MY Lords, <hi>Melintus</hi> having repreſented to the Senate all I am able to ſay, for
making our innocency appeare, tis not againſt our accuſers I am to defend mee,
but againſt him. I complaine of him in the firſt place, for that he betrayes our cauſe,
by confeſsing us cauſes remote of the calamity of the City, and ſpeaking of ſacrifices to
offer up to the peoples deſire for to deliver himſelfe alone to death, and preſerve my
life. I accuſe him moreover for gainſaying the lawes of our friendſhip that made us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable:
and he is greatly in the wrong to affect by deſigne our diviſion, which could
not be excus'd but by diſaſter. If he were culpable, I ſhould be ſo too; but ſince he is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7768:52"/>
innocent, I pretend alſo to be ſo. I have alwayes ſo well labour'd to imitate him, out of
the knowledge I had of his vertue and perfection, that I feare not to be accuſed of his
faults, but thinke my ſelfe glorious to be found faultleſſe with him. There is nothing
belongs to us both that can be divided: our wils united make but one minde, which
ruling all our actions, it ſeemes we are in like manner but one body, ſo as there is but
one onely perſon you are to condemne or abſolve. And yet, if for cauſes ſeparate from
us, and to which our will hath contributed nothing, wee deſerve ſome puniſhment;
which of us can be ſaid to be more worthy of it but I? I am the ſole object of the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
of <hi>Marcelin,</hi> and of his hatred; <hi>Melintus</hi> had no controverſie at all with him:
To me alone he ſent the poyſon: I alone hindred his marriage with my ſiſter, I alone
provok'd his vengeance againſt us, which is the cauſe of all theſe miſeries. Onely <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
found himſelfe ingag'd in his treaſons, not thinking any thing, and ſo hath
committed nothing, whether by miſchance or by intention. I demand therefore we be
both of us ſent away abſolv'd as innocents; or that I alone be expos'd to the ſentence:
and you ſhall teſtifie by this judgement, the equity that makes you renowned through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melintus</hi> would have replied, but one of the Conſuls impos'd him ſilence.
Then all the Judges were in an admiration to ſee ſo perfect a friendſhip, and
moved with the conſideration of ſo much vertue and innocency, began to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
for their abſolution. They had beſides interrogatories given them apart,
and all their anſwers were found conformable: but upon theſe intermiſſions,
<hi>Nero</hi> ſent to command them to ſurceaſe the judgement untill he had written
his mind to them. So they were ſent backe againe to the priſon, where the
diſguis'd <hi>Epicharis,</hi> longing to know the ſucceſſe of the judgement, enquir'd
of them what had paſſed. But having knowne for what cauſe they were ſent
backe, ſhe began to appehend <hi>Nero's</hi> abſolute power, and went preſently out,
to goe enquire of one of <hi>Melintus</hi> friends, if the Emperour had ſince writ his
will to the Senate. He told her, the teares in his eyes, that hee came but now
from a Senator that told him the Prince would have them dye: Becauſe <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi>
during the judgement, had gone to kneele downe before him, and made
him promiſe they ſhould be puniſh'd by his authority.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Epicharis</hi> in deſpaire, return'd to bring them that ill newes: and being ſhut
cloſe together, they conſulted upon the danger they were in. She told them,
'Tis a ſtrange thing, that ſince I came in hither, I have not beene able to have
this good fortune to finde either invention, or occaſion to bring you out. For
me, ſaid <hi>Palamede,</hi> I will caſt my ſelfe downe from the top of this Tower into
the Tyber, rather than ſubmit to ſo ſhamefull a puniſhment. I would, ſaid
<hi>Melintus,</hi> we were but in poſſibility to precipitate us, there were then no more
deliberation to be us'd: for we ſhould ſoone find meanes to deſcend: the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of importance is, how to get to the top of the Tower. <hi>Melintus</hi> is in the
right, ſaies <hi>Epicharis,</hi> for the rope is all in a readineſſe, and I would quickly
bring you wherewith all to draw it up to you: And now I thinke on't, ſayes
<hi>Melintus,</hi> the height of this Chimney anſwers to the height of the Tower: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
midnight we may helpe one another, and get up to the Tower that
way; I beleeve we may ſave our ſelves, provided onely none know of your
going out, and that they ſhut not up ſome body elſe here in ſtead of you:
you muſt of neceſſity goe to buy a boat, with ſome other habits to diſguiſe us
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7768:52"/>
in, and when you returne, you ſhall bring us this ſame ſmall cord to draw up
the other from without to us. I find this, ſaid <hi>Epicharis,</hi> to be very well devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
and to make it ſure, that none inquire for me or for you this night, as ſoon
as I ſhall be gone out of this Chamber in the evening, you are but to ſhut the
doore with the barres, and they will locke you in, without looking whether I
be there or no. This being reſolv'd on in this manner, <hi>Epicharis</hi> went inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to provide her of a boat, ſome clothes, and the rope ſhe had caus'd to bee
made of a thickneſſe and length very ſtrange; having committed all theſe
things to the keeping of a young youth ſhe knew, and who little thought for
what purpoſe ſhe was to uſe them; ſhee came backe to bring the ſmall cord,
and advertiſe them how all was in a readineſſe. After ſhe had ſeene them ſup,
ſhe took her leave to goe to attend them at the foot of the Tower: preſently
they ſhut themſelves up, and about midnight when they might judge that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
body was aſleepe, <hi>Melintus</hi> tooke the ſheet that ſerved to their bed, and
deſir'd <hi>Palamede</hi> to get up firſt into the chimney, becauſe he might helpe him,
and carry with him this ſheet wherewith afterwards he might helpe to draw
him up: <hi>Palamede</hi> was hardly to be perſwaded, and would have done him that
office and ſtayed the laſt: But <hi>Melintus</hi> told him, theſe conteſtations were not
in ſeaſon, and ſo us'd the matter, that <hi>Palamede</hi> ſet his foot upon a ſtoole, then
upon his ſhoulder, and from thence by little and little got him up to the top,
carrying the ſheet by which he was to draw up his friend <hi>Melintus</hi> was not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
long in getting to him, though it were with ſome labour; then they threw
downe the little cord, to which <hi>Epicharis</hi> tyed the great one, and they drew it
up to them, and having bound it to a pinacle of the Tower with the little one,
ſo ſtrong that it was impoſſible it ſhould ſlip, <hi>Palamede</hi> ask'd of <hi>Melintus</hi> where
the honor was in that occaſion, to goe before or after; <hi>Melintus</hi> anſwer'd him,
they were rather to conſider of ſaving their honour and diſpatching them:
Doe you then paſſe firſt, replide <hi>Palamede,</hi> that your honour may be firſt ſav'd.
I will, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> make the retreat. Never, replide <hi>Palamede,</hi> ſhall it be ſaid
I left you in danger. Ha! anſwer'd <hi>Melintus,</hi> what ceremonies are theſe? we
conteſted before for getting up, and now we muſt loſe time alſo in deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
But, ſaid <hi>Palamede,</hi> why will you have mee alwayes give place to you in
affection? I will have you, continued <hi>Melintus,</hi> let your ſelfe goe firſt, then
you ſhall carry me downe upon your ſhoulders. Upon this condition, ſayes
<hi>Palamede,</hi> I will, and ſo tooke the rope: but <hi>Melintus</hi> let him goe, for it was
impoſſible for <hi>Palamede</hi> to ſtay himſelfe; and <hi>Melintus</hi> was thus willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, that he might ſee him part and know that his friends life were in
ſafety, before he thought of ſaving his owne. He had alſo received this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
but for the ſtrange accident that happened; for when <hi>Palamede</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the boat, the pinacle to which the rope was tyed, (whether it were
for being ſo old, or for the weight of <hi>Palamede's</hi> body, and the thickneſſe of
the very rope) was carried downe together with it; and if at the ſame inſtant
the boat had not gone off of it ſelfe, <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Epicharis</hi> had beene ſtruck
dead under the ruines of it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis hard to judge who were the moſt aſtoniſh'd, either <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Epicha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
that felt themſelves quell'd with the water this fall cover'd them with, and
to ſee the rope downe without all hope of helping <hi>Melintus</hi> any more; or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
himſelfe that thought they had bin ſmitten dead, and ſaw that hee was
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7768:53"/>
deprived of all meanes to ſave himſelfe. He was a while of the opinion that
nothing could now ſecure him from death, and he was abſolutely minded ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to caſt himſelfe downe the Tower, than remaine in the hands of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
And yet being of a courage that fear'd no danger, and wit that ſoone
invented preſervatives, he look'd about him, and perceiving the ſheet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he got up thither, he conſider'd if he might not cut it into many lengths,
to be tyed one to another; but all of it would ſcarce have reach'd to the
halfe part of the Towers height; but for all that he purpos'd to launch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
into the water from the extremity of it as farre off as hee ſhould be, and
tooke the end of the ſheet to begin to cut it; but a wind that aroſe very high,
had almoſt carried away his ſheet, and with it all his hopes. That made him
thinke of a meanes very ſtrange, and to ſeeke his ſafety by that which had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
neere loſt him. Having heard tell of ſome that had beene borne up in the
ayre by meanes of their clothes, and ſet downe upon the ground lightly, hee
advis'd with himſelfe, ſince the wind favour'd him, to make a ſaile of his ſheet;
and after he had made it ſwell with the wind to let himſelfe goe in it, by hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the ſheet by the ends, hoping that the wind would ſuſtaine him enough
from falling too faſt downewards. The worſt could befall him was to bee
drown'd, and he had rather loſe his life ſo, than by the ſtroke of a hang-man.
Conſidering therefore which way to accommodate himſelfe, and turning his
backe to the ſheet, he tooke behind two of the corners, wherewith he made
him as it were a girdle, which he faſtned before with that was left of the little
cord, and letting paſſe all the reſt of the ſheet over his head, he ſtretched out
his armes, and tooke the two other ends in his hands, which he tyed alſo, for
feare they might not chance to ſlip away, but yet in ſuch a faſhion, that hee
might eaſily undoe them: then putting himſelfe upon the pinacles in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to the wind, he made it fill up the ſheet, and this wind lifting him up
almoſt by force, he let himſelfe goe, recommending him to the gods, and felt
that he deſcended by little and little till he came below where <hi>Palamede</hi> and
<hi>Epicharis</hi> were, admiring by the light of the Moone this Engine, and not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
what it might be.</p>

leſſe, when entring into the boat, and ſeeing himſelfe helped
by them, he was aſſur'd that the fall of the pinacle had nothing
offended them. After the common rejoycings for eſcaping ſo many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
they were thinking how to avoyd that which remain'd, and reſolv'd to
depart the City by the ſame river, for not being apprehended. They went
downe the ſtreame very eaſily, till they came a good way off <hi>Rome,</hi> and about
morning they found themſelves foure or five miles diſtant from it. There
they quitted the clothes they had on, and having fill'd them with ſtones, caſt
them into the water; then they were of opinion to goe by land, and take a
way quite contrary to that wherein they were taken; for then following the
Tyber they had gone ſtreight to <hi>Oſtia;</hi> and if they were purſued, they would
not faile to ſearch along the River. It was therfore decreed they ſhould gaine
the haven of <hi>Cajetta,</hi> becauſe that of <hi>Reggium</hi> was too farre remote, and that
they ſhould not march but by night, for being in danger of taking the ſecond
time. <hi>Eurylas</hi> that had waſh'd him in the water, look'd ſo lovely in the new
clothes he was dreſt in, that <hi>Palamede</hi> was in paine to conceale the new
wounds ſhe gave him. And then when no body ſaw them, he help'd her to
goe, and ſometimes <hi>Melintus</hi> lead her; for <hi>Epicharis</hi> was not accuſtomed to
ſo great journeyes; and their deſire was to advance to ſome place where they
might paſſe away the day. And ſtill as they went, they entertain'd one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their adventures, and tooke it for a good fortune that the pinacle
fell, for elſe the rope had beene left there, which would have made them be
followed; but now the world would think they had precipitated them, their
comming out by the chimney being to be diſcern'd by ſome ſtooles they had
uſed to get up with. After they had gone a good journey in diſcourſing thus,
they arriv'd at a village, where they tooke with them ſomething to eat, and for
feare of being diſcover'd, continued their voyage: then they paſſed through a
great field to get them far out of the way, &amp; found a very retir'd place, where
there was a running brook, neere to which they ſat downe under the ſhade of
ſallowes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:7768:54"/>
After they had made their repaſt, they began againe to recount their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
together; and the feares <hi>Ariſtides, Ariana, Telephus,</hi> and all their friends
at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> were in for them; that for this occaſion they muſt not loſe time
in getting to <hi>Sicily,</hi> to leſſen by ſo much their diſpleaſures. That conſideration
made them reſolve to continue their march, which they did incommodiouſly
enough, becauſe they kept them altogether in by-paths, leſt they might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
upon the high-wayes. At laſt, about evening they arriv'd neere to a
houſe they judged very faire; <hi>Eurylas</hi> had a good minde to have beene there
receiv'd to repoſe him that night, and not to be ſo ill provided for, as to have
nothing but the heaven for a Canopy: but they thought it beſt not to put
themſelves to the hazard of falling into hands they could not afterwards
get free of; and ſeeing very neere that place a little wood, they purpos'd to
enter into it, and there to chooſe out ſome ſhady place; where when they
were ſet, <hi>Eurylas</hi> overcome with ſlumber and travell, preſently fell aſleepe:
the two others fearing to wake him, made no kind of noyſe, and that ſilence
inſenſibly made them ſleepe alſo.</p>
               <p>When they were in the depth of their ſleepe, a young Lady, Miſtreſſe
of the houſe they had ſeene, taking in the evening the freſh ayre of the wood,
paſſed very neere them as ſhe walk'd about. They could not be ſeene where
they were, of any that had beene in the walks of that wood: But <hi>Eurylas</hi>
turning him from one ſide to another, removed ſome leaves that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, and made a little noyſe. <hi>Corinna</hi> (this Lady was ſo call'd) curious to
ſee if it were not ſome beaſt, went ſoftly forward, and found the faire <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rylas</hi>
ſleeping in a faſhion ſo agreeable, that the ſight raviſh'd her: the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
and whiteneſſe of his complexion, his vermillion mouth, his browne
but fine and curled haire that hung over his ſhoulders, and above all the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
proportion of the features in his face, gave her too ſenſible impreſſions
to ſeeme her ſelfe inſenſible of them: for ſhe ſtood without all motion, and
ſo ſtedfaſt in regarding this faire ſleeper, that it might have ſeem'd he had
communicated his heavineſſe to her, but that her eyes were ſtill open: but
ſhe thought ſhe had not eye-ſight enough to conſider him well, ſo many beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ſaw ſhe, the leaſt of which was capable to have the poſſeſſion of her eyes,
and fill them with admiration. She put one knee to the ground, as it were to
render him homage, and came ſoftly neere to kiſſe him, that he might not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake;
but <hi>Eurylas</hi> at the ſame time heav'd himſelfe up, and fetch'd a deepe
ſigh from his ſtomacke; which conſtrain'd her to retire, thinking he had bin
about to wake, and gave her a ſight of <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> that were ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
alſo there hard by, whom ſhe had not before beene aware of, for being
ſo much taken up with the ſight of <hi>Eurylas.</hi> That caus'd her to be a little fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
ſeeing her ſelfe all alone betweene three men: and yet conſidering them
ſhe took them for perſons of honeſt quality; and to ſee their equipage, judg'd
they had ſuffer'd ſome injury. Shee advis'd to goe home, and returne againe
with ſome of her people, that with her might deſire them to take covert at
her houſe; and as ſhe was going away, ſhe could not chooſe but caſt her eye
upon <hi>Eurylas</hi> beauty: yet at length ſhe left him; and being in the houſe, ſhee
perſwaded her husband to goe walke out with her into the wood, that hee
might himſelfe invite them home to him. A little while after ſhe went away,
<hi>Epicharis</hi> awaked, and letting <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> ſleepe on, would have
<pb facs="tcp:7768:54"/>
riſen, and perceiv'd foure or five comming to them; ſhe tooke them to bee
ſome of thoſe that dwelt at the next houſe, and were now walking towards
the evening at their liberty. They waked <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> out of their
ſleepe at their firſt comming neere, and enquir'd of her what they did there;
to which ſhe anſwer'd, that they were three brothers who had loſt in the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>Rome</hi> the beſt of their goods, and were robbed of that which
was left them, and now were brought to lye thus upon the ground, in getting
by little and little to <hi>Sicily</hi> where they ſhould not want for conveniences. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinna</hi>
ſeem'd to be toucht with pitty for them, and prayed <hi>Curio</hi> her husband
to take them home with him for a night. This man that was of a ſufficient
good nature, was well content therewith, and could not take them for theeves
becauſe of their faſhion, and eſpecially to ſee they had no ſwords; ſo hee
told them, that if they would come to his houſe they ſhould be very welcome.
<hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> agreed, ſeeing this free invitation, and thanked him
as courteouſly as they could. They went along with them thus for company.
<hi>Melintus</hi> telling <hi>Curio</hi> the newes of <hi>Rome</hi> in his ordinary pleaſing way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
and when they were come to the houſe, they all ſupp'd together. But
it was impoſſible for <hi>Corinna</hi> to diſſemble the affection ſhee had to <hi>Eurylas</hi>
when her husbands eye were off; and <hi>Palamede,</hi> that began to have a good
minde to <hi>Corinna,</hi> ſeeing ſhe was very gentile, and of an humour free enough,
did the more obſerve the looks ſhe ſent to <hi>Eurylas,</hi> which made him wiſh this
affection were rather addreſt to him, that he might make ſome uſe of the good
fortune. That which perfected her dying for him, was, that <hi>Eurylas</hi> finding a
Lute, tooke it, and fitting his ſweet voyce to it, ſung theſe verſes:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>WHile amiable youthfulneſſe</l>
                  <l>Inflames within us faire deſires</l>

                  <l>Our fortune to us may addreſſe;</l>
                  <l>And ſuffer not a day remove,</l>
                  <l>Without ſome ſweet delights of love.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The ſeaſon of our borrowed light</l>
                  <l>Ought not to paſſe away in vaine,</l>
                  <l>Wherein we doe ſo freely gaine</l>
                  <l>The power as well as appetite,</l>
                  <l>To ſuffer not one day remove,</l>
                  <l>Without ſome ſweet delights of love.</l>

                  <l>Malicious, or malecontent</l>
                  <l>With their deſpight or jealouſies;</l>
                  <l>But let not us one day remove,</l>
                  <l>Without ſome ſweet delights of love.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>There little wanted, that <hi>Corinna</hi> tranſported with love, had not gone to
kiſſe the delicate mouth that ſang with ſo many charmes, but the preſence of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7768:55"/>
her husband and the company ſerved for a bridle to her. 'Twas no difficult
matter for her to be perſwaded by <hi>Eurylas</hi> ſong, into this humour, and to
take the occaſion her love offered her, and ſhe thought he gave her advice of
what ſhe had to doe; and <hi>Palamede</hi> was of this mind too, who never look'd
off <hi>Corinna,</hi> whileſt <hi>Melintus</hi> entertain'd the good man <hi>Curio,</hi> that began to
have a very great eſteeme of his gueſts. When it was bed time, <hi>Curio</hi> and
<hi>Corinna</hi> brought them to a chamber neere unto thoſe where they us'd to lye
apart one from the other, wherein there were two beds. <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
choſe the biggeſt, for they ſaid, they would never be ſeparated, and left
the leaſt for <hi>Eurylas. Corinna</hi> was very glad for that reſolution, and when ſhe
left them, gave the good night to <hi>Eurylas,</hi> ſo as he well perceiv'd the affection
mingled withall. <hi>Palamede</hi> conſider'd all her actions, and having learn'd that
ſhe lay in one chamber, and her husband in another, hee thought, that if in
the night he could make her beleeve he was <hi>Eurylas,</hi> hee might eaſily enjoy
her: ſo as he was reſolv'd to riſe from <hi>Melintus,</hi> and goe ſecretly into <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinna's</hi>
chamber, imagining that without doubt the love ſhe had for <hi>Eurylas,</hi>
would hinder her from ſleeping, and he might eaſily be received of her. On
the other ſide, <hi>Corinna</hi> being retir'd with her husband, had the ſame deſigne
to riſe out of her bed, and come to lye with <hi>Eurylas,</hi> not beleeving him to
be of a diſpoſition to refuſe a faire Lady: And <hi>Curio</hi> willing they ſhould ſhut
up theſe ſtrangers cloſe into their chambers for feare of ſome accident, ſhee
was not of that opinion, for that were, ſaid ſhe, openly to miſtruſt them, that
it ſuffic'd to ſhut the doores of the houſe ſure, and they would not dare to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any thing. That being appointed, <hi>Curio</hi> by misfortune would needs
lye with his wife that night, to whom this purpoſe was very unwelcome: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
when he was aſleepe, ſhe roſe and purſued what ſhee had to doe.
<hi>Corinna</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> at the very ſame time went out of their chambers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any noyſe-making, and meeting one another in the darke at a paſſage,
knock'd their heads ſo rudely together, that they were even falling backwards
withall: and yet having each of them but ſcandalous intentions, and not
willing to be diſcover'd, they kept themſelves from crying out, or expreſſing
any paine for the blow: They would neither of them enter into their owne
chambers for feare they ſhould be knowne. <hi>Palamede</hi> ignorant of what hee
was beſt to doe, ſtood ſtill in the ſame place, and lean'd himſelfe againſt the
wall; but <hi>Corinna</hi> better acquainted with the turnings, ſlid her ſoftly downe
the ſteps. <hi>Palamede</hi> taking heart, and thinking it was ſome groome, gave not
over going into <hi>Corinna's</hi> chamber; and ſhe hearing no more of him ſhe had
encountred, went up the ſtaires againe and entred into the chamber of <hi>Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las.</hi>
She came neere his bed, then ſitting her downe upon't making no noiſe,
ſhe embrac'd <hi>Eurylas</hi> and kiſs'd him, to make him awake gently. <hi>Epicharis</hi>
feeling as ſhe began to wake, ſome body that preſs'd her on that faſhion, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, and would have got her ſelfe looſe; but <hi>Corinna</hi> laboured to make
her hold her peace, and told her ſhe was <hi>Corinna,</hi> that moved with a love to
him, was come to give up her ſelfe to his bed, and offer him all the favours he
could deſire of her. <hi>Melintus</hi> wak'd with that noyſe, and not feeling <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
neere him, thought he was practiſing upon <hi>Epicharis,</hi> and went towards
the bed to hinder him. <hi>Corinna</hi> hearing him come, eſcap'd and ran into her
owne chamber, where ſhe ſtumbled upon two perſons that lay upon the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7768:55"/>
ground, and fell with her head ſo cruelly againſt the bed, as ſhe was not able
to riſe againe. Shee cryed out and call'd for a light, and in the meane while
heard a man that ſaid, why brother, are you mad? I am <hi>Palamede</hi> you tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thus. At laſt a light was brought; <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Eurylas</hi> came running
alſo thither, and found three downe all along upon the place; <hi>Corinna</hi> hurt,
and <hi>Curio</hi> with <hi>Palamede,</hi> that held one another faſt, and were wraſtling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But when <hi>Curio</hi> knew it was <hi>Palamede,</hi> he was in a great wonder, and
ask'd him, wherefore he was come to his bed? <hi>Palamede</hi> for his part ſeem'd
as much amaz'd to ſee himſelfe in that chamber, and ſaid to <hi>Curio</hi> he thought
he had come to his owne, and gone againe to bed to his brother; and how
he had cauſe to thinke ſtrange <hi>Melintus</hi> ſhould take ſuch hold of him if hee
were not mad. <hi>Curio</hi> ask'd him pardon, and told him he tooke him for ſome
robber that would have kill'd him, feeling a man, as he wak'd, that held his
armes. <hi>Epicharis</hi> and <hi>Melintus</hi> had paine enough to keepe from laughing, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in that diſorder. <hi>Corinna</hi> putting her hand to her broken face, and
leaning it againſt her forehead, ſaid, that having heard a noyſe upon the
ſtaires, ſhe would know what the matter was, and at her returne found them
in that poſture to give her the fall. The ſuſpition <hi>Curio</hi> might have of his
wife, was changed into pitty to ſee her in that caſe; and after they had all of
them got up, and ſome remedy was applyed to two or three hurts ſhe had on
her face, and to thoſe of <hi>Curio</hi> and <hi>Palamede,</hi> for they had fallen from the bed
one upon another, <hi>Palamede</hi> deſir'd their pardon, his error having caus'd all
that diſaſter, and every one retir'd to his chamber, where <hi>Melintus, Palamede,</hi>
and <hi>Epicharis</hi> ſhut themſelves up for feare the noyſe of their laughter ſhould
be heard, which they refraind as much as was poſſible. <hi>Palamede</hi> knew then
it was <hi>Corinna</hi> he had encountred in the paſſage, going to have ſurpriſed <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rylas,</hi>
and how ſhe was forc'd to get her gone at <hi>Melintus</hi> comming. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
to them alſo, that willing to goe find <hi>Corinna,</hi> and put himſelfe upon her
bed, he had in ſtead of her embrac'd that man that had awak'd, and ſeiz'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his body at the inſtant, that he was ſtrangely amaz'd to feele a beard, and a
man that would not let him eſcape, did he what he could; that in ſtriving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
they were fallen from the bed, and <hi>Curio</hi> undermoſt, whoſe fall muſt
needs have well dazled him, for that he did not ſo much as dreame of calling
for helpe: that in the end he thought he was to make as if he had beene miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
and to call him brother, to have him beleeve he tooke him for <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and was in a wonder he ſhould be in ſo great a madneſſe, as not to let him
goe, what ever he did to get out of his hands. They never ceas'd laughing
the reſt of the night at theſe rancounters. Nevertheleſſe <hi>Melintus</hi> reproached
<hi>Palamede</hi> for having had a thought to ſuch an enterprize. He excus'd him by
the example of <hi>Corinna,</hi> whoſe attempt was no leſſe unchaſte, and intreated
<hi>Epicharis</hi> to pardon him that crime, which ſhe willingly did, not being able,
ſhe ſaid, to take offence at a thing that had made them ſo much mirth.</p>
               <p>About morning they fell aſleepe, and waked not till it was neere noone:
and being up, it was told them <hi>Corinna</hi> kept her bed. They went to ſee her,
and to know how ſhe did; and meeting with <hi>Curio</hi> in the chamber, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
againe to him the diſpleaſure they had for being cauſe of her ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
then they came towards the bed, where they found her with her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
bound up, but yet very curiouſly, and as if in that diſorder of her face
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7768:56"/>
ſhe had not beene over negligent in dreſſing her. <hi>Palamede</hi> made her a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
excuſes for his ill fortune: and a little after going aſide with <hi>Melintus</hi>
to entertaine <hi>Curio, Corinna</hi> tooke <hi>Eurylas</hi> by the hand, ſaying to him, What
will you doe for one that has beene thus handled for love of you? Madam,
ſayes he, all that ever I can doe in the world I offer you, in aſſurance that I am
too much ingag'd to you, and dying for griefe that I was not able to receive
the favours you would have permitted me. <hi>Palamede</hi> would favour the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
and pleaſing deceit of <hi>Corinna;</hi> for he drew <hi>Curio</hi> on the other
ſide of the bed, as he ſpake to him: and <hi>Corinna</hi> taking the occaſion, ſaid
to <hi>Eurylas,</hi> I ſee very well you muſt forſake me now, but promiſe me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
hither one day, and you ſhall ſee what affection I have to you. As ſhee
ſpake thoſe words, ſhe brought <hi>Eurylas</hi> head cloſe to hers, and kiſt him with
a great tranſportation: and beſides, ſhe uncover'd all her neck to him, that he
might be the more in love with her. <hi>Eurylas</hi> had trouble enough to refraine
laughing, and to recompence her with the like favours could wel have ſhewn
her as much: but he was content to give her kiſſes back, and promis'd her
it ſhould not be long ere he came to ſee her againe. They were at laſt to give
over that delightful exerciſe, for fear of being taken by the husband that came
for <hi>Eurylas</hi> to lead him to dinner. The ſweetneſſe of <hi>Melintus</hi> converſation
had wholly gained that man: and at dinner he told him, that ſome Jewels
they had ſtill hidden about them; but it would bee hard to change them for
things that were more neceſſary, as horſes and other proviſions. <hi>Curio</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to accommodate them: and preſently they went to his ſtable, where
they made choyce of three horſes, for which <hi>Epicharis</hi> gave him a Ring that
was of a farre greater value, becauſe ſhe would recompence him for the good
entertainment they receiv'd at his houſe. <hi>Curio</hi> gave them beſides to every
one a ſword, and ſomething with them to eat the reſt of the day: then they
went to take leave of <hi>Corinna,</hi> who wept to ſee <hi>Eurylas</hi> part; yet ſhee
conceal'd her teares; and <hi>Curio</hi> having ſeene them a horſebacke, let them
goe with a great deale of ſorrow.</p>
               <p>They were no ſooner a good way off out of their ſight, but having liberty
to laugh, they were diſpos'd to mocke at the abuſe of <hi>Corinna,</hi> and her ſo
paſſionate farewell. The incounters of <hi>Palamede</hi> alſo ſerv'd them for no ſmall
paſtime; and <hi>Epicharis</hi> flouting him, that his deſires had beene ſo rewarded:
I finde, ſayes he, there is nothing ſo delightfull as that which falls out in love:
for if a man has that he deſires, nothing is more happy; and the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
that may arrive, is but matter of laughter. I, ſayes <hi>Epicharis</hi> but the
miſchiefe is, you are laugh'd at to your coſt: I finde you onely happy in
this, that you are of a humour that ſhrinks not for any accident befals you.
It is true, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> for I beleeve never any man was ſo often deceiv'd
and puniſh'd as he. At <hi>Athens</hi> he began his apprentiſhip, with a thouſand tricks
were played upon him: at <hi>Rome</hi> he hardly ſcap'd dying in the trade: and
here, ſee what an adventure 'twas to goe caſt himſelfe into the armes of an
husband, and ſo to be quit for the hurt he receiv'd in his face. Beſides all this,
replide <hi>Epicharis,</hi> his greateſt unhappineſſe is, that experience cannot make
him wiſe. How well you are both agreed, ſaid <hi>Palamede,</hi> to deſpiſe my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour!
but tell me, whoſe courage doe you eſteeme the greater, of him that
puts himſelfe into many hazards, comes well off with ſome, is hurt in others,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7768:56"/>
but never yeelds: or his, that never attempts any thing? Would you have
one, after he has beene wounded in a combat, quit armes for ever and grow
wiſe by experience? You have reaſon, anſwer'd <hi>Melintus,</hi> to make a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
with love and valour: but as valour is a vertue, ſo you ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
with it a vertuous love, that is not faſtened but to a faire and perfect
object, like as valour that has nothing for its object but honour, no differing
conſiderations to move to the duties of it: ſo in love, he that ſhall have but
one deſigne, and ever maintaines that, is more couragious than he that will
alwayes be changing the ſubject of it. <hi>Palamede</hi> replide, if you will needs
compare Love to Valour, in my conceit this is exercis'd upon differing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and divers encounters; one while in the ſiege of a Towne, another
at a battell, another againe in a private combat. Yet ever 'tis but one va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
ſayes <hi>Melintus,</hi> cutting him ſhort: Neither is it but one love, anſwer'd
<hi>Palamede,</hi> that makes me cheriſh every thing that is amiable. But this valour,
ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> hath but one object, which is honour. And this love, replide
<hi>Palamede,</hi> hath but one object neither, which is pleaſure. Pleaſure, ſaid <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
cannot be the object of a vertuous love; and if you will heare me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
you will be of my minde. Vertue never has any thing for object, but
that which is perfect and certaine, and for this reaſon ſhe her ſelfe is her owne
end and recompence, there being nothing in the world perfect and certaine
but ſhee. So hath valour no ſatisfaction but in it ſelfe, and this is that wee
call honour, which is nothing elſe but the glory that is in us for not failing
in what valour requires at our hands, what diſgrace ſoever may happen; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
fortune hath no power over vertues: hee that has this quality in perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
is as valiant being overcome, as when he is victorious, and is conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to himſelfe of the ſame glory: Victory and honours cannot be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
objects of it, becauſe theſe are not things we can be aſſur'd of. In like
manner, the perfect love cannot have pleaſure for his principall end, becauſe
it is not certaine, but depends on the will of another: and for that cauſe his
end cannot be to be lov'd neither, theſe being things that are without us, and
we cannot diſpoſe of: but his onely certaine object is this, to love perfectly:
So the end of this perfect love is in it ſelfe, and can never faile it. If it chances
one be loved, or receives ſome contentment, theſe are but fruits of love, and
not the end, even as victory and honours are to valour: otherwiſe it muſt be
neceſſary, that after the ſatisfactions love receiv'd, and the honours that valour
poſſeſs'd, both this and that ſhould ceaſe, and have no more operation, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
arriv'd at their end. You ſee that imperfect loves, that have no other end
but pleaſure, dye as ſoone as ever they have attain'd that pleaſure; and this
might ſerve for an infallible reaſon to make you beleeve there muſt be an end
farre more noble, and more aſſured than pleaſure, to crowne a perfect and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
decaying love.</p>
               <p>I beleeve, ſaid <hi>Epicharis</hi> to <hi>Palamede,</hi> you would be much troubled to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
theſe reaſons. 'Tis very eaſie for him, ſayes he, to vanquiſh an enemy
that feeles his conſcience wounded, being to maintaine an evill cauſe: for
all the diſaſters I have met with, and reaſon with this very diſpute learne mee
thus much, that we are to love but one thing which is perfectly lovely, and
for this cauſe that it is you alone I am to love: I pray you, ſaid <hi>Epicharis,</hi> make
not <hi>Melintus</hi> weapons ſerve your turne againſt mee: and yet I ſhall not bee
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7768:57"/>
diſpleas'd that he inſtruct you; and when you have had time enough to bee
made wiſe, I ſhall demand of him what I ought to thinke of you. Sweare,
ſaid <hi>Palamede,</hi> you will alwayes report your ſelfe to him. That will I ſurely,
ſaid ſhe, ſo much confidence have I in him, that hee ſhall herein be Judge
with <hi>Ariana. Melintus</hi> ſaid, there was hope of amendment in <hi>Palamede,</hi> and
that he would promiſe, if <hi>Epicharis</hi> joyn'd her helpe, to make of him a perfect
lover one day for her ſake, having already a Maſter very affectionate, and a
Miſtreſſe very lovely. Aſſure your ſelves, replied <hi>Palamede,</hi> that I knew before
how to love very well, what ever I ſaid, for I love none but the faire <hi>Epicharis;</hi>
'tis ſhe I love perfectly, and will love her ſo for ever. Do you take theſe little
ſearches I make to others for infidelities? What be they elſe, ſayes <hi>Melintus?</hi> I
would faine know, went <hi>Palamede</hi> on, if to love ſo perfectly as you pretend,
you abſtaine from all ſorts of pleaſures, as hunting, paſtimes, exerciſes, and
what ever elſe may content you? That were not reaſonable, anſwer'd <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
So then, ſaid <hi>Palamede,</hi> theſe little favours are of thoſe pleaſures we are
not to avoyd. The choyce a man has made once in his heart, continues ſtill
there; and by this meanes he attends with patience, till the cruelties of her
he ſeekes be over, and the time may bring ſome eaſe to his deſires. I finde
this, ſaid <hi>Epicharis,</hi> an eaſie way of loving; and if all were of your diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there would not be heard ſuch complaints and deſperations of lovers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they would ſo ſoone know wherewith to comfort them. 'Tis not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Palamede,</hi> a particular humour in mee, but reaſon that makes mee love
after that faſhion, and every one finds contentment by it; for having a cruell
Miſtreſſe, I ſeeke for conſolation to the uſage ſhe makes me, and in the meane
time leave her in repoſe. When all comes to all, replide <hi>Melintus,</hi> you would
perſwade us, that you love extremely, but deſire moderately; and if you can
make theſe two agree, you have reaſon for what you ſay. Although, ſayes
<hi>Palamede,</hi> I follow not theſe deſires ſo ardently, thinke you I deſire the leſſe
for that? Contrariwiſe, I more honour her I love, not to torment her, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her reſolv'd to grant me nothing; and appeaſe where I may the violence
of my deſires. But, replide <hi>Melintus,</hi> they are not the deſires you have for
her, which you goe to eaſe otherwhere; they be ſome other. Sometimes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<hi>Palamede,</hi> I imagine I am eaſing thoſe very deſires, perſwading my ſelfe
I enjoy her, and receive thoſe favours at her hands. Ah ye gods! cried out
<hi>Melintus,</hi> what crimes are here together. And why, ſaid <hi>Palamede,</hi> am I ſo
criminall? Firſt of all, replide <hi>Melintus,</hi> in ſeeking theſe favours from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
you ſerve your ſelfe of the ſame words, and the ſame oaths which you
uſe to her you love: ſee there prophan'd the faireſt meanes you can have to
make your ſelfe be loved, imploying them indifferently upon a thouſand
ſubjects unworthy of the vertuous deſigne you ought to have: What poore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
it is to lye? and which of them all can beleeve you, having but the ſame
proteſtations to give in all places? after all this, if you love but one perſon,
can you ſtill finde another lovely, and there ſtay your eyes? for, as for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime
which you alleage, a man may ſeeke that, without injuring his love:
but one beauty may ſtand in competition with another, and if you can make
much of any, with, or beſides that you love, 'tis infidelity. But what crime
can be greater than that your imagination commits in the favours of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
and will your fancy then needs have it her you are courting, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7768:57"/>
your diſcourſe with affectation, who either yeelds with weakneſſe, or
proſtitutes her ſelfe with ſhameleſneſſe? and doe you perfectly love her you
imagine to your ſelfe, with all thoſe defects? You charge me very criminal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſaid <hi>Palamede,</hi> but I proteſt to you I have not ſo vile an intention. No, no,
purſues <hi>Melintus,</hi> you muſt reſolve with your ſelfe, either to beleeve your
affection is very imperfect, or elſe to purge it of all thoſe errors, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to make it perfect. See there, ſaid <hi>Epicharis,</hi> one good leſſon already; and
if every day he tooke but ſuch another, I thinke he might be reduced into
the right way. To heare you both ſpeake, replied <hi>Palamede,</hi> it ſeemes I
have beene inſtructed in an ill Love-ſchoole, and muſt endevour to forget
the falſe principles I there learn'd: but I doe ſtill finde ſomething in me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the auſterity of your precepts: Nevertheleſſe I honour my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and love my Miſtreſſe ſo well, that I ſhall receive their rules upon their
word, without examination; and ſubmitting to your reaſons, I will make
you have obligation to me too for the paines I free my ſelfe of, in the ſearch
of contrary reaſons. They were then come to a paſſe of a river ſomething
difficult, which hindred <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Eurylas</hi> reply to him, to minde where
the eaſieſt place of going over might be. <hi>Palamede</hi> having firſt ſounded the
depth of the water, and being on the other ſide, betooke him to ſinging.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>It will be a very difficult matter for us, ſayes <hi>Epicharis</hi> to <hi>Melintus,</hi> to gaine
any thing upon him by inſtructions: for ſee if he be not already return'd to
his firſt errour. You give a wrong judgement, anſwers <hi>Palamede,</hi> of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions;
becauſe I meane to make theſe falſe opinions come out at my
mouth, as it were ſome poyſon or ill nouriſhment I had taken, and I have no
other meanes to rid me of them. The ſame cenſure you are to give of all I
ſhall hereafter ſay contrary to fidelity, in anſwering your arguments: for I
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7768:58"/>
ſhall receive yours in hearkning to them, and let goe my owne, as I mention
them to you. Here's a pretty device indeed, ſayes <hi>Epicharis,</hi> to contradict
us all his life long, under the pretext of letting out his falſe reaſons. I am afraid
truly, replide <hi>Melintus,</hi> ours get not out of his minde as eaſily. Give mee
them, ſaid <hi>Palamede,</hi> good ones and ſtrong enough, to the end they may take
ſo ſure root there, as nothing ſhall be able to ſhake them for going out. Take
beed, replied <hi>Melintus,</hi> the fault be not in the reaſons, but in the place that
peradventure is ſo ſlippery, that nothing can remaine firme in it. They ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the tediouſneſſe of the way with theſe diſcourſes that held them untill
the evening; and chancing upon a place commodious enough to eat what
they brought with them, they ſtayed their journey, and let their horſes feed
upon the graſſe; but after ſupper they reſolv'd to goe all night, for avan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
their voyage.</p>
               <p>Being a horſebacke againe, they entred into a Foreſt a little before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
and had not gone through the halfe of it when night began to approach.
<hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Epicharis</hi> were together, and went before: <hi>Melintus</hi> was about
twenty paces of them, and entertain'd his imaginations, when there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to him an apparition upon a great blacke horſe, his face of a fearefull
blackneſſe, his body all cover'd with long and briſtly haire, and holding a club
on his ſhoulder.</p>
               <p>A man leſſe aſſured than <hi>Melintus,</hi> would have beene terrified at ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a viſion; but he in no amazement ſtood ſtill, and ask'd him boldly if he
had any thing to ſay to him. Know, anſwers the ſpirit, that thy death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.
Thou tell'ſt me no newes, replide <hi>Melintus,</hi> I know it approaches
every day. That monſter without a returne would have diſcharg'd upon his
head a blow with the mace; but he avoyded it by bending his body, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
tooke his ſword in his hand. Then hee ſaw comming to him another
monſter a horſebacke, like to the former; and without trouble to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
amongſt theſe Devils, he began to charge him that had ſpoken to him,
and at the ſame time thought how the other might doe him no wrong. <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
and <hi>Epicharis</hi> that ſaw <hi>Melintus</hi> did not follow them, return'd backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and wondred ſtrangely to finde him engaged in a combat againſt ſuch
fearfull ſpirits. <hi>Epicharis</hi> was ſeized with horror, but <hi>Palamede</hi> that would not
have feared to aſſaile all the powers of hell to ſuccour his friend, tooke his
ſword in his hand, and ſet upon him that came laſt. At that time <hi>Melintus</hi>
had runne his ſword into the other he firſt tooke him to, in many places, eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
with nimbleneſſe the blowes of his club, and in the end made him fall
from his horſe. <hi>Palamede</hi> delivered himſelfe too in a ſmall time from him he
had taken in hand; and theſe two friends were very glad to ſee thoſe ſpirits
had a life to loſe, ſince they poured out ſo much bloud, being fallen to the
ground, and had no more motion left in them. They alighted from their
horſes, and conſidering them, found they were two men that had black'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their faces and their hands, and dreſt them in skinnes, it may be to skare
paſſengers, and kill them with the more eaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epicharis</hi> had gone afarre off for feare, and they had much adoe to re-aſſure
her, and make her come neere to ſee thoſe dead bodies. At laſt ſhe came on,
and wondred extremely that <hi>Melintus</hi> was not terrified at the firſt appearing
of theſe phantaſmes. The Moone gave them light enough for not wandring
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7768:58"/>
out of their way, and to beware they were not againe aſſaulted by the like
monſters; but yet they came out of the wood without danger when the
night was even ſpent: and at breake of day they met with a man on foot, who
ſeeing them comming, demanded if they had not encountred the two ſpirits
that had ſlaine ſo many men within ſeven or eight dayes. Yes, anſwered <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi>
but they did us no harme at all. I wonder, replide that man, they
ſhould ſpare you. Indeed, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> they ſomewhat affrighted us; but
from whence come they, doe men thinke? They ſay, replies he, they are
infernall gods, that were conſtrain'd to quit the Temple of <hi>Proſerpine</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>
when it was burn'd, and how they will never give over killing, till they have
built them another. For my part I am not ſo deſperate as you, for I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
round about the Foreſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> for feare of falling into their hands.
Friend, ſaid <hi>Melintus</hi> to him ſmiling, thoſe gods were not immortall then:
feare not paſſing by the Foreſt, you ſhall finde their bodies lying on the
ground, which we have depriv'd of life, and aſſure your ſelfe they were but
theeves diſguis'd into ſpirits, to kill and rob paſſengers with more facility af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had affrighted them. This man would not beleeve him for all that:
they ſwore to him all three, it was true; and that if hee were weary of going
a foot, he might chance to finde one of thoſe wretches horſes, and get up to
ride: but hee could not be perſwaded what ever aſſurances they gave him;
and would not take the way of the Foreſt, ſo hard a matter is it to caſt
out feare and the beleefe of fabulous ſtories out of vulgar ſpirits.</p>
               <p>They went on their way, and after they had ſufficiently ſpoken of this
rancounter, they tooke up their laſt dayes diſcourſe for to inſtruct <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
in the lawes of fidelity. <hi>Epicharis</hi> ask'd him if he would have <hi>Melintus</hi>
give him another love-leſſon. I had rather, ſayes hee, take it from you: for
from the very firſt I ſhould prove a Maſter. There needs him no other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> but to examine well his life paſt, and hee will finde that
ill deſires have brought him nought but ſhame and misfortune, and that he
never taſted pleaſure but in vertuous affections: for I will have him confeſſe
to me, if the honeſt behaviour of the wiſe <hi>Eriphile</hi> and her ſweet entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the very refuſe, were not more pleaſing to him than the favours he
thought he had enjoy'd of her in the deceit was put upon him. But, ſaid <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charis,</hi>
may not I know that ſtory? I ſhall bleſſe, replide <hi>Palamede,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
all my life, for giving originall to the friendſhip of <hi>Melintus</hi> and me. Now
you give me, ſaid <hi>Epicharis,</hi> a greater deſire to know it, for 'tis a thing I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet heard of; and if <hi>Melintus</hi> would take the paines to make this relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to me, I would thinke the ſervice I have done you well rewarded. <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede,</hi>
replide <hi>Melintus,</hi> might better tell you all the particulars of it; but ſince
I can acquit my ſelfe ſo good cheape, for that I am indebted to you, I will
not loſe the occaſion. <hi>Epicharis</hi> told him, If that be too ſmall a requeſt, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
with it your owne ſtory beſides, and tell me all that happened to you at
<hi>Athens,</hi> and in your voyage into <hi>Aſia.</hi> It is but reaſon, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> you
ſhould know how the lives have paſs'd, which you have beene the preſerver
of. This relation, added <hi>Palamede,</hi> will be very delightfull to you, if with it
he reports all the glory and the advantages he acquired: for I feare that for
this cauſe he will conceale from you the faireſt adventures of all. You would
willingly, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> have me leave to you this occaſion of diſcourſe to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7768:59"/>
                  <hi>Epicharis,</hi> but you ſhall finde other ſervices to render her. I would be
very loth, replide <hi>Palamede,</hi> to hinder her from hearing you: but take it not
ill, if you forget any thing, that I remember you of it. <hi>Melintus</hi> was content,
after hee had rejected the praiſes they gave him; and ſome time after he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
thus:</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Hiſtory of Melintus, Eriphile, and Palamede.</head>
                  <p>THere are very fortunate paſſages to be met with in the life of men, which
if they would make right uſe of, they might eaſily addict themſelves to
vertue and glory: and I finde that fortune is of maine conſequence to good
deſignes, providing the meanes both to undertake, and to execute enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes.
I tell you this, not to have you thinke I had by this meanes acquired
any quality: but to confeſſe unto you, that I am the leſſe excuſable, if I
have not made uſe of this good fortune and facility that have alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
me.</p>
                  <p>When I was ſent by <hi>Telephus</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> hee directed mee to the houſe of
one of his friends called <hi>Ephialtes,</hi> whoſe wife <hi>Eriphile</hi> was very handſome,
and one of the wiſeſt women I ever knew. And her husband had ſuch truſt
in her vertue, that he was not afraid to receive me into his houſe, although
I were very young, and handſome enough at that age; nay, he never had ſo
much as a jealouſie for the cares ſhe ſince tooke of me: for I confeſſe ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me as her owne ſonne, although ſhe was not above two or three yeeres
elder than I; and ſeeing that I had conceiv'd an affection to her great enough,
ſhe would make uſe of this good will of mine to get a power over mee, to
have me learne with paſſion all my Arts and exerciſes. In ſuch ſort, that fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me to be of a very willing diſpoſition, ſhe ſometimes commended mee
to encourage me, ſometimes ſhe kiſt me on the forehead for a recompence,
but yet farre from her husbands eye; and I ſweare to you, that greatly ſerv'd
to advance my ſtudies; becauſe I employ'd my time in them for love of her,
quite after another faſhion than I had done for my owne ſake. Beſides, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her vertue, I was in awe of her, and durſt not attempt any thing that I
was not ſure would be pleaſing to her. I gave her account of all I learn'd,
which made me carefull in ſpending my time well; and preſently ſhe became
as learned as my ſelfe: On the other ſide ſhe taught me honeſt manners, and
the good faſhion of living thoſe of our condition are to follow; ſo as one
taught the other what he knew, and learn'd of the other what hee was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of; and thus was it a very delightfull ſchoole. After imparting my ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to her, I let her ſee the improvement I made at our exerciſes. I did my
armes in her preſence, I wraſtled, I lanc'd the Javelin; and <hi>Ephialtes,</hi> that
was one of the prime men of the City, having alwayes faire horſes beſides
thoſe were mine, I exercis'd them before her; and when ſhee approv'd my
riding, I thought my paines well rewarded. At the beginning I lov'd her as
ſhee had beene my mother, but comming to more age and underſtanding,
which gave me the more credit with her, and diſpens'd ſo great ſubmiſſions
to me, I loved her as my ſiſter: ſo as entring into her confidence, ſhee had
now no ſecret to hide from me. <hi>Palamede</hi> was then at <hi>Athens</hi> too, and ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
more time at his exerciſes than at his ſtudies, hee came off with much
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7768:59"/>
dexterity and grace in them. We did every thing in emulation one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without any other acquaintance, but that wee were both of the ſame
City. <hi>Palamede</hi> ſhall confeſſe with me that one of us ſuffer'd with ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
the commendations were given to the other, and this ſpurre ſerv'd
alſo to make us more diligent in well-doing, ſo as there was not any there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that might exceed us.</p>
                  <p>But leave we this diſcourſe of our exerciſes, to ſpeake of his amorous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
After having loved ſome Ladies of <hi>Athens,</hi> where there is no want of
thoſe that are flexible enough, and being weary of favours ſo eaſily obtain'd,
as thoſe he had enjoyed to his coſt; one day he ſaw <hi>Eriphile,</hi> and fell in love
with her; without delay he gave teſtimonies of his affection to her, by the
care he had to ſee her in all places where ſhe was to come: but he well knew
he ſhould have trouble to obtaine what he deſir'd of her; for her modeſty
was very great, and by her ſpeeches ſhee never gave him any hold, whereby
he might take the boldneſſe to propound any thing that might offend her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Nevertheleſſe having learn'd that ſhe frequented ſometimes at a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
of meane condition, who was called <hi>Harpalice,</hi> married to a freed man
of <hi>Ephialtes,</hi> and that this woman was very crafty and covetous, he hop'd to
gaine her by her covetouſneſſe, and that ſhe might gaine <hi>Eriphile</hi> by her craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe.
He made his addreſſe therefore to her, and this woman receiv'd him,
and aſſur'd him there was none but ſhee that had power over <hi>Eriphile,</hi> or was
capable to ſerve him. She entertain'd him a while only with hope; then one
day ſhe told him that <hi>Eriphile</hi> having loſt a very rich chaine of gold, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her husband ſhould know it, he had a faire occaſion offer'd him to get
her good graces, by preſenting her with ſuch another. <hi>Palamede</hi> inſtantly
promis'd it, and <hi>Harpalice</hi> having deſcrib'd to him the faſhion of that chaine,
he beſpake it at a Goldſmiths. But when he had it, he fear'd <hi>Harpalice</hi> might
not give it to <hi>Eriphile:</hi> ſo as he intreated her that he might be the bearer of
it himſelfe, to the end this might give him occaſion to ſee her in private, and
that ſhe would finde ſome meanes for this meeting. <hi>Harpalice</hi> was a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
yet ſhe told him ſhe would know that of her, and two dayes after aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
him, how <hi>Eriphile</hi> had promis'd to come to her houſe; that ſhee would
faine to make an aſſembly of Ladies, whereat ſome men might be preſent
too, then ſhe would put them into a chamber apart, where he might give the
preſent into her owne hand, and that there he might endevour to vanquiſh
her by intreaties. <hi>Palamede</hi> waited for that day with a great deale of joy, and
<hi>Harpalice</hi> was not wanting to make her aſſembly: but before the company
was come, ſhe carried <hi>Palamede</hi> into a chamber next to that where the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
was to be. Thither came I alſo waiting upon <hi>Eriphile,</hi> and <hi>Harpalice</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the chamber where <hi>Palamede</hi> was, ſet him to obſerve thorow the
crannies thoſe that were in the other chamber, and amongſt others, <hi>Eriphile</hi>
and me. Doe you not ſee, ſaid ſhee, how <hi>Eriphile</hi> bluſhes, and is full of
thoughtfulneſſe for the purpoſe ſhe has to come to finde you? <hi>Palamede</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
with himſelfe it was ſo; and when ſhe left him, ſhe ſaid, You may ſee
when I take her by the hand to bring her to you, but ſhe will have me take
away the light, for feare you be ſeene together in this chamber through the
ſame crannies. <hi>Palamede</hi> conſented, ſeeing it muſt be ſo; and a little while
after ſhe came to take <hi>Eriphile</hi> by the hand, becauſe ſhe ſaid, ſhe would carry
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7768:60"/>
her to ſee what was in the other Chamber. Shee had brought her to ſet her
foot into the Chamber where <hi>Palamede</hi> was, but it was ſo darke, that <hi>Eriphile</hi>
retiring her ſaid ſomething loud, Whither doe you lead me, <hi>Harpalice?</hi> This
crafty woman came backe againe preſently after, bringing with her in the
darke another woman well inſtructed what ſhe had to doe, and ſaid to <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
in giving him her, I had much adoe to make her reſolve, ſerve your
ſelfe of the occaſion; but I pray ſpeake low: for I ſhould be diſhonoured
if you chanced to be heard; then ſhe ſhut them up both together. <hi>Palamede</hi>
can better tell you than I what expreſſions of his contentment he made her,
and how much beholding hee thought himſelfe to her for being willing to
grant him this favour; how in order he purſued that buſineſſe, and what vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
he obtain'd; but this I can tell you, that he found farre leſſe reſiſtance
than he expected, and for an acknowledgement gave her the chaine: then
<hi>Harpalice</hi> returning to take her away in the ſame darkneſſe, they parted aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with a thouſand proteſtations, and as many kiſſes after them. <hi>Palamede</hi>
was not at liberty till the company were gone away, and then <hi>Harpalice</hi> ask'd
him if ſhe knew not well how to oblige a man: hee gave her many thankes,
and a preſent, and then went his way very well ſatisfied. I know not, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
<hi>Melintus,</hi> addreſſing him to <hi>Epicharis,</hi> but looking upon <hi>Palamede,</hi> if I
may dare to tell you what fault he committed. I pray you, ſaid <hi>Palamede,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
nothing befell me, no nor our combat neither, for if it were not for that,
the ſtory would be nothing worth, and ſhould have nothing to follow upon
it, or elſe you ſhall oblige me to take up the diſcourſe where you left. I will
tell you then, replied <hi>Melintus,</hi> that he was not able to conceale this favour,
but publiſh'd it. <hi>Eriphile</hi> was advertis'd of that vanity of his, and acquainting
me with it, ſeem'd to be very ſenſibly diſpleas'd withall. I loved her with ſo
honeſt an affection, that I was touch'd as much as ſhe, ſo as I was reſolv'd to
revenge her. The day after I met him in the Parke for exerciſes, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to a place where we could not be ſeene, I told him he had ſpoken ill
of a Lady, that he muſt unſay it now preſently, and publiſh the contrary, or
elſe I ſhould very ſoone make him repent it. And I will make thee, ſaid he,
have but a ſhort time to repent thee of thoſe words. Then we both took our
ſwords in hand, and being but ſo lately learned in all the ſlights of fencing,
we were not to ſeeke for any one either at ſtriking or defending. It ſeem'd
we were both well content this occaſion was offered to put our art into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
ſo as if heretofore we had an emulation when we fought but for exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
wee were at this time farre otherwiſe provok'd, when wee conſidered
the prize and hazard to be as much as our honour and life. After this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
had beene a long time debated without any hurt on either party, <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
impatient that it held ſo long, gave me a blow with ſuch fury, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
avoyded it, his foot fail'd him, and he came falling cloſe to mee. I caſt
my ſelfe upon him, and ſeizing his ſword, I would have forced him to unſay
that he had invented againſt <hi>Eriphile:</hi> but he told me with a courage undan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that he would never unſay a truth. I threatned to kill him if he continued
thoſe words, whereupon he ſaid to me, <hi>Melintus,</hi> I confeſſe it was not well
done of me to ſpeake of it, but if I let you ſee how ſhee favours me, will you
not then avow that I have no reaſon to unſay it? If you can, ſaid I to him,
juſtifie it, I will confeſſe my ſelfe vanquiſh'd by you: but if this be not ſo, I
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7768:60"/>
will oblige you to give me ſatisfaction before her, and to publiſh the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
I agree, ſayd he, to theſe conditions, with an oath to content you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
theſe three dayes: then I let him riſe, and we went thus happily away,
without having any bloud one of another.</p>
                  <p>One day after he intreated <hi>Harpalice</hi> to let him have once againe the ſame
commodity of ſeeing <hi>Eriphile:</hi> She that aſpir'd to nothing but his preſents,
promis'd him; and the next day ſhe bade him come at night. Inſtantly he
comes to me &amp; tels me, I have found out the means to be as good as my word;
this evening if you come with the company to <hi>Harpalice's</hi> houſe, marke into
what Chamber <hi>Eriphile</hi> enters without a light; afterwards you may ſee me
come out from thence, if you ſtay the laſt in the houſe. I was a little amaz'd,
and could not tell if I were to ſuſpect <hi>Eriphile</hi> or no: Nevertheleſſe I promis'd
him to be there, and without ſpeaking a word to <hi>Eriphile,</hi> I accompanied
her thither at night. <hi>Harpalice</hi> fail'd not to bring him the ſame woman, that
was as courteous to him, as before: For my part that never left <hi>Eriphile</hi> in
the company, I mock'd at <hi>Palamede</hi> within my ſelfe, and went home with
her, never ſtaying for him. The day after, he came to mee in the morning,
and ask'd me, why I ſtayed not for him the laſt night, to ſee him come out.
Becauſe, ſaid I to him, I was all the while with <hi>Eriphile,</hi> and could well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for her. He began to laugh, but ſeeing me mocke him alſo, hee began
to miſtruſt <hi>Harpalice:</hi> then he told me, one of us muſt needs be finely cooze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
My eyes, ſaid I, are very certaine. Truly, replies he, mine could ſtand
me in no ſtead in the place where I was, for it was too obſcure: but yet I will
have all cleared before I have done, and without ſaying any thing elſe to me
went out, and goes to <hi>Harpalice's,</hi> and bound her by the ſame charmes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
to let him have the ſame favour once againe. She told him it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to have her company ſo often: nevertheleſſe ſhee would make her
come, provided he kept the agreement that there might bee no light in the
Chamber, for <hi>Eriphile</hi> was afraid ſo much as to be ſeene of thoſe of her owne
houſe: that made him miſtruſt her more than before, yet hee was content;
and when it was night, he repair'd to the ſame Chamber, where this woman
being entred, in the middeſt of their kindneſſes one to other, he cut off ſome
of her haire; and for all ſhe felt him, and would have hindered him from
keeping it, yet he carried it away by force. As ſoone as he was at his lodging,
and could get a light, he went to ſee in trembling what he held, and found it
was blacke haire, quite differing from <hi>Eriphile's.</hi> Then acknowledging how
he had beene coozened, and thinking how to be reveng'd upon <hi>Harpalice,</hi> he
paſs'd away the reſt of the night in great vexation. In the morning he came
to ſee me, and ſaid, <hi>Melintus,</hi> I am ready to give you ſatisfaction, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
what I have publiſh'd againſt <hi>Eriphile's</hi> honour: but this muſt needs be
done in her preſence. I ſent to know if ſhe were pleas'd to receive this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
which ſhe ſeem'd very willing to, upon condition I were at it.
<hi>Palamede</hi> entring, went and caſt himſelfe downe at her feet, and ſaid to her,
Madam, I am come to demand your pardon for the fault I have committed
againſt you, and vengeance for a villany that gave occaſion to my offence.
<hi>Eriphile</hi> prayed him to riſe, that hee might with more eaſe relate to her what
he had to ſay. She made us ſit downe, and then <hi>Palamede</hi> ſhewing what hee
had cut off, ſaid to her; Madam, theſe blacke haires ſhall let you ſee the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7768:61"/>
villany that was e're invented againſt two perſons; and thereupon hee
repeated to us all the crafty devices of <hi>Harpalice,</hi> which <hi>Eriphile</hi> and I were
in great admiration at. In the end he craved ſo many pardons, and added ſo
many proteſtations of honouring her, and publiſhing in all places <hi>Harpalice's</hi>
cunning deceits, with an exceſſe of ſubmiſſions and reſpects, that wee were
more content at his ſatisfactions, than wee thought our ſelves wronged by
his offence. <hi>Eriphile</hi> gave him a full pardon, and when ſhe knew of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
for her ſake, ſhe would make us friends, and have us continue ſo, ſince
we were of the ſame City, of the ſame age, and equally given to the ſame
honeſt exerciſes. I endur'd no great intreaty, for I had an high eſteeme of all
<hi>Palamedes</hi> qualities. And he expreſt to us, how happy hee accounted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
for drawing this advantage, as he call'd it, from his owne folly. We em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
one another, and ſware before her a perpetuall friendſhip: ſhe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
made <hi>Harpalice</hi> be brought into the hands of Juſtice, and the wretch
was condemn'd to be tyed to an Aſſe, her head turn'd to the taile, which
ſhe was to hold for a bridle, and ſo to be walk'd through all <hi>Athens,</hi> the
Hang-man whipping her, and children following her throwing of ſtones.
Since that time <hi>Palamede</hi> rendred ſo many honeſt offices to <hi>Eriphile,</hi> that ſhe
much eſteem'd him: ſhe diſpens'd her favours equally to us, never ceaſing
to make us confirme our friendſhip. And upon that occaſion <hi>Palamede</hi> made
Verſes, which I beleeve I can call to minde: I thinke they were theſe:</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>
                        <hi>I</hi> Love, but with the pureſt paſſion,</l>
                     <l>The perfectest that's here below.</l>
                     <l>The god that wounded me hath no compaſsion</l>
                     <l>To heale ſo ſweet a ſore, nor would I have it ſo.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>She loves me, and I dare not attend her</l>
                     <l>But for one favour to be bleſt;</l>
                     <l>Letting her ſelfe be lov'd, ſhe knowes how to defend her</l>
                     <l>By that ſame vertue onely makes me love her best.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>One rivall there alike is placed,</l>
                     <l>Which makes me no way jealous-hearted;</l>
                     <l>Nor am I griev'd that he, as well as I, is graced</l>
                     <l>To ſee ſo little good betweene us both imparted.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>To me alone I would not winne her;</l>
                     <l>Nor doe I cruelty pretend:</l>
                     <l>And yet 'tis not for want either of beauties in her,</l>
                     <l>Or paſsion in my heart, that equally contend.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>I perceive, ſaid <hi>Epicharis</hi> to <hi>Melintus,</hi> that you were both a modeſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and an honeſt friend, thus to make part in the friendſhip of this faire
<hi>Eriphile.</hi> You ſee, anſwer'd <hi>Melintus,</hi> how we have alwayes parted betweene
us, as well our good, as evill fortune: But I muſt tell you how wee divided
to our ſelves alſo almoſt all the honour of the Olympicke games: Then he
goes on: The time of them being at hand, there came to <hi>Piſa</hi> from all parts,
<pb facs="tcp:7768:61"/>
ſome to appeare in the exerciſes, and diſpute prizes; others to be ſpectators
onely. I would aſpire to a very high honour: for ſeeing that the greateſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Greece,</hi> and ſome Kings likewiſe had ſent excellent horſes with light
Chariots to carry away the prize of the race, I had a minde alſo to come
upon the liſts for <hi>Syracuſe:</hi> and having a long time before prepared <hi>Ephialtes</hi>
horſes and my owne for this occaſion, and made a gilt Chariot, glittering all
over, and repreſenting that of the Sunne, I made ſix faire Courſers I had
be painted, in a faſhion that had never beene ſeene before: then dreſt like
<hi>Apollo,</hi> and crown'd with rayes, I appear'd in the liſts with others that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
neither gliſtering ſhewes, nor magnificence: <hi>Palamede</hi> was contented to
pretend to the prize of the Harpe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eriphile,</hi> to encourage us both to well-doing, had given each of us a favour,
to <hi>Palamede</hi> a Harpe, whereon he was to play; and to me a Quiver, with the
Scarfe of her owne working. Every one of thoſe that were to runne, drave
his Chariot round about the place where the games were had, and ſaluted
the Ladies in paſſing by, of whom they receiv'd favours too, and good wiſhes;
then went to range himſelfe in the place that had beene ordain'd him. I had
learn'd my horſes this before, to ſtart at the third time the Trumpets ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
without needing to hearten them either with the whip, or with the
voyce, reſerving theſe ſpurres till the middle of the Courſe. They failed
not to ſtart in time, and orderly ruling them at firſt, I drave ſlylie betweene
two that violently went away at the beginning, and were afore mee, and
having this advantage, I contented my ſelfe to keepe cloſe to them, untill
about the end of the race, ſeeing them ſtrive to overtake mee, I ſpared my
horſes no more, but giving them the reines, and leaving the reſt behinde
me, I ſwiftly finiſh'd my courſe, gaining a victory that could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted.
Then the Trumpets from all parts began to ſound, and next
followed the cryes and applauſes of the people, and afterward I was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
Victor. Having receiv'd the prize, I repaſs'd againe into the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of the place as it were in triumph, and ſeeing they went about to begin
other games, I guided my Chariot neare to the Theater, where the verſes
were to be diſputed; from thence I leap'd up, where they gave me the firſt
ranke, becauſe of the victory I came from winning. I recited an Ode that
would be but tedious to repeat now to you, for it was very long. In the end
I carried away the prize there too, and having heard a little after <hi>Palamede</hi>
to be proclaimed Victor for the Harpe, I aſſure you I had more joy at it, than
for my owne victories.</p>
                  <p>Preſently after, thoſe of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> having underſtood the honour we had
acquir'd, ſent us Letters of acknowledgement, and thanks, and invited us
to returne to them, to receive the honours they deſir'd to give us. Wee
could not refuſe ſo juſt intreaties, and ſo advantageous for our ſelves,
and ſo tooke reſolution to depart, with a great deale of ſorrow to leave
<hi>Eriphile.</hi> I will not tell you of the trouble ſhee was in to heare this purpoſe
of ours: but ſhee expreſſed more diſpleaſure to me, than the wiſdome of
her minde could ſuffer: and I confeſſe to you alſo, that to be ſeparated
from her, I was to have a great power over my ſelfe: for I had lived
with her in ſo great a ſweetneſſe of converſation, and ſuch a confidence,
that now I went to deprive my ſelfe of many pleaſures and conſolations:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7768:62"/>
Her vertue and her good qualities had alwayes furniſh'd me with ſo profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and delightfull entertainments, that I made a doubt, if ever I ſhould
chance to be ſo happy againe, or meet with any thing that came neare that
ſtate I was to loſe by quitting her: Nevertheleſſe I muſt have conſented to
this depart; and <hi>Palamede,</hi> that apprehends, as you know, his comforts and
divertments ſo eaſily, had ſome regret for it in the beginning, but ſoone gave
it over. But in ſtead of returning to our Countrey, the heat of the warre
carried us away. <hi>Corbulo,</hi> that ſage and victorious Roman Captaine came to
land upon the Coaſts of <hi>Greece,</hi> with the forces he lead, to paſſe from thence
into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and make warre with the <hi>Parthians.</hi> Wee tooke this occaſion to
ſhew our valour, and went to finde him: then wee followed him in all the
Conqueſts he made, where we gained ſome renowne; and when the
peace was concluded, we ſeparated our ſelves from the Army. And doe
you ſpeake ſo ſlightly, ſaid <hi>Epicharis</hi> interrupting him, of a valour admired
of all the Empire, and ſo dreadfull to the <hi>Barbarians?</hi> I will have you rela<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e
to me what exploits you both atchieved, for 'twill be the greateſt pleaſure I
can poſſibly receive. Give me leave, anſwer'd <hi>Melintus,</hi> not to goe on with
that ſtory of battels and ſieges, that cannot but be irkſome to you, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the very termes of expreſſing them are unknowne to you. Content you
onely with this, that we had the victory in many encounters, were hurt in
others, ran many hazards our ſelves, and made others run as many, and in
the end the Romans remain'd victorious. I ſee well, ſaid <hi>Epicharis,</hi> I ſhall
for the preſent gather no advantage from your modeſty, but ſome day or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I will put you in minde, that you are not releas'd of this relation: Goe
on now onely with what hapned to you at your returne.</p>
                  <p>Having left the Army, replied <hi>Melintus,</hi> we embark'd us, and came to paſſe
neere unto <hi>Greece,</hi> I would have turn'd out of the way to goe to <hi>Athens,</hi>
and ſee <hi>Eriphile</hi> once againe; <hi>Palamede</hi> that had now quite forgot her, would
by no meanes endure that, and thought of nothing but the reception was
to be made us at <hi>Syracuſe</hi> for our Olympicke victories, which was more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
for us, than we could have imagin'd. I have heard, ſaid <hi>Epicharis,</hi>
of that reception, from her mouth that gave you the preſents; but though it
were magnificent, I may tell you it ſurpaſs'd not the merit of the perſons
were receiv'd. And this is that, continued <hi>Melintus,</hi> you deſir'd to know of
me, which is but a very poore ſatisfaction for all thoſe obligations I have to
you: but it ſuffices me that you are content what payment ſoever I give
you. You are too good a pay-maſter, ſaid <hi>Epicharis,</hi> and I am to bee very
well ſatisfied; ſince in waiting on you I have already ſo much pleaſure, and
beſides you have given me for my ſervice ſo pleaſing a recompence: for I
never heard any thing with ſo much joy, as that of your excellent and happy
inſtruction, the wiſdome of <hi>Eriphile,</hi> the coozening of <hi>Palamede,</hi> and the
birth of your friendſhips, together with all your honours, and your glories;
and if I often ſpent ſuch houres, I ſhould account my life moſt happy.</p>
                  <p>They were a long time entertaining them with all thoſe adventures, and
went on diſcourſing thus untill the Sunne was very high: then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
into a private place that was our of the way. <hi>Palamede</hi> went all alone
to the next Village for ſome proviſion, and left <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Epicharis</hi> that
were diſcourſing a while concerning the gentile qualities of <hi>Palamede,</hi> in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7768:62"/>
whom they acknowledg'd many things that proceeded from a lovely wit,
and a great nobleneſſe of heart: as for his humour that was merry, and
ſomething addicted to pleaſures; they confeſt that would ſoone be ripe
in him, and given over, and eſteem'd him never a whit the leſſe for it: then
<hi>Melintus</hi> counſell'd <hi>Epicharis</hi> to repoſe her a while, that they might travell
after, not thinking it dangerous any more to goe by day. As <hi>Palamede</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
<hi>Melintus</hi> made him a ſigne not to wake her, but to ſleepe too, that they
might merrily after goe away together.</p>

at laſt hid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves with their horſes in the den of the <hi>Cumaean</hi> Sibyll. <hi>Epicharis</hi>
was ſomething fearful to goe into it, having heard tell of many ſtrange things
that happened in that place, and how the Sibyll had from thence led <hi>Aeneas</hi>
into Hell: Nevertheleſſe, after <hi>Melintus</hi> had aſſured her that thoſe were but
fabulous ſtories, ſhe was the boldeſt of the company, and put her ſelfe the

depth of this den, and being a good way off from <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede,</hi>
ſhe heard ſome complaints comming out as it were from the moſt hollow
ſecret places of the Cave: She ſtarted backe for feare, and ran towards <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi>
whom ſhe tooke by the arme, and thought her ſelfe then well fortified:
ſhe told him the cauſe of her being frighted; they came neare to heare what
it might be, and perceiv'd avoyce that ſpake, which made them judge they
were, it may be, theeves that were retir'd thither: but lending their eare more
attentively, they heard theſe words; Ah Fortune, how trecherous art thou!
and how more advantageous is it to be miſerable at firſt, than happy, ſince
thou art ſo changeable. How cruell were the favours thou gaveſt me, ſince
they ſerv'd for nothing but to bring upon me the more ſorrow; and how
malicious wert thou to place me in a condition worthy of envy, for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

can I expect it? Of men? they have abandon'd me: Of the heavens? they
have none to give: Of the earth? ſhe ſcarce affords me this retreat: And of
the Sea? ſhe refus'd me the ſuccours I hoped from her, when I ſought my
death in her boſome. Alas, Love, what wouldſt thou have mee doe? doeſt

himſelfe. You know not, anſwered hee, to what a deſperation may bring
one; and if you knew that which belong'd to a Lover, you would ſoone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
theſe extravagances. Then they heard how hee went on; But ſeeing I
muſt ſuffer, Courage, let us againe put the iron into our wounds. Cruell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances,
I provoke you, to the end you might againe hurt mee with
your moſt ſenſible prickings. Sweet entertainment, deare confidence agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
pleaſures, heretofore the joyes, now the executioners of my ſoule; and
you Oaths of love that ought to be inviolable, come to me traytors; and if
there remaines any place in me to murther, ſpare not your rudeſt blowes
there: teare me with rage, deſpite, and ſhame, and make my ſufferance as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,
as the love that cauſes it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epicharis</hi> admir'd the tranſport of this wretched man, and the violence of
his evill that forc'd him to deſpaire thus: and a while after hee continued
ſtill: It ſeemes I hope to eaſe my griefes by theſe unuſefull words: but how
unpowerfull are they for ſuch an exceſſe of evils; and to what purpoſe
ſerve theſe plaints, when all things are deafe to me? and though they were
willing to give mee ſome remedy, yet it is now impoſſible. Ah ye gods!
What make you in heaven? and how doe you caſt off men to ſo many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?
to what end are our incenſe and our ſacrifices, ſeeing the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
are the moſt miſerable? for I will no longer beleeve you take care of
us: What viſible aſſiſtance receive we of you? What is become of the help
of your Oracles for the diſtreſſed? Are we more wicked than our fathers,
to whom you gave ſometimes by your advice, either a remedy, or at leaſt
a comfort? And thou, holy <hi>Sibyl,</hi> whoſe dwelling I take poſſeſſion of, if
it be true that thou art no more but a voyce, why doſt thou not make it
ſpeake in my favour? And why wilt thou not favour mee with ſome one of
thy prophecies, to teach mee what conſolation, or what end I ought to
hope for?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epicharis</hi> told <hi>Melintus,</hi> ſhee had pitty upon that poore Lover, and that
ſhe was reſolv'd to counterfeit the <hi>Sibyl's</hi> voyce, to make him have a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to goe to his kinred againe, amongſt whom he might more eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
his wits. <hi>Melintus</hi> approved her invention; but ſhe told him ſhe muſt
ſpeake in verſe, and that ſhe could not make any. <hi>Melintus</hi> anſwered, make
haſte, and pronounce aloud the verſes I ſhall tell you in your eare, and ſay
every one after me, which ſhe did thus with a very ſhrill voyce:</p>
               <l>Lover of Conſtancy undaunted,</l>
               <l>Thou ſhalt perceive thy griefes decay,</l>
               <l>If thou return'st without delay</l>
               <l>Where thy birth to thee was granted.</l>
               <p>The poore man having heard this voyce, and making no doubt but it was
the <hi>Sibyl's,</hi> fell downe upon his knees, and cried out; Sacred <hi>Sibyl,</hi> I give
thee thankes for the pitty thou haſt had of my miſeries: I ſhall follow thy
advice, for thy holy voyce hath beene ever true, and if by thy helpe my life
ſhall prove more fortunate, thou from that time ſhalt be the onely Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
I will adore. Onely ſuffer me but this night to abide within thy grotte.
I would be glad to finde a little ſleepe here, which I have alwayes denied
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7768:64"/>
my ſelf, and to morrow will I begin my courſe to goe ſeeke out the effect of
thy Oracle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Epicharis</hi> were pleas'd to ſee their device ſucceed ſo well:
but <hi>Palamede</hi> told them; If you deſire he ſhould perfectly beleeve this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
he muſt not heare us ſpeake, nor finde us in this place tomorrow. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picharis</hi>
ſaid, ſhe was of opinion they were beſt goe out, being not well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
neither to ſleepe in that den, and that ſhe deſir'd rather to paſſe away
the night in the ſhadow of ſome trees, where ſhe ſhould be leſſe afraid. They
tooke that reſolution, and when they were got out, ſate them downe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
poplers, where they tyed their horſes too. The next day <hi>Palamede</hi> went
to the Port of <hi>Cajetta,</hi> to ſee if ſome veſſell were not to ſet ſaile, that might
take them in for <hi>Sicily: Melintus</hi> and <hi>Eurylas</hi> ſaw paſſing by them a very pale
man, with a wandring looke; but yet that ſeem'd of a good mine, and to
have ſome ſatisfaction in his minde; although the eſtate wherein he was did
not promiſe any great reaſon for it. He came towards them from the <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and they tooke him to be the very ſame they had heard there, to
whom <hi>Epicharis</hi> had given the Oracle, that might be the occaſion of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.
<hi>Eurylas</hi> had a good minde, he would have ſtayed by them to have
knowne his fortune: but he went off, farre away, when he perceived them,
to avoyd the encountring of mankinde: and though <hi>Eurylas</hi> call'd to ſpeak
with him, yet he ſtill continued his way in a very feeble pace. What would you
learne, ſaid <hi>Melintus</hi> to her, the world is full of theſe Love-traverſes; he is
ſo eager to depart becauſe of your Oracle, that there is no likelihood hee
would ſtay his journey for us: and if he be ſoundly in love, he will never tell
you his fortune; for I judge of him by my ſelfe, that in the like occaſion would
not publiſh my affaires to all I met.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epicharis</hi> looking on <hi>Melintus,</hi> ask'd him, If you were in love, would you
not have a friend to be confident in? I never knew any yet, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> I
durſt be aſſur'd of in ſo important a ſecret. And doe you not thinke, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
ſhe, <hi>Palamede</hi> loves you enough, not to deceive you? I ſhould doe
an injury, ſaid he, to doubt of it; but he might be deceiv'd himſelfe, and
not thinking any thing, diſcover that which I ſhould have much adoe to keep
ſecret my ſelfe. And what would you thinke of me, replies <hi>Epicharis,</hi> that
I might be brought to reveale any thing, if you had truſted me with a ſecret
that was to be kept with diſcretion? I confeſſe to you, anſwered <hi>Melintus,</hi>
that you are the onely perſon I dare be confident of, for a thing that were
ſo deare to me. Let it not grieve you then, ſaid ſhe, taking hold of his hand,
that I am acquainted with the whole ſecret of your life; but live moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for all that, that I would rather ſuffer death, than one word to be drawne
from me of that you deſire ſhould be conceal'd. And becauſe thereupon
he ſtood ſtill in a great amazement, ſhe added; <hi>Melintus,</hi> I had not ſo freely
ſpoken to you, but that I am reſolv'd to employ my life at your ſervice: and
I deſire you to beleeve there is not a man I honour ſo much as I doe you, and
that my minde ſhall never be contented, unleſſe yours be ſo too, ſince your
intereſts ſo neerely concerne thoſe of my Miſtreſſe. <hi>Melintus</hi> ſeeing how
ſhe knew ſo much as ſhe did, ſaid to her; Is it poſſible, <hi>Epicharis,</hi> ſhe ſhould
tell you any thing of this? for I beleeve you have perceiv'd nothing by
me, not ſo much as from my eyes. Doe not ſeeke to informe your ſelfe, ſaid
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7768:64"/>
ſhe, how I come to know it, let it ſuffice I am not ignorant either what you
are, or how vertuouſly you love her; and I have no greater joy than when
I hope my ſervices may be of ſome uſe to you. Then is my ſoule, anſwered
<hi>Melintus,</hi> and my life in your hands: but I am not ſorry for it, aſſuring you
that next unto her there is not a perſon I eſteeme as I doe you, nor of whom
I deſire more to be eſteemed. <hi>Melintus,</hi> replide ſhee, beleeve this, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
I have to you are not of the common ſort; and if I doe you no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
great ſervices, the fault ſhall not be for want of employing all
the powers are in me. I well know, ſaid he, what you are capable of, and I
ſhall thinke my ſelfe happy in this onely, that your will is good. <hi>Palamedes</hi>
returne brake off that diſcourſe, who came to tell them there was never a
Ship in the harbour, and that there was none expected there; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
they determined to continue in that deſart place untill there might ſome
arrive. About Noone <hi>Epicharis</hi> walking about, met with a little houſe that
leaned againſt the backe of the mountaine, whereinto entring, ſhee found
an old man and his wife of the ſame yeares, that got their living by making
certaine houſhold commodities of wood, which they carried to ſell at <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae.</hi>
After ſhe had inquir'd of their manner of life, ſhe perceiv'd they had
two or three beds, and ask'd them if they had any children. Preſently the
teares came into the eyes of theſe good people, and <hi>Epicharis</hi> deſirous to
know the cauſe of their diſpleaſure; they told her they had lately but one
daughter remaining alive, whoſe husband dying a yeare agoe, left her two
children, and about a moneth ſince having them in the wood with her, a
ſhee-wolfe carried them away to be devour'd, after ſhee had ſtrangled the
mother. <hi>Epicharis</hi> lamented with them that accident, and to ſtay their wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
gave them ſome money: then ſhe ask'd them if they would lend her
the beds they had to ſpare for two or three dayes. They offer'd her all their
houſe, and <hi>Epicharis</hi> well content that ſhee had found out a lodging whileſt
they could depart, went to advertiſe <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> of her adventure,
and brought them to this poore houſe where they accommodated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as well as they might. They lived on that they brought day by day
from <hi>Cumae;</hi> and one while <hi>Melintus,</hi> another while <hi>Palamede</hi> went a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe
to the Port to ſee if there were any veſſell come. They paſſed thus
eight or ten dayes with much incommodity and wearineſſe: for this ſtay was
very grievous, and deferr'd great joyes as well from them, as from thoſe they
deſir'd to deliver out of paine in <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One day as <hi>Palamede</hi> was at the Port of <hi>Cajette,</hi> hee perceiv'd a man a
horſebacke that look'd upon him all aſtoniſhed: he knew him to be <hi>Arcas,</hi>
and brought his horſe cloſe to his, to embrace him. The poore <hi>Arcas</hi> was
ſo confounded, that he durſt not yet be ſure it was <hi>Palamede;</hi> and ſaid to
him; Alas! and is it you I am ſeeking for dead, and doe I finde you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving?
'Tis not a ſhadow, anſwered <hi>Palamede,</hi> thou ſeeſt, but the good friend
of thy Maſters. And what is become of him, replies <hi>Arcas?</hi> Hee is not
very farre from hence, anſwers <hi>Palamede,</hi> and I long very much till hee ſee
thee. <hi>Arcas</hi> not able to recollect himſelfe out of his amazedneſſe, <hi>Palamede</hi>
prayd him to come away to goe to <hi>Melintus.</hi> The gods, ſaves <hi>Arcas,</hi> favour
all your deſignes for the good newes you tell mee: alas! does my Maſter
then live ſtill, and have the gods had care of your innocency? I thinke the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7768:65"/>
time long ere I ſee him and embrace his knees, after ſo many feares and
griefes that tormented me when I thought him dead. They went on then in
their way to goe to <hi>Melintus;</hi> and in the meane time <hi>Palamede</hi> knew that his
father and his ſiſter were happily arriv'd at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and had nothing elſe to
trouble them, but the extreme diſpleaſure for leaving him in ſo great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
But <hi>Arcas</hi> reſerv'd the report of the voyage he had made ſince their
landing at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> where he had preſently left them to returne to helpe
his Maſter, if he might be ſo happy as to come to him in time. They went
in ſuch haſte, that they were ſoone come to the little houſe where <hi>Melintus</hi>
and <hi>Eurylas</hi> being at the doore, and ſeeing a man comming with <hi>Palamede</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre
off, knew not what to thinke: but when they ſaw 'twas <hi>Arcas,</hi> they
went for joy to meet him. He caſt him downe at his Maſters feet, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
his legges, without being able to take himſelfe off. Alas! ſaid he, my
deare Maſter, doe I ſee you once againe? <hi>Melintus</hi> ſtooped downe alſo for
to embrace him, and with exceſſe of contentment held his head with both
his hands: at laſt he ask'd him how they did at <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> Very well, anſwered
<hi>Arcas,</hi> and when they ſhall ſee you againe alive, they will doe better yet:
But, went he on with a great ſigh, how is't poſſible you eſcap'd out of the
Tower? By the aſſiſtance of this young man, ſayes <hi>Palamede,</hi> ſhewing him
<hi>Eurylas,</hi> to whom we are beholding for our lives. Oh! ſaid hee regarding
him, how he has gain'd him the gods and men for his friends, by ſo happy an
action. <hi>Eurylas</hi> laughed that <hi>Arcas</hi> ſhould not yet know him. <hi>Melintus</hi> and
<hi>Palamede</hi> too admir'd his abuſe; in the end <hi>Melintus</hi> ask'd if hee had never
ſeene any thing that reſembled <hi>Eurylas:</hi> No, ſayes he, if it were not <hi>Epicha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
and at the ſame time knew her, and went to ſalute her: Then were they
impatient to know what his fortune had beene. As ſoone, ſayes he, as I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
in the haven of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> I ſaw a ſhip that was departing for <hi>Italy:</hi> and
I intreated <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Ariana</hi> to give leave that I might returne to ſuccour
you; which they were very willing to, and the ſame houre I re-imbark'd,
and in three dayes ſpace with no good fortune landed at the Port of <hi>Oſtia:</hi>
from thence finding this horſe, I went till I came at <hi>Rome,</hi> following the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and at my firſt entrance ſaw much people running to ſee ſome ſtrange
thing. I was then curious of newes, and ſought to learne what was become
of you; and hoping that ſome one amongſt that confuſion might tell mee
ſomething of you, I followed thoſe that went in this haſte: but I heard of
them newes more unfortunate than I would have deſir'd to know: for
being upon the banke of the Tyber, with the reſt that ran thither, they told
me that two <hi>Sicilians</hi> that ſhould have beene condemn'd that very day by
the Senate, had caſt themſelves downe into the river from the top of the
Tower where they were kept priſoners. Judge you what could become of
me then; but when I was told your names, and knew my miſery to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
I cannot relate to you neither my complaints nor my deſpaires: in
the end I reſolv'd with my ſelfe to give my aſſiſtance to ſome that might
ſearch for the bodies in the bottome of the water, to give you buriall at the
leaſt: but all our labour being proved in vaine, and thinking that the ſtreame
had carried you away, I tooke in hand to follow the courſe of the river, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
which I wandred ſome dayes, to ſee if the water had not caſt you upon
ſome ſhore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7768:65"/>
I went then againe to <hi>Oſtia</hi> without hearing any newes of that I deſir'd,
ſo as deſpairing to finde your bodies at all, I determin'd to returne into <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi>
alwayes coaſting along the Sea-ſhore, to ſee if peradventure you had
not beene caſt upon ſome banke. Purſuing this ſad deſigne, I arriv'd at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jette,</hi>
where I found <hi>Palamede,</hi> whoſe happy encounter chang'd my woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
into an exceſſe of contentment: But, continued hee, may I not know
how this handſome youth was ſo happy as to ſave you? Then <hi>Palamede</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to him all her pretty inventions to get into the priſon, and the ſtrange
fortunes of their comming out, which <hi>Arcas</hi> liſtned to with much admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
At laſt it was concluded they ſhould ſtay no longer in that place, but
gaine (along the Sea-ſide) the Port of <hi>Reggium,</hi> where they would not faile
to finde ſhipping; and when they had taken leave of their hoſts, and well
rewarded them, they got up a horſebacke, and fear'd no more to lodge in any
houſes, ſince <hi>Arcas</hi> had aſſur'd them there was no more ſearch made for them,
but that they were thought to be dead.</p>
               <p>The places they paſſed through were very troubleſome; for coaſting the
Sea they met with many mountaines and vallies, and the greateſt part of the
wayes were of a tedious circuit. That was the cauſe they advanc'd ſo little,
conſidering the great deſire they had to get out of <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Melintus,</hi>
who impatient of ſeeing <hi>Ariana</hi> againe, curs'd inceſſantly this length of a
voyage; and one day entertaining his thoughtfulneſſe, upon that ſubject he
made theſe Verſes:</p>

               </lg>
               <p>The continuall entertainments of this troop were ſo delightfull, that they
were ſufficiently diverted; and had it not beene for the extreme paſſion of
<hi>Melintus,</hi> that permitted him no contentment being abſent from <hi>Ariana,</hi> the
gentle humour of <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Eurylas</hi> had bin able to have diſpell'd his ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
and although he cover'd it, what he poſſibly could, yet hee gave not
over pleaſing himſelfe with often retiring into his thoughts, and by the
way of purpoſe ſeparated him from the company, now going before them,
another while leaving them ſome ſpace before him; having nothing more
deare than the remembrance of <hi>Ariana's</hi> favours which hee had receiv'd of
her by ſending him <hi>Epicharis;</hi> and he tooke it for a good Augury that his
Miſtreſſe had acquainted her with his paſſion, and what he was, there being
appearance that this diſcourſe was not made to his diſadvantage. He accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himſelfe more happy yet by much, for having this Wench ſo affectionate
to ſerve him, ſince ſhe was ſo neceſſary to him, and promis'd himſelfe at his
returne a great alteration in his fortune, ſeeing ſo many things contribute
to his contentment. If this voyage had beene yet farre longer, ſuch ſweet
entertainments as theſe would pleaſingly enough have buſied him, finding
ſo many cauſes to hope well; and when he ſaw his minde in ſo happy a ſtate,
he thought well to leave it ſo, and came with a cheerely looke to joyne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to the diſcourſes of the reſt, which he ever gave rule to as he pleaſed, by
vertue of the reaſons his wit furniſh'd him withall. At laſt they arriv'd at
<hi>Reggium,</hi> where they were not long without finding a veſſell, and going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord
it, in leſſe than an houre they loſt ſight of that land, where they had
runne ſo many fortunes, making a thouſand imprecations againſt it, and
<pb facs="tcp:7768:66"/>
all of them taking an oath never to ſee it more.</p>
               <p>Being arriv'd at <hi>Meſsina,</hi> they kiſſed their native ſoyle, and prayed it to
be more favourable to them: the next day they went away betimes, and
in three dayes journey came ſomething neare to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> but the night o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertooke
them: and the day after paſſing by the houſe <hi>Dicearchus</hi> had in the
Countrey, <hi>Palamede</hi> demanded if they would reſt them there, that he might
againe ſee the place where he had ſpent ſo ſweet houres with <hi>Epicharis. Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
liked not that motion, and ſaid they were not to loſe any time to goe to
<hi>Syracuſe.</hi> They continued their way, and came to a hill that was of a good
height, with a wood by it; and from thence they might begin to diſcover a
plaine they were to deſcend to, and the City of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus,</hi> who went ſome thirty paces before, perceiv'd three men afoot,
arm'd, and masked, that made goe along with much rudeneſſe an old man
with his eyes muffled, and forced him to enter into that wood. Hee ſpurr'd
his horſe to ſee what they would doe with that man, and came neere to them
juſt as they were going to kill him: ſuddenly he tooke his ſword in his hand,
and ſtriking from his horſe him that went to give the blow, hee overthrew
him to the ground: the two others ſet on him behinde, but turning about
towards them, with a reverſe blow he cleft the head of one of them, and laid
him dead in the place. The other came to him with a great deale of courage:
but <hi>Melintus</hi> made no great account of it, having but him to combat with,
and gave him foure or five ſound blowes with his ſword: in the meane time
he that was overthrowne had got up, and had ſhrewdly troubled <hi>Melintus,</hi>
but for <hi>Palamede,</hi> who having ſeene his friend goe galloping away, doubted
ſome encounter, and had followed him. He came in juſt as this laſt man was
comming to <hi>Melintus,</hi> and made no great matter to defeat him; for having
brought him to the ground the ſecond time, he trode on him with his horſe
feet, and ran him in three or foure places with his ſword, at the ſame time
that his friend had made an end of killing the other. <hi>Melintus</hi> preſently aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from his horſe, and tooke off their vizors to ſee if he might know them:
and he was ſtrangely aſtoniſh'd when he ſaw they were <hi>Garamant</hi> and <hi>Toxaris</hi>
their ancient enemies, whoſe treaſons they had now puniſh'd without thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of them: then he went towards the old man that had a venerable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
but was ſo out of all heart, expecting nothing but death, that hee
thought not of unbinding his owne eyes, though he were left alone to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
<hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> undid the napkin that covered his face, and
were in a great amaze to ſee that it was <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> who dazeled with the
light he ſo ſuddenly beheld, and having ſtill the image of death before his
eyes, ſaid to them; Alas! will you have me ſee my ſelfe dye too? Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
his ſight reſtoring him, he knew <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede,</hi> whom hee
thought dead; which made him ſtill more poſſeſt with trouble: not well
knowing whether he himſelfe had not beene already kill'd, and were now
with them in the Elizian fields; or whether their ſoules were not come to
ſuccour him. And that which caus'd in him thoſe doubts, was, that they
on their part were amazed too, and ſpake nothing: but at length <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
ſaid to him; Ah gods, my uncle, into what hands were you fallen?
Tell me rather, anſwers he, in what hands I am for the preſent in: for I
know not if I be among the dead or the living. We are not dead, ſayes
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7768:67"/>
                  <hi>Melintus,</hi> the gods have preſerv'd our lives to ſave yours this day; and I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
my good fortune for comming ſo timely in, when they were going to
ſtrike a dagger into your boſome. Was it you then, replied <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> that
hindered that misfortune? May the gods render you this benefit: but I
know not, but you may alſo ſuccour my neece <hi>Ariana,</hi> who is within this
valley in the hands of above twenty ſouldiers, with <hi>Ericine</hi> your ſiſter. Let
us goe, cried out <hi>Melintus,</hi> and keepe them from having any violence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them, and he would have parted that inſtant, but that <hi>Dicearchus</hi> ſaid
to him, Stay a while that we may adviſe what is to be done: I am certaine
they will doe them no harme, becauſe they ſtay for the returne of theſe you
have ſlaine; and then I ſhall have leiſure to tell you the occaſion of what is
hapned, to the end we may take counſell together: then they were ſilent,
and he goes on: You muſt know that this man, ſhewing <hi>Garamant,</hi> ſeeing
how <hi>Ariana</hi> my neece had a great eſtate, forbeing left ſole inheritrix of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtides</hi>
and me, by the death of <hi>Palamede</hi> which was thought moſt certaine,
was ſo inſolent as to make her be demanded in marriage by this other call'd
<hi>Toxaris,</hi> and who at the ſame time made himſelfe in love with <hi>Ericine</hi> your
ſiſter, ſaid he to <hi>Melintus.</hi> I excus'd me the faireſt way I could: but they
attributing this refuſe to contempt, made me at length be threatned, that
they would be reveng'd for this; and they had ſuch deſpight at it, that
this day, to cut you ſhort, having knowne how I was to goe to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
houſe with my neece, and <hi>Ericine</hi> that accompanied her, they way-laid
us at this vale, where having ſtaied the Charet we were in, they made mee
come downe with a great deale of inſolence, and were reſolv'd to come
to cut my throat in this wood; becauſe, ſaid they, I did alwayes ſeeke to
revenge me of them, and that if they would live at their caſe, I was to bee
taken out of the world. In this deſigne they gave charge to the other ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of their company to attend them, and keepe <hi>Ariana</hi> and <hi>Ericine</hi> well,
till they ſhould be come backe from hence; let us therefore ſee for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
what we have to doe: for albeit your valour be great, 'twill bee a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
matter to goe ſet upon ſo many men. It is no matter, ſayes <hi>Palamede,</hi> I
hope we ſhall amaze them, conſidering they have no more Commanders. I
am thinking, replies <hi>Melintus,</hi> on ſome other thing that will not be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe:
Let us put on the coats of Arms of theſe dead men, &amp; take their vizors,
and their falſe haire, and then goe to finde them out, they being never able
to doubt we be other than <hi>Toxaris</hi> and <hi>Garamant</hi> whom they ſtay for, and ſo
mingling our ſelves among them, we ſhall have kill'd a number of them, before
ever they be perceiv'd what we are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palamede</hi> found this invention to be very good, <hi>Dicearchus</hi> approv'd it too,
and <hi>Arcas</hi> being then arriv'd, <hi>Melintus</hi> bade him put upon him one of thoſe
Coats of Armes, as well as <hi>Palamede</hi> and he would doe, to goe execute that
they had reſolv'd on, whileſt <hi>Dicearchus</hi> and <hi>Eurylas</hi> in the meane time look'd
to their horſes.</p>
               <p>Thus they dreſt them all three in haſte, and tooke the Maſques and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruques,
and forgat not ſo much as the buskins: then <hi>Dicearchus</hi> wiſhing them
good fortune, let them depart, and went with <hi>Eurylas</hi> to put himſelfe into a
place whence they might perceive all that hapned, and never be ſeene. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
being in the mid-way of the deſcent to the vale, made a ſtand, and
<pb facs="tcp:7768:67"/>
ſaid to <hi>Palamede,</hi> I would never have thought of ſeeking any other meanes
but force againſt thoſe we are going to, if that in abandoning our owne, we
endanger'd not alſo the lives of our ſiſters, and their honour beſide, which
is more deare to them. I am of opinion therefore, that in conſideration of
them we let our valour altogether alone, and ſave them by a way more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and infallible. They we goe to ſeeke will never imagine wee be other
than their Captaines, and ſo we may command them what we pleaſe; and
I would adviſe, that comming neare the Chariot we have our naked ſwords
in our hand, bloudy as they be, as if we came from killing of <hi>Dicearchus;</hi> and
then putting them up into the ſcabberd, we may make ſigne to the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to attend us againe there; then we will take, you, ſaid he to <hi>Palamede,
Erycine,</hi> becauſe you are in the habit of <hi>Toxaris</hi> that would have taken her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
and I <hi>Ariana,</hi> becauſe I am dreſt like <hi>Garamant.</hi> Wee will make as if
we would carry them away into this ſame wood, not to deferre our content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
any longer, leaving the ſouldiers in the ſame place ſtill, and then come
with them to finde out <hi>Dicearchus</hi> and <hi>Eurylas;</hi> we ſhall have meanes good
enough to ſave our ſelves by riding upon our horſes to <hi>Dicearchus</hi> houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ever they ſuſpect any plot. This crafty device is very fine, ſayes <hi>Palamede,</hi>
and if my ſiſter and <hi>Erycine</hi> make any reſiſtance, we need but tell them in
their eare who we are. Nay contrary, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> we are to let them tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
us, to make the feigning ſeeme the better. That being approved, they
came downe the hill, and approach'd with aſſurance to theſe ſouldiers, who
at their arrive ſeparated, and made them way to paſſe to the Chariot. <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
ſeiz'd upon <hi>Ariana,</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> upon <hi>Erycine,</hi> and they ſpake aloud in
a counterfeit voyce like that comes out of a vizard: We will no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
ſatisfying us, ſince the meanes is now in our owne hands; this next
wood is very commodious for ſuch an occaſion. <hi>Ariana</hi> fell to crying out
and ſhriekings, but <hi>Melintus</hi> tooke her by force, after he had made a ſigne to
the ſouldiers to wait for them at the ſame place: but ſhe in ſtriving did what
ſhe could to teare his very face, and outraged him as much as her forces
would give her leave: then ſeeing that he held her hands in ſuch ſort, as ſhe
could neither defend her ſelfe any more, nor offend him: Ah cruell wretch,
ſaid ſhe, art thou not content to have kill'd my uncle, but thou muſt deſire
to take from me alſo that by force, which I cannot loſe without my life?
kill me, barbarous man, ſo ſhall not I much out-live my honour, nor thou
long time enjoy the fruits of thy inſolence. <hi>Erycine</hi> on the other ſide was
carried away by <hi>Palamede:</hi> but her ſoft nature permitted her nothing but
weeping and crying; and <hi>Arcas</hi> followed helping them, and forbidding the
Souldiers, that would have done that office, to ſtirre from thence. When they
were halfe way up the hill, <hi>Melintus</hi> ſtayed him to take breath, and <hi>Ariana</hi>
recollected new forces for to vex him, and hinder his getting up to the top:
but <hi>Melintus</hi> rendring all her ſtriving uſeleſſe, ſhee could not containe her
ſelfe from crying out; Ah poore <hi>Melintus,</hi> where art thou now? If thou wert
alive, thou wouldſt not have fail'd to be here at my reſcue, or elſe not much
ſurviv'd my diſaſter; but it ſhall not be long ere I come to thee, if not with
a pure body, at leaſt with a ſoule unſpotted; and thou, infamous goat, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thy ſelfe that the gods will revenge me, and not ſuffer thy fury to goe
unpuniſh'd. How ſweet were all theſe ſpeeches to <hi>Melintus?</hi> Never were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7768:68"/>
nor outrages ſo well receiv'd. By this time he had got to the height of
the mountaine, where <hi>Dicearchus</hi> came running; and <hi>Melintus</hi> having ſet her
upon her feet, tooke off his maſque, and let her ſee him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arian's</hi> aſtoniſhment were hard to be deſcrib'd, one while looking upon
<hi>Dicearchus,</hi> another while on <hi>Melintus,</hi> two perſons ſhe thought to have bin
dead, and not well knowing whether ſhe might thinke her ſelfe in ſafety, or
elſe in the hands of ſome ſpirits that had taken thoſe ſhapes to abuſe her, ſhe
waver'd betwixt joy and feare. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> ſaid to her, Make no doubt, neece,
of what you ſee: here are <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> whom you thought dead,
that have this day preſerv'd my life and your honour. <hi>Ariana</hi> at that newes
was taken with ſuch an exceſſe of joy and amazement, that ſhe loſt that little
ſtrength was left her, after all her ſtrivings: ſhe let her ſelfe goe into <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
armes, and fell lightly upon the graſſe: then with a ſoft voyce ſhee ſaid
to him; Ha <hi>Melintus,</hi> is it you indeed I ſee, or your demon that takes care
of me even after your death? Madam, anſwered <hi>Melintus,</hi> aſſure your ſelfe
that I am yet alive to ſerve you; but we are not to make any longer ſtay here,
if you deſire to ſecure you from the hands of theſe villaines. <hi>Ariana</hi> ſeeing
<hi>Palamede</hi> that held <hi>Erycine,</hi> call'd him, and ſaid, My deare brother, if you
deſire I ſhould not doubt of the good fortune they would perſwade me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
doe but ſo much as come hither that I may embrace you. Then <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
came to her; and <hi>Dicearchus</hi> ſeeing their kindneſſes laſt too long, put
<hi>Melintus</hi> in minde of getting a horſebacke, and that hee would take <hi>Erycine</hi>
with him. As for him he mounted upon <hi>Arcas</hi> his horſe, <hi>Palamede</hi> made <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
reſolve to be gone from that place, and to be ſet upon the ſame horſe with
him, and <hi>Arcas</hi> got up behind <hi>Eurylas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They determin'd to pace away, without any great precipitation, but in
caſe they were purſued, and get to <hi>Dicearchus</hi> houſe, the neereſt place they
could be ſafe in. <hi>Palamede</hi> ask'd his ſiſter if ſhe knew that handſome youth
with <hi>Arcas.</hi> I know very well, ſayes ſhee, that 'tis my deare <hi>Epicharis:</hi> but
I dare not before my uncle expreſſe to her the joy I have to ſee her: I doubt
not but ſhe hath aſſiſted you very carefully. Alas ſiſter, anſwered <hi>Palamede,</hi>
but for her we had beene now dead men, and that by a ſhamefull death too.
How ſo, replied ſhe? you may tell me by the way as we goe in what manner
you were preſerved: for every one beleeves here, you caſt your ſelves down
the Tower. They beleeve this too at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſayes he to her, and I ſhall make
you a relation of our happy, or rather miraculous getting out: but firſt tell
me why you are thus all in mourning clothes? Alas brother, anſwered ſhe,
the teares comming into her eyes, muſt I needs, for the ſuccours I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
of you to day, give you ſo ſad newes? Siſter, replide he, how I am
in feare for my father, upon the report of my death. Your feares, ſaid ſhee
to him, are to be turn'd into aſſurances: for hee was not able to reſiſt the
diſpleaſures he felt for the newes of your misfortune, being chiefly perplex'd
with the ſorrow for having left you, and calling himſelfe author of your
death, ſince he had abandon'd you. Then was ſome time ſpent in teares,
after which they told by courſe all that had befallen them, while they had
beene abſent from one another. <hi>Melintus</hi> entertaind <hi>Erycine</hi> too that was
rapt for joy to ſee this brother ſhee honoured ſo much; and hee learn'd of
her what had paſs'd at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> after hee had let her know in a few words
<pb facs="tcp:7768:68"/>
how he had beene ſaved. And <hi>Arcas</hi> gave <hi>Dicearchus</hi> a part of their adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as he went by his ſide, and thus they arriv'd at his houſe, where ſeeing
themſelves ſafe, their ſpirits were intirely ſenſible of joy, being no longer
diſtreſs'd with any feares. <hi>Melintus</hi> advis'd that the Ladies ſhould reſt them
whileſt they in the meane time tooke order to goe charge thoſe Souldiers
that remain'd, to get the baggage out of their hands. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> would by
no meanes they ſhould put themſelves into that danger: for that the men
were not worth their paines, the Chiefes being ſlaine, and the booty they
had, was but a ſmall matter. Notwithſtanding <hi>Melintus</hi> chang'd not his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
and hiding his purpoſe from <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> aſſembled, together with
<hi>Palamede,</hi> ſome Boores of the Countrey whom he made take Armes; and
taking on him to be their Captaine, led them on to goe finde thoſe Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
where of ſome of them, being impatient for that their men ſtayed ſo
long in the wood, had gone to ſee what they did there, and having found
them dead, they came backe againe to advertiſe their companions of it, juſt
when they were aſſaulted by <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede:</hi> ſome of them were
ſlaine, and they carried away five or ſix priſoners in the very Chariot, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> who receiv'd them as comming in triumph, with their
captives drawne in their traine. <hi>Ariana</hi> and <hi>Erycine</hi> roſe from their bed to ſee
what it was entred; and ſeeing out at the windowes <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi>
in the head of that Equipage, they admir'd their courage for not enduring
that any thing of theirs ſhould remaine in the hands of thoſe ſouldiers: and
the priſoners were ſurely guarded, to be carried to <hi>Syracuſe</hi> as ſoone as they
return'd thither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dicearchus</hi> acknowledging the obligation he had to <hi>Melintus,</hi> tooke him
aſide, and demanded of him if he could deſire nothing of him in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of the life he was indebted to him for. I have done nothing, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Melintus,</hi> but what I was oblig'd to: but yet I will not diſ-eſteeme what
it pleaſes you to make me offer of; and I aske you no other favour, but that
you will never wiſh mee any ill, whatever heart-burning you have had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my father. I confeſſe to you, anſwer'd <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> ſomewhat aſham'd,
that we have heretofore had ſome difference, <hi>Telephus</hi> and I, by reaſon wee
were both of a contrary faction: but for the preſent, things are well chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
and I am ſo farre from having a deſire to wiſh you any ill, as I promiſe
to employ that you have preſerv'd to me in your ſervice, to the uttermoſt of
my power. I beſeech you, replide <hi>Melintus,</hi> to take an oath of this in the
hands of <hi>Palamede.</hi> That will I ſurely, anſwers <hi>Dicearchus;</hi> and having call'd
him, <hi>Melintus</hi> ſayes to him; <hi>Dicearchus</hi> will doe me the grace to promiſe me,
that he ſhall never beare any ill will to me, what-ever hee has had to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I wonder, replies <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> you will make any doubt of this, after
the extreme obligation I have to you: but ſince you are ſo deſirous, I take
an oath hereof betweene my Nephew's hands, and pray the gods to puniſh
me, if I ever faile of that I ſweare to. <hi>Palamede</hi> added, <hi>Melintus</hi> may be well
aſſured of that you promiſe him; for 'tis impoſſible you ſhould ever wiſh
me any good without loving him too, ſeeing I will never have any good
without him; and he has too much merit to be refus'd good will. After theſe
common aſſurances of friendſhip, <hi>Dicearchus</hi> led them into his Neeces cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
where entring in firſt upon the ſudden, he was ſtrangely affected to find
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7768:69"/>
a young man upon her bed that embrac'd her, and ſeeing him, preſently
came downe off her bed, and goe his way towards the bed <hi>Erycine</hi> was in.
<hi>Dicearchus</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ariana;</hi> Ha! what's this, my neece, is't poſſible this that I
have ſeene? <hi>Ariana</hi> ſmiled, but yet aſham'd, as this young youth was alſo.
<hi>Dicearchus</hi> wondring why they ſhould laugh ſo, replide, What's the matter,
Neece? Where is become of this honour, and this vertue? What, uncle,
ſaid ſhe to take away his errour, you know not <hi>Epicharis</hi> then; (for it was
ſhe ſtill diſguis'd that embrac'd her deare Miſtreſſe, who could not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the kindneſſes ſhe expreſs'd to her, for the agreeable ſervices ſhee
had done her;) And now <hi>Dicearchus</hi> regarding her, was himſelfe aſham'd
that he had accus'd them, and ſaid that another would have beene deceiv'd
as well as he. After rejoycing to ſee her againe, and learning ſome of their
fortunes, he enquir'd of <hi>Ariana</hi> how ſhe did with her wearineſſe, and after
the fright ſhe had beene in; ſhee aſſur'd him that her brothers returne had
cur'd all her diſtempers. Well, ſayes he, I will leave you with this good bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of yours, and <hi>Melintus</hi> with <hi>Erycine</hi> (that was in a bed on the other ſide)
for 'tis no ſmall matter you have to tell one another, and the ſame time went
his way out. <hi>Palamede</hi> told his ſiſter, Wee have had leiſure enough of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
together by the way as we came, and for my part I finde theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments
of ſiſters but cold ceremonies: It were better we ſeparated,
and ſo went away from her to caſt himſelfe upon <hi>Erycine's</hi> bed, leaving <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
with his ſiſter. <hi>Ariana</hi> to be even with him, ſayd, Brother, I admire
your humour to be ſo ſoone comforted for what you have heard: that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
all on the ſudden abated his courage, and ſtayed the liberties he
began to take with <hi>Erycine</hi> and <hi>Epicharis,</hi> who had much adoe to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from him. <hi>Melintus</hi> taking that occaſion, ſaid to <hi>Ariana;</hi> Madam, I
underſtood this loſſe with a great deale of ſorrow, you being ſo ſenſible of it
your ſelfe. I ought not, ſayes ſhe, to have bin exempt from miſeries, while you
and my brother were ſo cruelly perſecuted by fortune: but I ſweare to you,
I was ſufficiently tormented with the feares I had for you two, though this
accident had not befallen me. I doe not thinke my eyes were ever dry ſince
I left you; you ſee a face that ſufficiently ſhewes the part it hath taken in
the vexations of my ſoule: and doe but conſider a little to what I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
when by your hands I was deliver'd, and what thoughts I could
have being in the hands of thoſe robbers. After loſing of a brother as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev'd,
whoſe death was followed with my fathers, I ſaw they were gone to
cut my uncle's throat, the onely ſupport I had left me, and my ſelfe forſaken
of all, and condemn'd to ſuffer the rage of thoſe hangmen, without your
reſcue, whom I am beholding to for, what I have moſt deare in the world.
Madam, anſwered <hi>Melintus,</hi> we were firſt indebted to you for our life and
honour, and you ſecured both to us by meanes of <hi>Epicharis</hi> whom you ſent
us; if ſince we have aſſiſted you, you are wholly to thanke your ſelfe for
your deliverance: but I know not how you ſhould ever pardon mee for
the feares I put you in, going to force you away from among thoſe Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
But rather, replide ſhe, how will you pardon mee the blowes I gave
you, for ſo I payed you for all the paines you had taken to ſave me. Ah, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
anſwer'd he, how pleaſing were thoſe blowes to me, but may I dare
to remember you of one you call'd upon to helpe you? <hi>Ariana</hi> bluſh'd, and

told him a little after, I remember it well enough, and give you leave to
take thoſe words I ſpake, as much for your advantage as you pleaſe. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
taking her hand in exceſſe of joy, purſues: Upon this aſſurance, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
may I from henceforth without offence tell you my thoughts? Hee
ſpake theſe words in a voyce ſo trembling, and with a face ſo pale, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi>
well perceiv'd the extreme reſpect he bare her, and the feare he had to
tell her of any thing might diſpleaſe her: but to encourage him, ſhe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
<hi>Melintus,</hi> I have ſufficiently made triall of your friendſhip by your
diſcretion; I will not have you ſpend ſo much as one word to aſſure me any
more of it. He was ſo raviſh'd, that bowing him, and putting his mouth
to the faire hand he held, hee was ſome time in this poſture, without any
ſpeaking, ſo tranſported was he with contentment. <hi>Ariana</hi> was very glad
to ſee him ſo ſeized: but at laſt he lift up himſelfe, and ſaid to her; What
will you thinke of me, Madam, to ſee me ſilent after ſuch a favour? and
indeed ſo great it is, that there are not words to expreſſe to you, neither
the exceſſe of my joy, nor how much I am to reſt your ſervant. <hi>Ariana</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
him, If we meaſure the obligations, without doubt thoſe I have to
you are farre the greater: but you are to be ſatisfied with mee, ſeeing that
to acquit myſelfe I give you my ſoule, which is all I am. Your ſoule, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
replies <hi>Melintus,</hi> may I be ſo bold to beleeve theſe advantageous
words? but why ſhould I not beleeve them, ſince they come from your
mouth that cannot be but true? Will this faire ſoule then give it ſelfe to me,
for to animate a body ſo unworthy of it? and will you indeed receive mine
in place of it? <hi>Melintus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ariana,</hi> I doe not meane ſo, this exchange
would be too prejudicious for you: but at the leaſt I give you a part of my
ſoule, which is my will, and I muſt have you diſpoſe of it from henceforth, in
exchange of yours, which I am ſure is in my poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> was ſo rapt for theſe deare engagements, that the commotions of
his heart diſturb'd his minde, and ſtopp'd the freedome of his thoughts; and
the knowledge of that diſorder gave <hi>Ariana</hi> a greater aſſurance of his joy
and paſſion, than a thouſand words could have done. In the end he replies,
It is impoſſible, Madam, I ſhould expreſſe to you how deare theſe favours
are to my ſoule: for the more I reſent them, the leſſe am I able to tell you:
but it ſuffices you to know the greatneſſe of my affection, by being aſſured
how they repleniſh me with joy, and you ſhall ſee with what ſubmiſſion I
receive them, by the inviolable reſpect that ſhall alwayes accompany me in
your preſence; and when I have declar'd what I am, I will inceſſantly call
to my remembrance the eſtate wherein I was when you were ſo favourable
to me. <hi>Melintus,</hi> ſayes <hi>Ariana</hi> interrupting him, this declaration is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
you are to thinke upon at this time: and I would adviſe you to
make your ſelfe knowne to my brother: you are not to deferre it any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
if you thinke it fit to be done: and then we may conſult together con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the wayes we are to take, for ſince the death of my father, there
is come from <hi>Corinth, Piſistratus,</hi> ſonne of <hi>Calistenes,</hi> who was uncle to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidalia,</hi>
by whoſe onely meanes my uncle married her, after a ſute of many
yeeres laſting. This <hi>Piſistratus</hi> drawne hither rather by the reputation of
ſome eſtate, than of any beauty he ſayes is in me, hath brought letters from
his father to <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> wherein he deſires him to doe the like in his ſonnes
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7768:70"/>
behalfe with me, that he had heretofore done for him with his Neece <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidalia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Piſistratus</hi> relying upon that favor, thinks not he hath made an unprofitable
voyage; but that with the duties he renders my uncle, and the affection he
expreſſes to me, he ſhall preſently marry me, and carry me away to <hi>Corinth</hi>
in the ſame ſhip that brought him hither, which ſtill attends him for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
On the other ſide, <hi>Diocles</hi> ſeekes my uncle more than ever, and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines
them both with hope, not knowing what to reſolve on: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he hath great obligations to <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> he is not willing for all that
to have me ſo farre from him, by giving me to <hi>Piſistratus:</hi> and againe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to have ſuch faire poſſeſſions, and comming of a farre more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
houſe than <hi>Amyntas,</hi> he cannot finde in his heart to refuſe him. Upon
theſe uncertainties, it were good you firſt declar'd your birth, and after that,
your ſuit. Madam, replied <hi>Melintus,</hi> you doe me a very great favour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
me of all theſe things; and I am very glad your counſell is correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the deſigne I had; but yet I would have wiſhed that it had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the permiſſion I had deſired of you to make this declaration. I hope,
it will be well receiv'd; for the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> have cauſe to love me, and <hi>Dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus</hi>
is oblig'd to me by oath never to wiſh me ill for my fathers ſake. The
life, ſayes <hi>Ariana,</hi> you ſaved him, ought much more to oblige him to that,
and I have reaſon to take this ill, becauſe all that wee ſhall reſolve on from
henceforth to your benefit, will rather be thought duty and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than affection. I ſhall ever take it for pure grace, replies <hi>Melintus;</hi> for
ſcarcely could all my ſervices together pretend to hope for ſo much as one of
thoſe words you favour me with.</p>
               <p>This agreeable converſation ended at the arrive of <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> that came
to take <hi>Melintus,</hi> and to ſhew him, with his Nephew, the beauties of his
houſe, before the night obſcur'd them: and it was rare indeed for the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of it; but yet more recommendable for the antiquity: for they tooke it
to be the very ſame houſe that the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> made preſent of to <hi>Timoleon,</hi>
to ſtay him amongſt them with his wife and children, which he had brought
from <hi>Corinth;</hi> and which he receiv'd at their hands for to enjoy, himſelf,
the reſt of his dayes the peace and liberty that he had purchaſed to all <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>
and for markes of this antiquity had <hi>Dicearchus</hi> left in a place out of
the way, ſome ruines which he brought <hi>Melintus</hi> to ſee, where there were
beſides entire columnes of that ſame faire <hi>Corynthian</hi> worke: but ſome yeares
agoe he had himſelfe made that houſe the faireſt that was in all <hi>Sicily:</hi> for
beſide the richeſſe of the buildings, the beautifulneſſe of the gardens and
walkes was ſo delightfull, for the quantity of fountaines and channels, that
<hi>Melintus</hi> never left admiring that delicate place, and failed not to obſerve
what-ever was moſt eſteemeable to pleaſe <hi>Dicearchus:</hi> yet he could not but
admire above all things the rarities of a great Parke, where, reſerving only
that the allies were made by Art, nature appeared in her pure richeſſe. The
fountaines that ſprang out in many places, the little rivolets that came of
them, and the faire meadowes they watered, flatter'd <hi>Melintus's</hi> humour in
ſuch ſort, that <hi>Dicearchus</hi> perceiv'd well enough, how in that place he had
given over compleaſance, to make a true eſtimate of what he liked beſt. <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
having advertis'd him to leave <hi>Melintus</hi> there, for that he loved nothing
<pb facs="tcp:7768:70"/>
ſo much, as to loſe himſelfe in ſo delightfull ſolitudes, by little and little
they went away from him, as if they had had ſomething to ſay together;
and <hi>Melintus</hi> making as though he favour'd their entertainment, out of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
withdrew himſelfe from them with much joy, for to converſe with
his thoughts in that happy condition he was in.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as he had loſt ſight of them, he choſe a fit place to repoſe in, and
laid him downe upon the graſſe neare a Fountaine that pleaſed him, and there
his minde repreſented his fortune to him in the higheſt and ſweeteſt point a
Lover could poſſibly have deſir'd it. His heart wanted place to containe all
the joyes that aſſembled there. <hi>Ariana's</hi> gracious words too, came to ſtrike
his eares with ſo melodious a ſweetneſſe, that there is no harmony able to
cauſe ſo much raviſhment. This charme reduc'd his paſſion to that content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
brought his hopes to that height, and placed his ſoule in a heaven of
ſuch divine pleaſures, that he was even ready to expire in this pleaſing exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.
In the end, retiring him out of this abyſſe of joyes, to conſider his
good fortunes particularly, he forgat not one of them, that he might be the
more ſenſible how many ſorts of happineſſe accompanied him; and after he
had a long time entertain'd ſo deare imaginations, he employed the time that
remain'd in making theſe verſes:</p>

                  <l>You agreeable fore-runners</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> having finiſh'd thoſe verſes, quitted the place hee was in, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to them he had left, whom he found in a great plaine Court, waiting
to carry him to ſupper. <hi>Ariana</hi> and <hi>Erycine</hi> roſe to keepe them company, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but ſimply dreſt, and yet this negligence of their dreſſing was to their
advantage. The more cauſe <hi>Melintus</hi> had to approach to <hi>Ariana,</hi> to enjoy
the perfect union they had made, the leſſe dared he; ſcarce giving his eyes
leave to looke often upon her: nevertheleſſe he knew well enough how to
governe his diſcretion, not to make his conſtraint appeare, nor too much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
diſſimulation. The whole courſe of their adventures furniſh'd them
with entertainment enough during ſupper-time, and after they were roſe
from Table; <hi>Dicearchus</hi> who began to admire the wit of <hi>Melintus,</hi> and
could never heare him ſpeake enough, tooke him from the company to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
him; and willing to know if hee were as well capable to manage
publike affaires, as to treat of any other diſcourſe he appear'd ſo able in, he
turn'd warily all he had to ſay upon that ſubject: but <hi>Melintus</hi> ſeemed to be
practis'd all his life long in no other thing, and not onely ſatisfied <hi>Dicear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
in what he demanded of him, but upon every propoſition too, added ſo
rare conſiderations as he had never heard the like, that he was forc'd to avow,
that ſo able a Genius deſerv'd more than a publike government, and ſeem'd
to be borne to ſuſtaine a Crowne and Scepter. In the end they all parted to
goe to bed; and the Ladies being retired, <hi>Melintus</hi> was brought to a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb facs="tcp:7768:71"/>
richly furniſhed. He ask'd <hi>Dicearchus</hi> if it were that <hi>Palamede</hi> ordinarily
lay in, becauſe they had ſworne never to lye from one another, when they
ſhould be in the ſame place. After ſome Civilities, <hi>Dicearchus</hi> left them to
their liberty: then being together, and in bed; when they were alone, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
continued a while without ſpeaking any thing, and a little after came
to embrace <hi>Palamede,</hi> and told him: It is time, deare friend, you ſhould
know the ſecret of my life, which you have hitherto beene ignorant of. Is't
poſſible, ſayes <hi>Palamede,</hi> that you have conceal'd any thing from me? You
will confeſſe, replide <hi>Melintus,</hi> that I was bound to conceale it from you, and
will not be offended thereat, when you ſhall know that the exceſſe of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
you beare me, oblig'd me to it. My deare <hi>Melintus,</hi> anſwers <hi>Palamede,</hi>
haſte you then to tell it me, and aſſure your ſelfe, that when I ſhall be able to
doe you ſervice, I will not thinke upon reproaching you. Then <hi>Melintus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
to him all the manner of his birth; to which <hi>Palamede</hi> harkened with
ſo much contentment, that he would not ſo well have reſented the like good
fortune, had it hapned to himſelfe. He ceas'd not admiring at a fortune ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
and doubted not, but that <hi>Diocles</hi> would bee convinced by thoſe
meanes they were prepar'd of: that if there were, at laſt, need of violence,
he was not a man to make reſiſtance againſt them. This is it, replide <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
that kept me from diſcovering me untill now to you, for the friendſhip
you have to me would have prevail'd with you to make this appearance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it may be, there were cauſe for it; and now is the fitteſt time by farre,
you will confeſſe. <hi>Melintus</hi> went through with all that diſcourſe aſſuredly
enough: but when he was purpos'd to diſcover to him the affection he had
for his ſiſter, he ſcarce dar'd to pronounce the faire name of <hi>Ariana. Palamede,</hi>
after ſome words, knowing from whence that difficulty of ſpeech proceeded,
would encourage him, and ſaid; My deare <hi>Melintus,</hi> it is not neceſſary you
tell me that I know as well as you; and you have heard from my ſelfe, how
greatly I deſire that happineſſe, as well for my own contentment, as yours:
if I could binde me to you by an alliance yet more ſtreight, I would ſeeke it,
ſo fearefull am I that we are not yet ſufficiently united: give leave therfore
that from this very houre the name of brother be common to us: we are
already brothers in wils, and I hope we ſhall be ſo in effect very ſhortly. I
make no doubt but my ſiſter acknowledges your deſervings, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
them, loves you, beſides the obligations ſhe hath to you; and for
my uncle, he but now made me a diſcourſe, when wee left you there in the
Parke, that ſhewed plainly how his deſigne might eaſily correſpond with
ours. Oblige me, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> and tell me what he thinks of me: You would
not beleeve, replies <hi>Palamede,</hi> how much the aſſiſtance he receiv'd of you this
day has wrought upon him, and he deſires nothing more, than to render you
one day, if it be poſſible, as great a pleaſure. The occaſion, ſayes <hi>Melintus,</hi>
interrupting him, offers it ſelf: for he may in like manner oblige mee for
my life. He is not farre off this, anſwered <hi>Palamede,</hi> becauſe having no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
intention than this, which is to maintaine the authority he hath in <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,</hi>
he told me, that although <hi>Telephus</hi> had not beene his friend, he ſaw none
ſo fit as you, whereupon to ſtay the credit and eſteeme we might keep there:
for the peoples love was already ſet upon you, and that we had a faire meanes
to binde us for ever to you, by a perſon whom it ſeemes you have fairely
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7768:72"/>
wonne, going to take her out of thoſe Souldiers hands; and that he beleev'd
too ſhe would not make reſiſtance to this, becauſe certaine words eſcap'd her,
when ſhe knew you, that gave him cauſe to thinke ſhe hated you not, and
that you were alſo in love with her. That hee was very glad hee was no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
engaged with <hi>Diocles,</hi> nor with <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who is come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
drawne by my ſiſters reputation; and for that he found himſelfe ſtill at
liberty to deliberate upon our good fortune and yours, which he would ſeeke
as much as in him lay, in ſatisfaction of what he owes you.</p>
               <p>There wanted but little to have this diſcourſe as pleaſing to <hi>Melintus,</hi> as
the entertainment he had with <hi>Ariana</hi> her ſelfe: in the end hee knew, how
there remained no other doubt in <hi>Dicearchus</hi> minde, but the difficulty of his
eſtate, which was not ſo great as <hi>Ariana's:</hi> but <hi>Palamede</hi> added, that the
newes he was to bring him, would ſoone cleare every thing that might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their common contentment. <hi>Melintus</hi> eſteem'd himſelfe very happy in
the opinion <hi>Dicearchus</hi> had conceiv'd of him; and after they had paſſed a
great part of the night in ſo deare diſcourſing as this, they fell both aſleep, and
waked not untill it was ſomething at the lateſt.</p>
               <p>But whereas they ſpent the beginning of the night in their entertainment,
<hi>Ariana,</hi> and <hi>Erycine</hi> that lay together, gave the end of it to theirs: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſpeake as ſoone as they waked, which was afore day; and when that
appear'd, <hi>Erycine</hi> perceiv'd <hi>Ariana</hi> had put the ſheet from off her becauſe of
the heat, and ſaw hereby ſo many wonders, that ſhe could not containe her
ſelfe from ſaying; Who ſhall that happy man be, that ſhall one day enjoy all
thoſe beauties? <hi>Ariana</hi> ſmiling, anſwered her, It may be a perſon you have
ſome intereſt in. <hi>Erycine</hi> bluſhed, thinking ſhe meant it by <hi>Amyntas,</hi> whom
ſhe was in love with, and who loved her too; and becauſe ſhe would ſeeme
crafty, told her; I have no intereſt in thoſe that have none in me. <hi>Ariana</hi>
knowing her miſtake, replied; And of whom, thinke you, doe I meane to
ſpeake? Of <hi>Amyntas,</hi> replied ſhe, becauſe you have heard ſay that hee loved
mee. Aſſure thy ſelfe, deare <hi>Erycine,</hi> ſayes <hi>Ariana,</hi> that I am very farre from
thinking of him: he is a man I never ſpake to, and whom I will not know
whileſt I live. And yet, anſwered <hi>Erycine,</hi> but a while ſince, 'twas thought
your marriage was reſolv'd on. Never, replide <hi>Ariana,</hi> came it to that point
yet; for I take not my reſolutions on that faſhion, and though I ſhould have
conſented to it, the returne of my brother and yours gives me other thoughts
for the preſent. But, went ſhe on, how could <hi>Amyntas</hi> endure the ſearch of
me, after he had loved you? Whence came that coldneſſe? Was it on your
part, or on his? On neither, anſwered <hi>Erycine,</hi> and if you will aſſure mee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to marry <hi>Amyntas,</hi> I ſhall not faile to tell you all that paſſed betweene us.
I may well ſweare that to you, replide <hi>Ariana,</hi> and if you have any deſigne one
to the other, be certaine that I will not bee the cauſe of our being all three
unfortunate: but you ſhall doe me a great pleaſure, to learne me ſomething
of your life; and I pray therein ſpend the time that is left us, before wee are
to riſe. This aſſurance, ſaid <hi>Erycine,</hi> and your friendſhip, obliges mee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
nothing from you: then ſhe began her ſtory thus.</p>

                  <p>THe affections that are bred with us, and which we have as it were ſucked
in with our milke, are turn'd into ſo powerfull habits, and take ſo deepe
rooting, that they are not to be plucked up but with violences that are as ſo
many deadly blowes; and I rather beleeve the impoſſibilitie of ridding ones
ſelfe of them; becauſe the paſſion that findes it ſelfe growne before the birth
of reaſon, knowes its owne ſtrength, when reaſon begins but to appeare, and
ſo alwayes maſters it not onely as the firſt borne, but as ſuperiour. I confeſſe
to you this is the reaſon why I have ſuffered ſo many troubles with a pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
conſtancy, in ſpight of the croſſes which <hi>Amyntas</hi> and my affection have
met with, and to tell you their beginning, I muſt of neceſſity tell you the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of my life too.</p>
                  <p>Since the birth of my brother <hi>Melintus, Hyperia</hi> my mother had beene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times great with childe, but ſhe could never be deliver'd of any alive;
untill at laſt having made ſome vowes to <hi>Lucina,</hi> ſhee was brought to bed of
me. This was a very great joy to the houſe; and <hi>Diocles,</hi> the chiefe friend
my father <hi>Telephus</hi> had, came to congratulate with him, and brought his ſonne
<hi>Amyntas</hi> too, that was then but five or ſix yeares old: they told him jeſtingly,
I ſhould be his Miſtreſſe, whereto he agreed, and ask'd to kiſſe me. I beleeve
that he could then make me no very eloquent offer of ſervice; neither did I
give him any great cauſe to love me, being but a diſagreeable Miſtreſſe, and
very troubleſome, that had nothing but cryes to entertaine him. His father
inſtructed him in the duties he was to render me, and ſometimes laughed
with <hi>Telephus</hi> at the faſhion he tooke them in hand; every morning hee ſent
firſt to heare from me, and after came himſelfe to ſeeme, and kiſt my hand:
one while he brought me a poſie, another time a coloured feather, that they
pinn'd on my head, in hope that one day I would give him ſome of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to weare in that faſhion. When I began to ſpeake, hee expreſt much
contentment, having no more a mute to entertaine; and ſeeing how that
which he loved began to be inform'd with a ſoule, he ſeem'd to augment his
affection at it: In like manner finding him compleaſant in every thing I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd,
I had a friendſhip to him; for children are pleas'd with thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
them not. We had a thouſand ſorts of playes, where I was the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
and he the ſervant: I commanded him with gentleneſſe, hee obeyed
me with joy, and ſo the tendereſt of our yeeres paſſed away in many inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
recreations. I cannot repeat to you all our childiſh diſcourſes; but when
he came to be ſeventeene or eighteene yeere old, that age, that is accuſtom'd
to change all things, had not this power over him: for in ſtead of diminiſhing
by degrees this affection that had taken no foundation, uſe ſerv'd him for
matter of love, and made him purſue his deſigne of loving me. For my part,
comming to a little more underſtanding, I perceived how theſe little liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were not very honeſt, and would retire me from him. He was not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
troubled at this, for he is of an humour, not to afflict himſelfe; and to
be moved at nothing, as you ſhall ſee by that which followes, and onely ſaid
one day to me; It ſeemes, my faire Miſtreſſe, you love your ſervant no
more. I had at that time judgement enough to anſwer him: I pray you leave
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7768:73"/>
theſe names that are no more fit for me, than for you. He, without accuſing
me of change, or going to complaints, told me; 'Tis now impoſſible wee
ſhould loſe theſe qualities, ſince I have neither will nor power to doe it. If
it be not poſſible to you, ſaid I to him, it is very poſſible to me; and from
this time I will quit the name of your Miſtreſſe. That, anſwered he, depends
not on you. On whom then, replide I? On me, purſued he; for I remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
alwayes your ſervant, you muſt of neceſſity continue my Miſtreſſe.
What, though I forbid you, replied I. You pretend then, anſwered he, ſome
power over me, and in that reſpect your ſelfe agrees to be my Miſtreſſe. You
may interpret, ſaid I, my words as you pleaſe; but I will not have you uſe
me any more in this faſhion. Since you permit me, anſwered hee, to give
what ſenſe I would to your words: I will have them ſignifie that you love
me, but that you are not deſirous at all to make it appeare. Looke you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plide
I, I lov'd you, being a childe; but things are chang'd. I doe not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
at this change, anſwered he, for in that firſt age you ſaid before all
the world that you lov'd me, and it was nothing ſo; and now you will love
me indeed, and ſay nothing. Flatter your ſelfe as much as you pleaſe, ſaid I,
but for me I know well what I am reſolv'd on: ſo I left him, and went to
joyne me with the other Maids, to avoyd his returnes, for my young age
furniſh'd me not with reaſons ſtrong enough to vanquiſh him; and my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
emboldned him the more.</p>
                  <p>Some time after <hi>Diocles,</hi> who had by little and little enrich'd himſelfe
without noyſe, was declar'd poſſeſſor of the great eſtate hee had acquired;
and <hi>Amyntas</hi> thinking nothing could be refus'd him with the advantages he
had, ſeemed more than ever, aſſured of my affection. I beleev'd, my honour
oblig'd me to expreſſe more coldneſſe to him ſtill, for feare it might bee
thought that I made much of him for his riches; in ſuch a faſhion, that I
altogether withdrew me from him, and would not ſuffer him to ſpeake to
me in particular. I thinke he perceiv'd my cunning well enough, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being amazed at my reſolution, he would needs write to mee. One day
he came to ſee me, when I was in company, I know not what ſhift he made
to put a Letter into my pocket, and when hee was gone his way. I put my
hand by chance into it, and was ſtrangely taken, finding this writing that was
not to have beene there. Nevertheleſſe I diſſembled what had befallen me,
and having impatience till I were alone to ſee what it was, went out, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a letter I open'd it, and ſaw that it was thus:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>Amyntas to Erycine.</head>
                        <p>IF I found my ſelfe faulty, I ſhould not be ſo bold to demand of you a reaſon for
your ſeverities; but having alwayes ſerv'd you with fidelity, I dare be bold to
ſay that it's impoſsible you ſhould wiſh me ill, what-ever diſguiſe you put on. It
may be you would make triall of me: but if you have a deſigne to receive my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
after a great deale of time and paines, I pray you doe it for the preſent, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us both of the cares and vexations you are preparing us. I aſpire not to that
ſad glory of knowing how to ſuffer well; and when I ſhall have endur'd your cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elleſt
torments, you would in the end be obliged to relent. Doe that now for affection,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7768:73"/>
which you would then doe for juſtice, and making me ſo happy, you ſhall force mee to
ſerve you alſo for juſtice, which I did not before, but for affection.</p>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
                  <p>I blamed him a little to my ſelfe, for taking the boldneſſe to write to me,
and for the liberties he us'd in his letter: but yet this humour of turning thus
all things to his advantage, was not diſagreeable to me: ſometimes I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
my owne facility that was the cauſe he could not thinke me ſo ill, as I
ſeemed: on the other ſide I was very glad that hee gave not backe for thoſe
feined rigours, becauſe I did but what I ought to doe, and that made him
never the farther from loving me. At that time I gained alſo the affection
of <hi>Miſander,</hi> if I may ſo call the deſire he expreſt to ſee and ſpeake with me:
fot doubtleſſe you will laugh at the humour of that man. I have heard ſay,
interrupted <hi>Ariana,</hi> that he is of <hi>Reggium,</hi> and comes often to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> but
that he is very melancholicke. It is impoſſible, replide <hi>Erycine,</hi> you ſhould
imagine to what degree he is ſo. He came one day to ſee me in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Amyntas</hi> that was his friend, at that time <hi>Hyperia</hi> my mother was very
ſicke, and in danger to dye: my affliction which he found to have ſome ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
with his ſad humour, cauſed, as I beleeve, the good will he had to me.
His diſcourſes were to make me ſee, that I had cauſe rather to bee afflicted
than comforted, his wit affording him no reaſons for to vanquiſh my griefes:
and after he had employed ſome words to expreſſe the part he tooke in my
ſorrow, he thought he had ſufficiently declar'd his affection to me; ſince it
may be I was the firſt he had obliged by that compleaſance. Thinking ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had got familiarity enough with me by this firſt encounter, he came
to reviſit me, when my mother was in better health, and I rejoyced at her
recovery: my jollity truly made not his affection dye, which my ſadneſſe
had produc'd; but ſtanding mute to all the diſcourſes wherein I expreſs'd a
ſatisfaction in him, he would peradventure have had mee beleev'd that his
ſilence proceeded from love; and ſome dayes after, ſeeing me to receive
him with a great deale of kindneſſe, as I am accuſtomed to uſe all that come
to ſee me, he tooke the liberty to complaine of me, and would have mee
thinke that I dealt unjuſtly with him not to acknowledge the affection hee
bare me, although he had made none at all appeare to me, whether by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
or any other way. For my part having no cauſe to ſatisfie him, it was
no difficult matter to me to keepe him in that plaintive humour; and every
time he ſaw me, he ſeem'd to have obtain'd what he deſired; for when I
us'd him with harſhneſſe, or contempt, he ſet himſelfe to diſcourſe, that he
was the moſt miſerable of men; that thoſe women that had a ſweetneſſe
for all other, had nothing for him but diſdaines; that his encountring was
ſo unfortunate, that at the ſame inſtant he appeared, he inſpir'd refuſes, and
rude uſage, into them he deſir'd moſt to be eſteem'd of; that in his very
preſence they affected a favouring of others, to give him the greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure:
To end, upon the ſubject of the miſery of his life, there came a
torrent of words from him which was impoſſible to be ſtopped. I laugh'd
within my ſelfe, that he was ſatisfied after that faſhion, in making all thoſe
complaints and reproaches to me; his ſoule loving to feed on nothing but
ſuch ill nouriſhment as this. You deſcribe a man to me, interrupted <hi>Ariana,</hi>
of a very ſtrange nature, and yet pleaſant enough withall. I cannot, replide
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7768:74"/>
                     <hi>Erycine,</hi> ſufficiently repreſent this miſerable humour: for I have obſerv'd,
that it's impoſſible to pleaſe him, giving a ſenſe to all things that confirmes
his opinion of being miſerable. If I us'd him with any ſort of kindneſſe,
he tooke it for feining; if I treated him with coldneſſe, it was a certaine
contempt: If I ſpake to him, it was, ſaid he, in a certaine faſhion whereby
he perceiv'd well enough the ſmall account I made of him; if I held my
peace, it was to let him ſee that he was troubleſome, and to give him leave
to be gone. In the end I found very true what I had heard my brother ſay
of him, that of all the paſſions, he thought, he had none but the diſpleaſant
and unfortunate ones, as ſadneſſe, feare, jealouſie, deſpaire, diſtruſt, and the
reſt: And upon this ſubject he made an obſervation which I have found
a very pretty one, and am like to retaine it in my memory; that the moſt
things have two faces, which diverſly regarded, make effects as divers:
As in a combat, a man of courage conſiders nothing but the glory of van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing,
and makes ſure of it; a poltron regards nothing but death, which
brings horrour and trouble upon him. Even ſo <hi>Miſander,</hi> being within
corrupted with this ſame blacke humour, regarded but the ill ſenſe of all
things, and interpreted all my actions to his diſadvantage. I had two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
then, very differing; one that complain'd inceſſantly without having
cauſe, the other that alwayes ſatisfied himſelfe what-ever rigour he receiv'd.
I confeſſe to you, <hi>Amyntas</hi> diſpleas'd me not, for the other you may judge
if he were love-able: yet although he were a man I had reaſon to baniſh
my company, the ſoftneſſe of my nature ſuffer'd me not to anger him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to drive him away. <hi>Amyntas</hi> knowing by the intreaty I made <hi>Miſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
that himſelfe was not ungracious with mee, ceaſed not ſeeing me, and
had not failed of greater attempts, but that I made him know his duty;
and my modeſty altogether ſtayed him. <hi>Miſander</hi> had ſo contagious a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
that he was a vexation to all he came neare. <hi>Amyntas</hi> brought me
his acquaintance, but he repented him ſufficiently of it for my ſake, and
more yet for his owne; becauſe <hi>Miſander</hi> never left me, and hee could not
entertain me as he deſir'd. 'Tis true that if I had an enemy, I ſhould wiſh him
to endure the love of a man of this humour: for I beleeve there is nothing in
the world more inſupportable. If you ſtay at home, they will beſiege you cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly,
without ſpeaking ſometimes a word in a day, and will weary out the
moſt reſolute that might thinke to attend their depart, to ſpeake with more
freedome: if you have buſineſſe abroad, they will ſtill accompany you, and
not give you ſo much as one houre of reſpite: and in the meane time, they
will have their ſighes be taken for the ſweeteſt entertainments of love, their
ſilence for an admirable diſcretion, and their importunity for ſervices that
cannot be ſufficiently rewarded.</p>
                  <p>I remember one day <hi>Amyntas</hi> came to our houſe, feining to ſave himſelfe
from the raine he was taken in; as he had ever ſome pleaſant excuſe to come
often thither, and finding <hi>Miſander</hi> there, whoſe preſence importuned him
ſufficiently, without adding to his trouble any thing by this ſorry humour,
he was not able to endure that conſtraint, and went out to be delivered of it,
in ſpight of the raine that ſtill continued: but when hee was abroad, the
ſtorme ſo increas'd, as he was forced to come backe againe to us, where we
paſſed away a day as blacke as can be imagined, as well becauſe of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:7768:74"/>
as for the humour of <hi>Miſander.</hi> On the ſubject of that raine, <hi>Amyntas</hi> the
day after gave me theſe verſes:</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Laſt day, faire <hi>Erycina,</hi> with a ſtorme aſſail'd,</l>
                     <l>At your houſe I beleev'd I ſhould have ſhipwracke fail'd,</l>
                     <l>As at ſome happy Port by heaven granted me:</l>
                     <l>Soone by their radiant beames your eyes me dried,</l>
                     <l>But when ſo neare my heart their flames I ſpied,</l>
                     <l>Muſt I be burn'd, ſaid I, for feare I drown'd ſhould be.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Long time I did endure, becauſe I loved them,</l>
                     <l>But in the end ſurmounted by their heat extreme,</l>
                     <l>I tooke my leave of you to 'ſcape a fire ſo ſore;</l>
                     <l>To the water I return'd to ſeeke a remedy:</l>
                     <l>Although I had deſpite to crave ſo ſuddenly</l>
                     <l>An ayd from that, which would have drowned me before.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Then from a hundred clowds the heaven upon me powres</l>
                     <l>What-ever it contain'd of tempests, or of ſhowres,</l>
                     <l>To raviſh from your eyes the honour of my dying.</l>
                     <l>So came I backe to you, faire Starre of my deſire,</l>
                     <l>For in your ſight I choſe, and in that flame t' expire,</l>
                     <l>Then periſh in the waters never you eſpying.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>In the end <hi>Amyntas</hi> deſirous to be free of the importunities of <hi>Miſander,</hi>
and knowing his humour, adviſed of a tricke as phantaſticall, as he knew his
wit was for the kinde: and we had diſcours'd of him ſometimes, <hi>Amyntas</hi>
and I, and were both perſwaded, that he would be engag'd by contempts,
and put off by favours: he chanc'd to tell me once, that he could not thinke
well of the leaſt liberty a Maid tooke to expreſſe an affection to a man: judge
you, if he perſwaded me to make any appeare to him.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Amyntas</hi> writ a letter in my name, and having ſuperſcrib'd the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it to <hi>Miſander,</hi> he made me beleeve being with us, that he had receiv'd
it from <hi>Reggium</hi> with ſome others, and prayed a wench I had to carry it him
(for he lodged very neare us) without telling where ſhe had it. I knew ſince
that it was thus.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>Erycine to Miſander.</head>
                        <p>Your reſpect hath vanquiſh'd my coldneſſe, and your modeſty hath acquired you
all the eſteeme you could have hoped for of me: but becauſe the reſtraint you
uſe, permits you not liberty enough, I was willing to prevent you with this, and to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you, I ſhall take it very well, that you let me know by yours the quality of your

                  <p>
                     <hi>Amyntas</hi> after he knew of his receiving it, would ſee how his plot tooke;
he went to him, and entring into diſcourſe with a friendlike familiarity, told
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7768:75"/>
him hee came from quitting mee, and that hee beleev'd I would make him
dye for love, and hee ſhould never be able to move mee by his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or by any other duty. <hi>Miſander</hi> anſwered him, You that are of ſo
jolly diſpoſitions, you know not how to ſerve Ladies: Doe you thinke
that all your freedomes are ſo acceptable to them? There muſt bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
and that no common one neither, but of the perfect ſtampe,
ſuch as that I ſerve her with. What, ſaid <hi>Amyntas</hi> laughing, doe you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that your ſadneſſe, and your ſilence pleaſes her? that were to love
the moſt troubleſome thing in the world. Hee would oblige him by this
meanes to let him know his good fortune; and <hi>Miſander</hi> failed not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
for with a ſmile that ſeem'd to mocke at the other, hee anſwered
him; Nevertheleſſe, this ſadneſſe and this ſilence gaine me the favours
which your jollities ought not to pretend to. <hi>Amyntas</hi> to engage him
further, purſues, And what perſwaſion have you ever had that <hi>Erycine</hi>
approves your humour? He anſwered him walking up and downe, and
going with a ſtately pace, By the certaine demonſtrations I have receiv'd
of it. Yoa, replide <hi>Amyntas;</hi> you muſt have dream'd it then this laſt
night, for I have heard her ſpeake of you in a faſhion that was not
very advantageous for you. Hee return'd, Shee conceales by that the
good ſhee wiſhes mee: but read this, ſayes hee, in preſenting him the
Letter, and you ſhall know the truth of the matter, if you know what
belongs to writing. Then <hi>Amyntas</hi> tooke the Table-booke, and after he
had read it, hee feined to enter into a rage to ſee him favour'd to his
prejudice: hee blotted out what was written, and then caſt the Table-booke
into the fire, that I might not receive harme by it, if hee ſhould
have ſhewne it to ſome body elſe, and in the end ſaid a thouſand things
to him againſt me, as tranſported with love and fury. <hi>Miſander</hi> would have
beene angry for that hee had ſo us'd his Letter. What? ſaid <hi>Amyntas,</hi>
can you put an eſtimation upon the favours of that woman that firſt
writes to you, and takes a liberty that is unpardonable for a Maid?
for my part, take her to you, in this humour ſhee is of, ſhe muſt needs
have a great longing to have her letters ſeene, ſince ſhee cannot ſtay
till ſhee receives any, and is not content to write to one alone. I would
but put a tricke upon you, thinking my ſelfe had beene the onely man
ſhee oblig'd by ſuch a favour as this. See, continued hee, taking out of
his pocket a letter of the ſame writing, if I had not cauſe to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in her good graces? but I ſcorne a thing ſhee makes ſo common,
and ſweare never to ſee her while I live, then hee threw the Letter in
the fire, as he had done the other, and before he went away ſo wrought
upon <hi>Miſander</hi> to bring him to what hee deſired, that they proteſted
one to the other never to ſee mee more. I finde, <hi>Ariana</hi> interrupted,
that hee ſomething endangered your reputation, onely to get himſelfe
the liberty of ſeeing you more at his eaſe. 'Tis true, replied <hi>Erycine,</hi>
and when he made mee the relation of this, I was angry with him,
but hee told mee that if <hi>Miſander</hi> ſhould chance to boaſt of that I had
written to him, as little as I were knowne, or he either, never could it
be beleev'd.</p>
                  <p>So loſt I this lovely <hi>Miſander:</hi> but <hi>Amyntas</hi> did not long time enjoy
<pb facs="tcp:7768:75"/>
his artifice, and had no great trouble to hide himſelfe from him for
comming to our houſe, becauſe hee was forced to keepe away by a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
that arriv'd. <hi>Diocles</hi> and my father had ſome conteſtation, in
purſute whereof it was forbidden <hi>Amyntas</hi> to come at us, and me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him. A little after I heard of the ſute <hi>Diocles</hi> made to have you
for him; and one day when he came to mee in the Temple, and would
expreſſe to me the regret hee had for that misfortune of being hindred
ſeeing mee; I told him, Theſe are not the ſpeeches you are to ſtudy for
the faire <hi>Ariana;</hi> you muſt rather make you proviſion for ſome firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
of ſervice. Hee anſwered me, I know very well that <hi>Ariana</hi> is the
deſire of all <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and that you have cauſe to thinke I eſteeme her,
knowing that ſhee is one of the moſt perfect we can ſee: but aſſure your
ſelfe I will never turne my eyes towards her merit, for to faile in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
I have ſworne to you. I ſaid to him, How dare you ſpeake thus to
mee, ſince I know the ſute you are making to her? Say rather, if it pleaſe
you, replied he, that my father makes to her: but albeit he beleeves, I
would not oppoſe my ſelfe to his intention, yet I hope many things will
fall out, before he obtaines that he deſires. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> loves him not, and
will never give his conſent. <hi>Ariana</hi> hath too great a ſpirit, and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
make eſteeme of mee, eſpecially not ſeeking to her by any duties;
and though all things were reſolv'd on, be aſſured that I would get mee
farre enough away for their ever ſeeing mee, untill the faire <hi>Ariana</hi> were
married: She deſerves at the leaſt an intire heart, and mine can never be
but <hi>Erycina's.</hi> I make an oath here before theſe gods we adore, and deſire
them to puniſh me as perjurious, if I ever quit an affection which I have
maintain'd from my birth, and will take a courſe to preſerve it to my
grave.</p>
                  <p>Hee ſpake this to mee with ſo much aſſurance, that I had an opinion
he did not deceive me; and I anſwered him, that nothing but time could
make me judge if he were true or no. Ever ſince he hath continued the ſame
proteſtations to me, and what-ever bruit ran of your marriage, I never
found his paſſion at all abated. Thinke, faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> went <hi>Erycina</hi> on, if I
had not cauſe to eſteeme my ſelfe much indebted to him: for at that time
he ſaw himſelfe ſo rich, the change of his fortune chang'd not his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but ſince, what fidelity would not have given way to the hopes of
poſſeſſing this divine <hi>Ariana?</hi> That word made her bluſh, and oblig'd
her to deſire ſhe would uſe her with leſſe flattery. Permit me, replide <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rycira,</hi>
to ſpeake thus of you; for there is no doubt but that this change had
beene too advantageous for him: Notwithſtanding I was aſſured hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd
me not, becauſe I knew that he came not at you: and you cannot
imagine what torments I endur'd in theſe traverſes: for the occaſions of
loving him ſtill continued, and I ſaw leſſe appearance than ever that our
marriage could be. Conſider for the preſent what contentment I receive,
by the aſſurance you give mee, that you are yet farther off from thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any ſuch matter, than hee is; and by ſeeing you now in a power
to be no more conſtrain'd againſt your minde, ſince you have no more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to rule you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:7768:76"/>
There is no doubt, anſwered <hi>Ariana,</hi> but you are oblig'd to love <hi>Amyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi>
for I can aſſure you, he hath never ſought to give mee the leaſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of affection; and in ſtead of thinking amiſſe of him for making ſo
ſmall account of the ſearch of me, I extremely commend him, for not fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his faith to you. In the faſhion you have deſcrib'd him to me, hee
muſt needs have his heart in a good place; and I hope your affections ſhall
attaine their deſired end: ſo farre am I from hindering it, that I could wiſh
I were happy enough to ſerve you therein, and ſatisfie the obligation I have
to you, for not concealing from me your ſecrets. But, replide <hi>Erycine,</hi> who
can then be that perſon I have intereſt in, that may one day enjoy you?
Deare <hi>Erycine,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ariana,</hi> I give you leave to gheſſe, but you ſhall never
know it from my mouth. Truly, anſwered ſhe, you pay mee well for the
freedome wherewith I have told you the deareſt thoughts of my ſoule.
Then ſhee goes on, My Brother, ſhall he be ſo happy? That may be, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plide
<hi>Ariana,</hi> and yet never ſhall my husband be your brother. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
not your meaning, ſaid <hi>Erycine.</hi> There are many other ſecrets
alſo, replied <hi>Ariana,</hi> that concerne you and <hi>Amyntas</hi> too, as much as my
ſelfe: but upon this ſubject words are forbidden mee, and within a few
dayes nothing ſhallbe hid from you: onely content your ſelfe that I hope to
finde the meanes to make us both happy.</p>
                  <p>As they ended that diſcourſe, <hi>Epicharis</hi> that was up, came to them, and
<hi>Ariana</hi> reaching out her armes to her, made her come nearer, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
her againe, and ſaid to her; My deare Wench, is't poſſible I ſhould
ſee thee againe? and that with thy ſelfe thou ſhouldſt bring mee ſo many
contentments? Can I ever love thee ſufficiently for ſo many ſervices thou
haſt rendered mee? Madam, anſwered <hi>Epicharis,</hi> the ſatisfaction I have
for having done any thing to pleaſe you, has place of a great recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with mee: yet I refuſe not the honour of your love, without
which I confeſſe I could not live. <hi>Erycine</hi> ſaid alſo that ſhee was much
beholding to her, for her brothers ſafety: And becauſe it was now late,
they were ſurpriz'd in this entertainment by <hi>Palamede,</hi> who came into the
Chamber, bringing <hi>Melintus</hi> with him, and opening the Curtaines, called
them ſluggards for being ſtill in bed: <hi>Melintus,</hi> who was more retentive,
ſaid they had endur'd paine enough the day before, for to reſt yet the whole
day. 'Tis not reaſon, ſaid the faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> that you ſhould be walking
up and downe alone by your ſelves to day; and although my uncle has
ſhewne <hi>Melintus</hi> all he thought worthy to be ſeene in his houſe, I am
ſure I ſhall let him ſee beauties which he cannot ſee unleſſe I be there.
Without all doubt, replied <hi>Melintus,</hi> where you are not, many beauties
are wanting. That's not my meaning, ſaid <hi>Ariana:</hi> but there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
places in the houſe, whoſe beauty is unknowne but to my ſelfe;
and I will carry you thither to ſee if you will be of my opinion. If they
pleaſe you, replide <hi>Melintus,</hi> I make no queſtion but they will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to me, and they will be ſo the more, when you are there. Let us
then dreſſe us, ſaid <hi>Erycine,</hi> and goe you downe to ſtay for us in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
where we will preſently come to you. They could not deny them
this leiſure, and ſo the two friends went out of that place ſorrily, where
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7768:76"/>
ſo many beauties were not ſo carefully hid, but that ſome one would
ſtill diſcover it ſelfe, that ſeem'd never to have ſeene day before, ſo
white, and delicate it appeared. They had word brought them, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
men inquir'd to ſpeake with them in the Court of the Caſtle, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
to ſee who it was, they went to them, whileſt theſe faire Ladies
dreſs'd them with all the curioſity they could deviſe.</p>

was knowne that very night in <hi>Syracuſe;</hi> and every one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
that they had all of them eſcap'd the danger; but
when they learn'd how this was done by the ſuccours of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
and <hi>Palamede</hi> that were living, there was a publike joy
ſo great, that never did any people expreſſe the like. <hi>Telephus</hi> and <hi>Hyperia</hi>
could hardly beleeve ſo happy a newes, after they had mourned for <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
as dead, and reſented his loſſe with as many griefes as his deſert, and their
good nature could produce in them. <hi>Telephus</hi> had not fail'd to have come
to him, if he had beene in a friends houſe: but hee was content to ſend
him word to come away ſuddenly to ſee them, and that he would no longer
deny them this contentment. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> chiefeſt friends came from <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi>
to congratulate his good fortune: and the friends of <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
came in great haſte to ſee and embrace them. <hi>Diocles</hi> was not wanting
to ſend to heare from <hi>Dicearchus</hi> and his Neece: but <hi>Piſistratus</hi> came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
himſelfe, being in paine for <hi>Ariana</hi> he was ſo extremely in love with;
and it was he, with ſome others, that having ſeene <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> demanded to
ſalute <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Melintus.</hi> After the embracements of the deareſt friends,
and the ordinary civilities of the reſt, <hi>Melintus</hi> knew that the very Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the City were comming to ſee him. He went as farre as out of the
houſe to meet them, and they perceiving him, alighted from their horſes,
and ſaluted him ſeverally. Then one of the number ſaid to him, that the
great affection he had expreſt to his Country, could not be acknowledged,
but by the like care for every thing that might concerne him, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
for the conſervation of his life, which they were now come to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
for: that death had depriv'd him of a reaſonable faire recompence
he was to receive, as to ſee himſelfe bleſt, the remainder of his dayes, by
all the people: how that heretofore in <hi>Piſa</hi> he had acquir'd a victory glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for him, and for <hi>Syracuſe:</hi> but that the other he obtain'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
that by farre; as being both honourable to himſelfe, and profitable to
his Countrey; that it ſeemed he was not borne but to vanquiſh, and to bee
the ſafety of all, being no ſooner entred into <hi>Sicily,</hi> but that he found new
<pb facs="tcp:7768:77"/>
occaſions of gaining honour to his owne perſon, and preſerving both the
honour and lives of others. He prayed him, in concluſion, to make haſte
to receive the praiſes and good wiſhes of ſo many as were made happy by
his meanes, and aſſured him that if the gods granted but the leaſt part of
the vowes were every day made for him, he ſhould be without doubt the
moſt contented man in the world. <hi>Melintus</hi> anſwered, that hee receiv'd
too much honour for ſo little merit; that the ſervices men doe to their
Countrey, are ſimply duties; that there was not one amongſt them, that
would not have ſought the ſame benefit for <hi>Syracuſe;</hi> and that he was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the happieſt of them, for having met with the occaſion; that if the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſians</hi>
deſir'd to put a greater obligation ſtill upon him, hee demanded,
not out of acknowledgement, but grace, that he might be heard in publike
concerning a cauſe that was of conſequence to him, and that hee ſhould
have wherewithall to make triall of the peoples love, in a matter of juſtice
he was to require at their hands. Not the eares alone, ſaid they, but the
mouthes too, and hearts of the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> are made your owne; and if
they finde the occaſion of rendring you the good-turne they have had
from you, they will reckon that day in the number of the moſt fortunate of
their life. He deſired them to be mindfull of that; and from thence carried
them to <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> who honourably entertain'd them, and was well pleas'd
that they had given <hi>Melintus</hi> that honour, making it his deſigne then to
give him <hi>Ariana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the meane time that <hi>Dicearchus</hi> was buſie with them, and <hi>Palamede</hi>
with <hi>Piſistratus</hi> and the reſt, <hi>Melintus</hi> got him from them all to goe finde
<hi>Ariana,</hi> and not to loſe the time he might paſſe in her company. Hee ſaw
<hi>Erycine</hi> and <hi>Epicharis</hi> that had but now made an end of dreſſing her with ſo
many advantages, as he ſtood in a maze, and ſpake nothing. Shee feined a
neceſſity of thoſe ornaments, being to receive ſo many perſons of quality
as were arriv'd: but the principall cauſe was, to give, if it were poſſible,
more love to <hi>Melintus:</hi> and indeed he was ſo raviſh'd with ſeeing her, that he
almoſt forgat to make the relation of the Deputies he came from entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
He told her at laſt, they ſhould be all oblig'd to returne that very day,
becauſe the people would needs ſee them; that hee could no longer alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the contentment of <hi>Telephus</hi> and <hi>Hyperia,</hi> and beſides that <hi>Dicearchus</hi>
would wait on the Deputies into the City. <hi>Ariana</hi> ſeeing they had ſo little
time to be together, tooke <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Erycine</hi> by the hand; and giving <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picharis</hi>
charge to follow, went with them downe a little winding ſtaires
that led into the Parke without paſſing by the Gardens, and told them, they
were to take that time to walke in at liberty, while they might be thought
to be ſtill a dreſſing. When they were come to the great Allies, <hi>Epicharis</hi>
willing to favour theſe lovers, made as if ſhe would ſhew <hi>Erycine</hi> the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that beſt pleaſed her, and went from them. Hardly can <hi>Melintus</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
be repreſented, at what time he ſaw himſelfe alone neere to his
faire Miſtreſſe: after the meaſure of loſing ſight of them, hee felt himſelfe
advanc'd to ſo high degrees of joy, that hee could not expreſſe them with
his owne eloquence. <hi>Ariana</hi> knowing his ſilence proceeded from exceſſe
of pleaſure, was willing to eaſe him, and ſpake firſt to him: I promis'd to
ſhew you places here you had not ſeene before, and to my liking, the faireſt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7768:78"/>
that belong to the houſe: I will carry you to a place here hard by, that I
have often viſited ſince the wofull newes of yours, and my brothers death:
you will finde, that nature ſeemes to have made it of purpoſe, to entertaine
any thoughts one has a minde to: but as heretofore it hath beene a witneſſe
of my ſorrowes, ſo will I have it now be of my contentments. Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Melintus,</hi> if your ſatisfaction be as perfect as mine, I eſteeme you the
happieſt of the world; but I doubt whether it may be equall to it, being
impoſſible you ſhould have thoſe faire cauſes of raptures that are preſented
to my ſoule. <hi>Melintus,</hi> replide <hi>Ariana,</hi> it becomes me not to expreſſe to
you the exceſſe of my joy, and yet ſhame muſt needs give place to truth,
and I muſt confeſſe, that yours cannot eaſily ſurpaſſe mine: at the leaſt, you
are depriv'd of this pleaſure, which is extreme in me, to ſee you alive, after
I had mourn'd your loſſe: for you cannot be ſenſible of that contentment,
not having beene tormented with the like griefe for me. And I had leſſe
cauſe, anſwered <hi>Melintus,</hi> to hope for the honour of your affection, than you
to ſee me living; and this happineſſe ought to be much more ſenſible to me;
for my life cannot be ſo greatly beneficiall to you, as the expreſſions of your
affection are to me. Ending this diſcourſe, he came to the place whither
<hi>Ariana</hi> conducted him. It was foure delicate ſprings of water that iſſued
forth with noyſe, and ſpred themſelves ſeverally there about thoſe Country
places: in the middeſt of them was a tuft of trees bent together, that made
a moſt delightfull ſhade; underneath thoſe trees ſlept a <hi>Diana</hi> of white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that in her returne from hunting ſeem'd to have choſe the fraiſheur of
this place to repoſe in. <hi>Melintus</hi> vow'd he had never ſeene any thing ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious;
and being entred under thoſe leavy Arbors, <hi>Ariana</hi> ſate her downe
at the feet of the <hi>Diana,</hi> and <hi>Melintus</hi> layd him upon the graſſe at <hi>Ariana's</hi>
feet, not letting goe her hand. A little after ſhe ſaid to him, Will you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that I have brought you into a very pleaſant place? 'Tis farre more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to me, anſwered <hi>Melintus,</hi> than you can imagine; and I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it was never ſo much till now. But Madam, goes he on, kiſſing her
hand, can I ſufficiently prize the happineſſe I poſſeſſe? and may it poſſibly
be one day ſo well confirm'd, as to warrant me from all apprehenſions that
afflict me? <hi>Melintus,</hi> replide ſhe, diminiſh your feares, and receive as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
aſſurances of my friendſhip as my honour will permit: after ſo long a
triall of your affection in ſo many occaſions, and being ſo oblig'd to you as I
am, to uſe diſſimulation and coldneſſe, would no longer be modeſty, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.
Ah Madam, ſayes he, if I may beleeve this I heare, make, I
beſeech you, my happineſſe entire: uſe the meanes that nothing may ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
us. I conjure you to this by my affection that never had equall, by
your beauty for which I have ſo many holy deſires, and by this faire hand I
hold, and conjure too by theſe ardent kiſſes, never to touch other than mine
to give faith to. <hi>Ariana</hi> anſwered, I promiſe that I will never be but <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
his: to this am I oblig'd by his merit, more yet by his affection; and
being redeuable to him both for my honour and life, I remit both of them
into his hands, as things he hath acquired, and whereof hee can better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of than my ſelfe. I ſpeake thus for the preſent now I have no more
father, whoſe abſolute power might contrary my deſires. I dare very well
then make choyce of you, and having made it, aſſure your ſelfe I ſhall as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7768:78"/>
well know how to maintaine it. Madam, replide <hi>Melintus</hi> all confounded,
ſtop I pray you the courſe of theſe obligeant words: my ſoule is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſupport their ſweetneſſe; and the pleaſures that enter in troops at my
eares, are ready to ſtifle it, if my other ſenſes receive not a part of them.
<hi>Ariana</hi> ſeeing that he grew pale in ſcarcely pronouncing thoſe words, bowed
her ſelfe downe thinking he was going to ſowne; and <hi>Melintus</hi> lifting up
his amorous armes to her, ſhe let him lay his head cloſe to hers. It was then
he made proofe, that the deareſt pleaſures of love are not thoſe that are beſt
reſented: for he entred into a fainting that ſtupified all his ſenſes; and when
he came out of that trance, love and reſpect had a long combat within him,
to make him deliberate whether he ſhould attempt any farther, or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with thoſe favours. <hi>Ariana</hi> knowing the doubt hee was in, animated
her face with a redneſſe, and that colour made her yet more Majeſticall: in
ſuch ſort that <hi>Melintus</hi> being up, and having one knee upon the ground,
durſt not conceive a diſhoneſt deſire, ſeeing her ſo full of brightneſſe: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
after he had many times kiſt her hand, he would bring his mouth
even to her boſome, but ſhe putting him ſoftly by with her other hand,
Content your ſelfe, ſaid ſhee, with theſe hands that ſhall ever be favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to you, while you addreſſe your ſelfe to them onely. This <hi>Diana</hi> ſleeps
not ſo faſt but ſhe may be a witneſſe of your actions: and yet I doe not
beleeve you have ſo much as one thought contrary to my deſire, for feare
I ſhould be oblig'd to diminiſh the affection I beare you. Madam, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
he, the living Divinity I behold, gives me a ſufficient reſtraint, and I
here make an oath to this faire hand to ſeeke no other favours but from it;
ſince 'tis from it I expect all my good fortune: but I hope to give it ſo many
kiſſes, as in the end it will be weary of them, and would gladly be eas'd of
thoſe troubleſome kindneſſes, and permit me to give a part of them to the
reſt. <hi>Ariana</hi> taking his head gently with her hands, kiſt him on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and ſaid, you ſhall ſooner receive favours thus, when you ſeeke them
not: then ſhe roſe up, and ſaid it was time to goe finde out <hi>Erycine</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charis</hi>
that would be in paine for them. <hi>Melintus</hi> anſwered her, If they have
had as little thought for us, as I have had for them, I doe not beleeve they
are in any great care for what is become of us. If I were not aſſured, replied
<hi>Ariana,</hi> that they know us well, I had not ſuffered them to have left me ſo:
but let me goe now together with them into my Chamber, and give the reſt
of the day to Ceremonies, after having ſpent the morning in the liberty of
our thoughts. <hi>Melintus</hi> with griefe quitting this pleaſant reſting place,
where he had paſſed ſo agreeable moments, told her, that his life would be
too happy, if he might often meet with ſo ſweet houres. In ſuch diſcourſes
as theſe they tooke the way of the great walke, where they found the two
Maids, whoſe diſcretion was ſuch, as they never enquir'd where they had
ſtayed ſo long; and they all thinking it fit to returne, the Ladies went to
get to the ſame ſtaires, by which they came into the Chamber: and <hi>Melintus</hi>
tooke another way, to take away the opinion of their being together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palamede</hi> was walking in the great Court that was oppoſite to the front
of the houſe, with <hi>Piſistratus,</hi> who had a great deſire to get the good graces
of the brother, ſo to attaine to thoſe of the ſiſter: and ſeeing <hi>Melintus</hi>
come from the Park-ward, he went to meet him, and told him, he was very

glad he had found out places faire enough in that houſe, to invite him more
than once to viſit them, and quit the company of men for their ſakes. 'Tis
true, anſwers <hi>Melintus,</hi> that I would many times leave men, for a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
I now come from. That of your thoughts, ſayes <hi>Piſistratus,</hi> muſt
needs be very agreeable to you. I ſhould wrong my ſelfe, replies <hi>Melintus,</hi>
to abandon men for the entertainment of my thoughts: but one may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
quit them for goddeſſes; and I confeſſe to you that if I durſt have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
my contentment, I ſhould ſtill have beene beſides a <hi>Diana</hi> that is in
this wood. The place, ſaies <hi>Palamede,</hi> is reaſonable pleaſant, and the figure
is one of the faireſt in all <hi>Sicily.</hi> I vow to you, continued <hi>Melintus,</hi> that my
eyes were charmed neare her, and I doe not yet well know how I was able
to retire me from her. The more skill one has in delicate workes, ſayes <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistratus,</hi>
the more one admires them. I deny not, anſwered <hi>Melintus,</hi> that
my admiration proceeds from ſome knowledge: but I am ſure never any
man went from her more ſatisfied than I. I am ſorry, replide <hi>Palamede,</hi> we
are ſo ſoone to goe for <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> ſince you are ſo well pleas'd here: but I
hope we ſhall returne hither often. While they were ſpeaking thus toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Dicearchus</hi> came from meeting with his Neece at the foot of the great
ſtayres, by which ſhe was deſcended with <hi>Erycine</hi> and <hi>Epicharis;</hi> and leading
her into the garden, ſhe appear'd ſo handſome, with a redneſſe that mix'd
it ſelfe with the ſhining of her whiteneſſe, for ſeeing <hi>Melintus</hi> ſhee but now
came from, that ſhe thereby much augmented the paſſion of <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> and
extremely ſatisfied that of <hi>Melintus,</hi> who was in hope to ſee himſelfe very
ſhortly poſſeſſor of ſo many beauties. <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> ſaluted her, and <hi>Melintus</hi> that
had farre more commodious houres to himſelfe, left him the freedome to
enquire of her health, and the feares ſhe was in the day before. He expreſs'd
to her his griefe for having beene ſo unfortunate as not to have come to her
ſuccours, that yeelding to none either in affection or courage, it vex'd him
to yeeld to them in ſo good fortune. <hi>Ariana</hi> receiv'd all thoſe civilities,
and aſſurances of affection, with a coldneſſe pleaſing enough: being not
willing to cauſe to be produc'd in him, either an hope, or the reſentments
of contempt; and preſently ſhe was delivered of this entertainment, for
they were call'd to dinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dicearchus</hi> made his ambition and ſumptuoſity appeare to the height in
gold, whereof the great dining chamber was full; and the magnificence of
the feaſt diſcover'd the pride of his nature, which he veiled under an affected
courteſie. After that dinner was ended, they were to thinke upon returning
to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and to make this entry the more agreeable to the people, it was
order'd that the priſoners ſhould be carried in the front, bound in a Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot;
the Ladies ſhould follow after in a Coach, and the reſt of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
goe in the reare a horſebacke. It was in this equipage they parted from
that houſe, which <hi>Melintus</hi> left with regret, becauſe of the contentment he
had there receiv'd. After he had put <hi>Ariana</hi> into the Coach with his ſiſter,
<hi>Epicharis,</hi> and ſome other Maids, he mounted a horſebacke, and joyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> the Deputies, and the reſt whom hee labour'd to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
by the way; and ſometimes he went to the Coach with <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> and
<hi>Palamede;</hi> ſhewing himſelfe as acceptable among Ladies, as he was ſerious and
able with the moſt ancient of the company that followed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7768:81"/>
                  <hi>Telephus</hi> that had beene advertis'd by <hi>Melintus</hi> ſince the morning, came
out of the City to meet him; and both alighting from their horſes, they
could not quit the embracements they each gave and receiv'd, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with the pleaſure of ſeeing one another againe: yet it became them
to follow the troop; and becauſe <hi>Telephus</hi> had imparted his contentment
to all his friends in the Towne, the people was prepar'd to receive him, and
filled the ſtreets where he was to paſſe: ſo as at their entrance they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh'd
at the world they ſaw. The Deputies had placed <hi>Melintus</hi> in the
middeſt of them; <hi>Dicearchus</hi> went neare to him with <hi>Telephus, Palamede, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtratus,</hi>
and the other of their friends; and hee marched as it were in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and with pleaſure heard the cries of joyes, and the wiſhes the <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſians</hi>
made him, calling him father of his Countrey, and giving him a
thouſand praiſes. <hi>Ariana</hi> beleev'd that ſhe participated of this honour, and
felt a thouſand delights in her minde, to ſee him ſo much belov'd, whom ſhe
loved ſo much her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>In the end this troop ſeparated at <hi>Dicearchus</hi> houſe, where <hi>Ariana</hi> was left
with him, and <hi>Palamede. Telephus</hi> carried <hi>Melintus</hi> home with him, and his
daughter <hi>Erycine;</hi> and the Deputies, with <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> and the reſt, tooke their
leaves to retire every man to his owne houſe. Some Officers of juſtice ſeized
on the priſoners, whoſe condemnation and death followed ſome dayes
after.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Hyperia</hi> had us'd <hi>Melintus</hi> with all the kindneſſes that a true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
might give her owne ſonne, ſhe had thought dead, <hi>Telephus</hi> tooke him
apart, and made him a preſent of two writings; whereof one was an atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
ſigned by <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> wherein he acknowledged, that he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the hands of <hi>Telephus,</hi> a ſonne of his borne at <hi>Lylibeum,</hi> nam'd
<hi>Melintus,</hi> who in the place of his heart was marked with another heart,
for to be of ſome uſe to him, if peradventure hee might one day ſtand in
need thereof. The other was a letter of <hi>Diocles</hi> written to <hi>Telephus,</hi> while
he was ſtill at <hi>Lylibeum,</hi> wherein he rejoyced for the birth of this ſonne of
<hi>Hermocrates,</hi> and ſaid, that this heart which he was marked with, ſignified
that he ſhould love his Countrey, and gaine the heart of all hee deſir'd to
have for his friends. <hi>Telephus</hi> added, how he had happily found theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
whereof he was not willing to ſpeake to him before, thinking they
had beene loſt; but that now with theſe aſſurances, he made no doubt but
<hi>Diocles</hi> would be convinced. <hi>Melintus</hi> rejoyced to have found out theſe
meanes at his arrive, and declar'd to him his reſolution to accuſe <hi>Diocles</hi> in
publike: and that for this cauſe he had demanded an audience of the people
from the Deputies that had beene ſent to him.</p>
               <p>They celebrated yeerely at <hi>Syracuſe</hi> a very ancient feaſt, to thanke the
gods for the ruine of Tyrants, and there was alwayes a man of the race of
<hi>Timoleon,</hi> that was Preſident of the games were made, and a Maid of the
ſame family, to preſent the ſacrifices, and give the prizes of the playes.
This feaſt approach'd, and the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> knowing that <hi>Melintus</hi> deſir'd
ſomething of them, would have him make his demand that very day, and
ſaid, that being delivered not only from the ancient Tyranny, but alſo againe
by his meanes from all Subſidies, they could not receive a more welcome
pleaſure the day of this feaſt, than to recompence <hi>Melintus</hi> in ſome ſort for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7768:82"/>
the benefit he had obtained them. He communicated the matter with <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
and <hi>Palamede,</hi> and told them he feared that having to make an accuſation,
and not a requeſt, leſt <hi>Diocles</hi> might not have cauſe to pretend, that holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
were no dayes for judgements. He propounded to them whether it
might not be more fit, firſt of all to ſpeake with <hi>Diocles;</hi> that peradventure
they might obtaine all of him by faire meanes, in ſhewing the infallible te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
they were provided of. Againſt theſe conſiderations it was alleag'd
that they were to make uſe of the good will of the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> and that they
in the humour they were in, would for love of him paſſe over ordinary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities:
how it was dangerous to ſpeake to <hi>Diocles,</hi> becauſe there was no
appearance he would be diſſeized of his goods any other way than by force;
and that he would rather goe about ſeeking inventions againſt the meanes
were left them; that if he were ſurpriz'd, the trouble of this novelty, and
that of his conſcience, taking from him the way of replying, would make
him be condemned in the field: and that they were not to intreat gently a
man that had us'd malice and treaſon: but <hi>Ariana's</hi> reaſon was beſt approv'd,
that it concern'd <hi>Melintus</hi> (if he would be knowne to be the ſonne of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrates,</hi>
and of the blood of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> and <hi>Achilles)</hi> that this truth ſhould bee
declar'd in publike, and that it was not ſufficient one particular man avowed
it. <hi>Melintus</hi> well perceiv'd, that intereſſing her ſelfe in the honour of his
houſe, ſhe would have her choyce approved of all the world; and confeſt
that in that advice ſhe had expreſt a great deale of underſtanding and ſpirit.
<hi>Palamede</hi> added, that ſince it was ſo reſolv'd, he would intreat his uncle to
ſuffer him to be Preſident of the games; to this end, that being for that
day the Chiefe of all the youth of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> he might have the power in his
owne hands, to make <hi>Diocles</hi> appeare, and to arreſt him, if he would avoyd
the judgement. All being thus concluded on, they expected that day impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently.</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Melintus</hi> ſaw <hi>Ariana</hi> often, and receiv'd of her as
many ſweetneſſes as he could be ſenſible of, being aſſur'd of her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Never did two perſons make ſo great an eſteeme one of another, and
never did two ſoules meet with ſo much ſympathy. They had both of them
a greatneſſe of ſpirit ſo perfect, a wit ſo diſcreet, a quickneſſe in converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo ſparkling, and a modeſty ſo majeſtuous, beſides the beauties where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
nature had ſo liberally endowed them, that never couple encountred
together with ſo much perfection and equality: and ſo admiring one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others
faire qualities, they framed within themſelves ſo relevated an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that every other thing had beene to them but a ſubject of contempt,
had they not yet more deſpis'd to be preſumptuous. <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> too ſaw <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
often, and his love increaſing every day, he ceaſed not to give her new
teſtimonies of it: but ſhe receiv'd them ſo diſcreetly, that he had no cauſe
either to boaſt himſelfe, or complaine; and <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> beleeving that her
vertue and modeſty enjoyned her to uſe him after that faſhion, could not
eſteeme himſelfe ſo farre off, as he was of his hopes. At length the day ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
and <hi>Palamede</hi> having obtain'd of his uncle that he might preſide, made
himſelfe Head of all thoſe that would preſent them at the Playes. <hi>Melintus</hi>
put himſelfe under his Conduct, ſo did <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> who that day had a
deſigne to ſhew that he was worthy of <hi>Ariana: Amyntas</hi> that was one of
<pb facs="tcp:7768:82"/>
the moſt accompliſh'd of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> joyned him to them, with ſome others;
and <hi>Miſander</hi> himſelfe, that had a mind to mingle his melancholious humour
to the publike rejoycing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariana</hi> was led to the Temple in the morning by her brother, and the
Maids of her traine by <hi>Melintus, Piſiſtratus,</hi> and the others. Shee was dreſt
in a white robe, the bodies whereof were cloſe fitted to her waſte, and made
her good ſhape appeare: and in the skirts it was enlarg'd with a thouſand
folds, and training upon the ground made her looke very majeſticall. She
was crown'd with a hat of floures, and her delicate haire in treſſes falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a necke of ſnow, did ſo well ſet forth the beauties of this divine face,
with the whiteneſſe of her necke, whoſe ſplendour dazled mens eyes ſo, that
there was not any one that could ſupport unhurt the ſight of ſo many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
She preſented the ſacrifices upon the altar of Liberty, and made the
ordinary Vowes: but her faire eyes mock'd at the words her mouth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd,
and ſought with their divine beames to raviſh from all that beheld
her, that very liberty which by her vowes ſhe wiſh'd perpetuall to them. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
was ſo rapt with ſeeing her, and thinking that this ceremony ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
be followed with another, that would place him in the very height of
felicities, that theſe deare imaginations ſerv'd him for a pleaſing entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> regarded her too full of admiration, and deſires accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with hopes, and the others conceiv'd wiſhes which they themſelves
confeſt unprofitable, and that were as ſoone ſmother'd by the little hope they
had reaſon for.</p>
               <p>After the Sacrifices were ended, and the ſolemnities that followed them,
ſhee was led up to a Scaffold that was erected in a great meadow out of
the Towne, and all the Ladies came about her, after the ſame manner they
had done at the Temple. The ordinary Judges of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> that were alſo to
judge the prizes, were plac'd lower; among whom was <hi>Diocles,</hi> that never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to be judg'd himſelfe that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> was dreſt in the ſame ſcarfe, and mounted on the ſame horſe
<hi>Ariana</hi> had heretofore preſented to him: but beſides all this, that very
day ſhee had given him a Bracelet of her faire haire, and tyed it to his
arme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palamede</hi> had deſir'd a favour of the gentile <hi>Epicharis,</hi> that from day to day
made him more enamour'd of her, and ſhee not willing to refuſe him that
contentment in ſuch an occaſion, had taken the paines to braid all his haire
for him, with ribbands of ſilke of her colours, for they were all to goe bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed:
The reſt were accommodated as much to their advantage, as it was
poſſible for them. The firſt exerciſe was horſe-races, where the greateſt part
preſented themſelves; and after they had made the Tower of the place with
many a paſſade, they ranged them at the entry of the barriers. At the ſame
time the Trumpets ſounded, it hapned that a Larke purſued by a Hobby,
came to ſave her ſelfe in <hi>Ariana's</hi> hands: thereupon there roſe a cry of all the
people, and <hi>Melintus</hi> turning his head, and conſidering with pleaſure <hi>Ariana's</hi>
actions, delayed the time to ſtart with the reſt: but perceiving his fault, and
ſpurring up his horſe with fury, he ſoone paſſed the laſt; and ſeeing <hi>Miſander</hi>
that was well mounted, and in hope to get firſt the end of the courſe, hee
came juſtling againſt his ſide, and overthrew him and his horſe to the ground.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7768:83"/>
                  <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> that followed him, could not keepe his horſe from falling neither,
when he encountred <hi>Miſanders:</hi> that diſorder ſtayed the courſe of the reſt
that came after, the moſt of them falling alſo, and not able to keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up in the heat they were in; and this number of men and horſes laid
along together, made a ſpectacle ridiculous enough. In the meane time <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
that ſaw none but <hi>Palamede</hi> now as forward as himſelfe, ſlackned the
ſpeed of his horſe, being willing to yeeld this victory to his friend: but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
would needs acknowledge this generouſneſſe of his; for one of <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>
ribbands of his head untying, flew away, and came to encircle <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
his that ran behind him in a little gallop, and girt him after the faſhion of
a Diadem: as if <hi>Palamede</hi> ſeeing how <hi>Melintus</hi> yeelded him the crowne of the
victory, had deſired in recompence to crowne his friendſhip: ſome others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
this action to portend a great Soveraignty that <hi>Melintus</hi> ſhould one
day attaine to Inſtantly there followed great applauſes when this action was
knowne; and <hi>Ariana</hi> her ſelfe in her mind admir'd at <hi>Melintus</hi> his gentile cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
<hi>Palamede</hi> having had the firſt honour, and <hi>Melintus</hi> the ſecond; the reſt
to put off the ſhame they were in, thought of appearing again in ſundry other
games, wherein part of them in one kind, and the reſt in others, acquired ſome
glory. <hi>Melintus</hi> had the prize for having beſt throwne the Javelin, <hi>Amyntas</hi>
that of the bow, and <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> that of the foot-race, ſince the horſe-race had
beene ſo unfortunate to him.</p>
               <p>The faire <hi>Ariana</hi> gave all the prizes that were ordained, and <hi>Melintus</hi> being
the laſt that aſcended the ſcaffold to receive his of her hand, the whole field
reſounded with the noyſe of the people that had an incomparable affection
towards him. <hi>Ariana</hi> as ſhe preſented the prize, ſaid to him in a very low
voyce; Courage, <hi>Melintus,</hi> 'tis time the world know what you are. That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
was accompanied with the peoples at the ſame time: for that <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
turning his head, while he was ſtill upon the ſcaffold, the moſt ancient of
the Judges ſaid to him; Brave <hi>Melintus,</hi> you promis'd the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> to make
this day the demand of that you deſire of them: they intreat you no longer
to deferre this contentment of theirs; that theſe paſtimes might end with a
thing that were juſt, and very agreeable, as ſome recompence to your vertue
would be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palamede</hi> was remounted a horſebacke, with thoſe of his troop, and barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoed
up the Judges with the reſt of the people, in ſuch ſort that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for <hi>Diocles</hi> to get out. Then <hi>Melintus</hi> being by <hi>Ariana's</hi> ſide, made a
ſigne that he concurred with the deſire of all, and every one giving him ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
he began thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SYracuſians,</hi> if I were not preſſed by your deſires, I ſhould but trouble my ſelfe
in hindring your recreations, having not a demand to make, but an accuſation:
Nevertheleſſe, as I am forced by your ſelves, and by my owne juſt reſentment; I
declare that it is <hi>Diocles</hi> I accuſe, and who ought to depart from among the
Iudges to be condemned by them, after he hath beene convict of the crimes which hee
can never cleare himſelfe of.</p>
               <p>Then there was heard a great noyſe, every one looking upon <hi>Diocles,</hi> and
he himſelfe was in great trouble, never expecting this buſineſſe might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
<pb facs="tcp:7768:83"/>
him: afterward recollecting his ſpirits, hee made an apologie, that it
was to ſurprize him, and that this was no day for the accuſation of Citizens;
yet for all this the people willing that <hi>Melintus</hi> ſhould continue his appeale,
<hi>Diocles</hi> was conſtrain'd to retire from the reſt of the Judges, and to goe apart,
waiting <hi>Melintus</hi> his diſcourſe, whereupon he might frame his defence: theſe
conteſtations being appeaſed with the noyſe, <hi>Melintus</hi> went on thus:</p>
               <p>THe gods are my witneſſes, if I love not my Countrey to that height, as to have
beene in paine to reſolve of diſpleaſing one of our Citizens, by redemanding of
him the eſtate that he detaines from me; and I beleeve that if my honour had not bin
mingled with my intereſt, I had forſaken my pretentions, and contented mee with
the fortune I am already in. But theſe very gods would judge mee unworthy of the
favours they have given me, if I ſhould let them be loſt; and my ſilence would rather
be thought cowardlineſſe than patience.</p>
               <p>There is none of you but wondred whence <hi>Diocles</hi> riches came; not being a man
that hath ſtore of ſhips for trafficke, or one that hath taken in farme any thing of the
Publike, which are the ordinary wayes from a meane eſtate to attain to great faculties;
fortune recompencing ſometimes thoſe that are wholly addicted to her. The goods of the
earth fall not from heaven in a moment, not being perceiv'd; their originall is not of
that nature; but being things that belong to the poſſeſſion of men, they arrive to no
man without the order of ſucceſſion, or acquiſition. I cannot tell by what ſucceſsion
the goods of <hi>Hermocrates</hi> ſhould fall to <hi>Diocles</hi> ſhare; and for his acquiring
them, that can he not juſtifie by any title. But ſince it is neceſſary for knowing the
ſecret of his affaires, that I declare that of my life, I will conceale nothing from thoſe
that expreſſe ſo much affection to me, not doubting but when ye ſhall have underſtood
the truth, you will render juſtice to whom it is due.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> the greater part of you may remember <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> who by a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
was baniſh'd this City; he thought <hi>Diocles</hi> ſo much his friend, as hee feared
not to commit to his truſt what-ever he poſſeſs'd within <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and the reſt of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> to have the government thereof untill his returne: But <hi>Hermocrates</hi> having
beene loſt by an adventure that came not yet to light, <hi>Diocles</hi> that heard no more
newes of him, was reſolv'd with himſelfe in the end to call his owne all that was
<hi>Hermocrates</hi> his. This uſurpation had for ever beene hid, but that another depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was made to a friend more affectionate, and more faithfull than he. <hi>Diocles</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<hi>Hermocrates</hi> one dayes journey onely out of the City, at what time hee
went away: but <hi>Telephus</hi> followed him as farre as the Port of <hi>Lylibeum,</hi> where
he was to embarque to paſſe unto <hi>Carthage;</hi> and <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> that departed from
<hi>Syracuſe</hi> very big, being at that place ſurpris'd with the paines of child-birth, was
brought to bed of a ſonne, whom <hi>Hermocrates</hi> deſir'd <hi>Telephus</hi> to carry to <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,</hi>
and nouriſh as his owne untill he ſhould returne, being not willing to expoſe
him to the Sea. <hi>Diocles</hi> was not ignorant of this truth: for <hi>Hermocrates</hi> ſent
him the newes of it, and ſo did <hi>Telephus,</hi> and to both of them he gave anſwer of
Congratulation with him: I will not be afraid, <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> to tell you that I
am that ſonne of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> whom you have hitherto thought the ſonne of
<hi>Telephus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(All the people clapt their hands for exceſſe of joy, underſtanding this
ſtrange newes; and <hi>Melintus</hi> continued on.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:7768:84"/>
                  <hi>Hermocrates</hi> had alwayes lov'd you, and you have favour'd the memory of him,
and I know that his very baniſhment was a teſtimony of your affection towards him.
Therefore I make no doubt at all but you receive theſe newes joyfully; ſince you have
both loved him, and are inclin'd to love me alſo. There remaines nothing for mee to
doe, but to give you the proofes of what I ſay, which proofes will appeare ſo cleare,
that you ſhall neither make any doubt of my birth, or <hi>Diocles's</hi> infidelity: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that I could produce many witneſſes; <hi>Hermocrates</hi> as he ſpake to <hi>Telephus,</hi>
gave him a writing ſigned with his owne hand, by which he acknowledg'd to have
put into his hands a ſonne of his that in the place of his heart was marked with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(Telephus</hi> who was preſent gave that writing to the Judges, and <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
purſues.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diocles</hi> himſelfe making anſwer to <hi>Telephus,</hi> wrote to him to <hi>Lylibeum,</hi> that
be rejoyc'd for the birth of this ſonne of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> and that the heart hee
was mark'd with, ſignified that he ſhould gaine the heart of every one, and be a lover
of his Countrey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(Telephus</hi> put that letter too into the Judges hands, which being read
aloud, <hi>Melintus</hi> unbutton'd his doublet, and diſcovering his ſtomacke
he rais'd his voyce, and ſaid:)</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Diocles,</hi> looke upon this heart, that accuſes thine of the baſeſt perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that ever was. 'Tis this heart that reproaches thee for having fail'd of faith to
thy friend; beſides, I doe dot know whether to this crime thou haſt not added yet a
greater treachery than that; by taking out of the world <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> to be more
ſecure of his eſtate. Nevertheleſſe, I will not beleeve thee ſo wicked: But what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
canst thou alleage to colour the uſurpation of what was his? For if thou hadst
no meaning to keepe it, why didſt thou mocke at <hi>Telephus,</hi> when he advertis'd thee
not to aſpire to the daughter of <hi>Ariſtides</hi> by the ſupport of thoſe riches, becauſe <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrates</hi>
ſonne was living? and if thou wouldſt not beleeve that, why didſt thou
not reſtore thoſe goods to them of the race of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> ſince they belong'd not to
thee? See there then the treaſures thou haſt acquired, without running Fortune, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by ſea or land: ſee there the exceſſive gaine thou haſt made returne of, giving
nothing in exchange for ſo many poſſeſsions, but thy faith and thy conſcience which
thou haſt forſaken. This Trafficke was made within thy ſelfe, and thou hadſt nothing
to doe but to deliberate whether to get that eſtate thou wert not to betray thy ſoule.
Thy avarice diſputed againſt thy fidelity, and the decree thy judgement gave in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of it, is the ſole title of theſe new acquiſitions. But 'tis but to abuſe the cares of
the Iudge, and of the people, to ſeeke for other proofes after a caſe ſo cleare: it ſtands
thee then upon to diſavow the writing of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> and thy owne too; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that to report the titles of all thou art poſſeſs'd of; and all this being impoſsible,
I demand of the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> that they condemne thee to reſtore the goods thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
detain'ſt from me, whereby I might from henceforth ſuſtaine the quality of
my birth, and that they ordaine for thy infidelity that puniſhment it hath deſerved.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Melintus</hi> had made an end of his ſpeech, all the people began to clap
their hands, and to cry out, Condemne <hi>Diocles:</hi> but the Judges having made
the noyſe ceaſe, commanded him to ſpeake. Then he requir'd time, for to
<pb facs="tcp:7768:84"/>
conſider upon his juſtification, and ſaid that hee could not anſwer in the
field to all <hi>Melintus</hi> his impoſtures: that he well knew how to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
from them; but that he muſt have ſome leiſure to make the falſneſſe
of what he had ſaid appeare. They gave him the writings that <hi>Telephus</hi>
brought in, and demanded of him if he knew them. He could not diſavow
his owne hand-writing, nor that of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> but hee ſaid all this made
not againſt him, but that he might have gotten the goods before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.
The Judges enquir'd of him, if he had the Contracts of the ſale that
paſſed betweene them. He anſwered, that they were at his houſe, and that
he onely deſired time to produce them. They order'd that hee ſhould ſend
his ſonne <hi>Amyntas</hi> who was preſent, to goe bring them: but then he ſayd
they were not in place where he could finde them, and that he himſelfe had
need of terme for to put them in order. All theſe anſwers being but ſhifts,
and the people never ceaſing to cry out againſt him, the Judges aſſembled
together to deliberate, and after a long time ſpeaking what they had to ſay,
ſome excuſing <hi>Diocles,</hi> that had to that time beene ignorant who <hi>Melintus</hi>
was: others ſhewing more ſeverity, and ſaying that how-ever the caſe ſtood
he was willing to retaine what appertain'd not to him. In the end the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
pronounc'd this judgement; That <hi>Diocles</hi> was condemn'd, not onely
to reſtore into the hands of <hi>Melintus</hi> all thoſe goods he held of <hi>Hermocrates;</hi>
but beſides, to pay him the revenue for the time he had poſſeſſed them; and
that for the infidelity he had committed, he was baniſh'd for three years.</p>
               <p>The people by their applauſes ſeemed to be well ſatisfied for this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and <hi>Melintus</hi> making a ſigne with his hand that he would againe ſpeak,
all was ſilent, and he ſaid; I have hitherto onely demanded juſtice of you,
and now I demand a grace at your hands, which is, to revoke the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Diocles</hi> in my favour, and for the revenue of my eſtate for the time
that is paſt, I give it to <hi>Amyntas,</hi> whoſe good qualities I eſteeme, and will be
a friend to him.</p>
               <p>Every one having admired the generouſneſſe of <hi>Melintus</hi> towards the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and his liberality towards the ſonne, he obtained all that he deſir'd, and
this laſt action brake off the aſſembly. <hi>Melintus</hi> tooke <hi>Ariana's</hi> hand, who
was full of ſatisfaction for the happy ſucceſſe of their deſires, and brought
her backe to her houſe with <hi>Palamede,</hi> and their friends. <hi>Diocles</hi> full of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſhame, retir'd him to his owne houſe; not knowing whether hee
were to complaine of <hi>Melintus,</hi> or commend him, from whom in ſo ſmall a
time he had receiv'd ſo many diſpleaſures, and ſo many graces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dicearchus</hi> who had not aſſiſted at the playes, becauſe of his place which he
quitted to his Nephew, learn'd this newes of a friend of his that preſently
went his way to advertiſe him of it, for to adviſe together how they were
to live with <hi>Melintus,</hi> ſince hee was knowne for the ſonne of <hi>Hermocrates.</hi>
When they were upon that doubt, <hi>Melintus</hi> comes in bringing <hi>Ariana; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamede</hi>
made the recite to <hi>Dicearchus</hi> of all had paſſed, and ſo to <hi>Melintus</hi>
his advantage, that he was oblig'd to confeſſe to him, that he rejoyced for
that good fortune: But after all was retir'd, when <hi>Palamede</hi> ſaid to his
uncle, that they were to eſteeme themſelves very happy in this, that nothing
hereafter could be found wanting in <hi>Melintus</hi> for giving his ſiſter to him,
ſince his birth and eſtate were as great as he could deſire them to be; <hi>Dicear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:7768:85"/>
anſwered, how that deſerv'd well to be thought of at leiſure, and for
that time could get nothing elſe from him. This acknowledging of <hi>Melintus</hi>
for ſonne of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> was cauſe of the death of two perſons; <hi>Diocles,</hi>
whether it were that he was ſeized with griefe for ſeeing himſelfe fallen from
ſo great a fortune, or whether hee repented for having committed ſo great
an infidelity, was found dead the day after in his bed; and <hi>Hyperia,</hi> who
till then beleev'd ſhe poſſeſſed an ineſtimable good, having a ſonne ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd
as <hi>Melintus,</hi> receiv'd a farre greater affliction when ſhe knew ſhe was
not his mother, than ſhe had done when the newes was brought her of his
death, and not able to reſiſt this dolour, loſt her life ſome dayes after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> having much reſented the loſſe of a perſon that held the place of a
very affectionate mother to him, could not for all that keepe any long time
this diſpleaſure in his minde, being too much diverted by his hopes; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelfe reſtor'd to the poſſeſſion of all that could appertaine to him, he
thought nothing could now retard his contentments, being aſſured of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of <hi>Ariana,</hi> of <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> and of <hi>Palamede.</hi> He came every day to
viſit them, and had conceiv'd too high an eſtimation of his felicity, receiving
every moment new teſtimonies of <hi>Ariana's</hi> love, had it not beene for ſome
coldneſſe that <hi>Dicearchus</hi> made apparent to him, though he endevour'd to
hide it with a feined courteſie. <hi>Piſistratus</hi> too rendred many duties to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi>
and <hi>Melintus</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Dicearchus</hi> made more eſteem of him than
his cuſtome was, beleev'd it was but to make him a more honourable refuſe:
yet for all that they were exceedingly amaz'd, when <hi>Palamede</hi> having prayed
his uncle to reſolve on the marriage of <hi>Melintus,</hi> hee gave him this anſwer,
that it was neceſſary he went firſt to <hi>Corinth</hi> with him and his ſiſter, to ſee
their kindred, and adviſe with them about it: that for this purpoſe they would
goe in <hi>Piſiſtratus's</hi> ſhip that was to returne, and that they ſhould both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them for this depart. <hi>Palamede</hi> would oppoſe ſome reaſons to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
but all was in vaine; and when he brought this newes to <hi>Melintus,</hi>
and his ſiſter, he fill'd them both with confuſion: <hi>Melintus</hi> made <hi>Dicearchus</hi>
be intreated by <hi>Palamede,</hi> that he might accompany them in this voyage, to
make himſelfe knowne to their friends at <hi>Corinth:</hi> but he ſaid, that was not
fitting, and it would ſeeme he went to ſpeake of a thing reſolved, if he were
with them. That anſwer troubled <hi>Melintus</hi> ſtill more, not knowing for what
deſigne he intended that voyage, and made thoſe difficulties: For hee
thought he had ſufficiently oblig'd him by ſaving of his life, and more againe
by his oath, to make him forget thoſe ancient enmities.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe all prepare to depart, and <hi>Melintus</hi> one day finding <hi>Ariana</hi>
amaz'd for this neceſſity of parting, full of ſadneſſe ſaid to her, Madam, what
ſignifies this wofull voyage? I know not what end it may have, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
is too ſad, to promiſe me any good. When I thought my ſelfe the
happieſt of men, I finde that good fortune abſents her the more from mee,
and forbids me ſo much as following her. <hi>Melintus,</hi> anſwered <hi>Ariana,</hi> I know
not what my uncles deſignes are: but mine ſhall ever be like yours, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that I am ſeconded by my brother, there is no force can poſſibly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
me. Live I pray you in repoſe as much as you may during this abſence;
and if my being away cauſes ſorrow in you, let the aſſurance of my affection
diminiſh it. Madam, return'd <hi>Melintus,</hi> how happy doe theſe expreſſions
<pb facs="tcp:7768:85"/>
make me in ſo unfortunate an occaſion: but may I be aſſured that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
ſhall ever change your minde? You ought not onely to beleeve this,
ſaid ſhe, but you doe me wrong beſides to make any doubt of it: for it
ſeemes you judge me capable of lightneſſe and ingratitude. Pardon, Madam,
ſaid he, never thought I theſe defaults could have place in your heart; but
loſing ſo many bleſſings by your abſence, me thinks nothing can ever reſtore
them againe to me. What may I hope for more, after the loſſe of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
aſſurances that have theſe late dayes flattered me? Will you have
this misfortune of ſeeing you no more promiſe me any good, when my very
greateſt contentments have brought me nothing but ſo cruell a diſaſter? <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi>
ſayes ſhe, all contentments are followed with diſpleaſures, and all ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
with joy: things that are contrary ſucceed one another: we ſhall have
a little to ſuffer being ſeparate ſo long: but after a while enduring, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
will be more glorious, and more agreeable to us: afflict me not I pray
you with your ſorrowes, my owne are ſufficient for mee; and after I ſhall
know that you ſupport with conſtancy this ſeparation, I ſhall have courage
enough to imitate you. I am of the opinion, replied he, that to have ſo much
courage, is to have but ſmall love: for what ſtrength can be able to reſiſt the
diſpleaſures of my ſoule, being depriv'd of the happineſſe of ſeeing you?
Reſolution can doe nothing to eaſe an evill, which judgement finds more
hard to maſter, the more it ſeekes wherewithall to give it conſolation: to
give over ſorrow, I muſt of neceſſity give over remembring you, and that can
I not but with my life. <hi>Melintus,</hi> ſayes <hi>Ariana,</hi> I know this very well that
our misfortune is great: but doe you complaine of it to me, to this end that
by my reaſons I might endevour to comfort you? or elſe that I by knowing
it, might be ſure to ſuffer as much as you? For the firſt you confeſſe your
ſelfe that reaſon can doe nothing, and for the other you would be cruell to
deſire an augmentation of what I endure. Let us rather comfort us on both
ſides, and as I betray my griefe to expreſſe a conſtancy to you, ſo doe you
ſeeme to have one too, that being content with our miſeries, we may at leaſt
be deliver'd from thoſe we ſeeke to bring one upon another. Theſe words
that came from the exceſſe of a rare friendſhip, brought the teares into <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
eyes; and it was a paine to him, (ſo ſeized was he) to frame this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
Madam, that I had a meaning to increaſe your griefe, were impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
having ſo much love for you: but I am brought to that paſſe, as not to
know how to ſpeake to you; for if I expreſſe my ſufferings, you complaine
of me; and if I expreſſe them not at all to you, what will you thinke of my
affection? <hi>Ariana</hi> perceiving his difficulty of ſpeech, to give him comfort
interrupted him, and ſaid; I will have no more expreſſions of this affection:
for if I ſtill had need of them, you ſhould not already have receiv'd ſo much
of mine. No, my deare <hi>Melintus,</hi> I am more aſſur'd of you than of my ſelfe;
but theſe mutuall aſſurances ſerve for nothing but to make us be more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of this accident: if we loved one another leſſe, we ſhould be leſſe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
for this ſeparation: let us then eſteeme our griefe glorious, ſince it hath
ſo faire a cauſe; and not complaine any more, ſince we would not have leſſe
affection, to ſuffer the leſſe paine. <hi>Melintus</hi> full of ſeizure, and touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
at theſe deare ſpeeches, could not pronounce a word himſelfe, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kiſt <hi>Ariana's</hi> hands that were all wet with the great teares that fell from
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7768:86"/>
him. He was a good while in that poſture, and <hi>Ariana</hi> giving way to an object
ſo ſenſible, let fall too ſome teares from her faire eyes, which ſhe dried, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to hide her affliction from <hi>Melintus,</hi> who at laſt addreſſing him to that
he held, never lifting himſelfe up, ſaid; Faire hands, muſt I forſake you, and
abandon the ſweet pleaſures you favour me with? promiſe me at leaſt never
to receive others in the place of mine. Sweare it to me, faire hands, by your
ſweet reſtraints, I will beleeve you will never be unfaithfull to me: for you
are too delicate to enterprize my death, and too white not to be innocent.
<hi>Ariana</hi> anſwered, I promiſe you for them all you deſire, and will have you
(ſaid ſhe in preſenting them to him) kiſſe them againe, for pledge of their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity:
then ſhe roſe up to divert her from her ſorrow, and that ſhee might
not be taken in this trouble by any one that came in. For <hi>Palamede</hi> chanc'd to
arrive a while after, with whom they diſcours'd upon the occaſion of this
voyage, whoſe true cauſes they could not underſtand. He promis'd <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
to advertiſe him by his letters of all that paſſed, and to come backe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to <hi>Syracuſe</hi> if need were. For to make any reſiſtance to their uncle, into
whoſe hands <hi>Ariſtides</hi> at his death had committed <hi>Ariana,</hi> they could not
thinke it fitting.</p>
               <p>From that day till the depart, <hi>Melintus</hi> could never entertaine <hi>Ariana</hi> in
private; onely he let her ſee theſe verſes which he gave a borrowed name to,
that they might be read before all.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>The griefes <hi>Melintus</hi> felt at this depart can hardly be deſcrib'd; thoſe of
<hi>Ariana</hi> were no leſſe; but ſhe ſo well conceal'd them, that <hi>Dicearchus</hi> never
knew the unwillingneſſe ſhe had to be gone. They were accompanied by
their friends to <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> his ſhip, and <hi>Melintus</hi> could not bid farewell but
with his eyes, to the faire <hi>Ariana:</hi> but this adieu was ſo ſenſible to them,
that ſhe betooke her ſelfe with <hi>Epicharis</hi> into one of the Cabins of the ſhip,
to lye downe upon a bed, where ſhe was drowned in teares; and <hi>Melintus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having taken his leave of <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> and quitted the deare embracings of
<hi>Palamede,</hi> ſeeing her no more, and the ſhip ſailing away, let himſelfe be ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away with griefe, that he fell downe betweene the hands of <hi>Arcas,</hi> and
was a long time ere he return'd out of his fainting.</p>
               <p>His ſute and his love were now divulg'd in <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and the more he was
loved, the more pitty did his ſorrow move: in the end, full of diſcontent
and weakneſſe, he was reconducted to his owne home, for he lodged no more
now with <hi>Telephus,</hi> ſince he had beene reſtored to his eſtate; and his friends
laboured to divert him from his griefe, which none but himſelfe could have
experience of the greatneſſe of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> thinking to have the wind of love as favourable, as that that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his ſailes, went his way to <hi>Corinth,</hi> proud with the ſpoyles hee imagin'd
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7768:87"/>
to carry away, and the conqueſt he promiſed to himſelfe. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> gave
him great aſſurances, <hi>Ariana's</hi> diſcretion forbade him not to hope, and <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>
courteſie made him beleeve he would not be diſpleaſed with his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance.</p>
               <p>He nothing wondred for that <hi>Ariana</hi> ſhunned his entertainment, judging
that in theſe occaſions of being ſought to, maids will appeare modeſt. <hi>Dicear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
who receiv'd him with more freedome, was his ordinary company; and
<hi>Ariana</hi> had no other conſolation, but in ſpeaking of <hi>Melintus</hi> with her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and her deare <hi>Epicharis. Palamede</hi> that became more and more in love
with the beauties of this Maid, never ceas'd rendring her honeſt teſtimonies
of his paſſion: but every houre hearing the reproaches of ſo many light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
he reſolv'd hereafter to make himſelfe be knowne for a faithfull man,
and ſubmitted to all the proofes ſhe could deſire. Having paſſed the Iſle of
<hi>Cephalenia,</hi> they entred into the gulph of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to which they had but
lately given the name of <hi>Lepanto.</hi> At laſt they arriv'd at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtus,</hi>
a Couſin of <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> came to receive them, and bring them to his
houſe, and there they were entertain'd, according as the quality of <hi>Dicear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
and the magnificence of <hi>Sebaſtus</hi> requir'd. This old man was renowned
for his authority in the City, and more yet for being one of the wiſeſt of all
<hi>Greece:</hi> he brought to ſalute <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Ariana,</hi> a young daughter of his
called <hi>Caſsiope,</hi> whom they found very modeſt, and handſome: but when
<hi>Ariana</hi> heard tell of the marvellous qualities of another ſiſter ſhe had, named
<hi>Cyllenia,</hi> who was among the Maids that ſerv'd at <hi>Iuno's</hi> Temple, ſhee had a
great deſire to know her. Her beauty had given her the prize above all thoſe
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> but her wit had made her ſtill more recommendable; and the
extreme love which the vertuous <hi>Lepantus</hi> had to her, leſſened not that repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
<hi>Ariana</hi> was impatient till the next day came, to goe ſee her; and <hi>Cyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenia</hi>
that heard ſpeake of this divine <hi>Ariana,</hi> had no leſſe deſire to judge of ſo
many perfections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> being come in the morning to ſee them, conducted <hi>Ariana</hi> and
<hi>Palamede</hi> to the Temple; and when the ſacrifices were made, theſe two faire
Ladies encountred with ſo much rapture on either part, that there was never
ſatisfaction equall to that. Their ſight was ſo buſie in judging of their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that they never thought of ſpeaking one to another. <hi>Ariana</hi> had a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that farre ſurpaſſed that of <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> but ſweetneſſe and modeſty were
very equall in them: the admirations they had then one of another, were
ſince followed with mutuall proteſtations of friendſhip; and in ſtead of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
jealouſie for the advantages that each ſaw in her companion, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of thoſe merits bred more eſteeme, and affection in them. Preſently
faint civilities were baniſht, from them, to make place for a freedome that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them to conceale nothing from one another. The reſemblance of
their beauties, and of their wits, joyned their ſoules together, and by and by
after, that of their fortunes made this friendſhip perfect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dicearchus</hi> that would put into practice the promiſe he had made <hi>Piſiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
declar'd at laſt to <hi>Palamede,</hi> that he had not brought them to <hi>Corinth,</hi>
but to make up the marriage betweene him and <hi>Ariana:</hi> that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
while he lived conſent to marry her to <hi>Melintus</hi> the ſonne of his greateſt
enemy; and that this was the reſolution they were to take <hi>Palamede</hi> aſtoniſht
<pb facs="tcp:7768:87"/>
at this diſcourſe, labour'd to divert him from his deſigne; repreſented to him
the obligations he had to <hi>Melintus,</hi> the love of his friend to his ſiſter, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all the oaths by which he had promis'd never to wiſh him ill for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſake; and that if he failed there, the gods would not pardon him. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cearchus</hi>
anſwered him, that his intention thought but upon <hi>Telephus,</hi> not on
<hi>Hermocrates,</hi> when he made that oath; and though he were oblig'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it, yet he was not for that ingag'd to give him his Neece. <hi>Palamede</hi>
employed all the eloquence he was capable of, to bring him to reaſon; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
the life <hi>Melintus</hi> had conſerv'd him, and what injury he did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in expreſſing ſo much ingratitude: but nothing could bend this opinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and vindicative ſpirit, that would beſides have <hi>Palamede</hi> advertiſe his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of it, for to take her reſolutions accordingly.</p>
               <p>This cruell newes in ſuch wiſe ſurpriz'd her, that ſhe loſt ſpeech at it; but
<hi>Palamede</hi> ſeeing this faire ſiſter to be tranſported with griefe, and out of all
heart, encourag'd his owne, for to aſſure her that he would not ſuffer this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny:
that their uncle ought to have over them a milde authority, but not
an unjuſt Empire; that he knew well how to defend himſelfe, and her too
from this oppreſſion; and that though he were not at all ſo engaged to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi>
the faſhion <hi>Dicearchus</hi> us'd, ſufficiently oblig'd him not to give way
to him. <hi>Ariana</hi> ſomewhat reſtor'd by this reſolution, prayed her brother to
try firſt if he could gaine her uncles ſpirit by ſweetneſſe: but ſhe was much
amaz'd when <hi>Dicearchus</hi> himſelfe ſignified to her, that nothing ſhould ever
divert him from that deſigne; and not knowing how to be free of her uncles
cruelties, and <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> importunities, ſhe advis'd to ſhut up her ſelfe with
<hi>Cyllenia</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Iuno,</hi> where ſhee ſhould onely have <hi>Epicharis</hi> with
her, while <hi>Palamede</hi> return'd to <hi>Syracuſe</hi> to advertiſe <hi>Melintus</hi> of what paſſed,
and to reſolve together how ſhe ſhould behave her ſelfe. The next day ſhee
prayed her uncle to give her leave to be ſome dayes with <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> who thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
he could better be aſſured of her in that Temple, conſented; and <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
feining that he went to ſee his friends at <hi>Athens,</hi> departed, and embark'd
him ſecretly, to take the way of <hi>Syracuſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoone as <hi>Ariana</hi> was alone with <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> ſhe made her part of her griefe,
and after ſhe had conceal'd nothing from her concerning <hi>Melintus</hi> and her
ſelfe, asked counſell of her what ſhe had to doe. You have reaſon, ſaid <hi>Cylle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
to make your addreſſe to me in this occaſion; it is impoſſible for you to
finde a perſon more knowing than I am upon this ſubject, to tell you what is
neceſſary for the ordering your affaires, and avoyding what is to be feared;
and ſince experience hath ſo well taught me, I will tell the greateſt part of
my life, which will be the beſt inſtruction you can receive. <hi>Ariana</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
her to make her ſo profitable and delightfull a diſcourſe, <hi>Cyllenia</hi> began
to ſpeake thus:</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Hiſtory of Lepantus and Cyllenia.</head>
                  <p>FAire <hi>Ariana,</hi> you have conceiv'd ſo good an opinion of me, that it grieves
me to diminiſh it by the recite I am going to make you: for you ſhall
heare ſuch ſad accidents that hapned to me by my owne fault onely, that you
will hardly beleeve I was ever able to fall into a blindneſſe of that nature:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7768:88"/>
yet in reſpect of the care I have of your good fortune, I had rather preferre
your ſafety to my reputation with you: that by my example you might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
counſels that may be of uſe to you. I ſhall not feare to re-uncover my
wounds for your ſake, and to ſtrike terrour into you, to the end you may
eſcape the ſame precipices whereinto I am fallen. Some comfort ſhall I have
too in my miſeries, if they may but ſerve to hinder you from being miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>Know that <hi>Lepantus</hi> whom you have heard tell of, was of <hi>Naupactum,</hi> a
Towne not farre from hence, ſituate at the mouth of the Gulph of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
who having loſt his father and mother, was not content with the cares they
had taken to have him inſtructed in all neceſſary ſtudies and exerciſes; but
after he had married a ſiſter he had to one of the chiefe of <hi>Athens,</hi> hee came
to this City, drawne hither by the reputation of the great Philoſopher <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midorus,</hi>
who was a particular friend of <hi>Sebaſtus</hi> my father, for to learne of
him the moſt hidden, and ſublimeſt Sciences. Though thoſe ſtudies were
very ſerious, and that requir'd an intire wit, yet hee was not ſo taken up
with them, but that he diverted ſome times to all other ſorts of arts and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileſſes,
where he proſper'd with ſo much glory, as if his birth furniſh'd him
with a good ſucceſſe for all he tooke in hand. <hi>Artemidorus</hi> admir'd this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
genius, and ſometimes entertain'd my father with wonder at it: Hee
came very often to our houſe, where they conferred together concerning
their ſtudies; and being very courteous, he many times eſcap'd from them
to come to ſpeake to me, as if hee were tir'd with the high diſcourſes they
treated of; and he paſſed away the time in my company with ſo pleaſing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
that I ſhould have thought his onely advantage had beene to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Ladies, but that I knew how much he was eſteem'd for things of more
weight: ſo I made a farre greater account of him for that, and honour'd him
as a perſon diſtant from the ordinary ſort of men: Hee expreſt too, that hee
tooke great pleaſure in my company, for that I lov'd to quit the common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of Maids, and ſought to make my ſpirit capable of things our cuſtome
is to be ignorant of: ſo as accommodating him to the ſufficiency of my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he learn'd me faire conſiderations by meanes that were very intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
and when he advanc'd a little, and ſaw that I attained him, he ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
me in that eſtate with thoughts of a higher nature, and bred in mee a
diſdaine of our ordinary conceits, with a deſire to poliſh my ſoule, and make
it more perfect. It ſeem'd he had framed himſelfe what he attempted to love:
and on my part being much indebted to him for that paines, I ſtudied to pleaſe
him, and ſo to uſe the meanes as to be thought worthy of his eſteeme. Some
jealouſie I had, when I underſtood that every body favour'd him, or that he
pleas'd himſelfe in any company, having a feare leſt the kindneſſes of ſome
Ladies might not take him from me, or that hee encountred not ſome one
whoſe wit he might finde more equall to his owne. It ſeem'd there was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
in it, that thoſe that came to ſee me, ever ſpake of <hi>Lepantus,</hi> and thought
me happy for ſeeing him ſometimes, as if all things conſpir'd to make mee
love him; and if he came to our houſe at the ſame time they gave him theſe
praiſes, I well ſaw they were not affected, becauſe every one offer'd them him
with ſo much honour, and approved what he ſaid with ſo great pleaſure, that
I could not be wanting after ſo many perſons, to give cenſures of him to his

                  <p>Is't poſſible, ſaid I, giving him the verſes againe, <hi>Lepantus</hi> ſhould ſtand mute
before her he loves? Not onely mute, anſwered he, but ſo full of reſpect and
feare, that not ſo much as a looke hath ever given her an expreſſion of my
love. You muſt needs, ſaid I to him, feare her extremely, for I know but
very few that would not gladly receive the offer of your ſervice. I wonder,
replies he, you ſhould thinke that ſo ſtrange, when you are one of thoſe that
cannot endure to be loved. Speake not of me, return'd I to him, for I have
reaſon not to beleeve that any can love me: but ſhe you are in love with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without queſtion very lovely, may well beleeve what you might tell her
concerning your affection. Contrariwiſe, goes he on, I love her not but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe reſembles you, and this is that makes me feare, that I be not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the ſame ſeverity in her, which many others have made trial of in you.
I anſwered him; but it was not <hi>Lepantus</hi> that made me thoſe offers; and being
unſatisfied with my owne beauty, I could not beleeve any great effects could
proceed from ſo meane a cauſe: beſides, I muſt tell you, that though I be not
worth the paine to be lov'd, I have not hitherto found a man worthy of my
ſpirit; and though ſome one might preſent himſelfe, I ſhould uſe him as if
I thought him the leaſt of men, and my ſelfe one of the perfecteſt women.
This anſwer ſurpriz'd him, and for a time he ſtood as if he had beene with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all ſenſe; then recovering ſpeech, he ſaid to me; I have then ſome cauſe
to feare, that this beauty reſembling you, baniſh me not her ſight, if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fum'd
to declare my love to her, or at leaſt that ſhe thought not her ſelfe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at me, and her provoked eyes were not to be endur'd. All, ſaid I to
him, are not ſo ill-natur'd, and I would willingly know her, to perſwade her
to thinke well of you. May it pleaſe the gods, ſaid he, you had as much will
to helpe me, as you have knowledge of her. I ſware to him I would employ
my ſelfe heartily therein, if he would let me know her. That would be, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
he, to ſpeake of love to you, which you will never endure. That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
<pb facs="tcp:7768:89"/>
me not, ſaid I, will never offend me. If ſhe reſembles you, replide he,
both in beauty and humour, ſhe muſt have a like thought to yours, and to
make triall by your ſelfe of the uſage I ſhould have of her, I will tell you,
<hi>Cyllenia,</hi> I love you: What would you anſwer? But, ſaid I, that is not ſo,
and therefore I cannot make you the anſwer I would. There is nothing more
certaine, continues he, and all the diſcourſe I made you, was but to make
way for this declaration. I bluſh'd, and aſham'd that I had thus forc'd him to
diſcover himſelfe, told him; <hi>Lepantus,</hi> if the freedome I uſe with you cauſe
this boldneſſe, you ſhall not long time abuſe it: for you muſt either loſe this
liberty, or my ſight. He, nothing amaz'd, anſwered me; You will confeſſe
then I had cauſe to conceale my affection from her that reſembles you: for I
apprehend as cruell an anſwer from her, as that I have drawne from your
mouth. I was now more aſham'd than before, for having beene ſo deceived;
and but for the comming in of ſome company, I had gone to complaine of
him for thus playing with me: yet for all that I flatter'd my ſelfe with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
that his diſcourſe might well be true; and all night long I did nothing
but fortifie me in that opinion, that he would but ſound me on all ſides; and
that if my anſwer had beene more gentle, he would have left off feinings, to
ſpeake more open and plainly to me. It was a ſtrange reſolution of mine: I
wiſhed he would love mee, and thought I lov'd without being loved; but
when I ſaw him ſubmit to me without knowing my deſigne, I tooke upon
me ſo abſolute an authority over him, that I would make him ſuffer as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
a government, as if I had hated him, and would put him to the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elleſt
trials of it.</p>
                  <p>Since that time he liv'd with me as before, thinking I had receiv'd his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe;
nevertheleſſe I would not ſtay there; and my deſire was admirable. I
had a minde that he declar'd himſelfe to me, and was for all that reſolv'd to
take away all hope from him. So I ſought the occaſion as well as he did: and
one day as I ſpake to him of a dreame I had had, he told me hee had put one
of his into verſe, which he ſhewed mee that very time: they were theſe:</p>

                     <l>Have I then dar'd to breake theice</l>
                     <l>Of a reſpect ſo long preſerv'd?</l>
                     <l>And hath my fury then at laſt uſurp'd this licence,</l>
                     <l>Me ſpeake of love ſhe heard,</l>
                     <l>And for this I am baniſh'd evermore her preſence?</l>

                     <l>I feele their venging fire: ſhe flyes away unkinde</l>
                     <l>To a woods privacy;</l>
                     <l>And I in following her loſe both force and wind.</l>

                     <l>Stay cruell one, to ſatisfie you I entend;</l>
                     <l>For if my mouth could you offend,</l>

                     <l>Cruell impoſtor, goe, and plunge thee in the deepe</l>

                     <l>Where nought but crimes and monſters ſadly keepe.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Are you ſtill then, ſaid I to him, upon this reſtraint, not to dare declare
your ſelfe? Ah Madam, anſwered he, you have given me a leſſon not to put
me to that hazard. All women, ſaid I, are not made of this mould. I told
you before, replide he, that ſhe, without giving you offence, is made juſt as
you are. I pray you, doe not deſire me to runne that fortune; leſt aſpiring
to bleſſings I dare not hope for, I deprive not my ſelfe by imprudency of thoſe
I now enjoy. I ſee her, I ſpeake to her, and content my ſelfe with the eſteeme
ſhe makes of me, ſince I cannot pretend to be lov'd of her. But, replide I,
what can you hope will become of your affection, if ſhe have no knowledge
of it? He anſwered me; Since ſhe will not heare ſpeake of it, before ſhee
knowes it, ſhe muſt know it, before ſhe heare ſpeake of it. What know you,
ſaid I to him, but that ſhe knowes of it already, and that there remaines not
ſomething more to be done beſides aſſuring one another? Promiſe me, ſaid
he, that ſhe ſhall not be angry, and I will take that liberty. I promiſe it you,
ſaid I, for the power I have over her. He anſwered me, you have all the
power over your ſelfe: and for this cauſe I preſume once againe to tell you,
that it's you I love; and that you are to be fully perſwaded of it, ſince you
know well there is not a perſon in the world beſides you that I can love. You
imagine, ſaid I coldly to him, to make me anſwer againe in the name of her
you love, and to try me the ſecond time. No, return'd he, there is no fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at all in this I tell you now, and what ever ſeverity I may prove, I
am forced to ſay it by the exceſſe of my affection, and by the aſſurance you
have given me not to be offended. I will not be angry with you, ſaid I, ſince I
have beene ſo oblig'd in the buſineſſe: but I forbid you ever ſpeaking of this
affection: if you love me, you will feare to diſobey mee; and if you love
me not, I will never heare your diſſimulations. Then growing pale as if hee
had receiv'd an arreſt of death, hee durſt no longer endure my ſight; and
caſting downe his eyes, he ſaid to me; Madam, at this time I am not faulty
but for having obeyed you; and ſince to obey your commands, is to faile;
my diſobedience to that you ordaine me, ſhall not be any more a crime. You
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7768:90"/>
are for all that, anſwered I him, to reſolve you on this, or never to ſee mee.
This laſt blow confounded him altogether, and tooke his ſpeech away: ſome
that came in upon us found us in a great ſilence, which hee never brake, but
in his going out when he ſaid to me, I had rather be depriv'd of ſpeaking to
you, than of ſeeing you: and ſince you are ſo cruell, I promiſe I will obey
you all my life. Nevertheleſſe he could not refraine from taking up this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
againe another time, whereupon I alleag'd the promiſe hee had made
mee, and would heare him no more. The day after hee let mee ſee theſe
Verſes:</p>

                     <l>Your owne faire mouth as well,</l>
                     <l>Shall tell it to you in default of mine.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>I confeſſe to you I had a great power with my ſelfe, to uſe him ſo cruelly:
for there was not any thing in the world I could eſteeme like him, nor that I
had a greater deſire to pleaſe: yet knowing that he valued nothing ſo much
as a vertue ſeparate from the common, and that he would love me the better
for thus reſiſting his firſt attempts, I thought I muſt live with him after
that faſhion. But judging then that I had proved him enough, and full of joy
to ſee him ſo touch'd with love, it became me to yeeld a little; and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
my countenance, I ſaid to him with a ſmile, <hi>Lepantus,</hi> I will have you
obey me all your life time, by never ſpeaking of your affection: for I will be
altogether aſſured of it, thinking you too vertuous to be a deceiver. Hee
was ſo ſurpriz'd at this diſcourſe, never dreaming on ſo happy a fortune, that
taking me by the hand he could not tell what to anſwer. At laſt he ſaid to
me, It ſuffices that you have knowledge enough of your ſelfe, and mee to
be inſtructed what you are to beleeve of either: And you have reaſon not
to deſire any words for your aſſurance; ſince all the actions of my life ſhall
declare nothing elſe to you. <hi>Lepantus,</hi> replied I, you have ſufficiently knowne
how much I eſteeme you: If I muſt love ſomething, it cannot be but you:
I permit you to beleeve this, and preſcribe you no law for your manner of
living with me hereafter, being certaine that all your deſires are regulated
by vertue. Madam, ſaid he to me, kiſſing my hand, my paſſion hath for its
object a thing too perfect, for to permit me a thought that may be unworthy
of the cauſe of it, and I receive no ſmall joy for the aſſurance you are pleas'd
to have of it, whith makes me beleeve that you judge it as great as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
though that be very hard to doe. Let us leave, ſaid I to him, theſe
common proteſtations, and live without doubting one of another: 'Tis
not your words, that have taught me what to thinke of you, and one word
onely from me ought to aſſure you of my friendſhip, ſince I durſt ſay it.
There is no more to be done then, replide he, but that you order, how it
ſhall pleaſe you to have me live: whether you deſire I ſhould declare my
ſelfe, or elſe keepe ſtill my affection hidden. It were better, ſaid I to him,
not to diſcover us ſo ſoone (becauſe at that time <hi>Callias</hi> ſought me) you know,
added I, what my father deſires, and I muſt breake that blow, before it be
knowne that I have another deſire: in the meane time live ſo diſcreetly,
that none may perceive your deſigne. I receive, anſwered he, this ordinance
for an extreme favour, and you ſhall ſee in what ſort I ſhall obſerve it. From
that time we liv'd together in a moſt perfect confidence, which we conceal'd
with a marvellous diſcretion; and there were very few that could ſuſpect us
<pb facs="tcp:7768:91"/>
of intelligence: which made us both ſeverally be thought inſenſible of what
belong'd to love, as finding nothing worthy of us. I advertis'd him of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
paſſed, whereupon he gave me counſell, and receiv'd it of me alſo in
that which concern'd him: I told him good tales of thoſe that attempted
to love-me, how they behav'd them in it, and in what faſhion they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd;
he pittied ſome, and laugh'd at others. If there happened any thing
to me, I longed to ſee him, to make my report to: ſo did hee alſo make mee
ſo exact an account of his life, and ſatisfied all I deſir'd of him, with ſo much
care and reſpect, that I became too much aſſured of the power I had in him.
But I ſweare to you, nothing was ſo agreeable to me, as his diſcretion: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſeem'd ſo farre from any deſigne of loving me, as he: He never diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in preſence of all, and of my father too, to ſpeake what he had to ſay to
me, or knew of me, under termes ſo pleaſant, and with ſo much dexterity,
whether in making any relation, or to the purpoſe of what was ſpoken in the
company, that without being underſtood of any body, we did underſtand one
another as well as if we had ſpoke openly.</p>
                  <p>For the ſpace of a yeare we lived after this manner, but in the end having
broke the marriage of <hi>Callias</hi> with much adoe, and ſeeing how difficult it
would be for me, often to make the like reſiſtance to the duty I ow'd my
father, ſince he expreſs'd, that he had no other deſire than to ſee mee very
ſoone married to one of the chiefe of <hi>Corinth,</hi> I counſell'd <hi>Lepantus</hi> to loſe
no more time, but to diſcover himſelfe, though I foreſaw many difficulties:
for notwithſtanding that my father eſteem'd him as much as was poſſible, and
ſaw his condition as conſiderable as his owne, yet was he farre from having a
thought of him, being unwilling to make an alliance out of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Wee
therefore conſulted together of the wayes we were to take; and although
<hi>Lepantus</hi> receiv'd with much joy the permiſſion of demanding me, yet he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
left fearing for all that; for he ſaw that if fortune were contrary to him,
he ſhould not onely loſe the benefit of having me, but beſides the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he enjoyed before, as to ſee, and entertain me with ſo much facility. Well
for all this we were to reſolve, and I promis'd him to expreſſe in his favour
whatſoever my honour might permit: nay, I gave him all the aſſurances of
my affection he could deſire; and upon the ſadneſſe I ſaw him in, I told him;
<hi>Lepantus,</hi> are you not content with the words I give you? tell mee what you
would have them, and you ſhall ſee, if I have not a purpoſe to doe all I can for
you. Madam, anſwered he, the honour you doe me is ſo great that my ſilence
in part is for not knowing how to give you thanks. I have nothing to deſire
of you, but what it ſhall pleaſe you to command me: I had rather from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
be obliged to your good will, for the favours I ſhall receive of you, than
to the promiſe I have drawne from you: but give me leave a little to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the hazardous fortune I am running: there is no mid-way for mee; I
muſt either be the happieſt of the world, or dye: for be you aſſured, that if I
ſee my ſelfe depriv'd of living with you, the readieſt death I can find ſhall be
my deliverer. <hi>Lepantus,</hi> ſaid I to him, fortune, it may be, will not be ſo cruell
to us, and before you loſe all hope, I muſt firſt loſe all ſorts of meanes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you might have ſatisfaction. The power, anſwered he, you have herein,
is ſo great, that if you employ it, I make no doubt of my happineſſe: you
have a father that loves you, and that has no cauſe to hate mee: I dare ſay
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7768:92"/>
our conditions are equall: but a light difficulty many times overthrowes
important conſiderations. 'Tis not here, as with ordinary marriages, where
after the propoſition is once refus'd, the ſmall ingagement of the parties
leaves every thing in the ſame ſtate it was in: but as ſoone as overture ſhall
be made on my part, I muſt ſpend all the powers I have, and my very life
in the acquiring of a good fortune, without which I can no longer live in
the world. I replide to him, Doe but on your part what depends on you,
and for me, doubt not but I will yet doe more than you dare hope: I will
beleeve, the gods will take care of us, and not ſuffer that wee be long-time
divided. Hee tooke my hand, and kiſt it a good while full of tranſportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and joy; and to retire him from that trouble, I told him, we were to
thinke upon the meanes we ſhould uſe. Wee advis'd that though hee had
kindred at <hi>Corinth,</hi> yet it were better the propoſition ſhould be made to
my father by <hi>Artemidorus,</hi> being a fit man to open the purpoſe of it as a
common friend, and capable afterwards to perſwade by the ſtrength of
his reaſons; and that if need were, others might joyne in it: all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
was, to have newes one of another, in caſe the buſineſſe went hard,
for to give advice of all ſhould paſſe, and remedy the diſorders might ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervene.
I could not reſolve of truſting any body, and that was a good
turne for me, for without doubt I had beene betrayed. At laſt I told him,
I had a cloſet that was over a ſtreet where few ever paſſed, and that at
night I would let ſlip a cord to which hee might tye the letters he ſent
mee; and the day after hee ſhould have my anſwer. And ſo that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
on, and hee parted from me with much ſorrow, fearing he ſhould
not ſee me againe of a long time: yet I ſaw him once more, but it was in
company of ſome others, and he had onely leiſure to tell me how <hi>Artemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>
would be for him with an extreme affection, and was to propoſe the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
the next day.</p>
                  <p>I waited for that day with a great deale of unquietneſſe, and in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
I prepar'd my ſelfe to looke well, when <hi>Artemidore</hi> ſhould come to
our houſe: but I was prevented, for my father, returning home to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
I ſaw him looke but with a ſowre face, and walking faſt up and downe
as if he had ſome thought to vex him. I knew that hee came from <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midore,</hi>
and made no more doubt of that made him ſo thoughtfull. Wee
din'd without a word ſpeaking, and after dinner hee went into the Cloſet
where his bookes were, and ſent for me to come to him. I came trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
as if they had led mee to execution, but yet as I entred I recollected
my ſpirits, and as his cuſtome was to ſpeake to me as ſoone as ever any
occaſion was preſented, he ſaid, Daughter, I heard this morning, that
you are ſought of one whoſe deſerts are well knowne to you, and to mee
too: there are difficulties that would divert me from thinking of him, and
there are ſome reaſons alſo to make mee have liking to him: but before hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of any propoſall, I was willing to know if you could reſolve with
your ſelfe to receive him. I deſired to ſeeme crafty, and preventing him,
ſaid; Father, I beſeech you name no man to mee, but beleeve that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he be, I ſhall receive him, ſo he be a fit man in your opinion. Hee
had ſpoken thus mildly to me of purpoſe, well doubting that I was advertis'd
of all, and by and by he perceiv'd my cunning: Then he goes on; No, no,
<pb facs="tcp:7768:92"/>
daughter, it belongs to you to make choyce of him you are to live with,
and I ſhall ſee afterwards if your choyce be reaſonable, becauſe in this
judgement you are to referre your ſelfe to mee; and I will tell you truly
that 'tis <hi>Lepantus</hi> is your ſuter. I could not abſtaine from bluſhing, yet
thinking how all depended of the declaration I ſhould make in his favour,
I anſwered, Sir, <hi>Lepantus</hi> hath too many good qualities, and I have too
often heard you valuing him, to finde any thing to be diſeſteem'd in him:
if he be agreeable to you, I ſhall ſoone let you ſee that I have no other
deſigne but to obey you. This anſwer, though it ſeem'd very faire, made
my ſatisfaction too manifeſtly appeare to him: hee thought the demand
was not made, but that I deſir'd it, beſides the miſtruſt he had heretofore
of our intelligence together, and there was nothing could more have
hurt us, than the knowledge of this confidence that was betwixt us without
his leave; and though he had had no other cauſe to complaine of <hi>Lepantus,</hi>
that provok'd him enough to tell mee with an angry countenance, I ſee
well hee does not diſpleaſe you, but I feare leſt that which moſt pleaſes you
in him, be not that that moſt offends me: goe, I will thinke of it; and in the
meane I forbid you ſeeing him. Thoſe words ſtrangely amaz'd me, and I went
out as full of confuſion, as I had beene before of hope.</p>
                  <p>At night I knew by <hi>Lepantus</hi> letters, that <hi>Artemidore</hi> had propos'd our
marriage to my father, and remonſtrated all the conſiderations that might
move him to it, which hee ſomething coldly hearkned to, and promis'd
to thinke upon it. I counſell'd him to employ all the friends he could make
to perſwade my father, before hee gave any anſwer to his diſadvantage;
becauſe I came to know that hee was greatly offended at our affection;
in ſuch ſort that there paſſed no day that thoſe that had a power over
him did not ſpeake of this buſineſſe to him, whereupon hee would give no
reſolution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lepantus</hi> was very well belov'd at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and as ſoone as his ayme was
knowne, there was none but deſir'd he might ſucceed in it: Every one made
wiſhes for him, and ſaw with ſorrow the torment hee endur'd, becauſe of
my fathers averſion: And for that I was in ſome eſtimation there too, they
thought nothing could better be fitted together than wee two; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
this, that never were humours ſo equall, he not onely loved all that
was perfect, but had rendred himſelfe ſo accompliſh'd withall, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
faire qualities men have paine to acquire, ſeem'd to have beene bred
with him; for me I will not ſay, I was of that perfection, but yet I could
not approve but that that was ſo. Wee did ordinarily give the like judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all things; our courage was elevated to the ſame degree; and wee
affected the ſame kind of life both. Doe but ſee what happineſſe I had poſſeſt
if we could have come to have liv'd together. My father was blam'd of all
for oppoſing himſelfe to our deſires, there being none but would have judg'd
this affection to have beene nouriſh'd of a long time betweene us, and that he
would have attempted nothing but by my permiſſion.</p>
                  <p>I proteſt, it deſpighted me that the world beleev'd I lov'd him, and I
was ſorry that his merit was ſo knowne to all, as it was impoſſible but it
ſhould be knowne to mee too. I would have wiſh'd him leſſe accompliſh'd,
that it might have beene doubtfull whether I eſteem'd him or not; and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7768:93"/>
not knowing how to be reveng'd of this common opinion, ſometimes I
was reſolved to abandon him, and I conſented to make my ſelfe miſerable,
and him too, for to ruine this beleefe at our owne coſt, it is true hee has
payd very deare for that glorious and haughty vertue he taught mee; and
that I well ſerv'd my ſelfe againſt him, of this greatneſſe of ſpirit to which
hee had advanc'd mee, that perſwaded me, it were better to loſe all the
contentments of my life, than it ſhould be ſaid, I were in love. In the
meane time I conſidered not how there is nothing more lawfull, than
to chuſe by honeſt meanes him one thinkes ſhee ſhall be happy to live
with, and when that happineſſe is arriv'd, one cannot but bee thought
wiſe. That errour made mee commit faults I ſhall deplore all my life
time.</p>
                  <p>Though my father had let <hi>Artemidore</hi> ſee, that <hi>Lepantus</hi> was not to thinke
of mee, yet hee refrain'd not ſometimes to put him upon that diſcourſe,
and repreſented to him what fault it was, to refuſe this good fortune
for his family: that hee deſpis'd in <hi>Lepantus</hi> the qualities that other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
would deſire to meet with for their daughters; that if hee loved
mee with ſo much paſſion, it was rather a happineſſe, than a thing to make
him culpable, that the whole City would have an obligation to him, for
the ſtay of a perſon of that merit with them; for the greateſt part of his
eſtate being about <hi>Corinth,</hi> hee offered to ſettle himſelfe there, and never
forſake my father; but all this prevailed nothing upon him. That which
rendred <hi>Lepantus</hi> recommendable, was that which did him the moſt harme;
my father having this wofull opinion, that he was rather to chuſe a ſonne
in law leſſe able than hee, and that would be more carefull of his affaires.
But yet I beleeve the ſtrongeſt reaſon was, that my father (although a
knowing man) retaining the nature of old men, that will have all their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
paſſe with authority, was envious of <hi>Lepantus's</hi> knowledge, and
deſir'd not to have ordinarily at his houſe a perſon that could contradict
him: though <hi>Lepantus</hi> well knew how to give way to all he ſaid with much
diſcretion. My father had not ſo much reaſon to refuſe him, as I had to
love him, and he could not but perceive the deſire I had, becauſe I was
not able to ſuffer any body that ſpake to mee to the diſadvantage of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pantus,</hi>
and farre rejected the parties that preſented themſelves. I know
very well that if I had declar'd to my father that I could not conſent to any
other ſearch, he would at laſt have beene flexible to the tenderneſſe hee had
over me, and the merit of <hi>Lepantus:</hi> but fearing leſt ſo abſolute a reſolution
came to be knowne in <hi>Corinth,</hi> I never had that aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time I was tormented with <hi>Lepantus</hi> vexations, and with
my owne too. I ſaw him at the Temple, but rarely; and with a face ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
that Death hath not a more forlorne one. His letters were not filled
now but with the miſery of his life, and modeſtly he remembred me of my
promiſes. I acknowledg'd he had reaſon, and that his good fortune was in
my hands, but I could not reſolve me: and this ſeverity that made me inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to his griefes, and prayers, in the end wrought in me alſo an inſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to his affection.</p>
                  <p>All that came neare mee, were inſtructed to ſpeake in contempt of
<hi>Lepantus,</hi> and becauſe I knew him too well to beleeve them, if they told
<pb facs="tcp:7768:93"/>
mee any thing that were contrary to the truth; they did onely diſguiſe
his vertues, and made them paſſe for ſo many vices. Thus the charmes
hee had to make him bee lov'd of the ableſt, and reſpected of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
were but an imperiouſneſſe, and a tyrannicke authority which he
uſurp'd upon all that haunted him: his diſcretion was diſſimulation,
and his courteſie artifice: all his good qualities in their judgement were
ſo many defaults. I confeſſe to you, I beganne by little and little to give
place to their reaſons. <hi>Lepantus</hi> abſence effaced every day out of my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
ſome one of his perfections. I ſaid that peradventure my affection
blinded me, and made me imagine merits that were not in him: that thoſe
that were without paſſion judged of him otherwiſe: at laſt beleeving I
was farre more quick-ſighted, and more perfectly judicious, I perceived
not that I became blinde, and without all judgement. Nevertheleſſe there
ſtill remain'd in me a certaine reſpect for <hi>Lepantus,</hi> that I durſt not offend
him by expreſſing my coldneſſe. I was aſham'd to give him that diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
that never yet had the fortune to diſpleaſe me. His letters were ſtill
full of love and ſorrow for ſeeing me no more; and becauſe hee knew that
the gentileſſes, and points of wit he wrote, were very agreeable to me, he
ever mingled ſome of them, maugre the cruelty of his fortune, and the
torments he endured; and many times he ſo forc'd himſelfe, that laying
aſide his griefes, they were throughout filled with ſweetneſſes and elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and to any but my ſelfe would have ſeem'd to come from a man very
well ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>For me, I knew well his conſtraint, and lamented it: but then when
my affection diminiſh'd, I changed my opinion, and judged that if hee
had beene much in love, he would not amuſe himſelfe with thoſe fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes:
if his paſſion carried him away to expreſſe ſome deſpaire to me,
I ſaid it proceeded from the reſpect hee ought me: if hee gave mee any
advice, I tooke it not well hee ſhould trouble himſelfe to counſell me, or
that hee miſtruſted my owne direction: if I met him, and he appear'd to
me with a very alter'd face, finding no more in him that which heretofore
was ſo acceptable to me, I thought I had reaſon to withdraw my affection:
and if ſome hope made him recover his ordinary complexion, I ſaid hee
was not much troubled with love. In the humour I was in, it had beene
hard for him, ſo to have compos'd his face, and his actions, as I ſhould
not have found ſomething to diſtaſte in them. He judg'd well that the cauſe
muſt needs be very ill, that produc'd ſo great a change: for that hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee did nothing which I would not have approved: yet his diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
alwayes ſo perfectly maintain'd it ſelfe, that he never complained of me,
what cauſe ſoever hee might have: He never made knowne any of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances
he had receiv'd, to expreſſe what wrong I did him. So hee diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
his griefe, not daring to accuſe me, and hoping I would uſe his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
better: but that good will I had had for him, began to be quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning I made anſwer to his letters, and gave him new aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances,
with ſome inſtructions for his conduct: ſince I tooke upon
mee to repreſent to him the difficulties: a little after I receiv'd his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
without anſwering him; and at laſt I ſent one of his backe againe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7768:94"/>
without ſeeing it, and cloſed as I had received it. The ſame night that
I did his affection that outrage, and that hee receiv'd that uſage ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of him, I underſtood how hee hardly eſcap'd dying: his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
aſſailed him in ſuch ſort, that they thought hee would have beene
ſtrangled, but for the remedies were brought to eaſe him. I thought I could
no more receive his letters, ſince I ſuffered the ſute that <hi>Callias</hi> renewed.
I let my ſelfe goe with the common opinions, that all the women that live
in the world have not husbands ſo perfect, and yet are no leſſe contented
with thoſe they have; that it were better to obey ones father, than ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the deſires of a perſon that was before unknowne; and if there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
in mee any conſideration for <hi>Lepantus,</hi> I ſaid that hee having a
ſtrong, and a conſtant ſpirit, would learne reſolution by the loſſe of me,
and with this vile reaſon I defended that cruelty that ſent him death into
his boſome.</p>
                  <p>I often conſidered upon the exceſſe of his reſpect and love, that never
ſuffered him to make ſo much as one complaint of me; and the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
hee tooke afterwards, made mee plainly ſee that this ſilence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of no little reſentment hee was affected with. In the end I conſent to
the marriage of <hi>Callias,</hi> and hee is receiv'd at our houſe: Every one won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
at my reſolution, and how <hi>Lepantus</hi> had ſo diſ-ingaged me from lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him. <hi>Callias</hi> was not very vicious, and had no remarkable imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in him: but hee was of the number of theſe middle and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſort, for whom thoſe that have wit and courage, have ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
At firſt I compared him to the moſt part of them I knew married,
and I found that hee might equall them. But all on the ſudden, ſee my trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
memory, that had ſometime concealed <hi>Lepantus</hi> from mee, how it
came to repreſent him with all his perfections; and making compariſon
with <hi>Callias</hi> to him, I found ſo great a difference, that I was aſham'd of the
fault I went about to make. In ſtead of a right ſhape, and majeſtuous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
I ſaw a heavy body, and graceleſſe; in ſtead of that exalted ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that handled rare ſubjects with ſo much facility, and ſo pleaſingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
mee, I found a languiſhing entertainment, and that was capable
of nothing but the meaneſt things: in ſtead of that ſo native courteſie, and
gentile carriage, I ſaw a man that obſerv'd no civilities but thoſe he tooke
from the imitation of others. I begin to regard him with coldneſſe, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with diſguſt, and in the end with a contempt that was more cruell to
me than to him: nevertheleſſe I had let all things be reſolv'd on, and could no
more goe backe.</p>
                  <p>The day that <hi>Lepantus</hi> knew the agreements were to be ſigned, when
I went to the Temple, he came neare me unſeene, and ſaid to me, Never
will I be brought to make any reproach to you while I live; but the death
I am going to ſeeke will never leave you in repoſe. At the ſame time he
with-drew himſelfe from mee; I had not knowne what to have anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him, ſo much did his ſight and words trouble mee; and ſeeing him
no more, an horrour ſeized me, and ſo great a ſhaking withall, that I could
hardly ſtand upright. Yet recalling all the reſolution was left me, I thought
it had beene the laſt agony of our dying friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>I eſtranged therefore, as much as I could, <hi>Lepantus</hi> from my imagination,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7768:94"/>
and rejected the exact conſideration of what I was going to doe; but
when all was ſetled, and by my hand too, and that I had ſhut my eyes to
take this poyſon, comming to open them againe, I perceiv'd that all
thoſe that lov'd <hi>Lepantus,</hi> could no more endure the ſight of mee: the pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the ſickneſſe he could have no cure for, made them have mee in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,
and they eſteem'd me unworthy to have beene ſo well loved of
him: in ſtead of a common rejoycing there was a generall ſilence, and
there was none but the moſt contemptible perſons that expreſs'd any joy.
All this amazed mee, one while <hi>Lepantus</hi> preſented him to my imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
reproaching mee with my infidelity: all his faire qualities came to
aſſault mee one after the other, and ſeeing <hi>Callias</hi> in the place he was wont
to hold, I turned away my eyes, and could not endure him. Every one
acknowledg'd my phrenſies; but they imputed them to my humour,
which they tooke to be ſomething proud, and ſingular. At laſt the day
arriv'd that I was led to the Temple betimes in the morning; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
knowne that <hi>Lepantus</hi> was gone out of the City, for not being a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of an action ſo ſhamefull for mee, and ſo unfortunate for himſelfe,
I never had ſo great deſire to heare newes of him as then, to learne what
would become of him. After I had beene married, I perceived at the
doore of the Temple a man that was not knowne, but I knew he belong'd
to <hi>Lepantus;</hi> and gheſſing hee was not there but to bring this newes to
him, I ſaid to him paſſing by, Goe tell thy Maſter what thou haſt ſeene,
and at what houre ſoever it be, come againe to tell me what he has done
after thy relation. Judge, faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> what care I could have of him,
after the action I came from. The reſt of the day I was ſo full of trouble,
that to ſee my face they thought I had beene ſicke. It ſeemed the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
of thoughts attempted to aſſault me all at once, for to put mee into
the greater diſorder; and ſometimes they provok'd mee with ſuch fury,
that but for the reſtraint our ſex is obliged to, I beleeve I had given up
my ſelfe to deſperation. My ſoule was already filled with theſe confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when about evening I knew that one ask'd to ſpeake with mee. I
preſently imagined it was newes from <hi>Lepantus,</hi> and went in great haſte,
but trembling withall, to know what the matter was. I ſaw it was the
very ſame man, that having taken mee apart, told mee, with the teares
in his eyes, that having paſſed in a Squiffe as farre as <hi>Naupactum,</hi> hee
found <hi>Lepantus</hi> that attended him upon the banke of the Sea, to whom
hee told what he had ſeene, with that hee heard mee ſay; and how <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pantus</hi>
had anſwered him. Stay not a moment to goe tell her againe, what
thou art about to learne; and ſuddenly hee had got up to the promonto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that avances into the Sea, and from thence precipitated himſelfe into
the Gulph, he being unable to have come neere to hinder him. Hearing
this wofull newes, I cryed out, Oh gods! I have made him dye; and
ſtaying no longer by the man, I bade him withdraw himſelfe, and I went
againe into the great Chamber all in trouble, and with wandring eyes.
They enquired what I ailed, but preſently I fell into a weakneſſe. My
father, <hi>Callias,</hi> and the reſt aſtoniſh'd for this accident, laboured to bring
mee againe, and by force of remedies I opened my eyes: then I was
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7768:95"/>
carried to my bed, where I was taken with ſo violent a fever, that it
troubled my judgement, and made me furious. I loſt all reſpect and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and when <hi>Callias</hi> came neare mee, I cryed out, Take away that
Monſter, that would devoure me; ha the villaine beaſt! I am undone,
ſee his venome that he caſts upon mee; and I retired mee as much as was
poſſible. If my father came to reſtore mee to my wits with gentleneſſe,
I ſaid to him, Ha! hangman of thy owne blood, goe cruell man, thinke
not to put mee into the clawes of this Dragon: I will kill my ſelfe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
No, no, thou ſhalt never carry mee thither; ſee <hi>Lepantus</hi> there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to my ſuccours: then turning me againe, I ſaid, Generous <hi>Lepan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
how doe you come to my defence, ſince I was cauſe of your death?
What, have you pitty enough of mee, to goe ſet upon him? Well, on
then, goe kill this Monſter, and take heed hee does not enwrap you with
his taile: Courage, my deare <hi>Lepantus,</hi> ſee already one paw ſtrucke off;
Courage, his blood is loſt; <hi>Lepantus,</hi> one blow more; looke, looke, hee
is dead: then I rejoyced, and thought to embrace <hi>Lepantus</hi> as victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and demanded his pardon for making him dye, with a thouſand
prayers, that were followed with a torrent of teares. I cannot relate to
you all my franticke humours, knowing nothing of them but what they
told mee afterwards: but my tranſport ceaſed not, but when <hi>Callias</hi> and
my father betooke them out of my preſence. Then returning to my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
ſenſe, I could not beleeve what they told mee of my madneſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I felt great vexation of minde for the loſſe of <hi>Lepantus,</hi> and the
diſpleaſure of my errours: And I conſider'd into what miſery I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged
my ſelfe, when I preferred to be miſerable, before any ſhould
know that I loved, ſince I was then both miſerable, and knowne to bee
in love. But againe my fever and fury tooke mee, as ſoone as ever they
return'd to ſee me; as three or foure dayes after, ſeeing how my life was
indangered, and no appearance this marriage could be conſummate, for
what I had expreſt for <hi>Lepantus,</hi> and againſt <hi>Callias,</hi> they were reſolv'd
at laſt to aſſure mee, that he ſhould not be my husband: then my fever
much abated; and when all the agreements were quite broke, becauſe
of my averſion, by little and little I recovered my health; but I had
ſtill left ſo great a griefe for <hi>Lepantus</hi> death, that never ſince could I
finde any contentment. At all inſtants his faire qualities, and the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I had to him came into my minde: the fault for having brought
him to dye, is to mee ſo cruell a remembrance, that it gives mee no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
and I have found too true that he fore-told mee. In the end I was
reſolved to put my ſelfe into this Temple, for to ſpend my dayes in the
ſervice of the gods; ſince I ſo ill knew how to uſe the good fortune
they had offered me amongſt men. And this is that, my deare <hi>Ariana,</hi>
I have to tell you of my life, that it may ſerve you for example, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your falling into the ſame faults, that have beene cauſe of ſo much
affliction to mee, for I ſee that your affaires take the very ſame way
that mine did, and if you be no wiſer than I, you will make your ſelfe as
miſerable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariana</hi> who had given great attention to this diſcourſe, then brake
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7768:95"/>
her ſilence, and ſaid; I have had much contentment to heare the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of your life, but as much diſpleaſure withall to know the misfortune
of it. I finde that in ſome things you are blameable, and in others excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable;
becauſe you were injurious to forget the merit of <hi>Lepantus,</hi> and to
be changing in effect: but on the other ſide, the authoritie of a father is
very great, and I doe not know how I my ſelfe ſhould have reſiſted it.
Heretofore, anſwered <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> I thought this authority was not given to
fathers, but to this end, that wee might not doubt to render the reſpect
we ought to the wiſedome of their counſels: but ſince, examining all
things, I have found that there is nothing ſo tyrannicall; and that they
onely hide their owne phancies under this cloake of goodneſſe, and love
towards us. <hi>Ariana,</hi> aſſure your ſelfe, our parents have their deſignes quite
differing from ours; after wee have well conſidered of chooſing a perſon,
vertuous, accompliſh'd, and conformable to our humour, to paſſe our life
with in honour and repoſe, they come to regard him with other eyes;
they will be onely ſatisfied, and ſuffer no inconvenience: our happineſſe
is the leaſt thing they conſider; if they have ſome little cauſe of hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that we deſire, or ſome intereſt that obliges them to deſire what we
avoyd; to conceale the true cauſe of their owne paſſions, they will blame
ours; they will repreſent us the obedience we owe them, and what ſhame
it is to make our ſelves be ſpoken of, ſerving them of our very vertues for
to make us miſerable: then they employ their power againſt our weakneſſe;
for there is no doubt (and you will confeſſe that in this ſubject I have
made my ſelfe very learned to my coſt) that if our underſtanding bee
not well fortified by reaſon, it will many times waver in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of an enterpriſe, and be driven out of the conſiderations upon which
it was founded, by other very light ones for the moſt part. We ought
to doe nothing we have not well thought of, and approved; that nothing
afterwards may be capable of making us repent, for the lightneſſe of our
judgements; for repentance makes the thing ill, which of it ſelfe was
good; and the election that is founded upon a certaine ſcience, and firme
diſcourſe of reaſon, ought never to be changed. Thus when wee have
knowne a perſon to be of a happy birth, endowed with all honeſt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and for theſe juſt reſpects have found him worthy of our friendſhip,
and have beene willing to expreſſe this eſteeme of him, that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his aſſurances, and returned him ours; there is no more conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that ſhould diſ-ingage us; our ſoule is given to him, when wee have
entertain'd his: heaven hath allied us, our vertue can no more conſent to
undoe what we have done, and the thoughts that move us to dreame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other ſubjects, are all of them criminall, and againſt the honour of our
ſex, that cannot endure there ſhould exiſt a man to whom in effect we have
given our heart, while another ſhall enjoy our bodies: this meditation alone
is a perpetuall executioner to us, what-ever face we put on, and what pretence
ſoever we take for the excuſe of our Fightneſſe.</p>
                  <p>I perceive, interrupted <hi>Ariana,</hi> that you have well ſtudied theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
and ſhall have cauſe to miſtruſt my owne courage, ſince yours
being grounded on ſo good ſenſe, was able to give way to difficulties. Truly,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7768:96"/>
replied <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> peradventure you need not feare falling into the like errors,
that I have done; becauſe the authority of an Vncle is not ſo powerfull, as
that of a father, and beſides you have more ſtrength of wit than I: but
above all, never perſwade your ſelfe that the affection you have for <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
can be annihilated, whether by reſolution, or by time; for feare you
abandon not upon that hope all the proſperity of your life. See then, <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
when by a mature knowledge of vertues and deſerts, two wils are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
equall, 'tis now no more a paſſion, but 'tis reaſon that loves. We
cannot hope that ever ſuch affections ſhould be ſeparate from our ſoules;
there arrive many times accidents that may trouble us, and make us receive
falſe opinions; but when thoſe fancies are diſſipated, the firſt impreſſions
that cannot be diſſolved, appeare as ingraved as ever before, and are felt
in their whole ſtrength; and judge you in what eſtate one is, if during
the trouble of judgement, one has committed ſo great a fault as cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
be repaired. We muſt confeſſe, anſwered <hi>Ariana,</hi> that men have
much more force in reſolutions, than wee: for when they have once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a deſigne that is of importance to the good of their whole life, they
maintaine it to the very laſt breath, and doe all things poſſible to put it to
effect: Contrariwiſe, our ſpirit ſlackens to the leaſt obſtacle; we know not
what will become of us; and our feebleneſſe hinders us from clearing the
meaneſt paſſage, for the attaining of ſupreme felicities. 'Tis true, purſues
<hi>Cyllenia,</hi> but why ſhould not one woman be found amongſt us, to expreſſe a
reſolution, and to relieve the honour of our ſex? Faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> if I have
thus failed for want of courage, doe not you the like; acquire to your
ſelfe with much glory, much contentment. Nature hath given us ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
not onely to conſerve our lives, but alſo to make them happy: for
the firſt ſhe has given us the love of our ſelves; and for the ſecond ſhe will
have us love ſome other thing: but becauſe the love of our ſelves is firſt, the
more the thing we love reſembles us, the more happy are we when we can
poſſeſſe it. So when two ſoules meet, alike in goodneſſe, ſweetneſſe, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
'tis a treaſure cannot be eſteemed; and ſuch a rancounter is made but
once in an age: and theſe are to deſpiſe all the hinderances they finde of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting
themſelves together, to the end they may enjoy the perfect content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of ſo faire a friendſhip; for after they be once knowne and lov'd one
of another, if it chances they be divided, it cannot be without an inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
violence, and without ſuffering afterwards as cruell puniſhments as they
had promis'd to themſelves pleaſures of eternall converſation together. We
muſt needs thinke, replied <hi>Ariana,</hi> that theſe felicities are exceeding great,
ſince the onely hope I have to live one day with <hi>Melintus,</hi> raviſhes mee:
for to tell you the ſecret of my thoughts, I doe not beleeve that any thing
but the death of one of us, can ever be able to keepe me from them; I thinke
the time long till he be here arriv'd with my brother, that you may judge
whether I have reaſon to love him; and that we may all together take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
how we are to divert my uncle's deſignes, for the favouring of our owne.
I ſhall be very glad, anſwered <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> to give my advice in thoſe conferences,
and aſſure your ſelfe my reſolutions ſhall not be leſſe generous.</p>
                  <p>Theſe faire Maids entertain'd one another often thus, during the abſence
<pb facs="tcp:7768:96"/>
of <hi>Palamede,</hi> and attending with impatiency his returne, and <hi>Melintus</hi> his;
ſometimes the gentile <hi>Epicharis</hi> interpos'd her counſels, being lov'd of them

                  <p>
                     <hi>Dicearchus</hi> many times came to ſee them, and purſued his Neece to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

of her brother. Neither did <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> faile of his reſpects to her, hoping
to gaine by the expreſſions of his affection, what <hi>Melintus</hi> had already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by ſo great a number of merits and ſervices, that <hi>Ariana's,</hi> diſ-acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
had farre ſurpaſſed that of her uncle, if ſhe ſhould have ſo much

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the cruell depart of <hi>Ariana, Melintus</hi> had baniſh'd
from his ſoule all kinds of joy, and ſeem'd to have loſt
by abſenting her from his ſight, ſo many faire qualities
that made him admirable. This ſpirit ſo generous, ſo
ſage and courteous, now languiſh'd overwhelm'd with
griefe, without any appearance of vertue, receiving
his friends reſpects without expreſſing a reſentment to
them, and altogether careleſſe of returning any. He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as much as his diſeaſe, the divertments that might eaſe him, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd
nothing but that profound ſadneſſe that conſumed him. He had no
contentment but when he redemanded of his memory the deare pledge it
had in keeping the divine Idea of his faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> which never preſented
her to his imagination but with a pomp worthy of her, accompanied with
lights that rendred her all bright, full of charmes and graces, and who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to ſend him amorous regards for to comfort him in this abſence, and
aſſure him of her fidelity. But ſtill this pleaſure was troubled with many
vexations; preſently was bred a wiſh to ſee thoſe beauties otherwiſe than
by Idea, then followed an impatient deſire, if not to poſſeſſe them, at leaſt
to enjoy the favours that were heretofore permitted him: but this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
deſire being acknowledg'd impotent and deſtitute of all ſuccours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plunged
him into the exceſſe of his afflictions.</p>
               <p>They are but ſenſleſſe people that can be happy by phantaſie; becauſe
their judgement nothing operative, and unable to diſcerne the falſe from
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7768:98"/>
the true, they receive and reſent their imaginary good things as true ones.
<hi>Melintus</hi> on the contrary was not miſerable but for having too much ſenſe:
the ſolidity of his judgement repelled, in deſpight of himſelfe, theſe vaine
illuſions; and brought him to ſee and feele the truth of his diſgrace, with all
the miſeries that accompanied it. If he ſometimes laboured to releeve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by meditations of vertue, which teacheth to contemne humane ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
as things that are without us, and whereof wee have not the juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and if his courage made a hard ſtrife to find comfort in this ſeparation,
conſidering it was to end, and that evils that have a terme prefix'd, receive
conſolation from hope; ſuddenly a thouſand cruell ſuſpitions overthrew his
reſolutions. He found that the haſty voyage of <hi>Dicearchus</hi> had no apparant
thing in it, that could be to his advantage; hee conſider'd the proſperity of
<hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> who ſeem'd to triumph over him, having had the power to carry
away in his ſhip, and to hold in his owne diſpoſition his deare <hi>Ariana,</hi> with
thoſe that diſpos'd of her: the advantage of this rivall to be in his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
aſſiſted by his friends, favour'd with a thouſand meanes, having <hi>Dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus</hi>
preſent, <hi>Ariana</hi> and her brother, whom hee would endevour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by all the wayes he could invent; whileſt himſelfe in the meane time
was farre away, uncertaine of all things, in vaine provided of friends, in vaine
cheriſh'd and honour'd of a whole Nation, and in vaine reſtor'd to his illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
and rich inheritance, ſince all this power was of no uſe to him.
Theſe murderous thoughts, ſuſtained by many importunate reaſons, whereof
his wit was but too fertile, purſued cruelly his hopes, and deprived him of
the onely remedy that was capable to ſweeten his troubles. His body partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating
of the griefes of his ſoule, had without doubt fainted under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of ſo adverſe a fortune, but for the laſt preſervative was left in him, the
aſſurance of <hi>Ariana's</hi> affection, and of <hi>Palamedes</hi> friendſhip, which he could
not doubt of. <hi>Palamede</hi> was a friend proved by too many rancounters, to have
the leaſt ſuſpition of; and to diſtruſt <hi>Ariana,</hi> were to adde a crime to his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
which the faithfull love of that faire Lady could never pardon, nor
all the Ocean waſh away.</p>
               <p>How many times for all that, ſaid he, overpreſſed with his feares, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
betwixt aſſurance and doubt; Faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> whoſe reſolution good or
ill, ſhall give me either life or death, pardon a little apprehenſion in him that
lives in ignorance of all that happens to you. If I feare, 'tis that I doubt of my
ſelfe, and not of you: when I imagine to my ſelfe the force of your divine
ſpirit, I feele a power comming into my ſoule, that drives out all defiances;
but to beleeve that I ſhould be the ſubject of an invincible conſtancy, were a
preſumption that would make me unworthy of you. It may be the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of many merits in another, ſhakes your reſolution at this preſent, and
makes you avow that they have more equality with the greatneſſe of your
vertue: it may be alſo you are at this houre generouſly reſiſting the attempts
of a violent purſuit: Me thinkes I heare of one ſide the humble ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and advantageous promiſes; and of the other the counſell full of feined
affection borne out by a tyrannicke authority, by choler, and threatnings: if
this laſt be true, ha! how I envy you ſo glorious a triall of love; and how I
would cheriſh the happineſſe to be expos'd to violences yet more cruell, to
<pb facs="tcp:7768:98"/>
let my paſſion appeare victorious over heaven and earth. How am I happy, if
in theſe occaſions you have me for your ſole object, and how happy doe I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
you too for the joy you receive in triumphing over their attempts and
practices. Thus was it, that <hi>Melintus</hi> flatter'd his paſſion, and ſtrengthened
his deareſt hopes; and if ſometimes a little doubting mingled it ſelfe with his
penſiveneſſe, it was ſo modeſtly, and caſting alwayes upon himſelfe the
fault that might cauſe his misfortune, that even <hi>Ariana</hi> could not have taken
offence at him. But the bleſſing he expected ſtill floating in a Sea ſo full of
ſtormes and ſhelves; and his preſent evils giving him a ſenſe of all their force,
he relapſed continually into his firſt trouble. His friends were oft conſtrain'd
to take him away by force out of his ſolitude, and bring him to the publike
recreations, and ſometimes to hunting, where hee ever ſtole away from the
company, and had no contentment, but when he was in place where he might
freely thinke that he had none indeed.</p>
               <p>If honours had beene capable to have ſatisfied him, the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> had cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his melancholy, eſtabliſhing him chiefe of their Counſell, and erecting
for him a ſtatue of braſſe in the publike place, with this honourable Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>To the generous</hi> Melintus, <hi>that lov'd his Countrey better than himſelfe.</hi> But
all thoſe favours were but a weake remedy for his evill: his face well ſhewed
the diſpleaſures of his minde, ſo ſtrangely was he altered, and his body could
not long reſiſt any more, being depriv'd of nouriſhment and reſt. His dayes
were nights, becauſe he no more enjoyed the light, having his ſight ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
and weakned by watchings; and his nights were long and tedious daies,
ſince he never taſted the ſweetneſſe of ſleepe.</p>
               <p>About the end of one night which he had paſſed away in this manner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſleeping, after having rowled in his minde a thouſand different imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon the ſubject of his cares, he ſpent the reſt of the time hee had to

               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> thus paſſed a miſerable life, having his ſoule perplex'd with griefes,
impatiencies, ſuſpitions and feares; full of uncertainties and doubts, which
is the wofulleſt eſtate a Lover can poſſibly be acquainted with. 'Tis ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
betweene two extremities that vertue, happineſſe, and tranquillity conſiſts:
but there is nothing ſo cruell in love, as the meane betweene hope and feare;
'tis a ſpace filled with confuſion, deſpite, and rage. The minde will alwayes
be acting, hearing and judging; if the ſenſes make no report concerning that
it loves, it knowes not wherein to be employed, it is troubled and loſt, and
turnes it's forces againſt it ſelfe to be tormented and deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>At length the arrive of <hi>Palamede</hi> who came from <hi>Corinth</hi> retired him out
of all thoſe doubts; but it was by the aſſurance he gave him of the misfortune
he ſo feared. He learn'd the tyrannous reſolution of <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> the violent
purſuit of <hi>Piſistratus,</hi> and the cruell perſecutions <hi>Ariana</hi> ſuffer'd, for not fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of her fidelity to him. And yet he was more content to be aſſured of a
miſchiefe that was without remedy, than to live inceſſantly in uncertainty
and feare. His courage permitted him not to deſpaire, and the faithfull aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of <hi>Ariana</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> was too powerfull a ſtay to his reſolutions.
But the Letter he receiv'd from <hi>Ariana,</hi> made him intirely confident, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
him no longer to deferre his depart for <hi>Corinth;</hi> the letter was thus:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>Ariana to Melintus.</head>
                     <p>AT length we have knowne the cauſe of our voyage; they will have me marry <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtratus:</hi>
but to conſent to that, I muſt first loſe the remembrance of you. But
yet I know not what will become of me, if you aſſist me not with counſell and ſuccours:
having nothing for my defence but the friendſhip I beare you, which is an invincible
reaſon, though not fit now to be alleaged. Came away therefore as ſoone as you can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly;
and to the end you may not doubt any thing of me, know that I permit you all
the enterpriſe you have a minde to.</p>

There needed <hi>Melintus</hi> but few ſuch words, to make him goe to the very
extremities of the earth; and inſtantly he reſolv'd with <hi>Palamede</hi> to furniſh
a veſſell with all things neceſſary to ſerve them at all occaſions; and becauſe
they were in doubt whether force was not to be employed, they provided
them of the faireſt and beſt armes they could make choyce of. But although
the love of <hi>Melintus</hi> wholly poſſeſſed him, yet he omitted not to conſider of
things that were more remote; and knowing well that ſooner or later <hi>Nero</hi>
would come to underſtand that they were living, he was reſolv'd to ſend <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi>
to <hi>Rome,</hi> to learne if there were no ſpeech of them, and hee gave him
charge to make his addreſſe to <hi>Maximus,</hi> to whom he ſent rich preſents, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of the loſſes he had ſuffer'd for their ſakes. Having given order on
that ſide, he intreated <hi>Telephus</hi> to take the care of all the goods he left in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily;</hi>
and when he was ready to depart with <hi>Palamede, Amyntas</hi> came to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
himſelfe to him with ſo good a grace, to accompany and ſerve him in that
voyage, that he could not refuſe him. <hi>Erycina</hi> her ſelfe too that alwayes lov'd
<hi>Melintus</hi> as her brother, prayed him to receive him; being deſirous that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myntas,</hi>
who continued paſſionately to love her, ſhould render her this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of his affection, to goe ſerve him in his enterpriſe, that was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unknowne to her. <hi>Melintus, Palamede,</hi> and <hi>Amyntas,</hi> accompanied with
the moſt couragious youth they could be aſſured of, departed, and tooke the
way of <hi>Corinth.</hi> The wind was favourable to them at the beginning: but
preſently there aroſe a South-wind, that forc'd them to goe farre away to
land in <hi>Italy,</hi> what-ever Art the Pilot could employ. This going out of the
way, and reculing of a voyage were very cruell to <hi>Melintus,</hi> that every inſtant
thought it the fatall houre, when they would conſtraine <hi>Ariana</hi> to marry
<hi>Piſiſtratus:</hi> Nevertheleſſe a month and more was he thus to paſſe, before the
wind changed: but as ſoone as ever it was good for them, they put to Sea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
The ſecond day after they were gone, they ſaw comming towards
them a light Veſſell, that ſeem'd to have a purpoſe to ſet upon them. <hi>Melintus</hi>
becauſe he would not be ſurpris'd, put a Caſque on his head, tooke a ſword
and a Target, and advertis'd <hi>Palamede, Amyntas,</hi> and the reſt to doe the like,
and make them ready to fight. They knew inſtantly that it was a Brigantine
of Pyrats, that was very ſoone with them, for they were too couragious to
flye; and when they were hooked to them, <hi>Melintus</hi> firſt leaped into the
Pyrats ſhip, and was preſently followed by <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Amyntas,</hi> which
ſtrangely amaz'd the robbers, becauſe they had never beene accuſtomed to
be prevented, nor to fight onely for their owne defence. This aſtoniſhment
they were put to was attended with a thouſand blowes, that <hi>Melintus</hi> and his
valiant friends gave them in a moment. <hi>Melintus</hi> had already ſtrucke downe
at his feet five or ſix ſouldiers, and all flew before him; but hee was ſtayed
by the valour of a young Pyrat extremely handſome, who wore a gilt Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
cover'd with plumes that over-ſhadowed his face, and gave him at the
ſame time both fierceneſſe and grace; and therewithall he made appeare ſo
much force and addreſſe, that <hi>Melintus</hi> judged him an enemy worthy of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
ſo he inſtantly aſſail'd him, but he wondred to ſee that in what place
ſoever he addreſs'd his blowes, he ſtill found there either his Buckler, or his
Sword. In the meane time it behov'd him alſo to thinke of warding the
ſtrokes of ſo valiant and skilfull an enemy, that gave him no reſt, and for well
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7768:100"/>
defending of himſelfe, left not well offending of his enemy. Yet <hi>Melintus</hi>
had the better of him, becauſe by little and little he made him give ground,
and at laſt avoyding a blow he ſlip'd beſides his weapons, and paſſing up to
him, ran him into the left arme. They came then to cloſes; <hi>Melintus</hi> after
much wraſtling threw him to the ground, and having drawne his ſword out
againe, was going to kill him, but that one ſtayed his arme: He look'd upon
him that held him, and ſaw a man of a good mine, that had no armes at all,
and that conjured him to give life to ſo gentile, and ſo valorous a Captaine.
<hi>Melintus</hi> was contented to take his ſword from him, and advertis'd to have his
bloud ſtanched: at the ſame time he regarded what <hi>Palamede, Amyntas,</hi> and
the reſt did, and he ſaw that they had ſlaine the greater part of the Pyrats, and
that the others demanded their lives, ſeeing their valiant Captain vanquiſh'd.
This young Sea-robber having ſome-while held downe his ſight to the
ground, becauſe he was aſham'd of his defeat, lift it up at laſt to regard <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi>
and ſaid to him, I had never beene ſo cowardly as to have given you
my ſword, and be beholding to you for my life, but that I have a deſigne to
employ them both at your ſervice: for you muſt needs be the moſt valiant
of all men, for having brought me to this eſtate, when I never yet could finde
any that reſiſted me. I pray you therefore, receive me for a ſouldier that
ſhall well know how to obey you, ſince I knew not how to overcome you.
<hi>Melintus</hi> touched at theſe words, that parted from a heart very generous, and
feeling in himſelfe ſome motion that invited him to love him, whether for
the grace that accompanied his countenance and ſpeech, or elſe for a ſecret
affection that all valiant men have one to another, reach'd him out his hand,
and having embrac'd him, aſſur'd him of his friendſhip; he onely ſignified to
him that he wondred, how being ſo honeſt and ſo valiant, hee addicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to a Pyraticke life. <hi>Eurymedon</hi> told him (for ſo was he call'd) that as ſoone
as the trouble ſhould be appeaſed in the ſhip, he hoped not to be condemned
by him for any of his actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> anſwered him, that he would be very glad to learne his fortune, and
becauſe that Veſſell was full of dead men, he repaſſed into his owne with his
friends, and made the faire <hi>Eurymedon</hi> enter too, and him that had kept him
from being killed, whom he told that he would not willingly arrive at <hi>Corinth</hi>
but in the night. <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> who had often run over all thoſe Seas, and ſaw
already appeare a farre off the promontory of <hi>Naupactum,</hi> and the Gulph
which but very lately had the name of <hi>Lepanto</hi> given it, ſince that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Lover had precipitated himſelfe into it, told him they were very neare
it, and they were then to caſt anchor to ſtay in that place. His advice was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and the two ſhips ſeparated, for not falling foule one of another. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rymedon</hi>
having ſeene that his hurt was not very great, applied to it a drogue,
which he was ſure would cloſe up the wound by the next day. Then <hi>Melintus</hi>
prayed him to make knowne his fortune to them, being impoſſible they
ſhould better employ the time that remain'd untill night; and when they
were all retired into a Chamber, he began the hiſtory of his life thus.</p>

                  <p>I Beleeve there is not a perſon in the world that can better teſtifie than my
ſelfe, how much important to the life of men is the encounter one meets
with to be bred and brought up; for if I have done good actions hitherto,
I am altogether indebted to this nurture for them; and if ill, I hope to be
excuſable by the ſame. You will confeſſe this truth, when I ſhall have told
you wherein I employed my time, ſince I came to have any underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
for of that which hapned to me before, I could never be able to learne
any thing.</p>
                  <p>Within the Ionian Sea there is an Iſland call'd <hi>Corcyra,</hi> upon one of whoſe
ſides looking towards <hi>Epire,</hi> is a retreat of Pyrats, where it is impoſſible to
aſſault them. I was brought up amongſt them in that place, without ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
knowledge of what parents I was borne; onely they made me ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
that I was of an illuſtrious bloud. I know not whether they ſtole me
from ſome King being but a little childe, or if it were onely to put more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
into me: but I have alwayes obſerved that they bare a great reſpect to
me, and that from my very infancy they ordained ſome of their number to
ſerve me; and ſince that as ſoone as ever I was able to beare armes, they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
ſubmitted them to my obedience; and thought their conqueſts moſt
aſſured, when they could have me for their Chiefe I cannot tell from whence
the opinion came they had conceived of me, or whether ſome divining A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologer
had not promis'd them ſome great fortune, if I commanded them.
At laſt I found them ever ready to obey me, excepting onely in that which
moſt concern'd me, to know in what part they had found me. Nevertheleſſe
I thought them to be excus'd for refuſing me that contentment, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider'd
they were in feare to loſe me, and that as ſoone as I were reſtor'd to
my Countrey, I ſhould ſeeke their ruine in ſtead of ſerving their fortune. I
beleeve that which made them hope for ſomething out of my courage, was an
action I did, being not fully yet nine yeares of age. Some of the Pyrats had
made a prize, and comming to part it before me, two of them tooke a quarrell
againſt one; and to make him quit what hee had, held their ſwords in their
hand againſt him. I could not ſuffer that unequall combat, ſeeing him that
was alone ready to be kill'd, though he employed all his induſtry and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to defend himſelfe; and without dreaming of my age, or the danger, I
tooke into my hand a little ſword I had, and went to ſet upon one of the two.
I know not whether he fear'd to offend me, or whether by deſpiſing me hee
gave me the more facility to ſtrike him, but I tooke him a blow into the
belly that made him dye in the very inſtant. Preſently thoſe that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
came to embrace me, and gave me a thouſand praiſes, for not having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd
the cowardlineſſe of thoſe two that had aſſaulted one alone. As ſoone
as I came to be twelve yeares old, they began to carry me to Sea, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
care they tooke to hinder my getting out of the ſhip, when they were
going to fight with another, they ever found me in the middeſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
my ſword in my hand, and having ſome enemy under my feet. At length
when I came to have about fifteene yeares, it hapned that he that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all the Pyrats dyed: they choſe me for their Captaine; rejoycing, as
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7768:101"/>
they ſaid, for that they ſhould from henceforth obey a Prince: the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that are uſuall to them in ſuch elections were obſerved, and they made
me an oath of an inviolable obedience, provided, I ſhould maintaine their
privileges. A little while after, to ſhew my ſelfe worthy of that charge, I went
to Sea with two ſhips onely, and ſail'd to the Coaſts of <hi>Egypt:</hi> I was ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
as to take five great Veſſels laden with Merchandiſe, and with them I
return'd to <hi>Corcyra,</hi> where I made part of my booty to all my companions,
who ceaſed not commending me, and calling me their good and their valiant
Prince. In two yeares I made them richer than their laſt Captaine had done
all his life time: yet I will not repeat to you all the prizes I tooke, nor all
the hazards I ran, to come to that which has beene the moſt ſenſible thing to
me in all my life. I attained with age more underſtanding; and having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
lived among them in this error, that the greater the maſſacre and boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
were, the greater alſo was the glory; by little and little I began to be of
another opinion: for it ſeem'd more glorious to me to pardon the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
than cruelly to kill them; and I tooke a farre greater pleaſure in giving
away what I had gotten, than in making treaſures of it. That made me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that the life of theſe Pyrats was miſerable, and that their actions were
repugnant to thoſe that generous courages ought to put in practice. That
which finiſh'd to bring them into deteſtation with me, was that for my good
fortune, being gone very farre in courſe within the Heleſpont, we were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd
with the winter at our returne, &amp; conſtrain'd to ſtay in port a of <hi>Greece</hi>
until the Spring. While thoſe that were with me counterfetted Merchants to
be ſafe in that place, and ſold what they had taken; I loſt not my time, but
went through all the faireſt Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> reſting ſome time in every one,
where I learn'd lightly the exerciſes that are proper to them that follow arms,
and the civilities I ſaw obſerved by the moſt Noble. In theſe Schooles I
well knew that that where I had beene bred, was founded upon wicked
Maxims, and that which our men call valour, and glory, was properly aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinate
and robbery. Notwithſtanding after having ſtaied more than ſix
months to inſtruct my ſelfe thus, I failed not to put againe to Sea with my
companions to returne to <hi>Corcyra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond day after our parting, we perceiv'd a great ſhip that came from
the coaſts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſeem'd to take the ſame courſe we did: preſently we
reſolv'd to ſet upon her, and having a while coaſted her, at length we inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
her, and entred in. The ſight was well enough maintain'd by thoſe that
were within, among whom was the Captaine that defended himſelfe a long
time againſt me: nevertheleſſe I made him in the end deſire his life, and I
pardoned all the reſt in favour of him. I had hurt him in many places, and
was carefull to make his wounds be dreſt; then I carried him with his ſhip
and men to <hi>Corcyra.</hi> My returne was extremely acceptable to the Pyrats, as
well becauſe it was along time ere they had ſeene me, as for the greatriches
I brought, with this Priſoner that was an <hi>Armenian</hi> Prince, who went from
thence Ambaſſadour to <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Vologeſes,</hi> King of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and from
<hi>Tyridates</hi> King of <hi>Armenia.</hi> The knowledge I had that he was a Prince, made
me have a particular care of him; I viſited him very often, ſtaying till his
ranſome might arrive, but I found him in ſo deep a melancholy, that nothing
was able to comfort him. In the end having urged him many times to tell me
<pb facs="tcp:7768:101"/>
the cauſe of his ſadneſſe; this Prince that call'd himſelfe <hi>Araxes,</hi> finding in
me ſome civility, and a great deale of freedome, reſolv'd with himſelfe to let
me know what his griefe was, and ſpake thus to me; If I had no other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
but this to be wanting to my King, whoſe affaires ſuffer a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
by the ſtay I make here, you will confeſſe that I have reaſon enough
to be afflicted: but though the trouble I am in for this be extreme, it is far
ſurpaſſed by another torment I endure. I will not, continued hee, conceale
from you that which cauſes me ſo much paine; and for all you are the ſole
cauſe of the impriſonment I am in, I receive ſo many courteſies from you in
my miſery, that I will willingly make you part of my fortune, as the beſt
friend I have in the world. Know, purſues he, that <hi>Tyridates</hi> my Maſter is the
legitimate ſucceſſor of the kingdome of <hi>Armenia,</hi> by the partage that was
made betweene him and his brothers, <hi>Vologeſes</hi> and <hi>Pacorus;</hi> of whom the
firſt that was the elder, reſerv'd to himſelfe the kingdome of the <hi>Parthians,</hi>
and gave to <hi>Pacorus</hi> and <hi>Tyridates,</hi> the kingdomes of <hi>Media,</hi> and of <hi>Armenia.</hi>
But the <hi>Romans</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Corbule,</hi> having made themſelves the
ſtronger party in <hi>Armenia,</hi> expelled thence <hi>Tyridates,</hi> and made come from
<hi>Rome Tygranes</hi> a ſtranger Prince, grand-child to the ancient <hi>Archelaus,</hi> King
of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and Nephew to <hi>Archelaus</hi> the King of <hi>Troas,</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
liv'd in oſtage with the Emperours; and eſtabliſh'd him King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia.</hi>
This change was very ſad to the greater part of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who
regretted their naturall King of the race of the great <hi>Arſaces:</hi> On the other
ſide many lov'd <hi>Tygranes</hi> better, hoping that the <hi>Romans,</hi> from whoſe hand
they received him, would better know how to maintaine them in peace, than
<hi>Tyridates</hi> who could not reſettle or preſerve himſelfe, but in continuall figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
againſt them. Nevertheleſſe <hi>Vologeſes</hi> having aſſembled all his forces to
reſtore his brother into his kingdome; after there had beene advantage and
loſſe on either ſide, we ordered the matter ſo, that <hi>Corbulo</hi> was agreed, that
<hi>Tygranes</hi> ſhould abandon his pretention to <hi>Armenia,</hi> and that <hi>Tyridates</hi> ſhould
remaine peaceable poſſeſſor of it, upon condition he went to <hi>Rome</hi> to receive
the Diadem from the hand of <hi>Nero.</hi> While they were in preparation of this
voyage, I was ſent in the meane time to the Emperour, for to aſſure him of
my Maſters fidelity, for gage whereof he hath left his daughter in the hands
of <hi>Corbulo;</hi> but I had Commiſſion to paſſe by <hi>Treas</hi> to ſee King <hi>Archelaus,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
certaine conditions that concern'd him becauſe of his Nephew <hi>Tygranes;</hi>
and in that place I encountred all the good or bad fortune I am to hope or
feare while I live. This King has no ſonnes, but the diſgrace is well recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
by the fortune he hath to have a daughter nam'd <hi>Paſithea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt the faireſt and moſt lovely Princeſſe of the world. After I had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the King, I was brought before her to ſalute her; and as ſoone as ever
I ſaw her, a trembling ſurpris'd me, that preſaged, as I beleeve, the miſeries
that were to come upon me for having ſeene her. I left not for all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſuring
my ſelfe; but after ſome diſcourſe I had with her, I felt that I was
ſo taken with her love, that with aſtoniſhment my voyce failed me at every
word. I could not finiſh that enterview, for the contentment my new grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paſſion received in regarding her: On the other ſide, I was aſham'd to
be with her, and unable to entertaine her. Yet at laſt I left her for feare of
being troubleſome; and retiring me to the lodging was provided me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7768:102"/>
profoundly to meditate upon that which had hapned to me. I conſider'd
the beauty, and all the graces of the Princeſſe that forced me to love her, and
whereof I found nothing capable to diſ-ingage me: on the other part I had
regard to the ſmall hope I had to be ever happy with her, becauſe ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd
to <hi>Tygranes</hi> her Couſin, who would ever be more conſiderable than I
to <hi>Archelaus</hi> (though I were of the race of the <hi>Arſacides)</hi> for being the onely
remainder of his blood. Thoſe cruell thoughts were indeed ſtrong enough
for to ruine my hopes, but not to choake my affection; and the violence of
it every moment increaſing, I had no way to eaſe my ardor but in ſeeking to
ſee her: and ſo farre was this ſight from bringing me any remedy, that I felt
a thouſand deſires entring into my ſoule by troops when I ſaw her, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meant to leave me, but render me the moſt miſerable of men. I knew
well that the more I ſaw her, the more I reſented my evill, and yet nothing
was ſo cruell to me as to be obliged to leave her for the performance of my
voyage. All I could doe, was, that being with her when I tooke my leave;
Madam, ſaid I, I am going to <hi>Rome,</hi> whence I would be glad to returne as
happy as <hi>Tygranes,</hi> though I would not willingly bring away with me the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
he acquir'd there. She ask'd me what I meant to ſay? 'Tis this, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
I, that he is come backe from <hi>Rome</hi> with the hope of poſſeſſing you, but
hath brought away with him abaſe and ſervile ſpirit, that makes him unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of ſo high a fortune. I had not taken the boldneſſe to deſpiſe her Couſin
in this manner, if it were not a thing knowne, that his ſpirit was abjected and
growne degenerate, having beene ſo long time retain'd in hoſtage at <hi>Rome.</hi>
She bluſh'd to heare me ſpeake ſo, and without anger, ſaid to me; If this
hope be ſo high as you ſay, it may give courage to thoſe that want it; and
take it away from thoſe that have too much of it. I had onely leiſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne;
'Tis not to loſe courage when it is not loſt but with ones life; and
this is the reſolution I take in the ſearch I will make for the honour of your
good graces. She could not anſwer me, becauſe ſome company came neare
us; and I was reaſonably well pleas'd for having expreſs'd my affection to her,
and the poore eſteeme was made of <hi>Tygranes,</hi> before I was ſeparate from her.
I parted from <hi>Archelaus</hi> Court with a purpoſe to goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to returne
as ſpeedily as I could into <hi>Armenia,</hi> to acquit me of my charge; where when
I had ſtayed as little as I poſſibly might, I was reſolv'd to goe re-viſit <hi>Paſithea,</hi>
the privation of whom was ſo cruell to mee, that all the moments I paſſed
without ſeeing her, were ſo many years to me of inſupportable puniſhments.
Judge, <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> continued he, what misfortune 'twas to mee to be taken
by you, at that time my very voyage it ſelfe was tedious enough to me; and
what kinde of life I muſt lead in this place, where peradventure I loſe the
fortune of my Maſter, and the deareſt of my owne hopes? Then teares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
flowed from his eyes, whereat I was touched, but yet more to
know that I was the cauſe of ſo great a trouble in the affaires of <hi>Tyridates,</hi> and
the loves of that Prince, all which obliged me to ſay to him; I beleeve your
greateſt griefe comes from not daring to hope for any courteſie at our hands;
but I will let you ſee that my ſoule holds nothing of the cruelty of Pyrats. I
thinke the gods have ſent you hither for my ſafety, and it may be too they
have made me be borne to ſerve you. From this preſent I give you liberty,
without expecting your ranſome any longer, and render you all thoſe that
<pb facs="tcp:7768:102"/>
remaine of your men, with the riches you have, which are ſtill intire: but 'tis
upon condition you grant the requeſt I will make you. I have had a long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
continued I, to quit the life of theſe Pyrats, amongſt whom I have beene
educated againſt my will; and thereupon I related to him all you have heard
touching the incertainty of my birth, and the manner of my living untill
then. Now, added I, you may make your voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> and depart when
you pleaſe: I onely deſire this of you, that we may live eternally friends, and
that you tell me where I ſhall finde you at your returne, whether in <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
or <hi>Troas;</hi> for after having abandoned this Iſle for ever, I will returne
to you in equipage worthy of a Prince, that wee may no more be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Araxes</hi> at the beginning of this diſcourſe, knew not if he ſhould beleeve
what I ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſeeing at laſt that I ſpake ſeriouſly, he caſt himſelfe upon his
knees before me, and ſaid, That he made no doubt but my birth was of the
moſt illuſtrious, ſince I did actions that appertained not but to the gods, and
the greateſt Princes of the world: that if he receiv'd of me ſo great a grace,
he had an obligation to me which all his ſervices could never acquit him of,
and that if he were ſo happy as to ſee me one day in <hi>Armenia,</hi> I ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
what reſentment he had of ſo ſingular a favour. In the end he made me
a thouſand oaths, to aſſure me that never man was ſo redeuable to another, as
he ſhould be to me, after having receiv'd an office ſo important to his life. I
lift him up againe, and having embrac'd him to ſweare yet to him an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
friendſhip, we conſulted together, and found that he requir'd at leaſt
two moneths for his voyage: he demanded of me that terme, within which
time he would without faile render himſelfe in <hi>Troas</hi> with the Princeſſe <hi>Paſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi>
if there arriv'd to him no ſecond misfortune; that yet he ought not ſo to
cal the incounter he had made of me, ſince he had gained more in this miſ-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
than he could ever have acquired in the moſt happy accidents of his
life. I furniſh'd his veſſell the beſt I could, wherein I made to be re-imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued
all his men, with what he had loſt; beſides I added to that ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
of my owne, to the end he might remember me, whileſt I ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of my affaires, to forſake ſecretly thoſe that had bred me, without their
doubting of my deſigne. My companions had ſorrow enough to ſee ſo much
riches carried away from them; but they reſpected mee with ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that they never durſt expreſſe any thing of it to me. At laſt I let <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxes</hi>
depart from our Ile, after many embracements, accompanied with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
of friendſhip. Afterwards I was ſome time amongſt the Pyrats, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
more than ever after their mode, and approving all their actions, to the
end they might have no miſtruſt of me. But when I ſaw the time approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Araxes</hi> had given mee, I began to chooſe out thoſe that were the
moſt affectionate to me, to follow me in my enterpriſe. One day having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
them, I repreſented what our courſe of life was, inceſſantly to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
wealth without knowing whereupon to employ it. For, ſaid I to them,
in the ordinary life of men, I finde excuſable thoſe that labour to accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
goods, for the ſuſtentation of their families, or for ſatisfying their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which cannot be done without their ſuccours. But wee have no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
for whom we might have cauſe to travell; and for the degrees of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
we deferre them not to the moſt rich, but to the moſt valiant. What
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7768:103"/>
fury then poſſeſſes us to thruſt our ſelves inceſſantly into perill, and to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the repoſe and commerce of all other men? This ſame valour wherein
we ſurmount others, may make us gloriouſly acquire in the wars, that which
now we infamouſly gaine by rapine. If all the world feare us, we feare all
the world alſo; and meaſuring our number with that of the reſt of men, we
have farre the greater part our enemies. Others againe have this advantage
above us, that being in our power, either they goe out by ranſome, or elſe
receive their death with innocence; and we are certaine being taken, to dye
by the moſt ſhamefull puniſhment can be inflicted upon villaines. Beſides
all this, I doe not beleeve the <hi>Romans</hi> will let us any longer live in repoſe:
there is no doubt but in the returne from the <hi>Parthian</hi> warre, <hi>Corbulo</hi> will
ſcowre the Seas of Pyrats as eaſily as <hi>Pompey</hi> heretofore did. The more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
we have beene of late, the more complaints have wee provok'd againſt
us; and the more we have made our ſelves redoubtable, with the more puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
and reſolution will they come to aſſaile us. Why ſhall wee continue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
after this faſhion, when we may be ſeene among other men with more
honour and ſafety, and with as much advantage? I beleeve I will not give
place in valour to any Captaine in the world, and I am aſſured there are no
Souldiers in <hi>Corbulo's</hi> Army more courageous than you: in the meane time
we let them beare away the ſpoyles of all the earth, and the applauſes of all
men; while we amuſe our ſelves unworthily in running over the Sea, to
wait for the paſſage of a Merchant. Let us goe, my companions, in place
where we may purchaſe wealth accompanied with glory: Let us be friends
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> or enemies; either take part in their victories, or elſe joyne
us to thoſe they aſſault, and hinder their Conqueſts. There is it wee ſhall
prove our ſelves invincible, when all our actions will be authoriz'd with the
right of warre. If I be a Prince, as they would make me beleeve, I will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve
actions worthy of my birth; and if you retaine ſtill in you that
great courage I have had experience of in ſo many encounters, you will not
doubt to follow me in the deſigne I have to render our good fortune perfect,
and our glory immortall.</p>
                  <p>When I had finiſh'd ſpeaking, they all cryed out to me that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to live and dye with me, into what part ſoever I would lead them. I
tooke of them an oath differing from that they had heretofore made me, and
prayed them to keepe our enterprize ſecret; while they put apart what they
had moſt precious, and made them ready to follow me, when I ſhould feine
to make choyce of them to goe out a courſing. I was afraid to arrive at <hi>Troas</hi>
ſooner than <hi>Araxes;</hi> ſo as I let a month ſtill paſſe, after which I tooke leave
of the reſt of the Pyrats, with a purpoſe never to ſee them againe. I confeſſe
to you my joy was extreme, when I ſaw my ſelfe eſcaped out of their hands;
and I thought upon nothing but the new faſhion of life I went to lead, in
which I promis'd me all ſort of contentment and honour. But it is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
for thoſe that are accuſtomed to vice, entirely to quit it, and not againe
to relapſe into their firſt manner of living, when the occaſion freely offers it
ſelfe. Two dayes after we were parted, when we had gone round about the
<hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> and were paſs'd the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> as we entred the Egean Sea, there
comes a ſhip to us, that was found ſo faire a prize, as it was impoſſible for me
to hinder thoſe that were with me from going to boord her. I ſaid enough
<pb facs="tcp:7768:103"/>
to them, is this that ſame generous reſolution we have made? is this the oath
that ought to be inviolable? They prayed me to give them this laſt ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and that it was onely to take leave of their trade. In the meane time
they carried me away, did I what I could, towards that Veſſell, what ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance
or command I laid upon them; and being joyned to it, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
peſle-meſle in: as for mee I ſtayed in the brigantine with my armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſſe,
unwilling to have any part in that action, which I was to ſuffer in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight
of my ſelfe; onely I deſired them to kill no man. Some while after
I ſaw them returne charg'd with quantity of faire Stuffes, which were going
to <hi>Rome,</hi> and came from the <hi>Levant:</hi> they made paſſe into our ſhip young
children very faire, rare horſes, and ſtore of precious Merchandiſes that had
beene deſtin'd for to ſerve the ſtrange luxury that then reigned within the
chiefe City of the world: they tooke nothing but what was rich, and left
the reſt with their lives, to thoſe that were in that ſhip which they let de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.
The greater part of my men fell downe on their knees before me, to
intreat me to pardon this diſobedience, and promiſed that hereafter they
would inviolably obſerve all I ſhould command them. I was conſtrain'd to do
what they had a mind to, then we purſued our courſe.</p>
                  <p>We had purpos'd to goe land at <hi>Troas,</hi> and had already diſcover'd the Iland
of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> when there appear'd to us another Veſſell that came from the Iſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
My companions aſſured me that I ſhould finde in that occaſion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they would not from thenceforth obſerve what they had promis'd mee,
and were reſolv'd to let her paſſe: but when ſhee was neare us, I heard the
voyce of a Maid crying out, Save the Princeſſe, friends, ſave the Princeſſe. I
ſaid to thoſe of my ſhip, that there was an occaſion worthy of our courage,
and that wee were to aſſaile thoſe raviſhers. Preſently wee went to boord
them: it was a ſhip of robbery like unto ours; whereinto I leaped with my
companions: I found there ſmall reſiſtance, though thoſe of the Veſſell were
well armed, and we put all to the ſword; then I entred into one of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,
where I found an ill-favour'd counterfeit man, aſſiſted with foure or
five ſouldiers, that held a young Princeſſe, the faireſt 'tis poſſible to ſee. I
gave three or foure good blowes with my ſword to thoſe wretches, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
this villaine caſt himſelfe upon his knees before the Princeſſe, and ſaid
to her; That if ſhe prevailed to make me ſave his life, hee would learne her
ſomething that was of great importance to her. She hearkned to what hee
would ſay, and after ſhe had a while ſpoken to him in private, ſhe addreſs'd her
ſelfe to me, and prayed me to prepare to fight with another ſhip that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to aſſaile her; then ſhe ſaid to me; Know, brave Warrier, that the man
of the world I moſt hate, had a deſigne to carry mee away farre off from my
Countrey, and with a very pleaſant artifice: for ſo to worke his purpoſe as I
ſhould have an obligation to him, he made two Veſſels be in a readineſſe; the
firſt was this, which he had kept hid behinde a Rocke along the Sea-coaſt,
where I was to walke with my Maids, and in it were thoſe that tooke mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
whom you have defeated: the ſecond is ſtill in the Port, and hee is to
goe aboord it, feining to come to my reſcue; to the end that after hee had
attached this, I ſhould beleeve he had ſaved me from the hands of this man,
whom he choſe the moſt ugly he could finde, to make mee have the more
horror at him, and beleeve that I was extremely obliged to him for ſuch a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7768:104"/>
deliverance: then he was to conjure me by his affection to receive him for
my husband, in recompence of ſo notorious ſervice; if not, he was reſolv'd
to carry me away by force into his owne Countrey. Now, purſued ſhee, if
you deſire to perfect my obligation, I beſeech you not to ſpare him when hee
ſhall aboord us, as he is purpos'd to doe preſently; that he may receive at your
hands the reward his treaſon has merited. Shee ſpake with ſo much grace,
that I ceaſed not admiring the ſweetneſſe of her diſcourſe; and I anſwered
her; Madam, if the duty that commands us to ſerve all Ladies, did not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
me this obedience, your birth, and ſo many faire qualities I ſee in you,
oblige me too much to give you this contentment you deſire; and I thinke
the time long till this Traytor appeare, for to puniſh him before your eyes
for ſo great a villany: but to the end he may not faile to joyne us, I am of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that we paſſe into my Brigantine, that is very like this, and better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
of all neceſſaries: then after having ſet up the ſame colours, wee will
ſinke this, with what remaines of theſe miſerable men; and he will not faile
to take us for the ſame Veſſell that brought you away. This propoſition was
found very good by the Princeſſe, who ſmiled hearing the invention of it,
and at the ſame time ſtrucke a thouſand wounds into my heart. I tooke her
by the hand, and made her paſſe into my Brigantine: and inſtantly I cauſed
divers holes to be made in that we came out of, whereby it tooke water on
all ſides, and a little after appear'd nothing of it above the Sea. I had impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency
till this other Veſſell arrived, ſo deſirous was I to pleaſe this faire Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
whoſe ſweet Majeſty already bound my heart with a thouſand chains:
At laſt I ſee it appeare, and withall gave order to make them feine a ſlow
flight, and that when they ſhould aboord us, they would let a part of them
enter: I tooke onely a helme, and put downe the viſiere for feare they ſhould
be ſhye of entring, ſeeing unknowne faces. The Captaine of the other ſhip
was armed juſt ſo when he leaped into ours, and he ſaid as he entred, Ha trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors!
I ſhall reward you well for carrying away ſuch a Princeſſe; but he found
what he never expected, for I received him with ſo great blowes, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
with aſtoniſhment that they ſpared him not. I ſweare to you I was
aſham'd for ſo facile a victory: yet having promis'd the Princeſſe to puniſh
him before her eyes, I ſtrucke him downe at my feet, and willing to cut off
his head, I made her be called, that he might dye in her preſence: but when
I ſnatch'd off the helmet from this wretch that lay at my feet, I ſtood im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
to ſee it was <hi>Araxes.</hi> Then my ſpirit was troubled with a thouſand
confuſions, to have thus treated him I went to ſeeke in <hi>Troas;</hi> and on the
other ſide I had promis'd the Princeſſe not to ſpare him: whereat ſhe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
I very ſadly regarded her, and caſting me downe at her feet, ſaid, Ha!
Madam, how miſerable am I, I muſt either diſobey you, or kill my friend.
She embrac'd me to lift me up, and ſaid to me; How is't poſſible you ſhould
be friend to ſo wicked a man, being ſo generous as you are? Nevertheleſſe I
will be ſatisfied for your ſake, with the punition he hath received, and will
have you give him his life. I thanked her for this grace ſhe gave us both, and
went to make <hi>Araxes</hi> bloud be ſtopped, which he loſt on all ſides. He was ſo
aſhamed and confounded for what he ſaw, being yet ſcarce diſabuſed, that
he durſt neither lift up his eyes to me, nor to the Princeſſe that was the faire
<hi>Paſithea</hi> his Miſtreſſe: yet he let his hurts be accommodated, and in the meane
<pb facs="tcp:7768:104"/>
time I went to demand of the Princeſſe, if ſhe deſired not I ſhould wait on
her backe to <hi>Lesbos.</hi> This is that, ſaid ſhe, I beſeech you to doe. Preſently I
made <hi>Araxes</hi> be return'd into his owne ſhip, and recommended him to his
people, commanding them to follow mine. Having given order for every
thing, I had now no more care but to entertaine this faire Princeſſe; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the friendſhip I had promis'd <hi>Araxes,</hi> ſtrove to impeach the birth of
my love, yet it kept not ſo good guard, but that there entred by little and
little much paſſion into my ſoule: and I did my ſelfe turne away my thought
from that friendſhip, to favour the ſurpriſe, and betrayed it of purpoſe to let
my ſelfe be taken. This Princeſſe made me ſo great thanks, that I knew not
what to anſwer to her obligeant words; and the more ſhe expreſs'd her ſelfe
redeuable to me for the ſuccours I had ſo timely brought her, the more ſhe
reduc'd me to have need of hers. After having aſſured her of my ſervice, and
that ſhe might diſpoſe of my life, I intreated that ſhe would not declare <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxes</hi>
for author ofher carrying away, which ſhe promiſed me.</p>
                  <p>At length we arrived in the Port of <hi>Mitylene,</hi> where there was already come
running together much people, with the King <hi>Archelaus</hi> her father, who was
then in that Ile, and much troubled to ſet out Veſſels for to follow after thoſe
that carried away his onely daughter. We deſcended, and the King comming
to embrace his deare daughter, demanded her how ſhe had beene ſaved. See
there, ſaid ſhe to him ſhewing me, the man to whom I owe my honour and
life, which his valour hath conſerved me. The King came to embrace mee,
and aſſured me that I might diſpoſe of all his eſtates, in exchange of ſo deare
an aſſiſtance. He asked who thoſe might be that would have ſtollen her away;
and I well knew ſhe would oblige me, at what time ſhe anſwered; I beleeve
they were ſome of theſe Sea-courſers, of whom there was not left a man, for
that their veſſell was ſunke to the bottome. <hi>Araxes,</hi> replied the King, has not
he met with you? No, anſwered ſhe, and it may be he has taken ſome other
courſe.</p>
                  <p>But, continued <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> I cannot but recount to you the peoples rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings
for <hi>Paſithea's</hi> ſafety: there were nothing but exclamations of joy round
about us, and ſo great a throng, that we were in danger of ſtifling. I knew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well that ſhe was infinitely beloved, but the cauſe of that love I ſhall tell
you ſome other time. I commanded thoſe of my ſhip to returne to Sea along
the coaſt, to goe meet with <hi>Araxes</hi> his, who yet appear'd not, and to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
him not to faile to returne to the Court to have himſelfe cured; and that
the King had no ſuſpition of him: I retain'd by me two or three of mine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and with them accompanied the King and Princeſſe to the Palace, where
they would have me be lodged as long as I deſir'd to remaine in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
<hi>Archelaus</hi> demanded me if there were no meanes to know whom they
had ſo great an obligation to. I told him, they called me <hi>Eurymedon:</hi> as for
my birth, that I knew it not my ſelfe; and how they that bred me would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
me that I was of a royall bloud. They were ſatisfied with that for the
time, then conducted me into a chamber, where they prayed me to repoſe:
but I told them my travell had not beene ſo great, as to oblige me to take reſt
before night. I reconducted them into their retiring chambers; and by the
way admir'd the number of Lords that came to kiſſe the Robe of <hi>Paſithea,</hi> and
expreſſe their extreme joy to ſee her againe. And indeed the qualities of this
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7768:105"/>
Princeſſe were admirable, as I came afterwards to know. Beſides her marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
beauty, ſhe had ſo many charmes in all her actions, whether in the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of her looks, or in the obliging familiarity ſhe uſed to all that approacht
her, that ſhe acquir'd not the benevolence onely, but the paſſionate love of
all thoſe that could ſee, or ſpeake to her. All the ſtrange Princes that came
to her fathers Court, could no more part from her: thoſe of the Countrey
that had beene acquainted with her of a longer time, kept in their hearts her
old-inflicted wounds, and the Gentlemen that were ordain'd to ſerve her,
were all pale and languiſhing, to feele themſelves conſumed by an hopeleſſe
love. As ſoone as ever ſhe deſired any thing, all the company round about
her ran to have the happineſſe to render her ſervice: if any indiſpoſition hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to her, it was a generall affliction; and if the gods had deſired humane
victimes for the reſtitution of her health, there was not a man in the Iſle, nor
yet in all <hi>Troas,</hi> that would not have ſacrific'd himſelfe for her. It is not for
any affectation in her to make her ſelfe be loved; nor that ſhe employed any
kinde of artifice thus to acquire all hearts: but it was ſo naturall to her to
pleaſe every one, that not thinking thereupon ſhe produc'd alwayes theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
and ſometimes ſhe was angry at her ſelfe for ſo rare a gift of nature that
contrary to her deſire gave hurts to thoſe very perſons ſhe had a will to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige.
It was then no great marvell, if being ſo univerſally belov'd, ſhe was ſo
of me too: but yet herein was it very ſtrange for me, to obtaine without paine
the honour of her eſteeme, which ſo many Princes of a long time had ſought
with a thouſand duties; and by ſuch an hazard as ſcarcely can at any time be
encountred. <hi>Araxes</hi> being departed from our Iſland by the favour I ſhewed
him, was gone in all diligence to <hi>Rome,</hi> then he return'd againe into <hi>Armenia;</hi>
and preſently he had rendred himſelfe in <hi>Troas,</hi> having employed no more
than two months in all thoſe voyages, ſo preſſed was he with the deſire of
ſeeing <hi>Paſithea;</hi> and the King <hi>Archelaus</hi> deſirous to paſſe away a part of the
Summer in the Iſle of <hi>Lesbos</hi> that appertained to him, he had followed them
becauſe hee would not forſake the Princeſſe, whoſe good graces he labour'd
to gaine by all ſorts of artifices. In the end not able to obtaine of her any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that might encourage him to attaine them, he was reſolv'd to carry her
away, when ſhe were walking upon the coaſt in company of her Maids on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
for that ſhe had ſet houres to be free in without any man to be preſent. But
conſider what miſery was that of <hi>Araxes;</hi> and what fortune I had; he would
have the Princeſſe oblig'd to him for his artificiall deliverance; and my good
fortune would have me give her a reall ſuccours, which intirely procur'd me
her affection. I acknowledg'd her good will to me by this, that being in her
chamber, after the King was retired, ſhe ſaid, ſhe would walke in the Gardens
before ſupper, and gave me her hand to expreſſe that ſhe would be waited on
by me. I was ſo taken with this honour, as I am not able to repeat to you the
tranſport I was in. I confeſſe, I had not yet loved any thing, &amp; was but new to
begin in the entertainment of Ladies: I was young &amp; without experience of
the civilities are to be obſerved; having bin alwayes upon the Sea, &amp; among
Pyrats: onely I call'd to my remembrance what I had ſeene in <hi>Greece</hi> during
the ſtay I there made. Much company paſſed before us, and others followed
us with the Maids as farre as to the Gardens, where the Princeſſe ſeparating
from the reſt, that went off out of reſpect, brought me to a walke, and wee
<pb facs="tcp:7768:105"/>
were left alone together: then deſiring to make her ſome entertainment, as
ſhe ſeem'd to invite me to doe, I ſaid to her; Madam, what greater fortune
could arrive to me, having a purpoſe to ſee this Court, than to have had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
by ſo favourable a meanes? She anſwered me, This encounter is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
onely for me, becauſe without your finding me at Sea, you would ever
have beene a welcome man here, but if I had not met with you, I ſhould at
this preſent have beene the moſt miſerable of the earth. Madam, replied I,
there is no Judge but will avow that your encounter being infinitely more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
than mine, I muſt be the moſt happy in this occaſion; if it be not
for this, that ſo rare a ſight bring me not more miſery than I can yet foreſee.
I can very well, ſaid ſhe to me, take from you that feare, and aſſure you that
if my ſight be not happy to you, at leaſt it ſhall never be unhappy, as long as
your good fortune may depend upon my will. The greateſt glory I have
in the world, is, not to be hated of any; and I muſt be ſo in a great degree of
you, if after ſo many ſatisfactions you have given mee, you ſhould receive
little from me. I was ſtrangely raviſh'd at thoſe obliging words, and mee
thought they gave me occaſion to preſſe her further, that I might receive
greater teſtimonies of her favour: but contenting her ſelfe with that ſhee
had ſaid to me, ſhe brake that diſcourſe to demand of me, whence came the
acquaintance I had with <hi>Araxes,</hi> Madam, ſaid I to her, I can tell you nothing
of this ſubject, unleſſe I recount to you my whole life, and becauſe I will
not conceale any thing of it from you, give me leave to remit that entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of you, untill you ſhall be more at leiſure: I beſeech you onely to
beleeve, that I have too little knowne him for having ever participated of
his maliciouſneſſe. Remember you then, ſaid ſhe, of this promiſe: for I
hope to receive a great pleaſure by underſtanding your fortune; it can be
no ordinary one, and I expect to heare of you actions very contrary to
thoſe of <hi>Araxes.</hi> You muſt know, continued ſhe, that the firſt time he ſaw
me, was, when being ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Tyridates,</hi> he paſſed by <hi>Troas</hi> to ſee the
King my father. I know not what deſigne he had for me; but after hee was
willing to expreſſe an affection to me by ſome ſighes, hee was ſo inſolent in
taking his leave, as to ſpeak contemptuouſly before me of <hi>Tygranes</hi> my Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin;
thinking much to avance his owne affaires, by reculing thoſe of <hi>Tygra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
whom the ſpeech went I was to be married to. I had temper enough not
to give him offence then, by returning to this indiſcretion, what would
ſeeme but reaſonable. But beleeving I ſhould never ſee him againe, I would
let him depart without diſcontentment. About two months after, I ſaw him
return'd to <hi>Trous,</hi> having power againe to make ſome other treaty with the
King my father, while <hi>Tyridates</hi> was gone to <hi>Rome</hi> for to receive the Crowne
of <hi>Armenia</hi> from the hands of the Emperour. I cannot relate you the
tricks and villanies he uſed to gaine ſome advantage upon my will. The mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
I expreſſe to all I ſee, made him ſo inſolent, that he feined not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
all he could upon my wit, which it may be he eſteem'd but weake,
and ſuſceptible of many impreſſions. For to abuſe mee, hee conſulted with
Prieſts and Sooth-ſayers, who would have made me beleeve, that by their
ſcience, and by their immolated ſacrifices, they knew my good fortune could
come from no other part but <hi>Armenia;</hi> that a Prince of the moſt illuſtrious
bloud of thoſe provinces, ought to poſſeſſe me; above all that I well guarded
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7768:106"/>
me from what came from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and from that they had nouriſhed;
becauſe from that ſide there could arrive nothing but miſery to me. Beſide
all this he gained by preſents a woman that lay in my chamber, who was ſo
wicked as to terrifie me by night, and make me heare voyces with pittifull
accents, as if it had beene the Queene my mother, that was dead a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
who advertis'd me to flye <hi>Tygranes,</hi> and to chuſe <hi>Araxes</hi> for my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
Nay, he was ſo cowardly and treacherous, as he dreſſed ambuſcadoes
for to aſſaſſinate his rivall, from which his good fortune onely preſerv'd him.
All theſe practices were diſcover'd to me, but one day before he made mee
be taken away; and he knows not yet that I have had any knowledge of them.
I remember that ſome dayes before he tooke the boldneſſe to tell <hi>Tygranes</hi> in
my preſence, that he was a King without a Crowne, and that hee ſhould be
ſhortly a ſervant without a Miſtreſſe: I could not then conceive what his
meaning was; but ſince I have knowne that he then meditated my carrying
away, whereupon he was reſolved, ſeeing that he gained nothing by his
wicked practices. His unfortunate deſigne was reaſonably well order'd; and
I had beene twice ſtollen away, but that I was deliver'd by you onely from
both thoſe miſeries. See for the preſent if there were ever a man more villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
than this ſame, and whether I have not cauſe to deteſt him above all
things. <hi>Paſithea</hi> left ſpeaking, continues <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> and I was ſo aſtoniſh'd
to heare of ſo many malicious devices, that I ſtood immoveable, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
upon her, at laſt I ſpake to her; Madam, I knew not this Prince to be
ſo traitorous a man, having never ſeene him but a few dayes in a place where
he was retain'd priſoner, whence after he had beene delivered by my means,
he promis'd me his friendſhip for ever: I aſſured him alſo of mine, and I
never ſaw him ſince. I eſteeme him very wicked by this you have learn'd me,
but I finde him nothing crafty withall, or elſe unfortunate, for that endevou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to get your affection, he acquir'd nothing but your hate, wherewith hee
may well thinke himſelfe hated of all the world. For me I abandon him, as
well for your ſake, as for my owne: confeſſing that there is nothing ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
as the friendſhip of a traitor. We encountred then at the turning of an
alley, where we found much company: ſhe had onely time to tell me, If you
loſe on one ſide, you may gain much more on another; there being here none
that will not be pleas'd to have you for a friend. I could not returne, becauſe
we were to joyne with the company; and the reſt of the day paſſed away in
civilities and ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>When I was retired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was in great perplexity how I ſhould treat with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxes:</hi>
but he deliver'd me himſelfe out of this unquietneſſe, for my men
returning to finde me, after they had beene long at Sea told mee how they
had ſeene nothing appeare, what ever care they had taken, and that without
doubt <hi>Araxes</hi> had withdrawne himſelfe to ſome other place. I had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thought therefore, than well to governe the fortune of my affections,
ſince they had ſo proſperous a beginning. The next day I went to wait on the
Kings riſing, who ſtill gave me all ſorts of kindneſſes; then he led me into
the Princeſſe Chamber, whom we ſurpriz'd as ſhe was new comming out of
her bed, but this ſurprize was moſt advantageous for her, and very agreeable
to me, becauſe ſhe had all her necke bare, that was of an extreme white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
All ſhe could doe, was to put before it her faire hands, which though
<pb facs="tcp:7768:106"/>
they were jealous of the marvell of this boſome, and ſeem'd to diſpute beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with it, yet for all that let ſcape the victory by the overture of the fingers
that could not wholly hide it. My contentment ended by meanes of a linnen
cloth they brought that intirely cover'd her, and ſtole away all thoſe treaſures
from my ſight. The King left me with her, ordaining her to entertaine me;
he could not have done me a greater grace, and deſiring to prevaile of it, I
ſaid to the Princeſſe, Madam, pardon that I cannot wiſh ill to the greateſt
enemy you have, ſince he is the ſole cauſe of my good fortune of ſeeing
you. This good fortune, anſwered ſhe, is not of conſequence enough to be
much beholding to him for it. Thereupon ſhe demanded me where he was.
I told her, that having ſent out my people to ſearch him at ſea, they had heard
no newes of him. O! That the gods, replied ſhe, would never returne him
againe to us, for my repoſe and yours! But, continued ſhe, may I not know
how he had oblig'd you to come hither? This is that, ſaid I, I cannot alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
cleare, if I have not the leiſure to learne you with all my whole life.
I will at this very inſtant, ſaid ſhe, give you the commodity; becauſe I thinke
the time too long ere I know your newes: and calling for a <hi>Perſian ſimarre,</hi> or
mantle, to be brought her, ſhe ſate down againe upon her bed, &amp; having made
me come neare her alone, commanded me to ſit downe, and acquit me of the
promiſe I had made her the evening before. Then I recited to her all I have
learn'd you of my fortune, thinking it had beene diſloyalty to reſerve any
thing to tell, from her I had given my heart to. She heard me with much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment
and joy; it ſeem'd too ſhe did already take part in the accidents
of my life. There reſted onely to relate to her what I had done ſince my
depart from <hi>Corcyra,</hi> for to come into <hi>Troas,</hi> when they came to advertiſe
her, that <hi>Tygranes</hi> who was arriv'd from the confines of <hi>Armenia,</hi> came to ſee
her. She bluſh'd, and put her ſelfe out of the bed; at the ſame time I fetch'd
a deepe ſigh, and that ſuſpiration more inflam'd the fire of <hi>Paſithea's</hi> cheeks,
who to cover the occaſion of her redneſſe, ſaid aloud; I am truly very much
aſham'd that <hi>Tygranes</hi> will finde me in this diſorder. And then he entred to
ſalute her, and made certaine compliments: afterwards he addreſs'd to me,
and told me, that he came from knowing of the King the obligation all his
Realme had to me, wherein he tooke more part than any body elſe, having
a great intereſt in the Princeſſe ſafety. I anſwered him, that none was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuable
to me for a thing which my duty alone had ordained me to doe:
nevertheleſſe that I eſteem'd my ſelfe very happy for being ſo fitly encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
at ſea for her ſuccours, and for being cauſe of their contentment. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
by his port and diſcourſe, that he was ſuch a man as <hi>Araxes</hi> had deſcrib'd
to me, that appear'd rather borne for to ſerve, than to command, ſhewing
no greatneſſe of courage at all, and affecting nothing but a few civilities, that
are practis'd among honeſt Citizens of a Towne. A while after a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Princes and Lords arriv'd, and there was nothing ſpoken of but ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and rejoycings for the ſafety of <hi>Paſithea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day was choſen by the King for certaine exerciſes theſe Princes
renewed often in the publike place, for to diſpute prizes in emulation of one
another; their deſigne being no other in thoſe Countries but to pleaſe the
Princeſſe, and enter into her good graces. I waited on <hi>Paſithea</hi> to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
where the ſacrifices were made with much ceremony and joy: as for me,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7768:107"/>
I loſt my ſelfe in the preaſe, having made ſigne to my men to follow me, and
being return'd to my veſſell I went away into the plaine Sea. The Princeſſe
wondred to ſee me no more, and thought I was gone to finde <hi>Araxes.</hi> The
King commanded they ſhould ſeeke me out, and could not know wherefore
I had quitted them without any leave-taking. In the meane time they gave
not over the reſolution they had taken to rejoyce, and all things were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the playes againſt next day. I came to know ſince, that <hi>Tygranes</hi> led
the Princeſſe into the publike place, and having left her with the King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Scaffold, he mounted a horſebacke and went to joyne him to his troop
among the Princes, who would that day ſhew their addreſſe in favour of
<hi>Paſithea.</hi> After diſputing of ſome prizes, they planted in the middeſt of the
place a pillar of wood, to which they faſtned armes in faſhion of a trophey,
that repreſented a man armed. The Princes came on horſebacke running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, and he did beſt, that ſtrucke the faireſt blow into thoſe armes. When
they had all given different ſtrokes, there was heard twenty trumpets at
the end of the liſts, that made all turne ſight to that ſide, and the barrier be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
open'd, the Trumpets entred, and placed themſelves about the field. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after fifty men appear'd on foot richly clothed, each their ſpeare in
hand, and buckler on the left arme, and in the middle of them was a young
warrier, armed lightly, upon a faire <hi>Arabian</hi> horſe, who after that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
had all of them lanc'd their Javelins upon the trophey, came on in a
gallop, and faſtned his into the viſiere of the helmet. Every one clap'd his
hands in expreſſion that that was the faireſt blow was given: but that noyſe
ceaſed, becauſe of the ſame Trumpets that ſounded againe; and thoſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers
having ranged them round about the field, the barrier was open'd, and
there was ſeene to avance by degrees, a great pavilion, of a ſtuffe very fine,
and extreme light, the baſe whereof was carried round on all ſides by foure
and twenty young children very handſome, cloathed in Caſſaques of Carnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſilke embroyder'd with ſilver, with little head-peeces of the ſame livery,
from whence hung downe plumes of carnation and white. When this engine
was brought into the middeſt of the place, two of thoſe children that bare up
the borders before, open'd the pavilion; and at the ſame time was ſeene to
come out of it a great Eagle that flew with the pavilion up into the clouds,
and made ſight of it be loſt. I appear'd then upon a faire white horſe, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with red naturall ſpots. I had my head cover'd with plumes of divers
colours, I was dreſs'd in a proud Caſſaque of embroydery of gold and ſilver,
and managed my horſe, that was in very good equipage. The children went
to diſpoſe themſelves about the Princeſſe Scaffold, and in the meane time
after I had given ſome paſſada's with my horſe, I made him take courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the trophee, and I ſtrucke my Javelin into the Caſque with ſo ſtarke
a violence, that it not onely ſtayed faſtned in it, but the pillar alſo that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
had beene ſhaken before, was therewith overthrowne to the
ground with the armes. My ſtrength was admir'd of all the people, and the
Princes themſelves, but much more when I deſcended from my horſe, and
going towards the Armes, I tooke them with the pillar and all upon my
ſhoulder, and carried them to the Kings Scaffold. I preſented them to the
Princeſſe, and having laid them at her feer, I received of her a bracelet of
great pearles that was the prize, which I kiſſed, and then paſſed upon my arme.
<pb facs="tcp:7768:107"/>
She was filled with a great ſatisfaction to ſee me againe, and for the honour I
had acquir'd in preſence of her father, who gave me a thouſand praiſes, and
invited me to appeare againe at the paſtimes remain'd.</p>
                  <p>Give me leave, ſaid <hi>Palamede</hi> then, to interrupt you; and let us know, if it
pleaſe you, how you were able to finde where withall to make ſo marvellous
an entry. I am very glad, anſwered <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> that you have remembred me
of it: for it may be I ſhould have forgot this. I had by good fortune, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
he, found all theſe things in the firſt ſhip my ſouldiers tooke; the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion,
the children ſo adorned, that great Eagle, the horſe on which I rode,
and the other of my Lieutenant who was a young ſouldier very valiant and
expert; he it was that appeared in the middeſt of thoſe fifty that firſt entred,
who were the very choyce of my companions. For mee having found this
Eagle very big, I tyed a cord to her foot, the other end whereof was faſtned
to the top of the pavilion, that was ſuſtain'd within by the point of a great
ſpeare I held in my hand: and I bare it thus my ſelfe on horſebacke in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
with the children, that lift it up by the borders. I held the Eagle all
that while, and when the Pavilion was opened, I let her goe, and ſhe carried
away with her that pavilion that was but of a light ſtuffe. This invention was
much approved of <hi>Melintus, Palamede,</hi> and the reſt, then <hi>Eurymedon</hi> went on;
The laſt paſtime was, that all they that had appeared in the other exerciſes,
ſhould joyne them together, and ſtrike at one another with Javelins whoſe
point was rebated, onely to ſhew dexterity and grace, which was rather a
kinde of dance, than a combat. They gave mee one of thoſe Javelins, and
remounting upon my horſe, I went to mingle my ſelfe with that company;
but the play was ſuch as greatly troubled the joy of that dayes worke. Two
<hi>Armenians</hi> had put themſelves into the party, with darts that were very ſharp,
and one of them ſtruck <hi>Tygranes,</hi> &amp; wounded him to death; the other addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him to me, whoſe blow I happily avoyded, rather becauſe 'tis naturall to
turne away the body from a dart one ſees comming to him, than for any feare
I had cauſe to have of being hurt therewith: but yet I could not hinder the
blow from piercing me into the arme. Preſently <hi>Tygranes</hi> cried out that he
was hurt; he that gave the ſtroke would have run away with his companion;
and their flight onely accus'd them, for it would have beene doubted whence
the blow ſhould come, if they had ſtayed amongſt us; all was in allarme at
the inſtant, and in diſorder. <hi>Archelaus</hi> came running with ſome of his officers
that aſſiſted him, and as ſoone as he was arrived, <hi>Tygranes</hi> expired, which put
the King into a great ſorrow. But that which aſtoniſh'd all the world, was, that
an old man of the chiefe about <hi>Archelous,</hi> caſt himſelfe upon the dead body of
<hi>Tygranes,</hi> and embracing him, melted into teares, and filled all with his
complaints. The King demanded of him what cauſe he had ſo particularly to
be tormented for that accident. Ha! Sir, ſaid he, let the cauſe of my extreme
griefe ſerve for diminution unto yours. I will tell you then that this ſame was
my ſonne, whom I carried with the little <hi>Tygranes</hi> your nephew, when you
ſent him by me in hoſtage to <hi>Rome.</hi> Your nephew dyed at Sea, and ſeeing that
it was altogether important for the good of your affaires this child ſhould goe
to <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe there remain'd not any of your bloud to be given in oſtage;
I ſuppoſed my ſonne in his place, who was receiv'd for him, and ever ſince he
has beene bred as if he had beene the true <hi>Tygranes.</hi> I beleeve I am not blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7768:108"/>
for making this ſuppoſition, having then had no other deſigne but the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing
of your eſtates; and if ſince I have left every one in this error, it
was for feare the <hi>Romans</hi> might thinke you had beene author of the deceit; but
ſince I durſt not render him any duty of a father during his life, ſuffer me at
leaſt to give him this laſt teſtimony of my affection; and thereupon he betook
himſelfe to embrace him, and to mourne as before. Every one was immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for aſtoniſhment; but the King more than all, who left not for all that to
take care of <hi>Tygranes</hi> body, and to comfort this good man whom he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
proved moſt faithfull. In the meane time they had arreſted the two
<hi>Armentans,</hi> who after ſome torments, confeſſed that they had beene ſent by
<hi>Araxes,</hi> for the diſpatching of <hi>Tygranes</hi> and me; and how they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to deviſe a better meanes to compaſſe it. I had <hi>Araxes</hi> then in horror for
that he would have cauſed my aſſaſſinate, after ſo many good offices he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
at my hands; and I thanked the gods for preſerving mee from that
danger. The King and the Princeſſe had now no other care but of me; they
conſtrain'd me to keep my bed becauſe of my wound, though it were a ſmall
one: and I was not angry for it for being viſited by the Princeſſe, who ſaid to
me the firſt time ſhe was alone with me; Ah, <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> theſe are the preſents
of your good friend. I anſwered her, Madam, a though his intention were
moſt villanous, I know not how to complaine of him; for thinking to take
me out the world, he has taken him away too that would ſoone have filled me
with miſeries, and rendred you unfortunate beſides, for being unworthy of
you. But ſince he is no more, give me leave, Madam; my voyce failed me then,
whereat ſhe ſmiled; and having a while regarded me, ſaid to me, You may go
on: I tooke up my ſpeech, but in trembling, and ſaid, Give me leave, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
to hope. My tongue was tyed the ſecond time; and ſhe ſmiling againe,
ſaid to me, I will not have you make an end: for I permit you to hope all
things. Ha! Madam, ſaid I how happy doe you make me! but when you ſhall
conſider that I am a ſtranger, and unknowne, I may well feare my happineſſe
change not. Your actions, anſwered ſhe, make you to be knowne too wel what
you are; and as <hi>Tygranes</hi> actions could not be but baſe; being no Prince; ſo is
it impoſſible but you muſt be a Prince, conſidering you doe all the actions of
one. I replied; My ambition never made me affect that title, although I
were brought up in the opinion of poſſeſſing it: but yet I will retaine it
for this, ſince it is that alone that may encourage me to pretend any thing
neare you; though my extreme paſſion will take a great part in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe
of acquiring the honour of your good graces. Shee ſaid to me,
I will beleeve concerning your paſſion all you pleaſe to have me: but I
command you to take upon you from henceforth the quality of a Prince,
ſtaying till you may verifie your birth, for to ſtrengthen in the meane time,
and bring to a good end the choyce I will one day make of you. I tooke
then one of her faire hands, which ſhee let me kiſſe a long time; and I
could not let it goe, not knowing in what other ſort to expreſſe my joy
to her. But we were to ſeparate now, and ſhee went her way, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ordained mee ſo to order my affaires as I might know what I was.
I promis'd her to employ all my care in that re-ſearch, ſince from thence
depended all the good fortune of my life. The day after when I aroſe, I
went to ſee her, to give her thanks for the cares ſhe had taken of me. At
<pb facs="tcp:7768:108"/>
my firſt comming ſhe came to meet me, and told me ſhe had ſtrange newes
for me: heaven at length hath delivered us from <hi>Araxes.</hi> A man of his came
to let me know that he is dead of his wounds: but before he died, ſee what
impreſſion he was willing to leave with me of you. Then ſhe preſented me a
letter ſhe had receiv'd from him, where in I read theſe words:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>Araxes to the Princeſſe Paſithea.</head>
                        <p>FAire Princeſſe, I am going to dye for you; and having alwayes had this deſigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I ſhould not regret the quitting of my life, if I loſt it not by the hand of a traytor.
The care I have had to ſerve you, continues even after my death; and I advertiſe you
that he you favour, and who calls himſelfe Prince, is the moſt famous and infamous
Pyrat that ever cours'd the Seas. The hurts I have receiv'd of him, have beene
my recompence for having given him the happineſſe to ſee you, and you are not
to expect but the like treaſon at his hands. If you doe him juſtice, you will rather
let him feele the hand of a hangman, than ever give him hope of the honour of touching
yours.</p>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
                  <p>Ha! the wicked rogue, cryed I out after I had read it, ſee what rage he
is in? The Princeſſe ſaid to me, If you had not acquainted mee with your
life, and I had not beene witneſſe in what ſort you are cauſe of his death, he
might peradventure make me beleeve ſomething againſt the truth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
I muſt not have knowne him for a villaine and an artificiall companion.
But as his other malices have turned to your advantage, ſo ſhall this more
augment the favour I will have to you. The reſt of our diſcourſe paſſed in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of the ſtrange fury of that <hi>Armenian,</hi> and in common aſſurances of
our affection.</p>
                  <p>Since that ſhe could not ſo well hide the love ſhee bare mee, but that the
King perceiv'd it: he expreſs'd to her that it was not agreeable to him; and
in the end he entred into an extreme choler againſt her; ſo farre as he made
me covertly underſtand, he would be glad I retir'd from thence: but I
was deafe to the propoſitions they made me, being too dearely engaged in
that Countrey. I well ſaw that the King receiv'd me with more coldneſſe
than he was wont, and at laſt ſhewed me a countenance that witneſſed a great
averſion to me: but that which loſt us, was, that one day he ſurpriz'd me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
with her in her Cloſet, as I was kiſſing her hand. Then he entred into
ſuch a fury, as he drew his ſword, and had killed me, but that I made my
eſcape. I went out of the Cloſet, and a little after out of the Palace, being
ſtayed by no man, becauſe I was reaſonably well belov'd: nevertheleſſe
ſeeing there was no ſafe abiding for me in <hi>Mitylene,</hi> I went aboord my ſhip,
with all my ſouldiers, who were ſoone come about me; and I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
in full Sea about the Iſle, being not able to goe farre away: but in the
end impatient to know what was arriv'd to the Princeſſe, I landed one of
my men, for to goe learne newes of her: he made report to mee that ſhee
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7768:109"/>
was kept priſoner, but in a very ſtrange faſhion. The King after he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
all the anger an offended father might make ſhew of, deliberated to
hold her in ſure guard: yet for the execution of that purpoſe, he was much
troubled, becauſe ſhee was ſo generally beloved, as he knew not of whom
to be confident. But when he had along time conſidered in his minde,
hee advis'd to put her into a Caſtle with a guard of many women that
would be uncapable of reſenting her charmes, who were ſhut up with her,
having proviſion of victualls for more than ſix yeares: then hee ſent for
out of the fartheſt parts of <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> ſix thouſand Barbarians, that were
diſpos'd round about the Caſtle, which was invironed with high walls, in
ſuch ſort as they could not ſee her. This order having beene given, the
Princes that were in love with her, being reſolv'd to ſerve her, and judging
it impoſſible to deliver her, if they were not puiſſantly aſſiſted, departed for
to goe each into his owne countrey, and bring forces from thence that might
give them the honour of her deliverance, and gaine her affection to them:
as they beleev'd I had juſtly poſſeſſed it before, for having ſaved her out of
the hands of <hi>Araxes.</hi> The man I had ſent brought me all this newes: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
I conſult with my ſelfe what I was able to doe, not enduring that any
but my ſelfe ſhould deliver the Princeſſe, who was priſoner for my occaſion.
I call to counſell my companions, and tell them, I was reſolv'd to returne to
the Pyrats, for to bring with me all the forces they had in the Iſland, and
with them to deliver <hi>Paſithea:</hi> that we ought to feine wee had beene long
retained in ſome place; and for our better reception we were to make ſome
more prize. They accorded to what I deſir'd, and then we traverſed the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gean
Sea; and we had coaſted all the <hi>Peloponeſus</hi> finding nothing, untill
here hard by we met a Veſſell of Merchants, amongſt whom was this brave
Greeke (ſaid <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> ſhewing him that had kept <hi>Melintus</hi> from killing
him) to whom, purſues he, I can render no other recompence, for being
cauſe you tooke not away my life, ſaid he to <hi>Melintus,</hi> than by telling you,
that he hath ſeem'd to me the moſt vertuous man I ever knew, as well for
the contempt he made of death, when my companions aſſailed him, as
for the wiſe diſcourſe he hath ſince given us: ſo as in admiring him, I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
him, and prayed him that he would continue my friend: I have
counted to him a part of my adventure, for to take his counſell; and when
we were entertaining one another with much affection, your ſhip appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
which we ſet upon to our loſſe. I vow to you, that nothing ever ſo
amaz'd me, as to ſee you leape into my Brigantine, having never yet beene
aſſaulted in my life; and I have for the preſent no greater deſire than to
know who you are, for to devote my ſelfe to you in quality of a ſouldier, or
ſlave, which you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eurymedon</hi> thus ended his ſtory, and the generous <hi>Melintus</hi> having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
his grace, and the naturall livelineſſe of his diſcourſe, and nothing doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his valour or nobleneſſe, promis'd him not his friendſhip alone, and
that of his company, but their aſſiſtance beſides for the enterprize of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſithea.</hi>
We are, continues hee, <hi>Sicilians,</hi> and are going to <hi>Corinth</hi> for ſuch
a deſigne as yours is: for I have there a faire Miſtreſſe, ſiſter to <hi>Palamede</hi>
you ſee here (ſhewing him) who is injuriouſly retain'd from mee. We are
<pb facs="tcp:7768:109"/>
now ſo neare our journeyes end, that if you will ayd mee for the getting
of her, we ſhall afterwards joyne us to you to goe along to the Iſle of
<hi>Lesbos. Eurymedon</hi> thought himſelfe very happy for finding ſo ſoone an
occaſion to ſerve him; and when they had all embraced to be friends one
to another, <hi>Eurymedon</hi> commanded his men to follow him in their Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantine.
They continued on their way, in conſulting what they had to
doe, and arriv'd by night at <hi>Corinth.</hi>

a troop ſo generous; and lent as much light as was neceſſary to
make them know one another, and not be knowne. Forthwith
<hi>Melintus</hi> came out of the ſhip with <hi>Palamede,</hi> after having
committed the government of what they had reſolv'd on, to
that wiſe Greeke, whom they already made great eſteeme of becauſe of the
prudent advice he had given them in the counſell they held together;
and when they had intreated <hi>Eurymedon</hi> and <hi>Amyntas</hi> to be in a readineſſe
with the ſouldiers, if they had need of their ayd, they entred into <hi>Corinth,</hi>
and went towards the Temple of <hi>Iuno. Palamede</hi> having conducted <hi>Melintus</hi>
thither, made him retire ſeven or eight paces, while he had ſpoken with the
guard of the Temple, and after they had opened, he demanded them, if he
might not ſpeake a word to <hi>Epicharis</hi> from <hi>Sebaſtus</hi> and <hi>Dicearchus.</hi> Theſe
people that had ſeene him before with his uncle, failed not to goe call <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charis,</hi>
who comming forth to ſee who enquir'd after her, was greatly ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to finde <hi>Palamede</hi> there: preſently he brought her where <hi>Melintus</hi> was,
and ſhe was overcome with joy for ſeeing them againe. <hi>Melintus</hi> ask'd her
how <hi>Ariana</hi> did: Very well, anſwered ſhe, if ſhe may but ſee you; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
your ſelfe you never came ſo ſeaſonable, for we are reduc'd to a great
extremity. <hi>Ariana</hi> hath alwayes deferr'd her reſolution to the returne of her
brother, and <hi>Dicearchus</hi> not enduring ſo long delayes, has given her three
dayes onely of reſpite, which expire to morrow; and doe not hope, ſaid
ſhe to <hi>Palamede,</hi> to be able to bend him by any reaſon: for hee is ſo ſetled in
minde to give her <hi>Piſistratus,</hi> that all the powers of heaven and earth could
not make him alter this reſolution. <hi>Melintus</hi> ſtood mute to underſtand ſo
cruell opiniativeneſſe, but <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Epicharis</hi> told him, there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remedy but to carry away <hi>Ariana</hi> to a place where <hi>Dicearchus</hi> had no
power, and where ſhe might diſpoſe of her ſelfe. This very night, continued
<hi>Epicharis,</hi> you are to depart, for to avoyd the violences of to morrow. Can
<hi>Ariana,</hi> ſayes <hi>Melintus,</hi> reſolve her ſelfe upon this flight? You are too reſpectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
anſwered <hi>Epicharis,</hi> and ſhee too vertuous: you muſt for a time diſpenſe
with this ſeverity of wiſdome, and let love and courage worke. Never hope
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7768:110"/>
your vertue ſhould ſubdue <hi>Dicearchus</hi> fury: you muſt oppoſe your paſſion
to his, and yours being the more noble, it will without doubt maſter the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Remember you onely that this nights houres are very precious, and if
you loſe them, peradventure you may never recover them againe. <hi>Melintus</hi>
demanded counſell of them, what he had to doe: and it was a ſtrange thing,
to ſee a perſon ſo ſtored with wiſdome and valour, reduc'd in this occaſion
to implore the counſell and aſſiſtance of a wench, and of <hi>Palamede</hi> too that
ſo many times had needed his prudence, for the redreſſe of his youthfull er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
But yet <hi>Melintus</hi> now miſtruſted his owne vertue that ſlackned, and
was giving way to his paſſion, for to let that have the ordering of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe
which ſeem'd ſomething violent to him; and he asked counſell of
others, thinking he was incapable in that eſtate to counſell himſelfe. <hi>Epicharis</hi>
told him ſhee would goe firſt to advertiſe <hi>Ariana</hi> and <hi>Cyllenia</hi> of their arrive:
and when ſhe had taken advice of them ſhe would returne, and that then
they might reſolve of all things. So ſhe left them, and being entred in againe
went to bring <hi>Ariana</hi> and <hi>Cyllenia</hi> this newes, who attended with much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
to know what <hi>Dicearchus</hi> had to ſay to <hi>Epicharis:</hi> but their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were well changed at the returne of this wench, when they underſtood
how <hi>Melintus</hi> was ſo neare them. It moved <hi>Ariana</hi> extremely, that felt all at
a time, joy, feare, and hope. <hi>Epicharis</hi> and <hi>Cyllenia</hi> confirm'd her, and after
many reaſons alleaged on either ſide, made her reſolve to goe her way with
<hi>Melintus.</hi> That which moſt encourag'd her in this project, was the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<hi>Cyllenia</hi> tooke to goe with her; having had, ſhe ſaid, no proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſince the death of <hi>Lepantus,</hi> beſides that of her friendſhip, which ſhe would
enjoy all her life time, and for this cauſe ſhe would follow her fortune. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
could ſcarce beleeve what ſhe ſaid: but ſhe aſſured her, it was her reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They ſent away <hi>Epicharis</hi> againe to bring <hi>Melintus</hi> to the place they
were in, and thought good to have ſcaling-ladders procur'd, whereby they
might ſave themſelves; becauſe it was impoſſible to have them all goe out by
the gate by reaſon of the guards of the Temple, whom they would not have
killed though that had beene eaſie enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus,</hi> when he knew the reſolution of <hi>Ariana</hi> and <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> intreated <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamede</hi>
to goe backe to the ſhip, to fetch from thence a ladder of cords; and to
bring along with him the ſage Greeke; that <hi>Eurymedon</hi> and <hi>Amyntas</hi> came ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
alſo, with five or ſix ſouldiers in favour of their retreat; and that all
ſhould be conducted to a place of the wall <hi>Epicharis</hi> ſhewed them. <hi>Palamede</hi>
promis'd not to faile in that order, then went his way. <hi>Melintus</hi> let himſelfe
be led all-trembling by <hi>Epicharis,</hi> for to goe ſee his deare <hi>Ariana,</hi> whoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
had beene ſo cruell to him. The gates were ſhut up as ſoone as they were
entred, and <hi>Melintus</hi> was brought to a Chamber, where <hi>Ariana</hi> going out to
meet him, could not refraine from opening her armes to receive her deare
<hi>Melintus,</hi> and ſuddenly being aſham'd for doing that action before <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> ſhe
left him without ſpeaking, to give him leave to ſalute that deare friend of
hers. <hi>Cyllenia</hi> admiring the majeſtuous faſhion of <hi>Melintus,</hi> though hee were
much out of countenance, aſſured him that he was welcome. He anſwered
her, that to have beene receiv'd onely into that Chamber, was a favour too
ſenſible to him for being able to expreſſe the true apprehenſion of it. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſhe made him ſit downe by his faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> which was to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7768:111"/>
for him that could no longer have ſuſtain'd himſelfe in that ſudden ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
he was in. They felt themſelves both ſo moved, that being one before
the other, and holding hands together, they could neither of them ſpeake.
<hi>Melintus</hi> to eaſe his heart which he felt oppreſſed, fetch'd a great ſigh, which
<hi>Ariana</hi> receiv'd as ſhe breathed at the ſame time, and then by ſuſpiring ſhee
ſent it backe againe to <hi>Melintus;</hi> and it ſeemed that their ſoules did thus viſit
one another, or rather that they made uſe but of one ſoule for the animation
of their bodies. In the end <hi>Cyllenia</hi> that nothing wondred at this ſilence for
being ſo well acquainted what love was, would comfort them, and ſaid, that
ſighes would not ſerve the turne to ſave them, and that time muſt not be loſt.
Then <hi>Melintus</hi> began to ſpeake, and addreſſing him to <hi>Ariana,</hi> ſaid to her;
But, Madam, can I beleeve you will follow me? She anſwered; <hi>Melintus,</hi> I
am yours, and without you I cannot live: In what part of the world it ſhall
pleaſe you to retire me, I ſhall account my ſelfe happy there to dye with you.
See there <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> continued ſhe, who will accompany me; and I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not to miſcarry, ſince ſhe will take part in the action. <hi>Cyllenia</hi> told them,
now the reſolution is taken, let us conſider of chuſing out the moſt neceſſary
of our furniture, and be gone. <hi>Epicharis,</hi> that already thought of getting them
together, ſaid they ſhould ſoone be ready. Then <hi>Cyllenia</hi> having taken a
little Cabinet, wherein was what ſhe had moſt precious, put it amongſt the
things <hi>Epicharis</hi> wrapped up together; and every thing being in a readineſſe,
they went out of the Chamber without noyſe-making, and tooke them to the
foot of the wall, where they ſtayed not long, til they ſaw falling at their feet a
ladder of cords. <hi>Melintus</hi> firſt aſcended, &amp; took <hi>Ariana</hi> hy the hand to hold her
up in comming after him, and having drawn her to the top, he gave her to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamede</hi>
who help'd her downe, and <hi>Melintus</hi> went for the two that remain'd,
one after the other. <hi>Cyllenia</hi> would have <hi>Epicharis</hi> goe away firſt, it being more
dangerous ſhe ſhould ſtay behinde than her ſelfe, but yet in the end they were
all three ſaved. Preſently <hi>Melintus</hi> tooke <hi>Ariana</hi> in his armes, and carried her
away as faſt as he could: <hi>Palamede</hi> ſeiz'd on his deare <hi>Epicharis,</hi> and the Greek
tooke <hi>Cyllenia. Eurymedon</hi> and <hi>Amyntas,</hi> with ſome ſouldiers, favoured their
ſlight, but they were amaz'd when they heard a great noyſe in the City, and
many people comming towards them. The egreſſe out of the houſe could not
be ſo ſecret, but that the ſervants ſoone perceived it, and had advertis'd the
guards of the Temple that came running after the raviſhers, and ſome of
them went to <hi>Dicearchus</hi> and <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> to give them advice of this eſcape.
<hi>Eurymedon</hi> and <hi>Amyntas</hi> were conſtrain'd to ſtay thoſe that followed them, by
ſhutting up the paſſe of a ſtreet, while the Ladies might have time to be
tranſported into the ſhip: they would have beene contented to ſuſtain them;
then to make their retreat, but that they ſaw the number increas'd, ſo as they
reſolv'd to kill ſome of them, to ſtrike feare into the reſt. Inſtantly they ſtruck
downe dead five or ſix upon the place, and that cool'd the courage of thoſe
that followed, ſo as it was eaſie for them to make their retreat without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
They entred into a Skiffe that waited to carry them to the veſſell, and
arriv'd at the ſame time the Ladies were brought by <hi>Melintus</hi> and the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the Cabins for to repoſe them: but at their entrance they ſaw a
ſtrange ſpectacle. There were Torches in the ſhip, by meanes whereof <hi>Cyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenia</hi>
ſeeing him that carried her, made a great cry, and violently ſtriving, got
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7768:111"/>
out of his armes: then all affrighted as ſhe was, ſhe ran away towards <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
looking behind her in trembling if he followed her not. On the other
ſide the Greeke that held her, having ſeene her, fell downe the whole length
of him, and gave no more ſigne of life at all. <hi>Ariana</hi> demanded of <hi>Cyllenia</hi> the
cauſe of that great feare, and ſhe ſaid to her, Deare <hi>Ariana,</hi> know that I was
carried away by the ſoule of <hi>Lepantus,</hi> which had re-aſſum'd his body, for to
render me this office, and having put me into the ſhip, it left the ſame body
that is fallen downe dead againe. Preſently they went towards that Corps.
<hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Eurymedon</hi> ſaid it was a Greek they had brought with them, and
that well deſerv'd they ſhould take care of him. Then by vertue of remedies
they brought his pulſe into him againe, then his ſight, and a little after his
ſpeech. Ha gods! ſaid he, what have I ſeene? <hi>Eurymedon</hi> tooke care of
him, and <hi>Melintus</hi> return'd to <hi>Cyllenia</hi> who was all-affrighted, to tell her
that it was not a dead Corps, but a living man. No, no, anſwered ſhe, it was
the ſoule of <hi>Lepantus. Melintus</hi> could not imagine what ſhe meant; but <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
that knew her life, ſaid to her, And may it not be <hi>Lepantus</hi> himſelfe, who
it may be is not dead? On the other ſide, the Greeke ſayes to <hi>Eurymedon,</hi>
Ha! I have ſeene <hi>Cyllenia.</hi> He anſwer'd him, What doe you ſo hate <hi>Cyllenia,</hi>
that you cannot ſee her without ſo much horror and amazement? Alas! 'tis
contrary, replied he, I cannot ſee her, becauſe I have too much lov'd her.
What is't then? reparted <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> doe you flye that you love? In the eſtate
ſhe is in, anſwered he, I cannot ſee her but dye. On the other ſide <hi>Ariana</hi>
ſayes to <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> let us goe ſee if it be <hi>Lepantus.</hi> I will not goe thither, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſhe, for he is dead. But peradventure, replied <hi>Ariana,</hi> he is living. Dead
or alive, ſaid ſhe, I cannot endure ſight of him. Thus they would neither of
them ſee one another: <hi>Lepantus</hi> becauſe he thought her married, and <hi>Cyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenia</hi>
becauſe ſhe thought him dead, and though he had beene alive, becauſe
ſhe had beene ſo unfaithfull to him. At laſt <hi>Ariana</hi> went to ſee <hi>Lepantus,</hi>
and aſſured him that <hi>Cyllenia</hi> was not married; which he would not beleeve;
then ſhe return'd to <hi>Cyllenia</hi> to tell her that <hi>Lepantus</hi> was not dead. Thus were
many voyages to be made, firſt to one, and then another, before they were
able to certifie them; and <hi>Ariana</hi> was conſtrain'd to tell <hi>Lepantus</hi> in what
ſort the marriage of <hi>Cyllenia</hi> with <hi>Callias</hi> had beene broke, and how the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures
ſhe had ſince received were puniſhment enough to her for her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty.
She went againe to tell <hi>Cyllenia</hi> that <hi>Lepantus</hi> had beene preſerv'd
from death, and had alwayes kept his affection as perfect as if ſhee had never
failed in her conſtancy to him, and ſhe prayed her to reſolve to ſee him. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pantus</hi>
and <hi>Cyllenia</hi> were at the laſt brought one before the other; <hi>Cyllenia</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by <hi>Ariana</hi> and <hi>Epicharis;</hi> and <hi>Lepantus</hi> by <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Eurymedon.
Cyllenia</hi> caſt her ſelfe at his feet, and in weeping asked him pardon for her
fault. <hi>Lepantus</hi> put one knee to the ground to be as low as ſhe, and in lifting
her up againe, ſaid to her, that he ſaw for the preſent how the gods had been
nolyars to him, and that in ſaving of his life, they were deſirous to conſerve
to her the faithfulleſt ſervant ſhe could have in the world. After that theſe
two lovers had many times embraced one another, full of aſtoniſhment and
joy, they retired them all into the Chambers; and becauſe it was not ſure for
them to ſtay ſo neare the port, the two veſſels parted, and put into the full
Sea. They conſulted to what place they ought to retire to, not willing to goe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7768:112"/>
to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> whither without faile they ſhould be followed; and becauſe <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
had promis'd to aſſiſt <hi>Eurymedon</hi> for the enterpriſe of <hi>Paſithea,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to goe deſcend to a Port of <hi>Epirus,</hi> where they might attend him while
he went to <hi>Corcyra</hi> to get his forces together, and that in the meane time <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
ſhould marry <hi>Ariana,</hi> and <hi>Lepantus Cyllenia.</hi> Taking this courſe they
ſaw paſſe by a veſſell well armed that went to <hi>Corinth:</hi> but conſidering of
nothing but their joyes, they prayed the winds to be favourable to them, and
went with full Sailes. The weather was very faire, and <hi>Melintus</hi> taking <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
by the hand, led her out to goe walke upon the hatches, where having a
good while entertained her, (and <hi>Palamede</hi> comming on the ſudden that had
ſomething to ſay to his ſiſter,) hee ſet himſelfe in the meane time to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
without ever quitting her hand, and in a ſhort time made theſe
Verſes:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>YE happy waves that beare the beauty I adore,</l>
                  <l>Which made the earth to feele her Empire rigorous;</l>
                  <l>Reſpect you her rule too, and be commanded o're,</l>
                  <l>This veſſell gently court with kiſſes amorous:</l>
                  <l>Vnfaithfull Element, know that at leaſt 'tis ſhe</l>
                  <l>Thou ow'ſt thy loyalty.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>What! doe you murmure waves? and foame your ſelves to rage,</l>
                  <l>To feele you are o're-rul'd by ſo triumphant power?</l>
                  <l>Rebels be quiet, and your ſtormes ſee you aſſwage:</l>
                  <l>If you had eyes to ſee, you would not be ſo ſowre;</l>
                  <l>For ſoone of her regards the lovely violence</l>
                  <l>Would ſtill your inſolence.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But you are yet more fierce, and beyond cuſtome wroth,</l>
                  <l>Preſsing too neare to looke on this Divinity.</l>
                  <l>No <hi>Venus</hi> you have here, no daughter of your froth,</l>
                  <l>She you are bold to ſee has farre more majeſty;</l>
                  <l>And that pure ſhamefaſtneſſe that ſhines upon her face,</l>
                  <l>Shewes that ſhe has more grace.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Yet unto us incline you to be favourable,</l>
                  <l>Vaſt Seas, and ſafely guide this Veſſell to the Port:</l>
                  <l>But if we be purſued, then ope as you are able,</l>
                  <l>For them your deepeſt gulphs that unto death reſort.</l>
                  <l>To your waters I commit this ſtollen jewell,</l>
                  <l>To loſe it be not cruell.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lepantus</hi> that was come upon the hatches too with <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> and the reſt,
heard <hi>Melintus</hi> repeat thoſe verſes he had newly made. And at the ſame time
he compoſed ſome in emulation, and made an air of them: then having found
a Harp, he accorded his voyce to it, and ſung theſe Verſes:</p>
               <lg>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:7768:112"/>
                  <l>Soule, be no more to torments ſo ſubjected:</l>
                  <l>Heart quit vexation, and to joyes aſpire:</l>
                  <l>I ſee my fortune paſſes my deſire.</l>
                  <l>Where I ſought death, I finde my life protected.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>In place where deadly envy I ſuſpected,</l>
                  <l>And happy Spouſe's armes her to combine,</l>
                  <l>Without all thought I tooke her into mine;</l>
                  <l>Where I ſought death, I finde my life protected.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>When my ſad griefes by fury were directed,</l>
                  <l>I ſought to dye, but Seas could not me drownd:</l>
                  <l>Where I ne're ſought, my fortune there I found:</l>
                  <l>Where I ſought death, I finde my life protected.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>After that <hi>Lepantus</hi> had made an end of ſinging, and they had much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his voyce, and the grace he had in touching the Lute; they prayed him
to tell how he had beene ſav'd from the Sea, and what his life had beene
ſince; for <hi>Ariana</hi> had already related part of that which hapned to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
He was very willing to give them this contentment, and ſeeing every
one ſet and prepar'd to liſten, he quitted the Lute to put himſelfe in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of them, and began thus:</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Continuation of Lepantus Hiſtory.</head>
                  <p>TO avoyd the reproaches I might ſeeme to put upon <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> I will make
no repetition of the reſentments I had, to ſee that I was by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
abandoned of her: yet I ſhall onely let you know how I flattered my ſelfe
with a beleefe, that ſhe would prove to what extremity of griefe my fidelity
might reſiſt. For I could not imagine that her ſpirit that ſeem'd to me ſo rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
above the ordinary of women, and had honoured mee with ſo perfect a
confidence, could forget that eſtate we were in together, and draw a veile
before what had paſſed betweene us, to loſe the remembrance of it for ever:
but in the end I learn'd, how to make <hi>Callias</hi> happy, ſhee had ſigned the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of my death. Untill then I thought all her coldneſſes to mee were but
feinings; and even when I underſtood my miſery, I could ſcarce beleeve it,
my minde being unable to be ſo ſoone diſ-abuſed: it may be too I did beleeve
it, ſeeing no cauſe at all of doubting, but that my ſoule aſtoniſh'd at ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
a blow, was then in a dizzineſſe that hindred ſo ſoone an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of its miſery. I was at laſt forc'd to confeſſe ſo viſible a truth, and to be
ſenſible of thoſe ſtings of ſorrow that accompanied ſo cruell an accident. Not
knowing what to doe with my ſelfe, I went into a Boat, and fled away to
<hi>Naupactum,</hi> beleeving to eaſe my miſery by avoyding the dwelling with thoſe
that were cauſe of it: but I was to have the power to eſcape from my ſelfe
too, that was then my cruelleſt enemy; my minde producing continually
furious imaginations for to teare it ſelfe in peeces. I was not content to ſee
my ſelfe in ſo miſerable eſtate, but ſtill to augment my fury and deſpaire, I
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7768:113"/>
ſent backe one of my ſervants to <hi>Corinth</hi> in the ſame Squiffe, for to goe to the
Temple where <hi>Cyllenia</hi> was to be married, and bring me newes after what
ſort ſhe would governe her ſelfe in that action. I expected that newes with
as much unquietneſſe, as if I had hoped for the greateſt pleaſure of my life by
it: but when he was return'd, and I knew that after ſhee had given me my
death, ſhe added blowes that ſeem'd to come from an extreme inhumanity, as
to deſire to know what I had done, after hearing ſhe was married; my ſoule
could not endure this anguiſh, it chaſed away my reaſon, and receiv'd in place
of it, deſperation; which getting the maſtery, ordain'd me to ſay to the man
that ſpake to me; Goe, and faile not to tell her what thou art about to know:
and ſuddenly I gained the height of a great rocke, that avances into the Sea,
and caſt my ſelfe downe in his preſence.</p>
                  <p>But who can doubt (after what I ſhall tell you) of the continuall care the
gods have over us? for it is impoſſible to attribute to fortune, that is blinde,
and imprudent, many aſſiſtances we receive in the greateſt hazards of our life,
which cannot be given but from a better, and a more adviſed hand. In ſtead
of loſing my ſelfe, I fell, as I may now ſay, happily, into a great Fiſhers net,
who were with their Boats under that ſame rocke. My fall was ſo ſudden
before the eyes of theſe men, that I was at the bottome of the water before
they could judge what it was; and they thinking it was ſome monſtrous fiſh
that had thus leap'd out of the water and then fallen in againe, drew up their
net with great expectation and hope. When I came to appeare, they could
not yet know what it was, becauſe I was intangled with the net, and ſtore of
weeds that involved me: but at laſt when they had diſ-intricated all with
much carefulneſſe, they found to their great griefe that it was a man. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
their hope was turned into pitty, and after they had made me voyd
the water I had drunke, they ſpread me upon their cloaks, and labour'd very
carefully by all wayes to make me come againe. I opened at length my eyes,
and when I knew the place I was in, I was much amaz'd, yet after I had
learn'd in what manner I was preſerv'd from death, and a long time ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon ſo ſtrange an accident, I knew that the gods were not willing I
ſhould dye. That conſideration affected me with piety and feare all at once,
and brought me to underſtand what fault I had committed againſt them,
when I followed the blind tranſports of my deſpaire. This gave me the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to live, but not to comfort me; and I intreated theſe people to carry me
in their Boats to ſome remote place, where I would reward them for their
paines. They ſet up then a little ſayle, and becauſe the wind was good to goe
to <hi>Cyrrha,</hi> which is a Towne of <hi>Phocide</hi> ſomething neare that place, we arrived
there preſently. I found that they had taken away nothing that was about
me, ſo I had enough to content them with. I had beſides remaining ſome
Diamonds, which now were happily at hand, wherewith I beleev'd I might
make a voyage: in ſuch ſort as I tooke upon me to goe on, not yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in what part I ſhould chuſe my abiding, and having no other purpoſe than
to flye the circuits of <hi>Corynth.</hi> But yet I could finde no corner of the earth
where to live without ſorrow, &amp; I had bin very happy if in any place I could
have loſt my love and my remembrance. My fidelity had too profound a
rooting to be ſhaken, and inconſtancy was not acceptable to me, but in the
continuall change of places, that gave ſome diverſion to my unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.
<pb facs="tcp:7768:113"/>
I wander'd thus over all <hi>Greece,</hi> avoyding thoſe places I had any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
in; and for that reaſon I would not ſee <hi>Athens,</hi> which is a Towne
that might have much diverted my griefe, becauſe of <hi>Eriphile</hi> my deare ſiſter,
who is married to one of the beſt men of this great City. What, interrupted
<hi>Melintus,</hi> are you brother to the vertuous <hi>Eriphile,</hi> wife of <hi>Ephialtes?</hi> Yes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Lepantus.</hi> Give me leave, continued <hi>Melintus,</hi> to embrace you then,
ſince you are brother to one of the wiſeſt women I ever knew, at whoſe houſe
I was a long time brought up, and to whom I have a thouſand ſenſible obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.
Then they expreſs'd a great deale of kindneſſe one to another, and
<hi>Palamede</hi> that had ſhared in the friendſhip of the ſage <hi>Eriphile,</hi> would alſo min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
himſelfe with their embracements. Afterwards <hi>Melintus</hi> referring to ſome
other time to tell him all the cauſes he had to love and ſerve him for his ſiſters
ſake, prayed him to continue his ſtory. <hi>Lepantus</hi> went on: In the end I reſolv'd
with my ſelfe to depart from <hi>Greece,</hi> and to paſſe into <hi>Aſia.</hi> I arriv'd in <hi>Eolida,</hi>
from thence I went into <hi>Lydia</hi> and <hi>Phrygia,</hi> but there befell me no remarkable
thing but in <hi>Galatia,</hi> where I ran a great hazard of periſhing by an infamous
death.</p>
                  <p>As I was comming neere to arrive at the principall City, I paſſed by a wood
where ſome murther had beene committed. I ſaw my ſelfe incompaſſed with
a number of horſemen, who tooke me for one of the murtherers, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me away to the City, what innocency ſoever I was able to alleage. They
that did the murther were preſently after apprehended and put in priſon with
me, and when they knew that I was accuſed of their crime, they mocked at
me among themſelves, and ſwore they would not diſcharge me though they
knew me not, that I might die with them for company. I was much perplexed
having no meanes to juſtifie me but by them, and in great diſpleaſure that I
was to dye ſo ſhamefully, as a way-robber and a murtherer. One day when
I thought they came for us to be led to puniſhment, I ſaw comming in an
Officer of Juſtice, who having aſſembled all the Criminals, declar'd to them
that each was to chooſe his advocate, for to plead his cauſe before the King;
to the end that the moſt eloquent of all ſhould beare away for his Client the
grace that was yeerely accorded. I enquir'd what that grace was, and learn'd
that in <hi>Iulius Caeſar's</hi> time, <hi>Dejotarus</hi> was King of <hi>Galatia,</hi> who after he had
followed the party of <hi>Pompeius,</hi> and beene received into favour by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was
accuſed for having dreſſed Ambuſcado's for him, when he was at his houſe in
<hi>Galatia.</hi> For that cauſe he was cited to <hi>Rome,</hi> where making his appearance,
he was ready to be condemn'd to dye by <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the Senate, but for the
ſuccours of <hi>Cicero's</hi> marvellous eloquence, which had ſo much force as to
make <hi>Caeſar</hi> change his determination, and pardon <hi>Dejotarus.</hi> The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
return'd to <hi>Galatia,</hi> that he might remember this benefit receiv'd by elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
ordained that every yeare on a certaine day, the Criminall perſons
ſhould make choyce of Advocates, amongſt whom he that ſhould be judg'd
the moſt eloquent ſhould carry away for his Client the grace of his life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the advocates prize, to whom was given a Crowne of great value. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had learn'd this, I knew that the moſt famous advocates were retained
of a long time by great ſummes of money, and I ſaw it would be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
for me to hope for that grace, having no meanes, nor any acquaintance in
the Country. Nevertheleſſe I tooke heart, and ſaid all aloud to this Officer,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7768:114"/>
that I demanded leave to defend my ſelfe. Every one tooke him to laughter
to heare my propoſition, for they ſaw me in an eſtate too miſerable, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
I could have any ſcience: but for all that I gave in my name, to the end
I might be heard before the King as well as the reſt. In eight dayes ſpace
that were given to prepare the Orations that ſhould be made, I had leiſure
enough to thinke of mine: and when the time was come, they brought us
all to the Palace. We were put into a great Hall round about certaine barres,
that hindred any approaching to the King, who was within upon a ſeat rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with foure or five ſteps, and had on each ſide of him his chiefe Officers
that were the Judges. When they would begin to heare the pleadings, the
barres were open'd to let in the firſt Advocate that was to ſpeake, who ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
before the King, began a very ſtudied ſpeech, wherein hee labour'd to
defend a criminall that was preſent with us. When he had ended, there roſe
a little noyſe of the different judgements were made of him: then they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to another, who diſcours'd with a great deale of vehemence; and ſo
many were heard one after another. I was in a wonder to ſee ſo many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates,
but they told me there were come of them from all parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
and out of <hi>Greece</hi> too, ſome ſought to by the Criminals, and others invited by
the ambition of making their knowledge appeare, and carrying the prize.
This number troubled me much, yet order was taken that the ſpeeches ſhould
be ſhort, for elſe one day had not beene ſufficient to heare all that preſented
themſelves. At laſt, they ſaid there were no more Advocates to plead. The
King was now demanding the Judges advice, and I thought to have ſtep'd
forward, to intreat audience, but an Herald prevented me, that told the King
there remain'd no more but a poore Criminall called <hi>Lepantus,</hi> who deſir'd to
defend himſelfe. Well then, anſwered the King, wee will not deny him that
juſtice. Then I entred within the barre, and being before the King, I ſaid in
a few words what I had premeditated, with all the aſſurance and modeſty I
could. Brave <hi>Lepantus,</hi> interrupted <hi>Melintus,</hi> doe not deprive us I pray you
the repetition of that Oration; we have time enough to heare it, and ſince it
is but ſhort, it cannot be grievous to you. Grant this at leaſt to the deſire of
<hi>Cyllenia,</hi> who ſo attentively hearkens to the accidents of your life during her
owne vexations. 'Tis to command me, anſwer'd <hi>Lepantus,</hi> ſo to intreat,
and ſince you will have it ſo, I will recite what I ſpake then; I began thus:</p>
                  <p>GReat King, and you equitable Iudges, I cannot complaine of fortune, for the
ſtrange accident I am fallen into, ſince ſhe gives me the happineſſe to be heard
of you: And wherefore ſhould I be aggriev'd at her? ſince both before and after my
calamity, ſhe provided me meanes to releeve my ſelfe? As ſoone as I entred this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
ſhe hath rendred me criminall before I was culpable; but at ſuch a time when a
grace is offer'd which ſhe puts me in hope to obtaine, having made me to be inſtructed
from my infancy in all ſorts of Sciences and Arts, foreſeeing the need I ſhould have
of their aſsiſtance. The gods beſide had beene unjuſt and cruell to permit the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is arri'vd to me, if they had not knowne in what ſort I could ſecure my ſelfe. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
me not of preſumption for being aſſured to carry away this day the prize is given
to the moſt eloquent: it's impoſſible you ſhould refuſe me it, ſeeing there is nothing
can better perſwade than innocence.</p>
                  <p>All that the Art of Eloquence can doe for to palliate a crime, is to breed a doubt to
<pb facs="tcp:7768:114"/>
take away the knowledge of the accuſation, whether it be true or falſe; then it labours
to move compaſſion in the Iudges, to make them incline towards the better part: but
truth hath no need of artifice or diſguiſement; ſhe diſcovers her all naked, and then
produces out of her ſelfe an infinity of powerfull and invincible proofes. This is that
truth that comes to my defenſe, and goes ſo pure out of my mouth, as you ſhall have no
trouble to acknowledge it.</p>
                  <p>No crime it was, moſt juſt King, that made me depart my owne Countrey: neither
by any crime have I entred into this. One misfortune drove me from the land of my
birth, and another have I met with, in your kingdome. The firſt loſt mee the deareſt
of my hopes, and the other will violently take from me the onely things are left mee,
which are honour and life. As for my life, I would abandon it willingly as the moſt
unfortunate of the world; 'tis not the feare of loſing it that makes mee ſpeake before
you. I endevoured to forſake that when it ſeem'd honourable for me to dye: but ſince
the crime they accuſe me of is ſhamefull, and the puniſhment that threatens it; this
occaſion hath faſt bound my life unto my honour, and I am obliged to defend the one,
for to preſerve the other.</p>
                  <p>Since I left <hi>Greece,</hi> I wandred from province to province to give eaſe to an anguiſh
that afflicts me, and paſsing by a wood to arrive at this City, I perceiv'd that I was
environed with perſons that tooke hold of me, without telling me for what cauſe: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I knew there had beene a man ſlaine in that ſame place, and how the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
were brought to the ſame priſon with mee, who knowing that I was accus'd of
their crime, mocked at me when they ſaw me, and ſware they would not declare mee
innocent.</p>
                  <p>But it is eaſie to verifie whether I be guilty or no. Let them be interrogated apart
in what ſort they know me, and it will appeare that I never ſaw them before. It is but
a moneth ſince I paſſed into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and in that time I traverſed <hi>Eolida, Lydia,</hi> and
<hi>Troas:</hi> I was but two dayes within <hi>Galatia,</hi> and the day I was taken, I had come
from a place ſo remote from hence, that it was impoſsible for me to have any acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with them. All this may be knowne of thoſe whom I lodged with in my voyages,
who will not deny to witneſſe to that I ſay.</p>
                  <p>See there, great King, and you the Iudges, all the eloquence I will ſerve my ſelfe
of: The truth it is that ſpeakes out of my mouth: Shee will have you give her the
victory of this dayes worke, it's ſhe pretends the prize, and not I: ſhe ſhewes her
ſelfe to you all naked, for to ſhew you, that the others eloquence, in compariſon of
her, is but an adulterate beauty. Iuſtice, that is ſeated by your ſides, holds out her
armes to her, and from under her head-band failes not to know her perfectly. This
ſevere goddeſſe is without doubt for the preſent well ſatisfied, that the gods have put
amongst the accuſed an innocent, for feare ſhe ſhould this day have beene conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to let goe an offender. Great King, take pitty of a ſtranger, that has no ſupport
with you beſides this juſtice: but this ſtay is very powerfull, ſine 'tis that alone that
can maintaine kingdomes. I feare not death, but infamy. If I cannot deſerve the
prize of eloquence from ſo many rare wits, ordaine me at leaſt from this preſent to goe
employ my life in the defenſe of your frontiers against the <hi>Barbarians:</hi> I ſhall eſteeme
my ſelfe happy to dye like a man of courage. If I cannot avoyd death, at leaſtwiſe let
me avoyd ſhame: or if you will make this day famous, by the moſt memorable judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that ever was, let none of us all beare away the victory; but give in my favour
the prize of eloquence to truth, and life to innocence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:7768:115"/>
I made an end thus with ſome kinde of hope, becauſe I was heard with
much attention. Preſently the King roſe up, and after taking the opinions of
all the Judges, he ſate him downe in his ſeat againe; then hee pronounc'd;
The Greeke <hi>Lepantus</hi> is declared by our judgement innocent and victorious.
By and by they came for me from among the criminals with whom I had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
me againe; and making me approach to the Throne where the King was,
I put one knee upon one of the ſteps, and received from his hand the crowne
ordained for the victor. The King was not contented with this grace, which
he had given to my innocence rather than my eloquence; but lifting up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
he tooke me by the arme, and commanded me to accompany him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he would know what I was. He did me the favour to leane on mee till
we came to his chamber, where having enquir'd of me all he had a minde to,
I ſatisfied him with the moſt reſpect I could; then he offered me one of the
chiefe places of his judicature, if I would ſtay with him. I anſwered him,
that being redeuable to him for ſo many graces, hee might diſpoſe of the life
he had given me: but that finding me uncapable to governe my ſelfe, it would
be impoſſible for me to governe his people that were under his authority.
That if he would adde an extreme favour to ſo many others, I beſought him
would give me leave to returne into my owne Countrey. He labour'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
me ſtill by ſome reaſons, but ſeeing that if I would have yeelded to him,
it was for not daring to contradict him; and that my deſire was altogether
bent to depart his Realme, he made me ſome preſents, and let me goe. I put
my ſelfe into ſome equipage for my returne, and providing me of men and
horſes for not running any more ſuch ſhamefull fortune, I re-paſſed by the
ſame wayes I came; then I croſſed the Egean Sea, and deſcended into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi>
where having ſtayed ſome time, I went into <hi>Epire,</hi> whither we are now
going. But becauſe vexations were my moſt agreeable company, I began to
be weary of my men, and reſolved to goe live in ſome ſolitude. According
to this project I left them in <hi>Epire,</hi> with charge to attend mee there, untill I
had made a voyage into <hi>Italy.</hi> I paſſed the Sea without any of my people,
and arriv'd at <hi>Brunduſium:</hi> I traverſed <hi>Apulia,</hi> never meeting with any place
I could delight in; from thence I came to <hi>Cumae,</hi> where having found a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to be alone in as much as I would, I tooke ſome ſmall proviſion to eat,
which I carried in with me; and there I accuſed the gods as much as I plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
I tormented my ſelfe according to my humour with cruell remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances:
and the more paine I inflicted on my ſelfe, the more ſatisfaction I
imagin'd to receive. That place was the den of the <hi>Cumean Sybil,</hi> and one
night when I had made a thouſand complaints, I bethought my ſelfe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
the ſuccours of her voyce, which as they ſaid was ſtill remaining in the
world, for to favour me with an Oracle. This ſacred <hi>Sybil</hi> at laſt had pitty of
my evils, and I heard the divine voyce ſpeake to me in theſe verſes:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Lover of Conſtancy undaunted,</l>
                     <l>Thou ſhalt perceive thy griefes decay,</l>
                     <l>If thou return'ſt without delay</l>
                     <l>Where to thee thy birth was granted.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Epicharis, Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> interrupted this diſcourſe, by taking them
<pb facs="tcp:7768:115"/>
to laugh, and ſaid all at once, Was it you then, <hi>Lepantus,</hi> we gave that ſame
Oracle to? Looke you, continued <hi>Melintus</hi> in ſhewing <hi>Epicharis,</hi> there's your
<hi>Sybil</hi> that pronounc'd the verſes, and I it was that made them on the place.
<hi>Lepantus</hi> was ſo amaz'd that he knew not what to ſay, having beleev'd untill
then that he had beene divinely aſſiſted; whereupon being all confounded,
<hi>Cyllenia, Eurymedon,</hi> and the reſt that knew nothing of that incounter, prayed
<hi>Epicharis</hi> to tell them what it was. She recounted to them, how being eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
they three out of the priſons of <hi>Rome,</hi> and flying that City, they hid
them one night within this den, where hearing a man that complained to
himſelfe, and implor'd the ayd of the <hi>Sybils</hi> voyce, ſhe reſolv'd to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet
that voyce, and to ſend backe this wofull man to his owne kindred. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pantus</hi>
returning out of his aſtoniſhment, ſaid to her; Faire <hi>Epicharis,</hi> is it
poſſible, this you ſay? 'Tis even ſo, anſwered ſhe, and beſide I call you well
to my remembrance, becauſe now I know 'twas you that paſſed by us the
next day morning. 'Tis true, ſaid <hi>Lepantus,</hi> that I ſaw ſome body that would
have ſtayed me; but I was ſo ſatisfied with my Oracle, and the gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
that nothing was capable of holding me. In the meane time, ſaid <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picharis,</hi>
ſee how beyond all thought I have prov'd true: for you have found
here by my meanes, your fortune entirely changed; and to me you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
for all your proſperity. 'Tis true, replied <hi>Lepantus,</hi> that you are my
<hi>Sybil,</hi> and the ſole goddeſſe I am bound to adore; ſince of you alone I hold
all the contentments of my life; and had it not beene for you, I ſhould ſtill
be within that grot. Everyone admired this rencounter, and how caſually
they had repair'd to that ſame place, and beene inſpired to render him the
Oracle that was the trueſt, and the moſt wholeſome the gods themſelves had
beene able to have given him. <hi>Lepantus</hi> gave many thanks to <hi>Epicharis,</hi> and to
the gods which had ſpoken to him by her mouth. The he went on:</p>
                  <p>Although I beleev'd the gods tooke care of me, and would deliver me out
of that miſerable life I was in, yet I could not imagine for all that they were
able to heale me otherwiſe than by the forgetting of my love: in ſuch ſort
that albeit I followed the command of that Oracle, it was without all hope of
good fortune, becauſe I would not be cured on that faſhion. I tooke the way
of my Country with languiſh and diſdaine enough, finding my ſelfe forced to
goe thither by a power that ſeem'd fearefull to me, and yet abhorring the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
places I ſought. That cauſed me to make no very great haſte for avancing
my way, and being arriv'd at <hi>Rheggium</hi> after many dayes, I was well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to find no ſhipping there to goe to <hi>Corinth,</hi> becauſe the more I drew neare
it, the more feare had I to arrive. At <hi>Rheggium</hi> I had an hoſt, a very ancient
friend of my deceaſed father, whom I reſolv'd to goe ſee, never thinking
he could have any knowledge of my miſeries; to the end I might ſo journe
ſome time in that place. This good man that was called <hi>Menander,</hi> having
knowne of me who I was, made as much of me as was poſſible; and knowing
that I ſtayed at <hi>Rheggium</hi> but whileſt ſome veſſell parted for <hi>Corinth,</hi> he prayed
me to dwell with him as long time as I pleaſed, and expreſs'd to me, that he
could not receive a greater contentment, than to ſee the ſonne of his good
friend. I was in this houſe a long time, becauſe they were not weary of
me, and I thought not of going away, not yet being able to reſolve of any
thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:7768:116"/>
                     <hi>Menander</hi> knew very well my minde was troubled, and having many times
labour'd to know the cauſe of it, he could never learne any thing, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not willing to preſſe me any further, he onely tried to divert me. He had
a daughter was married at his houſe, nam'd <hi>Melicerta,</hi> that was a very pleaſing
woman, and of a moſt gentile wit, he commanded her not to leave me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
entertainment, and ſhe perform'd the charge with a great care, and more
grace withall. Every day I knew the City newes, which ſhee was well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of; and when the time furniſh'd none of it ſelfe, ſhee related to mee
things that had paſſed before, and ſo agreeably made her recites, that ſhe ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
my mind attentive to her diſcourſe, and gave it no time to conſider of
its melancholy. But ſince we have leiſure enough, I muſt needs impart a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of hers to you, that ſo poſſeſſed me when I heard it from her, and in ſuch
ſort diverted me for ſeeming to concerne my affaires, that I beleeve I ſhall
bring ſome pleaſure to you too by the repetition of it.</p>
                  <p>One day I ſaw come to her houſe a Lady call'd <hi>Ardania,</hi> to viſit her; and
by the kinde entertainments they gave one another, I knew that they were
intire friends. This Lady had much ſparkling: but her beauty ſeem'd to have
encountred ſome great ſickneſſe, becauſe her complexion, though very deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
was pale and decayed, and her eyes that were very full, and of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
bigneſſe, had no quickneſſe in them; and were ſo languiſhing, that they
ſeemed to regret the loſſe of their luſtre and charming vivacity. I perceiv'd
how my preſence made their diſcourſes indifferent, and hindred them from
ſpeaking freely together; ſo as I tooke <hi>Chares</hi> apart (that was <hi>Melicerta's</hi> huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band)
and entertain'd him, for to give them all the liberty I could. I ſaw
well I had done them a pleaſure, for they were more than an houre in ſecret
together; and at length <hi>Ardania</hi> reſolv'd to be gone. <hi>Chares</hi> would wait on
her home, becauſe it was at the lateſt, and left me alone with <hi>Melicerta,</hi> that
ſaid to me a little after; Here was a Lady that has beene a great deale hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer
than ſhe now appeares for: but her griefes have caus'd that change.
I attributed, ſaid I to her, that paleneſſe to ſome ſickneſſe; for there is no
doubt but ſhe ſtill retaines the marks of an extraordinary beauty. I will not
conceale from you, continues <hi>Melicerta,</hi> that for an inconſtant woman ſhe is as
well puniſh'd as could have beene deſired; and when I conſider the accidents
that hapned to three or foure of my acquaintance, I finde that love is very
juſt: when he pretends to be revenged, he adviſes ſometimes to puniſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelities
after a pleaſant manner; and though <hi>Ardania</hi> be my deareſt friend,
I have ſo much confidence in your diſcretion, as not to feare relating to you
the whole ſtory.</p>
                  <p>Three or foure yeeres agoe, went ſhe on, amongſt the moſt accompliſh'd of
of this City, there was one call'd <hi>Polydamas,</hi> who beſides many other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
qualities, had ſo great a diſcretion, that it made him be lov'd of all the
world. He was of kin to <hi>Ardania,</hi> and that conſideration made them ſee one
another often; they had each a very great eſteeme of other: and their affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
giving them ſtill cauſe to love, they were indeared with much affection,
and did communicate together with a great confidence. I was at that time
one that knew all <hi>Ardania's</hi> ſecrets, and I perceiv'd that nothing pleaſed her
like unto <hi>Polydamas,</hi> for ſhe ever made me relations to his advantage, and if
he then made her not in love with him, at the leaſt he made her have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb facs="tcp:7768:116"/>
for all other men. Hee was engaged above two yeares before, in the
ſearch of a Maid nam'd <hi>Eluſina,</hi> who loved him with ſo much conſtancy, that
ſhe ſuffered for his ſake all the cruelties a furious father can inflict, when he
ſees his daughters paſſion contrary to his deſignes. <hi>Ardania</hi> knew of <hi>Polyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
all that paſſed in that affection: but becauſe he was more loved, than he
lov'd himſelfe, he purſued that enterpriſe with coldneſſe enough, and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not the endevours <hi>Eluſina</hi> made to attaine to what they deſir'd: onely
he contented himſelfe to render her ſuch duties, as hee could not deny her
without expreſſion of much forgetfulneſſe and contempt. <hi>Ardania</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
reproach'd him before me for the ſmall care he had of <hi>Eluſina;</hi> and
he confeſſed to her ſelfe that ſhe was cauſe that he could never have a love to
any to be in love with. In the end the conſtancy of <hi>Eluſina</hi> gave way to the
violencies of her father; ſhe reſolv'd with her ſelfe to obey him, and for
this demanded leave of <hi>Polydamas,</hi> that ſhe might be deliver'd from the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
ſhe was made to endure. He did at that time an action that might ſeeme
to proceed from a good ſincere affection; but that was indeed a teſtimony of
his coldneſſe. He wrote to her, that not able to ſee her eternally endure, he
had reſolved to intreat her the ſame thing for which ſhe had deſired leave of
him: that loſing all hope, ſhe ought to give ſatisfaction to her friends, to
preſerve her ſelfe from miſery; that he prayed her to forget him, if it were
poſſible, for not being all her life miſerable; that for this purpoſe he return'd
her all the pledges he had of her friendſhip, and remitted her all the oaths
ſhe had made him; to the end that engagement hindred not her repoſe.
Hereupon ſhe married, and left <hi>Polydamas</hi> at liberty, who but poorely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
this misfortune. <hi>Ardania,</hi> continued <hi>Melicerta,</hi> has a brother call'd
<hi>Miſander,</hi> who, with other baſe qualities, is poſſeſs'd of ſo heavy a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as he is diſtaſtfull to all company. <hi>Lepantus</hi> was there interrupted by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myntas,</hi>
who told him, I have ſufficiently knowne <hi>Miſander</hi> to my coſt. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
added, it may be 'tis the ſame <hi>Miſander Erycine</hi> ſpake of to me. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſame, replied <hi>Amyntas,</hi> whoſe humour made us ſuffer a long time both
of us. I perceive then, went on <hi>Lepantus,</hi> you know him better than I doe by
ſight; but yet peradventure I know more than you the effects of that ſad hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
that vexes himſelfe, and has given ſo much trouble to others. <hi>Polyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
continued <hi>Melicerta,</hi> though he deſpiſed <hi>Miſanders</hi> humour, yet he gave
not over making ſhewes of kindneſſe to him that he might be often with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dania,</hi>
whoſe company he was very well pleas'd with. One day <hi>Miſander</hi>
heard how they ſpake of marrying <hi>Polydamas;</hi> and when they were all three
together, he told this newes to his ſiſter, as if it had beene very agreeable to
them; whereupon <hi>Ardania</hi> bluſh'd. <hi>Polydamas</hi> obſerv'd this action; for there
is nothing ſo ſoone perceived, as that which makes for our advantage, and he
judged that ſhe was intereſſed much in him. That made him thinke of a
thing he was not yet well adviſed in, which was to ſeeke her affection, having
but till then deſired her friendſhip. <hi>Ardania</hi> was farre more handſome than
<hi>Eluſina,</hi> and it was very eaſie to kindle a fire, after the beginning of heat
that was betweene them. There had beene nothing but the conſideration of
their kindred that hindred <hi>Polydamas</hi> from caſting his eyes upon her for to
marry her; but then he knew, that ſince ſhe made no difficulty of it, hee
ought not to be more ſcrupulous than ſhe. See him then reſolv'd to teſtifie
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7768:117"/>
much paſſion to her; and without ſeeming to have apperceiv'd her inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that ſhe might not be aſham'd for having prevented him, he judged
that he was to feine to have lov'd her of a long time with a conceal'd affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Upon that occaſion he made many verſes, whereby hee ſaid it was at
leaſt permitted him to put in writing what hee ſuffered without telling the
ſubject of it, and to comfort his mind in this ſort, for ſo many cruell thoughts
that tormented it, and would breake out. At the ſame time hee was more
carefull than ordinarily in his reſpects to <hi>Ardania,</hi> and expreſſed to her by
his ſighs, and ſome interrupted words, that he dyed for love of her. At the
firſt teſtimony ſhe had of it, ſhe learn'd me the newes that <hi>Polydamas</hi> lov'd
her, as a thing extremely deſired of her, and that poſſeſſed her with joy; I
was then at her houſe, when he ſhewed her thoſe verſes, and ſhee was very
glad to have him read them before me, to the end I might know how much
paſſion he had. He imputed all his coldneſſes for <hi>Eluſina,</hi> to this ſecret love
he had for another a long time ſince, and feined to have done many things
out of neceſſity, which were not done then without deſigne. We ask'd him
many queſtions upon this ſecret love he yet declared not, to all which he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well ſatisfied; and <hi>Ardania</hi> tooke great pleaſure therein. Hee knew very
well we underſtood all he would ſay; and from that time we tooke a cuſtome
of ſpeaking together without declaring of any thing openly; and yet we fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
not to tell all things as intelligibly, as if he had told the name of her he
loved. I found him very happy for treating on this faſhion, becauſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the coverture of the kindred, he tooke ſuch liberties as would not have
beene permitted him, if he had beene declar'd for a lover: as to bring neare
often his mouth to hers, and to hold and kiſſe her hand inceſſantly. Thus was
it that he gave birth to the moſt violent paſſion that ever was, becauſe this
faire Couſin refuſing him not thoſe careſſes, and obliging him with a ſtreight
confidence, he felt himſelfe ſo redeuable towards her, and at the ſame time
ſo touched at her beauty, that he kindled a fire not of a long time to be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.
<hi>Miſander</hi> ſaw not very willingly this great intelligence; yet hee could
not judge then that it were other than a ſimple friendſhip. <hi>Polydamas</hi> ſeeing
that he had need of this melancholicke man, gave him in the meane time all
ſorts of duties; for <hi>Ardania</hi> had but a mother who was very old; and all
the power of the houſe was in the hands of this <hi>Miſander,</hi> who though of a
weake and heavy ſpirit, had yet the authority becauſe of the harſhneſſe of his
diſpoſition which they were afraid to diſpleaſe. <hi>Ardania</hi> and <hi>Polydamas</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
him for the moſt to what they had a minde to by gentleneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
but they feared him, when he ſhould have come to know of their love;
for he had other projects for his ſiſter. One day <hi>Miſander,</hi> whether out of
ſimplicity, or of purpoſe, intreated <hi>Polydamas</hi> to perſwade <hi>Ardania</hi> to a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
ſhe reſiſted. <hi>Polydamas</hi> found himſelfe oblig'd to ſpeake of it to her, and
it chanced to fall out in my preſence. He repreſented to her all the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
that ought to move her for the choyce of that husband, whereto at
the beginning ſhe replied with laughter, as if ſhe thought he did but mocke
her; but he urged her ſo, in ſpeaking ſeriouſly concerning this affaire, in
plot, as I beleeve, to prove her, that at laſt ſhe was angry, and ſaid to him,
that ſhe tooke this ill at his hands, more than at any other. She diſcover'd her
ſelfe thus, and it was the firſt word had eſcaped her, whereby ſhe ſhewed
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7768:117"/>
that ſhe approved his affection. Then he appeaſed her, and would make her
beleeve he had ſo ſpoken to know her thoughts; and to tell them to her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
She feined not to tell <hi>Polydamas</hi> often, that ſhe ſhould be the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
woman of the world, if the reſolution ſhe had proſper'd not: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he knew that he was well lov'd of her, yet he knew it not then ſo well
as I did, to whom <hi>Ardania</hi> told a thouſand things touching his affection, that
made me ſee, never woman was more in love.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards there was preſented a party to her, which gave them many fears
and troubles. The buſineſſe had beene debated amongſt the kindred before
communicating it with <hi>Ardania,</hi> becauſe they would not ſo much as doubt
of her will, in ſuch ſort as all was in a good forwardneſſe, when ſhee learn'd
the newes of it. Conſider her then full of apprehenſions, and all ſhe could
doe, was to repreſent ſome difficulties. She acquainted <hi>Polydamas</hi> with it,
who knew not what remedy to invent; and their affection not daring yet to
breake forth, they were both of them in great paine. One day he came in
to <hi>Ardania's,</hi> when the friends of either party were aſſembled, to remove ſome
difficulties concerning that marriage. <hi>Miſander</hi> came out to meet him, and
<hi>Polydamas</hi> ſignified to him that he would be gone, ſince they were buſie. No,
no, ſaid <hi>Miſander,</hi> you ſhall ſtay if you pleaſe, becauſe you have as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in this affaire, as any one that is here. As little, ſaid <hi>Polydamas</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
then ſuffer'd to be led to the place where they were that debated the
differences. <hi>Ardania</hi> was preſent, as pale as if ſhe had beene ready to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to death: but when ſhee ſaw <hi>Polydamas</hi> enter, ſhee conceiv'd ſome
hope, and tooke a little courage. He was in the eſteeme of ſo great vertue,
and ſo good a judgement, that preſently they propos'd the difficulties to him
for to conſider and judge of them himſelfe. At firſt he pretended that he
would accord all things; having for all that no other deſigne than to breake
this aſſembly; and ſaid that they were to yeeld on either ſide, and that ſmall
reſpects ought not to hinder an affaire of great importance. He inſinuated
himſelfe by this meanes into the credence of both parties; but when they
would precipitate the marriage, he ſaid, that was not reaſonable, and that
that which regarded the whole life deſerv'd to be thought of at more leiſure.
In the end he was ſo skilfull in managing their wits, that he brake this aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and made the reſolution be deferr'd to the next day. <hi>Ardania</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
knew not what to thinke of <hi>Polydamas,</hi> hearing him ſpeake: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he had ſo well brought about his deſigne, ſhe was very wel ſatisfied. Then
being alone with <hi>Miſander</hi> and his mother, he declar'd how they were to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
thoſe that would dazle their eyes by ſo ſudden a reſolution as they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
them to take; that there was ſome great defect conceal'd under it, and
time were neceſſary to finde it out. After he had put theſe ſuſpitions into
them, they made ſo many adjournments, as they gave deſpite to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and at laſt all was broken off, to the great contentment of <hi>Ardania</hi> and
<hi>Polydamas,</hi> who were of opinion that they could not alwayes ſo turne off the
ſtormes that ſhould be preſented, and that it was time for them to declare.
The ſuccours <hi>Polydamas</hi> had given <hi>Ardania</hi> in this laſt occaſion, had ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
her, that ſhe was intirely bound to him, and gave him all the honeſt
aſſurances Love is able to accord. They conſulted of the meanes they were
to uſe, and provided them of perſons that might make her mother conſent.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7768:118"/>
There was but this troubleſome <hi>Miſander,</hi> who was too wild a beaſt to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
governed; ſo as there were but few to be found that could perſwade him.
<hi>Polydamas</hi> that had an empire upon his minde, had beene the onely man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to bring him to any thing he was willing to have him, if he had beene
to ſpeake to him for another, but for to ſerve himſelfe of him, he remain'd
without force. Upon theſe attempts the mother ſickens, and dyes. <hi>Ardania</hi>
after having rendred her the laſt duties, receiv'd no conſolation but from the
faithfull company of her deare <hi>Polydamas,</hi> who beleev'd not that any thing
was able to hinder their good fortune, ſince ſhe was left Miſtreſſe of her ſelfe.
There was made betweene them a renuing of aſſurances; they lived in ſo ſtrict
an union, and had as particular cares for one another, as if they had beene
already married together. Then were preſented more parties for her, ſo as
they reſolved to conclude their affaires, and to make the propoſition of them
to <hi>Miſander,</hi> to whom ſhe had purpoſed to declare her abſolute will, and to
pray him to conſent thereto, if not to paſſe forward. <hi>Polydamas</hi> made choyce
of one of his friends to ſpeake to <hi>Miſander;</hi> and he acquitted himſelfe ſo well,
ſhewing him a thouſand reſpects that ought to oblige him to deſire that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
that if he had been of any judgement, he could not have refuſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to a thing ſo deſired of all. He receiv'd this overture with a great deale of
ſadneſſe; nevertheleſſe he promis'd to ſpeake of it to his ſiſter; but within
his minde he conceiv'd a furious hatred againſt <hi>Polydamas,</hi> in ſtead of the
neare friendſhip was betwixt them; and he beleev'd, as there was much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
for it, that <hi>Polydamas</hi> had not expreſs'd affection to him but for this
deſigne. So, unworthy ſoules faile not to acknowledge their owne defaults,
and the merit of others, through the darkneſſe that encompaſſes them; and
in ſtead of cheriſhing the vertue of thoſe that excell them, they hate and ſhun
them for feare of being over-ruled. <hi>Miſander</hi> being return'd to his houſe,
makes himſelfe ſicke, and refuſes to eat: they aske him what his griefe is, he
is angry, and ſpightfull, hee knowes not to whom to take him for to wreake
his choler on; and his whole project is but to counterfet the mad man and
inraged, in teſtimony of his averſion to his ſiſters deſigne. <hi>Ardania</hi> doubted
that all his tranſports came from the declaration had beene made him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſhe was well advertis'd; and knew not how to ſpeake to him in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
humour. At laſt he tooke him to his bed, and then ſent for his ſiſter to
come to him, and when they were alone, he ſaid to her; Well, ſiſter, I knew
at laſt the cauſe of your coldneſſes, and of all the refuſes you made of the
parties were offered you; I perceiv'd my ſuſpitions were well grounded,
when I could not approve ſuch ſecrecy with <hi>Polydamas.</hi> I know well 'tis from
your advice that he makes you be demanded in marriage: See if it be a thing
you have reſolv'd on: I can no longer hinder your purpoſes, &amp; will ſigne you
what conſent you will have me: but aſſure your ſelfe, that I will not live two
dayes after. Yes, I will dye, and make him dye too, for having mock'd mee
all his life, and abuſed my freedome for to deceive me and you alſo. There
fell in continuation a torrent of enraged words againſt <hi>Polydamas</hi> and <hi>Arda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
and after that his fury had taken ſome reſpite, ſhe told him, that ſhe knew
not why he ſhould be ſo tranſported; that ſhe was ignorant of <hi>Polydamas</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
but that if he had an affection to her, he honour'd her by it; that ſhee
would tell him truly, that if he conſented to it, he ſhould doe her a great
<pb facs="tcp:7768:118"/>
pleaſure, for ſhe could never be happy but with him. I would rather, ſaid he
to her, throw my ſelfe downe headlong, and ſtrike a poynard into your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.
No, no, I ſhall hinder the effect of your fancies well enough, or elſe
bloud ſhall be ſeene ſpilt. <hi>Ardania</hi> perceiving that his tranſport made him
ſpeake ſtrange follies, left him, without expreſſion of any great care ſhe tooke
at his words, and they both paſs'd away a night that gave them but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
I had beene choſen, continued <hi>Melicerta,</hi> by theſe two lovers, to be
their confident during the traverſes which they had foreſeene, and it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for them to ſee one another after that declaration, <hi>Miſander</hi> having
ſhut up all the avenues: ſo as <hi>Polydamas</hi> the next day came to ſee me, to know
what had paſſed. I told him that affaires were much embroyled, and that there
was a rumour in the houſe, that <hi>Miſander</hi> was mad, and <hi>Ardania</hi> reſiſted his
rage the beſt ſhe could.</p>
                  <p>But it was a ſtrange thing, to ſee the ſmall force of <hi>Ardania:</hi> ſhee could not
indure her brothers choler, and ſeeing that he would not eat, ſhe went to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
him not to be angry, and ſhe would doe nothing contrary to his will.
I durſt not tell <hi>Polydamas</hi> of this weakneſſe, ſeeing to what point of ſadneſſe
he was brought, becauſe <hi>Ardania</hi> had not ſpoken with ſo great a reſolution as
he expected. She on the other ſide ſeeing her brother pacified, recover'd her
forces, and expreſs'd affection to <hi>Polydamas: Miſander</hi> then made the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
as before, and conſtrain'd his ſiſter to give way to him. That combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>Ardania's</hi> love and <hi>Miſanders</hi> rage endured a long time, and when this
was cooled, the other had the advantage. In the meane time <hi>Polydamas</hi> ſeeing
no more <hi>Ardania,</hi> that put not in effect what ſhe had promis'd him, was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with many cares and unquietneſſes; and the more facility he ſaw of
executing their deſignes, the more griefe he had to ſee that ſhe could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to deſpiſe her brother. But to come to the infidelities I told you of, ſaid
<hi>Melicerta,</hi> which were puniſhed one by another, I will let paſſe all the ſtrifes
<hi>Ardania</hi> made; then the weakneſſes which made her releaſe, with all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
and reproaches <hi>Polydamas</hi> us'd to her, who yet was ſo diſcreet, as he
never complain'd of her but to her ſelfe and to me. He had beene falſe to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſina</hi>
without her knowing of it, and ſhe too had beene unfaithfull to him, in
abandoning him to deliver her ſelfe from miſery, although ſhee beleev'd that
he ſtill lov'd her. Love, to revenge <hi>Polydamas</hi> on <hi>Eluſina,</hi> made her being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
have her husband in ſuch a contempt, that ſhe feined not to ſeeke to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydamas</hi>
againe who deſpiſed her. Againe, to revenge <hi>Eluſina</hi> on <hi>Polydamas,</hi>
he cauſed <hi>Ardania</hi> to forget the greateſt affection that ever was; and I beleeve
that which made her unfaithfull, was the fidelity of her glaſſe, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
her complexion to her effaced with cares, What now? ſaid ſhe, ſhall I
loſe my beauty that procur'd me ſo many vowes and commendations, to
maintaine my love that brings upon me ſo many miſchiefes? No, no, let us
quit this love, the trouble of my ſoule, and the ruine of my deareſt treaſures;
and forgetting it for ever, let that beauty returne, which for one loſt lover
ſhall gaine me above a thouſand. See her then deliberating to become hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
againe, and for the recovery of her good lookes, quite unwilling to
heare ſpeake of <hi>Polydamas</hi> any more. I wondred with my ſelfe at ſo ſtrange
a change; and when I reproach'd her for her lightneſſe, ſhe had the boldneſſe
to deny to me all ſhe had told me when ſhe lov'd <hi>Polydamas,</hi> even thus farre,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7768:119"/>
as ſhe would have made me beleeve, that ſhee never had any affection at all
to him. At that time a young man call'd <hi>Cyllarus</hi> ſought her; he had loved
<hi>Danaide,</hi> a woman he had beene beholding to for all the civility he knew with
Ladies, for ſhe had taken the paines to inſtruct his youth; whereupon <hi>Cyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larus</hi>
being ingrate, renounc'd her friendſhip, and purſued the affection of
<hi>Ardania.</hi> Love that had already taken vengeance of <hi>Eluſina</hi> and <hi>Polydamos,</hi>
was revenged at one blow of two unfaithfull perſons; joyning in marriage
<hi>Cyllarus</hi> with <hi>Ardania</hi> to puniſh them one by the other. This delicate woman
that thought her charmes ſo puiſſant, could not ſtay that wanderer; who was
no ſooner married, but that he return'd to <hi>Danaide,</hi> and without conſidering
of the diſpleaſures he gave his new wife, ſought by all the wayes he could to
re-enter into her good graces. <hi>Danaide</hi> in revenge of her ſelfe, mocked him
a long time, whereat he receiv'd ſo many ſorrowes, as he could not hide them
before <hi>Ardania.</hi> She on the other ſide ſeeing her ſelfe deſpiſed, began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
her faithfull <hi>Polydamas,</hi> ſhe had forſaken; ſo as being both of them in
bed, they lay off from one another as farre as they could, and ſuſpired each of
them apart, one for <hi>Danaide,</hi> the other for <hi>Polydamas.</hi> But a while ſince, <hi>Cyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larus</hi>
has found the meanes to re-joyne with <hi>Danaide,</hi> and this is that <hi>Ardania</hi>
but now told me, ſaid <hi>Melicerta,</hi> at leaſt ſhe has this opinion, whether it be ſo
indeed, or that her jealouſie makes her beleeve it. Doe but ſee, <hi>Lepantus,</hi> ſaid
ſhe to me, what repoſe <hi>Ardania</hi> can expect for the preſent: for whether her
husband finds himſelfe in grace, or in diſgrace with <hi>Danaide,</hi> ſhe receives by
it the ſame affliction: ſhe deſpaires to ſee him ſigh for her; on the other
ſide ſhe dyes, when <hi>Danaide</hi> makes him happy, and in this I account her moſt
miſerable indeed, that the more ſhe is afflicted, the more ſhe brings her ſelfe
into eſtate never to regaine the affection of <hi>Cyllarus.</hi> At length all thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures
have cauſed the loſſe of that beauty ſhe had ſo much cheriſh'd, and
for which ſhe had forſaken him that had ſo much affection for her. <hi>Polydamas</hi>
meeting her by chance very lately, and ſeeing that faire face ſo alter'd as it
was, made verſes under another name, which he ſent to me; and I aſſure
my ſelfe, <hi>Lepantus,</hi> added <hi>Melicerta,</hi> you will finde them very witty. She tooke
them out of her pocket, and ſhew'd me them; I tooke a copy of them,
which I have now about me. <hi>Lepantus</hi> let <hi>Melintus</hi> ſee it, and the company, and
it was thus:</p>
                  <lg>

                     <l>My eyes are wondring who you are:</l>
                     <l>And is your beauty thus to change inclin'd,</l>

                     <l>Your eyes deprived of their armes,</l>
                     <l>Are now no more ſo dangerous:</l>
                     <l>Their beames ſo lively, now have loſt the art</l>
                     <l>Of penetrating to the heart.</l>
                  </lg>

                     <l>For when you baniſhed that flame</l>
                     <l>Which in your ſpirit had ſuch power,</l>
                     <l>Not without fury forth it came,</l>
                     <l>Your complexion to devoure.</l>
                     <l>That teint though lovely had not force enow</l>
                     <l>For to reſiſt ſo keene a blow.</l>
                  </lg>

                     <l>Your beauty proved faithfull yet,</l>
                     <l>When your heart wanted loyalty,</l>
                     <l>For ſeeing me to dye for it,</l>
                     <l>It rather choſe to dye for me.</l>
                     <l>Her faireſt flower paſſing ſo ſoone away,</l>
                     <l>Was conſtant in her changing day.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Alas! ſaid the ſoule ſo grieved,</l>
                     <l>Beauty will you forſake us quite?</l>
                     <l>To this lover I'm obliged,</l>

                     <l>If you reſolve to change, and make him dye,</l>
                     <l>My change muſt give him remedy.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lepantus</hi> folding up the verſes went on. <hi>Melicerta</hi> thus ended her ſtory,
which I liſtned very attentively to, continually thinking upon <hi>Cyllenia;</hi> whom
for all that I could not wiſh to be puniſhed in like ſort; having alwayes kept
for her ſo deare a remembrance, that very often when my memory preſented
her to my imagination, and let me ſee her as unfaithfull, it ſeemed that I tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
away my ſight, but I had ſorrow to be willing at the ſame time, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to thinke of her. And thus lived I during my griefes, which <hi>Melicerta</hi>
only was able to comfort by her delightfull recites. But at length I conſider'd
how I too long time neglected the good fortune the gods had promis'd me;
ſo I thought of departing; and having found the commodity of a veſſell, I
tooke leave of <hi>Menander, Chares,</hi> and <hi>Melicerta;</hi> and being at Sea, we were
encountred by <hi>Eurymedon.</hi> His companions having kill'd ſome of thoſe were
with us, I attended to receive my death at their hands, and I beleev'd that
that was the alleviation of my miſeries the gods had promis'd me, not able to
imagine any other. And for this cauſe I preſented my ſelfe without armes
with much aſſurance before their ſwords. They were amaz'd to ſee me ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
to dye; and <hi>Eurymedon</hi> who ſaw me in this action, thought it was out
of greatneſſe of courage; ſo as he ſav'd me, and embracing me expreſt that he
would have me be his friend. Afterwards I was preſent when the Pyrats
went to aſſaile the brave <hi>Melintus;</hi> and I was ſo happy as to render <hi>Eurymedon</hi>
what he had lent me, by obtaining of <hi>Melintus</hi> that he would not kill him. In
the end following ſo couragious a troop, I found in my armes my deare <hi>Cyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenia,</hi>
as pure, as faire, and with as much affection for me as ever, and all this
by the ſtrangeſt hazard fortune is able to produce. 'Tis for this I ſhall eſteeme
my ſelfe all my life time redeuable to the faire <hi>Epicharis,</hi> whom I ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
call my <hi>Sybilla;</hi> and though this incounter may be aſcrib'd to fortune, I
beleeve rather that the gods are extremely her friends; who would make me
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:7768:120"/>
happy by her enterpriſe. <hi>Lepantus</hi> ended thus, and every one admiring thoſe
incounters; <hi>Melintus</hi> prayed him that they might ſweare together an eternall
friendſhip, as well becauſe of his vertue, as for that he was brother to the ſage
<hi>Eriphile.</hi> They related then to one another all their lives; and the adventures
all of the company had met with, furniſhed them with entertainment enough
in their voyage untill they came into <hi>Epire,</hi> where they landed. <hi>Eurymedon</hi>
tooke his leave of <hi>Melintus</hi> and the company with many embraces, to goe find
out his Pyrats; and he aſſured them he would paſſe by the ſame place againe,
and ſee them before he went to the Iſle of <hi>Lesbos</hi> with his forces; and that if
he found them not there, and they needed his ſervice, they ſhould heare
newes of him in the Iſle, which was the place of his deareſt deſires. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into his owne ſhip with thoſe companions of his that remain'd; and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,
Ariana,</hi> and all their friends, went unto <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> the chiefe City of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi>
in hope to ſtay there without feare of their enemies, and enjoy all the
contentments they could promiſe themſelves.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ortune that had given theſe lovers ſo many traverſes, now
ſeem'd weary of perſecuting them; and they were reſolved to
give end to their owne paines. <hi>Melintus</hi> was the next day to
marry <hi>Ariana,</hi> and <hi>Lepantus Cyllenia. Palamede</hi> offered himſelfe
to returne to <hi>Corinth</hi> to his uncle, feining to come backe from
his <hi>Athenian</hi> voyage; and by making as though he were ignorant of all that
had hapned, endevour to appeaſe him, and likewiſe <hi>Sebaſtus</hi> for <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> and
ſo to mediate their peace and returne. <hi>Lepantus</hi> had found out his men in this
City, who attended for him in the ſame place where he had left them, when
he parted from <hi>Epire</hi> to paſſe into <hi>Italy.</hi> They were lodged very commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly:
ſo as all of them made choyce of that houſe, for to be the happy place
where ſo many faire and violent deſires ſhould receive an entire ſatisfaction.
<hi>Melintus</hi> was ſo raviſhed to ſee himſelfe in the Evening of taſting ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
that he himſelfe could not meaſure the greatneſſe of his owne joy:
but the more <hi>Ariana</hi> approached the height of her deſires, the more did her
modeſty ſtrive to repreſſe the teſtimonies of her contentment. <hi>Lepantus</hi> and
<hi>Cyllenia</hi> in their ſoules felt no leſſe pleaſure. <hi>Amyntas</hi> promis'd himſelfe that
his good fortune would follow that of <hi>Melintus,</hi> from whom he expected
much ſuccours with <hi>Telephus:</hi> and <hi>Erycine</hi> ought to be ſatisfied with him, for
having ſo well obeyed her when ſhe commanded him to ſerve <hi>Melintus.</hi>
There was but <hi>Palamede,</hi> to whom the love of <hi>Epicharis</hi> gave deſire and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency
enough: but the diſcretion of that wench moderated him, who
knowing that he ſhould commit a great fault to marry her being aſlave, had
forbidden him the hope of it, as long as ſhe continued in that condition. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamede</hi>
notwithſtanding in this occaſion not enduring to ſee ſo many perſons
made happy, and himſelfe ſo farre off enjoying the ſame pleaſures, ſaid to
her, Faire <hi>Epicharis,</hi> how long doe you meane to deferre ſatisfying the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
I have for you? deſire you I ſhould attend an infinite time, and in the
meane ſpace live with you the moſt unfortunate of men? feare not to have
me doe any thing unworthy of me by marrying of you; your merit abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
recompences the default of your liberty; and my uncle cannot refuſe
to give it you, when you ſhall be my wife. What occaſion more favourable
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7768:121"/>
may we hope for? Now all things are here in diſorder, if we commit a fault,
it will eaſily be conſiderable. Can you faile by imitating the actions of <hi>Ariana</hi>
and <hi>Cyllenia?</hi> and muſt my condition, which you judge more exalted than
yours, be the ſole cauſe of making me unhappy? <hi>Palamede,</hi> anſwered <hi>Epicha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
if you could judge how much I eſteeme my ſelfe oblig'd to you for your
affection, I thinke you ſo reaſonable, as you would have cauſe to be ſatisfied
with me: but you ſhall pardon me if I cannot conſent to what you deſire. I
know well the difference of our affections. 'Tis a paſſion ſomething blindiſh
that makes you love me, but 'tis reaſon onely that cauſes me to honour you.
You conſider not well what I am, when you expreſſe ſo much love to me;
and without doubt turne away your thought from a defect that accompanies
me, while you eſteeme me worthy of you: Contrariwiſe the more I open
my eyes to ſee what your worth is, the more cauſe I finde to love you, and
thinke my ſelfe indebted to you. But loving you with reaſon, I love your
honour as much as I doe your perſon; and it would ſhew I had out ſmall
care of that, if I ſhould make my ſelfe happy to the prejudice of it. That
which is fit for the faire <hi>Ariana</hi> and <hi>Melintus</hi> to doe, is not ſo for us; and the
ſame reaſon that permits them to marry againſt the deſire of <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> is
that which ordaines me to continue ſtill a Maid againſt yours. <hi>Palamede,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you to temper your deſires; and aſſure your ſelfe that if the gods are
pleaſed with our affections, they will ſo bring affaires to paſſe, that honor and
fitneſſe ſhall not be ſeparate from our contentments. Thus did this wench,
full of wiſdome and courage, ſtay the tranſports of <hi>Palamedes</hi> affection, who
the farther off he found himſelfe from contenting his deſires, the more he
admir'd the vertue and generoſity of <hi>Epicharis,</hi> and increas'd his paſſion by
them. <hi>Melintus</hi> ſent to have brought out of his ſhip much riches whereof he
was provided, for to make that day as famous and magnifique as he was able,
in a place ſo diſtant from their acquaintance. He made to be taken out thence
many ſumptuous moveables, veſſell of gold and ſilver, and what ever hee
thought neceſſary to make himſelfe ſeeme worthy of <hi>Ariana,</hi> if <hi>Dicearchus</hi>
receiv'd him into grace at <hi>Corinth. Ariana</hi> and <hi>Cyllenia</hi> that ought to have bin
the faireſt ornament of that happy day, failed not to prepare againſt the
morning all that might make their beauty appeare more reſplendent: but
nothing could render their charmes more pleaſing, than the exceſſe of their
contentments, which not able to be contained any longer in their hearts, were
now diſcovering themſelves upon their faces. Every one us'd the greateſt care
he could, not to be without pomp and grace; and at laſt that morning arrives
ſo much deſired of all.</p>
               <p>When all things were ready, and they putting themſelves in the way to goe
to the Temple; they heard Trumpets ſounding in the City. <hi>Ariana</hi> thought
<hi>Melintus</hi> had ſent for them from his ſhip to lead her to the Temple with
more ſolemnity: but he ſtood in amaze at it, and having ſent to know what
it meant, they brought him word, that a publike cry was made, by which
was commanded to all thoſe that were ſubjects of the Empire, to ſeize upon
<hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede, Sicilians,</hi> where-ever they were found, and to ſend
their heads to <hi>Rome;</hi> becauſe they were the enemies of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Rome:</hi> and for the better knowledge of them, they gave all their
markes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7768:121"/>
This cruell newes troubled all their joyes, and filled their ſoules with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
and ſadneſſe. They durſt not now goe abroad for feare of being
knowne; and they could not tell what counſell to take in ſuch an exceſſe of
miſery. When they fled from <hi>Dicearchus</hi> fury, ſee them fallen into a farre
greater miſery, having the <hi>Romans</hi> for enemies, whoſe Empire being of ſo
large an extent, they could not hope to get out of it without being diſcover'd
upon the wayes. They ſhut up their houſe as carefully as they could, ſtaying
till they might thinke upon ſome remedy, though they had but ſmall hope to
find any. <hi>Ariana</hi> fell a crying, to ſee a perſecution ſo cruell againſt her deare
<hi>Melintus</hi> and her brother, <hi>Cyllenia</hi> accompanied her teares out of compaſſion,
the others ſought to encourage the reſolution of theſe faire Ladies againſt
this unhappineſſe: but they that took upon them to comfort others, were no
leſſe afflicted themſelves. <hi>Lepantus</hi> and <hi>Amyntas</hi> offered to go learn what they
ſaid about the Towne: but becauſe they were ſtrangers in that place, they
feared leſt they might give ſome ſuſpition of thoſe that dwelt in the ſame
houſe. All that day paſſed with much ſadneſſe and feare, and the next day alſo,
without inventing of any expedient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epicharis</hi> whoſe wit was full of a thouſand inventions, told them, ſhe ſaw
well that it appertain'd to none but her to ſave their lives, as ſhe had once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done at <hi>Rome:</hi> that ſhe would goe about the Towne to ſee what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and for this cauſe ſhe was to be diſguiſed in a man, that habit being fatall
for their ſafety. Nevertheleſſe that they ſhould not be ſo ſecure in her devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but they might try to finde out other meanes beſides. <hi>Melintus</hi> ſaid, he
could finde no better, than to ſend away ſome to <hi>Corcyra,</hi> to advertiſe <hi>Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medon</hi>
of the danger they were running; that he comming by with his forces
might deliver them. <hi>Amyntas</hi> would goe thither to do them this ſervice, and
becauſe he would not take their ſhip, for feare they might have need of it
themſelves, he went away in a Skiffe towards <hi>Corcyra. Epicharis</hi> on the other
ſide made no matter of cutting her haire once again; &amp; being accommodated
with a mans clothes, and a ſword by her ſide, ſhe went out of the houſe one
morning, with a deſigne to goe gaine the Porter of the City, to let them
out by night. She had miſtruſted the conduct of another in this occaſion:
fearing he might cauſe a ſuſpition, and being apprehended diſcover them:
but ſhe was aſſured of the dexterity of her wit, and made no doubt of her
courage in caſe ſhe were taken, never to tell where they were. Her project
happily ſucceeded; for after having ſounded this Porter every way, ſhee
found him to be a man that for a little money would let the very enemy enter
into the Towne. She put ſome peeces of gold into his hand, and prayed him
to attend them about midnight: from thence ſhe went to their veſſell, for
to give order that all might be in a readineſſe at the ſame houre, to the end
they failed not of departing away. But when ſhe was at the Port, there was
a young man that cryed out as he ſaw her; See there my fugitive ſlave,
friends, lend me your helpe to arreſt him. Inſtantly he would have laid hold
on her, but <hi>Epicharis</hi> ſtepping apace backward, tooke her ſword in her hand
and ſtruck him a blow with it upon the arme. Yet ſhe preſently was arreſted,
and brought before the <hi>Romans</hi> that were newly arrived. That young man
having his arme all bloudy, failed not to come to the ſame place, and entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>Romans</hi> they would not let goe his ſlave that was called <hi>Eurylas,</hi> but
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7768:122"/>
that he might be reſtor'd to him againe. Then <hi>Epicharis</hi> knew it was the
Goalers ſonne of <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom ſhe had ſold her ſelfe heretofore: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any amazement, ſhe addreſſed her to the man that ſeem'd to have the moſt
authority, and ſaid to him; I make you Judge of the difference that may be
betwixt this man and me; and I am aſſur'd he will condemne himſelfe; then
ſhe turn'd her towards him, and ſaid, I confeſſe I ſold my ſelfe to you; but
was it not upon condition that I might be redeem'd at the ſame price? 'Tis
true, anſwers he: ſhe goes on; When you would have given me the money
we were agreed for, did I not leave it with you to keepe for me? 'Tis true,
ſaid he againe. Then I might, continues ſhe, lawfully goe away from you
when I thought good, ſince you have the ſame price in your hands, I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
my ſelfe with. The young man ſtood without any anſwer; and he
before whom this cauſe was pleaded, ſaid that <hi>Eurylas</hi> had reaſon, and might
goe at libertie. <hi>Epicharis</hi> made a legge, and tooke her leave of them: but this
young man comming out of his amazement, cryed out; Let him not goe,
for it was he that help'd out of our priſons <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede.</hi> So they
ſeiz'd the ſecond time upon the poore <hi>Epicharis</hi> that was going her way; and
ſhe was brought backe againe before him that had judg'd her, who was call'd
<hi>Trebatius.</hi> There was with him a young <hi>Roman,</hi> whoſe face appear'd very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate,
that ſaid, Without doubt he will learne us newes of thoſe wee ſeeke
for: let us goe into the Towne, and encompaſſe all with ſouldiers, leſt any
thing eſcape. <hi>Epicharis</hi> was overcome with griefe, when ſhe ſaw this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and accuſed her extreme miſery for the regret ſhe had for having ſo
well hitherto carried her plot, and the feare that ſhe might be a cauſe of the
death of <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede.</hi> Yet ſhe diſſembled as much as ſhe could the
trouble ſhe was in, for not giving any ſuſpition by her aſtoniſhment; and
conſidering how they knew aſſuredly at <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> were
living, as well becauſe of the cry was made, as to ſee the Goalers ſonne that
ſpake as he did, and the reſt that made ſearch for them, ſhe told them; I am
alone in this Countrey without any acquaintance, and know no newes of
<hi>Melintus</hi> or <hi>Palamede,</hi> with whom this Goaler had ſhut me up in a Chamber
of the priſon. I confeſſe to you truly, that when they ſav'd themſelves by
the chimney, and from thence by the top of the Tower, I was aſleepe, and I
thinke verily they had ſtupified me ſome way or other: but at length being
awake, and not finding them, becauſe they had left lights in the Chamber, I
was ſtrangely perplexed, and I knew not but that I was to goe give notice
that they had made their eſcape: in the end fearing to be accus'd of their
flight, for not having had care enough of them, I reſolv'd to ſave my ſelfe
by the ſame meanes they had done. But being deſcended by the rope, a
pinacle of the Tower fell downe that was like to have over-whelm'd me:
when I got free of thoſe ruines, I went away as faſt as I could, and never
ſince heard I any newes of them. She entertain'd with theſe reaſons <hi>Treba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
and thoſe that accompanied him, as they entred into the City: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they had ſome appearance of truth in them, they were not for all that
yet ſatisfied. <hi>Trebatius</hi> ſent to thoſe that were in another ſhip, for to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
them to come on ſhore; and how they were in hope to have newes there
of thoſe they ſought. In the meane time they went to repoſe them in the
moſt apparent houſe that was in all the City, as belonging to the Emperour.
<pb facs="tcp:7768:122"/>
                  <hi>Epicharis</hi> at the ſame time was ſounded on all ſides, and ſhe ſatisfied the beſt
ſhe could poſſibly all the demands were made her: but at laſt they of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ſhip arriv'd, among whom ſhe was very much aſtoniſh'd to know <hi>Dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus</hi>
and <hi>Piſiſtratus;</hi> then ſhe judged her ſelfe loſt. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
neare her, ſaid in looking firmly on her; If I be not deceiv'd this is
<hi>Epicharis</hi> diſguis'd, and this is not the firſt time ſhe has taken this habit: ſhee
had the confidence to enter thus into the priſon, and to ſave thoſe you are
ſeeking; and this Goaler had reaſon to know her. Every one ſtood in a
maze at the reſolution, and the wit of this young Maid. But, continues hee
in directing his ſpeech to her, if you be not the ſlave of this man, at leaſt, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
you cannot deny but you are mine. Your ſlave, anſwer'd ſhe reculing
a ſtep, and regarding him contemptuouſly, I am none of yours, but <hi>Ariana's</hi>
your Neece, to whom you gave me. No, no, replied he, you are my ſlave,
and by the right I have over you of life and death, I command you to tell me
where are <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> whom the Emperour makes ſearch for.
Goe, anſwered ſhe, hangman of thy bloud, that fear'ſt not to ſacrifice thy
Nephew for ſatisfaction of thy vengeance againſt <hi>Melintus:</hi> goe furious mad
man, that wilt deſtroy the onely hope of thy houſe, to pleaſe thy brutiſh paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
aſſure thy ſelfe the gods will puniſh thee. Yes, I confeſſe to thee I know
what Country they are in for the preſent, but be certaine that I will never tell
it, nor yet for what purpoſe they ſent me by Sea into <hi>Epire:</hi> and I ſhall make
it appeare to the cruelleſt executioners, that I have ſtill more conſtancy than
thou haſt rage. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> bluſh'd hearing thoſe ſenſible reproaches, and
could not anſwer her: but <hi>Trebatius</hi> for all that left not commanding they
ſhould put her into irons, untill ſhe had declared what ſhe knew. <hi>Epicharis</hi>
anſwered him as ſhe went out from his preſence, that hee then expected to
ſtay a long time in that place, or elſe to put her ſuddenly to death. She was
thus brought into an obſcure place, and as ſhe went ſhe ſaw one of thoſe that
led her away, which made himſelfe knowne to her. It was <hi>Arcas</hi> the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
freedman of <hi>Melintus,</hi> who told her in her eare, Let me know where they
are that are ſought, that I may adviſe them to ſave themſelves if it be poſſible.
She nam'd him the place ſo handſomely, that none perceiv'd this ſecrecy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they no whit miſtruſted <hi>Arcas;</hi> who as ſoone as ever <hi>Epicharis</hi> was ſhut
up, eſcaped from among thoſe of that troop, and went to finde <hi>Melintus</hi> and
thoſe of his company, that knew nothing of all had paſſed. <hi>Melintus</hi> was well
pleas'd to ſee againe his deare <hi>Arcas,</hi> and from him expected much ſuccours
in the neceſſity they were in. But he was in a great amazement, when hee
heard that <hi>Epicharis</hi> was taken, and had beene knowne by <hi>Dicearchus</hi> and <hi>Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus,</hi>
who were arriv'd at this City, with ſome <hi>Romans</hi> that on the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's
part ſought to put them to death. <hi>Arcas</hi> told them how <hi>Epicharis</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
reſolution enough never to tell the place they were in; that ſhe would
make them beleeve very finely, that they were in a very farre Countrey,
and had ſent her hither by Sea upon ſome defignes: but that he ſaw little
hope of eſcaping, becauſe the City was every where environed with ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
All theſe cruell newes diſmayed their ſpirits for griefe, that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
well forward in feares. Alas, ſaid the faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> it ſeemes the fury of
our misfortune aſſembles forces from all ſides of the earth, for to take from
us all hope of ſafety. What crime, good gods, have we committed, that you
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7768:123"/>
ſhould ſuffer men to perſecute us with ſuch rage? and from whom can wee
e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pect helpe, ſince he that ſerv'd in ſtead of a father to us, is the moſt anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to deſtroy us? Alas how miſerable am I to live! Without me, <hi>Melintus</hi>
ſhould not have beene here, nor my brother at this preſent; and but for me,
my uncle had not thus purſued their life. Juſt gods! if I be cauſe of their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
let me be puniſh'd onely: give an end to my life which is to them ſo
fatall, and by my bloud appeaſe your anger. But what? my bloud is too poore
a thing to extinguiſh ſo much choler: you will not have ſo much as one of
us eſcape. Well then, ye gods! delay not the time to make us periſh. Are we
ſo puiſſant and ſo redoubtable, that ſo much people muſt be brought againſt
ſo few perſons? Gather here together all the forces of the Empire: joyne
our very friends to our enemies; provoke beſides againſt us all the reſt of the
earth, with heaven and hell. The valour of <hi>Melintus</hi> and my brother is then
very formidable, ſince it makes it ſelfe be feared even of you; that you ſhould
need the aſſembly of ſo many powers for to vanquiſh them. <hi>Ariana</hi> in her
griefe, caſt againſt heaven all thoſe complaints, and if ſhe had beleev'd any
thing to be more rever'd yet than the gods, which might have power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
the reſorts of fortune; in that tranſport ſhe was in, ſhe would not
have feared to aſſault it. <hi>Melintus</hi> comforted her the beſt he could poſſibly,
and told her they were yet all eſtate, either to ſave themſelves by artifice;
or defend them by valour. At the worſt, that death was not a thing ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and that there were in life many things more to be dreaded: above all
he intreated her not to accuſe the gods for their calamity. We muſt take
heed, ſaid he, of offending thoſe, from whom ſuccours may be expected.
They have drawne us out of greater perils; and if they permit for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
that we be reduced to ſuch an extremity as this, it may be 'tis to the end
we ſhould acknowledge that we hold not our ſafety but of them. <hi>Melintus</hi>
thus labour'd to appeaſe the griefes of his deare <hi>Ariana,</hi> whoſe ſorrow was
more inſupportable to him than his owne misfortune. <hi>Lepantus</hi> alſo employed
all the Art of his eloquence, and all the force of his vertue, to finde out a
remedy, or at leaſt a conſolation for the danger they were in. There was
none but <hi>Palamede</hi> tranſported with fury, who knowing in what ſort <hi>Epicha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
was handled, and that ſhe was in danger of her life, would have parted
that very houre to finde out meanes for her delivery. What, ſaid he, ſhall I
let her dye that ſhe might make me live and be ſo unworthy as to ſecure my
owne life by the loſſe of hers? I will rather kill all thoſe that keepe her, and
my uncle himſelfe. Nothing is capable of reſiſting my love and courage in
ſuch an enterpriſe as this. Thus made he many threatnings in his fury, and
nothing ſeem'd impoſſible to him: but he was kept backe by the reſt, that
repreſented to him how by going forth he expos'd them to danger; that
they were to conſult a while what was to be done; and that if force were to
be uſed, he would much better bring to paſſe his deſigne, when he ſhould be
aſſiſted with all their troop. Theſe conſiderations ſomething appeas'd the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation
of his ſpirit; and the care they had over him, put him out of hope
of eſcaping their hands. In the meane time <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Lepantus</hi> enquir'd of
<hi>Arcas</hi> who they were that had queſtion'd <hi>Epicharis,</hi> and were landed at the
Port before <hi>Dicearchus;</hi> for it was neceſſary to know all, and how he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
them, to the end thereupon they might ſee what enemies they were
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7768:123"/>
to guard themſelves from, and what remedies they might invent in the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that menaced them. <hi>Arcas</hi> told them that the relation hee had to make
them upon this ſubject was ſomething long: that he was firſt to returne to
thoſe he had come with, that they entred not into ſuſpition of him if they
ſaw him not; but that he would preſently returne, and paſſe away the night
with them: eſpecially he would learne the reſolution had beene taken ſince
he left <hi>Epicharis.</hi> They let him goe, and having attended him with much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency,
he came backe about evening; and after they had eaten a little, he
aſſembled them all in a place, where ſetting himſelfe in the middeſt of them,
he began thus what he had to tell them:</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Hiſtory of Arcas, Trebatius, and Emilia.</head>
                  <p>IT muſt be confeſt that a benefit is never loſt, and that by knowing how
to acknowledge an obligation receiv'd, one ordinarily drawes on a ſecond:
for had it not beene for the care <hi>Melintus</hi> my Maſter tooke to ſend mee to
<hi>Rome</hi> with preſents for <hi>Maximus</hi> to recompence him for the loſſes he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
for our occaſion, I ſhould not now be here to advertiſe you of what
is prepared againſt you, and give you aſſiſtance according as I ſhall be
able.</p>
                  <p>When I was come to <hi>Rome,</hi> I enquir'd where <hi>Maximus</hi> dwelt, becauſe his
houſe that was conſum'd by the fire had not yet beene repaired. At laſt I
found him out, and having beene receiv'd by him more courteouſly than I
hoped for at my firſt comming, he was much rejoyc'd to heare newes of you;
for he beleev'd until then that you were dead; and accepted with a great deale
of difficulty the preſents I brought, eſteeming them, as he ſaid, too rich for
the ſmall ſervice he had rendred you. I demanded of him if there was nothing
ſpoken of you: he told me he had heard nothing at all concerning you: but
two dayes after word was brought us, that there was a publike cry made,
whereby it was ordained that <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede,</hi> who had eſcaped the
priſons of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould be killed in what place ſoever they were found, for
that they were enemies to <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the people of <hi>Rome.</hi> This newes ſtrucke
a terror into me; and inſtantly I prayed <hi>Maximus</hi> to goe to the Palace of
<hi>Nero,</hi> for to know in what manner the ſpeech went of them. He reported how
he had underſtood, that <hi>Trebatius,</hi> Tribune of the Emperor's guards, had a
command to goe with three companies of ſouldiers in ſearch of <hi>Melintus</hi> and
<hi>Palamede</hi> to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> or any other place where they thought to find them, and
that he furniſh'd a ſhip for this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Although I had much trouble in my mind, I left not thinking what I was
able to doe to ſerve you: I reſolv'd with my ſelfe to make me a ſouldier of
<hi>Nero's</hi> guards, and enter into the companies that were to follow <hi>Trebatius.
Maximus</hi> brought me acquainted with a Centurion, whom I gave an honeſt
preſent to, preſently he receiv'd me, and made ſhew of much affection to me.
I did my reverence to <hi>Trebatius,</hi> who finding me ready to ſerve, regarded me
favourably enough, and began to have a confidence in me; he many times
after that put commands upon me, and at laſt gave me the charge of Marſhall
of the lodgings to my company.</p>
                  <p>When we embarked us I obſerved neare him a young <hi>Roman</hi> very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7768:124"/>
whom he had a great reſpect to, and much care over: he wore a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
on his head that gave him much grace, and I ſaw that all his actions were
accompanied with much delicateneſſe. I imagin'd that I had ſeene his face
heretofore; but I could not tell who he ſhould be. <hi>Trebatius</hi> had given me
charge to take care of ſome ſtuffes, and I was laid downe amongſt them to
keepe them more ſure. This young <hi>Roman</hi> came to ſit downe by me, never
ſeeing me, becauſe I was laid. <hi>Trebatius</hi> who loſt not ſight of him, came
preſently neare to him; and never thinking there had beene any body that
ſaw them, or could liſten to them, he put one knee to the ground before him,
and taking his hand, ſaid to him; It ſeemes you flye from me, and what care
ſoever I take to doe you ſervice, I obſerve nothing in you but coldneſſe to
me, not to ſay contempt. <hi>Trebatius,</hi> anſwered he him, excuſe the violence
of the thoughts I am poſſeſt with: I forget not the due acknowledgement
of the paines you take to ſatisfie me; and I ſhall one day know how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the obligation I have to you. Ha! Madam, ſaid he. I was ſtrangely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd,
purſued <hi>Arcas,</hi> to heare that word, never having thought it had bin
a woman. That made me give eare more attentively. Ha! Madam, I ſay,
continued he, what have you then ordained concerning me? and if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that I could never finde what you are ſeeking, ſhould I alwayes be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable?
<hi>Trebatius,</hi> anſwered ſhe, uſe herein the greateſt care you can: for
be aſſured that I ſhall never make you contented, till I be revenged. Ha! ſaid
he, how cruell you are to me. What would you have, <hi>Trebatius,</hi> replied ſhe?
one paſſion hinders the other: as long as I ſhall have vengeance in my heart,
I can never have love there. But replied he againe, may I not know what cauſe
you have of ſo great a hate againſt <hi>Melintus?</hi> Oblige me by telling me it to
take part in your paſſion, that I may afterwards oblige you to take part in
mine. Tell me, faite <hi>Emilia,</hi> what <hi>Melintus</hi> has done to you. What! was't
<hi>Emilia?</hi> interrupted <hi>Melintus;</hi> ah! is not ſhe dead? That name, went <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi>
on, ſurpris'd me as much as it does you, and preſently I call'd to memory
that it was ſhe her ſelfe diſguis'd in a mans habit. That made me apprehend
being knowne by her; nevertheleſſe being not fallen yet into that accident,
I was reſolv'd to avoyd her preſence as much as I could: then I truſted in
the change that was made of me; for ſhe had not knowne me but a ſlave and
ſhorne, and ever ſince you gave me my liberty, I let my haire grow that quite
altered me. Is it very true then, replied <hi>Melintus</hi> all aſtoniſh'd, that ſhe is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving?
Give me leave, anſwer'd <hi>Arcas,</hi> to purſue the reſt, and you ſhall know
if it be ſhe or no. Ha gods! ſaid <hi>Melintus</hi> againe, there remain'd nothing but
to make the dead riſe againe againſt us; and I thinke there is not a thing now
in the world that has not conſpir'd our ruine. <hi>Arcas</hi> went forward thus. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia</hi>
anſwer'd <hi>Trebatius;</hi> Since you deſire to know the cauſe I have to hate
<hi>Melintus,</hi> I will not deny you this ſatisfaction; if you can receive any at all,
by learning how much love I have had to him: for I muſt confeſſe to you,
that he is the onely man that hath had the power to produce this paſſion in
me. But he has made me pay well with uſury for the time I deferr'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it into my heart, and has reveng'd to the full upon me the contempts I
had untill then of you, and ſome others. Know, continued ſhe, that this trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
inſinuated him into my heart by a very great appearance of vertue and
merits; obſerving a diſſembling modeſty, that knowes as often how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
<pb facs="tcp:7768:124"/>
vice as vertue. I deny not but he hath qualities that render him admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
but he muſt of neceſſity have a preſumption in him, that perſwades
him there is nothing in the world worthy of him: On the other ſide, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
ſo great a contempt of glory and praiſe, that one could hardly beleeve
he has any vanity. I ſweare to you that ſince I have cauſe to be his enemy;
conſidering of all his qualities, I know not what I ought to thinke of him; for
if he were vertuous, why did he expreſſe a love to me without having any?
and if he were not ſo, why did he refuſe the offers of my good will? Well,
he made love to me, and I loved him. Afterwards having beene hurt before
my lodging, and left for dead, I made him be carried home to my houſe;
where I aſſiſted him with more paſſion than a mother could have done the
deareſt of her ſonnes. This inſenſible man began to receive my endevours
and my aſſiſtances with coldneſſe and diſdaine; and I perceiv'd that my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
was alwayes troubleſome to him. At firſt I beleev'd that the paine of
his wounds caus'd his ill humour, or that it was griefe for a long ſickneſſe: but
ſince, a certaine <hi>Ariana,</hi> ſiſter of <hi>Palamede,</hi> came from <hi>Sicily,</hi> what ſickneſſe
ſoever was upon him, he ſpake no more but of retiring from me to goe to
her. I knew then he had never lov'd me, and was tormented with a cruell
jealouſie that gave me no repoſe. I ſaw well that I had no cauſe to retaine
him, ſince he lov'd me not; and yet I could not endure he ſhould forſake me.
Never had I experience of ſo many troubleſome paſſions as then diſtracted
me; but I confeſſe there cannot be imagin'd a more cruell torment. Love,
hatred, the reſentments of contempt and jealouſie, put me into ſuch a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that my mind was in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> perpetuall fury. There reſted for all that in me
I know not what hope, that beleeving him to be of a great ſpirit, he could
not but eſteeme himſelfe much oblig'd to me, for ſo many duties I had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
hi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> nevertheleſſe this ingrate, this perfidious man prayed me at laſt
to give him leave to retire. I expected that blow with a great deale of feare,
and receiving it I forc'd my ſelfe ſome time to perſwade him to ſtay ſtill with
me: but ſeeing him reſolv'd to be gone, I perceiv'd there is nothing ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
as the contempt and the ingratitude of that one loves. I could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
containe my ſelfe, but gave him all the reproaches an outraged lover
could make, in calling him traitor, villaine, ingratefull, and all that may be
ſaid in a furious anger. This artificiall man having given free liberty to my
rage, to make it loſe its force, began to pacifie me by little and little, by the
moſt flattering words deceit it ſelfe could have invented. He perſwaded me
to what he would, being ſo weakned by the agitations of my ſoule, that in
that eſtate it was eaſie for him to vanquiſh me. Then he labour'd to make me
beleeve things that were ſo pleaſing to my deſires, and that in ſuch ſort flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
my hopes, that I conſpir'd alſo with him for to abuſe my ſelfe. Never
had he expreſs'd ſo much paſſion to me, as he did at that time: he ſpared, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proteſtations, nor oaths, for to aſſure me of his love and his fidelity; and
feining ſome dayes that he could not be farre from my preſence, he obtain'd
inſenſibly leave to be gone, in making me hope that he would returne to me
every houre. Being thus eſcap'd out of my hands, he counterfetted himſelfe
ſicke, that he might not be oblig'd to ſee me againe, untill hee return'd into
<hi>Sicily.</hi> I ſent often to heare of him, and was advertis'd of all that paſſed at
their houſe, by the meanes of a young boy call'd <hi>Damis,</hi> ſlave of <hi>Maximus,</hi>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:7768:125"/>
who reported to me that nothing was ſo agreeable to <hi>Melintus,</hi> as the deare
aſſiſtance of this faire <hi>Ariana.</hi> It conſum'd my heart with jealouſie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite,
that he had thus deceiv'd me to get away. I attended ſtill a good while;
and the more time paſſed away, the more he made me loſe hope of ſeeing
him ever againe. This outrage ſeized me in ſuch wiſe as I became ſicke, and
willing to prove to what degree his ingratitude would proceed, or whether
pitty might not doe that which love could not obtaine, I gave out every
where that I was at the extremity, to try if he would not render me at leaſt
ſome office in the very laſt moments of my life. But this cruell man, this
Barbarian, was never touch'd for any accident that could arrive to me; and
had leſſe care of me, than if he had never knowne me. Not content yet with
that triall, I made it be reported that I was dead, to ſee if he would not come
to viſit <hi>Camilla,</hi> and to heare being cloſely hid, what he would ſay to her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the regret of my death; and I will tell you truly what my fury was then;
I was reſolved if he came, to come forth of my ambuſcado after I had heard
him a while; and to teare him in peeces with my teeth and with my nailes:
but all that mov'd him no more, than if he had had no ſoule; and I knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
that he had hindred <hi>Palamede</hi> from comming to ſee my ſiſter, upon the
accident was thought to have befallen me. I knew not now in the extreme
dolour I was in, what artifice to uſe, nor what reſolution to take, when the
paſſion of others was neare to have ſuccour'd mine, and ſupplied the defect
of my inventions. <hi>Marcelin,</hi> as I knew of <hi>Damis,</hi> to be reveng'd of theſe <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilians</hi>
to whom he was enemy, attempted to burne them all one night in
their houſe, or if they got out, to kill <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede,</hi> and to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<hi>Ariana</hi> in that diſorder, for to give her to the Emperour. This enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
as I came to know ſince, ſucceeded not well for <hi>Marcelin,</hi> who was ſlaine
without the City by <hi>Melintus,</hi> and <hi>Ariana</hi> ſav'd her ſelfe by I know <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> what
meanes: but the day after, <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Melintus</hi> were taken and brought
priſoners to <hi>Rome.</hi> Never, purſued <hi>Emilia,</hi> had I ſo much joy as to learne
that they were deſtin'd to death, being accuſed for having ſet fire on the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and when I was advertis'd that they were to be brought before the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to have judgement, I diſguis'd me in the ſame eſtate as I am now for the
preſent in, to ſee what countenance they had, and to what puniſhment they
ſhould be condemned; and ſlipping into the Senate-houſe among the crowd,
I ſo wrought that I got a place, whence I could ſee them at my eaſe. I ſaw
this traitor preſent himſelfe without any amazement, and in ſeeing him, I
became pale, and a ſhaking horror ſurpriz'd me that tooke from me all
ſtrength. The trembling that had ſeiz'd me, quitted me not as long as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
him: but when he began to ſpeake, I felt my ſelfe even gone, ſo was I
taken with the different paſſions that perplexed me. In the end I recollected
a little force and courage; and ſeeing in what ſort he defended himſelfe; Ha!
ſaid I to my ſelfe, ſee how this deceiver ſpake to me, when hee would abuſe
me. How well he knowes to diſguiſe the cauſes of their miſery, and his love
for <hi>Ariana.</hi> He dares not pronounce that name for feare of being troubled.
And yet I confeſſe to you that I felt my ſelfe affected with the things he ſaid;
and my hatred was not powerfull enough to reſiſt the force of his diſcourſe.
I would have had them adjudged him to death, and yet I well ſaw that it was
impoſſible to condemne him. I attended his judgement with as much trouble
<pb facs="tcp:7768:125"/>
as if it had beene my owne; and for all I deſir'd he ſhould dye, I ſurpris'd my
ſelfe ſometimes in the eſtate of having a feare for his life. But yet for all that
I ſaw they were about to abſolve him, and I was angry and content at the
ſame time: but when they came from <hi>Nero</hi> to command the judgement to
be ſurceaſed, for that he would declare his will upon the matter, I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
in what ſtate I was in. I well perceiv'd how the Emperour feared leſt
they ſhould have beene diſmiſſed and quitted, and that this ſignified an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable
death: but I could not rejoyce at the aſſurance of their misfortune.
Nevertheleſſe when <hi>Melintus</hi> was ſent backe againe to priſon, and I ſaw him
no more, I re-entred into fury againſt him. I accus'd my ſelfe that I had not
provoked the Judges to puniſh them, that I had not invented ſome crime
to have made them be condemn'd at the inſtant: I repreſented to my ſelfe all
the contempts and all the indignities he had offered me, and was impatient
till <hi>Nero</hi> ſent to murther them in the priſon. All day long I did noting but
torment my ſelfe upon this occaſion; and at night I could not ſleepe. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
in my mind that I ſaw <hi>Nero's</hi> ſoldiers enter the priſon, and maſſacre
with a thouſand blowes that perfidious man. I imagin'd that I arrived there
at the ſame time, and rejoyc'd to ſee him in the expectation of death, and
then to waſh my hands in his bloud. After I had paſs'd away the night in
theſe ravings, I ſent to know at the priſon, if they were not yet dead: but
they brought me word that all was in great tumult there, and how they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev'd
they had precipitated them from the top of the Tower into the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
having found meanes to get out by the chimney of the Chamber where
they lay: that a great multitude of people was about the river, and many
men in Boats to ſearch for the dead bodies which were thought either drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or brained, becauſe a pinacle of the Tower was fallen downe with them.
My fury perſwaded me to a ſtrange curioſity: I would needs goe to the very
place where they ſearch'd for the bodies, for to ſatiate my ſight with that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle;
and I beleeve that if <hi>Melintus</hi> his had beene found, I ſhould have died
for joy to ſee it. But all the care ſo many perſons tooke, and I my ſelfe that
gave money to have the water ſearch'd, proved unprofitable: the night
came on, and I was conſtrain'd to give over this ſearch, with all the reſt of
them that had labour'd in vaine. I wanted not ſatisfaction, though it were
not entire, beleeving them to be dead, and that the ſtreame had carried
them away. Some dayes after when I would goe upon the water, I made
them conduct me farre out of the City, to ſee if peradventure theſe bodies
were not caſt by the ſtreame upon ſome banke. A young youth that guided
us, ſeeing an empty Boat at the banks-ſide, told us without thinking any
thing; See there a Boat without a Maſter. I ask'd him what he meant: hee
anſwered me; A young man bought it, but I beleeve it was not to make
himſelfe a Water-man; and gave it me to keepe that night the priſoners
ſav'd themſelves. Then he added a little after; They thought good to
ſearch in the water the other daye I beleeve they are farre enough off by
this. I fretted, purſued <hi>Emilia,</hi> to heare him ſpeake thus; and I urg'd him to
tell me what he knew of the buſineſſe. I will tell you, ſayes he, upon condition
you will not diſcover me; which having promis'd him, he continues, that he
had ſeene the priſoners ſave themſelves in that Boat, after they had beene
a long time deſcending from the Tower by a rope, and how hee ſaw them
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7768:126"/>
paſſe by, becauſe that night he watched upon the river. I made as if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyc'd,
added <hi>Emilia,</hi> that they were ſafe; but in my ſoule I reſolv'd not to
let them ſcape ſo unpuniſhed; and he that had well regarded me would have
ſeene that I could not chooſe but have my face all of a fire for exceſſe of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.
What, ſaid I to my ſelfe, ſhall this Barbarian be preſently in <hi>Sicily</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
his faire <hi>Ariana?</hi> and have no dearer entertainments with her than to
relate what contempts he made of my affection? and ſhall he boaſt himſelfe
all his life time for having ſecurely triumph'd over all my paſſions? No, I
will not dye ſo, without a revenge: he is not ſo ſafe as he thinks himſelfe to
be. I will purſue him into what part of the earth ſoever he retires; and if I
be not powerfull enough my ſelfe, I will provoke the fury of all the world
againſt him, to hinder his eſcaping out of my hands. I return'd into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
muſing of a thouſand wayes to his deſtruction: but to be more aſſured
that he were living, I reſolv'd to ſend one of my men expreſly to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi>
that might enquire, if <hi>Melintus</hi> were arriv'd there. This man reported to me
all the rejoycings were made at their returne; the ſacrifices and the playes,
with the glory of <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Ariana,</hi> whom they beleev'd to ſee very ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
married together. All theſe things ſo animated me with jealouſie, ſhame,
and deſpite, that I purpos'd to prevent their happineſſe by the death of that
villaine. I advis'd to make uſe of the Emperours power, that I might not
faile of my enterpriſe. I ſaw you then, more than of cuſtome, ſayes ſhe to
<hi>Trebatius,</hi> becauſe I began to acknowledge that you had alwayes lov'd me
with a true affection, and that had reſiſted all my contempts; and I was
ſorry for having made choyce of this traitor and this perjurious man, in ſtead
of you that were never wanting to me: I reſolv'd to be no more ingrate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, but to content your juſt deſires; upon condition you ſhould firſt
ſee me reveng'd upon <hi>Melintus.</hi> You promis'd me to ſatisfie my paſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you would preſſe me to content yours. It was then, continued <hi>Emilia,</hi>
that I gave you advice to goe and declare to <hi>Nero,</hi> that <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede,</hi>
his enemies, were living; and to demand a Commiſſion from him
to goe put them to death. I deſir'd beſides to have it publiſh'd throughout
<hi>Rome,</hi> and all the Cities of the Empire, that they ſhould be kill'd in what
place ſoever they were found; and I was willing my ſelfe to aſſiſt you in this
Commiſſion by diſguiſing me thus, that if it were poſſible, I might kill that
perfidious wretch with my owne hand: for I confeſſe to you it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
pleaſure I can ever hope for in all my life. <hi>Emilia</hi> ended thus, purſues
<hi>Arcas,</hi> and <hi>Trebatius</hi> anſwered her: Well then, Madam, I ſee that he muſt
dye, or I ſhall never have any contentment from you: Now I know how
much cauſe you have to ſeeke his death, I will joyne the deſire of revenging
your injuries, to that deſire I had before onely to obey you. They had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſcourſes afterwards together, ſayes <hi>Arcas,</hi> beſides theſe. O gods!
interrupted <hi>Melintus,</hi> muſt this woman live ſtill for my torment? See what
rage ſhe is poſſeſs'd of. <hi>Arcas</hi> prayed him to let him goe on, and hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied:
I was in a ſtrange wonder to have heard all <hi>Emilia's</hi> fury; yet I
had an opinion that the gods had ſuffered me to be advertiſed of all theſe
things, to give me the meanes of doing you ſervice. I had no other care,
than to keepe my ſelfe from being knowne to <hi>Emilia;</hi> and ſo wee arrived
at <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> I knew very well you were not there, ſo as in that place I was
<pb facs="tcp:7768:126"/>
in no feare for you. About the evening we landed, and were lodged in
the City. Preſently I went to ſee <hi>Telephus,</hi> and told him of the ſearch was
making after you, which troubled him exceedingly. We advis'd, that we
were that very night to ſend tickets all about the Towne, for to intreat
thoſe of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> if they loved <hi>Melintus,</hi> to take heed of telling the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
whither he was gone, becauſe they ſought to put him to death. We
brought this to paſſe, and the peoples love was ſo great towards you, ſayes
he to <hi>Melintus,</hi> that <hi>Trebatius</hi> and <hi>Emilia</hi> were more than eight dayes enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
after you in all places, without being able to learne any newes at
all. As for me, I had reſolv'd to goe to Sea in the meane time, and finde
you out at <hi>Corinth,</hi> to advertiſe you to ſave your ſelfe; but they had
ſtayed all the ſhipping at the Port; ſo as this was impoſſible for me to doe.
At laſt, I cannot tell by what meanes, but they came to know whither you
were gone: preſently they made us goe on ſhip-board againe, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
with them, after I had taken my leave of <hi>Telephus, Hyperia,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rycine,</hi>
whom I left all in teares: I curs'd the winds for being ſo favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to us; for we arriv'd at <hi>Corinth</hi> in leſſe time than could be hoped; and
at the Port found all in great trouble. <hi>Trebatius</hi> demanded what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was; and they told him they had carried away certaine Maids in ſhips
that ſet ſaile not above an houre before. We went on ſhore, and I was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amaz'd to meet <hi>Dicearchus</hi> and <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> who were buſie in preparing
a Veſſell to goe out after the raviſhers. <hi>Trebatius</hi> ask'd him what his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was. <hi>Roman</hi> Lord, ſaid he, I had a Neece, the government of whom
was committed to me by my brother when he lay a dying. I had promis'd
her to <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> you ſee there, ſayes he in ſhewing him; and a traitor
call'd <hi>Melintus</hi> is come from <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and hath taken her away from me.
Ha! the villaine, cryed out <hi>Emilia,</hi> 'tis the ſame man wee are ſeeking for
the Emperour, to have him dye. Comfort your ſelfe good man, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
ſhe, we ſhall revenge you well enough. I beleeve, replied <hi>Trebatius,</hi>
they are in one of the two ſhips we encountred ſayling towards the coaſts
of <hi>Greece;</hi> we are to loſe no more time, to depart and follow them: if
your Veſſell be ready, ſaid hee to <hi>Dicearchus</hi> and <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> accompanie
us, and wee will joyne our quarrels together. Never ſaw I any thing ſo
encourag'd as <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> who haſtned his imbarquement with <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi>
as faſt as he could; and when <hi>Trebatius</hi> and <hi>Emilia</hi> ſet ſaile, he followed
them.</p>
                  <p>After having paſſed the promontory of <hi>Naupactum,</hi> wee tooke the right
hand along the <hi>Grecian</hi> Coaſts, and came into all the ports one after the
other, where we did but enquire if two Veſſels had not arriv'd very late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
Thus went we into divers places never hearing any newes of you.
At laſt we arrived here; where being deſcended, <hi>Epicharis</hi> that was at
the Port diſguis'd in a man, was ſo unhappy, as to be knowne by the
Goalers ſonne, that kept you priſoners at <hi>Rome.</hi> He had accompanied us
having knowne the deſigne of <hi>Trebatius;</hi> for his father being kept in
irons, becauſe hee had beene too negligent over you, hee was in hope to
deliver him, by lending his helpe to make you be put to death, and for
this reaſon he embark'd with us. You may ſee by this how many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
have encountred together for to worke your ruine, and this is that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7768:127"/>
we are for the preſent to endevour to defend you from. But even now when
I left you, I learn'd that they had ſet ſtraight guard at all the ports, and
along the walls of the Towne: from thence I went to marke out the
lodgings for thoſe of my company: and I have kept for my ſelfe a very
commodious one, that it may ſerve you, if you ſhould have occaſion to
uſe it; then I came to find you againe, and we muſt for the preſent adviſe how
we ought to order our ſelves, and in what ſort I may ſuccour you. <hi>Arcas</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thus, and he was heard of all with much aſtoniſhment and feare, learning
by his diſcourſe ſo many occurrences that were prepar'd to make their deaths
inevitable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melintus</hi> brake off his ſilence then and ſaid, Well then I ſee 'tis but my
life they require; they ſeeke neither <hi>Palamede,</hi> nor any one of you: by my
dying I will make them all ſatisfied, and deliver all of you from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
wherein you are for me alone. Yes, I will goe and preſent my ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them; I will open my boſome with a ponyard in their preſence, for to
content with one blow the vengeance of the Emperour, of <hi>Emilia,</hi> and of
<hi>Dicearchus.</hi> Were it not farre better to let it appeare, that none was able to
make me dye but my ſelfe, rather than fall unworthily into their hands, and
receive a ſhamefull death? It is no fury this, that tranſports me. If I ſaw
any appearance to ſecure my ſelfe and you too, by valour, or by any other
meanes, I ſhould be much troubled to deſire to loſe my life before I loſt all
hope: but ſeeing us environ'd with men of warre on all ſides, 'twere better I
dyed alone courageouſly, than to attempt meanes that could never ſucceed,
but bury you all under my ruine. The ſage <hi>Lepantus</hi> ſtopped this diſcourſe of
<hi>Melintus,</hi> in putting his hand upon his arme, and ſaid to him; Pardon me, if
I eſteeme you not exempt from tranſport, in the reſolution you take. Thoſe
that have a great courage as you have, when they offer themſelves to dye, are
carried many times away to this deſire, rather out of a pleaſure they finde in
deſpiſing death, than for any neceſſity that obliges them to deſire it. But we
are never excuſable for having prevented our deſtiny, as long as wit or force
are yet capable of ſurmounting the rigour of fortune. We are to make a triall
of all things before that extremity, and not to neglect the meaneſt hope that
may be left us. One moment of time may change the ſtate of the whole
world; and this ſame fortune that aſſembles ſo many enemies to deſtroy you,
can with a reverſe bring themſelves to ruine, and overthrow ſo many acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
by one alone. They know not yet where we are; <hi>Arcas</hi> is in good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
to give us advice every houre; and if you muſt dye, ſtay at leaſt till you
can no longer live. For my part, I am of opinion that we change our lodging,
and goe preſently into that that <hi>Arcas</hi> has taken for himſelfe in the Towne, as
if we were <hi>Romans</hi> too; becauſe that lodging being marked for them, they
will never come to ſeeke us out there. Then muſt <hi>Arcas</hi> goe and advertiſe
thoſe of our ſhip, that they retire to a bay I ſaw hard by, for feare they
ſhould diſcover us, if they enquir'd of them: we will finde out afterwards
ſome meanes to deliver <hi>Epicharis.</hi> Thoſe reaſons, and that counſell appeas'd
<hi>Melintus,</hi> and gave a little conſolation to all the company: preſently they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to follow the propoſitions of <hi>Lepantus,</hi> and to depart that houſe to goe
into that <hi>Arcas</hi> had reſerv'd for himſelfe. It was done that very night, and
what ever they had more precious than other, was tranſported into that
<pb facs="tcp:7768:127"/>
lodging, which was commodious enough; the houſe they were in was left to
thoſe it belonged to, whom they tooke leave of, feining to goe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque
themſelves: they left them reaſonably well rewarded, and obliged
them by their preſents not to tell that any of them had ſtayed in that place.
<hi>Arcas</hi> went towards the ſhip, which he ſent away to that ſame Bay, with a
charge that if they were found, they ſhould not tell whoſe men they were,
but to feine any thing rather.</p>

hapned, in ſtead of ſo many expected joyes, <hi>Trebatius</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia</hi>
made an exact ſearch throughout all the City, except the
houſes where the <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers were, who had all of them
given their faiths that no Citizen was lodged with them. <hi>Arcas</hi>
made himſelfe the buſieſt man of all, in ferretting all the corners of houſes,
being certaine that they would never goe into his. About evening he failed
not to appeare there, and aſſure his good Maſter and all the company, that
he hoped to keepe them from being diſcovered; and that <hi>Epicharis</hi> was to
be admir'd at for her reſolution, not to diſconceale them; eſpecially that ſhe
had remov'd the opinion of their being in that Countrey at all: ſhee fear'd
onely leſt they might not expoſe her to ſome puniſhment. That word ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<hi>Palamede,</hi> as he reſolv'd either to dye, or ſave her. He enquir'd of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi>
in what part of <hi>Trebatius</hi> houſe ſhe was ſhut up, and how many perſons
were appointed for her guard; and when he had learn'd all the particulars he
deſir'd to know, he feined no more thinking of her, and went to bed. But
when he thought every body aſleepe, he deſcended downe the window by
his ſheets into the ſtreet, having no other armes but his ſword. He went to
<hi>Trebatius</hi> lodging, at the gate whereof was a <hi>Corps de guard,</hi> where being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
without any trouble, becauſe they tooke him for one of the ſouldiers,
he went on towards the deſcent of the obſcure place where <hi>Epicharis</hi> was
enclos'd; and finding a ſouldier that kept the entry, he threw his cloake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his head for feare he ſhould cry out, and at the ſame time ſtabbed him
twice or thrice into the body; and went not from thence till the ſouldier had
expir'd. He went downe afterwards without feare into that obſcurity; and
was come even to the doore of the dungeon, where was another ſouldier
with the keyes, and a little light about him. This ſouldier ſurpriz'd, ask'd
him who he was; but <hi>Palamede</hi> not willing to give him the leiſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, aſſail'd him with good blowes of his ſword, and preſently laid him
dead at his feet. Then he tooke the keyes, and with the helpe of the little
light he had, open'd the dungeon doore. <hi>Epicharis</hi> beleev'd that they came
for her, to propound more queſtions, or elſe to make her confeſſe ſomething
<pb facs="tcp:7768:128"/>
by torment: but when ſhe felt her ſelfe embrac'd by <hi>Palamede,</hi> ſhe tooke him
for ſome indiſcreet ſouldier, and repuls'd him rudely. But for all that <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
making him knowne to her, and expreſſing a thouſand joyes for ſeeing
her againe, ſhe was exceedingly amaz'd, and ask'd him how he was able to
come thither. He related to her all he had done: then he ſaid how they
were to loſe no time, and prayed her to make haſte to goe out with him. I
am faſt, ſayes ſhe, by the feet; and I am much afraid that all your paines
have prov'd unuſefull, and that you be not here in great danger for having
ſlaine my guards. Nevertheleſſe ſearching among the keyes, they were ſo
fortunate as to finde thoſe of her irons. <hi>Palamede</hi> open'd the locke, and full of
rapture for delivering his Miſtreſſe, kiſſed her faire feet, and curſed a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times thoſe that had made ſo delicate a perſon endure ſuch miſery. At
laſt <hi>Epicharis</hi> after having tried a while if ſhe could goe well, reſolv'd to be
gone. <hi>Palamede</hi> was of opinion ſhe ſhould goe out alone, as he had entred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
and that he would follow her preſently after: and, for feare ſhe ſhould
be knowne, he made her take the Coat-armour, and the Caſque of one of
the two ſouldiers he had kill'd, to the end they might let her paſſe without
difficulty. She would have had him goe firſt alone; but it became her to
give way to the love of <hi>Palamede.</hi> She paſſed therefore without feare ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd,
through the <hi>Corps de guard,</hi> and being eſcap'd ſhe ſtayed ſome time in
a place for to goe along with <hi>Palamede,</hi> whoſe fortune had beene very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from hers: for having delayed the time a while, he was going out alſo,
after he had taken the Caſque and Coat-armour of the other dead ſouldier:
but when he was very neare out, a ſouldier ſtayed him by the arme, and ask'd
him whither he went? He anſwer'd him in the <hi>Roman</hi> language, that he was
going out by the command of <hi>Trebatius:</hi> but when he was demanded the
word, he could not tell it; and though he tooke his ſword in hand to eſcape
by valour, yet they fail'd not to encompaſſe, and ſeize upon him. By and by
after the dead ſouldiers were found, and they knew that <hi>Epicharis</hi> was eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.
<hi>Palamede</hi> was kept till the next day, attending the waking of <hi>Trebatius;</hi>
and betimes in the morning he was brought before him: but when <hi>Dicearchus</hi>
was ſent for to know him, there cannot be deſcrib'd an aſtoniſhment like to
that of this old man, who proſecuted the death of <hi>Melintus,</hi> never thinking
his Nephew had beene with him, but that he was ſtill at <hi>Athens,</hi> whither he
thought he had gone. In the end being come to himſelfe againe, he intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Trebatius</hi> to ſave his Nephew's life, who was in no ſort guilty of what
<hi>Melintus</hi> had done: but <hi>Trebatius</hi> willing to ſatisfie the command he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
of the Emperour, and revenge the death of his ſouldiers, by puniſhing
the hardy enterpriſe of <hi>Palamede,</hi> commanded him to be ſet in the place of
<hi>Epicharis,</hi> and if he would not tell where <hi>Melintus</hi> was, that within two dayes
they ſhould put him to death. <hi>Palamede</hi> ſaid, it was a long time agoe ere he
had ſeene <hi>Melintus,</hi> and that his uncle could witneſſe for him, with whom he
parted from <hi>Syracuſe</hi> to goe to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and after that had taken leave of him
to goe to <hi>Athens:</hi> that he had a deſire to ſee in order, all the Cities of <hi>Greece</hi>
and <hi>Epire;</hi> and being arriv'd at this, he had learn'd that <hi>Epicharis</hi> was retain'd
priſoner, whom he lov'd ſufficiently for to undertake her deliverance: that
ſince he had beene ſo happy as to effect it, he tooke no more care for any
thing could happen to himſelfe. <hi>Trebatius</hi> ſaid, how this encounter of him
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:7768:129"/>
and <hi>Epicharis,</hi> made him beleeve, it was not true he told; and that they might
very well have newes of the other perſon they ſought, ſince already they had
one of them in their power. Aſſure your ſelfe, purſues he, that if you declare
not to me where <hi>Melintus</hi> is, torments ſhall make you confeſſe it. There is no
torment, anſwers he, capable to make me ſay that I know not. I am ignorant
where he is, and for what cauſe you make ſearch for him: you ought not to
delay the time of putting me to death, for having ſlaine your ſouldiers, if
you prolong my life onely in hope to learne newes of <hi>Melintus,</hi> of whom I
can tell you nothing, but that I left him at <hi>Syracuſe. Arcas</hi> was preſent, who
was come in haſte to <hi>Trebatius</hi> his, very early; becauſe <hi>Palamede</hi> had not been
found in his bed, and they all imagin'd that he had done ſome ſtrange enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
for <hi>Epicharis,</hi> the unfortunate event whereof he conſider'd, full of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and deſpaire. <hi>Palamede</hi> was led to the priſon whence he had drawne <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picharis,</hi>
what entreaty ſoever <hi>Dicearchus</hi> could make to ſave him; and <hi>Arcas</hi>
went to report theſe wofull newes to <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Ariana,</hi> and he told them
that they knew not what was become of <hi>Epicharis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This affliction renewed the weepings of <hi>Ariana,</hi> and put <hi>Melintus</hi> out of
all patience, who having followed untill then the wiſe counſels of <hi>Lepantus,</hi>
could not endure to ſee the griefe of <hi>Ariana</hi> for her brother, and the danger
his friend was in. He tooke <hi>Arcas</hi> aſide, and made him ſweare that he would
inviolably obey his commands: then he told him, that he was reſolv'd to
deliver <hi>Palamede;</hi> but what miſadventure ſoever chanc'd him in that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
he charg'd him, not to declare himſelfe to be any of his; to the end he
might preſerve <hi>Ariana</hi> with their friends, and that they never came into
the power of <hi>Trebatius</hi> and <hi>Emilia.</hi> This faithfull ſervant labour'd to make
him change this deadly reſolution: but <hi>Melintus</hi> aſtoniſh'd him, by ſwearing,
that if he oppos'd his deſigne any longer, or advertis'd <hi>Ariana</hi> of it, he would
ſtrike himſelfe with his ſword into the body. He recommended to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the care he was to have all his life long over <hi>Ariana,</hi> whoſe ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he committed to his charge. <hi>Arcas</hi> knew not what to ſay, ſeeing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperateneſſe
of his Maſter, who commanded him beſides to goe preſently out
of the houſe, and attend him at <hi>Trebatius</hi> his, where he ſhould be a witneſſe
of what he meant to doe. And thus was it that <hi>Melintus</hi> hindred <hi>Arcas</hi> from
declaring his deſigne: inſtantly he choſe out eight young ſouldiers that had
followed him from <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> whom he had proved to be full of great courage,
and who admiring his vertue, expreſs'd a paſſionate affection to him. He
acquainted them with his purpoſe, and perceiving how they entertain'd with
joy this occaſion of dying at his ſervice, he made them arme them under
their Caſſaques, and without ſpeaking to his deare <hi>Ariana,</hi> or to <hi>Lepantus,</hi>
went out armed as they were. He would ſerve himſelfe of nothing but his
valour in that enterpriſe, without employing any other artifice. As ſoone as
he was come before <hi>Trebatius</hi> gate, he caſt himſelfe bravely into the <hi>Corps de
guard</hi> with his companions, and after having kill'd above ſix ſouldiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the others were avis'd of them, he ſhut the doore upon him, for feare
there might not come ſuccours to <hi>Trebatius.</hi> The Alarme was preſently all
over the houſe, and more than thirty perſons were aſſembled together, for
to ſuſtaine them: they gave not over their purſuit of cutting in peeces what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
preſented it ſelfe before them; and never gave <hi>Melintus</hi> ſo many
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:7768:129"/>
proofes of his valour, as having to defeat the moſt warlike amongſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
ſouldiers. His companions that labour'd to imitate him, ſeem'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
new forces by ſeeing the great blowes he gave, and beleev'd that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could vanquiſh them in the company of ſo valorous a man. Already a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
twenty <hi>Romans</hi> had beene ſlaine, when <hi>Trebatius,</hi> himſelfe came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thither, with <hi>Emilia, Dicearchus,</hi> and <hi>Piſiſtratus;</hi> and ſeeing this ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his men, and ſo valiant enemies that purſued them, he could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
what they were, nor how they ſhould conceive ſo furious a deſigne:
nevertheleſſe ſeeing that it became him to joyne himſelfe to the number, he
prayed <hi>Emilia</hi> to retire, and goe ſee their combat out at a window. It was ſhe
that knew <hi>Melintus</hi> firſt of all, and ſhewed him to <hi>Trebatius: Dicearchus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd
him too, and being retir'd with <hi>Emilia</hi> into one of the Chambers,
they ſaw that <hi>Trebatius</hi> had put on armes, and was engag'd in the fight with
the reſt. <hi>Arcas</hi> that he might not be oblig'd to ſtrike his Maſter, or his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
had broken his ſword, and mingling with <hi>Trebatius</hi> ſouldiers, ſeem'd
to be one of the firſt in fighting againſt them, for to hinder by this meanes
the moſt daring of their party from approaching them. <hi>Melintus</hi> perceiving
<hi>Trebatius</hi> whom he knew, thought of nothing but aſſaulting him, hoping
that if he were once defeat of him, the reſt would ſoone be diſheartned, and
eaſily diſpatch'd. On the other ſide <hi>Trebatius</hi> refuſed not the combat, being
in deſpaire to ſee ſo great a number of his men upon the place, and <hi>Melintus</hi>
began to have a good hope of his attempt, ſeeing ſo many dead about him,
and that he was ſtill aſſiſted with ſix of his company againſt a few that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd.
But by misfortune a <hi>Roman</hi> was advis'd to goe fetch by a backe way,
thoſe that guarded the gates of the City, who came running inſtantly; ſo as
<hi>Melintus</hi> was environ'd on all ſides. The ſix that remain'd with him were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
put to the ſword, and <hi>Emilia</hi> ſeeing him alone, cried from aloft to <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batius,</hi>
that they ſhould not take away his life. <hi>Melintus</hi> was even ready to
be trodden downe with the crowd of thoſe that ſet upon him, but yet he ſtill
left not ſtrowing the place with dead bodies, in the fury he was in; and they
were afraid to come neare him by reaſon of the great blowes he gave on all
ſides of him: but at laſt he was taken by meanes of a <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldier, who
in dying, for rage tooke hold of his legges, and made him fall. Thus was this
prodigious valour conſtrain'd to yeeld to ſo cruell a fortune, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he was carried into a dungeon apart, and laden with irons by order from
<hi>Emilia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During this tumult, <hi>Dicearchus</hi> minding the ſafety of <hi>Palamede,</hi> was gone
towards the place where he was, and having given money to a ſouldier that
was left alone to guard the entrance, becauſe the reſt were run away to the
defence of <hi>Trebatius,</hi> he perſwaded him to let him goe, being able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
himſelfe upon the diſorder that had hapned. This man having beene thus
gained, <hi>Dicearchus</hi> conducted his Nephew by a backe doore, never telling
him the occaſion of the rumour he heard (for without doubt he would have
ſuccour'd <hi>Melintus,)</hi> and having given him advice to ſave himſelfe, he return'd
to <hi>Trebatius,</hi> who was then thinking of carrying away the bodies of ſo many
dead men as were in the Court of his houſe, and could not ſufficiently won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at the great courage of <hi>Melintus,</hi> and his reſolution for the ſafety of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamede.
Emilia</hi> was well pleaſed to have <hi>Melintus</hi> in her power, and was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7768:130"/>
in her minde what kinde of death ſhe ſhould give him, being reſolv'd
to kill him with her owne hand. Then word was brought them how <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
had beene ſaved, and there was a ſouldier that accus'd <hi>Dicearchus</hi> for
having beene towards the priſon: thereupon thoſe that guarded him being
not to be found, they conjectur'd that <hi>Dicearchus</hi> had gained them, whereat
<hi>Trebatius</hi> being offended, made him be put into the ſame dungeon, where
his Nephew had beene before, neare unto that wherein <hi>Melintus</hi> was, and
was reſolv'd to put him to death, for having dar'd to corrupt his men, and
ſave the enemies of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and at the ſame time he made <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
from his preſence.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide <hi>Palamede</hi> being got out, knew not what to thinke to
ſee all the City in a rumour: and yet conſidering of nothing at that time
but his owne ſafety, he regained the lodging of <hi>Arcas;</hi> never enquiring what
the matter was. But he was greatly amaz'd when he underſtood that <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
was gone out with eight ſouldiers, and he could not imagine for what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
he had ſtollen away from his troop in that equipage. Inſtantly he would
depart, for to goe ſeeke and ſuccour him, but he was hindred by the arrive
of <hi>Arcas,</hi> who learn'd them all that had paſſed. The faire <hi>Ariana</hi> who began
to dry her teares for her brothers return, felt then a new affliction that open'd
afreſh the ſource of them. Every one was in ſuch a deſpaire at this calamity,
for the affection they bare <hi>Melintus,</hi> that in ſtead of comforting her, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
by their extreme griefe what cauſe ſhe had to afflict her ſelfe. <hi>Palamede</hi>
ſeeing in what ſort he was oblig'd to <hi>Melintus,</hi> for having conceiv'd ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
an enterpriſe for his ſafety, was fully reſolv'd to render him the like: but
he could not yet invent the meanes to effect it; and he onely mingled his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
with the extreme diſpleaſures of his ſiſter, <hi>Lepantus,</hi> and <hi>Cyllenia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Emilia</hi> that meditated of nothing but the meanes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ſatisfying her vengeance, having in her hands the ſubject of all her furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
paſſions, conſider'd that if ſhe could get <hi>Ariana</hi> into her power, ſhe might
have wherewith to puniſh her, for being cauſe of her torments, and an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
beſides to aggravate the puniſhments of <hi>Melintus,</hi> by the reſentments
he ſhould have at that ſhe would make <hi>Ariana</hi> ſuffer, before ſhe put him to
death; and doubting that ſhe might be in the ſame place, ſince <hi>Melintus</hi> was
met there, with <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Epicharis,</hi> ſhe made a further ſearch in all parts
to have her in her hands. But <hi>Arcas</hi> knew ſo well to divert the ſcrutiny that
might be made in his houſe, that ſhe could never learne any newes of her.
Many dayes were thus conſum'd in this ſearch about the City, and ſome
places adjoyning: in the end not able any longer to deferre her revenge, and
<hi>Trebatius</hi> urging her to put an end to the life of <hi>Melintus,</hi> for to give a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to his happineſſe; ſhe reſolv'd one morning to goe her ſelfe and kill
him with her owne hand. She tooke a ponyard, and Guides to conduct her to
the dungeon; then being ſure that <hi>Melintus</hi> could not defend himſelfe from
her, becauſe he had his hands tyed behind him, and irons at his feet, ſhe ſent
away thoſe that were with her, to enter alone into that obſcurity with a torch
in her hand; having yet ſome ſhame left, to commit that action in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of another. What? ſaid ſhe to her ſelfe in entring, it ſeemes I tremble,
and that my body feares to execute what my minde has ſo reſolutely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken!
Can I yet doubt whether I be to revenge my ſelfe, having run over
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7768:130"/>
ſo many Seas to finde the occaſion? No, no, let this cruell man feele the fury
of a woman juſtly provoked, and repay all the torments he has made me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.
She encourag'd thus her ſelfe, for to fortifie her heart that ſeem'd not
over much aſſured, and went her way towards <hi>Melintus,</hi> conducted by the
torches light, in deſigne to make him have a ſenſe of the death ſhee would
give him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> knew her preſently, and ſeeing that ſhe ſought him among the
ſhadowes, he would prevent her, and ſaid; Come, <hi>Emilia,</hi> that you bring
me is very agreeable to me. Thoſe words troubled her, becauſe this voyce
heretofore ſo loved, ſurpriz'd her; and ſhe thought not that <hi>Melintus</hi> could
know her, beleeving her dead, and ſeeing her in the habit ſhe was in. Ha!
traiterous Sorcerer, ſaid ſhe at length, what ſpirit hath learn'd thee that I am
<hi>Emilia?</hi> Yes, I am that <hi>Emilia,</hi> the object of thy contempts and thy ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
that am come from hell to raviſh from thee thy perfidious ſoule, and
abandon it to the furies. Well then, replied he gently, diſpatch, <hi>Emilia;</hi> doe
that you have enterpriz'd: behold my breſt uncover'd, ſtrike the ponyard
in, and aſſure your ſelfe that the death you are going to give me, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, not as a punition for having offended you, but as a recompence for
the good ſervice I have done you. Done me good ſervice! replied ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly.
Ha! Villaine, call'ſt thou that good ſervice, to have mocked at my
love, and to have rewarded my cares with diſdaine and ingratitude? call'ſt
thou that good ſervice, cruell man, when after thou hadſt eſcap'd from me by
ſubtilty; thou wouldſt no more thinke there remain'd an <hi>Emilia</hi> in the world,
to whom thou waſt ſo much oblig'd? call'ſt thou that good ſervice, thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
wretch; when neither the ſickneſſe that hapned to me for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
of ſeeing thee no more, nor my death ſo neare, nor my very death it ſelfe
could oblige thee to give one viſit to our houſe? <hi>Emilia,</hi> replied <hi>Melintus,</hi> to
what purpoſe ſerve theſe reproaches, ſince you are reſolv'd to make me dye?
Diſpatch, <hi>Emilia,</hi> ſee my breſt ready for you, give the blow, and beleeve
that you never yet oblig'd me ſo much; as you ſhall doe at this houre by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away my life. No, anſwered ſhe, I will know firſt, wherein, traytor,
thou haſt ſerv'd me. Ha! <hi>Emilia,</hi> ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> will you have me to your
ſhame preſent before your eyes ſo trouble ſome remembrances? Did I not
ſerve you well, when ſeeing that this ſame <hi>Emilia,</hi> whoſe wit and vertue I
had before admir'd, let her ſelfe looſe to deſires that were not very honeſt, I
endeuoured to aſſwage that heat by my coldneſſes, for feare ſhe ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
all her life time, the fault of a few dayes? Did I not ſerve you well,
when deploring with my ſelfe the wandring of your ſoule, and comparing
your abaſement with the honour of your preceding life, I was not willing
to take advantage at your blindneſſe, but maintain'd you, pure at leaſt from
ill effects, ſince I could not hinder the impurity of your deſires and thoughts?
And did I not well ſerve you, when ſeeing that my preſence rather kindled
your paſſion, than my reaſons had power to extinguiſh it, I tooke a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by ſubtlety to goe from you, hoping that by taking away the object that
carried you to impudicity, by little and little reaſon would be reſtor'd to
you, and make you know into what miſery you were ready to have fallen?
<hi>Emilia, Emilia,</hi> I had beene ſuch an one, as you would then have wiſhed
me, what ſhould you be at this houre? What repenting for having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7768:131"/>
ſo ſhamefull a fault? what remorſe would ſeize you at this preſent,
for having loſt that honour that heretofore became your front with ſo much
aſſurance? and to ſee your ſelfe conſtrain'd to hang downe your eyes, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
of your ſhame, and of your miſerie? What have I done to you then,
<hi>Emilia,</hi> to purſue me thus ſo furiouſly? You will make me dye, for being
cauſe that you may yet boaſt of your being honeſt; that you feare not the
reproaches, either of men, or of your owne conſcience, and that you find per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
yet that will enterpriſe all things for your ſake. See, <hi>Emilia,</hi> whether I
have done you good ſervice or no; and judge for the preſent, if I ſhould
have more oblig'd you by ſatsfying your deſire at that time, than by not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Emilia,</hi> in whom there ſtill remain'd ſeeds of vertue and a good courage,
was ſo touch'd at theſe true and ſenſible reproaches, and ſtood ſo full of
ſhame, as her furious and irregular paſſion, not able to ſuſtaine the force of
ſo great a vertue, forſooke her, and ſhe was conſtrain'd inſenſibly to let fall
the ponyard ſhe held. She continued ſilent a long time, not knowing what
to anſwer him: at laſt ſhe ſate downe by his ſide, and ſaid to him, <hi>Melintus</hi>
the wiſeſt of all men, thou haſt twice vanquiſh'd me: the firſt time thou gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt
but my heart and my affection; but now thou ſurmounteſt my ſoule,
and my very reaſon, that confeſſes there is no vertue in the world comparable
to thine. I ſubmit to all the paines thou wilt ordaine me, for the torments I
have made thee ſuffer; and I will confeſſe every where, that I am redeuable
to thee for the reſolution I take, to follow all my life time the advice of thy
marvellous wiſdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Emilia</hi> thus rendred due homage to the vertue of <hi>Melintus,</hi> when <hi>Trebatius</hi>
who had care of her, and feared that <hi>Melintus</hi> all fettered as he was, might
finde meanes to defend himſelfe from her, becauſe ſhe ſtayed long, came all
alone to finde her, and was in a great wonder to ſee her by <hi>Melintus,</hi> rather in
eſtate of a ſuppliant, than a perſon that ſought revenge. What's this? ſaid
he to <hi>Emilia,</hi> What doe I ſee? <hi>Trebatius,</hi> ſaies ſhe to him, you have reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to wonder: but if you had heard the ſage diſcourſes of <hi>Melintus,</hi> you
would be overcome as well as I am. See the moſt vertuous man of the world,
to whom I am beholding for the purity I have hitherto preſerv'd, and for the
vertue I ſhall follow all my life hereafter: I require you would ſave his life
for my ſake, or elſe put me to death in his ſtead. Madam, replied <hi>Trebatius,</hi>
you know I have not enterpris'd the ruine of <hi>Melintus,</hi> but to ſatisfie you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no cauſe at all to hate him. If you have admir'd his wiſdome for the
preſent, I have lately admir'd the greatneſſe of his courage and ſtrength; and
it was with much regret that I permitted you the deſtruction of ſo valiant a
man. <hi>Melintus</hi> brake off this diſcourſe, to tell them that hee had neither ſo
much vertue, nor ſo much courage; that what he had done againſt the <hi>Roman</hi>
ſouldiers, was rather an effect of deſpaire than valour, for having underſtood
that his friend was in danger of his life; and that <hi>Emilia</hi> called wiſdome in
him, the knowledge he had given her of the tranſport of her fury, which
made her doe things miſ-becomming her ſex: that ſince they had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from the Emperour to put him to death, they ſhould not for this refuſe
to doe it, for feare they themſelves ſuffer'd not for it. No, no, ſaid <hi>Emilia,</hi>
I will dye, before any ſuch thing happen to you from <hi>Trebatius;</hi> and I know
<pb facs="tcp:7768:131"/>
that he is not here, but to obey me. <hi>Trebatius</hi> confirm'd what ſhe had ſaid,
and then <hi>Melintus</hi> replied; Since you are willing, I have an obligation to
you for my life, I will acquit my ſelfe in ſome ſort towards you; counſelling
you, ſaid he addreſſing him to <hi>Emilia,</hi> to conſider for the preſent the merits
of <hi>Trebatius,</hi> his faithfull affection, and ſo many ſervices he hath done you,
which altogether oblige you to receive him for your husband. And you, ſaid
he turning him towards <hi>Trebatius,</hi> receive from my hand <hi>Emilia,</hi> whoſe faire
qualities you are not ignorant of, and who having let her ſelfe be ſurpriz'd
with the paſſion of revenge, ſhall from henceforth prove the vertuouſeſt
woman of the world, ſince ſhe has knowne how to overcome it. <hi>Emilia</hi> gave
her hand to <hi>Trebatius</hi> for <hi>Melintus</hi> ſake, and having permitted him to kiſſe it
for a pledge that ſhe receiv'd him as her husband, made him all-tranſported
with joy. <hi>Trebatius</hi> finding himſelfe ſo redeuable to <hi>Melintus,</hi> ask'd him, if
he deſir'd any other thing of him beſide. That you would deliver, anſwer'd
he, <hi>Palamede.</hi> He is no more in our power, ſaid <hi>Trebatius;</hi> and thereupon he
told him how <hi>Dicearchus</hi> had ſaved him, but that he had cauſed the old man
to be put in his place in a dungeon neare to that they were in, and that hee
was reſolv'd to have him dye for having dar'd to conceive ſuch an enterprize,
and that now he was the more perſwaded to it, becauſe he was <hi>Melintus</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Ha! <hi>Trebatius,</hi> ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> I demand of you then the life of <hi>Dicear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
in ſtead of <hi>Palamedes.</hi> Too-generous <hi>Melintus,</hi> replied <hi>Trebatius,</hi> if you
knew in what ſort he is incens'd againſt you, you would never deſire hee
ſhould live any longer. 'Tis no matter, ſaid <hi>Melintus,</hi> he is uncle to <hi>Ariana</hi>
and <hi>Palamede;</hi> and though he be very cruell to me, I will never endure to
have him dye. I give you his life then, and will have him hold it of none but
you. <hi>Melintus</hi> thank'd him for this favour; and then <hi>Emilia</hi> ask'd how hee
was able to ſave himſelfe in the City, while ſhe made the ſearch for him. He
anſwered her, that it was by the meanes of <hi>Arcas</hi> his free-man, who had put
himſelfe into their company being at <hi>Rome,</hi> and told her all hee had done
ſince to ſuccour <hi>Palamede</hi> and him being in <hi>Nicopolis:</hi> that they had ever bin
with <hi>Ariana</hi> and the reſt of their troop in the lodging hee had made to be
marked out for him; and thither without queſtion was <hi>Palamede</hi> retired.
<hi>Trebatius</hi> and <hi>Emilia</hi> highly commended the fidelity, and reſolution of this
freed-man, and <hi>Emilia</hi> that remembred what he had done heretofore at <hi>Rome</hi>
with <hi>Niſus,</hi> being a ſlave, when he attempted to dye for his Maſter; added,
that this was not the firſt time hee had ſhewne a great courage, and extreme
affection for him. <hi>Melintus</hi> interrupted this diſcourſe, to tell them, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his owne ſafety aſſured, and that of <hi>Dicearchus</hi> too, there remain'd no
more but to thinke upon <hi>Trebatius</hi> his; and this was it they were well to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for: for if the Emperour knew that he had let him eſcape, hee would
never pardon him. They conſider'd ſome time thereupon, then <hi>Melintus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied;
I am of opinion that to take away from thoſe are with you the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the favour you have done me, you were beſt to goe both of you
out from hence, as if you came from killing of me, and <hi>Dicearchus</hi> too, ſince
he is in a dungeon here hard by; and that you command all your ſouldiers,
and all that ſerve you, to goe ſeeke <hi>Palamede</hi> in all the ſhipping at the Port,
that ſo I may eſcape when all ſhall be gone out, and there be not any left that
may be a witneſſe of your letting me goe. You may tell them how <hi>Dicearchus</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:7768:132"/>
hoping to ſave his owne life by diſcovering his Nephew, declar'd to you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he died, that he had hid himſelfe in ſome ſhip or other. You may keepe
ſtill by you <hi>Arcas</hi> onely, for to ſerve you, and helpe my eſcape. <hi>Trebatius</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
of this advice, and reſolv'd to follow it: he went with <hi>Emilia</hi> out
of the dungeon whither they had deſcended, being followed by none, and
as ſoone as they were above and among the ſouldiers, <hi>Trebatius</hi> made as if
he were in a great heat, and ſaid that hee came from killing <hi>Melintus</hi> and
<hi>Dicearchus;</hi> but that he muſt have <hi>Palamede</hi> too, who was hidden at the port
in ſome of the Veſſels, and that <hi>Dicearchus</hi> had confeſt it before his death.
Inſtantly he commanded all his ſoulders to goe ſeeke him there, and forbad
them returning, till they had found him out. Hee met none in all the houſe
that he ſent not thither, feining to doe it out of a great paſſion to have <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamede</hi>
under his hands. He kept onely about him <hi>Arcas,</hi> who melted into
teares beleeving his Maſter was dead. But when they were alone, <hi>Treba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
commanded him to ſhut the doores, and bade him be comforted, for
his Maſter was ſtill living. <hi>Arcas</hi> was in a ſtrange amaze, that <hi>Trebatius</hi> knew
<hi>Melintus</hi> was his Maſter; and continued in a ſuſpenſe, not knowing if hee
were to beleeve that he was alive, and not able to imagine in what ſort <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batius</hi>
had underſtood any thing concerning him by <hi>Melintus:</hi> but <hi>Emilia</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
him by telling him how ſhe knew him, and how <hi>Melintus</hi> and they were
become friends. <hi>Arcas</hi> caſt himſelfe at their feet for exceſſe of joy to give
them thanks, and preſently they went away together to the dungeon to have
<hi>Melintus</hi> out. This poore free-man ſeeing by the Torch-light that <hi>Emilia</hi> had
left his Maſter, who reach'd out his armes to him, thought to have dyed for
joy to ſee him yet living; and in teſtimony of his extreme ſatisfaction, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
the irons off his feet: at the ſame time <hi>Trebatius</hi> and <hi>Emilia</hi> tooke him
on both ſides for to lift him up, and becauſe his feet were ſtiffe and benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
they would needs ſuſtaine him, untill he came into the Court of the
houſe, and could goe alone; and they led him thus, as it were triumphing
over the rage they had before conceiv'd againſt him. When he ſaw himſelfe
in caſe to goe freely, he would take his leave of them, and prayed them, that
they would ſend away <hi>Dicearchus</hi> after him: but <hi>Emilia</hi> deſir'd to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him with <hi>Trebatius</hi> to his lodging, becauſe ſhe was deſirous to ſee <hi>Ariana,</hi>
and entreat her pardon for the troubles ſhe had made her ſuffer, in purſuing
the death of him ſhe loved. <hi>Melintus</hi> prayed them not to take this trouble
upon themſelves, for feare ſome body might ſee them together in the City,
and this occaſion make <hi>Trebatius</hi> be accuſed. Shee anſwer'd that they were
but to put every one a caſque upon their head, with the vizard downe, and ſo
they would not be diſcover'd: that <hi>Arcas</hi> ſhould goe in the meane time to
fetch <hi>Dicearchus</hi> out of the dungeon, and bring him away with his chaines
and all to their lodging; that he might receive the grace of his life of none
but <hi>Melintus.</hi> This contentment muſt be given to the deſire <hi>Emilia</hi> had to
ſee <hi>Ariana</hi> againe, and make a friendſhip with her. They put each of them a
caſque upon their heads, and went out, after they had given charge to <hi>Arcas</hi>
to goe deliver <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> and bring him bound as he was to the lodging they
were going to.</p>
               <p>They found the ſtreets empty of people, for the greateſt part had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the ſouldiers to the Port out of curioſity, to ſee what they went to doe
<pb facs="tcp:7768:132"/>
there: ſo as they were ſeene but of a few, till they came to the houſe they
went to. <hi>Ariana</hi> and <hi>Cyllenia</hi> were in a great fright, when they knew that three
armed men demanded entrance. <hi>Palamede</hi> who was already in deſperation
for not knowing what was become of his friend, was reſolv'd to eaſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments
by revenging himſelfe on theſe three men whom he judg'd to be
<hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers; and after he had armed him with <hi>Lepantus,</hi> he commanded
they ſhould open and let them enter. <hi>Melintus</hi> went firſt, and was amaz'd to
ſee himſelfe in an inſtant aſſail'd by <hi>Palamede:</hi> he perceiv'd the error of his
friend, yet he was conſtrain'd to take his ſword in hand, for to ward the blows
he gave him; at laſt taking his time he lift up his vizor, and in ſpeaking made
himſelfe knowne to him. <hi>Palamede</hi> preſently threw away his ſword, and caſt
himſelfe at his feet to demand pardon of him. <hi>Melintus</hi> imbrac'd him, and
lifting him up, ſaid that he would yet more wonder, when he knew who they
were that accompanied him. <hi>Trebatius</hi> and <hi>Emilia</hi> advanced then the viſiere
of their Caſques; whereat <hi>Palamede</hi> had a like aſtoniſhment, as if he had ſeene
enchantments. <hi>Lepantus</hi> that knew them not, rejoyc'd onely to ſee <hi>Melintus</hi>
alive, and ran inſtantly to advertiſe <hi>Ariana</hi> and <hi>Cyllenia</hi> of this good newes.
At the ſame time <hi>Melintus</hi> entred into the Chamber, and <hi>Ariana</hi> came to
receive him with open armes, and could not ſpeake a good while, ſo tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
was ſhe with joy. <hi>Trebatius</hi> and <hi>Emilia</hi> ſaluted her after that, and ſhe was
ſo confounded for what ſhe ſaw, and heard them ſpeake, that they were to
give her ſome time for to be aſſured that it was no dreame. Teares of joy
flowed every where abundantly to ſee ſo fortunate a change. <hi>Trebatius</hi> and
<hi>Emilia</hi> made them many excuſes, and endevoured to have them forget their
miſeries by the continuall kindneſſes they ſhewed them. At length <hi>Melintus</hi>
ſaid, that nothing now remain'd, but to have <hi>Dicearchus.</hi> Preſently after he
entred all laden with fetters, <hi>Arcas</hi> holding him behind; and being brought
before them, he was in a great wonder, when he lift up his eyes and ſaw <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,
Ariana,</hi> and <hi>Palamede</hi> beſides <hi>Trebatius,</hi> with well-pleas'd countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
He could not imagine what ſuch a change as that meant: but hee was
much more confounded when <hi>Trebatius</hi> ſaid to him; Old man, you had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
death rather than any of theſe perſons here, for having corrupted my
men in my owne houſe, and I had ordain'd you to puniſhment; but I was
conſtrain'd to give your life to the intreaty of <hi>Melintus</hi> the moſt vertuous of
men; and from henceforth you hold it of none but him. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> was all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſham'd,
once againe to have an obligation for his life to a perſon whoſe
death he proſecuted: but <hi>Melintus</hi> knowing his diſorder, would comfort him,
and went to embrace him; then putting one knee to the ground, he began to
undoe his irons, and ask'd him pardon for having given him much diſpleaſure
in that he was forced by his love to carry away his Neece. <hi>Ariana</hi> at the ſame
time was upon her knees before her uncle, and deſir'd his favour for the fault
ſhe had made in going away from <hi>Corinth;</hi> and it was an action that drew
teares from the aſſiſtants, to ſee a captive at the ſame time ſuppliant, and
ſought to, and that the ſame perſons demanded grace, and gave it. <hi>Dicearchus</hi>
weeping alſo, could not tell what to ſay to them; only he embrac'd one while
<hi>Melintus,</hi> another while <hi>Ariana.</hi> At laſt <hi>Trebatius</hi> ſaid to him, that he ſhould
receive <hi>Melintus</hi> for the husband of <hi>Ariana,</hi> and for the moſt apparent hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
that could arrive to his family: that he himſelfe acknowledg'd him
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7768:133"/>
to be the moſt valiant &amp; moſt vertuous man of the earth; &amp; that he wondred
how he could poſſibly have ſuch animoſity untill then, againſt a perſon of ſo
admirable qualities. Live, ſayes he, from henceforth, happy together, being
oblig'd to one another by many important ſervices; and make much of the
repoſe that fortune ſends you. The embraces then redoubled, in teſtimony
that they confirm'd the advice of <hi>Trebatius;</hi> and a little after they conſulted
what they had to doe. <hi>Trebatius</hi> ſaid he would goe to finde his ſouldiers that
were ſtill ſearching <hi>Palamede</hi> in the Veſſels, to whom he reſolv'd to ſay that
<hi>Palamede</hi> had beene found in the City, and put to death: that at the very
houre he would embarke them, and returne to <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Emilia,</hi> in whoſe
company he hoped to paſſe away his dayes happily. As for them, he counſell'd
them, as well for their owne ſafety as his, to change their names, and retire
to ſome part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> where the Emperour ſhould never heare more of them:
beſides, they ought not to retire them to places commanded by the <hi>Roman</hi>
Governours, but into ſome Kings dominions, either of <hi>Troas,</hi> or <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gena.</hi>
Theſe advices having beene approv'd, they tooke leave one of another with a
thouſand embracings, and as many wiſhes that they might live all of them in
proſperity and repoſe the reſt of their dayes.</p>
               <p>Nothing now remain'd but to finde out <hi>Epicharis,</hi> and they judged that ſhe
had return'd to the firſt lodging they were in; becauſe ſhe knew not they had
changed it; but there ſhe was not to be found: nevertheleſſe the day after
having knowne that <hi>Trebatius</hi> was departed with all his troop, they would
remove againe into that lodging, which was very great, ſtaying untill they
might heare newes of her, and ſent the faithfull <hi>Arcas</hi> who remain'd amongſt
them, to have brought thither what they had tranſported into the other
houſe; to the end they might in that place celebrate the marriage of <hi>Melintus</hi>
with <hi>Ariana,</hi> and <hi>Lepantus</hi> with <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> which had ſo cruelly beene deferred;
but now was reſolv'd on by the very conſent of <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> who was ſo aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for being ſo many times redeuable to <hi>Melintus,</hi> that he could hardly lift
up his eyes before him. <hi>Palamede</hi> in the meane time went to the bay where
the veſſell was hid, for to have it returne, and to ſee if <hi>Epicharis</hi> were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the Sea-coaſt ſomewhere: but all his care proved unprofitable. That ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day they tooke out of the ſhip all they thought neceſſary for them, to goe
away by land as farre as the Helleſpont, and from thence to paſſe into <hi>Aſia;</hi>
becauſe the way was much ſhorter, and withall they were in hope to finde
<hi>Epicharis.</hi> Afterwards they ſent away the Veſſell to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> with charge to
goe ſecretly advertiſe at the houſes of <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> of <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Telephus,</hi>
what fortune they had met with; and to bring them all the commodities
they could get together out of their eſtates, to the end they might be able to
live in <hi>Troas,</hi> where they would ſettle; and that thoſe were ſent to them
ſhould come the ſame way they went, not to faile of encountring them: they
gave marks alſo whereby they ſhould be found, and inſtructions concerning
all they had to doe.</p>
               <p>About evening, when every one re-began the preparations for the next
day, they were told, there had beene in that houſe ſome dayes a ſicke wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that was landed at that place, and appear'd very venerable. They had
the curioſity to goe ſee her and offer her what aſſiſtance they were able; but
when they were entred into the Chamber, and came neare her bed, ſhe cried
<pb facs="tcp:7768:133"/>
out having perceiv'd <hi>Dicearchus;</hi> Ha ye gods! Who preſents this hangman
to me, this traitor? and continued a thouſand outrageous ſpeeches againſt
him, in ſuch ſort as they thought her ſickneſſe was ſome burning fever; and
having recommended her to thoſe that waited on her, they left her. A little
while after, <hi>Dicearchus</hi> by chance repaſſed by this womans Chamber, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
afreſh her injuries and maledictions, made her ſelfe at laſt knowne to
him, to be the ſage <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> wife of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> and mother of <hi>Melintus.
Dicearchus</hi> then full of confuſion to finde himſelfe guilty of all the miſeries
that had hapned to <hi>Hermocrates</hi> and her, knew not what to doe with himſelfe,
whether he regarded her, or return'd towards <hi>Melintus,</hi> whoſe ſight he could
not endure, for having ſo much offended him, and for being ſo oblig'd to
him. At laſt he reſolv'd to goe nearer, and he ſaid to her, that in ſatisfaction
of ſo many miſeries and diſpleaſures he had brought upon her, hee thought
himſelfe happy for having a meanes to give her as much contentment now
preſently, as before he had given her troubles and griefes. <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to judge what he meant to ſay, ask'd him, if hee would not ſtill continue
his deceits and treaſons, and aſſur'd him, that the gods would one day revenge
her for all his villanies. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> fail'd not to goe out, and finding <hi>Melintus</hi>
he ſaid to him with a heart touch'd by repentance, that he eſteem'd himſelfe
at laſt very happy for having found out in his misfortune, wherewith to pay
him in part for ſo many obligations he had to him; not onely in granting him
<hi>Ariana</hi> for his wife, but alſo in making him an ineſtimable preſent, for
which without doubt he would be extremely joyfull. <hi>Melintus</hi> having given
him thanks, and not able to imagine what he could give him, let himſelfe be
conducted by him into the Chamber where <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> was, to whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<hi>Melintus</hi> for her ſonne, and ſaid to <hi>Melintus,</hi> that he gave him <hi>Euphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyne</hi>
for his mother, and that he rejoyc'd for that the gods had offered him
this meanes to give them ſatisfaction. <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> and <hi>Melintus</hi> knew not yet
if they ſhould beleeve it or no, and continued ſilent and aſtoniſhed. No, no,
replied <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> never doubt of what I tell you. <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> knowes who
ſhe is, and for you, ſayes he to <hi>Melintus,</hi> open your breſt to her, that ſhée
may ſee the marke of the heart, which will aſſure her that you are her ſonne.
<hi>Melintus</hi> ſhewed her that marke, and then <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> ſaid, opening her arms;
Ha my ſonne, is it you indeed, whoſe ſight I have ſo longed after? and
whom I could never heare any newes of? Ha <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> how from my
heart I pardon you all the torments you have made me ſuffer, and if <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
were with us, how happy ſhould I eſteeme my ſelfe for the preſent. At
the ſame time a ſtreame of teares bedewed her face all over. <hi>Melintus</hi> had his
heart ſo preſſed, to feele himſelfe embrac'd by this vertuous mother, whoſe
loſſe he had ſo often lamented, that he could not be at eaſe but in letting fall
alſo many teares. This object ſo tender, and ſo pittifull, mixt with regrets
and ſatisfactions, with ſorrow and joy, could not be ſeene but with weeping,
which ſerv'd for two uſes, being capable to repreſent both the reſentments of
griefe, and the exceſſes of contentment. <hi>Melintus</hi> preſented afterwards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi>
to his mother; and having told her a part of her vertues, and of their
adventures, let her know that ſhe was deſtin'd to be his wife, if ſhee were
pleas'd withall. Then they embrac'd one another with much tranſportation;
and <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> ſaid, that after ſo much happineſſe, ſhe had nothing to be ſorry
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:7768:134"/>
for but the loſſe of <hi>Hermocrates. Melintus</hi> expreſs'd to her that his greateſt
deſire was to know what their fortune had beene ſince their exile from <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,</hi>
and in what ſort ſhe had encountred in that place. She let them know
that ſhe was very willing to give them this contentment, beleeving now ſhe
had ſtrengh enough to performe it; but <hi>Dicearchus</hi> foreſeeing how that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
could not be made, but that he muſt receive the ſtings of many a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
withdrew himſelfe with <hi>Palamede,</hi> leaving <hi>Melintus, Ariana, Lepan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> in preparation to hearken to <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> who began thus her
diſcourſe, holding <hi>Melintus</hi> by the hand.</p>

                  <head>Hiſtory of Hermocrates and Euphroſyne.</head>
                  <p>MY deare ſonne, if you deſire to know the originall of our misfortunes,
and what the great <hi>Hermocrates</hi> your father hath beene, I muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
take up my diſcourſe ſomething from afarre off, for to let you ſee that
at what time I married him, fortune never brought together any couple that
had cauſe to expect more happineſſe, and yet proved ſo unfortunate as wee.
Under the reigne of the Emperour <hi>Tiberius, Hermocrates</hi> (of whoſe illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
birth I will make no relation to you, becauſe I beleeve you are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of it) would goe to <hi>Rome</hi> being very young. His father and mother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no other child but him, were in trouble to have him ſo farre remov'd
out of their ſight: but in the end he obtained leave. As ſoone as hee was at
<hi>Rome,</hi> he ſtayed not long to put himſelfe into the acquaintance of the great
Prince <hi>Germanicus,</hi> who then was the refuge of what ever there was vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
upon earth. <hi>Hermocrates</hi> that was perfect in all kinds of excellent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and among others had a wiſdome and a valour to be admired, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
lov'd of him; and a while after the occaſion of the <hi>German</hi> warres was
preſented, wherein he followed that Prince, and made ſo many proofes of
his valiance, and prudent government, that he gave him great commands in
the Army, and honour'd him divers times with many crownes, and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
praiſes. After theſe warres were finiſhed, he return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> with
<hi>Germanicus,</hi> and admiring the vertue of this great Prince, he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
him: <hi>Germanicus</hi> on the other ſide, loving <hi>Hermocrates</hi> dearely, gave
him cauſe enough not to abandon him; and knowing his nobleneſſe, and his
vertues, beleev'd that he alone was worthy of his friendſhip. They were a
long time in this ſort inſeparable; and if the gods willing to puniſh the earth
by the cruell Emperours they gave ſince, had not ſo ſoone taken out of the
world this lovely Prince, whom by a juſt title they call'd the delights of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
kinde, I beleeve I ſhould never have knowne <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> nor beene to
him the cauſe of all his miſeries. But <hi>Germanicus</hi> having beene poyſoned by
<hi>Piſo</hi> and <hi>Plancinus</hi> in <hi>Syria, Hermocrates</hi> could not endure to ſee <hi>Rome</hi> any
more, where there was an Emperour ſo execrable, who envying the vertue
of his Nephew, and the love that all the world had to him, had cruelly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
him of his life; ſo as he return'd to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> but with ſuch a regret for
the death of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> that his ſadneſſe appeared viſibly upon his face, and
made him be affected the more by others to ſee him faithfull to a Prince ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
of the world. At that time was I one of the moſt conſiderable of
<hi>Syracuſe,</hi> although I were not originary of that Countrey: but the Nobility
<pb facs="tcp:7768:134"/>
of my birth was well enough knowne; for that my grand-fathers that went
out of <hi>Carthage</hi> when it was deſtroyed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> were of the race of the
Princes <hi>Hamilcar</hi> and <hi>Hannibal;</hi> and therewithall I had an eſtate, if I may ſay
it, equall to my Nobility, and my mother onely was left me of my kindred,
all whoſe cares tended to the choyce of ſome party that might be for my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dicearchus</hi> (many ages ſince deſcended of <hi>Timoleon,</hi> and having a ſufficient
eſtate to ſuſtaine the ranke that his birth gave him,) was one of the chiefe that
preſented themſelves. He was wanting in no care or practice, for to order
his affaires ſo as he might marry me, and labour'd by a thouſand wayes to give
my mother great impreſſions of his honeſty, for he knew her to be of ſo great
a vertue, that he well ſaw ſhe would be impregnable any other way but this.
But <hi>Hermocrates</hi> arriving at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> obtained without thinking what the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tried to gaine by a thouſand ſubtilties: for every one being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
prevented with his great reputation, it was acknowledg'd not to be
without cauſe, that renowne had ſo high advanc'd him, becauſe his Nobility
was accompanied with ſo many vertues, and he added to his other good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
ſo honeſt a modeſty, with a ſadneſſe that was ſtill more gracefull in him,
that there was not a perſon but bare a love and reſpect towards him.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time having beene bred under the government of the wiſeſt
mother in the world, I made my ſelfe alſo ſufficiently eſteem'd by a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
I obſerved, endevouring to imitate her vertue, and give her all the
contentments ſhe could expect from a daughter. I know not what it was
<hi>Hermocrates</hi> ſaw in me that pleaſed him, whether appearance of vertue, or
ſome other thing, but he expreſs'd with a great grace and reſpect the deſigne
he had to ſerve me. As for me, who had no deſire to make a choyce, but
would leave my ſelfe to my mothers judgement, I alwayes feined not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what he would ſay to me: but for all that I was not ſorry when he
came neare me, and I tooke the paines to entertaine him with the beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
I was able. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> was not in that eſteeme with me; becauſe I
knew him to be a violent and an artificiall man, and I judged that his humor
would never agree well with mine. My mother ſoone perceiv'd the purpoſe
of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> and was well content therewithall; ſo as ſhe was never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
that he ſhould ſpeake to me, and the firſt time he found the occaſion
to come to our houſe, ſhe aſſur'd him that the entrance to it ſhould ever be
open for him. He receiv'd this permiſſion with a great deale of reſpect, and
made very diſcreet uſe thereof: but <hi>Dicearchus</hi> could not ſuffer to ſee a rivall
ſo well intreated, and to finde himſelfe ſo diſtant from our good graces; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
that he was not ſo removed but by the advancement of <hi>Hermocrates.</hi>
He had recourſe to a thouſand devices, and at laſt counterfetted a letter,
which he ſent to my mother, as if <hi>Eryx</hi> (who was <hi>Hermocrates</hi> father) had
written it to her; wherein he advertis'd her not to receive any more his
ſonne at her houſe, and that he had other deſignes for him; that if ſhee of
her owne accord hindred not thoſe frequent viſits of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> hee ſhould
himſelfe be forc'd to doe it by a meanes that would be heard with no very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
noyſe to her. See what a crafty plot here was: ſee my mother then
in a great wonder, and more offended withall. As ſoone as <hi>Hermocrates</hi> came
to ſee her, ſhe prayed him to come no more at her houſe: nevertheleſſe with
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7768:135"/>
ſo much temper, as ſhe expreſs'd no diſcontentment at all to him, beleeving
that he had no part in what his father had written to her. <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
my mother us'd him with no diſcourteſie, was yet in a great ſurprize,
and beſought her an hundred times to tell him what fault he could commit
againſt the reſpect he ought us. She would reveale nothing of the matter to
him; but in the end ſhe told him that <hi>Eryx</hi> was not well pleas'd with their
friendſhip. He confeſs'd that his father indeed had propos'd a marriage for
him, but that it was a thing ſo unlikely, that he beleev'd verily he thought no
more of it. No, no, <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> replied ſhe, he has forbidden me by writing
to receive you here any more: but I thinke he might have expreſs'd his aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to us by ſomething a civiller way. Ha, Madam, ſayes he, is it poſſible, this
you tell me? 'Tis ſo true, anſwer'd ſhe, that without oppoſing his deſire, or
my owne honour, I can no longer ſuffer you in this houſe. Then he went his
way, overcome with diſpleaſure, and not knowing how hee ſhould make
ſhift to live any more; becauſe that as hee had a great reſpect and love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his father, ſo he had alſo as great a reſentment of the injury he thought
he had receiv'd from him, in ſuch ſort that piety and choler began a combat
in his ſoule which gave him no repoſe at all. When he was at home, he durſt
not lift up his eyes upon <hi>Eryx,</hi> for feare of offending him with an ill looke;
for it had beene impoſſible for him to ſee him without paine. He would not
wiſh his father any evill, and yet he could not deſire any good to him: ſo as
having liv'd ſome time in this trouble of ſpirit he could not rid himſelfe of,
at laſt he fell ſicke, and the more care <hi>Eryx</hi> expreſs'd to have of him, the
more did his ſickneſſe increaſe. This good father full of griefe to ſee in that
danger his ſonne whom he had reaſon to cheriſh, as well for the lovelineſſe of
his perſon, as becauſe he was the onely one he bad, who for all this gave no
comfort to his ſorrow, not enduring the ſight of him, and refuſing from his
hand the remedies he offered him, knew not whence this averſion ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
of his ſonne towards him, and ſhed teares abundantly. <hi>Hermocrates</hi> on
the other ſide ſeeing his father in that perplexity, accuſed himſelfe for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious
ſonne ſo to torment his owne father; and could not tell whether he
ſhould wiſh himſelfe dead or alive, well knowing that if he dyed, he ſhould
but heape ſorrowes and anguiſhes upon the old age of thoſe that brought him
into the world, and by living he could expect no contentment from them,
nor give them any. But at length <hi>Eryx</hi> prayed his wife to aske him what
cauſe he had not to love him, and if ever he had given him any occaſion to
be diſpleaſed with him; that having receiv'd of the gods a ſonne ſo vertuous
and obedient, hee ſhould thinke himſelfe very ingrate towards them, and
himſelfe too, if ever it ſhould happen that he gave him any diſpleaſure. His
mother labour'd to get this ſecret out of him, but he could never be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to accuſe his father; and hee was reſolv'd rather to dye, than a word
ſhould eſcape him that ſhewed any want of reſpect. She forced her ſelfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times to make him declare his griefe, which ſhe doubted he concealed,
though ſhe knew no cauſe he had for it; but it was impoſſible to draw any
thing from him. In the end this good father outraged with affliction, could
no longer containe himſelfe; but approaching his ſonnes bed, he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
on his knees before him, and full of teares prayed him to tell him if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he had diſpleas'd him in any thing. <hi>Hermocrates</hi> aſhamed at this ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb facs="tcp:7768:135"/>
and beleeving he received an injury rather than an honour by it, knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him downe upon his bed, and bowing towards his father, deſired him as
he embrac'd him, to riſe up, and not make his pitty guilty of ſhame, by an
abaſement unworthy of him. No, ſayes <hi>Eryx</hi> to him, I will never riſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
you have told me wherein I have given you diſpleaſure. Ha my father,
ſayes he, muſt I have beene ſo unfortunate, as not to have inviolably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
all your deſires? and that my affections ſhould be repugnant unto
yours? What would you ſay, replied <hi>Eryx,</hi> ſpeake more clearely, my ſonne;
for I doe not think you have ever oppos'd the thing I deſi'rd of you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
I promiſe you never to be contrary to any thing you ſhall deſire of mee.
No, no, father, anſwer'd <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> be well aſſured, I will never be diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to you, and I ſhall take order with my ſelfe for your ſake, for ever
thinking upon <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> but. Then he made a ſtop, and his father ſaid to
him; Goe on, ſonne, and feare not to tell me what you deſire: you ſhall
learne me what I know not yet, and peradventure what I ſhall as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
as your ſelfe. Ha! father, ſayes <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> if it be lawfull for mee
to put a reproach upon you, your letter made no ſuch expreſſion that you
would deſire it. What letter? anſwered he. But not to ſeeme troubleſome
to you, continued <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> the good father knew at laſt, there had beene
ſent to my mother as from him, a ſuppoſititious letter; and without any
more delay he comes to our houſe, and intreated my mother to ſhew it him,
and told her it muſt have beene ſent by ſome ſpirit that was very neare to
have ruin'd his ſonnes life. When he had ſeene it, he expreſs'd in ſuch ſort
that he was innocent of this letter, and made her ſo many ſatisfactions, that
ſhe could have no ſuſpition at all of him, and made it appeare that ſhee had
much ſorrow for <hi>Hermocrates</hi> ſickneſſe, whom ſhe greatly eſteemed her ſelfe.
And for this cauſe they concluded together our marriage before they parted;
and imagining from whence this letter ſhould come, they conceiv'd it muſt
be from <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> who ſince that time had expreſs'd a greater paſſion to
me than ever before. See then how <hi>Dicearchus</hi> willing to hinder our marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
advanc'd it: aſſembling together by his owne invention, thoſe that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
would have had much adoe to have effected it. As ſoone as <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
learn'd this good newes, it ſeem'd they had reſtor'd him his life, and
we went oft to viſit him untill he was perfectly recovered. Then were wee
married together with a thouſand rejoycings, and paſſed away three or foure
yeeres with all the contentments can be imagined, without having yet any
children. In the meane time <hi>Dicearchus</hi> not able to endure that our marriage
ſhould be made while he were at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> was gone to <hi>Corinth,</hi> where he
ſtayed about two yeares, at the end whereof he return'd into <hi>Sicily</hi> with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidalia</hi>
whom he had married. Preſently after he declar'd himſelfe enemy to
<hi>Hermocrates,</hi> who having then loſt his father, ſeem'd to hold the firſt place
in the City; he practis'd the factious men on all ſides, to make a league a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and ſeem'd to have no other end in all his actions than to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
and ruine him, if it were poſſible. At laſt hee ſought out ſo many
meanes to attaine his deſigne, that there was one that ſucceeded to his wiſh.
You know, it may be, purſues <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> how he made armes be carried by
night over the wals of our houſe, and ranged them as in a readineſſe for an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion:
at the ſame time he went to advertiſe the chiefe of the City that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7768:136"/>
                     <hi>Hermocrates</hi> projected to make himſelfe a Tyrant, and that it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
at his houſe. They came to our houſe that very night, and raviſh'd
from my armes my deare <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> for to carry him away priſoner.
You may judge what trouble I was then ſurpriz'd in: nevertheleſſe in this
calamity I receiv'd ſome conſolation for the innocency of my husband;
and when <hi>Dicearchus</hi> friends ſolicited on that ſide to have him condemn'd
to dye, I did all I could to make the villany of that artifice appeare, and
what appearance there could be, that a private man would make himſelfe
Tyrant over a Citie that was of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. But all I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
was to moderate the condemnation to a baniſhment for five yeares,
and to have fifteene dayes given us to order our affaires in. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
that time ſerv'd but to increaſe our miſery: for <hi>Dicearchus</hi> having
knowne that we were to retire to <hi>Carthage,</hi> the place of my originall, and
not content with our baniſhment, had leiſure to practiſe certaine Pyrats,
who covenanted with him for a great ſumme of money that they would
ſurprize us in our paſſage from <hi>Lylibeum</hi> to <hi>Carthage;</hi> and after that they
would goe and ſell us apart to ſome Barbarians, for feare we ſhould ever ſee
one another againe, or returne into our Countrey; and becauſe I was
very big with childe at the ſame time, hee made them promiſe him to
put to death whatever ſhould be borne of mee, untill wee came to be ſold.
After wee had committed the managing of our eſtate to <hi>Diocles</hi> our friend
for to adminiſter it during the five yeares baniſhment, wee departed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with <hi>Telephus,</hi> not knowing the miſeries <hi>Dicearchus</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for us: but I was ſo happy as to be brought to bed of you at <hi>Lylibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
ſaid <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> to <hi>Melintus,</hi> where I ſtayed more than fifteene dayes
till I could endure the Sea; and it ſeemed you were willing to be borne
at that time, to retard as much as you could poſſibly, the miſeries that were
to happen to your parents. We happily advis'd to leave you ſecretly in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi>
and give you to <hi>Telephus;</hi> for if we had carried you away with us,
you had not beene alive at this houre: then tooke we leave of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
all in teares, and went to goe aboard the Veſſell: But there befell me
a miſchance that was an augury that this voyage ſhould prove very dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to us: for thinking to enter into the ſhip, my foot ſlipt, and I fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea: the affection of <hi>Hermocrates</hi> was ſuch, as hee threw himſelfe
preſently after me, ind by ſwimming ſaved me, and brought me aboard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
After we had dried us a while, we ſtayed not our departing, and
becauſe the paſſage is but ſhort, wee ſoone perceiv'd a light veſſell that
had parted from the coaſts, which in a ſmall time ſet upon us. <hi>Hermocrates</hi>
judged them to be Sea-courſers, and intreated thoſe that were with him,
to take armes and defend themſelves as well as they might. But their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was but ſmall, and beſides they were not in ſtate to fight, never expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
they ſhould have beene fought with in the ſmall way they had to paſſe.
Yet for all that they were not wanting to defend themſelves courageouſly,
and <hi>Hermocrates</hi> was not taken untill he had laid ſix of them at his feet.
His valour was eſteemed of the Pyrats, who in conſideration of him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
thoſe that were with us, and taking what they found beſt out of our
ſhip, made us enter into theirs. After they had paſſed us a good way on
the Sea, they brought us to a place of their owne retreat; and it was
<pb facs="tcp:7768:136"/>
ſtrange to ſee what fidelity theſe Pyrats kept with <hi>Dicearchus</hi> in that they
had promiſed him; becauſe they might have expected a greater ranſome from
us, than that they had receiv'd of him, and yet in the meane time they failed
not in what they had ſworne to him. Nevertheleſſe they ſhewed us ſome
favour, for we liv'd in honour among them, and accommodated with all
things neceſſary. They delayed three whole yeares to ſell us, during which
I was brought to bed of two children whom they put to death as they had
reſolved; afterwards they went to ſell my husband into a Countrey very
farre remov'd. As for me they were minded to keepe me ſtill by them,
what requeſt ſoever I made not to be ſeparate from <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> becauſe
they had brought me a Kings ſonne very young to breed up, whom they
had taken in ſome place or other; and on whom all my affection was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
being comforted by the nurture was committed to me for our cruell
captivity and dead children, attending the change of fortune. Theſe cruell
people were never touched, neither with the ſupplications and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
promiſes of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> nor yet with my teares, but in ſpight of mee
they carried him away to a place where now I beleeve he has ended his daies.
All my entertainment and conſolation in the cruell vexations I endur'd, was
in the nurcing I had of the little Prince which was called <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> who
alſo bare me a great affection, and as he grew gave teſtimonies not onely
of the greatneſſe of his extraction, but of a minde very generous alſo. When
he ſaw me afflicted, he labour'd to appeaſe me, and comforted me by the
hope he gave, that as ſoone as he had any power, he would reſtore my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and endevour to diſcover where <hi>Hermocrates</hi> was, that he might be
mine againe. Nevertheleſſe when he had the command over all the Pyrats,
he could not ſo ſoone effect what he had promis'd me, being retain'd from
doing it, for not offending their lawes. About a yeare ſince, deſirous to goe
to Sea, he promis'd me that I ſhould goe with him: but I fell ſo ſicke that it
was impoſſible for me. Some dayes ſince he return'd for to aſſemble all the
Pyraticke forces with a deſigne to goe upon ſome great enterprize, whence
fearing never to returne, and willing to deliver me, the Pyrats never know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, he intreated one called <hi>Amyntas</hi> that was come to finde him in a
Squiffe from ſome of his friends, to ſave me ſecretly with himſelfe when hee
return'd hither to finde out thoſe perſons he ſought for. This <hi>Amyntas</hi> had a
care of me as if I had beene his mother, and brought mee into this City,
where not encountring thoſe he thought to have found, he left me with the
people you ſee, for to ſerve and accompany me unto <hi>Syracuſe: Amyntas</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Eurymedon</hi> was here hard by for to aſſiſt thoſe he was in paine for, is
gone to finde him, and I beleeve they are gone away together, having heard
no newes at all of them. As for me attending the recovery of the ſickneſſe is
fallen upon me, and the labour I endur'd in my flight, I made a ſtay in this
lodging, where I was in a great wonder to ſee this ſame <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> the author
of all our diſpleaſures, all whoſe wicked practices I learned of <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> and
to whom for all this I cannot wiſh ill, ſince he hath reſtor'd me my deare <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi>
and makes me conceive ſome hope, being become our friend, that hee
will helpe us to finde <hi>Hermocrates</hi> your father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> thus ended, and <hi>Melintus</hi> told her how they knew who <hi>Euryme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
and <hi>Amyntas</hi> were, and that he hoped very ſoone by meanes of <hi>Euryme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:7768:137"/>
to learne what was become of his father; wherein he would employ all
the diligence he could poſſibly uſe. He entreated afterwards this vertuous
mother of his, to pardon <hi>Dicearchus</hi> for his deare <hi>Ariana's</hi> ſake, which ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
him, and they embrac'd one another with much affection. He told her
then the greateſt part of what had happened to them, and among other things
the faithfull friendſhip of <hi>Telephus,</hi> and the infidelity of <hi>Diocles,</hi> and how hee
had beene knowne for the ſonne of <hi>Hermocrates.</hi> Then theſe diſcourſes being
ended, every one retir'd to goe to bed, and to attend with repoſe the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and joyes of the next day.</p>

whom <hi>Epicharis</hi> loſſe gave no repoſe to, would not loſe the time
he might employ in ſearch of her: hee tooke a horſe and rode
out of <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> and went into all places thereabouts to ſee if ſhe
might not be retir'd ſomewhere out of the Towne. In vaine
he ſpent all the evening in this ſearch, and a great part of the night that was
very darke, and as he return'd towards the City, he heard two men on horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe
comming to him, who ſpake of <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Ariana,</hi> expreſſing a great
deale of angry malice againſt them. He could not know who they were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the obſcurity was ſo great as he did not ſo much as ſee them. But when
they were paſt, he had a minde to know more of their ſecrets; and after he
had tyed his horſe to a tree, he overtooke them on foot as ſpeedily as might
be: then going a light pace by them without making himſelfe be heard, he
liſtned their diſcourſe ſome while, not able yet to underſtand any thing: but
in the end one of the two replied thus: What? have I brought from <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi>
with ſuch reſpect and care, this traiterous and perjurious old man? have
I ſo long courted him at <hi>Corinth?</hi> and ſince followed him through all the
ports of <hi>Greece</hi> for to revenge his injuries? and now he is ſatisfied himſelfe,
ſhall he take no care whether I be ſo too or no? <hi>Palamede</hi> knew then by this
diſcourſe, and by the voyce, that it was <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> who went on: And ſhall
I ſuffer <hi>Melintus</hi> to marry her that is promis'd me, whoſe love brings ſo many
deſires and unquietneſſes upon me? Shall they goe away together contented,
and leave me here full of deſpite, of ſhame, of rage? In the meane time muſt
I appeare without heart, and not make them feele what a man of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is able to doe, betrayed on this faſhion, and wanting no reſentment?
No, no, though they have eſcaped the hands of <hi>Trebatius,</hi> they are not yet
ſafe from mine; and if they ſtay here but one day more for to marry toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I am certaine to make a funerall-wedding of it. But, anſwered the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that accompanied him, are you very ſure they are ſtill living? I ſaw this
evening, replied <hi>Piſiſtratus, Arcas</hi> the free-man of <hi>Melintus</hi> leading <hi>Dicearchus</hi>
bound, and bringing him into a houſe. I ſent one of my ſervants to follow
them, and commanded him to enquire what they did in that lodging, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7768:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as if he had ſome buſineſſe there. He brought me word, that hee ſaw
<hi>Trebatius, Melintus, Palamede, Ariana</hi> and <hi>Dicearchus</hi> at good accord together,
and that there was nothing but rejoycing amongſt them, and I make no doubt
of what he told me, becauſe he knowes them all as well as I doe. But, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
he whom he ſpake to, when you have ſpoken to the Governour of
<hi>Epire,</hi> to put to death <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede,</hi> becauſe they are the Emperours
enemies, and told him how <hi>Trebatius</hi> had beene ſent from <hi>Nero</hi> for the
ſame purpoſe, doe you thinke he will beleeve you? <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> anſwered,
you doe not know then, how they have beene proclaimed throughout all
the Provinces, enemies of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and of the decree that is gone out to kill
them in what place ſoever they be found. No, no, <hi>Maxentius</hi> cannot deferre
their putting to death, becauſe he is advertis'd of the Imperiall order, and
if he makes any difficulty of doing it, I will threaten to accuſe him too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Nero. Palamede</hi> knowing in what ſort <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> would be revenged, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to prevent him by killing him firſt: preſently he drew his ſword, and
ſtaying him by the reines of his horſe, for feare he ſhould eſcape, ſtrucke him
a great blow into the body; <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> cryed out that they murder'd him;
he that was with him tooke his flight, and <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> had never eſcap'd that
danger, had it not beene for a miſchance that befell <hi>Palamede;</hi> for his foot
ſlipt when he was going to redouble his blow, and he was conſtrain'd to quit
the bridle of the horſe, which carried away his Maſter ſo farre that he could
never overtake him. <hi>Palamede</hi> was forced to returne the way he came, and
having found his owne horſe againe, he rode backe into the City, when the
daylight began to appeare. Being come to his lodging, he told his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to <hi>Melintus</hi> and the reſt, and counſelled them that without troubling
themſelves more about their wedding, they ſhould depart as ſuddenly as they
could: becauſe <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> having eſcaped out of his hands would not faile
to goe to <hi>Maxentius,</hi> if his wounds hindred him not. This newes brought no
ſmall trouble againe to the contentments they expected. <hi>Ariana</hi> then beſought
<hi>Melintus,</hi> that he would no more deſire to have their marriage perform'd,
till they were in a place full of repoſe and ſecurity; and ſaid, he ſhould firſt
of all thinke upon his owne ſafety, and afterward ſhe would endevour to
make his life as happy to him, as ſhe poſſibly could. <hi>Melintus</hi> was conſtrain'd
to obey her, and <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> approving the wiſdome of <hi>Ariana,</hi> was of her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.
Inſtantly they all conſidered upon the retreat, and they repented
them for having ſent away the veſſell; becauſe they would have ſav'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
more certainly by Sea, although the way were longer: nevertheleſſe
they were reſolv'd to goe by land, and to put their baggage into Carts, and
they were perſwaded, that there being above fifty of their troop counting
the traine they had, nothing leſſe than an Army would aſſault them. So they
encouraged themſelves to depart, that they might get out of <hi>Epire</hi> before
<hi>Maxentius</hi> the Governour were advertis'd by <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> and having bought as
many horſes as they needed, they put into the way, truſting in the gods and
their owne courage. This troop ſo faire, and ſo perſecuted of men, had the
good fortune to paſſe <hi>Epire</hi> in three or foure dayes journeyes, and at laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
in <hi>Theſſaly</hi> without any adventure. They wanted no diverſions, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
having at leaſt with them what they made moſt of; for which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
themſelves ſo happy, as it ſeem'd they deſir'd nothing but the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
<pb facs="tcp:7768:138"/>
of the ſame kinde of life. Yet <hi>Melintus</hi> gave not over his admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that miſery ſhould perſecute them with ſo much eagerneſſe, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them ſo much as one day of repoſe, for to let them enjoy a bleſſing they
deſir'd, and which ever eſcaped them when they thought to have attained it;

               <p>Thus did <hi>Ariana's</hi> preſence give a great eaſe to the love of <hi>Melintus:</hi> but
in all the troop there was not a more afflicted man than <hi>Palamede,</hi> who regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Epicharis,</hi> and met not a paſſenger that he demanded not newes of her.
Beſides, he was in a kinde of conſtraint with <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> not daring before
him to let that affection appeare, and ſo was depriv'd of this conſolation at
leaſt, in the power of free complaining. <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> had no greater pleaſure
than to make <hi>Areas</hi> or ſome other relate the admirable life of her ſonne, and
with how many marvellous qualities heaven had furniſhed him; whereat ſhe
ceaſed not to give the gods thanks, and eſteeme her ſelfe very happy. She had
already paſſionate cares for the faire and vertuous <hi>Ariana,</hi> whoſe reſpectuous
duties ſhe receiv'd with much contentment. <hi>Lepantus</hi> and <hi>Cyllenia</hi> were no
ſmall ornament to this faire company, but recreated them with their ſweet
humour, and gentileneſſe of wit; and all of them together made up a
troop of as pleaſing travellers as could be found in all the world againe.</p>
               <p>Already had they traverſed all <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and were approaching to <hi>Lariſſa</hi>
which is neare the Sea; when they entred a village where they ſaw all the
inhabitants in great trouble. They all ran up and downe divers wayes, not
able to finde ſecurity in their owne houſes, and not knowing to what part
they ſhould retire. <hi>Melintus</hi> addreſs'd him to ſome of theſe forlorne men, and
asked the cauſe of this affrighting and diſorder. They told him how a fearefull
number of <hi>Scythians,</hi> after having croſſed <hi>Thracia,</hi> and paſs'd the Egean Sea,
was come to land in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and plonder'd all thoſe coaſts in drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Lariſſa. Melintus</hi> re-aſſur'd them the beſt he could, and was of opinion
they ſhould all retire them into that Towne as ſpeedily as they could: that
to be better receiv'd, they were to carry with them the moſt of the Corne
and other victuals they had: he promis'd he would ſerve them for a leader,
and prayed them to have no feare. This reſolution being taken among them,
he rallied all thoſe that were ſcatter'd, and having made them load into Carts
all the proviſions they had, he armed the ſtrongeſt of them, who made
three hundred men, beſides thoſe were with him: then he appointed to ſet
a good watch all the night, and the next day in the morning he diſpoſed the
old people with the women and baggage in the middle, and put thoſe that
might ſerve to fight, part of them in the head, part on the flanks, and the
reſt in the rere. He gave the vantgard to be led by <hi>Lepantus,</hi> the rere-ward to
<hi>Palamede,</hi> and reſerv'd to himſelfe the groſſe, for to have an eye over all. Hee
<pb facs="tcp:7768:139"/>
would have given the command to <hi>Dicearchus;</hi> but the old man finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
then indiſpoſed, becauſe he felt a thouſand vexations, and as many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
within him, and not able to employ his minde in giving orders, hee
intreated <hi>Melintus</hi> to take the charge upon him. In the meane time <hi>Palamede</hi>
and <hi>Lepantus</hi> had armed them with <hi>Melintus,</hi> in the faireſt armes they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
their baggage, and prepar'd themſelves well to defend the perſons
they led, againſt all powers that might aſſaile them, and they parted thus in
good order, marching towards <hi>Lariſſa.</hi> They were no ſooner two miles from
the village, but they perceiv'd a body of <hi>Scythians</hi> of about two thouſand men
comming towards them. <hi>Melintus</hi> encourag'd his ſouldiers to fight valiantly,
and fearing the cowardiſe which is ordinary with peaſants, enflamed them
by the conſideration they had to defend not onely their perſons, but their
parents, their wives, their children and their goods: that if they ran away,
they abandon'd them all to the mercy of the enemies; but if they ſhewed
themſelves to have heart, they would finde nothing ſo cowardly as theſe
Barbarians, who know well to purſue cruelly thoſe that flye them, but yet
faile not alſo to flye from thoſe that dare attend them. After thus animating
them, he gave order to <hi>Lepantus</hi> to goe charge the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who thinking
they had beene a farre greater number by reaſon of the baggage that tooke up
much place, defended themſelves onely as being to fight with an equall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of their enemies: nevertheleſſe they fail'd not, courageouſly to receive
<hi>Lepantus,</hi> and ſhot their arrowes thicke upon his troop. <hi>Melintus</hi> a while after
advanc'd, and his men ſeeing ſo hardy a Captaine, were not wanting to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him. He had commanded his ſouldiers to joyne cloſe to the enemies as
ſoone as they could, hoping that the <hi>Scythians</hi> having no more the ſpace that
is requiſite for ſhooting their arrowes, would be forced to come to fight with
the ſword, wherein they were no way expert. This ſubtilty ſucceeded to
his wiſh: for the <hi>Scythians</hi> being neare-hand charged by <hi>Melintus,</hi> and not
able any longer to uſe their bowes, could not ſuſtaine the great ſword-blowes
he aſſailed them with: where-ever <hi>Melintus</hi> ſhewed himſelfe, the Barbarians
vaniſhed: and yet flying none but him, they made ſome diſorder in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part, and ſo held the victory in ſuſpence. But <hi>Palamede</hi> who perceived
a ſide of their troop to ſuffer the worſt of it, went preſently away, and ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely
relieved them, that the <hi>Scythians</hi> could reſiſt no longer. Then
they threw away their Armes, and tooke flight on all parts. <hi>Lepantus</hi> on his
ſide practis'd all the valour and good government could be ſhewne; and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
apppear'd like lightning, to what place ſoever he ſpurr'd his horſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo provok'd by the faire <hi>Ariana's</hi> preſence, as he cut off as many arms and
heads as his ſword could reach. In the end after having left above twelve
thouſand men upon the place, they would not purſue the reſt, for feare of
abandoning the deare treaſures that were with their baggage, but returning
full of bloud, of ſweat and honourable duſt, they accompanied their troop
which were in great feare for them during the fight, and marched on by
little and little to <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> where they were received with much honour
and joy.</p>
               <p>The fray was great within the Towne, for it was deſtitute of a chiefe that
underſtood the warre: ſo as having learn'd the defeat of this number of <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
by the valour of <hi>Melintus,</hi> they all with one accord ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7768:140"/>
to him, and prayed him not to forſake them in this danger, untill the
<hi>Romans</hi> ſent them a commander with ſuccours. <hi>Melintus</hi> ſeeing himſelfe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to remaine there, was conſtrain'd to accept the charge, although he were
in feare to come to the knowledge of the <hi>Romans:</hi> nevertheleſſe hee hoped
to make himſelfe neceſſary in this occaſion, and that the warre would change
many things, and to the end he might not ſo ſoone be diſcover'd by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
he acquir'd, he reſolv'd to change his name with <hi>Palamede,</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the advice <hi>Trebatius</hi> had given them, and called himſelfe <hi>Alcydamas,</hi> and
<hi>Palamede, Polydore.</hi> They were lodged in one of the faireſt houſes of the
Towne, where <hi>Dicearchus</hi> preſently betooke him to his bed, feeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſicke, and ſcarcely able to endure day-light for the griefes that aſſailed
him: <hi>Euphroſyne, Ariana,</hi> and <hi>Cyllenia</hi> refreſhed themſelves after their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels;
and their feares were ſomething appeaſed. The chiefe of the Towne
came to receive order from <hi>Alcydamas,</hi> who having knowne that the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
could make to the number of five thouſand men of warre, beleeved he
might with them very well defend himſelfe: then taking <hi>Lepantus</hi> and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi>
he went with them and the principall Townes-men to viſit round about
the City, and ſee in what manner it was defenſible with walls and ditches,
and what places were weakeſt. After he had beene aſſur'd on all ſides, hee
ſet men at the ports, and other places which he judg'd important; and for
the ſouldiers that were not of any guard, hee appointed them a continuall
exerciſe of armes, of purpoſe to make them warriers, and that they might
ſerve when he ſhould have need of them; and at the ſame time he diſpatch'd
one of his men to goe finde <hi>Eurymedon</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> and advertiſe
him how they had need of his ſuccours.</p>
               <p>When eight dayes were ſpent, onely in cauſing a ſure guard to be made,
and in inſtructing his men, he thought it now timely to make a ſally out: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
willing ſo much time ſhould ſlip away without ſhewing himſelfe to the
<hi>Scythians,</hi> to make them ſlacke of their firſt fury, and beleeve it was out of a
great feare they had of them, that they thus blocked up themſelves. That
made them more negligent, and ſo ſpread them into divers troops, for to
goe a forraging about, ſtaying untill they reſolved to give an aſſault. <hi>Alcyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
tooke his time, and leaving <hi>Lepantus</hi> to command within the City, iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
out with <hi>Polydore</hi> in the head of fifteene hundred men, and went to
charge the <hi>Scythians</hi> that were divided and in diſorder, whereof he left more
than foure thouſand on the place: then ſeeing a body of above ten thouſand
men comming to charge them, he made his retreat, having loſt not above
thirty men in this combat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcydamas</hi> was receiv'd into the Towne with cryes of joy from all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who look'd upon him as their god protector: but nothing was ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to him as the careſſes of his faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> who at the returne of his ſallies
whence he came often backe with glory, receiv'd him victorious, and tooke
the paines to diſarme him, finding her ſelfe in an exceſſe of joy to ſee him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and be delivered from the feares ſhe had, when he was gone abroad.
<hi>Alcydamas</hi> was then in an unparalell'd rapture, though hee were aſhamed for
the paine theſe faire hands tooke, which were too delicate to handle iron:
he kiſſed them ever as ſhe brought them either to undoe his Corſlet, or his
Gantlets; and when he was wholly diſarmed, he fainted for pleaſure in giving
<pb facs="tcp:7768:140"/>
her more ſtreight and freer embracements. Theſe kindneſſes were ſhewne in
preſence of the ſage <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> who was tranſported her ſelfe with joy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the perfect union of theſe excellent ſoules, to whom ſhe wiſhed a
ſpeedy repoſe in ſome place of aſſurance. Theſe were the contentments <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydamas</hi>
gave his friends by his frequent victories, thus making the joy of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him Conqueror, often ſucceed the feare they had to ſee him in danger. But
at length he was to yeeld up the authority he had in the City to one <hi>Arimin,</hi>
who was ſent by <hi>Flavian</hi> the governour of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Theſſaly:</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
<hi>Arimin</hi> having underſtood the great exploits <hi>Alcydamas</hi> had done, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
him to continue together with him the cares he had taken over the
Towne, and ſtill to employ his valour in the defence of it. <hi>Alcydamas</hi> and
<hi>Polydore</hi> made yet ſome more ſallies, which brought them into ſuch eſteeme
with <hi>Arimin,</hi> that nothing was done but by their advice. They maintain'd
themſelves thus a long time, the <hi>Scythians</hi> never daring to approach the walls
for the ſcaling of a Towne whence ſuch valiant men iſſued. But in the end
their great number having affrighted all <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and the neighbour Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Flavian</hi> and the Pretor that govern'd <hi>Epire,</hi> were oblig'd to joyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what troops they had to goe fight with them. They had in all ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
men, and <hi>Alcydamas</hi> and <hi>Polydore</hi> having received advice that they would
give the battell, demanded leave of <hi>Arimin</hi> to goe thither, and went out in
the head of two thouſand Gentlemen of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and three thouſand foot
that <hi>Arimin</hi> ſent. Their arrivall was extremely acceptable to <hi>Maxentius</hi> and
<hi>Flavian,</hi> who ſeeing them of ſo good a mine, and having beene advertis'd
of their valorous actions, receiv'd them into the counſell of warre, wherein
was propounded, in what place they were to fight with the enemy. They
were all agreed that becauſe of the inequality of the number, it behov'd them
to ſeek out ſome advantageous place, which made <hi>Maxentius</hi> &amp; <hi>Flavian</hi> of the
opinion that they ſhould labor to draw them into the covert places of <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
between the mount <hi>Olympus</hi> and the river <hi>Peneus,</hi> to the end they might not
extend their troops in ſo ſtreight a place, nor they themſelves be encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by them. This counſell was ready to be followed: but <hi>Alcydamas</hi> ſaid,
they were to take great heed of drawing the Barbarians into the middeſt of
their Countrey; becauſe there being no retreats there, they would without
doubt obſtinately intend the victory, and the greater number might thus car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it away from the leſſer. That his advice was, they ſhould goe and fight
with them as neare their ſhipping as they could, that amongſt the rocks the
ſame advantages of ſtreight places were to be found; and that the Barbarians
having their retreats ſo neare, would not faile to goe ſeeke them in the leaſt
fray they had: that ſince they had no other deſigne but to chace them away,
they were to facilitate their flight, and not to reduce them to a place where
they ſhould be obliged to kill to the very laſt man for to vanquiſh them. For
his part he thought it more fitting to goe fight with them in the very place
where they had ſeated their Camp, which was betweene the City of <hi>Lariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi>
and the Sea coaſt; for in caſe the <hi>Romans</hi> had not the better, they ſhould
have the Towne for retreat, and this place was ſtreightned by reaſon of the
rocks, and as commodious as they could deſire it. Theſe conſiderations were
found moſt prudent, and every one having followed this advice, they reſolv'd
to fight with them the next day, and to goe lodge about the Towne for to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:7768:141"/>
be neare againſt the morning. In the meane time they ordained their battell
thus: It was decreed that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould in the point be commanded by
<hi>Maxentius,</hi> the <hi>Macedonians</hi> ſhould march on the right ſide with <hi>Flavian</hi>
in one battalion, and that the <hi>Epirotes</hi> and <hi>Theſſalians</hi> ſhould be on the left
ſide led by a Knight of <hi>Rome</hi> call'd <hi>Milo:</hi> the Cavallery of the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> was
order'd to be upon the two wings, whereof there ſhould be a thouſand men
on the right wing commanded by <hi>Alcydamas,</hi> and as many on the left, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Polydore</hi> for chiefe. All things having beene diſpos'd in this order, and
every one encourag'd to doe well, they retired them to the places about <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa:</hi>
but the Cavallery was lodged in the Towne with a command that at
the point of day they ſhould joyne with the body of the Army. <hi>Alcydamas</hi> and
<hi>Polydore</hi> brought backe their troops thither, the firſt of them retired to his
lodging, and the other having had charge to guard the ports on the <hi>Scythians</hi>
ſide, went to repoſe himſelfe in the <hi>Corps de gard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcydamas</hi> at this returne found <hi>Dicearchus</hi> very ſicke, who knowing hee
was arrived, ſent to intreat him to come to him; he told him that he rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſee him before his death, and having made <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> and <hi>Ariana</hi> be
ſent for too, he prayed them willingly to hearken to him, and ſpake thus:</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Hiſtory of Dicearchus and Acidalia.</head>
                  <p>SInce my ſickneſſe reduces me to extremity, I will not depart the world
with the reputation of a man ſo wicked and cruell as you have reaſon to
eſteeme me; and to keepe my memory from being ſo odious with you, I am
conſtrain'd to recite my whole life to you, (which I may call a continuall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter,)
without concealing any thing, either of thoſe ſhamefull accidents that
happened to me, or the violent and furious reſolutions which the cruelty of
my fortune forced me to take.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe, ambition has beene the outrageous paſſion that alwayes diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
me, to which that other of love mixing it ſelfe too, theſe two furies
together have ſo cruelly tormented me, that I have not beene Maſter of my
owne actions, but let my ſelfe be govern'd by them without ever calling rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to my ayd. <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> knowes in what ſort my youth hath paſſed: for
I doubt not but ſhe knowes how from my younger age it was impoſſible for
me to endure an equall in <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> beleeving that my Nobility and courage
gave me advantages, which none beſides my ſelfe could pretend to Living
thus, I had many quarrels to redreſſe with the chiefe of the young men of the
City, over whom I was ever to have the better, or elſe I had no reſt. When
I was about the age of twenty yeares, ſeeing <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> to be the beſt of thoſe
that were in conſideration at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> I conceiv'd that there ought to be fixed
the end of my deſires. At the beginning I was not drawne to the ſearch of
her, but through the feare I had that if another came to poſſeſſe her, it would
be a teſtimony that he were more eſteem'd than I: but afterwards finding in
her excellent qualities, I joyned in ſuch ſort love to my ambition, that there
was not a meane I would not then have enterpriſed to attaine to her good
graces. She knowes the ſervices I endevour'd to render her, and how many
artifices I made uſe of for advancing my deſigne: one while employing mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence,
to ſhew the grandeur of my eſtate and birth, another while uſing
<pb facs="tcp:7768:141"/>
an extreme modeſty for to gaine her mothers heart, who approv'd not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
expences: In the end I turned me a thouſand wayes to vanquiſh
her, finding that I was ingag'd both by honour and love to carry her from all
the reſt: nevertheleſſe I acquired nothing upon the ſpirit of <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> or
her mother. But when <hi>Hermocrates</hi> was return'd from his voyages wherein
he had followed <hi>Germanicus,</hi> I found my ſelfe more reculed yet by farre from
what I pretended: becauſe <hi>Hermocrates</hi> having prevented the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> by
a great reputation they had of him, even before he was return'd, every one
fixt his eyes upon him as ſoone as ever he appeared; and it ſeem'd they would
not ſo much as take the paines to regard me. That contempt ſo animated my
jealous ambition, that I feared not to declare my ſelfe his enemy; having as
then no other cauſe of hating him but that he was more honour'd than my
ſelfe; and the more lovely he rendred him to all men, the more did I ſee him
with diſpleaſure. But when he attempted to love <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> my jealouſie
went upon a viſible foundation, and I practis'd what I was able both openly
and ſecretly, for to deſtroy the opinion was had of him. Yet for all this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
nothing that way, and perceiving how by my expulſion he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
at <hi>Euphroſyne's,</hi> I cannot expreſſe to you what rage I felt within my
heart; at laſt I found the invention to drive him from that houſe, by meanes
of a letter counterfetted from <hi>Eryx,</hi> father of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> to the mother of
<hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> wherein he intreated her not to ſuffer his ſonne at her houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had deſtin'd him ſome where elſe. This crafty device ſucceeded for
a time, every one being ready to reſent that which touches upon their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and you know that an offence of this kind ſo ſurpriſes, that its impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
one ſhould then thinke of doubting whether the thing be true or falſe.
<hi>Euphroſyne's</hi> mother preſently baniſh'd <hi>Hermocrates</hi> her houſe, without hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
any defence he could make. And for me, knowing what had happened
to him, I inforc'd my ſelfe to the uttermoſt of my power for to gaine <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroſyne</hi>
in that reſentment of injury, hoping that to worke <hi>Eryx</hi> deſpight,
they would turne their eyes upon me. But <hi>Eryx</hi> and <hi>Hermocrates</hi> having made
all cleare together, my plot wrought its effect againſt my ſelfe, and in a ſmall
time the marriage of <hi>Hermocrates</hi> and <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> was agreed on, and ſoone
after accompliſh'd. I conceiv'd ſuch a deſpite at the contempt they made of
me, and at the good fortune of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> that a hundred times I reſolv'd
to have him dye: but ſeeing there was no remedy to undoe what was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
done, I could no longer endure to live at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> where I ſhould be
conſtrain'd to ſee perpetually an object that was ſo troubleſome to my ſight,
but went my way for a long time to <hi>Corinth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I was there arriv'd, all my acquaintance labour'd to divert me, and
I ſought nothing elſe my ſelfe, but to expell the griefe that tormented me:
I went often into companies, and at laſt willing to chace away the paſſions I
travell'd with, by one that might be more happy for me, I had a deſigne to
make another love, and caſting my eyes upon <hi>Acidalia</hi> that was the faireſt of
all <hi>Corinth,</hi> I enterpriz'd to love her. I was willing at my firſt comming to
dazle the eyes of thoſe of <hi>Corinth,</hi> by aproud bravery of clothes and traine,
which made me be honour'd throughout all companies. All the Maids that
love theſe externall ornaments, regarded me with a deſire, and attended with
much unquietneſſe the choyce I would make of ſome one of them: ſo as
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:7768:142"/>
when I made my addreſſes to <hi>Acidalia,</hi> ſhe received me with a great deale of
contentment, and I perceiv'd as ſoone the plots of ſome other women, that
labour'd to put me off from this affection, by a thouſand malicious inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
againſt <hi>Acidalia:</hi> but thoſe attempts wrought no effect upon me: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiwiſe,
the intelligence I had of their purpoſe, cauſed me to be farther
ingag'd with her; and becauſe ſhe was very handſome, by little and little I
was taken with a very violent paſſion. She uſed much coldneſſe at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
to aſſure her ſelfe the more of me, and confeſs'd not that ſhe would
love me but after a long time: But when ſhe ſaw me intirely ſubmitted, ſhe
tooke a kinde of Empire over me; notwithſtanding ſhe oblig'd me with a
great confidence, and ſo mingling her favours to ſome affected rigours, ſhe
made me ſo in love, as I could not live any where but beſides her. At that
time a young man call'd <hi>Attalus</hi> frequented with us, who was well enough
borne, but that made himſelfe ſo acceptable by many pleaſant actions, and
jeſting humours, that they thought there could be no good mirth if he were
not in the company. 'Tis true, he was of ſo merry a diſpoſition, and ſo borne
to buffonnery, as the features of his face, his armes, his legs, and all the reſt
of his body were not deficient in executing what everſlights his wit ordained
them. There was not a ridiculous perſon that he imitated not, no ſubtilty he
was ignorant of: but he had ſo ſtudied to counterfet the diſcourſe of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
and ſtupid people, as it would have beene a difficult matter for him to
ſpeake ſeriouſly. I perceiv'd that <hi>Acidalia</hi> tooke a little more pleaſure than
was fitting in whatſoever <hi>Attalus</hi> did. As ſoone as ever he ſpake, ſhe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the quickneſſe of his wit: if he turned but a foot or a hand, ſhe made an
obſervation of the gentileneſſe of his poſtures, and alwayes gave advice to
the very firſt of his motions, for feare hee might loſe the praiſe of any one
action. I was angry for that ſhe was ſomething overmuch carried away in
the eſtimation of him, judging it proceeded from a weake ſpirit, to thinke
that highly commendable, which was ſimply ridiculous. I endevoured to
make her loſe by little and little this good opinion ſhe had of <hi>Attalus,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her to underſtand that he had reaſon thus to counterfet ſots and fooles,
becauſe he could never make a diſcourſe himſelfe that expreſſed an ability to
any thing: that ſuch wits as theſe were not proper but for laughter, and that
we were to have a care of truſting them with a ſecret, or expecting any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
from them in a matter of importance: beſides, we ſee ordinarily that
women and maids love theſe perſons in publike to make them laugh, but for
thinking them worthy their affection, they are well aware of; becauſe this
ſort of men cannot have the conditions that are neceſſary long time to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a friendſhip: for, ſaid I to her, reſpect, diſcretion, and fidelity, are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
too ſerious for ſuch ready wits: they are ſo free and flitting, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure a conſtraint; and rather than loſe a good word or a pleaſant acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they will quit all conſiderations of keeping an affection ſecret. <hi>Acidalia</hi>
knew well I ſpake as one intereſſed, and that made her doubt the goodneſſe
of my reaſons: and yet ſhe beleev'd me for a while. But at laſt <hi>Attalus</hi> having
perceiv'd her inclination, which ſhe could nolonger conceale, began to be
more ſparing of his buffonnery in all companies, and expreſs'd to her that he
made uſe of thoſe actions but onely to pleaſe her. This oblig'd her entirely,
and <hi>Attalus</hi> knowing what progreſſe he made in her good graces, ſet himſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:7768:142"/>
forward to take other liberties of her without any great hazard: for if ſhee
would not ſuffer him, it was excus'd by the free humour of <hi>Attalus;</hi> and if
ſhe would ſuffer him, he knew well how to uſe the ſame favour often. All
this I ſaw with a great deale of deſpight, but could not remedy it, and ſtill
I loved her infinitely; and my love increaſing, augmented my rage, to ſee
him receive favours I durſt not pretend to. <hi>Acidalia</hi> let her ſelfe be ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with this fooliſh love of <hi>Attalus,</hi> that ſhe could now conceale it no
longer: if he were in any place, ſhe muſt inſtantly leave what company ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to goe to him; and ſhe was ſo blinded in admiring all he did, as ſhee
perceiv'd not the viſible appearance ſhe made to every one of her paſſion. I
repreſented to her as diſcreetly as I could what injury ſhe did her ſelfe, and
let her ſee that ſhe ought to eſteeme of me otherwiſe than o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> him: but ſhee
could not endure to heare me ſpeake any more after that faſhion; and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
ſhe began to ſhun me for feare I ſhould importune her with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and had no care now but for her <hi>Attalus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt needs relate to you in the end the cruelleſt of my griefes, and the
ſubject of all my ſhame. One day I went to her houſe ſomething late in the
afternoone, and knowing ſhe was gone out to walke, I reſolv'd to attend
her in her chamber, and layd me downe upon a bed, where inſenſibly I fell
aſleepe. But yet I awaked when ſhe came in, and ſaw <hi>Attalus</hi> alone with
her in the Chamber: ſhe knew not I was in the houſe; ſo as I remov'd as
farre as I could toward the farther ſide of the bed into the darke, for feare of
being perceiv'd, but ſo as I could ſee what they did. She tooke off the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercher
that cover'd her necke, and preſently <hi>Attalus</hi> ſet himſelfe to kiſſe it
freely enough, becauſe ſhe tooke pleaſure in thoſe careſſes, and in the concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
flatreries wherewith he admir'd the beauty of that necke, and confeſſed
himſelfe beholding for the liberty ſhe gave him: then he added in mockery;
But truly, Madam, you ought to grant the like favours to <hi>Dicearchus</hi> that loves
you ſo ſeriouſly; and ſhe anſwered him, If I ſhould permit him the ſame, he
would never take them with ſo good a grace as you doe. I was ſtrucke to the
quicke at thoſe words, but yet I endur'd farre more ſenſible blowes after.
They ſate them downe upon ſeats that were at the bed, feet, where indeed I
could not ſee them, but I might eaſily heare what they ſaid. After ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
expreſſing that ſhe permitted him great privacies, I heard her ſay, Ha
gods! <hi>Attalus,</hi> let me alone; are you not yet ſatisfied? and a while after ſhe
added: Well, are you now content? I beleeve for the preſent that ſhe onely
permitted him ſome liberties, which yet are not to be ſuffered: but then my
jealouſie forced me to beleeve that thoſe words ſignified he had obtain'd the
very laſt favours of her, and never caſting ſo much as a doubt of it, I entred
into ſo great a fury, as I repented me a hundred times that I had not a poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
about me for to kill them both: but being unable to revenge my ſelfe at
that time, my ſhame and my deſpight conſtrain'd me to hold my peace, for
feare they knew I had beene a witneſſe of their kindneſſes. They went away
ſoone enough for being ſurpriz'd, and for me, having ſtayed ſome time full
of confuſion and rage, I retir'd me as ſecretly as I could, with more feare
of being diſcovered, than if I had done an action my ſelfe that were very
ſhamefull.</p>
                  <p>When I was at home, I ſhut my ſelfe up alone, and there my love provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:7768:143"/>
by ſo cruell an offence, abandon'd me to fury and deſpaire: I tore my
haire, I outrageouſly ſtrucke my ſelfe, and acted all that a violent rage forces
one to doe. I ſaw well enough that I might deſpiſe this <hi>Acidalia,</hi> and leave
her at liberty with her <hi>Attalus:</hi> but I was ſo powerfully engaged to love her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as I beleev'd I had receiv'd as great an injury from her, as if already ſhee had
beene my wife. I conſidered her in her fault, and then deſpiſed her: but
preſently I imagin'd her as handſome as might be, and then I could not ſo
much as endure the thought that another ſhould poſſeſſe her. But what? ſaid
I, ſhall I love her ſtill, and not rather have in diſdaine a perſon defiled? the
ſhame of her ſex, and the reliques of <hi>Attalus?</hi> Shall I ſtill continue to deſire
what I ought to have in horror, and eſteeme my ſelfe miſerable for having
beene a witneſſe of that ſhe endured, in ſtead of rejoycing for having knowne
her levity and weakneſſe? No, no, let us be more wiſe, and expell out of our
minde this beauty that hides ſo many defects, and hath not offended my love
but in deſtroying it ſelfe. I remain'd ſome time in this reſolution; and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
after this <hi>Acidalia</hi> return'd into my mind with more charmes than ever;
and it ſeem'd my imagination was pleas'd in repreſenting her to mee, the
more gloriouſly to keepe me from forgetting her, and embroyle me in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
trouble. Then I replied thus: What then, ſhall I leave her in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of another, and while I am in paine to be deliver'd from ſo ſweet and
cruell a remembrance, ſhall <hi>Attalus</hi> peaceably enjoy <hi>Acidalia,</hi> and taſte as
many delights, as I torments? Whither ſhall I flye? Wretched man, ſhall I
ſtay at <hi>Corinth,</hi> to ſee continually my owne miſery, and be the more ſenſible
of it? or rather returne to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> to ſee on the other ſide <hi>Hermocrates</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
with <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> whoſe contentments will every houre renue in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
thoſe of <hi>Attalus</hi> with <hi>Acidalia? Acidalia,</hi> thou cruell, ingrate, fooliſh,
unchaſte woman, can I ſtill love thee? But againe, <hi>Acidalia,</hi> full of beauty,
of graces, and of charmes, can I not love thee? Spirit unworthy to be loved
of me: but beauty worthy of all the vowes of the earth. O deſpight, O love,
what am I to doe? Shall I love her, or ſhall I not love her?</p>
                  <p>My ſoule was thus agitated with a thouſand furious and extravagant
thoughts, and my rage ſo tranſported me, as I conceived a reſolution where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
you will bleſſe your ſelfe, not finding the like to have beene taken by any
man in all the ages of the world. No, ſaid I, 'tis certaine that I ought not to
love her; but contrariwiſe that I am to purſue with a mortall hate, her that
hath done me ſo cruell an outrage: but I ought to provide too, that none
elſe poſſeſſe her. I will marry her, to the end I may have the power to make
her as miſerable, as ſhe makes my life diſaſtrous. I will never touch her my
ſelfe, not enduring any more to come neare a perſon that is defiled: but I
ſhall take order that none elſe approach her neither, and by this meanes I
ſhall have but the diſpleaſures for not enjoying her, which every way are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydable.</p>
                  <p>After having paſſed away the night in tormenting my minde with theſe
furious imaginations, I fortified me ſo well in this ſtrange reſolution, that
the next day morning I went to one of her uncles to intreat him to ſpeak with
her mother concerning our marriage, knowing well they would receive me
preſently; and to oblige him to diſpatch this buſineſſe, I made him a preſent
of a Diamond of great value. I had ſetled my face as well as I was able, to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:7768:143"/>
feine a great affection: and ſome time after I had an anſwer as favourable as
I deſired. <hi>Acidalia</hi> her ſelfe was not repugnant to her friends will, well
knowing they would never have conſented that ſhe married <hi>Attalus.</hi> Shee
expreſs'd a reception of me with much contentment, for to abuſe me; and
I feined alſo to deſire with impatiency the day of our marriage, making ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
all the joy I could; although the more I ſaw her then, the more I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
with my ſelfe to hate her. <hi>Attalus</hi> was ſome dayes at her houſe about
that time, and I well obſerv'd the lookes they ſent one another, the one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
my happineſſe, and the other making ſhew that ſhe receiv'd me againſt
her will; and they knew not that I was ſo well acquainted with their intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:
but I had ſtrange deſignes within me.</p>
                  <p>In the end our marriage-day arrives, and all the ceremonies being perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
at night they brought us to lye together; but that night was a ſtrange
one: for as ſoone as we were left alone together, I ſaid to her; <hi>Acidalia,</hi>
thinke you I am at this preſent the <hi>Dicearchus</hi> heretofore ſo amorous of your
beauty, and ſo ready to obey your commands? No, no, know that I am your
cruelleſt enemy, and have not married you but to make you the miſerableſt
creature in the world. She began to cry, and asked me why I ſpake on that
faſhion to her. Goe, ſaid I, filthy ſhameleſſe woman, lament your fault one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and never hope to have me moved. Remember your ſelfe what <hi>Attalus</hi>
obtain'd of you, whereof I was witneſſe, and beleeve I have not married you
to enjoy his leavings, but to hinder his enjoying of you, and make you eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day feele the puniſhment of the injury you have offered me. She denied
a long time that ſhe had ever permitted <hi>Attalus</hi> any thing: but at laſt ſeeing
how I knew too much of that they had ſaid one to another, ſhe was brought
to confeſſe to me that ſhe had onely granted him ſome few liberties, for
which ſhe demanded pardon of me with a torrent of teares: nevertheleſſe
I would not beleeve her, and ſhe could never make me relent; ſo as all the
night paſſed in reproaches, in deſpaires, in ſighings and in teares. The next
day thoſe that came to viſit us, were in a great wonder to ſee her in the eſtate
of one in deſperation, and they knew not what to thinke of it. I ſaw well ſhe
had a deſire to ſeeke to her mother for refuge, and by making her complaints
to her, to obtaine that I might not carry her away to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and that ſhee
would take her home to her houſe; but I prevented that, for the very
ſame day I had made a Veſſell be prepar'd with all my furniture, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken leave of my friends in <hi>Corinth,</hi> I conſtrain'd her to depart
with me.</p>
                  <p>Judge a little what hope I could have of ever enjoying any contentment:
I tooke for my ordinary companion a perſon that was the plague of my life,
and to whom I was reſolv'd to be a perpetuall ſcourge, having attempted ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to let her enjoy any repoſe, ſince ſhe rendred me the moſt miſerable of
men. But when we were come to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> I was much troubled, finding
my ſelfe oblig'd to watch continually over her I could not regard but with
ſorrow, and whom I fear'd alſo to provoke overmvch, for feare ſhe might
not be moved once againe to take my honour from me, and it may be my
life. Yet ſhe neither was of a violent nature, nor able to conceive a daring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution:
onely when I was alone, ſhe came ſometimes to me, and caſting her
ſelfe at my feet, ſhe implor'd my pitty, and deſir'd pardon of me in ſhedding
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:7768:144"/>
abundance of teares, embracing my knees, and making a thouſand ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Her weeping, and her beauty did a little ſhake me; but preſently I tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
away my ſight, and full of cruell reſolution, ſaid to her; Madam, if you
could recover the purity you have loſt, you might have cauſe to expect my
friendſhip; but ſince that is impoſſible, beleeve I have alwayes your fault pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to my remembrance, which forbids you to hope for any pardon at my
hands. She made me then a thouſand oaths, that the fault ſhe had committed
was not ſuch as I beleev'd it; but the gods themſelves had not beene able to
have made me loſe that opinion. Ha, ſaid ſhe then, ſince you will beleeve it,
take me out of the world; let me dye by your hand, and finiſh ſo cruell a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie.
I muſt of neceſſity then, anſwered I, kill my ſelfe at the ſame time, for
I am aſſur'd never to be cured of the reſentment of your offence but by death,
and I cannot comfort my ſelfe but by the revenge I am to take of you. Then
ſhe tooke her ſelfe to injurious ſpeeches againſt me, calling me cruell Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
Tiger, with a thouſand reproaches which her griefe forced her to make
me. But, neither her ſubmiſſions, nor her teares, nor her rage, could ever
bend me. All the relaxation I gave her, was when I let her ſome time live
apart without ſeeing her; being aſſur'd of her continency, becauſe out of
diſpleaſure ſhe had baniſhed her ſelfe from all kinde of companies. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
thus giving torment to another, I was not exempt from it my ſelfe,
and I beleeve I had my minde at leaſtwiſe as much troubled as ſhe, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
to locke up my griefes within my ſoule for feare of expreſſing them
to others, when ſhe gave eaſe to hers by the teares ſhe feared not to ſhed.</p>
                  <p>When I ſaw that I was reduced to ſo miſerable a life by my owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement,
and not encountring in my houſe other than pittifull and funeſt
objects, I reſolv'd with my ſelfe for eaſing of my minde a little by buſineſſes
abroad, to employ me in the publike affaires; and feeling my ſelfe conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with vexations, I tooke an hatred againſt all the world, and wiſh'd to
have ſeene all men as miſerable as I. <hi>Hermocrates</hi> was the firſt object of my
fury: the ancient enmity I had conceiv'd againſt him, cauſed me to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
diſpos'd to wiſh his deſtruction, hoping that if I ſatisfied my paſſion
thus to revenge me on all ſides, I ſhould not at leaſt be depriv'd of all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
I practiſed all ſorts of meanes to ruine him, and having made a league
againſt him, I poſſeſſed my minde with all the deſignes I could thinke of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ſubject, to the end it might be entirely buſied with thoſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and I the leſſe thoughtfull of my domeſticke miſeries. This league
made me powerfull, and I found my ſelfe in eſtate to reſiſt whatſoever hee
propos'd in the publike aſſemblies, and to overthrow all his deſignes: but
finding againe that he ſometimes over-ruled it by the authority he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and the love was ſhewne him, I let my ſelfe be carried away more
than ever with a deſire to ruine him intirely. To this purpoſe I made uſe of
craft to make the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> beleeve he affected tyranny: and by the Armes
I made be found at his houſe, gave a colour to my accuſation, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
had eaſily beene diſcovered falſe, but for the artifices I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to make the <hi>Roman</hi> Pretor judge of this cauſe; but the <hi>Syracuſians</hi>
that loved him prevented me, and yet not daring to abſolve him altogether,
they baniſh'd him onely for five yeares according to their ancient law.</p>
                  <p>I was not content with this judgement, but contrariwiſe I eſteem'd it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
<pb facs="tcp:7768:144"/>
for <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> whom the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> had expreſt ſo much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to, I feared leſt they recalled him not very ſoone from his exile, to
place him in greater authority than ever. By fortune, a little before, certaine
Pyrats had beene taken upon the coaſts, and <hi>Hermocrates</hi> purſuing their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
I attemted to ſave them, onely in contradiction to him. I was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
ſecretly by ſome Sea courſes of their company, that labour'd to corrupt
the Judges; and who having had intelligence of the deſigne I had to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them, offered me all I could deſire of them for the ſafety of thoſe were
taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I refuſed all their preſents; but at the ſame time <hi>Hermocrates</hi> being
condemned to baniſhment, and knowing how he was reſolved to goe to
<hi>Carthage,</hi> I ſent for them, and bound them by oath faithfully to execute
what I deſir'd of them, and I would returne into their hands their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
They promiſed to ſerve me againſt all the world, and preſently I made
be delivered by my ſole authority thoſe that had beene taken, becauſe I go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
all at that time; and having them all at my houſe together, I intreated
them to joyne their quarrels to mine, and ſo to order the matter as they might
take <hi>Hermocrates</hi> their enemy and mine, as he went to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and carry
him away with his wife ſo farre off, that no more ſhould be heard of him
within <hi>Sicily;</hi> that for this cauſe they were to ſell them to ſome Barbarians,
and I deſired too of them it might be done ſeparately, to the end I might
thus diſ-unite thoſe whoſe union had given me ſo much jealouſie and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>They all receiv'd this intreaty with much joy, as well for having occaſion
to expreſſe in what ſort they deſired to ſerve me, as to be reueng'd upon <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrates</hi>
for having proſecuted their death, and all of them ſware to mee
they would inviolably execute my deſire. I prayed them beſide, that if <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroſyne</hi>
who was very big, ſhould be brought to bed in the time ſhe were
with them, they would throw into the Sea what ſhould be borne of her,
to extinguiſh for ever this race. After they had promiſed to performe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
all I recommended to them, I made them yet ſome preſents; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
alſo ſome of them, for not ſhewing a contempt of them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
many mutuall proteſtations, they went their way to attend <hi>Hermocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
in the paſſage neare the Port of <hi>Lylibeum.</hi> They fail'd not to accompliſh
faithfully what they had promiſed me: for they tooke away <hi>Hermocrates</hi> and
<hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> but they were wanting onely in this, that they ſold not <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
ſo ſoone as they had aſſured me, but kept him ſome time with his wife
amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>I had no newes what they were all become of, but about foure yeares
after, during which time being rid of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> that before wholly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſed
my ſpirit, I relapſed into the lively reſentment of the evils of my houſe,
and to eaſe them in ſome ſort, I enterpris'd to build a ſtately houſe in the
Countrey; and at the ſame time made a Tower be erected, with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there to incloſe <hi>Acidalia</hi> the remainder of her dayes. But at the end
of thoſe foure yeares, I heard that certaine men demanded to ſpeake with
me. I ſent for them, and knew them to be the very ſame Pyrats, that came
to give me an account of what they had done. They told me they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>Hermocrates</hi> and <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> whom they had not yet beene able to ſell
in place whence they might not returne againe: that when they had <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroſyne,</hi>
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:7768:145"/>
ſhe was already deliver'd of the childe ſhe had beene big with; but
that ſince being with them, ſhe was brought to bed of a daughter, that ſeem'd
ſo faire to them, as they could not reſolve to put it to death: nevertheleſſe,
for not failing in that they promiſed me, they had brought it me to diſpoſe of
as I ſhould thinke good. Then they preſented me this young girle of about
two yeares of age, whoſe beauty ſurpriz'd me: but when ſhe open'd her lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
armes to embrace me in ſaluting, I was touch'd with love and pitty for
her ſake, and reſolv'd with my ſelfe rather to nouriſh it, than be ſo cruell as
I had reſolv'd. I am very ſorry, purſued <hi>Dicearchus,</hi> addreſſing him to <hi>Euphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyne</hi>
and <hi>Melintus,</hi> that I cannot at this time preſent you with this nurſe childe
of my bringing up; 'tis the gentile and courageous <hi>Epicharis,</hi> who is the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> and your ſiſter, ſaid he to <hi>Melintus. Euphroſyne</hi> knew not
who this <hi>Epicharis</hi> was; yet ſhe rejoyc'd that her child had beene preſerved:
but <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Ariana</hi> cried out at the ſame time: <hi>Melintus</hi> ſaid, What, is
<hi>Epicharis</hi> my ſiſter? And <hi>Ariana,</hi> Alas <hi>Melintus,</hi> my deare <hi>Epicharis,</hi> is ſhe then
your ſiſter? Ah! what joy will this newes bring my brother that loves her ſo
paſſionately; and what griefe too will he receive by it for not knowing where
ſhe is? <hi>Dicearchus</hi> caus'd a little ceaſing to all theſe admirations and joyes, in
continuing thus: 'Tis true this young childe made her ſelfe alwayes ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
as I was conſtrain'd to love her maugre the hatred I had againſt thoſe
that brought her into the world. She had a wit ſo gentile and quicke, that ſhe
forc'd me many times to laugh, when I had but ſmall cauſe in <hi>Acidalla's</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
and when ſhe was more advanc'd in age, I was preſſed by ſome of
my friends to marry her, thinking ſhe had bin a ſlave, to one call'd <hi>Aſylas</hi> a
ſervant borne in my houſe: but I had in horror that propoſition; comparing
the nobleneſſe of her bloud, with the baſeneſſe of <hi>Aſylas;</hi> and could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my ſelfe from ſaying, how the gods would never pardon me for mingling
her illuſtrious bloud with another ſo unworthy of her. This ſpeech was well
remarked, and often times after I was preſt by many, and by <hi>Palamede</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
to tell them of what parents ſhe was borne. Never would I tell them any
thing, being willing to reſerve to my ſelfe alwaies the diſpoſition of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
to render her ſuch as I pleas'd. In that time <hi>Acidalia</hi> died, whether ſhe
had given her ſelfe death by poyſon, or it had ſeized on her through diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
being unable any longer to ſupport her miſery, and chiefly ſeeing that
Tower was prepar'd for her: but before ſhe died, ſhe made me ſo many oaths,
that ſhe had not committed the fault I had imagined, as I thinke now the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
I had of it was onely founded upon my jealouſie. She vowed her ſelfe to
the furies to be eternally tormented in hell, if it were true; and deſir'd of me
no other ſatisfaction at her death, but this, that I would loſe that opinion. I
was willing to let her ſoule depart with this contentment, and I have had as
much regret ſince for having cruelly us'd her, as heretofore I was pleas'd with
it; and I was tormented with a new kinde of puniſhment, for before I was
vex'd with the ſenſe of the injurie I thought I had receiv'd of her; but ſince
her death I have bin perſecuted with the ſorrow for thoſe injuries I made her
ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>I had alwaies kept <hi>Epicharis</hi> with her, but at her death I gave her to my
Neece <hi>Ariana,</hi> becauſe ſhe lov'd her: Afterwards having knowne that <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
had beene acknowledg'd the ſonne of <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> there was a renewing
<pb facs="tcp:7768:145"/>
of my fury againſt this bloud I ſo hated: I had reſolved a little before to give
him my Neece in marriage, thinking he had bin ſonne of <hi>Telephus,</hi> and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great affection the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> bare him: but when I knew the truth
of his extraction, the conſideration of his condition ſo highly advanced, in
ſtead of ſerving his deſire, made me not onely loſe the affection I began to
have towards him, but alſo to ſweare his ruine; and ſeeing how it behoved
me firſt to be aſſured of <hi>Ariana</hi> who loved him, I carried her away to <hi>Corinth,</hi>
hoping after I had married her to <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> to returne to <hi>Syracuſe</hi> and deſtroy
<hi>Melintus.</hi> He prevented me by the reſolution he tooke to carry away my
Neece; and as I was incens'd with this affront that made my hatred irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable,
I found my ſelfe aſſiſted by <hi>Trebatius</hi> to purſue him, and I refus'd
not his helpe, though he ſought to put my Nephew to death as well as him.
Indeed I beleev'd then he had beene at <hi>Athens,</hi> and could not imagine hee
could be with <hi>Melintus;</hi> but when I knew that they were together, I would
not have doubted in the ſtate I was in, to ſacrifice <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Ariana</hi> too,
provided I might have revenge. I followed <hi>Trebatius</hi> for this purpoſe, and
animated him as much as was poſſible for me, to the end <hi>Melintus</hi> might not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape
us: but the gods have rendred all the enforcements of my rage unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
and the graces I have ſo many times receiv'd from him, have forc'd me
to confeſſe, not onely that he was belov'd of them and in their protection, but
beſides that, in ſpight of my hate, my fury, and all my reſentments, I was to
have an obligation to him for my life, and to love him too.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemed that having driven out of my ſoule the paſſions that tormented
it, by the reverence I began to beare to the ſecret decrees of the gods, I
might live from henceforth in ſome repoſe; but feeling continuall ſeizures
of repentings that aſſaile and kill me, I perceive well how the gods have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
me a life entirely tragicall, and will not have me ſurvive my miſeries.
They are determin'd for the preſent, that I dye; but ſince death ought to be
the end of my calamity, I pray you let it be alſo the end of the hate you have
cauſe to beare me. You, ſage <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> and you generous <hi>Melintus,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you by what-ever remaines deare to you in the world, to pardon me for
all the evils I have made you ſuffer: lament rather the perpetuall furies of my
miſerable life, than accuſe my actions, or keepe a remembrance of them to
have me in deteſtation. You, my deare Neece, that have ſometimes felt the
effects of my miſeries, pardon me alſo, and obtaine of <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Euphroſyne</hi>
that they would pardon me. Let me carry at leaſt this conſolation downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that though I lived enemy of all the world, yet I died at leaſtwiſe in the
favour of thoſe I moſt afflicted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dicearchus</hi> ended thus in teares, and often interrupting his words with
ſighes that proceeded from his repentance. <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> and <hi>Ariana</hi> could not
refraine weeping: but <hi>Melintus</hi> that had an heart more conſtant, ſpake to him
on this manner: My father, for I will ſo call you, ſince you ſerve for a father
to my deare <hi>Ariana,</hi> ceaſe, I pray you, to afflict your ſelfe and us too, by your
teares and regrets, that give us a ſufficient teſtimony that you have a good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but that the onely misfortune of your life has forced you to hate us, and
our misfortune alone has rendred us the objects of your hatred. <hi>Dicearchus,</hi>
we ſee every day the force of the Deſtinies, that over-rule and conſtraine us
to doe many times actions our natures are repugnant to. But ſince the ſame
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:7768:146"/>
Deſtinies permit you for the preſent to acknowledge your ſelfe, and leave
you at your owne liberty; you muſt now act of your owne accord with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
for to expell the traine of theſe firſt furious paſſions, as ſhame, ſorrow,
and repentance? 'Tis the onely evill you are for the preſent ſenſible of, and
which if you let it take force, will without doubt be your death. <hi>Dicearchus,</hi>
ſhew in this occaſion what bloud you are come of: appeaſe courageouſly theſe
little ſeizures, and enjoy from henceforth with us the repoſe that fortune pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
us. That ſame great courage which your cruell fortune conſtrain'd to
ſerve your furies, would have beene employed in nobler actions, if your life
had beene more happy. Hitherto you have not us'd it but againſt your ſelfe,
now make it ſerve your owne turne. Loſe you the regret of what is paſt, ſince
we are willing to loſe the memory of it. <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> commands you this, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
intreats you, and I conjure you. Then they confirmed what <hi>Melintus</hi> ſaid,
in embracing, and praying him to take heart: But <hi>Dicearchus</hi> feeling his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
growne to ſuch a point as he could not now vanquiſh it, aſſured them that
they were not to hope he could live any longer; yet that he died with much
comfort, ſince with ſo good a heart they pardon'd him.</p>
                  <p>After ſome other diſcourſe, they reſolv'd to leave him to his reſt, and every
one retir'd to goe to bed; <hi>Melintus</hi> having judged that he was to have a little
ſleepe, to doe his duty the better in the battell that was to be given the day
after. <hi>Dicearchus</hi> died three or foure houres after: <hi>Melintus,</hi> when he knew
of this accident, aroſe to goe comfort <hi>Ariana,</hi> and after having ſpent ſome time
in that duty, he recommended it to the ſage <hi>Lepantus,</hi> with the guard of what
they had both moſt deare in the City, while he himſelfe thought of nothing
but fighting. He parted before day to goe finde <hi>Palamede,</hi> whom at the ſame
time he told very ſad newes, learning him the death of <hi>Dicearchus;</hi> and other
as agreeable, relating how <hi>Epicharis</hi> was his ſiſter. This intelligence made
him loſe the griefe for his uncles death; and he was ſo raviſh'd with knowing
this good fortune for his deare <hi>Epicharis,</hi> wherein he had a great participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he embrac'd <hi>Melintus</hi> a thouſand times, and prayed him to promiſe
him ſhe might be his wife. <hi>Melintus</hi> eſteem'd himſelfe very happy for having
wherewith to acquit himſelfe towards him, for the aſſiſtance he had given him
beſides <hi>Ariana;</hi> and after ſome other diſcourſe upon this rejoycing, and ſome
regrets for <hi>Epicharis</hi> loſſe, they gave over that entertainment to think of aray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their troops in good order, and preparing themſelves that day to atchieve
actions worthy the great reputation they had acquired.</p>

that was neceſſary to containe the front of an Army, and for this cauſe after
they had taken up that ſpace, they were reſolv'd to goe aſſaile their enemies
by ſome skirmiſhes of horſe, to draw them thi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her in feining a flight, to the
end they might afterwards have ſuch advantage of place to fight in, as they
deſir'd. <hi>Alcydamas</hi> and <hi>Polydore</hi> were that day armed with the rich Armes
thoſe of <hi>Lariſſa</hi> had preſented them with, and had not forgot to dreſſe them
in rich skarfes, and to be cover'd with plumes, that they might be the more
remarkable to thoſe they commanded, and in an eſtate worthy of the brave
actions they deſir'd to performe.</p>
               <p>The Army preſently tooke up the place that was deſtin'd for the fight,
and the troops being embattell'd, the Chiefs began to walke about the ranks
to encourage their ſouldiers. The valiant <hi>Alcydamas</hi> ſeem'd that day higher
than uſually, and had a certaine ſparkling in his eyes, and ſplendour upon
his face, that made him appeare like unto ſome god deſcended from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for the ſuccours of <hi>Greece,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. They ſaw waving his
white and carnation plumes over the ranks he exceeded by the head, and his
mine alone ſeem'd to inſpire a part of his great courage into thoſe that were
ready to fight under his command. At length, willing to ſpeake to his men,
before ſending out a party to the skirmiſh, he commanded ſilence, and with
an agreeable and aſſured voyce ſpake thus to them:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:7768:147"/>
FEllow Souldiers, if I ſpeake to you, 'tis not that I doubt of your courage, nor that
I deſire to provoke it more, but rather to expreſſe to you the contentment I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in ſeeing my ſelfe aſsiſted with ſo generous troops. I hope this day to make the
<hi>Romans</hi> confeſſe, what their good fortune is to have the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> for guards to
the limits of their Empire: for I am aſſured, ſeeing the ardour of fighting which
appeares on your faces, they will be beholding to us for this dayes victory. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
you, that we are in that <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> which hath alwayes beene fatall for great
exploits of warre, which hath ſeene heretofore decided the quarrell for the Empire of
the Vniverſe, betweene two of the greateſt Captaines of the world. Let us ſhew as much
valour this day, as thoſe famous warriers did, in fighting for cauſes farre more juſt
than theirs: They ruin'd the world to remaine Maſters of it, but your fight is to
preſerve your Countrey from the fury of Barbarians. They were not moved but by
a violent ambition; but you are animated with a generous piety, deſirous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
your Altars, your parents, and your deareſt Countrey. Let us goe then, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
in Armes, let us on to goe ſwim in the rivers of bloud we ſhall make theſe
bruitiſh Nations ſhed, whoſe number will but ſerve to augment our trophees and
our glory. Let us make them feele with our ſwords, a regret for having dared to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
ſo warlike a province. Follow me, companions. But what is this? You will be
gone already: I will follow you then, and labour by imitating you to ſerve the valiant
<hi>Theſſalians</hi> in the acquiſition of an immortall glory.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Alcydamas</hi> had thus ſpoken, all his company lift up their ſwords on
high, to expreſſe to him the deſire they had he ſhould lead them on to the
combat: preſently he commanded ſome of his troops to goe charge the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
and feine by little and little to flye, that they might draw them to the
place where they were. The Barbarians received them with great cries, and
ſeeing they were ſo few a number, purſued them by ſhot of arrowes with all
the body of their Army, that approached the <hi>Romans</hi> within ſhot. Then
<hi>Maxentius</hi> ſent to command <hi>Alcydamas</hi> and <hi>Polydore</hi> to goe charge them, to the
end the Barbarians ſhould not have the honour of the firſt chocque. They
both parted in the head of their troops, and with ſuch fury ruſhed upon the
<hi>Scythians,</hi> that they brake through the two wings of their Battalion which
they had formed in the figure of a Creſcent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Alcydamas</hi> having foreſeene that
it was neceſſary for him to make a great ſlaughter, had provided a broad
ſword of fine mettall, that no kinde of Armes was able to reſiſt: ſo as being
manag'd by a ſtrong and able arme, it cut off all it reached, and the field was
ſpread all over with heads, armes, legs, and trunked bodies. <hi>Polydore</hi> alſo on
his ſide gave no little proofes of his valour, and the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> courageouſly
followed ſo valiant Leaders, and cut in peeces whatſoever preſented it ſelfe
before them. The <hi>Romans</hi> ſeeing ſo happy a beginning, avanc'd their point,
and went to ſet upon that part of the <hi>Scythians</hi> Army that was oppoſite to
them, for to ſecond the happy ſucceſſe of the horſe. <hi>Alcydamas</hi> in the meane
time continued his great blowes, and put all the encountred either to the
edge of the ſword, or into diſorder: in the end with the aſſiſtance of his
companions, he was come to the middeſt of the enemies left wing, from
whence he began to perceive ſomewhat a farre off a troop of <hi>Scythians</hi> that
ſtood cloſe round about one that ſurpaſſed them by the head, and had all the
<pb facs="tcp:7768:147"/>
marks of being their King. There it was he ſet up his reſt for his deſignes,
and becauſe his horſe began to faile being all over pierc'd with arrowes, he
mounted upon one of thoſe were held ready for him, and having emboldned
his company to follow him, he thruſt towards that body which he ſoone
opened by force of blowes, and pierced with two or three of his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
onely to the very place where the King was, accompanied with the
ſtrength of his Army. Then his ſword did exploits to be admir'd, for theſe
great bodies oppos'd themſelves before their King, and he was to kill many
of them before he could come neare him. But at laſt he ſtrucke downe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
at his feet, as he came to encounter with the King, who refus'd not the
Combat: he a long time defended himſelfe with a great deale of courage,
and gave <hi>Alcydamas</hi> many a blow to make him feele the weight of his arme:
nevertheleſſe the valiant <hi>Alcydamas</hi> after he had weakned him by divers
wounds, ſtrucke ſo many blowes upon his caſque, as it fell in peeces; then he
divided in two the head of this barbarous Prince, that fell downe at his feet.
The reſt of <hi>Alcydamas</hi> company came up at the ſame time, and admired the
great ſlaughter he had made: Then the Barbarians could no longer ſuſtaine
them, and tooke their flight. <hi>Alcydamas</hi> purſued them, inceſſantly killing
thoſe he could overtake. He chas'd them as farre as to the Sea, where a party
of the <hi>Scythians</hi> ſav'd themſelves in their ſhipping, and this element was the
ſole bound of his victory.</p>
               <p>The fortune of <hi>Polydore</hi> had bin very neare equall to this, for having alſo
brake through thoſe of the point that was oppoſite to him, he had made a
ſtrange carnage of them, and ſtill purſued the remainder that ran away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sea, where they were receiv'd by <hi>Alcydamas</hi> and cut in peeces.
Theſe two friends thus encountring, bound themſelves together with their
victorious armes, and held a long time one another embraced, rejoycing that
they met againe, and thanking the gods for ſo great a victory. <hi>Polydore</hi> onely
had a wound of an arrow that ſtrucke him into the thigh; they ſtayed the
bloud of it, and preſently after they rallied all that had followed them, and
found how they had not loſt ſo many as fifty men of the horſe they led: but
they ſaw themſelves accompanied but with about three thouſand of the foot
that had followed them; and wondred to ſee none of the <hi>Romans</hi> among
them. They reſolv'd to returne into the field of the battell, where they
found indeed a great number of <hi>Scythians</hi> ſlaine, but againe the greater part
of the <hi>Romans</hi> killed, whoſe fortune had bin very differing from theirs: for
they learn'd of ſome ſouldiers that were left for dead, that when they van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd
on their ſides, the <hi>Scythians</hi> battalion that was in the middeſt, had
broken through the battell of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and after having ſlaine the greateſt
part of it, purſued the reſt into the Towne. Then <hi>Alcydamas</hi> complain'd at
his misfortune, that his heat ſhould ſo carry him away with the deſire of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with his owne hand the King of the <hi>Scythians;</hi> for had it not beene for
this encounter, he would never have quitted his care for the groſſe of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and had not fail'd to have ſuccour'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> having alwayes before
taken heed to what paſſed. Inſtantly be intreated them that remain'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him, and in a ſhort time he came with his little troop into the City,
where the Barbarians were peſle-meſle entred in with the flyers, and began
to pillage on all ſides, after having ſlaine all that had reſiſted their fury. There
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:7768:148"/>
was but the Caſtle that held out ſtill, whereinto <hi>Arimin</hi> had ſhut himſelfe.
<hi>Alcydamas</hi> began to put to the ſword all the <hi>Scythians</hi> he encountred, and
made a fearefull butchery of them, becauſe they dream'd of nought but pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laging.
He beſtrewed the ſtreets with bodies of theſe Barbarians, who fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
an enemy ſo little expected, betooke them to their heeles every where.
And thoſe very men that kept <hi>Arimin</hi> beſieg'd, thought them to be gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
from heaven to the <hi>Romans</hi> ayd, not able to judge from whence theſe
enemies ſhould come upon them, and ran away alſo. The night approaching
favour'd the <hi>Scythians</hi> retreat, and hindred <hi>Alcydamas</hi> from carrying away
with <hi>Polydore</hi> the honour of two great victories in one day, and of entirely
defeating the great number of the Barbarians. They were not willing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
them out of the Towne, for feare of forſaking it; but taking care for the
preſervation of what remain'd, they made the gates be ſhut up, then they ſet
guards every where, thinking onely to defend themſelves, and all the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
that were then found within the City were taken priſoners. <hi>Alcydamas</hi>
having given order on all ſides, went with <hi>Polydore</hi> to the Caſtle to finde the
Commanders, and adviſe of what was to be done. There he learn'd how
<hi>Maxentius, Flavian,</hi> and <hi>Milo</hi> had beene ſlaine in the fight; and <hi>Arimin</hi> told
him that he had receiv'd certaine <hi>Romans</hi> into the Caſtle, with whom he had
a long time defended himſelfe. That Governour obliged to <hi>Alcydamas</hi> for
his owne ſafety, and the preſervation of the Towne, received with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
embraces this glorious Conquerour, and gave him as many commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for having done ſo great exploits: after their kindneſſes were ended,
they aſſembled in counſell to deliberate of what they had to doe, after ſo
great a defeat on either party. Every one concurr'd in opinion with the ſage
<hi>Alcydamas,</hi> who conſidering that there remain'd no more of them but about
five thouſand men, and that they had not ſlaine above the halfe part of their
enemies, ſaid they were by all meanes to avoyd fighting, for feare of hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the entire loſſe of the Towne, but that it was neceſſary to attend the
troops that were comming to them out of <hi>Achaia,</hi> wherewith they might
chace away what remain'd of theſe barbarous people. When they were upon
this reſolution, there was brought them a <hi>Greeke</hi> that had bin taken amongſt
the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who ſaid he had ſomething of importance to communicate
with thoſe that commanded the Towne. This man being before <hi>Arimin,</hi>
ſeem'd to be an old man of a good aſpect, that had ſaved himſelfe from the
<hi>Scythians</hi> to be deliver'd out of their hands, and having knowne that there
were ſo few men left in <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> was come to advertiſe <hi>Arimin</hi> to keepe his
men from going out of the City to fight: becauſe there was nothing ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
as theſe Barbarians in deſperation, and he was certaine that they would
depart after ſo great an overthrow, being not able to vanquiſh all the forces
of <hi>Greece.</hi> This good old man ſeem'd to have a great care over the <hi>Romans</hi> and
<hi>Greeks,</hi> and prayed them with earneſt affection, that none would endanger
themſelves, whether out of an hope of defeating the remainder of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,
or out of vaine-glory to ſhew their courage in attempting ſome har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
action, to get themſelves a name before their enemies retreat. But he had
no trouble to perſwade thoſe that were already reſolved not to fight, for
putting any thing to the hazard. Then they diſcourſed of ſome young mens
actions, who to acquire honour had oftentimes endanger'd their whole party.
<pb facs="tcp:7768:148"/>
Thereupon they alleag'd the lawes of the <hi>Romans</hi> that had provided a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for ſuch faults, ordaining death to thoſe that ſhould fight againſt their
Generall's command, although they return'd victorious; and ſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
hereof were produced. The old man that had a long time liv'd amongſt
the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who had oblig'd him to ſerve for a ſacrificer to their gods, ſaid
that theſe Barbarians, although they were unfurniſhed with learning, were
not wanting to eſtabliſh lawes, which, for all they ſavour'd a little of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſme,
were nevertheleſſe founded upon a great deale of reaſon; as it might
be ſeene by that they had made againſt private Captaines, who without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſhould fight with the enemy: for they puniſhed with death their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
although they had bin happy in ſucceſſe, and this kinde of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was very ſtrange and remarkable; for they led this miſerable Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in a Chariot through all the City as it were in triumph: The ſouldiers
that had ſerv'd him in the action went before, and carried the ſpoyles they
had gained; after this Chariot followed the Prieſt with thoſe that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd
for the ſacrifice; and a little after the hangman with an hatchet: in
the middeſt of the City was a Scaffold, whereupon ſtood a little Altar where
they laid him that had offended upon his backe, and the Prieſt opened his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,
and tooke out his heart to be honourably burned in a fire that was
kindled of the enemies arrowes; afterwards his head was cut off by the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
to ſhew that the heart which was the ſeat of courage, ought to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
for having done a brave action, but that the head where government
conſiſts, was to be puniſh'd for having failed to obey the commandement.
This law was found to be very fantaſticall, and yet they ſaid it had in it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
very reaſonable: whereupon many having made other diſcourſes, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
to expreſſe he would have a great care of the lives of thoſe Chiefs that
remain'd, ſwore he would make that <hi>Scythian</hi> law be obſerv'd, if any one
ſhould be ſo deſperate as to fight againſt the prohibition he had given to the
contrary. All the Captaines to ſhew that they would inviolably obey what he
commanded, ſwore they would not fight but by his order, upon paine of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
the rigour of that very law. <hi>Arimin</hi> told them after, that if the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
went not ſo ſoone away, and he found a fit occaſion to make a ſally,
he would not refuſe to give them meanes to make their valours appeare: but
that they ſhould not expect any ſuch permiſſion untill foure dayes were expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
After this diſcourſe they made the old man be carefully look'd to, for
feare he proved a lyer in the aſſurance he gave, that the <hi>Scythians</hi> would be
gone before two dayes: then every man retir'd to his owne home, to repoſe
him after ſo many travels endur'd in this great day of battell.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Alcydamas</hi> and <hi>Polydore</hi> were come into their lodging, <hi>Euphroſyne</hi>
came to meet her ſonne, to embrace him, and expreſſe the joy ſhe had to ſee
him return'd from ſo great dangers. He would have gone into <hi>Ariana's</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> told him that ſhe and <hi>Cyllenia</hi> were aſleepe together, and
prayed him to let them reſt after ſo many paines and feares they had ſuffer'd;
how the <hi>Scythians</hi> had aſſaulted this houſe before they two return'd into the
Towne, and that <hi>Lepantus</hi> after he had valiantly defended it, was left hurt of
many wounds, which nevertheleſſe were not very dangerous. They would
have gone to ſee <hi>Lepantus,</hi> but <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> conjur'd them to goe to their reſt,
and remit all viſits and entertainments till the next day. She oblig'd them
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7768:149"/>
thus to goe to bed: for never had they ſo much need of ſleeping as then, and
they gave it not over untill the day was already well forward the next
morning.</p>
               <p>This repoſe was very neceſſary for <hi>Alcydamas,</hi> as well to refreſh him after
his travels, as to reſiſt the troubles and griefes he was to receive at his awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
<hi>Euphroſyne</hi> was then conſtrain'd to tell him that <hi>Ariana</hi> had bin carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away by the <hi>Scythians,</hi> but that ſhe was not willing he ſhould know this
newes the night before, to give him at leaſt ſome time to repoſe in. That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that <hi>Lepantus</hi> had defended them with a great deale of valour, he had bin
left for dead, and but for the ſuccours he and <hi>Polydore</hi> brought into the Town,
they had all bin taken priſoners: but the Barbarians finding themſelves preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
tooke away <hi>Ariana</hi> onely. This cruell newes ſeized him with ſuch a griefe,
as he remain'd in bed without either voyce or colour, and was a good while
immoveable; but returning out of the aſtoniſhment which ſo unfortunate a
blow had given him; Ah fortune, ſaid he, how cruell art thou to me? And
have I killed ſo many of the Barbarians, have I gained two famous victories
in one day, and could not keepe my ſelfe from loſing the deareſt treaſure of
my life? Have I preſerv'd a whole Countrey, and peradventure all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire from the fury of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and was not able to conſerve what
was moſt precious to me upon earth? Ah! <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> ah! my friends, why
did you not advertiſe me yeſterday of this accident that I might have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Barbarians at the ſame time; and ſince I knew how to ſave this City
out of their hands, I could as well have delivered <hi>Ariana</hi> from them. <hi>Ariana,</hi>
my deare <hi>Ariana<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> where are you? What will you now ſay of me, for being ſo
unworthy as not to have come to your ayd? Muſt a <hi>Scythian</hi> dare to have
touch'd with his profane hands ſo faire a perſon? and ſome execrable Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian
make her it may be at this preſent feele the effects of his brutiſhneſſe?
O cruell thought, O griefe, O rage! But no, without doubt ſhe is dead by
this time: that generous ſoule would either have prevented ſo ſenſible an
outrage by death, or elſe not have ſurviv'd her honour. Faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> if it be
true that thou art no more upon earth, but either beeſt now ſome new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation,
or receiv'd into the company of goddeſſes, pardon me the coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
for not ſuccouring thee, pardon me, deare <hi>Ariana.</hi> But how canſt thou
ever excuſe this crime that makes me unworthy of the very remembrance to
have lov'd thee? No, 'tis certaine, that for the preſent thou regardeſt me
with contempt: thou ſeeſt how little I deſerv'd the honour of thy friendſhip,
and how the heaven alone was worthy of thee. Thou haſt reaſon for this, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Ariana,</hi> and I thinke my ſelfe no more worthy to look up to heaven that
poſſeſſes thee. I will dye, to take from the world a man ſo unworthy to live:
but firſt I will avenge thy death upon this beaſtly Nation. I will erect Tombes
and Pyramids for thee with the ſlaughtered bodies of theſe Barbarians, and
make them waſh away their impiety in rivers of their owne bloud. Great
goddeſſe, I will have all places of the earth where I ſhall encounter them
become thy Altars, whereupon I will offer up to thee bloudy ſacrifices; and
after having ſacrific'd my ſelfe too for a finall oblation, I will goe downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
to mourne eternally for the crime I have committed in abandoning thee.
<hi>Alcydamas,</hi> after having vented in his griefe and rage many ſuch like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
leap'd at once out of his bed, not knowing what reſolution he ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:7768:149"/>
take upon ſo cruell an accident. He call'd for his clothes, and by and by his
Armes, continually changing his determination, and appearing as one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all ſenſe. <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> endevour'd to reſtore his wits by comforting him,
and would have bin glad the ſage <hi>Lepantus</hi> had bin in ſtate to have moved him
to take ſome conſtant reſolution. She told him that he ought not yet to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire
of any thing, and that peradventure <hi>Ariana</hi> had bin left in ſome other
part of the Towne; that they were to ſearch in all places, before they lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this misfortune as certaine. So was there a ſearch made with great care;
but all that diligence proved in vaine. <hi>Polydore</hi> offered himſelfe to goe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
by night with <hi>Arcas</hi> into the <hi>Scythians</hi> Camp, and to looke about on all
ſides, if they might not finde her ſome where among them: <hi>Alcydamas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
had ſome deſire to goe thither, and try this meanes; but every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
how they expos'd themſelves to manifeſt danger without any great
appearance of finding her, they were deſired to ſtay a while untill fortune
preſented ſome other occaſion, and by hope to moderate the cares and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
for ſo grievous a loſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcydamas</hi> went up to the walls of the Towne, that he might diſcover
what the enemies were doing, and he ſaw how after they were return'd into
their Camp, they began to remove thence all they had to carry it into their
veſſels, and look'd like people that were diſpos'd to depart the day after. This
ſight ſtrucke a thouſand griefes into him: for he imagin'd they would never
ſuffer him to goe out and fight with them, ſince they made ſhew of going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
and that if <hi>Ariana</hi> were once carried into <hi>Scythia,</hi> he ſhould never more
heare of her. Then he revolv'd within his minde a thouſand differing
thoughts, and caſt a thouſand deſignes that were found at laſt to have no
ſure foundation at all. In theſe perplexed ſtudies was he, when one of thoſe
that commanded the guard over the ports, brought him a man that deſir'd
to ſpeake with him. <hi>Alcydamas</hi> knowing it was <hi>Amyntas,</hi> ran to embrace him,
ſighing. And <hi>Amyntas</hi> told him in private, that within two dayes <hi>Eurymedon</hi>
would be with him and three thouſand men of warre. Alas! ſaid <hi>Alcydamas,
Eurymedon</hi> comes too late for me. Know, deare <hi>Amyntas,</hi> that the <hi>Scythians</hi>
are gone to morrow, or the day after at the furtheſt, and carry away <hi>Ariana</hi>
with them. <hi>Ariana?</hi> replied <hi>Amyntas</hi> all-amaz'd: ah gods! what misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
is this! <hi>Alcydamas</hi> could not refraine weeping, and conducted him home
to his houſe, making his complaints and regrets to him by the way: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
he intreated him to let no body know for what occaſion he was come,
becauſe he might ſome way or other make uſe of his arrivall. <hi>Amyntas</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to keepe it ſecret, and told him how <hi>Theſſaly</hi> alone had not bin aſſaulted
by theſe Barbarians, but the Iſland alſo whence he came, but that they were
happily beaten out of it. They were come into the houſe, where <hi>Amyntas</hi>
after he had ſaluted <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> rejoyced much to ſee her againe, but more yet
to underſtand that ſhe was mother to <hi>Alcydamas,</hi> and he eſteem'd himſelfe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
happy for having rendred him this ſervice in her deliverance: but ſeeing
<hi>Alcydamas</hi> to ſtand in need of divertments, he reſolv'd to relate what adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
had be fallen him ſince he left them in <hi>Epire.</hi> Being ſet downe therefore

                  <head>Continuation of the Hiſtory of Eurymedon and Paſithea.</head>
                  <p>WHen you ſhall underſtand what proſperity hath accompanied us in
our voyages, I doubt not but you will have cauſe enough to envy us,
and complaine againſt fortune that has ſo cruelly perſecuted you, at the ſame
time ſhe intreated us ſo favourably.</p>
                  <p>At my arrive in <hi>Corcyra,</hi> I found a great preparation of warre was making
in favour of <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> for whoſe returne all the Pyrats had bin ſo joyfull, as
it was no difficult matter for him to have obtain'd whatever he could deſire
at their hands. Some were buſied in furniſhing of ſhips, others in providing
good Armes, and all of them expreſſed as much joy to goe ſerve their Prince,
as if they had beene aſſured of the Conqueſt of all <hi>Aſia.</hi> I found <hi>Eurymedon</hi>
in the Iſle, ranking his men into battell, for to learne them to fight as well
by land as they did by Sea. As ſoone as he perceiv'd me, he came to meet
me, and after embracing ask'd me newes of you. I told him in what eſtate
you were, and the need you had of his ſuccours: and for this cauſe he adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd
his men that they were to depart the next day, and told me I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
and aſſure you that the day after he would come with his forces to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copolis,</hi>
whence he made no doubt but he ſhould deliver you, and that from
thence you might together take the way of <hi>Lesbos:</hi> nevertheleſſe he would
keepe me the reſt of the day, to the end I might depart by night, and doe
him a pleaſure in my returne. I expreſt to him how glad I ſhould be to have
an occaſion of ſerving him: and about evening he gave me <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> and
deſir'd me to carry her ſecretly into my Skiffe, to ſave her from the Pyrats,
recommending her to me with as much affection as if ſhe had bin his mother.
I tooke my leave of him, and came to <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> where I found you not in
the lodging I left you in, and what care ſoever I tooke, I could never know
what was become of you. I left <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> in the houſe, and the next day I
went to the Port, where I ſaw a ſhip arriving, wherein was <hi>Eurymedon,</hi>
who came to know what was neceſſary to be done, before he made the reſt
of his little Army appeare. I told him I could not finde you in the City, but
that I knew <hi>Trebatius</hi> was yet there, who had heard no newes of you, and that
without all doubt you had found ſome other meanes of ſaving your ſelves.
We thought it in vaine to ſtay there any longer. <hi>Eurymedon</hi> ask'd me if <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phreſyne</hi>
were in a ſure place. I told him I had left her at the ſame lodging
where we had dwelt together. He gave me ſome commodities he had ſent
for out of his veſſell, to carry her: then he inquir'd of me what I meant to
doe. I ſignified to him that my friends being departed thence, I had no more
buſineſſe there; and how I ſhould be very glad to wait on him to <hi>Lesbos.</hi> He
was very well content I would ſerve him in that occaſion, and after I had bin
to ſee <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> and carry her all things ſhe might have need of, I return'd
to finde him, and we parted from the haven together; then having met with
his other ſhipping that attended him, we began to ſet ſaile. The wind was ſo
favourable, that in a few dayes we paſſed round about the Peloponeſe, and
having paſs'd the Egean Sea, arriv'd happily in the Iſland, where <hi>Eurymedon</hi>
advis'd to land upon the coaſts, and not at the haven.</p>
                  <p>The ſhore was ſo deſert, as we had much adoe to find a man there that could
<pb facs="tcp:7768:150"/>
tell us in what eſtate the affaires of the Countrey were: nevertheleſſe in the
end we encountred certaine perſons that ſought for a retreat in thoſe inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
places, who told us how a great number of <hi>Scythians</hi> were come to land
in the Iſle to pillage it, and that the King <hi>Archelaus</hi> was reſolv'd to give them
battell, having many ſtranger Princes with him that came to the deliverance
of the Princeſſe <hi>Paſithea,</hi> and were opportunely met with for the ſafety of the
Iſland, and expulſion of the Barbarians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eurymedon</hi> learning this newes could not tell what to reſolve on; he had
a great deſire to goe and preſent himſelfe to the King, to ſerve him in the day
of battell; but he fear'd his indignation. Beſides, he knew not how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
at the combat, without being knowne: On the other ſide it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for him to ſtay in the Countrey and not be met with, either by the
<hi>Scythians,</hi> or <hi>Archelaus;</hi> and we had in all but foure thouſand men, with
which we could not reſiſt a great Army; at laſt he bethought himſelfe of this
ſubtilty: You know he is very young, and extremely handſome, he reſolv'd
to diſguiſe himſelfe into a Maid, ſo to goe finde the King before he could
know him, and to tell <hi>Archelaus</hi> that he was daughter to the King of <hi>Thrace,</hi>
whom the <hi>Scythians</hi> had maſſacred, after they had pillag'd his kingdome, and
how ſhe had found meanes to ſave her ſelfe out of their fury, with a few ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ſhe brought with her; that ſeeking for refuge at his Court, ſhe was glad
to finde occaſion at her arrive to ſuccour him, and be reveng'd upon this
cruell people for her fathers death. His plot being thus laid, he choſe out
the youngeſt of his ſouldiers to be diſguis'd alſo, and repreſent the Maids of
her traine; and becauſe I have yet no haire on my face, he prayed me to be
one of that number. By good fortune he had made ſome proviſion of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
clothes that were very fine, having a deſigne to carry away <hi>Paſithea,</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſhe might need them, going ſo unprovided away with him; and this
happened very luckily for him and us too. I ſweare to you, when he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a juppe, and dreſt up his haire which he wore very long in treſſes, I was
deceiv'd in him my ſelfe; and I know few women that would have exceeded
him in beauty. He arm'd himſelfe onely with a corſlet and a caske, having his
ſword by his ſide, and a javelin in his hand. He commanded all thoſe that were
diſguis'd with him, to put themſelves in the ſame equipage; ſo we landed
ſome horſes out of the ſhips, whereupon being mounted we went in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the head of our troops towards <hi>Mitylene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We had ſcarce gone halfe the way, when we perceiv'd armed horſemen
that ran ſcatter'd about as if they were ſufficiently out of heart; wee ſtayed
ſome of them, that told us how the Armies of <hi>Archelaus</hi> and the <hi>Scythians</hi>
were joyned, and that the King was very neare to be defeated. <hi>Eurymedon</hi>
made the place be ſhewne him where the battell was given, and preſently he
commanded us to advance and ayd that Prince. We arriv'd inſtantly at a hill
from whence we viewed the combat, and having knowne the Kings troops
that were in great diſorder, we ran to ayd them, which we did ſo opportunely
as the vanquiſhed began to take heart againe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eurymedon</hi> in a moment open'd the Squadrons of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and his
womans habit made his blowes appeare more marvellous: I followed him
cloſe, endevouring to imitate his valour, and at laſt we came to the very
ſtrength of the battel, where the King was fallen from his horſe, and defended
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7768:151"/>
onely with two or three ſouldiers, that with much adoe ſuſtain'd a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Scythians. Eurymedon</hi> kill'd foure or five Barbarians that ſeem'd to be
the moſt obſtinate, and, while I undertooke the reſt, alighted from his horſe,
and addreſſing himſelfe to the King, ſaid to him; Courage, <hi>Archelaus,</hi> aſſure
thy ſelfe thou ſhalt this day be victor. At the ſame time he help'd him up his
horſe againe, and remounting upon his owne, they went together to charge
the Barbarians that began to tremble.</p>
                  <p>The King had alwayes his eyes fixed upon this unknowne warrioureſſe,
and knew not from whence this ſuccours came. He admir'd the blowes were
given by the arme of this generous Maid, and could not beleeve but that it
was <hi>Pallas</hi> her ſelfe who was come to his defence. I will not relate to you all
the particular encounters of this battell: in the end we remain'd van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhers;
and after we were return'd from chaſing the flying enemies, the
King receiv'd <hi>Eurymedon</hi> with as much reſpect as if he had bin a goddeſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:
but he not willing to keepe him in that errour, told him, he was the
daughter of the King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> with all he had premeditated, adding that he
never receiv'd ſo much joy, as in puniſhing theſe Barbarians for the death of
his father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Archelaus</hi> tooke the boldneſſe then to embrace him in quality of a Princeſſe,
and told him that ſince he had drawne ſo great an advantage from her fathers
calamity, and her owne, he intreated her in like manner to diſpoſe of all ſhe
had conſerv'd to him. Great King, ſaid this diſguis'd Princeſſe, I demand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of you but a retreat within your territories, and that I may live with
you in a ranke worthy of my birth. The Prince that already felt himſelfe
touch'd with love, ſayes to her, that it was in her owne power to hold the
higheſt degree in his kingdome her ſex was capable of, and that hee would
make her Miſtreſſe of his eſtates, and of his perſon too, if it pleas'd her. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rymedon</hi>
would not loſe this occaſion, and ſaid to him; The fortune I am in
forbids me to hope for ſuch an honour: nevertheleſſe ſince that you are in
permits you all things, I accept the offer you make me, and I intreat you well
to remember your ſelfe of it, when I ſhall challenge you of your promiſe.
He ſware to her he would never faile her, and that it would be no difficult
matter for him to effect what he deſired himſelfe with ſo much paſſion. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Princes arriv'd at the ſame time, and ſeem'd to deſire ſomething of the
King, who ſeeing their impatiency, told <hi>Eurymedon</hi> (that had nam'd himſelfe
<hi>Hermione,)</hi> how theſe Princes expected his judgement; becauſe he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
them, that he that ſhewed the moſt valour that day, ſhould have in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
the Princeſſe <hi>Paſithea</hi> his daughter. <hi>Eurymedon</hi> bluſh'd at that diſcourſe,
being angry he had not appear'd at the battell in the habit of a man, becauſe
none could more lawfully have pretended this honour, than himſelfe. The
King perceiv'd his redneſſe, and ask'd him the cauſe of it. I wil tell it you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, anſwered <hi>Hermione:</hi> but let us ſee whom you wil give the Princeſſe
to. If you were a man, ſaid <hi>Archelaus,</hi> without doubt ſhe had bin won by you,
for you are the perſon that has ſhewne the moſt valour; but being it is not ſo,
I will not faile for all that to give you the honour of this victory. Then he
made ſigne to the Princes that he would ſpeake to them, and he pronounc'd
theſe words: Since we are all redeuable to the only courage of the valiant
<hi>Hermione</hi> for the <hi>Scythians</hi> defeat, there is none but ſhe that ought to pretend
<pb facs="tcp:7768:151"/>
any honour; and ſince in the perſon of my daughter the kingdome of <hi>Troas</hi>
and of this Iſle, was deſtin'd to him that ſhould have carried away the prize, I
am obliged by my oath to make <hi>Hermione</hi> Queene of my eſtates, if I were not
oblig'd at all to it by my affection.</p>
                  <p>The Princes were greatly amazed; and though <hi>Hermione</hi> appear'd with
many beauties and graces, yet they could not be ſatisfied with her. The
King tooke her then by the hand, and made her be placed with him in a
Chariot that attended him for his returne to <hi>Mitylene,</hi> with the victorious
troops that accompanied him. The people that was advertis'd how the King
deſir'd to many this Princeſſe, already called her their Queene; whereat
<hi>Eurymedon</hi> ſmiled within himſelfe. <hi>Archelaus</hi> having her beſide him, would
know what reaſon ſhe had to bluſh when ſhe heard ſpeake of his daughter <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſithea.</hi>
Becauſe, anſwer'd ſhe, I beleev'd you had had no children, and that
word ſurpriz'd me. I have, ſayes he, but this daughter, though it would be
better for me I had her not, for the diſpleaſure I have receiv'd by her: then
he fetch'd a deepe ſigh. <hi>Hermione</hi> demanded what cauſe ſhe had given him to
complaine of her. A while ſince, anſwers <hi>Archelaus,</hi> a young ſtranger came
to land in this Iſle, and after I had receiv'd him with much honour, he knew
ſo well how to gaine her, as he made her in love with him. This villaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded
my anger by flying away, and I was conſtrain'd to ſhut up my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for ever in a place where ſhe can never heare more newes of him. I pitty
you indeed, ſayes <hi>Hermione,</hi> if ſhe were ſo unfortunate as to have offended
her honour. I doe not thinke, replies the King, ſhe has ſo farre forgot her
ſelfe: but I ſurpriz'd her one day as this young man, that call'd himſelfe <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rymedon,</hi>
was kiſſing her hand. Ah! great King, returned <hi>Hermione,</hi> this alone
deſerves not ſo cruell a puniſhment. But, continues ſhe, what was this <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rymedon?</hi>
was he a Prince, or elſe a perſon unworthy of the Princeſſe good
graces? He call'd himſelfe Prince truly, anſwers the King, and had many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
qualities; nay, we had ſome obligation to him, my daughter and I:
but very hardly could I have beene aſſured if he were of Royall blood, ſince
he knew it not himſelfe; and it was too much boldneſſe for him to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the ſearch of my daughter without my conſent, ſeeing fortune had
given him nothing whereupon he might ground that hope. Love, ſayes <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mione</hi>
to him, hath not all thoſe conſiderations, and the faults he is ſubject
to, are rather excuſable errours than crimes: and if this <hi>Eurymedon</hi> had ſome
good qualities, I doe not finde that the Princeſſe hath committed ſo great a
fault; and intreat you by the affection you expreſſe to me, not to be ſo cruell
to your owne blood, but to ſet her at liberty in my favour. <hi>Archelaus</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to oblige <hi>Hermione,</hi> and promiſed to deliver her before eight dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe deſired it.</p>
                  <p>He led her into the Palace, where ſhe was lodged as if already ſhee had
beene the Queene, and all the Princeſſes, and the Ladies came to doe their
reverence to her. <hi>Hermione</hi> very well acquitted her ſelfe of all thoſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and ſeem'd to have beene bred in them all her life; but the time ſeem'd
tedious to her untill ſhe ſaw <hi>Paſithea.</hi> Nevertheleſſe ſhe was afraid to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
if ſhe ſpake of her too often to the King. He on the other ſide had
no other wiſh than to be married to <hi>Hermione;</hi> but there was no appearance
of making that marriage, untill firſt he had well provided for the ſafety of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7768:152"/>
his kingdome on all ſides, after the defeat of the <hi>Scythians.</hi> Yet he gave not
over expreſſing to her his impatience, and <hi>Eurymedon</hi> call'd the gods to
witneſſe, and prayed him to beleeve, that he deſir'd the honour of his alliance
as much, or more than he himſelfe. Whereupon the King gave him thanks,
never underſtanding the ſenſe of <hi>Eurymedons</hi> words, who meant the alliance
he deſir'd to make with him by marrying his daughter.</p>
                  <p>At length two dayes after <hi>Hermione</hi> entred into diſcourſe concerning <hi>Paſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi>
and expreſſing a great deſire to ſee her, obtain'd leave of the King to
goe viſit her in the Caſtle where ſhe was kept, upon condition ſhe were not
accompanied but with her Maids. I was one of that number, continued <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myntas,</hi>
ſo as I went with <hi>Hermione</hi> into that Caſtle, which within was guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
onely with women. They all of them ſhewed a great deale of honour
to <hi>Hermione,</hi> knowing ſhe was deſtin'd to be their Queene, and we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to the place where the faire <hi>Paſithea</hi> was, who came out to meet us,
and having heard ſpeake of <hi>Hermione,</hi> and of all that was ſaid concerning her,
ſhe receiv'd her with a very great reſpect, as the perſon ſhe beleev'd ſhe ſhould
one day wholly depend on. <hi>Hermione</hi> embrac'd her, and kiſs'd her a long time;
then having taken her aſide, ask'd her if ſhe remembred not one ſhe had ſeene
very like her. <hi>Paſithea</hi> bluſh'd, and durſt not tell her ſhe reſembled <hi>Eurymedon</hi>
very much, becauſe ſhe fear'd to produce that name before her that very
ſhortly was to be her Queene. <hi>Eurymedon</hi> knew the feare ſhe was in, and for
her re-aſſurance ſaid to her; Faire Princeſſe, feare not to diſcover your ſecret
to me; I am ſiſter of the Prince <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> that am come into this Iſle for
no other end but to ſerve you and my deare brother that dyes for your love.
I have bin ſo happy as to ſuccour the King your father in the battell, and give
him paſſion enough to make him deſire to marry me. But I will never while I
live accord to what he deſires, untill you be firſt married with <hi>Eurymedon.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
anſwer'd <hi>Paſithea</hi> ſomething confounded, I ſhould thinke you meant
but to ſurprize me by theſe words, if I remarked not in you all the features
of <hi>Eurymedons</hi> face; and ſeeing you have beene willing to expreſſe ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
a friendſhip towards him, I will alſo avow to you the extreme love I
beare him, which makes me eſteeme my captivity very pleaſant. <hi>Hermione</hi>
kiſs'd her to ſhew how agreeably ſhe tooke thoſe words, and prayed her to
ſweare <hi>Eurymedon</hi> ſhould be her husband. I doe ſweare it, ſayes ſhe, betweene
your hands, and I promiſe you to give myſelfe to him, as ſoone as ever the
King ſhall have given his conſent.</p>
                  <p>Then they gave one another their hand, and kiſſed a long time: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that diſcourſe being ended, <hi>Paſithea</hi> ſpake of the griefes ſhe had
receiv'd in this priſon, whence <hi>Hermione</hi> promis'd ſhe ſhould very ſpeedily
be delivered, if the King kept his word with her. <hi>Eurymedon</hi> was ſo rapt
with ſeeing his deare Miſtreſſe, and for the errour he kept her in, that he
never ceaſed expreſſing a great contentment to her, and failed not to take
as many kiſſes, as by time ſhe gave him occaſion. But he would proceed
farther yet, and having ſignified to <hi>Paſithea</hi> how willing he would be to be
delivered of her fathers entertainments for a day or two, he ſo wrought with
her, as the Princeſſe thought good he ſhould ſend to the King to aske leave
of him that ſhe might lye that night with his daughter the Princeſſe, becauſe
ſhe could not ſee her ſufficiently to her deſire. I was, went <hi>Amyntas</hi> on, the
<pb facs="tcp:7768:152"/>
chiefe Maid of <hi>Hermione's</hi> traine, and was choſen to goe to King <hi>Archelaus,</hi>
who willingly agreed to what <hi>Hermione</hi> deſir'd, upon condition ſhe retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the day after. I brought them this newes, that was received with a
great deale of joy of them both, but of <hi>Eurymedon</hi> moſt, who under this
diſguiſe hoped to receive the deareſt favours of his faire Miſtreſſe. All the
evening they ceaſed not entertaining one another with much ſatisfaction,
and night being come we undreſſed them. <hi>Paſithea's</hi> Maids had no ſooner
taken off what covered her necke, but <hi>Hermione</hi> brought her mouth thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and told her that her brother had reaſon to be ſo paſſionately in love
with her, and ſhee would never repent her ſelfe for having attempted to
ſerve him for ſo faire a ſubject. <hi>Paſithea</hi> received thoſe kindneſſes and
ſpeeches with a great reſpect, and at laſt we put them into the bed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
It had beene eaſie for mee to have lien alſo with one of the
Princeſſe Maids: but though my will had beene good, I could not have
had the leiſure: for preſently wee heard <hi>Paſithea</hi> cry out. I went with
her Maids to ſee what had happened to her, and when we were about
her, I found her in great trouble to know what ſhe ſhould complaine of:
for <hi>Eurymedon</hi> having told her what he was, and preſs'd her extremely to
grant what he deſir'd, ſhee thought but to have rid her ſelfe out of his
hands; yet ſhee would not accuſe him before the Maids, for feare the
King knew what tricke was played upon him. At laſt ſhee reſolved to
feine that ſhe was taken with violent paines that made her cry out on that
faſhion, and ſhe ſaid, that for feare of troubling <hi>Hermione,</hi> ſhe went to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
into her Maids Chamber. <hi>Eurymedon</hi> ſeeing her reſolution, durſt
not keepe her by him, and ſhee getting out of the bed, went and lock'd
her ſelfe up in a Chamber, where we could not ſee her untill the next
day.</p>
                  <p>He imparted to me all his ſecrets, and told me that very night that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
declared himſelfe to the Princeſſe, ſhe was extremely offended with
his boldneſſe; and though hee laboured to vanquiſh her, by repreſenting
how ſhe had given him her faith, and the King had given them leave to
lye together, yet ſhe would never heare him. In the end that having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriz'd
to employ ſome enforcements, for not loſing ſo faire an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſhe cryed out to have ſome body deliver her out of his hands. He
was afraid ſhe had beene very angry with him: but I aſſured him hee
needed not feare it, and that ſince ſhe had the temper not to accuſe him
before her Maids, it was a ſigne ſhee had ſtill a great affection to him.
The next day hee found to be true what I told him, for feining to goe
ſee how ſhe did, ſhe let her ſelfe a long time be entertain'd by him, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
all his excuſes, then reſolved to be carried away into what part of the
world he would bring her, upon charge that he attempted nothing untill they
were married together by her fathers conſent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eurymedon</hi> was at laſt conſtrain'd to leave her to goe to the King againe:
wee parted from the Caſtle and went to the Palace of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> who
teſtifying much joy to ſee <hi>Hermione,</hi> ask'd her if his daughter had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
her as ſhe deſerved. You have, anſwered ſhee, the lovelieſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the world, and you may judge if I were not ſatisfied with her,
when yeſterday was not ſufficient for me to enjoy her company, but I
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7768:153"/>
muſt have the night added to it. The King replied, Has ſhee not made
you many complaints of mee? Contrariwiſe, returned <hi>Hermione,</hi> wee
ceaſed not commending you for the permiſſion you gave us, for never
had two perſons ſo much inclination to love one another. I rejoyce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,
ſaid <hi>Archelaus,</hi> to have any thing proceed from mee, that is
agreeable to you, and ſhall be very well pleas'd ſhe may keepe you compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and ſerve you all her life time. They had beſides ſome other ſuch
like entertainments, after which <hi>Eurymedon</hi> ſent me to his troops, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe
them to make ready to depart, and that in the meane time they
ſhould have a great care not to diſcover him. I met in the ſtreets with
him you had ſent us, ſaid <hi>Amyntas</hi> to <hi>Melintus,</hi> who had never knowne
mee in the habit I was in; but I was very glad to finde him, becauſe
enquiring after <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> hee might peradventure have given ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition.
I made my ſelfe knowne to him, and he told mee the place where
you were, and for what cauſe you ſent him: I promiſed him to ſpeake
of it to <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> and to diſpoſe him to bring you his forces when we had
taken away the Princeſſe, and having conducted him to our ſhipping, I gave
him charge to attend me there.</p>
                  <p>When I was return'd to <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> he received much joy to know in
what place you were, and to have the meanes to ayd you; for having
the Princeſſe away with him, he might commodiouſly enough goe land
in <hi>Theſſaly:</hi> nevertheleſſe we referr'd the deliberation of all things till wee
ſaw <hi>Paſithea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day hee returned to ſee her, and after a thouſand expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of kindneſſe, hee imparted to her the newes hee had received from
his deareſt friends who ſtood in need of his ſuccours, and told her, that
if ſhee pleaſed, they would goe away together into <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> which
was a very fit place for their retreat. Shee conſented to all hee had
a minde to; and becauſe ſhee was the day after to be ſet at liberty,
they adviſed to ſend mee to you before, to tell you that within two
dayes after they hoped to arrive here, for being both of them at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
they might feine to goe a walking together out of the Towne,
and ſo goe aboard the Ships that were kept ready for their depart.</p>
                  <p>I was impatient untill I ſaw you, to bring this newes to you, in ſuch
ſort as I tooke my leave of them inſtantly, and came to embarque mee
with him you had ſent, who made me an account of all that happened
to you, ſince I left you, and how for feare of being diſcovered, you made
your ſelfe be call'd <hi>Alcydamas,</hi> and <hi>Palamede, Polydore:</hi> he ſhewed mee a
place where wee might land in the Countrey without being ſeene of
the <hi>Scythians;</hi> and you ſee I am here arriv'd without danger. I ſent him
backe in the ſame Veſſell, to the end hee might direct <hi>Eurymedon</hi> that
way, when hee came. I make no doubt but they will very ſoone be here,
becauſe there is no miſtruſt at all of the diſguiz'd <hi>Hermione;</hi> and <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
is ſo blinded with her love, as he permits her whatſoever ſhee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
ſo as it will be very eaſie for them to make their eſcape, and I hope
when they are once arriv'd with their forces, we ſhall have meanes to
hinder the <hi>Scythians</hi> from carrying away <hi>Ariana,</hi> if they ſtay but here ſo
long, and finde ſome occaſion or other to take her out of their hands ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:7768:153"/>
by ſubtilty or open force.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amyntas</hi> thus ended his diſcourſe, which would have beene regarded
with a great deale of more pleaſure in another ſeaſon; nevertheleſſe it
gave ſome remiſſion to the paines they endur'd for the loſſe of <hi>Ariana.</hi>
But when he had ended, they could ſcarce declare their opinion upon
what they had heard, ſo afflicted were they; and every one return'd to his
complaints as before.</p>

and the faire <hi>Paſithea, Alcydamas</hi> was in great paine to give
him attention, being ſo cruelly diverted with his misfortune
which entirely poſſeſt his minde, that he divers times made him
begin his narration againe, to the end he might be perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the iſſue, becauſe his thoughts were ſtill wandring after <hi>Ariana.</hi>
But when he had made an end, he drew him aſide, and deſired him to goe
with him to the Caſtle to ſpeake with <hi>Arimine. Polydore</hi> was adviſed to keep
his bed by reaſon of his wounds, ſo that it was eaſie for <hi>Alcydamas</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
his purpoſes from him in the preſent buſineſſe: and having acquainted
<hi>Amyntas</hi> with his deſigne, he carried him to <hi>Arimin,</hi> whom he informed that
he was a friend of his addreſſed to him in private from <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> (of whom
he had told him at the beginning of the ſiege) to let him know that he had
ſent him by ſea three thouſand men, who were at Anchor in a road ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
removed from that where the <hi>Scythians</hi> Fleet rode, and which ſhould
that night come into the Towne by ſeverall ports, to the end their marching
in one body might not cauſe them to be diſcovered by the Barbarians. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
was well pleaſed to heare of this ſupply, and <hi>Alcydamas</hi> intreated him
to give order to all the Commanders and guards at the Ports to doe what he
ſhould require of them. Preſently <hi>Arimin</hi> ſent directions all about, that
for that night they ſhould obey all the commands of <hi>Alcydamas;</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a while <hi>Alcydamas</hi> left him to goe and put in frame that which he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Onely <hi>Amyntas</hi> and <hi>Arcas</hi> were of his privy counſell, with whom when
night was come on, he went and drew fifty horſe out of every troop of the
<hi>Theſſalians,</hi> which none of the Captaines refuſed to give way to, perſwading
themſelves that he had order for it. In this ſort he made up a ſquadron of
about five hundred men: then he tooke thirty Trumpets; and having drawn
them all out of the Towne without any noyſe, he told his company he had
promis'd <hi>Arimin</hi> to give a defeat to the whole <hi>Scythian</hi> Campe that night,
and could not endure to ſee them depart, carrying away ſo many perſons as
they had taken in <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> without endevouring to recover them out of their
hands againe: that he had choſen out all of them, being perſwaded they
<pb facs="tcp:7768:154"/>
had courage enough to goe charge the Barbarians in their very Camp, when
they ſhould be oppreſs'd with wine and ſleepe; and that a few men falling
upon them on the ſudden, would doe more good, than if there were a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the plot; that they would therefore expreſſe their willingneſſe to
him, if they had a deſire to follow him, and gaine as great honour as men of
warre were able to attaine. Theſe Gentlemen of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> ſo lov'd the valiant
<hi>Alcydamas,</hi> and were ſo confident in his direction, that they all cryed out to
him, to lead them on. Then he ſignified to them, how this enterpriſe had
beene conceiv'd by him in particular, to ſave certaine Ladies that were
taken priſoners by the <hi>Scythians,</hi> ſo as entring their tents they were to ſpare
this ſex, and to take them out of their hands onely; and becauſe the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
of them was called <hi>Ariana,</hi> he gave them this cry to terrifie the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians
at their firſt aſſailing them all at once, and prayed them to cry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ceaſing, <hi>Ariana, Ariana,</hi> where are you, when they ſhould once be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the fight with them. It being thus ordered, he went himſelfe, and
placed twenty of his Trumpets two by two round about the <hi>Scythians</hi>
Campe, with command to ſound when he began the charge on his ſide. He
reſerved the other ten to goe in the head of his five hundred men, when he
ſhould enter with them into the Campe. After hee had well encouraged
them once againe, he made but one whole troop of them, marching very
cloſe together; and at the entry of the Camp, he bade his Trumpets ſound;
the others anſwered at the inſtant from all ſides, giving a fearefull allarme,
and ſuddenly he began to enter the tents every where, and to make a ſtrange
butchery of the affrighted <hi>Scythians,</hi> who thought all the Devils of hell
were met together to their confuſion. <hi>Melintus</hi> and his companions had no
other trouble but to kill every where as they went, crying out inceſſantly,
<hi>Ariana, Ariana,</hi> and all places ecchoed with that faire name. <hi>Melintus</hi> ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the very ſecretteſt corners of all, cried ſtill, <hi>Ariana,</hi> my deare <hi>Ariana</hi>
where are you? <hi>Ariana,</hi> 'tis <hi>Alcydamas</hi> that ſeekes you: faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> where
are you? In the meane time he ſlew as many <hi>Scythians</hi> as appeared before
him; and he engaged himſelfe ſo farre in this ſearch, that he encountred a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of <hi>Scythians</hi> that were gathered together, having then none but <hi>Amyntas</hi>
and <hi>Arcas</hi> on each ſide of him. His courage ſuffer'd him not to retire; but
contrariwiſe he ſpurr'd his horſe into the very middeſt of them, and ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them in an inſtant. His valour the more provoked by his love, made him
give blowes that were prodigious, imagining to himſelfe, that every <hi>Scythian</hi>
he ſtrucke, was he that had ſtollen away <hi>Ariana.</hi> Preſently he ſlew or put to
flight this number that had rallied together, and afterwards there was not a
man that made any more reſiſtance. He clave heads, he ſtrucke off ſhoulders,
and his enemies cried out, that it was <hi>Mars</hi> himſelfe that came to deſtroy
them. <hi>Amyntas</hi> and <hi>Arcas</hi> killed in like manner as many as they found, and the
reſt of the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> admiring the dreadfull fray of theſe Barbarians, ceaſed
not to put them to the edge of the ſword; in ſuch ſort as all the Camp over
the dead bodies were heaped one upon another; and in the meane time none
of them left off crying, <hi>Ariana, Ariana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Alcydamas</hi> had viſited all the tents, the day now beginning to breake,
he came at laſt out of the Camp, ſeeing no more enemy appeare, and himſelfe
not able to finde what he ſought for. He left his men to purſue what remain'd
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7768:155"/>
of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who gained their ſhipping as well as they could; and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with killing, ſearching, and crying out, finding himſelfe out of breath
too, and all in a ſweat, he was conſtrain'd to alight from his horſe, and laid
him downe at the foot of a tree. And is this the fruit, ſayes he then to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
I muſt reape of all my travels? There remaines not a man in <hi>Theſſaly</hi>
of ſo many Barbarians which invaded it. Have I exterminated them all, and
yet have not <hi>Ariana?</hi> Ah unprofitable valour! that ſuffer'ſt this barbarous
people to triumph over mee in their very defeat; that wert not able by the
death of ſo many men to redeeme the life of <hi>Ariana</hi> alone. Miſerable love,
what ſhall I doe? Shall I unworthily ſurvive my diſaſter; or can there be any
hope left me by ſome means yet untried? Unjuſt gods, why doe ye not render
me her? Have not ye your ſelves raviſh'd her from me? A god could aſſume
no other ſhape but a <hi>Scythians,</hi> for ſo barbarous an action. Alas, if a god now
poſſeſſes her, what rage of jealouſie; but if a <hi>Scythian</hi> has ſtollen her, what hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of ſhame and infamy muſt I endure?</p>
               <p>When the miſerable <hi>Alcydamas</hi> was imployed in theſe wofull complaints,
he ſaw paſſing before him a <hi>Scythian</hi> that fled, and a maid running after and
purſuing him with bow and arrowes. <hi>Alcydamas</hi> was afraid the <hi>Scythian</hi> might
not turne backe and doe her ſome diſpleaſure; ſo as he aroſe up, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after her, cryed out; Stay faire Maid, you are too valorous: doe you not
feare the Barbarian? This Maid heard a voyce ſpeaking to her, and returning
backe againe, let <hi>Alcydamas</hi> come neare her, whom ſhe preſently knew, and
ſaid to him: Ha! my deare <hi>Alcydamas,</hi> is it you indeed? <hi>Alcydamas</hi> as ſoone
knew the voyce and face of <hi>Ariana,</hi> and opening his armes for exceſſe of joy,
held her a long time embraced. They continued thus ſome while without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and unable to ſpeake; at laſt quitting embracements to looke upon one
another, and admire their good fortune for being ſo happily met; Alas! ſaid
<hi>Alcydamas,</hi> is it indeed you I could never finde when I ſought you in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but now doe I finde you when I ſought you not? They were both of
them ſo weakned with travell, and ſeizure of joy, as they were forc'd to lye
downe upon the graſſe neare an hedge, and by and by <hi>Arcas</hi> (who was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
from his Maſter) arriv'd the ſame place, and a little after <hi>Amyntas,</hi>
who rejoyced with <hi>Ariana</hi> for the happineſſe of ſeeing her againe. As ſoone
as ſhe could ſpeake at liberty, <hi>Alcydamas</hi> expreſs'd the impatiency he had to
underſtand what her fortune had bin, and how it came to paſſe ſhe heard them
not when they call'd her from all parts.</p>
               <p>To let you know, anſwer'd ſhe, in what fort it happened, I muſt tell you
the accidents befell me ſince I was taken at <hi>Lariſſa.</hi> A <hi>Scythian</hi> that ſtole me
having found an horſe in the Towne, ſet me up and rode away with me;
when he was out of the ports, his purpoſe was to get to a wood, to be the more
remov'd from encountring his companions. Judge you in what affright I was,
and how many ſhrieks and plaints I utter'd all in vaine; but when he ſtayed
to alight off a horſebacke with me, he felt himſelfe ſtrucke with an arrow.
Preſently he turn'd him, and ſaw another <hi>Scythian</hi> that had followed him on
foot, whoſe deſigne being to have me; becauſe he could not ſo ſoone over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
him, he thought to have ſtayed him by this blow ſhot from a farre off.
The firſt that had bin ſtrucke drawing a ſhaft out of his quiver put it haſtily to
his bow, and with it wounded the other alſo that was comming to him.
<pb facs="tcp:7768:155"/>
Then they both threw away their bowes and arrowes, and tooke their ſwords
in hand to fight it out, and ſee whoſe of the two I ſhould remine. I was ſo
forlorne that I knew not what reſolution to take, ſeeing what accident ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hapned I was to remaine with one of them. I labour'd to get upon the
horſe that ſtood neare me, to flye away while they fought; but I was never
able to compaſſe it; ſo I was forc'd to attend the ſucceſſe of this duell. They
gave one another furious blowes, being both animated with the deſire of
having me: but the firſt of them being inflam'd beſides with anger, and a
longing to revenge himſelfe upon the other, ſeem'd to me the moſt valiant:
ſo he ſtruck downe at his feet him that had aſſaulted him, and lying upon him
did his beſt to take away his life, the other being unable to defend himſelfe
but by ſtrugling. Already had the firſt man ſtruck him twice with his ſword
into the throat, and I ſaw that he had even now won me, when a Serpent
gliding forth of a buſh there hard by, came and bit the legge of him that
was uppermoſt, then went and put her ſelfe into the buſh againe. I thought
it preſently an advice ſent me from the gods, that if I could defeat him that
remain'd, I might ſave my ſelfe. I tooke courage then, and beleeving I was
aſſiſted by ſome divine inſpiration, tooke up one of their bowes, and putting
an arrow upon it, came neare them, and bending the bow with all the force
I had, I let flye the arrow, and pierced the body of him that had gotten the
victory, as the other <hi>Scythian,</hi> in dying, held him ſtill embraced. I was not
content with this, but ſeeing he could not yet get looſe of him he killed, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
my blow ſo happily with another arrow, that I pierced him to the
very heart, and at the ſame time they both of them expired. I was well
pleas'd to ſee my ſelfe thus delivered: but when I thought to depart, looking
up I ſaw foure or five other <hi>Scythians</hi> approaching to me. Theſe had bin
witneſſes of my action, and (peradventure my face after ſo much motion ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſome extraordinary colour,) beleev'd there was ſomething divine in me,
for having kill'd, as they thought, two men at one blow. So they had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to me, thinking I was ſome goddeſſe tutelary of <hi>Greece,</hi> that tooke
vengeance of them for the ſpoyle they had made in <hi>Theſſaly.</hi> But yet one of
them bolder than the reſt, came neare, and would have touch'd me, I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
me inſtantly behinde the buſh where I had ſeene the Serpent retire, and
putting an arrow to my bow, ſhot it into the buſh to make the Serpent come
forth, which preſently glided out upon them. Then they made no doubt at
all but I was a goddeſſe, thinking the arrow I had ſhot had bin chang'd into a
Serpent to devoure them. They caſt themſelves at my feet to adore me, and
expreſt to me in their language, which I underſtood not, how they deſir'd I
ſhould pardon them, and keepe the Serpent from hurting them. It happened
by chance that the Serpent went away from them at the ſame time, to hide
her ſelfe in the hedges: they ſignified by their actions, how much beholding
to me they were: But when I would make uſe of this opinion I had produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in them of my being a goddeſſe, to get away from them I found it no ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
buſineſſe; for they came round about me upon their knees, and prayed
me not to forſake them. On the other ſide, I was rather willing to ſtay with
them that were poſſeſt with this errour, than fall into the hands of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who might not be ſo miſtaken as they were. So I was reſolv'd, becauſe
I could doe no other, to goe along with them, and ſerve my ſelfe of their
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:7768:156"/>
company for my defence againſt others. I went in a ſtately pace, and one
while I threatned them with my bow, another while I look'd with a more
pleaſing face upon them, to give them hope of my aſſiſtance. At laſt they
brought me into a tent, and preſently made it be noyſed among the <hi>Scythians,</hi>
that they had found the goddeſſe tutelary of <hi>Greece:</hi> becauſe I ſaw many of
them come and open the tent borders, and to looke upon me in great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
I was much troubled how to demeane my ſelfe, that they might not
be diſabuſed; and fearing that having knowne me for one that had abus'd
them, they would make me ſuffer many indignities, I reſolv'd with my ſelfe,
ſince I could not eſcape from them, to dye by hunger; and this reſolution
ſerv'd to confirme their opinion the more; for ſtill refuſing them when they
offered me any thing to eat, they beleev'd I had no need of the ordinary
ſuſtenance of mans life, and I was in hope to dye in this faſhion, when they
never perceived any thing. So I paſſed away the night, and yeſterday too,
without taking any nouriſhment: but in the evening ſeeing how they drank
more than ordinary, I had ſome hope to ſave my ſelfe. I provok'd them my
ſelfe to drinke and be merry; and in the end they were ſo drunke, that of
ſeven or eight that were in the tent, there were but two of them yet awake,
though their eyes ſhewed they would ſoone be laid upon the ground with
their fellowes. Then I ſtill offer'd them wine, which they receiv'd with
reſpect, being very proud, I beleeve, to have a goddeſſe their Cup-bearer;
and a while after they fell backward as well as the reſt. So was I left alone in
that tent with open eyes, and I reſolv'd to ſave my ſelfe: but being as much
preſſed with hunger, as deſire to be gone, I confeſſe I tooke ſome peeces of
bread and meat before I went out, and as I made my eſcape, I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine
from putting to my mouth inſtantly what proviſion I had. But I was no
ſooner twenty paces out of the Camp, but I heard Trumpets ſounding on
all ſides. I was affrighted at them, and knew not if I ſhould goe forward,
or elſe returne into the Campe: but chooſing all ſorts of ill adventures, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to come among the Barbarians againe, I went onward, and found
a cave whereinto I had the aſſurance to enter, having the bow in my hand,
and the quiver on my ſhoulders, with an arrow in readineſſe to defend me,
either againſt men or beaſts. I kept cloſe a while within this place; but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſo much noyſe, I was curious to ſee what the matter was, and went up to
the top of the cave, from whence I perceiv'd all the <hi>Scythians</hi> running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and ſo terrible a fray amongſt them, as they thought themſelves pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
by thoſe very men that fled. I rejoyc'd at their defeat, with a conceit I
had that <hi>Alcydamas</hi> was chiefe in ſo bold an enterprize. I ſpent above three
houres in conſidering that ſight which was not unpleaſing to me, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to wonder that all the field over there appear'd not a <hi>Scythian</hi> any more,
for now the day began to breake. I was lifting up my hands to heaven for
ſo great a victory acquired by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> when I heard a noyſe, and perceiv'd
two Barbarians that ſought where to ſave themſelves. I was afraid they would
have ſeene me and done me ſome miſchiefe, ſo as I entred the cave againe,
and a little while after perceived them comming into the ſame place with an
intention to hide themſelves there. Then being unable to avoyd their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me, if they came any further, I reſolved, becauſe I ſaw them, and they
were not aware of me, to ſhoot my arrowes, and drive them away by ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:7768:156"/>
a terror into them. The firſt ſtrucke one of them into the throat, and
laid him dead upon the earth: the other <hi>Scythian</hi> hearing it whizze, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
ſome enemies were hidden there within, began to flye. His cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe
made me courageous, and I felt my ſelfe carried away with a certaine
ardour of glory, to have the honour of killing the laſt <hi>Scythian.</hi> So I ſet
my ſelfe to purſue him with ſhot of arrowes, and in the chace I was ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
as to incounter you. And this, my deare <hi>Alcydamas,</hi> continued <hi>Ariana,</hi>
hath beene my fortune ſince I loſt you, whereby you could neither finde
me, nor I heare you when you called me in the Campe, and I doubt not but
you have had feare enough for my ſake, and that your enterpriſe was attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
onely for my deliverance. Then they embrac'd againe; and <hi>Amyntas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to the faire <hi>Ariana</hi> what he had heard of the two victories of <hi>Alcyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
in the day of the battell; the death of the King of the <hi>Scythians</hi> by his
hand, his regrets afterwards for having loſt her, and the ſtrange reſolution
he tooke with five hundred men to fight with the reſt of the Barbarians
Army, that he might deliver her before they departed. When they recited
their adventures together, the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> that were ſcattered on all ſides, ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
in that place, when they knew their Captaine to be there, and they told
him there was not a <hi>Scythian</hi> left alive in all the coaſt, and that the few that
remain'd had fled, &amp; gained the plaine Sea in their ſhipping. Theſe Gentlemen
were ſo well pleaſed at this glorious victory, that they could not containe
their joy, for never did ſo few men defeat ſo great a number; and <hi>Alcyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
having ſeene ſome of them too buſie in pillaging, prayed them to leave
the booty, becauſe they were rich enough in honour: but to make it appeare
at their returne into the Towne, how great a defeat was given, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men they alone had ſlaine, that they would load themſelves with as many
bows as each of them could beare, to aſtoniſh <hi>Arimin</hi> &amp; the people with theſe
very ſpoyles in their entry. Every one agreed to his deſire, and <hi>Ariana</hi> being
ſet upon <hi>Arcas</hi> horſe, who went by her ſide, <hi>Alcydamas</hi> gave order they ſhould
all march three by three, bearing the bundles of bowes upon their ſhoulders,
and he put himſelfe into a ranke in the middeſt, and went beſide the faire
<hi>Ariana,</hi> who triumphed alſo over the <hi>Scythians,</hi> with bow in her hand, and
quiver in a skarfe. <hi>Alcydamas</hi> was raviſhed for having found her, and to ſee
her now in this habit of a ſouldier, which added a majeſtuous fierceneſſe to ſo
many graces ſhe had before, and augmented the affection of <hi>Alcydamas;</hi> his
valour even falling in love with <hi>Ariana's;</hi> and in this equipage they marched
all towards the Towne.</p>
               <p>In the meane time they were in a great fight within <hi>Lariſſa;</hi> for <hi>Arimin</hi>
having ſent to know about midnight if the ſupply were entred; word was
brought him, that not a man appear'd; but contrarily that <hi>Alcydamas</hi> was
gone out with certaine troops he had drawne out of all the companies. This
amaz'd him, not being able to imagine what <hi>Alcydamas</hi> project was, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
let ſome houres more paſſe without receiving any meſſage from <hi>Alcyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas;</hi>
they inform'd him at length, that without doubt he was gone to ſave
a Maid he loved, whom the <hi>Scythians</hi> ſtole away when they were in the
Towne; becauſe he had done nothing all day but mourne for her, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſearch'd all places. <hi>Arimin</hi> could not then perſwade himſelfe, that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydamas</hi>
with ſo few men hoped to make his party good againſt all the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:7768:157"/>
but he beleev'd that to redeeme his Miſtreſſe he would deliver to the
Barbarians the beſt of his men he brought them for that purpoſe, wherewith
the Towne being weakned, he might eaſily alſo bring the <hi>Scythian</hi> in, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them ſtill more to render him that Maid. He ſent in all haſte for <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>
who was in bed; but when he was up and gone to him, <hi>Arimin</hi> told him
that <hi>Alcydamas</hi> was a traytor and a villaine, and that he ſhould anſwer for
him. <hi>Polydore,</hi> after he was made acquainted with what had hapned, aſſured
<hi>Arimin</hi> that <hi>Alcydamas</hi> was no traytor; that peradventure he might have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
ſomething out of deſpaire, becauſe the <hi>Scythians</hi> carried away <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana:</hi>
but he was very certaine he would not loſe thoſe he tooke with him,
much leſſe ſell them: whereof he gave him his owne life for caution. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
cauſed <hi>Polydore</hi> to be ſurely guarded, and not fully ſatisfied for what he
had told him, went to viſit all the Towne-guards; and the people were left
in great feare, not having above three or foure thouſand men remaining to
make reſiſtance againſt ſo many enemies.</p>
               <p>The Ports were therefore guarded with extraordinary care, when <hi>Alcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas</hi>
with his troop demanded entrance. They went to advertiſe <hi>Arimin</hi>
that he was at the gates with thoſe that went out with him, and requir'd to
be let in. This newes reſtor'd the ſpirits of <hi>Arimin,</hi> who for all that fearing
a ſurpriſe, commanded they ſhould not ſuffer them to enter but one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
And this order ſerv'd to make more glory and praiſe be given <hi>Alcyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas;</hi>
for his ſouldiers entring thus ſeparately charged with bowes, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
gave acclamations to each of them as he came in; and when they were
all within the Towne, they put themſelves into the ſame order they march'd
in before, and went to the Temple to thanke the gods for ſo renowned a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.
All the inhabitants for joy lift up their hands to heaven, to ſee ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſpoyles, and ſo few perſons to beare them away; and they were in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to behold by <hi>Alcydamas</hi> ſide that young Warrioreſſe, who ſeemed to
have a great ſhare in this victory, and to attract the eyes and vowes of all the
world.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Alcydamas</hi> had thanked the gods for the ſafety of <hi>Ariana,</hi> and the
victory they had given him, he prayed <hi>Amyntas</hi> to conduct <hi>Ariana</hi> to their
lodging, and gave <hi>Arcas</hi> charge to accompany them; but he with the reſt
of his troop went to finde <hi>Arimin.</hi> He beſought him to excuſe the tranſport
of his affection which had obliged him to abuſe him, and goe forth without
his leave to deliver <hi>Ariana</hi> out of the <hi>Scythians</hi> hands; and told him how the
victory he had gained was ſo great, that when he knew the truth of it, hee
hoped he would eaſily forget a fault that had beene followed by ſo happy a
ſucceſſe, and freed all <hi>Greece</hi> of ſo many enemies. <hi>Arimin</hi> in admiration of ſo
wonderfull an effect, though it had coſt him many a feare, was conſtrain'd to
honour <hi>Alcydamas,</hi> and ſmother all reſentment he might have at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience:
and when they had a long time diſcourſed after what manner
the combat paſſed, he ſuffered him to retire to his reſt, and gave <hi>Polydore</hi> his
enlargement.</p>
               <p>When they were come to their lodging, <hi>Alcydamas</hi> was conſtrain'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
him to his bed, and repoſe himſelfe after ſo many combats, cares and
watchings; <hi>Ariana</hi> on the other ſide was receiv'd with a thouſand joyes by
<hi>Euphroſyne</hi> and her deare <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> who had taken no reſt ſince her carrying
<pb facs="tcp:7768:157"/>
away, as well for the regret of her loſſe, as the danger her belov'd <hi>Lepantus</hi>
was in, becauſe of his wounds, which now began to be in better eſtate. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroſyne</hi>
full of contentment to ſee them againe, ceaſed not to take care one
while of her ſonne, another while of <hi>Ariana,</hi> and viſiting them ſeverally
at their Chambers, ſhe obliged them to ſleepe, though it were then but
mid-day.</p>
               <p>A little while after <hi>Polydore</hi> and <hi>Amyntas</hi> hearing a rumour in the ſtreet,
look'd out at the window, and ſpied a diſtreſſed Maid that certaine ſouldiers
would have taken, againſt whom an old man and a youth defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with more courage than force. They preſently went downe to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that un worthy violence, and labour'd by words to make thoſe ſouldiers
retire; then ſeeing they would doe nothing by entreaty, but continued to
preſſe the old man and the youth, they were forced to take their parts, and
defend them: two other ſouldiers ſeeing this ſupply, joyned them to the
firſt: but in a ſhort time <hi>Polydore</hi> and <hi>Amyntas</hi> killed three of them, and the
reſt tooke their heeles. Then they deſir'd to ſee ſafely beſtowed thoſe that
had thus beene purſued, and going towards the young man, that ſo coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly
had defended himſelfe, <hi>Polydore</hi> was advis'd that it was his deare <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charis.</hi>
He embrac'd her in his armes, full of joy to ſee her againe, and for having
ſecur'd her from that danger. <hi>Amyntas</hi> had as much cauſe to rejoyce alſo, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhe that <hi>Epicharis</hi> defended was the faire <hi>Erycina</hi> his Miſtreſſe; and the
old man was <hi>Telephus Erycina's</hi> father. Embracements followed their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for ſo happily encountring one another, ſome to be defended, others to
have ſuccoured them; and all of them having great impatiency to know
how they were met together, entred into the houſe, where <hi>Polydore</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her he had ſo much regretted: Faire and valiant <hi>Epicharis,</hi> ſayes hee to
her, for the happineſſe you give me in ſeeing you againe, I will give you
newes that will be very welcome to you: but promiſe me before hand that it
ſhall be happy for me too. <hi>Epicharis</hi> ſaid to him; You know I am ſo many
wayes oblig'd to you, that you ought to be aſſured of your being happy,
when your happineſſe ſhall depend of none but me. I know, replies he, of
what parents you are borne. Ah <hi>Palamede,</hi> ſayes ſhe full of joy, is it poſſible?
of whom might you learne this? I know it, replies he, and demand of you
what man of the world you had rather have for your brother. I would have,
anſwers ſhe without much ſtudy, ſuch an one as <hi>Melintus,</hi> whom I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
loved after that ſort, although I could never hope for ſo great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Ah! worthy ſiſter of ſuch a brother, anſwered <hi>Palamede,</hi> Remember,
<hi>Epicharis,</hi> that this day I give him you for your brother; and ſince you could
not expect a greater happineſſe, grant me alſo the greateſt I am able to hope
for, which is the honour of poſſeſſing you. <hi>Palamede,</hi> ſayes <hi>Epicharis,</hi> mocke
me not, though I have a great courage in me, I have not yet ſo much am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.
No, purſues he, aſſure your ſelfe I ſpeake truth, and that you are <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
ſiſter, and daughter to the ſage <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> whom we have found in your
abſence, and ſhe is now here with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epicharis</hi> ſtood ſilent, and durſt neither contradict <hi>Palamede</hi> at that time, nor
yet beleeve him: but he ſeeing how ſhe could not be aſſur'd at his words,
brought her where <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> was, to whom he ſaid, he preſented her <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charis,</hi>
that daughter of hers ſhe had heard ſuch wonders of. <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> ſeeing
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:7768:158"/>
her to be dreſt in a boy; What, ſayes ſhe, is this young man my daughter?
Yes, anſwered he, ſee the generous <hi>Epicharis,</hi> who under this habit has done
braver actions than the valianteſt man alive could have done; and whom
the gods without doubt had made of my ſex, but that they had a deſigne to
make me happy. <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> was thus oblig'd to beleeve him, and opened
her armes to receive her. <hi>Epicharis,</hi> although full of joy, was amaz'd for all
that, not able yet to be confident of that good fortune, and aſham'd to ſee
her ſelfe in this eſtate, before a mother that had ſo grave a faſhion. <hi>Alcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas</hi>
and <hi>Ariana</hi> awaked at the noyſe of ſo many gratulations, and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiz'd
that <hi>Epicharis</hi> was found, they came running halfe dreſt as they were
to ſee her, ſo great deſire had they to give her the firſt embrace of brother
and ſiſter. They found her in <hi>Euphroſynes</hi> armes, and then they oppreſs'd
her with ſo many careſſes that ſhe was even confounded withall. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide <hi>Telephus</hi> embrac'd now <hi>Melintus,</hi> now <hi>Euphroſyne. Erycine</hi> likewiſe
requir'd her turne to embrace <hi>Ariana,</hi> and could not give <hi>Amyntas</hi> the time
he deſir'd for her entertainment: nevertheleſſe ſhe acknowledged the great
obligation ſhe had to him for her deliverance. They had at one time ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
perſons to make much of, and ſo many joyes to reſent, as they knew not
either how to ſpeake to thoſe they deſir'd to ſee, or how to quit thoſe they
had addreſt to, that they might ſee the others. They ſpent above two houres
in diſpatching all thoſe acknowledgements; and at laſt every one having mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated
his admiration and joyes, they were deſirous to know by what means
they had encountred in that place. But becauſe at the ſame time different
queſtions were propounded to all of them concerning their adventures, it
was thought fitteſt to know their ſeverall fortunes, that one ſhould ſpeake on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and <hi>Epicharis</hi> being choſen to relate what ſhe had done, ſince ſhe loſt her
ſelfe at <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> ſhe demanded ſilence, and when every one was ſet, began
to ſpeake in this manner:</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Hiſtory of Epicharis.</head>
                  <p>WHen I ſhall have acquainted you with all the fortunes I have run my
ſelfe ſince I was ſeparate from you, and with all thoſe too I have
caus'd that eſtate run which upon earth is confeſt higheſt and the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted,
you will admire certainly, that a Maid in ſo ſhort a ſpace could be
capable to remove ſo puiſſant obſtacles, and enterpriſe to revenge the world
of the tyrant that oppreſſes it, by giving another head to the Empire: but
certaine it is that there is no power ſafe, if there be found a perſon that will
abandon his owne life.</p>
                  <p>After I had eſcap'd <hi>Trebatius</hi> priſons, by the hardy enterpriſe of <hi>Palamede,</hi>
I attended him ſome while at the place we agreed to meet in: but ſeeing that
he came not, I beleev'd he had loſt his way by reaſon of the darkneſſe, and
after having throwne away the caſque and coat-armour of the dead ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
I had taken to goe out in, and which I wore in paine for the weight of
them, I went ſtreight to the lodging where we lay together, but there I
found you not, nor could heare any newes of you. From thence I went to
the haven not knowing what ſhould become of me, and beleeving you had
ſaved your ſelves by ſome meanes or other, I reſolv'd alſo to returne no more
<pb facs="tcp:7768:158"/>
to the City, for feare of falling againe into the hands of <hi>Trebatius</hi> and <hi>Dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus.</hi>
By good fortune I found a little Veſſell that was ready to ſet ſaile,
whereinto I went aboard, never enquiring for what place it was bound, for I
thought of nothing then but flying from our enemies. I cannot tell you for
what occaſion this ſhip came into <hi>Epire,</hi> becauſe I had very little converſation
with thoſe that were in her, for not diſcovering my ſelfe: but they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to joyne with the Fleet of the Emperours Gallies which ordinarily rides
by the promontory of <hi>Miſena</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> It was neare upon two dayes that I
had not ſlept, ſo as when we were arriv'd, I was conſtrain'd to ſtay in the ſhip
ſtill, for ſleepe aſſailed me with too much violence to be reſiſted, and I laid
me downe in a place out of the way.</p>
                  <p>I had not quitted my habit of a man ſince I was taken, and ſome indiſcreet
fellow finding me, as I was faſt aſleepe, was very earneſt in conſidering mee,
and ſeeing a ſwelling in my clothes about the boſome, uncovered my necke
when I never felt him. After he knew what I was, he went to advertiſe his
companions, who ſhewed themſelves as inſolent as he, and preſently they
waked me without any reſpect, to carry me to him that commanded them.
I was in a great wonder at my awaking to ſee my ſelfe in theſe mens hands,
with my boſome open; I demanded of them what they would doe with me,
and they ſaid, they would know for what deſigne I ſo diſguiz'd my ſelfe. So
I came before their Captaine, whoſe name was <hi>Proculus,</hi> and I was more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
at their inſolent uncovering of my boſome to let him ſee what I was,
than afraid of being puniſhed. I was ſo fortunate that <hi>Proculus</hi> was moved
with compaſſion, and forbade thoſe men to wrong me: then making as if
he would examine me apart, he commanded them to be gone. When they
were out of his gally, he led me into a Chamber, and ask'd me for what cauſe
I went in that habit.</p>
                  <p>I doe not know what it was that pleas'd him in me, but he ſhewed a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to me that was too ſuddenly bred to be founded upon any good deſigne:
therefore to take from him the hope he ſeem'd to conceive, of obtaining
ſomething of me againſt my honour, I reſolv'd to expreſſe a great courage,
and I ſpake thus to him: I well know, this diſguiſement is held a crime, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there have beene of my ſex that under this habit have conceal'd their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
and made uſe thereof, to continue with more liberty the actions that
were unworthy of them: but it ought to be eſteem'd commendable when
one ſerves her ſelfe of it for an effect quite contrary, as I that have beene
conſtrain'd to take it for the conſervation of my honour, and eſcaping the
hands of thoſe that would have ſpoiled me of it; and if this meane had fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
me, I was reſolved to loſe my life rather. This diſcourſe hindred him
from making appeare to me then any unlawfull deſire, and he onely intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me to tell him who they were that would have offered me diſpleaſure. I
could not in a moment invent a continuation of falſities, with many names
and circumſtances, ſo as having nothing more preſent in my minde than
<hi>Trebatius,</hi> and the reſentment of the injuries I had received, I told him, how
being at <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> I fell by misfortune into the hands of <hi>Trebatius,</hi> Tribune
of the Emperours guards, who from <hi>Nero</hi> ſought to put to death certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
with whom I was: that <hi>Trebatius</hi> after he had a long time kept mee in
irons, had threatned me with death, if I declar'd not to him where they
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:7768:159"/>
were he ſought; but in the end ſeeing ſo great reſolution in me, he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
his rage into a diſhoneſt affection, which I now feared more than the
purpoſe he had before to have me dye; and having found meanes to eſcape
his hands by this diſguiſe, I had beene in no place ſince where I could accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
my ſelfe with other clothes. <hi>Proculus</hi> willing to oblige me, and being
himſelfe not ſatisfied with <hi>Nero,</hi> ſayes to me; O gods! how long will this
Tyrant finde executioners for all his maſſacres? See how he is forc'd to ſerve
himſelfe of wicked men to exterminate all the world. Offices are now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of crimes, and none is advanc'd to honour, but according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the villanies he hath committed, or of thoſe he is capable to commit.
A few dayes ſince we had for Generall of theſe Gallies one <hi>Anicetus,</hi> who
never had come to this charge, but for killing the mother of <hi>Nero.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
Emperour willing afterwards to rid himſelfe of his wife <hi>Octavia</hi> that
was of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> race, to marry <hi>Sabina,</hi> drew that murtherer from hence, for
to goe before the Senate, and name himſelfe falſly the adulterer of the chaſte
Princeſſe. And during the reigne of ſo abominable a monſter, can it be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
that vertuous men ſhould attaine any honour? I have a long time ſerv'd
in the charge I have here over ſome veſſels, and was never yet able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
any favour for my ſervices, but that they ſtill ſuffer me to ſerve. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
your ſelfe, faire Maid, goes he on, you reſent not alone the cruelties of
this tyranny; and be aſſur'd that if you have ſuffered ſome torment, there be
an infinite number of perſons that groane, and expect but a man that has the
courage to take upon him to be their Chiefe, and deliver the world of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
miſeries.</p>
                  <p>I was very well pleas'd, proceeds <hi>Epicharis,</hi> to heare him ſpeake after that
faſhion: for I had no leſſe reſentment than he againſt <hi>Nero,</hi> for the rage hee
expreſs'd againſt <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede;</hi> and conſidering with my ſelfe how
they would never be in ſafety as long as ſo wicked an Emperour lived; I
would encourage him further, to cauſe him to attempt ſomething, and deliver
us of ſo puiſſant an enemy. I told him, that if there wanted but a perſon to
awaken the reſt, I offer'd my ſelfe to goe into <hi>Rome,</hi> and make a powerfull
conſpiracy againſt <hi>Nero,</hi> and that I would willingly ſacrifice my owne life for
the ſafety of all the world. Courage, ſaid he to mee, generous Maid, begin
but ſo faire a deſigne, and be aſſured I ſhall ſecond you well enough. If the
Emperour comes hither ſhortly, as he oftentimes takes his pleaſure upon the
Sea, I will employ no other man but my ſelfe, for the worlds deliverance:
If you will goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> endevour to draw him hither by the meanes of ſome
you may practiſe for the purpoſe, and then you ſhall ſee, that I can execute
what I have attempted. We had beſides ſome other ſuch like diſcourſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
whereby we emboldned one another in the enterpriſe. I tooke a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to be gone the very next day to <hi>Rome,</hi> that I might draw into our
conjuration the men that were of moſt power there; not doubting but there
were many of them full of courage, who deſir'd nothing ſo much as <hi>Nero's</hi>
death, but durſt not truſt another with ſo hardy a deſigne, and who would
not faile to joyne their forces together, if they might but communicate their
grievances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Proculus,</hi> who at the beginning had not dared to ſignifie the lewd deſire he
had to me, becauſe I had ſpoken with ſuch a boldneſſe to him, thought then,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:7768:159"/>
that binding my ſelfe to him by this confidence in a ſecret of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
he might have ſome greater familiarity with me, and ſaid to me; Faire
Maid, thoſe that deſire to run a hazard together, have ordinarily a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
one to another, whether there be in them a ſympathy that carries them
to like deſignes, or by reaſon of the mutuall aſſiſtance they are to give each
other, to make an enterpriſe ſucceſſefull. I pray you, let us joyne in affection,
to the end that if our project happily takes effect, we may enjoy together
the repoſe we ſhall obtaine for all the world. I anſwer'd him, that I refus'd
not to binde my ſelfe to him in a friendſhip that were neceſſary for thoſe that
had the ſame deſigne; and that I promis'd him all kinds of fidelity and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours.
Adde hereunto, ſaid he, that after we ſhall have executed our deſire,
you will promiſe to live with me, and we ſhall never be ſeparate. I return'd,
that I could not as yet determine of what I was to doe, after delivering the
world of that tyrant, and intreated him to leave me at my liberty untill that
time. Then he expreſs'd much paſſion, and urged me with many words
to ſhew a little more affection towards him than ſo; but I would give him
no other aſſurance: yet I ſpake to him in a faſhion that depriv'd him not of
all hope, for feare of angring him, or making him alter his reſolution.</p>
                  <p>The next day I dreſt me in womans clothes, not willing to goe to <hi>Rome</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
for feare of being knowne in a mans habit by thoſe I had deceived
in the priſon, and to avoyd a ſecond apprehenſion. <hi>Proculus</hi> would have given
me money, but becauſe I had ſtill about me that I tooke to gaine the Porter
of <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> I thanked him, and taking my leave, put my ſelfe in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of ſome that were going to <hi>Rome.</hi> We arriv'd there in a ſmall time, and I
went to lodge at <hi>Maximus</hi> his, who receiv'd me with many teſtimonies of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and told me he had great obligations to <hi>Melintus</hi> for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
he kept of him; and about evening he ſhewed me the rich preſents he
had ſent him, which he ſaid he receiv'd onely to keepe them as deare pledges
of his friendſhip. I beleev'd that he being lov'd of the powerfulleſt of <hi>Rome,</hi>
I might by his meanes enter into their acquaintance; and when we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
I began to tell him how many wayes <hi>Nero</hi> had perſecuted us. At firſt
he onely pittied our caſe, afterwards by little and little I ſo wrought with
him, that he diſcover'd himſelfe, and confeſſed to me, the world would be
much at eaſe to be deliver'd of ſo cruell a Prince. Then I feined not to tell
him my deſigne, and that I ſhould want no courage for an enterpriſe ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to all the earth. He fortified me as well as he could in that reſolution,
and told me he would give me acceſſe to perſons, by whoſe intermiſſion he
beleev'd my deſire might ſucceed: and becauſe at the ſame time it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
to know who ſhould be ſucceſſour to the Empire, he ſaid he knew
none more fit for it than <hi>Piſo,</hi> both for Nobility and all other qualities requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
and how that choyce would be approved of the Senate, of the people,
and of the legions. I told him all the diſcourſe I had with <hi>Proculus,</hi> and that
it ſhould not be laid to his charge, that <hi>Nero</hi> receiv'd not puniſhment due to
his crimes, if he might be drawne towards <hi>Miſena. Maximus</hi> told me, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Nero</hi> went often towards <hi>Baiae</hi> and <hi>Puteoli,</hi> which were in thoſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to delight himſelfe upon the Sea, and many times to <hi>Piſo's</hi> houſe at
<hi>Baiae,</hi> and much opportunity might there be found to kill him: but that
hee knew <hi>Proeulus,</hi> and that hee was not a man to be truſted, for being
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:7768:160"/>
both a great talker, and of a turbulent and volaticke ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>The day after he brought me to the ſpeech of two or three Senators, and of
ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, who received me as if I had beene ſent from heaven,
to aſſemble what remain'd of vertuous and courageous men, and by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
violence to free the world of tyranny. I was well pleas'd to ſee ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
a beginning: but I encountred <hi>Proculus</hi> in the City, who had followed
me, and ſought me all about, being no longer able to live without me, as he
ſaid. After having expreſs'd much joy to ſee me, he ask'd mee if I had done
any thing in the affaire we were plotting together: I was very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
how I ſhould carry my ſelfe to this man, that I might neither diſcontent
him, nor yet give him part in my ſecret for following the advice of <hi>Maximus.</hi>
I reſolv'd in the end to tell him I had quitted the deſigne we had taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that the difficulties had deterr'd me. He would have re-aſſur'd mee
to the purſuit of the enterpriſe; but I told him I would thinke no more of it.
After ſome other diſcourſe, he oblig'd me to tell him where I lodged; and
afterwards he came very often to viſit me at <hi>Maximus</hi> his: but I ever made
him be anſwered that I was not there, to avoyd any further engaging my ſelfe
with him.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time, within three or foure dayes I had drawne to my party
more than twenty perſons of authority: and at laſt they brought me to <hi>Piſo,</hi>
who after many kindneſſes, prayed me to have a good courage, and promis'd
me great rewards when he came to the Empire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Piſo</hi> was a friend to <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Lucan:</hi> for <hi>Seneca</hi> he durſt not ſpeake
of this conſpiracy to him, redoubting his too ſevere wiſdome: but having
gained <hi>Lucan, Seneca's</hi> Nephew, he prayed him to mention it to his uncle for
to ſound him; that if he diſapprov'd the deſigne, he might at leaſt be retain'd
from revealing it by the conſideration of his Nephew.</p>
                  <p>I met by chance at <hi>Lucan's,</hi> when <hi>Seneca</hi> came to ſee him: for I went ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
to his houſe, becauſe <hi>Attila</hi> his mother was of the conjuration, and for
the honour of my ſex I was wel content to be often with her, that I might not
ſeeme a ſole practitioner of men. <hi>Lucan</hi> being deſirous I ſhould make report
unto <hi>Piſo</hi> in what manner he had ſpoken to <hi>Seneca,</hi> ſhut mee up in a Cabinet
where I could heare what they ſaid; and I was ſo extremely delighted at this
incounter, for having an occaſion to heare the diſcourſe of that great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
whoſe vertue and learning were of ſo high a reputation. When they
were alone in the Chamber, they ſpake at firſt of divers indifferent things;
and <hi>Lucan</hi> at length putting him upon the diſcourſe of affaires, and of the life
of <hi>Nero;</hi> Nephew, ſaid he, I can informe you of nothing. Since the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
as you know, would not ſuffer me to retire into the Countrey, I have
found meanes to enjoy ſolitude even in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, and not daring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
my ſelfe from affaires, I have remov'd them from me, not ſuffering them
to approach me any more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucan</hi> anſwered him, Take heed <hi>Nero</hi> imagines not a diſliking you have
to his actions, in that you avoyd to be a witneſſe of them; and if he takes
this opinion once, he that feared not to put his mother, his brother, and his
wife to death, will never be afraid to have his <hi>Preceptor</hi> dye. Ah! my nephew,
replied <hi>Seneca,</hi> doe you beleeve I can be troubled with this feare? to what
end ſerv'd my continuall ſtudy of Philoſophy, if it learn'd me not to dye? I
<pb facs="tcp:7768:160"/>
give not up my ſelfe to wiſdome for acquiring repoſe, but I ſeeke repoſe, to
acquire wiſdome. I had much rather he ſhould make me dye, than oblige me
to participate his crimes. If he takes me out of the world, I ſhall receive
death as a benefit, in ſtead of the retreat I deſired; and he ſhall give me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thinking, the ſame thing he refus'd me. Theſe be ſpeeches, return'd
<hi>Lucan,</hi> worthy of your ſelfe: but ſhould you not expreſſe more vertue yet
to ſuccour the dying Common-wealth, than not to feare dying your ſelfe?
If ſhe reaches out her armes to be ſuſtained by you, when ſhe is ready to fall,
will you refuſe to lend her your hand? and ſhall your Philoſophy warrant
you from the reproaches of having abandon'd her? If this ſuccours, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Seneca,</hi> might be given without the death of him I have brought up, and
who holds the place of a ſonne with me, I call the gods to witneſſe, I would
willingly employ this deſpicable life of mine, for the univerſall ſafety: but
what vertue is there ſo ſevere, to oblige me to kill my Nurſe-childe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor?
and what wiſdome teacheth ingratitude and parricide? Truly I
excuſe in you this affection for the Re-publike. I proteſt if I were not <hi>Seneca</hi>
I ſhould be the firſt man to give <hi>Nero</hi> his death. So many crimes, and ſo much
bloud-ſhed have effac'd that ſacred Majeſty which the gods imprint upon
the front of Princes; and this abominable man affecting the titles of Player
and Harper, hath of himſelfe abandon'd thoſe other of Emperour, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Univerſe. I beleeve there will never be another Prince in the
world beſides this, for whom it may be lawfull to breake the oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
We ought to reverence thoſe we obey, becauſe wee are to beleeve
they are given us from heaven: But that Prince certainly is not given of
the gods, who delights himſelfe in the filthineſſe of the moſt horrid
crimes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucan</hi> having let <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeake ſome time, was very glad that he approv'd
the riddance of a Tyrant; and feined no longer to diſcover to him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy:
nevertheleſſe he found it not ſtrange that he refus'd to lend his hand
to the plot. <hi>Seneca</hi> wondred much to learne that ſo many perſons had beene
practiz'd in ſo ſhort a ſpace, and highly commended the enterpriſe. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis'd
his Nephew that they were to make all the haſte they could, for feare
ſo many perſons participating of the ſecret, there were not ſome one amongſt
them, whoſe courage might ſlacken. When <hi>Lucan</hi> had nam'd him the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of the conſpirators, he found that they had happily addreſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to all thoſe that were capable of keeping a ſecret, and wanted no cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
for the performance of it: yet he judged of the Senator <hi>Scevinus</hi> what
happened afterwards, for he ſaid, he was a man that had ſpirit enough, but
that a ſmall occaſion would trouble him; and that having ſo important a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
in his head, he feared leſt he might diſcover by his actions, what his
tongue would keepe cloſe enough. In the end <hi>Seneca</hi> going his way, advis'd
his Nephew to goe finde out <hi>Fenius Rufus,</hi> one of the Captaines of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
guards, and that he without doubt would joyne in the combination,
becauſe of the jealouſie he had againſt <hi>Tigellinus</hi> his companion, who had all
the credit about <hi>Nero;</hi> that he it was that had the beſt meanes to execute what
they deſir'd, and would not faile to have at his diſpoſition the Tribunes of the
guards, that ſought nothing ſo much as change.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Seneca</hi> was retired, I came out of the Cloſet where I was; and <hi>Lucan</hi>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:7768:161"/>
gave me charge to goe tell <hi>Piſo</hi> what I had heard, and he told me he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſee <hi>Rufus,</hi> whom he found diſpoſed juſt as <hi>Seneca</hi> had deſcrib'd him.
When the conſpirators knew that one of the Captaines of the guards was of
the party, they were much the more encouraged by it, eſpecially when he
came amongſt them; and now they made no more doubt of perfecting the
enterpriſe. All the queſtion was to know in what place <hi>Nero</hi> might be ſet
upon. One day being at <hi>Lucan's,</hi> I had a long conference with <hi>Rufus,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he declar'd more willingneſſe than I deſir'd: and the ſecond time he ſaw
me there, he drew me from beſides <hi>Attila,</hi> whom I was ſpeaking to; and
having taken me apart as if he would diſcourſe upon the ſubject of our plot,
he ſayes to me; I cannot but wonder, gentile <hi>Epicharis,</hi> that with ſo much
youth and beauty, you can have ſo grear a courage; and when I looke upon
you, me thinks I ſee the goddeſſe that takes protection of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by her
preſence encourages us to defeat the Tyrant. I anſwered him, there was no
beauty in me, and leſſe Divinity, but that a little courage I had, and tooke
great pleaſure to lend my reſentments and indevours to a benefit ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the world. Faire <hi>Epicharis,</hi> replies he, you oblige the whole earth by
this deſigne, but I will take part in the obligation above all others, if you
pleaſe to adde to that generall affection you have for all the world, a
particular friendſhip for me. I return'd thus; That I was not ignorant in
what degree I ought to honour him, and how much every one was behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to him for being willing to further us with his aſſiſtance; that in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
I ſhould thinke my ſelfe happy to doe him ſervice. Leave, ſayes he, theſe
words of honour, reſpect, and duty, and let us treat, I pray you, with more
familiarity: I confeſſe to you that your grace charmes mee, and that your
actions raviſh mee; and I beleeve this affection you are breeding, will bring
me trouble enough, if you helpe me not. If you have the pitty to conſider
of eaſing the whole world, refuſe not me alone a comfort, ſince you may
with farre leſſe danger effect it. <hi>Rufus,</hi> ſaid I to him, I underſtand not what
you meane by affection, paine, and comfort: they are words I am not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd
to, and I verily thinke it a crime to hearken to them. Let us not,
I pray you, make our ſelves unworthy of the favour is preſented us by the
gods, or thinke they will be ſerved of vitious perſons in ſo glorious a worke as
the ſafety of all men. What authority could we pretend to take away diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
if there were irregularity in our ſelves? and what grace ſhould we have
in going about to puniſh the crimes of others, if we rendred our ſelves in like
manner criminall? By this diſcourſe I ſomewhat moderated his deſires; yet
he never left importuning me ſtill; and afterwards he often ſent to intreat
me to come to his houſe, but I would never goe, knowing he had a deſigne
to ſpeake of ſomething elſe to me, beſide the conſpiracy againſt <hi>Nero,</hi> and to
tell you the truth, I beleeve he had conſpir'd againſt my ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>All things were then prepar'd, and it was reſolv'd that one of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
ſhould caſt himſelfe at <hi>Nero's</hi> feet as it were to aske ſome favour of him,
and then embracing his knees, ſhould give him a fall; and at the ſame time
<hi>Rufus</hi> with ſome Tribunes and Centurions of the guard, and the reſt of the
Conſpiracy ſhould fall upon him; <hi>Scevinus</hi> offered to give the firſt blow, and
to this purpoſe he wore a ponyard which he had taken out of a Temple. I
ordinarily retir'd my ſelfe at <hi>Maximus</hi> his; and one evening I was in a great
<pb facs="tcp:7768:161"/>
amaze to ſee many ſouldiers enter the houſe, and lay hold of me to be carried
before <hi>Nero.</hi> I beleev'd then the conſpiracy was all diſcovered, and reſolved
to dye: but when I was brought thither, I found it was nothing but this,
that <hi>Proculus</hi> having a deſpite that I would ſee him no more, had chang'd his
affection into hatred, and declar'd to the Emperour, how I had told him that
there was a powerfull conſpiracy againſt his life. They preſented me to him,
and when I had heard what he denounc'd, I denied that I ever communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any conjuration to him; not willing ſo much as to tell him that hee had
firſt ſpoken of it to me, for feare it ſhould have beene demanded why I had
not given advice of it ſooner, and it might be ſuſpected that I had ſince had
intelligence with ſome others. <hi>Rufus</hi> was preſent by <hi>Nero's</hi> ſide, and was in
feare both for himſelfe and me, thinking out of weakneſſe I would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the ſecret: but I asked <hi>Proculus</hi> whereupon he imagin'd I had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
any conſpiracy to him, and bade him name me but a man that were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
to the deſigne, out of my pretended relation. Hee was not able then to
name any body, and they began to mocke him that he grounded his accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no better. <hi>Rufus</hi> was well ſatisfied at my conſtancy; and it increas'd the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
he had to me: but although I had not beene convinc'd, they were
of opinion to retaine me priſoner; for they conſidered that a thing not well
averr'd might not be altogether falſe for all that.</p>
                  <p>Not long after came to paſſe what <hi>Seneca</hi> had foretold; for this <hi>Scevinus</hi>
having his minde poſſeſt with the deſigne of <hi>Nero's</hi> death, troubled himſelfe
with the foreſight of all he had to doe before dying, in caſe the conſpiracie
were detected. So impertinent was he as to make feaſts for his friends a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> if he
were to take leave of them; to make his will, to diſtribute his goods to his
ſervants; to prepare binding clothes for his wounds, and remedies to ſtay the
bloud, to ſerve him, if he ſhould chance to be hurt in the execution: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
he wore this ponyard he tooke out of a Temple, and could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine
giving out, that it was for ſome great deſigne: but the thing that
ruin'd us was, that this ill adviſed man gave that ſame poynard to one of his
freed men called <hi>Milichus,</hi> to ſharpen the point of it and make it very keene.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Milichus</hi> having conſidered all his Maſters actions of late, conceived he had
ſome plot againſt the life of the Prince, and expecting great recompences,
went to advertiſe <hi>Nero</hi> of it. <hi>Scevinus</hi> was preſently taken, who denied what
his freed man had ſaid, and reaſonably well ſatisfied all they demanded of him
touching thoſe preparatives: but when <hi>Milichus</hi> ſaid, how <hi>Scevinus</hi> the day
before had beene long in conference with <hi>Natalis</hi> the intimate friend of <hi>Piſo's,</hi>
and one of the conſpirators, <hi>Natalis</hi> was apprehended, and they were exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
apart upon the diſcourſe they had together in that conference. Their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
were different; and then they would have had them to the torture: but
they could not ſo much as endure the ſight of it, and confeſt all they knew of
the conjuration, and nam'd the greater part of the complices. <hi>Lucan</hi> was taken
inſtantly, and this man that made a ſhew of ſo much conſtancy, was ſo treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and ſo unworthy, as he accus'd his owne mother. <hi>Piſo</hi> and the other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
bin arreſted, detected their truſtieſt friends; and about that time they
remembred I was in priſon for the ſame ſuſpition, and they were in hope that
having a delicate body, I would never be able to ſuffer torments, but diſcover
ſtill many others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:7768:162"/>
I was brought before <hi>Nero,</hi> and commanded to name the reſt of the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie
to him. I would ſtill deny that I had any acquaintance with it; but at
laſt when I perceiv'd the ſecret was diſcovered, and <hi>Nero</hi> himſelfe having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
of me, what it was that moved me to attempt the taking away his life.
Becauſe, ſaid I to him with a confident looke and voice, thou art a parricide,
inceſtuous, and an infamous Stage-player; becauſe thou wilt exterminate
vertue from the earth: and the world can never be too ſoone deliver'd of thy
execrable cruelties. He bluſh'd to heare me ſpeake on that faſhion; perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
becauſe he had never heard ſo free a language before: being indeed
accuſtom'd to commit crimes, but not to be reproach't for them. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
they ſhould make me ſuffer all ſorts of puniſhment, to get the truth
out of my mouth; but as I went out of his preſence I bade him be aſſured that
my tongue ſhould expreſſe as much courage in ſaying nothing, as my arme
had ſhewne in ſtriking him.</p>
                  <p>It chanced that <hi>Rufus</hi> was not detected by any of thoſe that were taken;
and to teſtifie that he was none of the complices, he interpos'd himſelfe
ſtrongly in the Emperors ſervice to ſearch and examine the conſpirators, and
prevent the perill of his life. When he ſaw I was deſtin'd to torments, hee
tooke upon him the charge of fetching the truth out of me, himſelfe, and
commanded his Souldiours to carry mee into a private place, where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
made ready the torture; and ſome parts of my body were uncover'd.
<hi>Rufus</hi> had there only thoſe he commanded, and the greater part of them were
of our conſpiracy: nevertheleſſe ſeeing himſelfe reduc'd, either to put mee
cruelly to death, or elſe to run a danger of his owne life by endevouring to
ſave mee, he knew not what to reſolve on. He betooke himſelfe to a corner of
the priſon, where turning his face from mee, and leaning his forehead againſt
the wall, he wept, he tore his haire, and rent his clothes. In the meane while
his Souldiers attended his commands to torment me; till at length a Tribune
bolder than the reſt, that began to have pitty of mee, went to aske him if hee
deſir'd I ſhould be ſav'd; and that there was not a man of them who deſir'd it
not as well as himſelfe. But, anſwer'd <hi>Rufus,</hi> wee are undone if the Emperor
knowes it. Be confident in us, replied the Tribune: we are to make the
world beleeve ſhe died in the torments, as it was very likely ſhe had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to doe; and then we will bring her to your houſe, where you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of her as you pleaſe. <hi>Rufus</hi> let himſelfe be perſwaded, and the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
expreſſing much joy, help't me on with my clothes againe, and about
evening led mee away ſecietly to <hi>Rufus</hi> lodging.</p>
                  <p>From that time I fell from one miſery into another; for <hi>Rufus</hi> having me in
his hands, renued his evill deſires, in the very middeſt of the unquietneſſe he
mought have for feare of being accus'd by the conſpirators; and after he had
labour'd in vaine to vanquiſh mee by ſweetneſſe, he began to reproach mee
with the life he had conſerv'd, and to threaten that he would returne mee to
the torture he had deliver'd mee from. I let him ſee that I was as well invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
to menaces, as to gentler words, yet I beleeve he would have proceeded
unto violence, but for the ſuccours heaven ſent mee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rufus</hi> was ordinarily never from the Emperour, and abuſing the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
that they had not accuſed him, ſhewed himſelfe the more cruellin tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
the conſpirators, to the end he might not at all be ſuſpected. In the
<pb facs="tcp:7768:162"/>
end thoſe he ordain'd puniſhments to, being no longer able to endure that
one of the complices ſhould be the cruelleſt Inquiſitor, reſolved to accuſe
him. <hi>Scevinus</hi> being examin'd by him in preſence of the Emperor, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with greater torments if he declar'd not the truth, ſaid to him: There is
not a man knows more of it than thy ſelfe. <hi>Rufus</hi> ſtood confounded, and knew
not if he ſhould anſwer, or hold his peace; his feare ſoone diſcovered him,
and at the ſame time the others that were interrogated with <hi>Scevinus</hi> convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him: the Emperour commanded he ſhould be bound, and a while after
put him to death. As for me, I found meanes to eſcape out of his houſe, whileſt
his wife, his children, and his ſervants were all in deſolation and diſorder. I
went to <hi>Maximus</hi> his, who by good fortune had not bin accus'd by any of the
conſpiracy, and he was very joyfull to ſee me, for it was noyſed, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleev'd in the City that I was dead, after having teſtified an admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
in ſuffering the racke two dayes together, without declaring any thing,
and that I had ſtrangled my ſelfe. But not willing to ſtay at <hi>Rome</hi> any longer,
my honour having run ſo many fortunes, ſince I had bin knowne for a Mayd,
I re-aſſum'd the habit of a man to ſave myſelfe in. I tooke leave of <hi>Maximus</hi>
who gave me a little money, and an horſe, to goe and embarque me in ſome
Port or other, and returne into <hi>Sicily,</hi> where I hoped to heare newes of <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi>
I made a fortunate voyage, and arriving at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> I found no body at
<hi>Dicearchus</hi> houſe that could tell me any newes of you: but going to <hi>Telephus</hi>
his, he was much aſtoniſhed, with <hi>Erycine,</hi> to ſee me in that eſtate; and I learn'd
of <hi>Telephus</hi> that the ſhip that carried us into <hi>Epire</hi> was newly arriv'd, and how
you had ſent it backe againe, being deſirous to goe by land as farre as the Ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Sea, and from thence to paſſe into <hi>Aſia:</hi> and withall to advertiſe <hi>Telephus,</hi>
and thoſe that had charge of the affaires of <hi>Dicearchus, Palamede,</hi> and <hi>Ariana,</hi>
to ſend you what money they were able, for the need you had of it, being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to remaine in <hi>Aſia. Telephus</hi> told me he went to gather together what
he was able to bring you as well out of <hi>Melintus</hi> his, as his owne eſtate, and that
he was reſolv'd to goe finde you out himſelfe with <hi>Erycine,</hi> who would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
him. Very glad was I at ſo fit an encounter, to come away to you, and
two dayes after we departed with ſome of <hi>Dicearchus</hi> ſervants, that brought
him many commodities.</p>
                  <p>The wind was ſo favourable that we ſoone arriv'd in <hi>Epire,</hi> and having lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all our goods, we hir'd a wagon whereinto we loaded them, and went our
ſelves on horſebacke, with a purpoſe to goe the ſame way you had taken, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the advice you gave us. We were reſolv'd not to forſake the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
for the riches it was charg'd with, ſo as we thus paſſed through the <hi>Epire,</hi>
the mount <hi>Pindus,</hi> and all <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> going ſtill about it, with <hi>Telephus</hi> and <hi>Dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus</hi>
men, without ever making an ill encounter, but onely this day, when
we met with certaine inſolent ſouldiers who were pleas'd at <hi>Erycina's</hi> beauty,
and followed us into this City, never ceaſing to come about her, to touch her,
and affront us with many injurious ſpeeches. We had much adoe <hi>Telephus</hi> and
I to make oppoſition to them, yet we did it with gentleneſſe, for feare their
impudence ſhould have proceeded further; and thus we came into the City
where our wagon having bin ſtayed at the gate to be viſited, by reaſon of the
common practice during the wars, as I beleeve; we were conſtrain'd to leave
our men to gard it, &amp; come our ſelves away to put <hi>Erycine</hi> in ſafety. Thoſe ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:7768:163"/>
ſeeing we were now but three, followed us ſtill, and here hard by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves before their lodgings, and back'd with the preſence of their
companions, they would have forced <hi>Erycine</hi> to goe in with them, and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
made her come downe off her horſe. Inſtantly we allighted, <hi>Telephus</hi> and
I, to hinder this violence, and had our ſwords in our hands: but to abridge
the recite of what you know as well as we, <hi>Palamede</hi> and <hi>Amyntas</hi> gave us a
timely aſſiſtance, without whom we could not have long time reſiſted. And
now you have all that hapned to me ſince I was ſeparate from you: for the
preſent, it will not be amiſſe to ſend ſome body to have in our men and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage;
and afterwards we will adviſe together in what place the gods will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
us a retreat after ſo many ſtrange fortunes: for there is no doubt, but as
long as <hi>Nero</hi> lives we are to have a care that the names of <hi>Melintus, Palamede,</hi>
and <hi>Epicharis</hi> come no more to his eares.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Epicharis</hi> ended thus, and they all wondred at her, that ſhe ſhould conceive
ſo hardy an enterpriſe, onely for the ſafety of <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede;</hi> and that

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> who had beene hindred from going to <hi>Maxentius,</hi>
by reaſon of a great wound receiv'd of <hi>Palamede</hi> one night, as
ſoone as he was cur'd, underſtood that this Pretor was gone
with all the men of warre he had towards <hi>Lariſſa.</hi> He enquired
afterwards at the houſe where <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Ariana</hi> had lodged
in <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> what was become of them, and knew they had taken the way of
<hi>Theſſaly.</hi> He reſolv'd with himſelfe to follow them, and goe give advice to
<hi>Maxentius</hi> in <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> that ſearch might be made after <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Palamede,</hi>
to put them to death. He arriv'd there juſt at the time that <hi>Melintus,</hi> who
call'd himſelfe <hi>Alcydamas,</hi> returned laden with ſo many ſpoiles, and brought
backe <hi>Ariana.</hi> As he ſtayed a while to have that little triumph paſſe, he ſoone
knew <hi>Melintus,</hi> and <hi>Ariana,</hi> who went beſides him. He heard all was ſaid of
them, and learn'd that <hi>Melintus</hi> under the name of <hi>Alcydamas,</hi> had done great
exploits the day of the battell, and afterwards utterly defeated the <hi>Scythians</hi>
Camp with five hundred men only. The teſtimonies of the peoples joy for his
returne augmented the envy and rage of <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> who having enquir'd par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in what ſort all had paſſed, came to know that this <hi>Alcydamas</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any conſideration of the oath was taken by the Captaines, not to fight;
or regard to the puniſhment was to follow the contempt of his Generall, had
gone out by night to aſſault the enemies that carried away <hi>Ariana,</hi> and had
beene ſo valiant and happy as to defeat all that remain'd of the <hi>Scythians</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Theſſaly. Piſiſratus,</hi> in ſtead of admiring the faire effect of ſo brave a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
reſolv'd in his minde to make that valour ruinous to him that poſſeſſed
it: and when evening came, he went to <hi>Arimin,</hi> and repreſented to him
what fault he committed, to let the crime of this <hi>Alcydamas</hi> goe unpuniſhed;
of what conſequence it was to ſuffer the lawes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Diſcipline to be
violated, which untill then was not maintain'd but by ſeverity: that he would
remember alſo, how he made himſelfe forſworne, never thinking to have a
law of the <hi>Scythians</hi> obſerv'd, whereto he had bound himſelfe by oath. But
that above all theſe things he declar'd to him, how he that call'd himſelfe <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydamas,</hi>
was that <hi>Melintus</hi> deſtin'd to death by the Emperour, that had been
proclaim'd every where enemy to <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the people of <hi>Rome;</hi> that hee
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:7768:164"/>
would make <hi>Nero</hi> become ſuch an enemy to him, as would never pardon him,
when he knew that <hi>Melintus</hi> had beene in his power, and not put to death;
and that he drew upon himſelfe the ſame puniſhment he ſav'd <hi>Melintus</hi> from:
as for him, that he was reſolv'd to advertiſe the Prince of it, in ſatisfaction of
the allegeance he ought him; and that <hi>Arimin</hi> ſhould not thinke it ſtrange if
he gave advice of <hi>Melintus</hi> his being in his hands, who to the crime of high
treaſon had added that other of violating the lawes of Warre. <hi>Arimin</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at theſe words, and entring into the due apprehenſions of the fortune he
ran, not being able to thinke his owne life ſafe, as long as <hi>Melintus</hi> liv'd, gave
over all conſiderations of the friendſhip he bare him; and (albeit with regret
to ſee himſelfe forced to deſtroy ſuch a vertue,) reſolv'd to put him to death:
but becauſe he was ſo valiant, and ſo belov'd in <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> he judged that he was
to proceed in the deſigne with a great prudence and deliberation. He ſent for
all the Captaines, of whom againe he tooke the oath of fidelity, and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd
them that <hi>Alcydamas</hi> was that <hi>Melintus,</hi> enemy of <hi>Nero</hi> and the people of
<hi>Rome;</hi> that if they let him eſcape, their owne death would be inevitable. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having thus perſwaded them, and they had promiſed to preferre the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
they ought to <hi>Nero,</hi> to the conſervation of <hi>Melintus,</hi> hee ſent troops that
very morning to ſeize upon his lodging; one of the Captaines entred in with
his ſouldiers, and finding him in bed, commanded him from <hi>Arimin</hi> to dreſſe
himſelfe and follow him. That command ſurpriz'd him, not knowing what
change had hapned ſince the day before, and having put on his clothes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any amazement he demanded whither he was to goe. This Captaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
the command much againſt his will, for the eſteeme hee had of his
great courage, and was aſham'd thus to ſurpriſe without Armes, him that in
the warres would not alone have fear'd the encounter of a thouſand enemies;
ſo as by the way as he led him to the place appointed for his priſon, hee told
him, that one <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> was come to declare to <hi>Arimin,</hi> that his name was <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi>
and that he was the Emperour's enemy, and condemn'd to dye; that
he had withall threatned him, to give <hi>Nero</hi> advice of his diſobedience if hee
let him eſcape. <hi>Melintus</hi> advertis'd from whence his miſery came upon him,
was reſolv'd for death, ſeeing it was now unavoydable; and he was carefully
ſhut up, for feare ſome violence might be offered on their part that were affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
to him. In the meane time was a guard alſo ſet to keepe within their
houſe <hi>Palamede, Amyntas, Lepantus,</hi> and all thoſe that were able to make any
attempt for his deliverance, who knew not how this great alteration ſhould
come to paſſe, and there was nothing but aſtoniſhment and crying in that
houſe. The faire <hi>Ariana, Euphroſyne, Cyllenia,</hi> and <hi>Epicharis</hi> mingled their teares
together, and the leſſe they knew whence their griefe proceeded, the more
did they reſent it. The Gentlemen of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> that loved <hi>Melintus</hi> dearely,
were not wanting to him in this occaſion, but deputed ſome to goe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his ſafety of <hi>Arimin.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Lariſſa</hi> too finding themſelves redeua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him for all they had in the world, went and threw them downe upon
their knees before the Governour to demand his grace for him, but nothing
was capable to make him relent, ſo fearefull was he of <hi>Nero;</hi> and that if he
pardoned, they would never pardon him. The people deſir'd but to reſiſt this
injuſtice, yet they were retain'd by the ſouldiers they ſaw in Armes on all
ſides, and at laſt the life of <hi>Melintus</hi> was brought to that paſſe, that there was
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:7768:164"/>
no deliberation now but what kinde of puniſhment he ſhould ſuffer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arimin</hi> to make it appeare he was no violater of oaths, would needs have
that law of the <hi>Scythians</hi> executed, which he had ſworne to obſerve, if any
offence were committed againſt the prohibition made concerning fighting;
although it ſeem'd very inhumane to him, that a living mans heart ſhould be
torne out of his bowels, to have his head cut off afterwards. Nevertheleſſe
he would at once both ſatisfie his owne oath and <hi>Nero's</hi> deſire, knowing how
great a pleaſure he ſhould doe him, to bring him newes that his enemy
had beene puniſhed after ſo ſtrange a manner, for the love he had to new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of cruelty.</p>
               <p>He ſent in all haſte for the Prieſt of <hi>Lariſſa</hi> who ſerv'd at the goddeſſe <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>
Temple, telling him how by oath he was engaged to ſee executed a law
of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> that ordained for the puniſhment of every man that fought
againſt order given to the contrary, although he had return'd with victory,
that the criminall having beene carried in triumph through the City, ſhould
be brought upon a ſcaffold, where the Prieſt was to open his ſtomacke, and
take out the heart to be burnt with honour, but his head was to be cut off
by the hangman. The Prieſt asked him what reaſon there was for that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
law; he anſwered him, that the <hi>Scythians</hi> conceiv'd, how the heart that
was the ſeat of courage ought to be honoured, and the head that had fail'd
in government and obedience to be puniſhed. This Prieſt of <hi>Thetis</hi> refus'd
the execution, and ſaid he ſhould thinke himſelfe polluted by ſhedding of
humane bloud, and incapable of ever ſacrificing to the gods againe, who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not the murder of men, but were content with the ordinary ſacrifices
of beaſts: eſpecially that effuſion of humane bloud was forbidden them by a
particular Oracle of <hi>Thetis,</hi> which he could by no meanes diſobey. <hi>Arimin</hi>
when he could not diſpoſe him to ſerve that execution, ſent him away, and
call'd for the old ſacrificer of the <hi>Scythians</hi> who had taught the Law; when
he was brought before him, hee commanded him to performe the ſervice,
ſince he better knew in what faſhion it was to be obſerved. This good man
would have excus'd himſelfe, and ſaid he knew not the law but by recite,
had never ſeene it practiſed, and ſhould thinke himſelfe very unfortunate to
lend his hands to ſo cruell a puniſhment: but <hi>Arimin</hi> threatned him with
death if he contradicted him any longer. So this old man was conſtrain'd to
put on his habits of high Prieſt, and prepare himſelfe for that miſerable cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
He taught with much regret what was to be done, and preſently they
ſent to gather together all the arrowes they could get of the <hi>Scythians</hi> laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat;
then they ordain'd they ſhould be diſtributed to all the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> that
had aſſiſted <hi>Melintus,</hi> every man to carry his load of them at the triumph,
and afterwards to put them on a heape, wherein the victorious heart was to
be burned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> who was advertis'd of all that paſſed by him that had him in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
ſeeing that he was to dye, and knowing that <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> alone was cauſe
of his death meerely out of malice, ſent word to <hi>Arimin</hi> that he deſir'd but
two favours at his hands: the firſt, that he might fight with <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> before
he dyed, and puniſh him for his wickedneſſe; and the ſecond, that <hi>Ariana</hi>
might accompany him in the Chariot going in triumph, and that hee might
have the conſolation to hold her by the hand during the puniſhment, for to
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:7768:165"/>
dye betweene her armes. <hi>Arimin</hi> who was not cruell, nor hated <hi>Melintus,</hi>
granted him theſe two requeſts, provided that <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> conſented to the
firſt; and he beleev'd <hi>Melintus</hi> had found out this invention to let himſelfe
be kill'd in the combat rather than endure the ſhame and cruelty of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment;
and becauſe <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> might be in feare of <hi>Melintus,</hi> as a man
whoſe valour was of that eſteeme, he ſent for him, and told him, that <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
his deſigne was to dye, his armes in his hand, rather than by puniſhment:
that for this occaſion he had ſaid, that <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> was a traytor and a baſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
of purpoſe to provoke him to fight with him: that he might therefore
acquire much honour with little danger, by taking away the life of ſo valiant
a man, that had no other deſigne but to loſe it. <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> who wanted no
courage, was eaſily perſwaded by <hi>Arimin,</hi> finding himſelfe flattered alſo with
the hope of putting his enemy to death by his owne hand, and anſwered him,
that he accepted the Combat to make it appeare he was neither traytor nor
baſe fellow; the onely griefe he felt in this caſe, was to fight with a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
               <p>All that day paſſed on in theſe conteſtations, and in preparations for the
cruell ceremony. <hi>Palamede</hi> was diſtracted with fury to be ſhut up, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to know what they did with his friend. All was full of ſorrow in that
houſe, and <hi>Ariana</hi> never ceas'd pouring forth teares for the feare ſhee had of
what might befall her deare <hi>Melintus.</hi> But the day after when they came for
her to goe to him, and ſhe knew what paſſed, though they indevour'd to put
a reſolution into her, and perſwaded her to a conſtant ſupport of that misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
ſhe ſwooned at the very firſt hearing of ſo horrible a puniſhment. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
after ſhe was a little come to her ſelfe againe, they carried her into
the priſon, and ſet her beſide <hi>Melintus,</hi> who aſtoniſh'd all the world by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
conſtancy, and ſeeing her without colour and voyce, and ſo tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with griefe, addreſs'd his ſpeech to her thus:</p>
               <p>Faire and deare <hi>Ariana,</hi> you that have taken part in all the accidents of my
life, refuſe me not at this laſt the aſſiſtance I deſire of you. Since I have bin
ſo fortunate as to deliver you from the Barbarians, and returne you ſafe, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
me ſome time to enjoy the happineſſe of ſeeing you, and aſſiſt mee alſo,
now death is going to deliver me from the Barbarians, that have ordained it
mee. Courage, <hi>Ariana,</hi> let the world ſee, there never was ſo perfect a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
as ours: and that it has beene as conſtant in well ſuffering, as in well lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
<hi>Ariana,</hi> have a care you deface not by theſe teares the glory of your
excellent courage. Shall not ſhe that has vanquiſh'd the <hi>Scythians,</hi> overcome
ſorrow, which is not made ſtrong in us but by our weakneſſe? Deare <hi>Ariana,</hi>
if we have followed all our life the lawes of wiſdome, let us inforce our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in this laſt action; and in ſtead of giving pitty, give admiration to the
whole world. Shake not, I pray you, the force of my reſolution by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
of your griefe; and ſince the greatneſſe of your merits hath advanc'd
my courage, ruine not you your owne worke, but finde in your ſelfe the ſame
vertue which you have produc'd in me. Let us goe, my deare <hi>Ariana,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
no other favour of you till my death, but that I may hold this faire hand
you have given me, and after my ſoule is departed this body, that you would
expreſſe love enough to be able to ſurvive me.</p>
               <p>Never had <hi>Melintus</hi> Eloquence an effect ſo contrary to his deſire, for the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:7768:165"/>
more reaſons he alleaged to perſwade her unto Conſtancy, the more griefe
had <hi>Ariana</hi> to ſee ſo great a vertue ſo cruelly outraged. She could make him
no other returne but deep ſighes and teares, being impoſſible for her to have
better anſwered that ſhe could not be comforted, than by letting it appeare
that ſhe could not anſwer.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Melintus</hi> knew that all things were prepared, he call'd for his faire
Armes that had ſerv'd him the day of the battell; they were brought him
ſtreight, and after he had entirely arm'd himſelfe, except his head, he intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Ariana</hi> againe to reſolve to accompany and aſſiſt him to the very laſt
breath, ſince this favour was accorded him by <hi>Arimin.</hi> She let her ſelfe be led
away not able to ſtay her teares, and dying a thouſand times for ſorrow to
ſee her deare <hi>Melintus</hi> deſtin'd to a death ſo barbarous, and ſhee alone the
cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>The ſtreets, and the publike place were bordered with <hi>Arimin's</hi> ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
to hinder diſorders and commotions. The <hi>Theſſalians</hi> who had followed
<hi>Melintus</hi> in that glorious defeat, his onely crime, were commanded to goe
before diſarmed, and bearing their bundles of arrowes. When all were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in their order, they ſet up <hi>Melintus</hi> in a golden Chariot, armed as he was,
having his head onely uncovered, and his caſque at his feet. The deſolate <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi>
was ſet by him, whom he held by the hand. The Prieſt went afterwards
on horſebacke, and about him, thoſe that were neceſſary for the ſacrifice:
the hangman followed on foot, carrying a hatchet, and after him ſome other
officers. So began to march this funerall triumph, that drew teares from all
the company; every one conſidering the glorious cauſe <hi>Melintus</hi> was to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in. His face ſo cleare, and his countenance ſo aſſured neare ſo cruell a
death, affected the hardeſt courages that were preſent; but the ſofter natures,
as the greater part of the people by their complaints and cryes teſtified how
ſenſibly they were touched with compaſſion. On the other ſide, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
teares and heavy fighings of <hi>Ariana</hi> broke all hearts with pitty, in ſuch
ſort as the conſtancy of the one, and the weakneſſe of the other wrought an
equall diſpleaſure in all. But the ſage diſcourſes of the vertuous <hi>Melintus,</hi>
whereby he endevoured to reſolve her, being heard, added great aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the common griefe; and in the end when they had thus paſſed the
ſtreets, and gone round about the place, the Chariot was driven to the foot
of the ſcaffold that had beene erected, in the middeſt of which was an Altar
where the ſacred knives lay. By and by arriv'd at the place from another ſide
<hi>Arimin,</hi> bringing with him <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> all armed on horſebacke, and ſent ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
horſe to <hi>Melintus.</hi> The Prieſt and <hi>Ariana</hi> aſcended the ſcaffold, and ſate
them downe upon two ſeats that were on each ſide of the Altar, and <hi>Melintus</hi>
after he had promiſed <hi>Ariana</hi> to returne preſently to her, took his leave of her;
and when he had put on his head-peece mounted on horſebacke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arimin</hi> caus'd the ſouldiers that were at the ports, and in the ſtreets to come
thither and re-inforce the guards of the place for feare of an inſurrection,
ſeeing the wills of the people hotly inclin'd towards <hi>Melintus,</hi> who was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at one of the ends of the Camp, and <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> at the other, having each
of them but one great Javelin in their hand, and their ſwords by their ſide.
<hi>Ariana</hi> unſeene had ſeized one of the knives that were upon the Altar, for to
kill her ſelfe with it if <hi>Melintus</hi> dyed in the combat, and full of feare and horror
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:7768:166"/>
regarded what the iſſue would be. The trumpets ſounded, and inſtantly <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>
and <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> rode one againſt the other; as they approached, they dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their javelins; that of <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> lightly ſtrucke againſt <hi>Melintus</hi> Armes,
but <hi>Melintus</hi> his parting from a more dextrous and puiſſant arme, pierced tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
his Armour, and faſtened it ſelfe very deep into his left ſhoulder. Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they tooke their ſwords in hand, <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> enflam'd with fury againſt <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and with deſpight that he ſpared him not, and <hi>Melintus</hi> mov'd with his
owne great courage, and a deſire to puniſh the villany of <hi>Piſiſtratus. Melintus</hi>
in a moment ſhowr'd his blowes as thicke as haile upon the Armes of <hi>Piſiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
without ſcarcely giving him leiſure to lift an arme up, and after hee had
made flye about the place the peeces of his armour and caſque, in the end ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his ſtomacke with a large wound: then ſeeing he was going to fall, he cut
off his head at one blow, and ſo puniſhed him with the ſame death he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for him.</p>
               <p>This combat ended, the people began to clap their hands, and cry out, <hi>Save
the brave Melintus;</hi> but he never ſtaying for theſe acclamations, and hoping
for no grace, return'd of himſelfe towards the ſcaffold, whereupon he moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and bade they ſhould diſarme him to finiſh what was ordain'd for him:
only he intreated that he might not be bound. In the meane time he comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Ariana,</hi> and prayed her not to envy him by her teares ſo glorious a death:
that nothing but her griefe leſſened the contentment he went to dye in, after
having ſav'd her out of the hands of the Barbarians, after having acquir'd ſo
many victories, and puniſhed his principall enemy. Well, <hi>Ariana,</hi> ſaid he, what
could we more have deſired of the gods, but to let us enjoy our affection with
repoſe? If they refuſe me an idle life, and ordaine mee to dye now there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
no more honour for me to acquire, ought I to complaine of them for
retiring me in the moſt illuſtrious period of my life? No, <hi>Ariana,</hi> I well ſee you
doe not complaine for me; contrarily you envy my death: but yet peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
you mourne for this, to be abandon'd by me. Ah! my deare <hi>Ariana,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
your ſelfe, and live without that feare. I wil be the happy Genius that ſhall
aſſiſt you inceſſantly untill the gods have diſpos'd of you: I will remove all
misfortunes from you, I will conduct your wayes and your actions, that you
may incounter nothing but happineſſe; and you ought to be aſſur'd to have
me alwayes at your ſide; by day I will inviſibly aſſiſt you, and by night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with you in pleaſing dreams. Prevent not, my deare <hi>Ariana,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinies
that are ordain'd you: you are to ſhew as much conſtancy for life, as I
ought to have for death. Adieu, my deare <hi>Ariana,</hi> be comforted, and live for
my ſake, as from my heart I am going to dye for yours. Then he came nearer
her to give his laſt kiſſe: but ſhe not able to endure that cruell farewell, in the
middeſt of her ſighings at laſt let eſcape theſe words: O gods! O heaven! ah
<hi>Melintus,</hi> I dye; and fell downe thus in a ſwoone upon the ſcaffold. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
they brought her againe with water they threw upon her face, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
her eyes ſhe knew what fault ſhe made to let <hi>Melintus</hi> dye on that faſhion
without aſſiſting him: then taking courage, ſhe look'd whether ſhe had ſtill
the knife about her which ſhe had hidden, and when ſhee found it ſhe made a
ſhew of reſolution. At that time <hi>Melintus</hi> being undreſt to the girdle, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the honorable pile they had prepared of the enemies arrowes for to burne
his heart in, he turned him towards <hi>Ariana,</hi> and ſaid to her: Deare <hi>Ariana,</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:7768:166"/>
demand yet one grace of you after my death; 'tis that this heart which hath
lov'd you ſo well, when it ſhall be taken out of my breſt, may be receiv'd into
your faire hands, and carried by you to be burned upon this pile. Permit not,
faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> that this heart, that feeles it ſelfe ſo noble for loving you, be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by other hands than yours, and ſee that having never burnt but for you,
it be not alſo burnt but by you. What joy think you will it receive, when after
having adored you ſo much without knowing you but by deſire, it ſhall feele
it ſelfe carried by theſe hands ſo faire, and ſo belov'd? <hi>Ariana,</hi> promiſe me this
favour: have no horror to touch a thing that hath ador'd you, and deſpiſe not
after my death this part of my ſelfe, which in its little ſpace contain'd ſo much
love and affection to you. I give it you, to be ſacrific'd by you to your ſelfe;
and be aſſur'd, there never was an offering purer, or preſented with more
ardour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariana</hi> having other reſolutions in her minde, promis'd the conſtant <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
that ſhe would obey all his deſires; and after they had a long time embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
one another to give their laſt adieu, the old Prieſt with teares in his eyes
bade <hi>Melintus</hi> overthrow himſelfe upon the Altar, that hee might open his
breſt. And then this brave and generous courage quitting at laſt his deare <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi>
though never letting goe her hand, laid himſelfe downe backwards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Altar, having his ſtomack all naked, and bade the Prieſt diſpatch. When
<hi>Ariana</hi> ſaw he had taken the ſacred knife, and bent himſelfe downe upon <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi>
ſhe could not ſupport the cruelty of that ſight, but turning her head,
tooke out the knife ſhe had hid, then ſhe ſtretch'd out her hand as farre as ſhe
was able to ſtrike it with more force into her boſome.</p>
               <p>But the cry which at that time the Prieſt gave, troubled her, and made her
turne her head to ſee what had befallen him. The good old man that very
unwillingly lent his hand to ſo cruell an office, comming nearer with his eyes
to <hi>Melintus</hi> breſt, and ſeeing the marke of the heart which he had from his
birth, fell a crying out, Ah my ſonne, ah <hi>Melintus,</hi> the true bloud of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>
and <hi>Achilles,</hi> never will I be your executioner. Then having let fall the knife,
he fell downe himſelfe too with aſtoniſhment and weakneſſe. All the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
deſir'd to know what it was. <hi>Arimin</hi> himſelfe came neare with his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and officers, thinking this old man out of pitty refuſed to execute what
he had promiſed, and ask'd him why he diſpatched not. The good man not
able to ſpeake but with paine, ſayes to him, 'Tis my ſonne, 'tis the divine race
of <hi>Achilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Preſently they heard a man cry out in the preaſe to have place made him,
and to ſtay the execution. This man was knowne to be <hi>Thetis</hi> Prieſt in <hi>Lariſſa;</hi>
and <hi>Arimin</hi> beleeving, that after he had better conſidered it, hee would not
ſuffer any other but himſelfe to performe the office of High Prieſt at ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
an occaſion within the City, made him come forward, and aſcend the
ſcaffold. But as ſoone as he was there, he commanded ſilence, and addreſſing
his ſpeech to the Governour, ſaid to him; <hi>Arimin,</hi> beware of putting to
death this man, for he is of the bloud of the gods: then ſhewing an old booke
he brought with him, he proceeded, that being deſirous to review the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Oracle wherein was forbidden them to ſacrifice men, he had read theſe
verſes, which he pronounc'd:</p>
               <lg>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:7768:167"/>
                  <l>LEt all my Sacrificers dread</l>
                  <l>The blood of humane kind to ſhed,</l>
                  <l>If from my ancient progeny</l>
                  <l>You deſire a King to have:</l>
                  <l>When ſo eaſily you may ſave</l>
                  <l>His heart from <hi>Scythian</hi> cruelty.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Then he made <hi>Arimin</hi> read this Oracle out of the old booke, where it was
recited how the Kings that were of the race of <hi>Achilles,</hi> having failed in
<hi>Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Epire,</hi> the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> had conſulted the goddeſſe <hi>Thetis,</hi> to know
whom they ſhould chooſe for their Commander; whereupon they had this
anſwer, and never a King ſince. The Prieſt added, that it was very cleare
<hi>Melintus</hi> was meant by the Oracle; and that his heart ought to be preſerved
from the cruelty of this <hi>Scythian</hi> law: it remain'd onely to be confirmed
how he came of the bloud of <hi>Achilles:</hi> for his part he thought that his vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
actions had already given powerfull teſtimonies thereof. The other Prieſt
who by that time had made himſelfe knowne to <hi>Melintus</hi> for his father <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrates,</hi>
that was ſold to the <hi>Scythians</hi> by the Pyrats, aſſured <hi>Arimin</hi> and the
High Prieſt of <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> that <hi>Melintus</hi> was of the true race of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles,</hi>
and that proofe of it was eaſie to be made at <hi>Syracuſe. Arimin</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them, that admit it were ſo, yet the Emperour would never ſuffer the
<hi>Theſſalians</hi> to withdraw themſelves out of his government. The Prieſt of
<hi>Thetis</hi> replied, that <hi>Melintus</hi> might well hold the kingdome upon the ſame
conditions which other Kings did that relieved of the Empire. But <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
rejecting a thing ſo farre from his intention, and which he beleev'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
invented to ſave <hi>Melintus,</hi> was reſolv'd to proceed on, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his ſouldiers to mount the ſcaffold, and goe kill <hi>Melintus,</hi> who at the ſame
time was left without all motion for aſtoniſhment, with <hi>Ariana</hi> by him, to ſee
ſo many novelties.</p>
               <p>But a new rumour that was ſpread about the place hindered the ſouldiers
from obeying <hi>Arimin:</hi> It was <hi>Eurymedon</hi> with three thouſand men, that
had entred the City, having found the Ports without guard, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
what danger <hi>Melintus</hi> was in, marched on towards the place. He
began inſtantly with a cry from all ſides made by his men, Save <hi>Melintus,</hi>
or ye dye all. <hi>Arimin</hi> being ignorant what it might be, called all his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and ranged them about him: then hee ſent to know who theſe new
arrived were. In the meane time many <hi>Theſſalians</hi> had already mounted
the ſcaffold, and ſaluted <hi>Melintus,</hi> in kiſſing his hands, and calling him their
King promiſed by the Oracles; and told him that as hee was heire of the
beauty and valour of <hi>Achilles,</hi> he muſt be alſo the legitimate ſucceſſor of his
kingdome. <hi>Melintus</hi> rejected theſe ſubmiſſions and names, and thought of
nothing but embracing and honouring his father. <hi>Ariana</hi> alſo rendred him
her dutifull reſpects, and they conſidered all three together the ſtrange e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of things, that gave them ſome hope amidſt a great deale of feare.
<hi>Arimin</hi> at that time was much troubled, ſeeing himſelfe environ'd with
ſo many people, whoſe number he thought yet greater: but <hi>Melintus,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
knowne of <hi>Eurymedon's</hi> comming, prayed <hi>Arimin</hi> to come neare him,
<pb facs="tcp:7768:167"/>
and ſayes to him, I perceive well many things concurre to ſave mee, but I
know as well, that if the Emperour deſires my death, there is nothing can
preſerve mee. I flatter not my ſelfe with the hope of the kingdome of
<hi>Theſſaly;</hi> 'tis a thing farre from my deſires, though it be true that I am of
the bloud of <hi>Achilles:</hi> but, <hi>Arimin,</hi> for the preſent I counſell you to deferre
my putting to death, untill you heare further of the Emperours pleaſure: not
that this delay can promiſe me any ſafety, but becauſe you cannot otherwiſe
be aſſured of your owne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arimin</hi> agreed to what he ſaid, bearing no ill will to <hi>Melintus,</hi> and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
himſelfe troubled at all theſe encounters: then he prayed him to goe
move thoſe men of warre, that they might treat as friends. <hi>Melintus</hi> went
towards them on horſebacke; and when <hi>Eurymedon</hi> perceiv'd him, he ran
to embrace him, and conſented to what ever he deſired at his hands: but
hee would never ſuffer him to returne any more to <hi>Arimin.</hi> The people
joyned themſelves preſently to their party, and they all called <hi>Melintus</hi>
their King and their Protector, and cryed aloud, they would protect him
well enough, ſince hee had ſo well protected them. <hi>Melintus</hi> refuſed all
thoſe honours, and ſent to aſſure <hi>Arimin,</hi> that hee conſented not to them,
and would never attempt any thing againſt the authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
onely hee beſought him that hee would aſſiſt him favourably with
<hi>Nero,</hi> to appeaſe his anger. <hi>Arimin</hi> reſtored by this aſſurance, and who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
but peace, promiſed hee would ſerve him with all affection neare the
Emperour, and then retired himſelfe into the Caſtle. <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medon</hi>
went away towards the ſcaffold to take with them <hi>Hermocrates</hi> and
<hi>Ariana,</hi> who were confounded for joy to ſee themſelves delivered out of ſo
great perils. <hi>Eurymedon</hi> having ſaluted the faire <hi>Ariana,</hi> told her, hee had
brought a Princeſſe to be her companion: they were then impatient to ſee
the faire <hi>Paſithea</hi> whom <hi>Eurymedon</hi> had left behinde, when hee advanced
towards the place to ſave <hi>Melintus. Ariana</hi> at that time was ſet on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
and <hi>Paſithea</hi> in the ſame equipage comming to encounter her in a
guard of ſouldiers, they would both of them alight for their better recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of themſelves, having heard very advantageouſly one of another. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſalutations and complements, every one began to judge of theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
beauties, that were both of them marvellous: nevertheleſſe that of
<hi>Ariana</hi> ſurpaſſed the other by farre, and thoſe that knew the ſtrange effects
of <hi>Paſithea's,</hi> were in a wonder that <hi>Ariana</hi> being the faireſt, was not ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
belov'd: but the ableſt judgements comparing the majeſtuous grace
of <hi>Ariana,</hi> with the familiar ſweetneſſe of <hi>Paſithea,</hi> were agreed that the
laſt kindled all deſires in an inſtant, producing hope by this generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſance:
but that <hi>Ariana</hi> by her beauty indeed ſtirr'd up an admiration,
but by her gravity accompanied with modeſty, ſtrucke hope dead, which
is the onely nouriſher of love: in ſuch ſort as ſhe could not be loved but by
men of great courage that feared not the difficulties, whereas <hi>Paſithea</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitated
her ſelfe the birth of love by her naturall ſweetneſſe, that gave ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
to all, and yet with no other deſigne, than nobly to favour thoſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
her.</p>
               <p>They all retired to the lodging that was given them at firſt, which was the
moſt remarkable houſe in the Towne, whence were comming forth the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:7768:168"/>
ſouldiers that guarded <hi>Palamede, Euphroſyne,</hi> and the reſt, for <hi>Arimin</hi> had ſent
them a countermand that they ſhould returne to wait upon him. There were
given in that place embracings without number, for if ſome of them had
run great hazards, the others had beene in great feares for them. <hi>Euphroſyne</hi>
was neare dying for joy to ſee <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> he was a long time alſo without
being able to quit her, after ſo tedious and cruell a ſeparation from her: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
he embraced one while <hi>Telephus</hi> his faithfull friend, another while
<hi>Epicharis</hi> his daughter; and told them how he had beene ſold to the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
from whom he never could have hoped to be delivered, but for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
was taken by a great number of them, to goe ſeeke out other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and they had brought him along with them, and conſtrained him to
be their Sacrificer, becauſe they had obſerved him to have ſome knowledge
in naturall things. The others related alſo to one another their divers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and above all <hi>Palamede</hi> expreſs'd the diſpleaſures hee had received
with <hi>Amyntas,</hi> for being kept enclos'd during the extreme danger <hi>Melintus</hi>
was in, for which was left them no other conſolation than their deare Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
<hi>Epicharis</hi> and <hi>Erycine,</hi> who nevertheleſſe had no leſſe griefe than
they, whereof the one was then ſiſter to <hi>Melintus,</hi> the other had beene ſo
heretofore. When <hi>Eurymedon</hi> knew that his friend <hi>Lepantus</hi> kept his bed
for the wounds he receiv'd in defending the Ladies, he went to him into his
Chamber, where he found <hi>Cyllenia</hi> alone with him, aſſiſting him with much
affection: but ſeeing that his wounds would not be cured a long time by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
remedies, he caus'd an excellent drogue to be brought him which
hee was accuſtomed to uſe himſelfe, and two dayes after his wounds were
cloſed. In the meane while the faithfull <hi>Arcas</hi> kiſt his deare Maſters hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
raviſh'd to ſee him yet living, after ſo perilous a fortune: There was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
rejoycing in that houſe, and abroad too, becauſe of the <hi>Theſſalians</hi>
that ſhouted a thouſand times for joy to have found a King ſo wiſe, ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
and ſo accompliſh'd as <hi>Melintus</hi> was. They had aſſembled together, to
make a guard about his houſe, and were reſolv'd to dye all, rather than ſuffer
he ſhould have any diſpleaſure offered him.</p>
               <p>All the feare <hi>Melintus</hi> had was on <hi>Nero's</hi> ſide, whoſe choler hee judged
would increaſe, when hee came to know that hee pretended to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Theſſaly.</hi> But <hi>Arimin</hi> the day after ſent him word of the happy
newes were but then brought him, that <hi>Nero</hi> was dead; and that his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was curſed all the world over, as of an execrable monſter; how <hi>Galba</hi> had
beene declar'd Emperour, and was upon the point to paſſe out of <hi>Spaine</hi> into
<hi>Italy.</hi> Then their contentments were perfected. All the people ran preſently
to the Temples, to give the gods thanks for having taken out of the world
the Tyrant; and the nobleſt of the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> intreated <hi>Arimin</hi> that they
might goe to <hi>Rome</hi> and demand of <hi>Galba Melintus</hi> for their King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Arimin</hi>
willing to ſerve <hi>Melintus</hi> in that occaſion, that he might give him cauſe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the injuries he had done him, not onely granted what they deſired of
him, but would alſo accompany them himſelfe to make relation to the
new Emperour of <hi>Melintus</hi> his extreme valour, by whoſe onely meanes,
the <hi>Scythians</hi> had beene profligated, before ever any newes came to <hi>Rome</hi>
of their deſcent. After having viſited <hi>Melintus,</hi> and taken leave of him, he
left a Lievtenant in his place, and would be gone: <hi>Palamede</hi> who had learn'd
<pb facs="tcp:7768:168"/>
that <hi>Otho</hi> return'd with <hi>Galba,</hi> and at that time had all the power with him,
obtain'd of <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Epicharis</hi> that he might alſo make that voyage, to the
end <hi>Otho</hi> being oblig'd by their ancient friendſhip, might favour <hi>Melintus</hi> with
the Emperour, and ſo they departed all together.</p>
               <p>In the meane time they prepar'd at <hi>Lariſſa</hi> with all magnificence the
feaſts for the wedding of <hi>Melintus,</hi> whom already they call'd their King,
and <hi>Ariana</hi> whom they named the Goddeſſe of the <hi>Scythians.</hi> An old Pyrat
that ordinarily accompanied <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Hermocrates</hi> and <hi>Euphroſyne</hi>
whom hee remembred to have beene amongſt them, and having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
all that had happened to them, and how they were the parents of
the brave and noble <hi>Melintus</hi> the deare friend, and heretofore conquerour
of his Maſter, would give a new ſupply to their joyes by diſcovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to them. He deſired their pardon firſt of all, for having made them
endure ſo many miſeries, for which, ſayes hee, I can never acquit my ſelfe
towards you, but in making you a preſent of incomparable value. I give
you, proceeds he, <hi>Eurymedon</hi> my Maſter for your ſonne. Every one ſtood
in a great amazement, and <hi>Eurymedon</hi> too, whom hee addreſſed himſelfe
to and ſaid, <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> that I ſay is true, and I beleeve you are not ſorry
(having alwayes beene kept in the opinion of being a Prince) to finde your
ſelfe now deſcended of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> and <hi>Achilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They could not yet comprehend how it might be; but this Pyrat conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued:
I came to know, ſaid hee to <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> that you underſtood how
<hi>Dicearchus</hi> had oblig'd us to put to death what ſhould be borne of you, till
the time you were ſold. The firſt childe you brought into the world while
you were with us, was this <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> whom we preſently tooke and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a little mantle towards the Sea, for to have caſt him in. But as wee
were in the way, there comes an Eagle and takes him out of our hands,
when we thought of nothing but carrying him away, and throwing up her
ſelfe into the ayre, flew at length ſtooping downe towards a place wee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
We ran inſtantly thither out of curioſity, and after wee had a long
time ſearched, we found the Babe at laſt, which the Eagle had hid under a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.
We conjectured from thence that hee would one day prove illuſtrious,
ſince the King of Birds was willing to ſave him, and had given him for ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
the tree ordained to crowne the victorious: ſo we reſolved to bring
him up, and that hee ſhould ſerve us for our Conqueſts: but not willing
<hi>Euphroſyne</hi> knew him to be hers, having a purpoſe to make himſelfe beleeve
one day that he was of Royall bloud to heighten his courage; wee made
him be nurſed ſome dayes by a woman, and after that wee return'd him to
you, ſaid he to <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> to have him better nouriſhed, feining it was a
Kings childe we had taken; and ever ſince hee lived as you know. As they
were upon theſe rejoycings, and <hi>Paſithea</hi> in a rapture to know the illuſtrious
and valiant race of her deare <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> word was brought them that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelaus</hi>
had followed them, and was very neare entring into the City. <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
would goe forth to meet him in equipage of a Prince, being accompanied
with <hi>Eurymedon, Lepantus,</hi> and <hi>Amyntas,</hi> to the end hee might procure that
his new acknowledg'd brother were receiv'd into his favour. <hi>Archelaus</hi> at his
arrivall in the Port had learn'd that <hi>Melintus</hi> was deſtin'd to be King of <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaly,</hi>
and that he was of the bloud of <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> ſo as when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:7768:169"/>
they ſaluted as Kings; and <hi>Melintus</hi> ſeeing much ſadneſſe in his
face, ſaid to him: Great Prince, you muſt here quit all reſentments of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
againſt thoſe you purſue, and keepe the promiſe you have given. See
there my brother, ſaid he ſhewing <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> whom you have promis'd your
alliance, and I pray you receive him into your grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Archelaus</hi> knew not what <hi>Melintus</hi> meant to tell him, but hee proceeded;
Wonder not if I ſay you promiſed my brother your alliance: This is that
faire <hi>Hermione</hi> that had the good fortune to ſuccour you ſo timely at the day
of battell, and whoſe beauty was able to touch your heart with affection. His
name is <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> and it is hee that after having ſaved the Princeſſe your
daughter whom they would have ſtollen away, was ſo happy as to be loved of
her. He was conſtrain'd ſo to diſguiſe himſelfe, fearing your anger; aſcribe
to his paſſion the enterpriſe he conceived to abuſe you, and change I pray you
the love you had for <hi>Hermione,</hi> into a friendſhip for <hi>Eurymedon. Archelaus</hi>
was ſo confounded with that he heard, as he ſtood without all motion; and
by this time the faire <hi>Eurymedon</hi> threw himſelfe downe at his feet to deſire
pardon for the fault he had made in carrying away his daughter. At laſt the
King conſidering that if he expreſs'd more anger, it would but turne to his
owne confuſion, was reſolv'd to embrace <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> knowing him of a birth
that made him worthy of his daughter; and when the peace was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them, they brought him into the City, where <hi>Paſithea</hi> came out to
meet him, conducted by the faire <hi>Ariana.</hi> She caſt her ſelfe at his feet, and he
pardon'd her in lifting her up, and was willing to ſtay in that place to aſſiſt at
the ceremony of <hi>Melintus</hi> Coronation, and celebrate the nuptials of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as well as thoſe of <hi>Ariana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During ſome dayes as they were thus rejoycing together for ſo many paſt
travels, and the hope of a fortune for <hi>Melintus</hi> becomming his Heroike
vertue, and admirable actions, thoſe that were gone for <hi>Rome</hi> arrived hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
there, and in a ſmall time made the ſingular ſervices <hi>Melintus</hi> had done
the Empire be in ſuch ſort acknowledged, that they obtained what they
deſired with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Otho,</hi> who ſhewed himſelfe paſſionate for his
friend <hi>Melintus,</hi> and for the faire <hi>Ariana</hi> whom hee had ſo ſuddenly and
ardently heretofore loved; and <hi>Palamede</hi> was made Knight of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
with that title created Governour of <hi>Sicily. Arimin, Palamede,</hi> and the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalians</hi>
returned in great haſte, and brought <hi>Melintus</hi> the Emperours letters,
with the Decree of the Senate, whereby the kingdome of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and of
a part of <hi>Epire</hi> was given him, as being the legitimate heire of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> and
<hi>Achilles,</hi> to whom they wiſhed all proſperity for the important ſervices he
had rendred to the Empire, whereof notwithſtanding he ſhould releeve,
exhorting him withall to continue the ſame cares for conſerving the <hi>Roman</hi>
limits againſt the inundations of Barbarians. Then <hi>Arimin</hi> preſented
two rich Crownes of gold ſent from the Emperour, one to the valiant <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi>
and the other to the faire and vertuous <hi>Ariana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Theſſalians</hi> every where made fires of joy for ſo happy a newes, and
to the end ſo many rejoycings were not made in confuſion, but that each of
them might be reſented in particular, the next day was deſtin'd for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation
and marriage of <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Ariana:</hi> The day after for the Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
of the Prince <hi>Eurymedon</hi> with the Princeſſe <hi>Paſithea;</hi> and the third day
<pb facs="tcp:7768:169"/>
for the marriages of <hi>Palamede</hi> with <hi>Epicharis,</hi> of <hi>Lepantus</hi> with <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> and of
<hi>Amyntas</hi> with <hi>Erycine.</hi> The Deputies of all the Cities of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> that attended
at <hi>Lariſſa</hi> the returne of the Ambaſſadors, came to congratulate with their King
given by the gods and promis'd by their Oracles, and to take the oath of allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to him; and the whole City was full of employment againſt the next daies
Ceremony.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of <hi>Lariſſa</hi> had ſtrewed all the ſtreets with flowers, and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
themſelves with them, to make that the moſt celebrious and agreeable day
they could poſſibly. Betimes in the morning every man went to diſpoſe himſelfe
before <hi>Melintus</hi> gate; and they brought him to the Temple with <hi>Ariana</hi> in this
order. The ſouldiers as well of the City as thoſe that <hi>Eurymedon</hi> and King <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
had brought, were ſet in rowes all along the ſtreets whereby the pomp was
to paſſe to the Temple of <hi>Thetis.</hi> Many trumpets were in the head of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of <hi>Theſſalian</hi> Gentlemen, which <hi>Melintus</hi> had led the day of the battell: then
they cauſed to march ſtore of Chariots loaden with the ſpoiles of the <hi>Scythians.</hi>
Afterwards were carried in Trophey the armes of their King whom <hi>Melintus</hi>
had ſlain: then the Barbarian priſoners were led with their hands bound behind
them; after them followed on horſebacke two by two, the five hundred brave
<hi>Theſſalians</hi> that had ſerved <hi>Melintus</hi> in the valiant night-enterpriſe, having their
armes all ſilvered, and rich capariſons upon their horſes: the javelins they carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
were inwreath'd with flowers, and their heads crowned with laurell. In the
middeſt of them was led in hand of both ſides <hi>Melintus</hi> his horſe, that ſeem'd
to be growne prouder for the fortune of his Maſter, ſo ſtately was his pace. Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
white Buls followed for the ſacrifice, having their hornes and hooves gilded
their heads adorn'd with flowers, and cover'd all over with tapiſtry of ſilke tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
on the ground. The Prieſts went after the offerings, and carried all things
neceſſary for ſacrifice. A little after ten young gentlemen of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> clothed
in white, and crown'd with flowers, bare upon their ſhoulders a kind of Chariot,
in the middeſt whereof was a Carpet of purple, with the fringes of gold training
to the ground, whereupon was laid the Crowne of gold, and the Scepter for <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus:</hi>
then followed ten of the faireſt Maids of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> clothed alſo in white<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with their haire looſe and crowned with flowers, that bare up another Chariot
beautified with purple, the fringe of gold, upon which was the other Crowne
and Scepter for <hi>Ariana. Arimin</hi> the Emperours Ambaſſadour, and King <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
followed in order on horſeback, one beſide the other, environ'd with their
Officers. After them march'd the triumphant Chariot of <hi>Melintus</hi> and <hi>Ariana,</hi> all
glittering with gold, and adorn'd with poſies of flowers, drawne by ſix white
horſes of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> that had their maines braided with incarnate ribbands of ſilke
mingled with gold and ſilver, whereon were mounted ſix young children win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
after the faſhion of <hi>Cupids.</hi> The valiant <hi>Melintus</hi> then attracted the eyes of
all; he was crowned with laurell, and wore a cloake of purple Royall laced with
gold, holding the hand of the divine <hi>Ariana,</hi> that was dreſt like a Queene, and
whoſe admirable beauty animated by the joy of ſo much happineſſe &amp; applauſe
had a ſplendour, the beames whereof were yet unſupportable for dazeling the
beholders, and giving a delightfull raviſhment to their eyes. The valorous <hi>Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medon</hi>
followed on horſebacke, by the ſide of the faire <hi>Paſithea,</hi> that was likewiſe
mounted a horſebacke upon a foot-cloth of embroydery of gold, being ſuſtain'd
on both ſides by two Lesbian Gentlemen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Palamede</hi> went in that faſhion after
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:7768:170"/>
and made himſelfe admir'd of all, as well for his pleaſing mine, as the grace hee
had in managing his horſe. The gentile <hi>Epicharis</hi> went beſides him after the ſame
manner that <hi>Paſithea,</hi> having, I know not what, more gravity in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
ſince from a ſlave ſhe became to be a Princeſſe. After them followed <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pantus</hi>
with <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> mounted likewiſe, and then <hi>Amyntas</hi> with <hi>Erycine. Telephus</hi>
went alone on horſebacke, and was followed with a Chariot wherein were <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrates</hi>
and <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> that lift up their hands without ceaſing, and gave thanks
to heaven for having put ſo happy an end to their misfortunes. The Nobility of
<hi>Theſſaly</hi> marched after, and in their order the Deputies of the Cities, afterwards
an infinite number of people.</p>
               <p>Of the ſpoiles there was only the armes of the <hi>Scythian</hi> King that entred into
the Temple, to be left there, and conſecrated to the goddeſſe <hi>Thetis,</hi> the reſt
paſſed on. All the traine entred, and after the ſacrifices were made, <hi>Melintus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his cloake Royall borne upon one ſide by <hi>Eurymedon,</hi> on the other by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamede,</hi>
and <hi>Ariana</hi> having hers carried by the Princeſſes <hi>Paſithea</hi> and <hi>Epicharis,</hi>
they were ſet in a conſpicuous place, where kneeling down upon cuſhions, they
were crowned by <hi>Arimin</hi> repreſenting the Emperor, and by the King <hi>Archelaus.</hi>
Then the chiefe Prieſt maried them, and inſtantly all the people fell a ſhowting,
<hi>Long live the King Melintus, and the Queene Ariana:</hi> Let their reigne be happy to
themſelves and us. Theſe ceremonies being finiſh'd, they went out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and there was nothing but the accident hapned to <hi>Hermocrates</hi> and <hi>Euphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyne</hi>
that a little temper'd thoſe contentments, for they were found dead for joy
at the foot of an Altar, and embrac'd one of another; nevertheleſſe being judged
very happy, they thought it envious againſt their repoſe, to have ſhed ſo much
as a teare for them.</p>
               <p>All the City ecchoed with ſongs of joy: the feaſts that had bin prepar'd for
this Royall aſſembly, were accompanied with Muſicke of all ſorts of voices and
inſtruments. But nothing was more acceptable to theſe two noble lovers, than
the night, which gave an happy concluſion to ſo many joyes. When their ſenſes
were aſleepe with pleaſure, their ſpirits at their turne taſted ſo many delights,
that this ſweet tranſport had made them abandon their bodies, if without them
they could have bin able to conſerve thoſe divine raptures: but for feare ſome
diſunion might happen, they held one another ſo ſtreightly embraced, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the next dayes Ceremony could have ſeparate them.</p>
               <p>It was <hi>Paſithea's</hi> and <hi>Eurymedons</hi> day, whoſe love felt no leſſe impatiency, nor
was the accompliſhment of their deſires followed with meaner pleaſures. The
day following, <hi>Palamede</hi> with <hi>Epicharis, Lepantus</hi> with <hi>Cyllenia,</hi> and <hi>Amyntas</hi> with
<hi>Erycine,</hi> having obſerv'd the ſame ceremonies, taſted equall contentments; and
after that <hi>Arimin, Archelaus,</hi> and ſome others that would retire were departed
with a thouſand embraces, and many preſents, <hi>Melintus</hi> began to give order for
the ſafety of his kingdome, by fortifying of his ports, and frontiers: and having
eſtabliſhed his government with ſweetneſſe, he peaceably enjoyed the reſt of
his dayes with his deare <hi>Ariana</hi> the delicious fields of <hi>Theſſaly:</hi> as if the gods
had deſtin'd to the faireſt and moſt vertuous perſons of the world, the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
places of the earth.</p>
