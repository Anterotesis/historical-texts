         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DEar Children, and Chosen vessels of the Eternal Everliving God, whom he hath plucked as brands out of the fire, and hath Manifested his heavenly powerfull operating Spirit, to lead you in his holy fear, to wait upon him in the way of his Judgements, which hath buryed and baptized Self in the death: that you could not find any Comfort or Satisfaction unto your hungry thirsty Soules, but in lying down, in true subjection to the Iudgements of the Lord, manifest in the light, until the Lord broke in upon you [when your wills were subjected] with his tender love and bowels of free mercy, which caused the dead to live, the lame to walk, the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak forth the wonders of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Oh you dear Companions, in the tribulations, and patience of Jesus, when I remember you, my heart is broken, and as a man overcome, with the Compassions of the Lords love that flows out towards you; in which my Soul exhorteth you to dread the Lord, and fear continually before the heavenly Majesty of our God, and be faithfull upon your watch that the Enemy which you know goes abroad as a roaring Lion to devour you, that he may be trampled upon, and never get Entrance, to stain your pure garments: which you know never could be washed but in the bloud of the Lamb: And all take heed of giving way in the least measure, to what you know would intangle you in any bondage, do not rely upon your own strength, though you have and do reign in the glorious dominion standing in the Light, yet if there be the least hearkning to the Enemy to tamper with him, though you may think you may be able to subject the disposition of nature he works upon, if he draw you from the Light you will be insnared, and distress and sorrow will come upon you

                  <p>Therefore, dear Children, of the Immortal birth, I cannot but say once more unto you, Watch, watch with all circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and diligence, stand faithfull upon your watch, that in the Light of the Lord the eye of discerning be kept open in you, that you may discern the Mysterious workings of the subtil Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of your soules peace: And take heed of taking any liberty to your selves in any thing but what you know stands approved in the Light, power and life, which hath so freely manifested it self in regenerating and renewing you in the spirit of your minds, let your soules continually prize the Light, and the Sinne condemning power to love it above all things, that you may stand in the Marriage-union in the power which destroyes the works of the Devil, and keeps the Soul in pure freedome to walk with the Lord, rejoycing in the daily Cross, where Self is crucified, and the Soul set free, in the pure Liberty, in the love and life of the most High, to magnifie and praise his name, in the beauty of holinesse, for ever and ever.</p>
