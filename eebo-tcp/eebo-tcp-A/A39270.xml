            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VANITY of SCOFFING. A LETTER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM most heartily sorry, not for
my own sake but your's, that any
thing from <hi>you</hi> should create me a
trouble of this nature. That a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
honourably descended of noble
and Christian Parents, solemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
at his first appearance in the World to the
service of our blessed <hi>Iesus,</hi> adorned richly with
the most excellent natural indowments, wanting
no help to nature, which an ingenuous and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
education could administer, plentifully enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the opportunities of knowing, and all the
incouragements to do whatever is truly vertuous
and noble, things acceptable to God, and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to the world; that a person so every way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49143:3"/>
as you are, should now begin to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
with pleasure thoughts bordering upon
<hi>Atheism,</hi> and give your self up to a course of life so
far unworthy of him that bears the name of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
that it makes it a flattery to call you a <hi>Man:</hi>
is, I must needs say, so great an astonishment to
me, that I can hardly believe that this Letter
which I am now writing to you, can any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
you. Yet some ill-sounding words which
with no small grief I heard from you, in the last
discourse we had together, have been so great a
disturbance to my mind ever since, that I could not
possibly give my self any rest, till I set pen to paper,
that I might contribute something, though it be
but a very little, in respect of what others out of
their greater stock of <hi>reason</hi> (I will not say of <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>)
would have done, towards the shaking off your
hasty and dangerous resolutions, and blunting the
edge of that <hi>Scoffing</hi> wit, which incourageth you to
hope for so easie a victory over the <hi>Faith</hi> of us despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Christians;</hi> but will certainly at last, if not
timely wrested from you by the charity of some of
those whom you most hate, wound your self to the
very heart. I will not beg your pardon, either
for this my so confident assertion, or for presuming
to interrupt your secure slumbers, and pleasing
dreams, with this paper. You know my <hi>Faith,</hi>
and that I think I have as good assurance of the
truths I <hi>believe,</hi> as the most conceited <hi>Philosopher</hi> of
you all thinks he hath of any conclusion grounded
on the common principles of natural <hi>reason,</hi> or his
so much magnified evidence of <hi>sense.</hi> And you ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49143:3"/>
know as well, or I wish you did, that we poor
silly <hi>Christians</hi> are taught to love most heartily even
you who most despise us, and especially that part
of you, which you seem least to know, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot love, your <hi>Soul.</hi> This invites us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay
your <hi>scorn</hi> with <hi>pity,</hi> and rather than not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to do you good, for the evil we receive at
your hands, run the hazard of being yet more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by you. But yet far more than this, the zeal
we have for those <hi>divine,</hi> and <hi>only</hi> beauties we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
I mean those sacred truths which you <hi>deride,</hi>
but we <hi>believe,</hi> and own our selves obliged to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
with all the skill we have, constrains us to
be thus importunate, though we should be sure
thereby to lose not your favour only, but even
whatsoever in <hi>this</hi> world we can think most dear
unto us. With this resolution of contemning all
your ready censures of <hi>bold, troublesome</hi> and <hi>unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly,</hi>
if not <hi>fool</hi> and <hi>knave</hi> to boot, wherewith
you have learn'd to reward the <hi>charity</hi> of those who
seek to do you good; I now lay before you my
thoughts of what you were pleased to utter in my
hearing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This,</hi> Sir, <hi>as near as I remember it, was your
language,</hi> Christians are fools, to deny themselves the
pleasures of this world, in hopes of I know not what in
a world to come. 'Tis good to make much of our selves
here, for we know not what shall be hereafter. I could
never yet meet with any man that could bring us any
certain tidings from that other world you talk of. Who
can tell us what shall become of us when we die? Why
should man be so proud, as to hope for an Heaven more
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49143:4"/>
than other creatures? It is a mere madness to deny our
selves the things which delight us, and which now we
may injoy, for the sake of that which is uncertain and
which we do not know that any man ever did or shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.
For my own part I am resolved to live here as
long as I can, and as merrily as I can, and let those fools
that dance after the pipe of a company of cheating
Priests please themselves with the fond hopes of a new
life and a Heaven after they are dead.</p>
            <p>These, <hi>Sir,</hi> as I well remember, and many
others much a-kin to these, were your expressions;
I willingly omit your many and various <hi>Oaths,</hi> the
usual <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>ornaments,</hi> and indeed the only
<hi>proofs</hi> you have of such <hi>wild</hi> discourses. I must
confess I could not have believed it, if my own ears
had not heard it, that such words as these could
have been <hi>wrested</hi> from you; how great then was
my wonder to hear them <hi>flow</hi> so freely from your
mouth, as thereby to evidence themselves to come
from the great <hi>abundance of</hi> your <hi>heart?</hi> Good God!
Is it possible that a <hi>man,</hi> and one that pretends to
be the master of all <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>reason,</hi> should so easily
and with such complacency degrade himself into a
<hi>beast,</hi> and even pride himself in being the Author
of such conceits, as, if they have any real truth in
them, must needs make him of no more worth than
the <hi>horse</hi> he rides upon? If you can think so meanly
of your self, I beseech you henceforward walk on
foot, and make not the poor dumb creature, which
by submitting himself so gently to a load, that he
could as easily throw off, and trample under foot,
seems to know you much better than you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49143:4"/>
to know your self, to feel so oft your whip and
spur. What right have you to rule him, more
than he hath to govern you, if you must both pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
alike? If you should say that you have <hi>reason,</hi>
and he hath <hi>none,</hi> I make no doubt but some of
your <hi>companions</hi> will be ready enough to tell you,
that you know that no more, than you do whether
you have an <hi>immortal Soul,</hi> or he have <hi>none:</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
you can <hi>speak</hi> and he cannot, and so have you
one priviledge more than he hath, to abuse your
tongue to your own ruine.</p>
            <p>It is not my present purpose to shape an answer
to all your <hi>questions,</hi> or resolve all your <hi>doubts:</hi> as
these would cost me more pains than I am now at
leisure to bestow upon them: so would it be a work
of little use to you, till you be better <hi>prepared</hi> to
receive it. Till that malignant and heaving hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>self-conceit</hi> be a little corrected,
your stomach will be ever boiling with <hi>disdain,</hi>
and beloh forth <hi>reproach</hi> and <hi>scorn</hi> on every thing
that goes against it: your palate will remain too
<hi>bitter,</hi> to taste the <hi>sweetness</hi> of the truths com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to you; and your brain too much <hi>intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,</hi>
and <hi>giddy,</hi> to <hi>fix</hi> on the study and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of things which call for <hi>seriousness.</hi> My present
business is to try if I can possibly administer some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
whereby that <hi>humour</hi> may be made less pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant,
and your <hi>reason</hi> set a little more at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
then may you perhaps be content to think,
that some body else besides your self may be able to
speak <hi>sence,</hi> and say something that may deserve
the consideration of him who calls himself <hi>a wit:</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49143:5"/>
This I shall hope in some measure to effect, if I can
prevail with you to read over this <hi>Letter</hi> with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and therein the <hi>weakness</hi> of your own <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings,</hi>
the <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>dangers</hi> of your ill grounded
<hi>resolutions,</hi> and in both, the <hi>unreasonableness</hi> of
your <hi>crowing</hi> over the <hi>simplicity</hi> of us <hi>Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That you may be better able to discover the piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>weakness</hi> of your <hi>reasonings,</hi> and how whilest
you labour to make us <hi>Christians</hi> seem <hi>fools</hi> you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares
argue your selves into mere <hi>brutes;</hi> have
but as much <hi>patience</hi> to read your own words from
my pen, as you expressed <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi> in ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
them with your own tongue, and it may be,
that the <hi>same</hi> things which you then thought <hi>witty</hi>
when they proceeded immediately from your own
<hi>dear</hi> self; you may now think very <hi>foolish</hi> and <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi>
when they are, though most <hi>faithfully</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to you by <hi>another.</hi> Your <hi>words</hi> I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
set down, but to make them look a little more
with the faces of <hi>arguments,</hi> and to let you see with
what <hi>art</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> you reason, I will once more
give you them, as, had we been in <hi>dispute,</hi> when
you spake them, I suppose I should have heard them
from <hi>your self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christians deny themselves the pleasures of this
world, <hi>(you mean they dare not commit all sin
with greediness)</hi> in hopes of an uncertain happiness
in a world to come: <hi>therefore,</hi> Christians are very
fools.</p>
            <p>We know not what shall be hereafter; <hi>therefore,</hi> It
is good to make much of our selves <hi>(that is, to live as
we list, and pamper up our lusts)</hi> whilest we are
here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49143:5"/>
We could never yet receive any certain tidings out of
that other world which Christians talk of; <hi>therefore,</hi>
they are fools for believing there is any such thing.</p>
            <p>None can tell what shall become of us when we die;
<hi>therefore,</hi> it is folly to live as if we expected a life to
come.</p>
            <p>Man hath no more assurance of an Heaven than
other creatures; <hi>therefore,</hi> it is pride only that makes
him hope for Heaven.</p>
            <p>All these things which Christians hope to enjoy after
death are ancertain; <hi>therefore,</hi> it is prudence to live
as long and as merrily <hi>(that is, loosely and lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously)</hi>
as we can in this world.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> do you not think you have cause
enough to <hi>clap</hi> your <hi>wings</hi> and <hi>crow</hi> over <hi>us</hi> poor
vanquished <hi>Christians?</hi> Who is able to stand before
all this mighty strength? How can we chuse but
confess we have been <hi>fools</hi> all this while, and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
bewitched into vain hopes, by the charming
voices of a company of crafty <hi>Priests,</hi> and fall
down and embrace the feet of <hi>you</hi> our deliverers out
of this slavery? But alas, we must yet be <hi>fools</hi> still
for all this, so <hi>blind</hi> are we that we cannot see the
<hi>way</hi> that you have made us to escape; and what's
more than all, we are so much <hi>in love</hi> with our
present <hi>thraldome,</hi> that we prize it above that noble
<hi>freedom</hi> which <hi>you</hi> would make us.</p>
            <p>In good earnest, <hi>Sir,</hi> If we be <hi>certain,</hi> as we
think we are, of all those things whereof you would
make us to <hi>doubt,</hi> I dare say you will pronounce <hi>us</hi>
in a much better condition than your <hi>selves</hi> can ever
hope to be, till you become such <hi>fools</hi> as we are:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49143:6"/>
And if we can have no <hi>certainty</hi> of them as you <hi>say,</hi>
and I am willing at this time for your sake to <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</hi>
then both <hi>you</hi> and <hi>we</hi> must remain <hi>uncertain</hi>
still, and who hath made the <hi>wisest</hi> choice can then
only, if you say true, be determined, when this
life is at an end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wit</hi> changeth fashions, almost as oft as <hi>cloaths;</hi>
and one main <hi>strain</hi> of that <hi>wit</hi> which is now most
<hi>modish,</hi> is with shameless <hi>impudence,</hi> and in <hi>bluntest</hi>
terms, to <hi>declaim</hi> against those things as idle <hi>dreams</hi>
and lying <hi>fables,</hi> which all the world hath hitherto
received as the most undoubted <hi>truths:</hi> Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
now seem <hi>witty</hi> to themselves, till they have
pronounced all <hi>fools</hi> that were <hi>before</hi> them. To
say, as much without all <hi>proof,</hi> as <hi>patience</hi> of being
contradicted, tha the <hi>Prophet is a fool,</hi> and <hi>the
Spiritual man is mad,</hi> and none so great a <hi>fool</hi> as he
who told us so long ago, that, <hi>the fool hath said in
his heart there is no God,</hi> this is <hi>wit.</hi> I do not envy
the men who think it so, and use it, that great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
they hereby gain amongst such as had rather
lose an <hi>Heaven,</hi> than live <hi>soberly:</hi> but I much pity
the weakness of the men of this age, who rather
chuse to venture their whole <hi>happiness</hi> in imitation
of their <hi>vices,</hi> than provide for their own <hi>safety</hi> by
examining their <hi>dictates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>bravery</hi> of such men is to set their faces
against the Heavens, and bid defiance to <hi>him</hi> that
made them: and lest the world become so wise as
to taunt them with the Proverb,—<hi>None so bold
as blind Bayard;</hi> they are resolved to teach it if
they can to believe blindly what themselves cannot
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49143:6"/>
believe, that <hi>there is no God, no Heaven, no Hell,
no life after death, no Soul to be saved or damned, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
punishment nor reward to be expected in a future
world.</hi> Now if any man may be so unmannerly as
to require some <hi>proof</hi> of all this, some <hi>probable</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
at least why he should believe things so repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the common opinions of the world; they
will <hi>swear</hi> it stoutly, <hi>swagger</hi> it out bravely, call
all men <hi>fools, talk</hi> all, <hi>hear</hi> nothing, <hi>scrible some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
ask <hi>questions,</hi> propound some <hi>possibilities;</hi>
and when this is done, and some <hi>Satyrical</hi> strains
of wit, to close all, lavished out on those, who
dare <hi>believe</hi> the things which these men are most
<hi>afraid</hi> of; if we will calmly stand like tame fools
to <hi>their</hi> verdict, we must all turn <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures:</hi>
but if any of <hi>us</hi> poor credulous fools, have
yet so much courage left us, as not to be <hi>jeared</hi> and
<hi>Hector'd,</hi> not to be <hi>scar'd</hi> out of all our wits at once
with this uncouth noise, nor affrighted out of our
<hi>old Faith</hi> with some dazling <hi>flashes</hi> of this new-fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
wit, and a <hi>thunder-clap</hi> of oaths in the rear
thereof; if we shall yet be so stubborn and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
refractory as to persist in disputation, and so
unreasonable as once more to call for any farther
<hi>satisfaction</hi> in a thing so <hi>heterodoxly</hi> yet so <hi>magisteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
asserted; we shall usually see these <hi>tall</hi> gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
if they can find no fair opportunity of quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the company, and running away, begin to
<hi>stoop</hi> by little and little, even so long till the <hi>bravado</hi>
dwindle into a bare—<hi>It may be so,</hi> and yet <hi>possibly
it may be thus,</hi> and <hi>no man can tell us whether it be
thus or so.</hi> So that whatever conquest they obtain
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49143:7"/>
(if ever they prove masters of the field) must be
wholly attributed to the <hi>weakness</hi> of their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
nothing to their own <hi>valour</hi> and <hi>prowesse.</hi> To
deal clearly with you, after all that I have had to
this day the opportunity to hear or read from any
of these <hi>great wits,</hi> who are so greedy of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to trample upon the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> yet as
impatient, as the <hi>Devil</hi> himself would be, though
they deserve it much more, to be called <hi>Atheists;</hi>
I could never see any thing offered as a <hi>conclusion,</hi>
which would amount to any more than one of your
<hi>Sceptical premises:</hi> and were these all (with a
thousand more as good as they) laid together with
all the <hi>art</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> whereof you and your part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
have good store, how little strength they
would have to secure you from as much <hi>folly</hi> as you
charge upon others, or defend the most tolerable of
your <hi>desperate</hi> resolutions from the just imputation
of <hi>madness,</hi> requires no great skill in another to
teach you, nor sagacity in you to learn (would you
be at leisure from your vanities, and have patience
to consider) without a teacher.</p>
            <p>Who <hi>knows</hi> (say <hi>you</hi>) whether there be an <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
and a <hi>life to come</hi> or no? Suppose now that this
your question were altogether unanswerable, and
be it as true as you would have it, that <hi>no man knows</hi>
this: Yet are you far from having gain'd all that
which you catch at, such a victory over the poor
<hi>Christian,</hi> that you may without the just censure of
<hi>vanity</hi> crow upon your beloved dunghill of <hi>unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi>
For if none know this, then none knows
whether you or he hold the <hi>truer,</hi> though it will be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49143:7"/>
easily seen anon which of you holds the <hi>safer</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If the <hi>Christian</hi> think there is a <hi>life to come,</hi>
and yet there shall be <hi>no</hi> such thing, then indeed <hi>he</hi>
is in an error, and his hopes are <hi>vain;</hi> and yet I
dare not say <hi>foolish,</hi> because an <hi>eternal happy</hi> life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death is a thing so <hi>desirable</hi> of all, that every
man would be willing to lay hold on any <hi>grounds</hi>
whereon he might build any though but the <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
hope and expectation of it. It you think there
is <hi>no</hi> life to come, and yet there <hi>be</hi> one, then are
you in an <hi>error,</hi> by so much the more <hi>dangerous,</hi>
by how much your <hi>loss</hi> will prove greater, <hi>he</hi> losing
only some <hi>temporal</hi> joys, but <hi>you eternal;</hi> and yet
much more <hi>foolish,</hi> inasmuch as you both <hi>despised</hi>
what confessedly was in it self above all things <hi>desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi>
and <hi>rashly</hi> exposed your self to those <hi>torments</hi>
which are of all things most <hi>formidable.</hi> If then no
man yet know whether there shall be any such
thing or not, then as no man can yet say which of
you is in the <hi>error,</hi> so certainly the <hi>folly</hi> must fall to
your lot, who make <hi>him</hi> the But of your <hi>scorn,</hi>
who, for ought that either you, or any man else
upon your supposition can yet tell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>may be</hi> as <hi>wise,</hi>
yea, and <hi>is</hi> probably even in his <hi>choice,</hi> certainly in
his <hi>modest</hi> behaviour, much <hi>wiser</hi> than your self.
But yet, <hi>good Sir,</hi> if you and your confederates
have authority to play the <hi>fools</hi> part, and yet be
thought the <hi>wisest</hi> on the Stage, shew us whence
you have it, and we have done.</p>
            <p>Again, you say, <hi>Who knows it?</hi> This is your
way, you are <hi>ready</hi> at posing, but as <hi>slow</hi> as others
in answering: and indeed this is your <hi>master-piece,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49143:8"/>
and you know whose character the <hi>Proverbial</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hath made it, <hi>One fool can ask more questions
than twenty wise men can answer.</hi> But suppose that
in answer to your question we should affirm that
<hi>we know it,</hi> or at least that it <hi>may</hi> be known: what
we should thus affirm whether <hi>truly</hi> or no, you
could never be able to disprove: if you say and
<hi>swear</hi> we know it not, that is only to <hi>contradict</hi> not
<hi>confute</hi> us; and the world hath seen no more for it
as yet, but only <hi>your</hi> word and <hi>ours.</hi> If <hi>neither</hi> of
us as yet have so much command over men's Faith,
as to be <hi>credited</hi> in a matter of so great consequence,
upon our bare <hi>assirmation</hi> or <hi>negation,</hi> then are we
yet on <hi>even</hi> ground, and <hi>you</hi> have no more cause of
triumph over <hi>us,</hi> then <hi>we</hi> have over <hi>you.</hi> If <hi>either</hi>
may be credited on his word, why <hi>one</hi> and not <hi>both?</hi>
If <hi>both,</hi> much good may it do you: It cannot be in
the <hi>contradiction,</hi> but with respect to the <hi>divided</hi>
parties: We say, <hi>we know it,</hi> and are believed;
you say, <hi>you know it not,</hi> and are believed. Say
we both <hi>true?</hi> then are <hi>we</hi> knowing and <hi>you</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
Say we both <hi>falsey?</hi> then are <hi>you</hi> alike guilty
with <hi>us</hi> in cousening the world by a <hi>lie:</hi> and <hi>your</hi>
lie is the more <hi>pernicious,</hi> by how much greater the
<hi>good</hi> is out of which you cousen it. Say <hi>we truly,</hi>
and <hi>you falsly?</hi> I need not tell you what follows:
But if <hi>we</hi> say <hi>falsly</hi> and <hi>you truly,</hi> you have only this
advantage, that you are <hi>ignorant,</hi> and we are <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:</hi>
both equally to be <hi>pitied</hi> by others, but
neither have cause of <hi>glorying</hi> over the other. Yet
without doubt, <hi>you</hi> must be the <hi>only</hi> men who have
searched into <hi>Nature's</hi> mysteries, and have been
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49143:8"/>
fitted by the advantages of Education to discover
the knaveries of <hi>jugling Priests,</hi> and the follies of a
<hi>deluded</hi> people: If your <hi>word</hi> may be taken for it,
thus you shall be esteemed: but if your great <hi>boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
of your selves, will amount to no more but a
piece of <hi>arrogance</hi> too well known to be essential to
men of <hi>your</hi> complexion, <hi>you</hi> must still go a begging
as well as <hi>we</hi> fools for Faith to believe you.</p>
            <p>Suppose it yet once more to be as you say, that
<hi>no</hi> man knows any thing of all this, yet as this will
afford <hi>you</hi> no ground of glorying over <hi>others</hi> simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
so neither will the unreasonable <hi>inferences</hi>
you fetch thence, when throughly examined,
prove either <hi>acceptable</hi> to the <hi>considering</hi> part of the
world, or so much as <hi>safe</hi> or <hi>honourable</hi> to your
selves: I shall shew you the <hi>former</hi> of these <hi>now,</hi> and
the <hi>later</hi> in the <hi>close</hi> of this <hi>Letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You tell us, that seeing these things cannot be
known, <hi>It is most reasonable that men should please
themselves in a free enjoyment of all things they esteem
good in this world, and so make to themselves as much
happiness as they can here, seeing that happiness which
men expect after death in another world is, for ought
we know, no better than a dream.</hi> I dare not doubt,
but whilest you talk at this rate, you think you
say <hi>that</hi> for which the world is bound to return you
many <hi>thanks,</hi> and our <hi>Churches</hi> will now be soon
emptied to fill the <hi>Tavern</hi> and the <hi>Alehouse,</hi> and the
jugling <hi>Priests</hi> be forced either to <hi>starve,</hi> or <hi>stand</hi>
to your <hi>courtesie</hi> whether they shall be entertain'd
at your doors with a hard <hi>crust</hi> or a harder <hi>cudgel.</hi>
But be not angry, <hi>I beseech you,</hi> if I be bold to tell
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49143:9"/>
you, that if <hi>these</hi> be your thoughts, you flatter
your self too much, and may possibly stay as long
for <hi>thanks</hi> from men that can <hi>consider</hi> what they do,
as you would make the poor <hi>Priests</hi> you so freely
abuse, stand for an <hi>alms</hi> at <hi>your</hi> gates.</p>
            <p>They who rightly understand the <hi>meaning</hi> of
your words, and have so much <hi>wit</hi> as to think on
any thing <hi>beyond</hi> their present lusts, would hardly
be perswaded to think any thing, save that <hi>Hell</hi>
which you <hi>deny</hi> more <hi>dreadful,</hi> than that <hi>other</hi> Hell
which this your wild inference, if once generally
assented to, would make upon <hi>Earth.</hi> Nay, I
dare say, that could you win all men to be of the
same mind, of which you at present seem to be,
<hi>your self</hi> would be the <hi>first</hi> that would begin to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict</hi>
your self, and be ready to cut your <hi>own</hi>
throat, to be revenged on your <hi>rashness</hi> in teaching
men this <hi>mad</hi> lesson. Suppose that every <hi>Prince</hi>
should bring his <hi>Subjects,</hi> every <hi>Lord</hi> his <hi>Tenants,</hi>
every <hi>Father</hi> his <hi>Children,</hi> and every <hi>Master</hi> his
<hi>Servants, first</hi> to be of this <hi>opinion,</hi> that nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
either to be <hi>feared</hi> or <hi>hoped</hi> for after <hi>death;</hi>
and that they should <hi>next</hi> from this opinion take up
the same <hi>resolution,</hi> to <hi>live</hi> as they <hi>list,</hi> and enjoy
their <hi>pleasure</hi> without all <hi>check</hi> of conscience: I
am very confident, that if the <hi>Subjects</hi> should take
<hi>arms</hi> to redeem their <hi>liberty,</hi> the <hi>Tenant</hi> keep <hi>back</hi>
his <hi>rent,</hi> and not <hi>own</hi> his <hi>Landlord, Children</hi> deny
<hi>obedience</hi> to their <hi>Parents,</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> refuse to
<hi>labour</hi> for their <hi>Masters,</hi> those very <hi>same</hi> persons
who first unadvisedly put this dangerous <hi>fancy</hi> into
their heads, would rather work all means to have
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49143:9"/>
those <hi>heads</hi> taken off from their shoulders, than it
should continue any longer <hi>there.</hi> How <hi>unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
a thing is it then in <hi>you,</hi> to triumph in <hi>derision</hi>
over the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> which you cannot but
confess is the <hi>main</hi> buttress that upholds your own
best beloved <hi>interests:</hi> when, should this your
<hi>darling</hi> humour, on which you now most <hi>blindly</hi>
dote, as much bewitch your <hi>inferiors,</hi> as it hath
done your <hi>selves,</hi> it would at <hi>once</hi> make havock of
your <hi>estates</hi> and <hi>honours,</hi> and force you to do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for your follies in <hi>sackcloth</hi> and <hi>ashes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can you yet hug your selves in your <hi>licentious</hi>
thoughts, and dream that <hi>wise</hi> men will <hi>admire</hi> and
magnifie your <hi>wit?</hi> Though most men do indeed
express too great a <hi>fondness</hi> for their <hi>liberty,</hi> yet I
dare say a very <hi>few</hi> would be content to enjoy it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those <hi>terms</hi> as you do promise it. Most men do
dread the effects of <hi>libertinism</hi> and <hi>licentiousness,</hi> no
less than they love the <hi>causes</hi> that produce them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they understand the <hi>evils</hi> they are pregnant
with; and therefore although too many <hi>ears</hi> be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
set too wide open to your <hi>Syren</hi> notes, yet is
it a thing incredible, that they should be so unwise,
when their <hi>eyes</hi> are opened too to see the <hi>rocks</hi> and
<hi>whirlpools</hi> into the midst of which this ravishing
musick would invite them, as wilfully to run upon
their own destruction. Would it not, think you,
be a very <hi>pleasing</hi> thing for men to live in perpetual
<hi>feuds, tumults</hi> and <hi>confusions?</hi> What a gallant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
would it be to the poor husbandman,
when he durst not go to <hi>plough</hi> without his <hi>guard,</hi>
lest the next that comes should take away his oxen;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49143:10"/>
nor could cast the <hi>seed</hi> into the furrows, without
very reasonable fears, that another should reap the
<hi>crop:</hi> when he builds an <hi>house</hi> to think that his
next neighbour will set it on fire, or thrust him out
of his possession: and when he is laid down to <hi>rest,</hi>
not to dare to shut his eyes, lest his <hi>wife</hi> or <hi>child</hi>
should cut his throat? If all the fears of <hi>Hell</hi> and
<hi>endless</hi> torments, which <hi>Religion</hi> possesseth men
withall, are found <hi>weak</hi> enough to keep them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bounds of <hi>honesty</hi> and <hi>good-neighbourhood;</hi>
then I must be bold to tell you Sir, and all wise men
will easily believe me, that the reins of <hi>religion</hi>
once <hi>cut</hi> in pieces by your <hi>Sophistry,</hi> and nothing
after <hi>this</hi> life left for men to <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>long</hi> for; all the
<hi>laws</hi> of man will be as easily broken, as <hi>Sampson</hi>'s
Withs; the <hi>Magistrates</hi> authority will be set at
nought, and the greatest power you can imagine
in the <hi>civil sword</hi> will prove too weak to secure the
publick <hi>peace;</hi> or restrain the <hi>libertine</hi> from those
<hi>outrages</hi> and <hi>extravagances,</hi> which would render
<hi>death</hi> a thousand times more eligible than <hi>life.</hi> This
is a thing too apparently the consequence of your
doctrine: for who are the men, I pray you, that
dare despise the <hi>gibbet</hi> and the <hi>halter</hi> for any <hi>petty</hi>
prey, but those whom you have <hi>taught,</hi> or else
have been <hi>before-hand</hi> with you, in believing, that
as well their <hi>misery</hi> as their <hi>happiness</hi> shall end
<hi>there?</hi> But <hi>your selves</hi> know very well the truth of
what I now say, and are too ready to make ill use
of it, to our present <hi>disturbance</hi> and your own fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>misery.</hi> You can tell us when you list, that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
hath the greatest power to keep the World in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49143:10"/>
               <hi>awe</hi> and <hi>order;</hi> but then you would perswade us to
believe withall, that it is no more but a <hi>politick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi>
which <hi>necessity</hi> set the wit of man on work
to find out for that purpose: I am not now to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
any of your assertions, being resolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
you to your own eyes with all the <hi>advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
you can desire; you will find, when you can
but once allow your selves the <hi>liberty</hi> to <hi>consider</hi>
things, that you stand in need of <hi>more</hi> than <hi>all,</hi> to
win you the approbation even of your own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For supposing this, that you would have;
are not <hi>you</hi> the only <hi>politick</hi> wise men of the world,
and do not <hi>we</hi> all owe you abundant thanks, for
thus opening a wide gap to all <hi>confusion</hi> and <hi>disorder,</hi>
and your own <hi>ruine</hi> amongst the rest of mankind;
whilest you endeavour to pull down that <hi>fence</hi>
which you confess was <hi>wisely</hi> made, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>great</hi> cause, to secure the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> of
the world?</p>
            <p>If all this be not yet enough to let you see how
much you <hi>befool</hi> your selves whilest you <hi>deride</hi> our
<hi>Faith,</hi> and call your selves <hi>wise</hi> for living as you <hi>list</hi>:
consider but this <hi>one</hi> thing more; how you must
needs hereby deprive your selves of that <hi>only</hi> thing,
besides your <hi>wit,</hi> wherein you seem to <hi>glory;</hi> I
mean, the <hi>honour</hi> of being <hi>Loyal</hi> to your <hi>Prince:</hi>
It is most evident, that you thus betray your selves
to be the <hi>worst</hi> of subjects, and the most <hi>dangerous</hi> of
all that plead for Toleration in a <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
I confess indeed, there is a <hi>sort</hi> of people that would
be thought the only men to whom the name of
<hi>Saints</hi> is due, and, under a pretence of <hi>zeal</hi> and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49143:11"/>
               <hi>conscience,</hi> have made bold to <hi>murder Kings</hi> and <hi>fire
Kingdoms:</hi> And possibly I shall not much mistake,
if I say, that the world is beholden to the notorious
<hi>hypocrisie</hi> of these <hi>zelots,</hi> for very much of that
<hi>Atheism</hi> under which it now groans. <hi>Men,</hi> apt to
<hi>consider</hi> so little as <hi>you</hi> are, and not <hi>able</hi> or else <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing</hi>
to see their own <hi>faces</hi> in these men, hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>masks;</hi> on which <hi>something</hi> is drawn resembling
<hi>ours;</hi> are ready enough to conclude that we shall
not dare to <hi>disown</hi> them; aud that all who have a
<hi>real zeal</hi> for the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> are either as <hi>blind</hi>
or <hi>hypocritical</hi> as <hi>they.</hi> But, <hi>good Sir,</hi> I beseech
you, know, that we are bold enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
both <hi>them</hi> and <hi>you</hi> to be dangerous <hi>enemies</hi>
no less to <hi>State</hi> than <hi>Church:</hi> as their <hi>zeal</hi> is only a
<hi>disguise</hi> and <hi>trick,</hi> to pass on <hi>undiscovered</hi> to their
designed <hi>villanies;</hi> so your <hi>open defiance</hi> to all <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and profession to seek your own <hi>pleasure</hi> in all
things, makes us <hi>more</hi> than suspect, that your <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi>
or <hi>lust</hi> shall at any time take <hi>place</hi> with you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Countrey.</hi> What confidence can
your <hi>Prince</hi> have of your <hi>Loyalty,</hi> farther than he
shall be pleased to <hi>tolerate</hi> your <hi>vanities,</hi> or you
please to do him the <hi>favour,</hi> to call him <hi>Soveraign?</hi>
Whatever <hi>obedience</hi> you yield unto him, he must
thank you for it as a <hi>courtesie,</hi> but must not claim it
as a <hi>duty.</hi> It is clear as the noon-day's Sun, that
so long as you fear nothing in <hi>another</hi> world, and
thereupon resolve to gratifie your humour whilest
you live in <hi>this,</hi> you need not run to the <hi>Pope</hi>'s uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
power, nor the <hi>Sectarie</hi>'s blind zeal; for a
<hi>dispensation</hi> to turn <hi>rebel;</hi> your own <hi>pleasure,</hi> or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49143:11"/>
your <hi>profit,</hi> or any thing else you can esteem a part
of your earthly <hi>happiness,</hi> or which can court your
<hi>humour,</hi> can make all <hi>despensations</hi> to do mischief
<hi>needless.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet still are you <hi>angry,</hi> because we will not call
our selves <hi>fools</hi> for believing that our <hi>Souls</hi> are <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
and that they shall not <hi>vanish</hi> into <hi>aire,</hi> or
<hi>nothing</hi> when we <hi>die:</hi> and why? because <hi>forsooth</hi>
we cannot <hi>know</hi> it, and all is still no more but
<hi>Faith.</hi> 'Tis true the things we do <hi>believe,</hi> are
things <hi>unseen,</hi> neither can <hi>sense</hi> or common <hi>reason</hi>
assure us of the truth of those things which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
shall be <hi>hereafter.</hi> And yet it is no less true,
that <hi>neither</hi> of these can enable <hi>you</hi> to prove our
<hi>Faith</hi> absurd. Nay, were you but half so much
the <hi>masters</hi> of <hi>reason</hi> as you would have us think,
that very <hi>reason</hi> would assure you that our <hi>Faith</hi> is
<hi>reasonable,</hi> and your <hi>opinions fanciful:</hi> and that we
have much <hi>more</hi> cause to <hi>pity</hi> your <hi>folly,</hi> whilest we
can truly say your <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> courses are
all built upon an <hi>unreasonable fancy;</hi> than you can
have to <hi>laugh</hi> at us, because our <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi>
lives are grounded, as you suppose, upon an
<hi>uncertain Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For let our <hi>Faith</hi> be <hi>certain</hi> or <hi>uncertain,</hi> you must
needs confess it very <hi>serviceable</hi> to the world: it
doth much <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>hurt</hi> it can do <hi>none.</hi> But
your <hi>opinions</hi> be they <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false,</hi> are so far from
any possibility of producing the least <hi>good</hi> effect,
that they cannot chuse but be the parents of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
<hi>mischiefs.</hi> Some of you indeed have been
so rash as to affirm, That <hi>religion</hi> hath been the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49143:12"/>
cause of all the <hi>Wars</hi> which have disturbed the
world: with so <hi>impotent</hi> an eagerness of mind are
you wont to <hi>declaim</hi> against what you do not <hi>love,</hi>
that you can regard neither <hi>truth</hi> nor <hi>modesty</hi> in
those <hi>affected</hi> heats. I will again confess unto you,
that <hi>some</hi> religions have been the cause of many
<hi>wars,</hi> but the true <hi>Christian</hi> religion of <hi>none:</hi> and
though it be most true that even the <hi>Christian Faith</hi>
hath been the <hi>subject</hi> of very hot disputes, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
divisions, and most bloudy wars; yet he that
shall call it the <hi>cause</hi> of any of these, shall only there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
bewray his <hi>malice</hi> or his <hi>ignorance,</hi> in imputing
<hi>that</hi> to the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> which is imputable on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
either to the <hi>hatred</hi> of its <hi>enemies,</hi> or the <hi>errors,
imperfections</hi> and <hi>hypocrisies</hi> of its <hi>professors;</hi> and
always either to the <hi>want</hi> or too <hi>weak measure</hi> of it,
He that reads the <hi>Histories</hi> of all ages, he that hath
any insight into the <hi>Cabals</hi> and <hi>mysteries</hi> of States,
he that understands the <hi>rules</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> hath left
us, cannot chuse but see that most of these evils do
clearly spring from the <hi>ambition, discontent</hi> and <hi>wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness</hi>
of men not truly <hi>Christian:</hi> that punctilio's
of <hi>honour, priviledge</hi> and worldy <hi>interest</hi> kindle
those <hi>fires</hi> which consume our <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>quiet:</hi> yea,
he that is half blind may see that those very <hi>wars</hi>
which have been managed with a <hi>pretence</hi> to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
zeal,</hi> have come from the <hi>same</hi> forementioned
fountains; and that <hi>religion</hi> hath only been made
a <hi>cloak</hi> shamefully <hi>abused</hi> to cover most <hi>irreligious</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
and actions. For if the <hi>Faith</hi> we profess bind
us to nothing more than <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>love;</hi> and so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
prohibit all <hi>self-seeking, malice</hi> and revenge,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49143:12"/>
that it commands us upon penalty of <hi>losing,</hi> all we
<hi>hope</hi> for, and <hi>suffering</hi> all we can <hi>fear</hi> in another
world, to <hi>deny our selves,</hi> and <hi>love our enemies,</hi> and
<hi>bear the cross</hi> with patience, to return <hi>blessing</hi> for
<hi>cursing,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> for <hi>evil;</hi> who sees not, that the
world is made miserable not by the multitude of
those who <hi>sincerely</hi> profess the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> but
because so <hi>few</hi> do yet <hi>imbrace</hi> it, and so <hi>many</hi> of
those who in <hi>shew</hi> only and for some <hi>secular</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
make profession of it, are <hi>indeed</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> such
as <hi>you</hi> are. Shew me a <hi>rebel,</hi> shew me an <hi>oppressor,</hi>
shew me a factious and seditious <hi>zelot,</hi> in a word,
shew me the man that <hi>wittingly</hi> and <hi>willingly</hi> offers
the least <hi>injury</hi> to his <hi>neighbour;</hi> let him <hi>preach</hi> and
<hi>pray,</hi> yea, let him wear, for fashions-sake, all the
<hi>faces</hi> and <hi>formalities</hi> of <hi>religion;</hi> I will be bold to
return him to <hi>you</hi> again, for none of <hi>ours,</hi> and prove
to <hi>his</hi> face and <hi>yours,</hi> that <hi>he</hi> had never any more to
do, than <hi>you</hi> have, with the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> that
is, to <hi>dishonour</hi> and <hi>blaspheme</hi> it, and <hi>give occasion</hi> to
unconsidering men to talk unreasonably of things
they <hi>will</hi> not understand.</p>
            <p>But yet our <hi>folly,</hi> say you, is most apparent, for
we pretend unto a <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which you
think, it is <hi>impossible</hi> for any man to have: But
stay Sir, our <hi>folly</hi> is not yet so <hi>evident</hi> as you would
have it. Such a <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> your selves I
doubt not will be ready enough to grant in some
cases, as may make it very reasonable for you to
<hi>acquiesce</hi> therein, and not interrupt the <hi>satisfaction</hi>
which you thence receive by any farther <hi>disputation</hi>
or <hi>doubt.</hi> Should any of us be so unmannerly as to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49143:13"/>
call you <hi>fool,</hi> because you do <hi>believe</hi> you are no
<hi>bastard,</hi> nay, because you do not doubt but you
were born of a <hi>woman;</hi> and give you this <hi>reason</hi> for
it, that you rest content with a <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi>
which none can have; would you not be angry?
I have sometime heard a man of your <hi>own</hi> temper,
when he was in his <hi>gibing</hi> mood, and had a mind
to recreate himself and his companions with such
wild <hi>friskings</hi> of his playsome <hi>wit,</hi> call all men <hi>fools</hi>
that durst say they <hi>knew</hi> there is any such thing as
that we call a <hi>world:</hi> thus when <hi>wit</hi> begins to <hi>rave</hi>
it knows not when to make an end: and that <hi>you</hi>
may seem <hi>wise,</hi> not only the <hi>Christian,</hi> but <hi>all</hi> men
whatsoever must be content, sometimes at least, to
be thought <hi>fools;</hi> and the <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>sense</hi> no more
regarded than <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Faith:</hi> but when this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was asked, whether he <hi>knew</hi> he had an <hi>estate</hi>
in this world, and if he did not <hi>believe</hi> that man
should do him wrong, that should thrust him out of
his possession; or pretend a right to share with him
in his <hi>inheritance?</hi> he came a little to himself, and
was content to be a <hi>fool</hi> for company; he <hi>swore</hi> it
stoutly that he would not so <hi>tamely</hi> part with his
<hi>estate</hi> here, as we <hi>Christians</hi> in some cases are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to do, and that he would send any such bold
intruder to seek a portion in that <hi>other</hi> world which
<hi>we expect:</hi> Yet was this Gentleman more beholden
to the <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> than <hi>Sense</hi> for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his <hi>right; sense</hi> could only inform him that
a House and Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was there <hi>visible,</hi> and now
in his <hi>possession;</hi> but <hi>other</hi> evidences creating <hi>Faith,</hi>
were the <hi>only</hi> things could make him a satisfactory
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49143:13"/>
               <hi>assurance</hi> of his <hi>rightful</hi> title to them. It is so clear
that a man may have so great an <hi>assurance</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> as
may free him from <hi>doubting,</hi> and beget a chearful
<hi>acquiescence</hi> and <hi>confidence;</hi> that we have no <hi>other
assurance</hi> of any thing done before we were brought
forth, or in those parts of the world which we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
saw: whereof yet we conclude our selves so
<hi>certain,</hi> that we would hiss at the man that should
<hi>deny</hi> them. It is not therefore yet <hi>apparent</hi> that we
are <hi>fools,</hi> because we pretend to a <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi>
or if it <hi>be,</hi> we shall be sure to find company amongst
<hi>you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will yet grant you this your desired <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi>
also; suppose we then, that no such <hi>certainty</hi>
as we pretend to, can be had: but suppose withall
that your <hi>opinion</hi> have as little of <hi>probability,</hi> as our
<hi>Faith</hi> hath of <hi>certainty;</hi> the advantage is not yet so
great, but that if <hi>we</hi> must be thought foolishly <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,
you</hi> must also be esteem'd as foolishly <hi>opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native.</hi>
When you have set your wits on tenters,
to prove the things that we believe to have <hi>no</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
you are still fain to come off with a mere <hi>possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi>
that they <hi>may</hi> not be. We will not be so
unreasonable as you are, to demand of <hi>you</hi> as you
ridiculously do of <hi>us,</hi> any thing like Mathematical
<hi>demonstrations</hi> for your opinion of <hi>no</hi> God, <hi>no</hi> Soul,
<hi>no</hi> future life, and the like; but we think it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
that you should shew us some at least <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi>
reasons for your opinion, if you will have it
pass for an <hi>opinion,</hi> that is, for something <hi>rational,</hi>
and not rather for a mere <hi>dotage:</hi> and yet such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
shew you none, nor ever can do: your <hi>opinion</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:49143:14"/>
is therefore <hi>groundless</hi> and <hi>vain.</hi> Now on the other
hand, we upon all occasions produce our <hi>motives</hi> of
<hi>credibility,</hi> and such <hi>grounds</hi> of <hi>believing,</hi> as all
men able to exercise their reason, do account suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
to build a <hi>Faith</hi> upon, because all that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of this nature are <hi>capable</hi> of: and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<hi>more,</hi> only declares <hi>his ignorance,</hi> and is as
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bsurd as he that will not own there be any <hi>colours</hi>
because he <hi>hears</hi> them not, or <hi>sounds,</hi> because he
<hi>sees</hi> them not. Yet do we offer you more than you
can justly demand; for what we have <hi>reason</hi>
enough upon the true <hi>motives</hi> of credibility only,
to <hi>believe,</hi> we have undeniably so much assistance
both from <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>reason,</hi> as to render them high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>probable,</hi> even in the judgment of the <hi>considering
unbeliever.</hi> Now if it be thus, as you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
find, when you shall have patience to peruse
seriously the many things which are written to this
purpose; then certainly is the folly yet <hi>yours,</hi> who
out of a <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>groundless opinion,</hi> of the truth
whereof you can give no <hi>probable</hi> account, go on
to deride our <hi>Faith</hi> of things, both <hi>credible</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;</hi>
and on no other account but this, that still
you suppose it <hi>possible</hi> that we may be <hi>deceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, but <hi>this</hi> is our <hi>folly,</hi> that we <hi>believe</hi> things
<hi>incredible:</hi> and so you say we do; because we do
believe such things to <hi>be,</hi> as far exceed the <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension</hi>
of any mans understanding: when you have
said <hi>this,</hi> you have said <hi>all;</hi> and we must either
<hi>now</hi> be fools or <hi>never.</hi> But say, I pray', Is it a
thing so <hi>incredible,</hi> that there should be <hi>something</hi>
that we poor mortals are not able by our reason to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49143:14"/>
               <hi>comprehend?</hi> You say, indeed it is only <hi>pride</hi> which
makes men <hi>hope</hi> for <hi>Heaven;</hi> the vanity of which
expression it were as <hi>easie</hi> for <hi>me</hi> to shew, as <hi>you</hi>
would find it <hi>hard</hi> to prove, that it is only <hi>pride</hi>
which makes men <hi>humble:</hi> but I am not now to
disprove your bold sayings, but reprove your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
arrogance: I shall only therefore return
you this, which I think no man will say stands in
need of a proof; that it is <hi>pride</hi> alone can make <hi>men</hi>
think, that what their reason doth not <hi>comprehend,</hi>
is <hi>not.</hi> I shall need to do no more, but wish you
seriously to advise with your own <hi>Philosophy,</hi> to
discover this piece of your folly to you. There you
will easily learn, without my help, that <hi>incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility</hi>
by our <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>reason,</hi> is so far from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any colourable proof that the thing to which
it is supposed to belong is <hi>not;</hi> that even the <hi>minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test</hi>
things considerable in nature have depths un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
by either. Nay, it hath been often
shewn you (and let me now beg this favour of you,
when you next take our <hi>books</hi> into your hands, not
to resolve before-hand to <hi>laugh</hi> at what should make
you <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>modest</hi>) that whilest you are studying
how to charge our Faith with soul <hi>absurdities;</hi>
you plunge your selves, sometimes into the very
<hi>same,</hi> and oft into <hi>those</hi> which confessedly on all
hands are much <hi>fouler.</hi> I shall therefore leave with
you this reasonable request, that you will only so
long <hi>forbear</hi> to censure our <hi>Faith</hi> as <hi>absurd,</hi> till you
can free your selves from those <hi>absurdities</hi> which
you are forced inevitably to run into by <hi>contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49143:15"/>
All that I have hitherto said, tends only to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
you, to be so <hi>just</hi> to <hi>mankind,</hi> as to think it
possible <hi>some</hi> of them may be <hi>wiser</hi> and <hi>know</hi> more
than <hi>your selves:</hi> or if this will not down with your
proud stomachs, to imagine, (at least for a time)
that you may possibly be as <hi>foolish</hi> as the <hi>wisest</hi> of
those who are <hi>not</hi> of <hi>your</hi> opinion; till you have
weighed well what they can plead for themselves.
If we <hi>all</hi> erre, <hi>pity</hi> the <hi>frailty</hi> of our common <hi>huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
and deride <hi>us</hi> not for those <hi>infirmities</hi> which
are incident, or may be, to <hi>your selves.</hi> Give us
leave whilest we <hi>erre</hi> both so <hi>innocently</hi> and so <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially</hi>
to <hi>you,</hi> to <hi>erre</hi> also <hi>peaceably.</hi> If there be <hi>no
life</hi> after <hi>this</hi> to be expected; yet give <hi>us</hi> leave at
least to make to our selves the same benefit of <hi>this</hi>
now present, as <hi>you</hi> desire to do: <hi>that is,</hi> to <hi>please</hi>
our selves as much in the comfort of our innocent
<hi>hopes,</hi> as you <hi>delight</hi> your selves in your wicked <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments.</hi>
Certainly, when you consider it well,
<hi>our error</hi> (if it be one) will appear to be <hi>your</hi> no
inconsiderable <hi>advantage;</hi> that <hi>Faith</hi> of ours which
you make your <hi>sport,</hi> makes you a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>fruition</hi> of your desires. 'Tis <hi>this</hi> that keeps
us from <hi>envying</hi> your <hi>honours,</hi> from <hi>breaking in</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your <hi>inclosures,</hi> from <hi>disturbing</hi> your <hi>pleasures</hi>
any <hi>other</hi> way, <hi>than</hi> by our charitable <hi>admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
wherein our design is, not to <hi>abridge</hi> you in
any part of <hi>this</hi> worlds <hi>happiness,</hi> but to <hi>invite</hi> you
to share with us (if it be possible) in the <hi>glories</hi> of
the <hi>next.</hi> If I mistake not now; howsoever <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
and <hi>foolish we</hi> may seem to be for our <hi>selves;</hi>
yet this <hi>our folly,</hi> on this one account, that it seeks
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49143:15"/>
               <hi>your good</hi> no less than <hi>our own,</hi> deserves your <hi>thanks,</hi>
not your <hi>censure</hi> and <hi>derision;</hi> our present <hi>madness</hi>
more befriending you than your own <hi>wisdom;</hi> and
surely our good <hi>wishes</hi> for your <hi>future</hi> happiness,
can do you as little <hi>hurt,</hi> as you imagine our <hi>hopes</hi>
can do <hi>good</hi> unto our selves.</p>
            <p>You have already, in part, seen how much you
are your own <hi>enemies,</hi> in <hi>abusing</hi> your <hi>well-wishers;</hi>
and yet how much more disadvantagious to your
selves, are both your <hi>opinions</hi> and your <hi>practices;</hi>
how little either of <hi>honour</hi> or real <hi>satisfaction</hi> you
shall ever be able to reap from them, if <hi>true;</hi> and
what horrid <hi>miseries</hi> they will certainly bring upon
you, if <hi>false;</hi> I am now to tell you.</p>
            <p>Doth it become a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> so great a <hi>master</hi>
of <hi>reason</hi> as you are, to profess a <hi>willingness</hi> to sit
down and take up your <hi>rest</hi> in the midst of your
<hi>doubts;</hi> and settle in your self a firm <hi>resolution</hi> of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to <hi>that</hi> opinion which is so <hi>generally</hi> explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
without any farther <hi>search</hi> or <hi>examination?</hi>
Were the <hi>matters,</hi> of which we now speak, <hi>trivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
and <hi>light;</hi> such as those unprofitable <hi>niceties,</hi>
which are the sole business of too many curious
<hi>wits;</hi> and which, be they <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false, known</hi> or
<hi>unknown,</hi> are of <hi>equal</hi> concernment, that is, of <hi>none</hi>
at all to mankind; I should not blame but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
your <hi>indifferency:</hi> but then the vain <hi>curiosity</hi>
and indefatigable <hi>pains</hi> of these men in their inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
into mere <hi>trifles</hi> and things of <hi>little</hi> or <hi>no</hi> use,
doth condemn your sloth and <hi>negligence</hi> in searching
no farther into <hi>these</hi> things, which you must needs
grant of be of <hi>universal</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> concernment.

This then is all the <hi>honour</hi> that you are like to gain
hereby; that the considering world looks upon
<hi>you,</hi> not as upon great <hi>wits;</hi> but rather as on a
company of poor <hi>baffled</hi> fools; men of <hi>low, soft</hi> and
<hi>effeminate</hi> spirits; who, rather than indure to be
at any more <hi>pains,</hi> have chosen to sit down and <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish</hi>
in prepetual <hi>despair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These, Sir, are the <hi>honourable</hi> thoughts which
<hi>wise</hi> men have of you; and now see if you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
this loss of reputation, by any real <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi>
you can find to your selves in this your
desperate course. You know not, <hi>you say,</hi> what
<hi>shall be</hi> hereafter, and yet your <hi>choice</hi> is to live <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly</hi>
now. What interpretation can this admit of;
but that you are resolved to do violence to your <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
and strive with the variety of your vanities to
confound your <hi>consciences,</hi> and stifle your <hi>fears?</hi>
This is right <hi>childrens</hi> play; you shut your eyes,
lest you should <hi>see</hi> what you are <hi>afraid</hi> of; and
would perswade your selves that so long as <hi>you</hi> see
<hi>no body, no body</hi> sees <hi>you.</hi> As <hi>they,</hi> when they are
terrified by their nurses with stories of <hi>Spirits,</hi> wrap
themselves over head and ears in their bed-clothes,
and then fancy themselves safe enough: or as I
have heard of some condemned malefactors, who
drank themselves <hi>drunk</hi> when they went toward
the gallows, that they might not be <hi>sensible</hi> of their
sufferings; thus wisely do you <hi>sooth</hi> your selves up
in your ungrounded conceits, and <hi>swill</hi> your selves
in all carnal jollities, to free your selves from the

confess you do not certainly <hi>know,</hi> that there is <hi>no
Heaven, no Hell, no future life of retribution.</hi> If
you do not <hi>certainly know</hi> that these things are <hi>not,</hi>
then must you needs admit of some <hi>doubts,</hi> whether
they <hi>be</hi> or <hi>no;</hi> and grant that, for ought you <hi>know</hi>
to the contrary, they <hi>may be.</hi> Now doth not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reason</hi> instruct all men in matters <hi>doubtful,</hi> and
yet very <hi>weighty,</hi> to be <hi>cantious,</hi> to study their
own <hi>safety</hi> all they can, and to make choice of <hi>that</hi>
wherein appeareth <hi>least</hi> of <hi>danger? Fears</hi> and <hi>doubts</hi>
may indeed make some fools <hi>desperate,</hi> but they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
make wise men <hi>wary;</hi> and he that knows not
what will be, will yet in common prudence, <hi>first</hi>
diligently use all means of <hi>informing</hi> himself, and
where he cannot <hi>remove</hi> his <hi>ignorance,</hi> he will wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
labour to <hi>improve</hi> his <hi>doubts</hi> into a provident <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast</hi>
against all <hi>evils</hi> which he can imagine <hi>possible.</hi>
Where the event is <hi>dubious,</hi> it ill becomes a <hi>wise</hi>
man to <hi>rush</hi> forward at all adventures, or resolutely
to <hi>pitch</hi> upon that course which (if there be a <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and a <hi>worse</hi>) will undoubtedly lead him into that
he hath most cause to <hi>fear.</hi> Where then, I <hi>beseech
you,</hi> is that great <hi>wisdom</hi> you boast of? For if it
shall so fall out, that these things at length appear
to be as the <hi>Christian</hi> believes, and <hi>you</hi> know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the contrary, but <hi>so</hi> they <hi>shall</hi> be; then
must you needs confess you have foolishly <hi>chosen</hi>
your own <hi>destruction;</hi> and <hi>he</hi> whom you now call
<hi>fool,</hi> will be found at last the only <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>happy</hi>
man. How, think you, will you then <hi>curse</hi> your.
own <hi>folly,</hi> and wish ten thousand times to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
you had been so <hi>wise</hi> in time as <hi>to consider your
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49143:17"/>
latter end;</hi> and that you had embraced this warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which now I give you, to provide against
that <hi>evil day,</hi> which as yet you suppose only <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible?</hi>
But if it so fall out, that <hi>we</hi> at length appear
to be <hi>deceived,</hi> and <hi>none</hi> of these things follow
which we expect; when the <hi>end</hi> shall come, we
are assured, that <hi>our</hi> condition can be no <hi>worse</hi> than
<hi>your's.</hi> If after <hi>death</hi> be <hi>nothing,</hi> and <hi>death</hi> it self
(be it what it will be) be common to us <hi>all,</hi> and
make no difference of persons; if <hi>we</hi> that <hi>believe,</hi>
and <hi>you</hi> that <hi>believe not,</hi> must die <hi>alike,</hi> and rot to
dirt like <hi>beasts that perish;</hi> then, as <hi>you</hi> shall neither
feel the <hi>loss</hi> of your pleasures <hi>past,</hi> nor retain any
longer <hi>relish</hi> of them: so, neither shall <hi>we</hi> be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the <hi>frustration</hi> of our <hi>hopes,</hi> nor be troubled
with <hi>remorse</hi> for our past <hi>follies</hi> and <hi>sufferings:</hi>
where all <hi>sense</hi> ceases, neither <hi>joy</hi> nor <hi>sorrow</hi> can find
place.</p>
            <p>Yet still, <hi>say you,</hi> why should we so patiently
dismiss the <hi>comforts</hi> of this <hi>present</hi> life, which is all
we can be <hi>sure</hi> of, in <hi>uncertain</hi> hopes of those <hi>future</hi>
good things, whereof we have no <hi>assurance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here indeed you point out unto us the very
source and spring of all your Atheism: for, were
your hearts laid open, I doubt not, but we should
soon find, that it was not any <hi>strength</hi> of <hi>reason</hi> that
prevailed upon you to dislike our <hi>Faith;</hi> but that
<hi>opposition</hi> which it now makes against your <hi>darling
lusts.</hi> 'Tis only your <hi>unwillingness</hi> to forsake the
present <hi>sweets</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> that makes you set so light by
the future <hi>joys</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> These have gain'd so
complete a <hi>conquest</hi> over your <hi>affections,</hi> that they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49143:17"/>
will not afford you leave to <hi>think</hi> upon ought <hi>else.</hi>
And because you now and then, whether you will
or no, feel your selves <hi>surprized,</hi> and your <hi>pleasures</hi>
interrupted, by the stealing in of some or other of
those <hi>unwelcome</hi> thoughts, which you strive all you
can to keep out; you set your wits on work to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
all the <hi>arts</hi> of stupifying <hi>conscience,</hi> and blinding
<hi>reason,</hi> that it may not see so <hi>far</hi> off, as <hi>Heaven</hi> or
<hi>Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>self-denial,</hi> that height of <hi>temperance</hi> and
<hi>sobriety,</hi> that chearful bearing of the <hi>Gross,</hi> and
constant <hi>diligence</hi> and <hi>unweariedness</hi> in <hi>holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
that <hi>unconcernedness</hi> for the <hi>world,</hi> and patient
<hi>suffering</hi> of all <hi>evil,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> calls for in all his
followers, and which we <hi>Christians</hi> believe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<hi>way</hi> to eternal <hi>happiness,</hi> are the great <hi>bug-bears</hi>
that <hi>affright</hi> your poor <hi>dastardly</hi> and <hi>childish</hi> Souls
from that <hi>Faith,</hi> we glory in. You can now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
nothing in <hi>Christianity</hi> but <hi>grim</hi> and <hi>grisly</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>melancholy</hi> and <hi>dejected</hi> countenances; and we
<hi>Christians</hi> appear in your eyes as so many <hi>walking
things</hi> in <hi>Church-yards,</hi> and who can expect you
<hi>towards</hi> should dare to come <hi>near</hi> us?</p>
            <p>Where, all this while, are those <hi>brave spirits,</hi>
that <hi>noble courage</hi> and <hi>greatness of Soul,</hi> you are wont
to boast of? Have we despised <hi>Christians</hi> rob'd
you of them all? Or meant you rather <hi>no more</hi> by
all your <hi>brags,</hi> but only to <hi>set off</hi> that <hi>fool-hardiness</hi>
and desperate height of all <hi>madness,</hi> in daring so
boldly to venture on the <hi>foulest</hi> vices, to rank your
selves with <hi>Beasts</hi> and <hi>Devils,</hi> and now and then to
shed a little of your rank <hi>bloud</hi> in a <hi>duel,</hi> to adde a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49143:18"/>
farther <hi>grace</hi> yet to the <hi>borrowed</hi> beauties of those
whorish faces which you so much Idolize? How
would an <hi>old Heathen,</hi> were he now alive, laugh
you out of this <hi>new Philosophy,</hi> and that goodly
title of <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> which you shamefully abuse to
commend your <hi>follies</hi> to the world.</p>
            <p>I am a little <hi>angry,</hi> I confess, when I call to mind
your abominable <hi>wickedness;</hi> but yet, I will assure
you, no <hi>pity</hi> is wanting in me to your <hi>persons,</hi> nor
<hi>charity</hi> to lend you what assistance I am able to help
you out of those foul <hi>ditches</hi> into which your
wretched <hi>mistakes</hi> have thrown you.</p>
            <p>Know then, I beseech you, that though the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verites</hi>
of a <hi>Christian</hi> life were a thousand times <hi>more</hi>
than indeed they are, yet are they just <hi>nothing,</hi>
when compared with those <hi>comforts,</hi> which that
<hi>hope</hi> you deride, doth abundantly administer unto
us. Experience shews us, how that many real and
very great <hi>difficulties,</hi> which men <hi>unaccustomed</hi> to
such encounters, or not <hi>animated</hi> with the like <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires</hi>
and <hi>hopes,</hi> are apt to look upon as <hi>insuperable,</hi>
and esteem him <hi>mad</hi> that would expose himself unto
them; seem yet <hi>easie</hi> unto those men, whose eyes
and <hi>affections</hi> are all the while they struggle <hi>through</hi>
them, fixed upon some thing <hi>beyond</hi> them, which
they <hi>prize</hi> above all things, and have conceived
some hope of attaining to, even though their <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
of <hi>success</hi> be as little as you now suppose ours
to be. It is no news to hear of a <hi>Merchant,</hi> whose
either love to <hi>wealth,</hi> or more <hi>honest</hi> desires of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
his <hi>countreys needs,</hi> makes him <hi>freely</hi> venture
his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>livelihood</hi> at once in a weak Vessel to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49143:18"/>
the <hi>merciless</hi> winds and waves, all in hope of an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain</hi>
booty: and not to trouble you with more
<hi>instances</hi> in a matter so obvious to the eyes of all
men; <hi>you</hi> know, how <hi>some</hi> amongst your <hi>selves,</hi>
in the courtship of an <hi>uncertain</hi> honour, or what's
<hi>worse,</hi> a proud <hi>unconstant</hi> woman, wade with
much foolish <hi>patience</hi> through those <hi>slavish</hi> and <hi>deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
drudgeries, which are no less destructive to
your <hi>reputation,</hi> than repugnant to your <hi>humours;</hi>
'tis visible enough, that for the <hi>uncertain hope</hi> of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
your beloved vanities, you are willing to
want your present <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>quiet;</hi> and so far to deny
your selves, as to make it a <hi>courtesie</hi> in him that
will call you <hi>men.</hi> Shall it now be thought a <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi>
thing in you thus <hi>poorly</hi> to degrade your
selves, through <hi>ambition, avarice</hi> and <hi>luxury:</hi> and
must it be esteem'd a <hi>folly</hi> in men, whose aims are
no lower than <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Eternal</hi> glory, with a
chearful <hi>valour</hi> to encounter a few more <hi>tolerable</hi>
hardships; which are so far from having any thing
of <hi>baseness</hi> in them, that they have ever been justly
accounted (even by men of <hi>meaner</hi> hopes the most
renowned <hi>Heathen</hi>) the best <hi>trials</hi> and <hi>exercises</hi> of
<hi>brave</hi> and <hi>generous</hi> spirits?</p>
            <p>For tell me, what are those <hi>dreadful</hi> things unto
which the <hi>Christian's</hi> love of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> doth
expose him? Have not some old <hi>Heathens,</hi> who
have thereby won unto themselves the Epithets of
<hi>gallent, great</hi> and <hi>vertuous,</hi> even for a <hi>name</hi> writ
upon a <hi>stone</hi> in <hi>golden</hi> letters, most chearfully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
the <hi>same?</hi> Are not there <hi>books,</hi> yet in the
hands of every School-boy, full of grave lessons of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49143:19"/>
               <hi>justice, temperance, sobriety</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> and such
other <hi>vertues</hi> as we are bound to <hi>practice,</hi> and they
thought to be the only things fit to keep <hi>men</hi> up
above the rank of <hi>bruits?</hi> Have not they taught
us, that <hi>contempt</hi> of <hi>pleasures,</hi> and all the <hi>fading
glories</hi> of the world, is the <hi>mark</hi> of a <hi>brave</hi> Soul?
That <hi>poverty,</hi> and <hi>banishment,</hi> and <hi>death</hi> it self are
<hi>nothing</hi> unto a truly <hi>noble</hi> spirit, whose <hi>character</hi> it
is, to love <hi>vertue</hi> for it <hi>self,</hi> and admire it <hi>most,</hi>
when <hi>stript</hi> of all those <hi>outward</hi> ornaments, which
commend it only unto <hi>those</hi> that know not how to
judge of things by their own native worth? Have
not many of them left us <hi>examples</hi> of sacrificing our
<hi>ease</hi> and <hi>life</hi> to the common <hi>good</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> of our
<hi>Country?</hi> Shall we <hi>admire</hi> and <hi>praise</hi> these
things when we read them from the <hi>pens,</hi> and see
them in the <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>deaths</hi> of sober <hi>Heathens,</hi> and
yet <hi>condemn</hi> them as <hi>absurd</hi> when commended to
us by the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Christians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet, alas, all these things which so affright
and trouble you, are far from being <hi>such</hi> as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
Had you but the <hi>courage</hi> once to <hi>taste</hi> the
<hi>sweetness</hi> of a <hi>Christian's</hi> life, you would presently
confess your past <hi>fears</hi> as <hi>causeless,</hi> as now your
<hi>censures</hi> are <hi>unreasonable,</hi> in <hi>condemning</hi> before all
<hi>trial.</hi> This is that great <hi>injustice</hi> which we <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
are wont to meet with at <hi>your</hi> hands; you are
wedded to your <hi>lusts,</hi> and your <hi>sins</hi> have <hi>bribed</hi> you,
and before a full <hi>hearing,</hi> you pass <hi>sentence,</hi> and
<hi>condemn</hi> the things you most <hi>unreasonably hate,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you do not <hi>know</hi> them, nor will have <hi>patience</hi>
to <hi>examine</hi> and <hi>try</hi> them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:49143:19"/>
We do not, by our <hi>Faith,</hi> abridge our selves in
any <hi>honest</hi> comfort or delight: our <hi>self-denial,</hi> when
rightly understood, will appear to be the only true
<hi>self-love.</hi> We <hi>abstain</hi> from that only which we think
will do us <hi>hurt,</hi> and if we seem to part too freely
with any thing is <hi>good,</hi> 'tis only when we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that the <hi>keeping it</hi> would prove our <hi>loss,</hi> by
hindring us from the enjoyment of a <hi>better.</hi> We
think it prudence to take heed that we <hi>surfeit</hi> not
on what is <hi>sweetest;</hi> and that we be not <hi>poison'd</hi>
whilest we too freely indulge our <hi>palates.</hi> We are
not taught to cast our <hi>goods</hi> into the <hi>Sea,</hi> save when
so to do appears the only way to save our <hi>selves</hi> from
being <hi>drowned.</hi> Our <hi>self-denial</hi> then is not that <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose</hi>
thing you fancy it to be, but as <hi>sweet</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> as
<hi>you</hi> can think it <hi>bitter:</hi> whilest our <hi>meanest</hi> fortunes
are <hi>sweetned</hi> unto us with the <hi>pleasures</hi> of a <hi>contented
mind;</hi> and the greatest <hi>loss</hi> that can now befall us,
can never fall <hi>heavy</hi> on us, who live in continual
expectation of a future <hi>recompence,</hi> and have learn'd
to <hi>value</hi> things according to their <hi>worth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, Sir, we are allowed whatsoever is <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
to our <hi>nature,</hi> and most conducing to a <hi>healthful</hi>
and a <hi>comfortable</hi> life. We have never been instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to expose our selves to <hi>unnecessary</hi> evils or suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but with all <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>honourable</hi> caution, to
prevent them: and when the <hi>Cross</hi> is laid in our
way, not to baulk it through <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>cowardice,</hi>
neither to step aside into the paths of <hi>wickedness</hi> to
avoid it; but <hi>manfully</hi> to take it up, and bear it after
our <hi>General,</hi> who as he hath encouraged us by his
own <hi>example,</hi> and the glorious <hi>reward</hi> he hath set
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49143:20"/>
before us, so also doth he give us present <hi>strength</hi>
enough for such a burden. Consider, I beseech you,
how 'tis very possible, that all those things which
you count certain <hi>comforts,</hi> and therefore think us
fools in denying them unto our selves, may yet be <hi>no</hi>
such <hi>comforts</hi> unto <hi>us,</hi> as they seem to <hi>you:</hi> and also
that those things which you call certain <hi>evils;</hi> and
we, in your opinion, do foolishly undergo; may yet
appear <hi>no evils</hi> unto <hi>us,</hi> or far <hi>less</hi> than they do to
<hi>you:</hi> we may possibly therefore much more freely
part with the <hi>former,</hi> and with much more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
suffer the <hi>later,</hi> and be no such <hi>fools</hi> in either,
as <hi>you</hi> suppose; seeing you have much different
thoughts of these things from <hi>those</hi> which <hi>we</hi> have
of them. Yea whilest we willingly let pass unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
many present <hi>pleasing</hi> and <hi>profitable</hi> things,
and as chearfully undergo things <hi>unpleasant</hi> and
<hi>hurtful,</hi> for <hi>uncertain</hi> things to come in a future <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain</hi>
life, as you suppose; you mightily mistake,
if you think it so great a grievance to <hi>us,</hi> whose <hi>faith</hi>
and <hi>hope</hi> are as <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>high,</hi> as <hi>your's</hi> are <hi>weak</hi>
and <hi>low.</hi> Nay, had we no such height of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
yet the bare <hi>confideration</hi> of but a <hi>possible,</hi>
though <hi>uncertain eternity</hi> of joy or sorrow, must
needs be enough to make a wise man for his own
<hi>safeties</hi>-sake, to chuse something less <hi>easie</hi> or <hi>comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi>
here, to <hi>secure</hi> himself for ever.</p>
            <p>These things, I know, will not easily be driven
into men of <hi>your</hi> complexion. You have already
<hi>prejudiced</hi> your palate by a too greedy feeding on
the things you <hi>love</hi> best, at <hi>first</hi> taste to relish the
<hi>sweetness</hi> I now speak of. Neither is it possible you
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49143:20"/>
should <hi>ever</hi> be sensible of it, except you can perswade
your self for some time to use <hi>abstinence,</hi> and set your
self in good earnest to make some new experiments.
Whether you will be at the cost and pains thus to
do, I know not: but I hope I may however obtain
this <hi>easie</hi> favour at your hand, not to think that all
mens <hi>palates</hi> are <hi>alike,</hi> and just of the <hi>same</hi> temper
with your <hi>own.</hi> You cannot but know the great
<hi>variety</hi> of mens <hi>gusts,</hi> and how that some men take
as much pleasure in chewing <hi>Aloes,</hi> as others do in
<hi>Sugar.</hi> The <hi>Christians</hi> temper being so widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from <hi>yours,</hi> think it not <hi>unreasonable</hi> in him to
<hi>delight</hi> in what you <hi>loath</hi> and <hi>hate:</hi> or if you will go
on to <hi>laugh</hi> at him for so doing, you must grant that
he hath the very <hi>same</hi> cause of <hi>deriding</hi> you, though
his greater <hi>charity</hi> forbid it. Nay, think it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
that, if you should a-while <hi>examine his</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and make trial of <hi>his</hi> course of life, you might
perceive a strange <hi>change</hi> in <hi>your own</hi> affections and
desires.</p>
            <p>And truly that <hi>one consideration</hi> which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
commended to you, of the <hi>safety</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
course of life, and the <hi>hazards</hi> which attend
your own, should (a man would think) prevail
upon you, to <hi>try</hi> some farther experiments, before
you <hi>die;</hi> and not run on so <hi>confidently</hi> in those ways,
which, if there be an <hi>Hell,</hi> must certainly bring you
to it. Think a little with your self, if this Letter
should have found you ready to <hi>breath</hi> out your <hi>last,</hi>
and going you know not whither; what <hi>fears</hi> and
<hi>jealousies</hi> it would possibly have stirr'd up in you;
and in the midst of what <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>distractions</hi> your
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49143:21"/>
               <hi>fearful</hi> Soul would then have expired; when you
should have look'd upon your condition as then <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate,</hi>
an <hi>eternity,</hi> for ought you know at hand;
all the <hi>time</hi> already spent which should have fitted
you for a comfortable entrance into it, and yet no
provision at all made for it. I hope this paper will
come more <hi>timely</hi> to your hand: wherein my design
is only to <hi>startle</hi> you at present out of the <hi>Scorners
chair,</hi> and from that <hi>couch</hi> of <hi>security</hi> whereon you
now <hi>dream,</hi> and I am loth to see you <hi>sleep</hi> to <hi>death.</hi>
If I may be so happy as to <hi>rouze</hi> you up a little, and
perswade you to look about you, and <hi>consider</hi> the
<hi>dangers</hi> which surround you, I shall yet hope that
this very <hi>consideration</hi> will beget <hi>caution,</hi> and <hi>that</hi>
an unwearied <hi>diligence,</hi> and a constant <hi>attendance</hi>
on the means of better discoveries: even till at last
you embrace that <hi>Faith</hi> which you have <hi>ignorantly</hi>
Scoffed at, and by it arrive at that eternal <hi>happiness,</hi>
for which you have, together with these poor <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,</hi>
