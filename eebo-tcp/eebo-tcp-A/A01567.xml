         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(right reuerend Father) in what
miserable seruitude, intollerable

griefe of conscience, the godlie
hath from time to time continued vnder the tyranny
of superstitious Popes and Prelates of Rome, whose
intollerable pride is of the Lord detested, and of all

the world hath been so long deceaued &amp; many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements

impudently to challenge to themselues the name and

treadeth his word vnder feete, despising his holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
and institutions, and as it were in despite of
his glory, follow the works of their owne imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord of his mercy and loue, sending
the light of his holy worde, for the reliefe of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted

their filthines to all flesh. Wherby it is come to passe
that many worthy personages, lately liuing in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

most earnest repentance of their former life. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

God, this worthy Prince, &amp; bishop of Collen, Gheb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,

hath most effectually showne the fruites of his vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
repentance, and hauing made declaration therof
throughout his dominions and iurisdictions, hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished
the abhominable masse, and in steed thereof
planted the euerlasting &amp; glorious Gospel of Christ,
to the great comfort of many grieued and wounded
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences. Which when the Pope perceiued, &amp; knew
with great flattery and adulation, he sought to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this most godly &amp; christian enterprise,
charging him with the othe he made to the church
Apostolique, &amp; with his duty towards God, which he
both by scripture, but specially by their owne lawes,
counsell, &amp; decrees, doth manifestly defend, &amp; by the
fame approue, that he hath done nothing against his
othe or duty in any respect: and the rather dooth he
reproue them by their owne aucthoritie, for as much
as the same is the greatest confutation that maye be
against them. And because the same was done by a

before the eternall &amp; euerliuing God,
that the same was neuer our purpose

            <p>And for this cause we will haue it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly

ought to remaine at libertie, vnto
the consent of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest of our most noble

and after our decease, to be resigned
without force. And for this cause, all

that they are not held, or bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

their true and rightfull Lord) tyll such

our Electors, the Prince which shall
succéed, be lawfullie and righfullie cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen.
And that they shall not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb facs="tcp:3100:7"/>
or take for their Prince, any that

the ordinarie and lawfull election
of our aforesayde Electors, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

béene obserued by long and auncient

heretofore made by vs, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
preposed) against this our present

we vtterly at this present, and for

in the straitest manner and forme that

vpon the same, with our aforesayde E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors
and States of our prouince, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

of this our present promise, in
such maner that no daunger, nor feare,
or other damageable enterprise maye
come or happen, for any such matter by

In witnesse whereof, we

were elected by the charter of <hi>Collen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

in such sort that it was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
stronglie withstoode, but in a maner
vanquished &amp; made vaine. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
we vsed such benignitie towards

we approued and allowed the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

and vertue of our Apostolique co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
by reason whereof we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded,
that there is none which ought

greatly displease vs, and merueilously
grieue vs, that our hope therein is not

            <p>Againe, consider your duty towards
God, which hath raised you to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
and degrée of the sea Apostolique,
which you should cherish with singuler
affection and fauour, and for the same
it is that you ought to spend your blood
in all christian profession: For by how
much the more you are of hie calling,
and honourable estate, by so much the
more is your fault greater, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
when you fall from any parte of
your duety. And by so much the more,
wil your fault be greater, as you were
of honour and dignitie, in the church of
God, and in great aucthoritie with the
Princes of the Empire. Consider then
what troubles and dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers procéedeth
from such new remoouings of thinges,
and how héedfull the prudent and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

without the aduice of others to gouern
my selfe, and by the onely will of our
Lord Iesus Christe, which hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saued
to call me to the great charge of
an Archbishop: and as it is a thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the nature of a christian man, to
inquire and followe after the trueth, I
am setled in the furtheraunce of this
good worke, without musing at all, on
any custome or humaine authority: fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by the holie scriptures, and amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
the ecclesiasticall histories, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this which
we haue commaunded to be done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
him which is the child of God:
and which is also required in the office
<pb facs="tcp:3100:12"/>
himself hath already established, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to
say, Iesus Christ, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only way,
the trueth, and the life, in whose name,
as also with the Father and the holie
Ghost we are baptised: to whome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> catholique church, hauing
redéemed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same by his precious blood.
Upon this foundation is the church su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained,
being also beautified and inri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with most excellent tytles, which
he hath giuen by S. <hi>Paule</hi> in the first to
<hi>Timothy,</hi> the third chapter: calling her
the house of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuing God, the fortitude
&amp; strength of the trueth. Then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
church which was in the time of
S. <hi>Paule,</hi> and certaine yéeres after, was
of great renoume and estimation, for
the faith they had in Iesus Christ, and
at that time taught through the whole
world: the which faith was her onelie
ornament, insomuch that the Priests &amp;
Elders of the same Romane Church,
plainly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed, writing to S. <hi>Ciprian</hi>
in his 7. epistle of his 2. booke, in these
words, That letting the honor &amp; praise
decay, which S. <hi>Paule</hi> gaue to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
was a great &amp; grieuous crime,
<pb facs="tcp:3100:12"/>
and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it had béene lesse shame, neuer to
haue had those prayses spoke of, or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
abroade, then after the publishing
thereof, to lose the honour of such high
commendations. Therfore as often as
it comes in question, to speake of the
pure, true, Apostolique, and vniuersall
church: reason requireth, and all wise
men giueth counsaile, that we ought to
discerne betwéene that, which is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon the head corner stone, Christ,
vpon the holy Gospell (the honour and
name wherof shal endure euerlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:)
and that which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bastard church,
going against the trueth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worshippeth
God in vaine, following after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements
&amp; traditions of men. And
therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rule of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> hath
euer pleased al good and vertuous men,
saying, that the first hath béen alwayes
the truth, &amp; that which came afterward
corrupted, and that is it which hindeth
mee to the othe which I haue made,
which othe dooth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund, that I must
acknowledge the sayde Apostolique
church, which holdes the ancient beléefe
of the Romane church, agréeing to the
<pb facs="tcp:3100:13"/>
beléefe of <hi>Nice,</hi> and of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
which dooth acknowledge and beléeue
one baptisme for remission of sinnes, by
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blood of our Lord Iesus Christ: which
is our onely purgatorie that cleanseth
vs of all our sinnes, which receaueth
no other traditions then this only, that
are appointed by the Apostles, leauing
&amp; deliuering faithfully, that which they
receiued from our Lord Iesus Christ.
After whose example I am bounde by
my othe, to take the holy scriptures, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
and vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the same,
not after the sence or interpretation of
any Bishop or Councell, whatsoeuer,
but after the vnderstanding and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the true, Apostolique, and holy
mother Church, that (I say) which hath
followed the steps of the holy Apostles.
Whervnto the auncient Fathers hath
from time to time consented, so that
without any blemish to the othe which
I haue made, I am addressed after this
rule, &amp; bound to this fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation, neither
will I receyue or beléeue any thing,
which is not brought from the same,
wheresoeuer it was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether at
<pb facs="tcp:3100:13"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> or at <hi>Trent,</hi> being reasonable to
prefer these auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t things with new,
the truth with falsehood, &amp; the traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
of the Apostles, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements
of men. For our lawes as it dooth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appeare in the 15. distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
third canon: doth not alowe these aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and most renoumed Councelles
the like aucthority, as they do to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Scriptures &amp; Apostles, which sayth
thus: <hi>The holy church of Rome, after
the writinges of the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
which we receiue for certaine
rules, doth not forbid but that we may
receiue the Councell of Nice, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,
Ephesus, and of Chalcedonae.</hi>
Thus haue I hytherto shewed, what
was the band and foundation of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> othe
which I lent, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which I protest,
that (by the grace of God) I will not
starte nor turne, from the true faith in
Iesus Christe, nor seperate my selfe
from the holy and Apostolique church,
to the which I do owe all reuerence, as
I wil doo all my life: in remembrance
of that which I did vowe in baptisme
to God, and promised to the Church.
<pb facs="tcp:3100:14"/>
For the rest, it is out of doubt betwéene
all good and learned men, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
we haue promised or sworne, if it
be wrong &amp; contrarie to our first faith,
receyued in baptisme, that it bindeth
vs not at all, this (I saye) is to be seene
by the rule of the right cannon Lawe,
that is to say, that an oth taken against
good and godlie workes, bindeth not:
and following the right cannon, the
othes that are made against good déeds,
drawes vs vnto sinne. Wherevpon
the Maister of Sentences hath wiselie
sayd, in the 39. Distinction after Saint
<hi>Hierome,</hi> that an othe hath three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
companiens, veritie, iudgement,
and iustice, and if any of these lacke, it
is not a true othe, but a false othe: But
<hi>Gratia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> giueth these aduertiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the déede of an oth, <hi>Euil promises</hi> (saith
he) <hi>breakes faith, chaunge therfore the
the ordinaunce of euill and dishonest
thinges, and do not that, which thou
hast vnwiselie promised, for that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
is against God, which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
with wickednesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the seuenth cannon of our lawe,
<pb facs="tcp:3100:14"/>
we haue a rule giuen, which we ought
straitlie to obserue, not onely for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of othes, but in all the actions of
our life (that is to say) that if by the sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teltie
of our craftie enimie, we are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into any faulte, we must séeke to
escape it, by that meanes which we sée
is least hurtfull and daungerous: thus
you sée, that the olde and auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hath generally concluded, that all
vndiscrete and vnlawfull othes, ought
not to be obserued and kept: and that
it is more tollerable for to breake an
othe, then to perseuere in the sinne of
fornication. The same is also learned
by the aucthority of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> that if
faith be not obserued, to the intent to
returne to the right waye, it cannot be
called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> violating of faith, for as much
that the same is not true faith, which is
requisite to commit sinne. It is easie to
shew by many learned men, and also
by the holie scriptures, and by the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Doctors, that partly the slacknes
and slouthfulnes: and partly by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnes
and malice of many Popes,
sundrie things hath crept in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romane
<pb facs="tcp:3100:15"/>
church, <hi>as Platinus</hi> (though otherwise
greatly affectionated to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Roman seat)
certifieth that those things do not agree
to the Apostolique &amp; catholique church,
but they are notably iniurious against
Iesus Christ, which is established for to
be the redéemer of peace, by the faith in
his blood, &amp; also most idolatrous, which
whosoeuer should followe of a trueth,
should sinne greeuouslie against God:
and yet as <hi>Arnobius</hi> sayeth in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
booke against the Gentiles, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
we ought to forgiue liberally and frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
though it were against the Church,
and against our owne conscience. For
these thinges then, I am not drawne
through any cause by you, (as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great &amp; woorthy personages hath
taken occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to withdraw themselues)
not from the catholique church, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the corruption &amp; abuses, which turneth
vpside downe the foundation thereof.
I wil not for this time enter into long
disputation, but I would rather come
to the crime, wherein I fell my selfe by
you most accused. I sée, I sée, or at the
least, I féele a certaine smell, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:3100:15"/>
be lesse then a sinnefull thing, the
peine whereof, craueth the losse of my
life, or of my charge and dignitie: for
the which I am accused among you,
which maketh me most odious, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the world to thinke, that I reiect
all discipline, all duety, and all honour,
but the shame thereof (falselie accusing
me) maketh your selues almoste to
blush. Which is, because I am purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to marie, which S. <hi>Paule</hi> neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
affirmeth, to be honourable amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
all men: and which is also sette in the
Romane church, among the number of
the Sacramentes. But whensoeuer I
am minded to accomplishe this thing,
what shall I doo, or enterprise against
the examples of the holy Apostles, and
their rules and decrees? What doo I
against the aduise of <hi>Clement, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian?</hi>
or against our owne Lawes, in
the <hi>.28.</hi> Distinction, the .11. and 12. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
where mention is made of the
wiues of Priests, and Deacons, being
aboundantly contained in the <hi>.17.</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
as it was decreed by the Councell
of <hi>Gangar,</hi> that, <hi>If any reiect a maried
<pb facs="tcp:3100:16"/>
Priest, being of opinion that he ought
not to offer, because he is maried, and
for that cause will not come to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
let him be accurst.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer, those words spoken with
great grauitie by <hi>Paphuntius,</hi> in the
Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended in the
second parte of their decrée, which did
not feare to call mariage the second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of chastitie. Wherefore is it then
that the aucthoritie of <hi>Siricius</hi> or <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi>
should be of greater waight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
vs, then that of the Apostles? Of
generall Counselles? Of auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
before mentioned? Or of GOD
himselfe? Which plainly pronounced,
that it was not good for man to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
What follie, or what madnesse I
praye you is it then, to endure rather
adulterers, fornicators, and Sodomiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
liuers, in the ministerie and church
of Christ, then those which hath true &amp;
lawfull wiues, following the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
of God? From what spring,
or from whose mouth came the same
doctrine, which forbiddeth and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
mariage? It appeareth by the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
<pb facs="tcp:3100:16"/>
chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> vers. 36. 37. and
the first of <hi>Timothy,</hi> the fowrth chapt.
ver. 1. 2. 3. <hi>Aeneus Silueus,</hi> in his discrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Germany,</hi> witnesseth that the
holy bishoppe <hi>Vldricus,</hi> strongly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode
the lawes of <hi>Celebat,</hi> against the
Popes of his time, writing an Epistle
vnto Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> wherin he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained that the chiefest Prelates,
and Priests (namelie of <hi>Italy,)</hi> were so
much giuen to lust and lecherie, that
they would not abstaine from deflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
maid, wife, or any other, nor spare
theyr owne kindred, but commit sinne
against nature, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> masquelin sort,
&amp; also with very brute beasts: and there
he declareth an historie worthy the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he, that did first forbid ecclesiastical
persons to marie, sending afterwarde,
certaine fishers to fishe in a mote, hard
adioyning to a Nunrie, they founde
more then six thousand childrens heads
that had béene throwne therein, which
when <hi>Gregorie</hi> sawe, and perceyued
the wicked fruit of his <hi>Celebat,</hi> sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:3100:17"/>
to heare the same, he brake that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
alledging the sentence of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
that, <hi>It is better to marie then to
burne:</hi> Adding also, that it is farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to suffer mariage, then to be the
cause of murder. The Abbot <hi>Vspergus</hi>
also in his Chronicle, maketh mention
of an epistle in the most renoumed cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of the ecclesiasticall states at <hi>Bresse
Nore,</hi> made against <hi>Heldebrand,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
among other things, was a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint
made, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he deuorsed spyrituall persons
from theyr wiues, &amp; vnder this detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Pope, the Churches were in great
daunger, &amp; also he declared y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were
not bound in any promise to the Pope,
for it is a greater thing to make a vow
to obey God, and the catholique church,
then to submitte our selues to the will
and pleasure of any Pope, whatsoeuer.
For these reasons, I that knoweth my
duetie towarde Iesus Christe, and his
Church, I am determined to take the
lawfull way and remedy, permitted to
all manner of men (without exception)
against euill and disordinate lustes, as
<pb facs="tcp:3100:17"/>
it becommeth a true bishop, and a man
of noble race to doo: to the ende, that I
may keepe my soule chaste, and arme
the same against all allurements of the
flesh. Therefore am I determined to
enter into mariage, not being mooued
by any light or disobedient minde: but
after long tryall made of my selfe, I
haue knowne that it is not good for me
to liue vnmaried. Which gifte is not
permitted to all, nor for euer, (that is
to say, to make so long a triall of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:)
I am resolued, following the
lawes of the church aboue mentioned,
to leaue that vndiscrete vow of the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebat,</hi>
which is not in my power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
estéeming that this is lawful for
me, for the auoiding of a greater euill,
and for the better obseruing &amp; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing
the vowe of chastitie, which I
made vnto Iesus Christ: and in so doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I haue framed my selfe according
to the commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of God, submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to his prouidence, and staying to
his protection, not caring what euill
men may iudge, nor for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> threatnings,
<pb facs="tcp:3100:18"/>
daungers, or any other thing whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
hauing in memorie that which
<hi>Theodorus</hi> hath written in his fourth
booke, the tenth chapter, of the auncient
Christians. Whiche dyd knowe no
greater griefe then the renouncing of
pietie: and although the tyrants went
about raging and running vpon them,
as stormes, or tempestes, yet could they
not be shaken or put backe from pietie
and godlines. Therefore, in all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
I haue recourse to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those which hath right intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and knowledge. Unto whome
I doo appeale and submit my selfe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the example of <hi>Iustinus Martyr,</hi> in
his Apolligie for the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. In this
submission most rightfull and iust, that
by those which religiously feareth God
the trueth alone is reuerenced, and to
the same, all and euerie thing must be
agréeing.</p>
            <p>Nowe I addresse my selfe to you
Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> to the ende I may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of you this my purpose, (being
most chaste and according to the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb facs="tcp:3100:18"/>
of the true and auncient Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church) some protection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
Therefore I doo earnestlie pray
and beseech you, that of the same affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which it hath pleased you to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
me, that you will take my part
in my most iust enterprise, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
that those which smothlie flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
you, (a sort of bribe takers, which
dooth but lightlie and softlie touch the
moste daungerous woundes) bee not
those that dooth most honour, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
vnto you and the Church: but
well are they, which <hi>Plutarch</hi> speakes
of, in his Trentes of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the flatterer and the friend:
which boldlie and lyberallie speaketh,
admonishing, and rebuking, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to theyr owne appetie and desire.
What am I then that should speake or
brall against the Popes? if they take
all that they say out of the word, lawes
and commaundementes of God, and
out of the writings of the Apostles and
Prophetes, vppon which doctrine, the
Church and the Popes, ought to be
<pb facs="tcp:3100:19"/>
founded and builded; by GOD which
hath the sufferaintie ouer Kinges and
Popes. Oh that it were the good will
and pleasure of him, that I might see
the daye, that you would not take the
care to oppresse me, and all other men,
louers and followers of the doctrine
and life of the Apostles: but rather
that you should earnestlie vndertake
to cast farre away from you, so many
vanities, so many idolatries, simonies,
and sacrileges, and cut off these effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,
fornicators, and adulterers,
drunkardes, and idle personnes, which
our owne lawes dooth excommunicate,
to the ende that the Romane church,
might recouer her auncient dignitie,
and that peare and tranquilitie might
come againe, among all Christians.
that many grieued and wounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
might finde rest and consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Nowe as it is commonlie sayde,
that of a poore gardener, or a simple
man, something may be heard of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
sence: so I hope that you will
not take this my small admonition, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
<pb facs="tcp:3100:19"/>
then with a fatherlie, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and equitable hart: which is made
vnto you by one of your Brothers in
Iesus Christ, and an <hi>Almayn,</hi> which
could neuer dissemble, wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
I praye God to kéepe
you in his protection.</p>
