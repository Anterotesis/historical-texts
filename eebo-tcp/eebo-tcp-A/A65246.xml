            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>By all which they hoped to have seen the end of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and removall of their feares, by the just, severe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary punishment of Delinquents, who are the causes of all these ruining perturbations, and to have been by this time setled in the enjoyment of that happy Peace they have always

desired: but deceived of this hope, they cannot omit humbly to remonstrate, that after all this vast expence, they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves but little neerer their end, if not more dangerously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, and like enough to keep those intestine Wars on foot, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> they shortly become a prey to forreign force, as late disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries give them cause to feare.</p>
            <p>And however they are very sensible of the great burthen of renued contributions, both beyond the example of former times, and their owne expectation of such supplies; yet they shall with the samelife and cheerefulnesse go on to adventure more; so as it may be employed in a more speedy and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all prosecution of the Warres, which they humbly conceive would not have beene drawne out to this length, had it not bin for giving eare to those counsells of accommodation, a proposition induced by our enemies to gain time, which if concluded, they will keep only so long as to serve their ends, but the very conclusion of it wholly incomptable, as your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants humbly conceive, with the Protestation of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to condigne punishment these grand Delinquents, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries, who have imbroyled our State, and sought to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a tyrannie, without whose counsell and influence nothing on that side can be concluded, and as also the ready way to expend and wast their remaining Treasure, and render them thereby wholly unable to defend themselves.</p>
            <p>The contemplation of their emminent danger thereby, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth them humbly to remonstrate, that if these destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive counsells of accommodation be re-assumed, they shall think it necessary to look to their own safeties, and forbeare to contribute to their own ruine; to which onely accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and not the greatest force of these enemies of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique peace can ever bring; the motion whereof your Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants beleeve, will be exploded with the greatest indignity
<pb facs="tcp:62784:3"/>
by all the good patriors of your honourable assembly, yet humbly desire you will be pleased to publish such a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion herein, as shall seem good to your Wisedomes, whereby not only the people may be assured, that men mis-affected to the publique may not serve their own ends, or drive on their particular designs in this destructive accommodation; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Ingenires of these contrivances may lye under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a just and heavy censure; if they shall yet by such dangerous and unreasonable interpellations, to bereave us of the right and wholsome use of our advantages and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; by which for the present, besides all other dangerous effects, the Delinquents and Incendiaries are incouraged with the hope of a good retreat, when they have done their utmost.</p>
            <p>The sad effects of this accommodation appearing at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, more terrible unto your Remonstrants then the present view of the worst of this unnaturall war, gives the boldnesse to them, to make this humble addresse to this most honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble assembly: withall professing that they are resolved with the utmost expense of Lives, and estates to stand by, assist, maintain, and execute all your counsells and command<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
