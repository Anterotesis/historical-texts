            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I will: the citties in that country were large, &amp; well builded, for ſtrength more then beauty, for they were moſt of ſtone, and couered with a kinde of ſlate, but many of theyr townes were decaied, their caſtles, and chief howſes, ruinated, as it ſhould ſeeme, either by ſome ciuill warres, or ſome vnciuil Enemy: for the gouernors, they wer men of further matter for theyr wit, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their aſpects, did make promiſe of: and yet they would knit the browes, look vnder the Eies, ſtroke downe their beards, nod with their heads, ſhake vp poore men; whippe Roges, Rate Beggars, empriſon offenders, hang vp theeues and in all they could, ſeeke to maintaine peace: that was one thing I cheefely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Citties: but for their courts I ſtaied ſo little a while in them, that I cannot iuſtly ſaie any thing in their commendation; and yet in the contrary I would ſaie as little, for feere I ſhoulde wrong them: But in their townes, and citties, I ſawe many things and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prettie lawes, and cuſtomes among them, which in mine opinion were not vnworthy the noting: The firſt law was, that no man ſhould marry a faire wench with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mony, except hee were rich: for fear of the horne for want of maintenance:</p>
               <p>Item that no old woman that had wealth and children ſhould marry a young beggar, for feare of waſting her childies goods, and putting her ſelfe to her patience:</p>
               <p>No man aged ſhould marry a wench too young, for feare of the curſe of contrarietyes.</p>
               <p>No man ſhould be a ſtranget to his owne howſe, for fear his wife would procue a goſſip.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4950:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
No woman ſhould be maſter of her huſband, for feare of the next neighbors riding.</p>
               <p>No man ſhould bring his horſe into a ſtable, but he ſhould pay for his meat ere he came out.</p>
               <p>No man ſhould take more then he had warrant for, leſt he ſhould anſwer it at the gallowes.</p>
               <p>No vintner ſhould mingle water with his wine, except he vvere allovved it by his Company.</p>
               <p>No Tailor ſhould put more ſtuffe in a garment, then vvas allowed him for his meſure.</p>
               <p>No ſhoemaker ſhould make his ſhoos to ſtrong, for feare they hold to long.</p>
               <p>No Tradesman ſhould ſell his ware too good cheape, for feare of hinderance to his Trade.</p>
               <p>No Ieſter ſhould bee fauoured of the wiſe, for feare of being more knaue then foole.</p>
               <p>No Conſtable ſhould be ſuffered to be drunk, for feare the vvatchmen ſhould fall aſleepe.</p>
               <p>No Fool ſhould inherit too much land, for fear a knaue ſhould to ſoone alter the property.</p>

Indeed qd. ſhe I haue heard much of the ſhepheardes &amp; their loues, but whether they be fictions or figures I know not; but giue me leaue, ſhall I leaue Lady for Miſtris, wealth for want, a court for a cottage, &amp; command for obedience, &amp; all for the hope of loue? no Miſtris, loue makes a cottage a court, where content is a kingdom, and what greater wealth then in the riches of the mind? for obedience in kindneſſe it is the worke of Loue, and to be a worthy miſtris, is better then an vnworthy Lady: and therefore let hope bee an aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the perſwaſion of loue: but who is the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Miſtris? ſhe that hath power ouer her ſelfe: and who the moſt worthy ſeruant? he whom ſuch a Miſtris hath entertained: good ſeruant hurt not thy ſelf, in doing me good; good Miſtris doe mee good in not wiſhing my hurt: If I ſhould loue, &amp; not liue with you, where is the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of your conceit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if I can liue without your loue, let no conceit content me: if I ſhold fauor you &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw my fortune, what ſhal be the reward of my folly?
<pb facs="tcp:4950:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If your vertue grace my loue, howe much ſhould my ſeruice honour you? If the world frowne on mee, who wil helpe me? If the Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s bleſſe you, who can hurt you? nowe fie vpon thee ſeruant, <hi>I</hi> knowe not what to ſay to thee: and for that there are company comming, let this in brief ſuffice thee: ſo farre as I maie, I doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thee, in honor I wil grace thee, haue patience for a time, &amp; it ſhall be happy for thee: ſor though my eſtate be not much, yet it is in mine owne diſpoſing, and my parents in the Earth, I am at the heauens direction, for my reſolution: and therefore, feare not the fruit of thy faith in the hope of my fauoure, for, I am thine, but I pray thee giue me a little leaue, to ſhake off one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more: walke by and heare vs, and when he is gon, let him goe for euer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Miſtris quoth I, your commaund is a lawe, take your pleaſure in any thinge, make mee onely happy in beeing what you will I ſhall bee; and with this woorde, taking of her a ſober ſmiling leaue, I ſtept a little aſide, and ſeeing company comming, left her to entertaine a young gallant, who a little ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping forwardes from his company, ſaluted my miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris in this manner.
