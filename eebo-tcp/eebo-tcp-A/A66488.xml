            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Waking VISION; or REALITY in a Fancy.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>AS I was walking, reading in a Book,</l>
               <l>Of all the Plots that <hi>Rome</hi> had undertook,</l>
               <l>Methought I heard a ſudden murmuring Rout,</l>
               <l>And curious to behold: I fac'd about,</l>
               <l>When ſoon the Croud did to my fight appear,</l>
               <l>With a young <hi>Hero</hi> ſtalking in the Rear.</l>
               <l>Their Leader was an Old man, known too well</l>
               <l>By that falſe Trayterous name <hi>Achitophel</hi>:</l>
               <l>He fac'd about, and waving round his Wand,</l>
               <l>The cringeing Rout ſtood ſtill upon command.</l>
               <l>Lieutenant <hi>Abſalom</hi> forſook the Rear,</l>
               <l>And ſtrutting forward, did ith' Front appear.</l>
               <l>Thus ſixt in their Array, the firſt that broke</l>
               <l>The ſilence, was <hi>Achitophel</hi>; who ſpoke</l>
               <l>With roaring voice, and viſage moſt auſtere,</l>
               <l>When to his Eccho all the Rout gave ear;</l>
               <l>All big with expectations, till the bold</l>
               <l>Snake-like <hi>Achitophel</hi> his ſtory told.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I need not tell you of the caſe betwixt ye,</l>
               <l>If you remember <hi>Forty eight,</hi> and <hi>Sixty</hi>:</l>
               <l>How happy were we in the firſt of thoſe,</l>
               <l>When no man durſt our Laws or Wills oppoſe;</l>
               <l>Wills as obliging as the <hi>Perſian</hi> Laws,</l>
               <l>We fought and proſper'd in the <hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi>:</l>
               <l>None durſt oppoſe our <hi>Faction,</hi> or appear</l>
               <l>In vindication of a <hi>Cavalier.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then all our Party in one humour ſtood,</l>
               <l>To bleed the Nation, tap the Royal Blood.</l>
               <l>Till envious Death at laſt did baſely trip</l>
               <l>Old <hi>Nol</hi> up, with his ſhort <hi>Protectorſhip.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then turn'd the Game, and <hi>Monk</hi> began to ſing</l>
               <l>In Loyal Tone, Now Boys <hi>a King, a King</hi>!</l>
               <l>Againſt our wills he did by force reſtore</l>
               <l>The <hi>King,</hi> to that which was his Right before;</l>
               <l>Then all thoſe plaguy Rogues call'd <hi>Cavaliers,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Began to peep abroad, and ſhake their Ears;</l>
               <l>Each one expecting from the <hi>King</hi> to be</l>
               <l>Rewarded for his Truth, and <hi>Loyalty.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>When thus we ſaw our <hi>Plots</hi> go down the wind,</l>
               <l>We chang'd our Note, and ſpake in other kind;</l>
               <l>And made the World believe 'twas only We</l>
               <l>Reſtor'd the <hi>King</hi> to Crown and Dignity:</l>
               <l>When if we could but ſtill have been obey'd,</l>
               <l>No <hi>Stuart</hi> e're had <hi>Englands</hi> Scepter ſway'd.</l>
               <l>But ſince what's done, cant be undone again,</l>
               <l>Why ſtand we idle gazing here in vain?</l>
               <l>Let's try our wits, and Plot for to obtain</l>
               <l>And play the <hi>Old Game</hi> over once again:</l>
               <l>Do as our Fathers did, come play your parts,</l>
               <l>And let the people know you're <hi>Engliſh</hi> hearts,</l>
               <l>That are not given to change. —</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Eighty one</hi> offers us a mark as fair,</l>
               <l>As ever <hi>Forty</hi> did: come — ſtrike — prepare,</l>
               <l>Take Oaths of Secreſie, and Covenant</l>
               <l>To eaſe the Nation of her groans and want.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Religion, Liberties</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Will make the Rout quickly eſpouſe our Cauſe:</l>
               <l>Tell 'em, if they don't ſtir they're quite undone,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Religion's,</hi> ruin'd, <hi>Liberties</hi> are gone:</l>
               <l>Perſwade 'em that the <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Train,</l>
               <l>Are juſt returning to the Land again:</l>
               <l>That's a pretence ne're fails, but always takes,</l>
               <l>And of a Bad Old Cauſe, a Good one makes.</l>
               <l>Now, now's the time; ſtrike up, for if you miſs,</l>
               <l>You'l never meet a time <hi>ſo</hi> pat as this.</l>
               <l>Here's <hi>Popiſh Plots</hi> dis;cover'd and found out,</l>
               <l>With <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies</hi> to charm the Rout;</l>
               <l>And ſoon perſwade them all their Lives are loſt,</l>
               <l>That they muſt burn like Martyrs at a Poſt,</l>
               <l>Unleſs they get the <hi>Popiſh Party</hi> quell'd,</l>
               <l>That is by <hi>Evil Counſellors</hi> upheld:</l>
               <l>Here's <hi>Grievance</hi> upon <hi>Grievance</hi>: theſe are Knaves,</l>
               <l>And thoſe would make the Free-born Subjects <hi>Slaves</hi>:</l>
               <l>Tell them the <hi>King</hi>'s a Tyrant, and Oppreſſor,</l>
               <l>And that we have a damn'd <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor</hi>:</l>
               <l>The <hi>Parliament</hi>'s diſſolv'd, and we muſt be</l>
               <l>Govern'd by <hi>Arbitrary Tyranny</hi>:</l>
               <l>But yet be ſure to keep you in the ſhade,</l>
               <l>And do whate're you do in Maſquerade.</l>
               <l>If any <hi>Senator</hi> againſt you s;it,</l>
               <l>Be ſure to call him <hi>Papiſt, Jeſuit,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Mac-Tory, Proteſtant in Maſquerade,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That would your <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> invade:</l>
               <l>Now one word more, and I have ſpoke enough,</l>
               <l>Go fall to work, for I have found you ſtuff.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Which having ſpoke, the Rout was jogging home,</l>
               <l>But ſoon return'd at voice of <hi>Abſalom</hi>;</l>
               <l>Who with audacious tone cry'd, Hark, my Friends,</l>
               <l>Come ſide with me, if you'l attain your ends;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Achitophel</hi> ſhall change and take the Rear,</l>
               <l>And I my ſelf will in the Front appear,</l>
               <l>And good old <hi>David</hi> ſoon ſhall know that I</l>
               <l>Will be his <hi>Heir,</hi> or elſe I'le bravely die.</l>
               <l>What though my Mother was his Concubine?</l>
               <l>The fault was hers, I'm ſure, it was not mine:</l>
               <l>I am his Son, and from his Loins did ſpring;</l>
               <l>I am of Royal Bloud, and will be King:</l>
               <l>Do you but help me to obtain the <hi>Crown,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I'le rule by Law, and all your Foes put down;</l>
               <l>I'le part the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Councel</hi> quite aſunder,</l>
               <l>And will redreſs the Griefs you labour under;</l>
               <l>If once I can but to the Throne attain,</l>
               <l>I'le grant <hi>New Charters,</hi> and the Old maintain.</l>
               <l>At which the Rout with hallows fill'd the Skies,</l>
               <l>And cry'd, <hi>We'l venture all for Liberties</hi>:</l>
               <l>When ſuddenly the Rout did diſappear,</l>
               <l>And all the Coaſt was in an inſtant clear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then I began to think which was the worſe,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Fanatick</hi> bleſſing, or a <hi>Popiſh</hi> curſe:</l>
               <l>I put them in two Scales to try their weight,</l>
               <l>And found the Ballance equiponderate;</l>
               <l>But holding them a while, I quickly found</l>
               <l>As this was hoiſted up, that kiſs'd the ground:</l>
               <l>Then ſuddenly I found the meaning out,</l>
               <l>This ruines quickly, but that round about:</l>
               <l>Then to my mind my thoughts began to ſing,</l>
               <l>Go haſte and what thou'ſt heard inform the King:</l>
               <l>I durſt not go, but preſently I wrote,</l>
               <l>And ſeal'd it up, and ſent the <hi>King</hi> this Note.</l>

                  <l>Your Ruine does, <hi>Sir,</hi> too too plain appear,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> leads the Van, <hi>Geneva</hi> brings the Rear.</l>
                  <l>If you'l be ſafe, you muſt expell them both,</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Roman Gnat,</hi> and the <hi>diſſenting Moth</hi>:</l>
                  <l>And vigorouſly let them underſtand,</l>
                  <l>You are their <hi>King,</hi> and will like <hi>King</hi> command.</l>
                  <l>And if you e're expect to gain your Ends,</l>
                  <l>As well as open <hi>Foes,</hi> take heed of <hi>Friends</hi>;</l>
                  <l>I mean a flatt'ring Friend, whoſe only ſhew</l>
                  <l>Makes him a Friend, but really is not ſo.</l>
                  <l>Learn by your Father, not to truſt to thoſe</l>
                  <l>That in the end will prove confiding Foes.</l>
                  <l>Conſider on't, you're in a woful ſtraight,</l>
                  <l>Think but on <hi>Forty one,</hi> and <hi>Forty eight.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>I only ſpeak this for a Precedent,</l>
                  <l>For Heav'n I hope will all ſuch things prevent.</l>
                  <l>You're now the Darling of all Loyal hearts,</l>
                  <l>And may be ſtill, if you will take their parts:</l>
                  <l>But if you bear with <hi>Faction,</hi> or with <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And do delay to give them both their doom,</l>
                  <l>All <hi>Loyal</hi> men muſt ſuffer by thoſe two,</l>
                  <l>And be in ſpight of Fate undone with You.</l>
                  <l>You muſt be ſure to ruine Both, or none;</l>
                  <l>If one remain, you're ſure to be undone:</l>
                  <l>For if you ruine <hi>Rome</hi> on equal ſcores,</l>
                  <l>You ſhut the <hi>Window,</hi> but leave ope the <hi>Doors</hi>;</l>
                  <l>Unleſs you ruine the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> too,</l>
                  <l>For know one Nation can't hold Them and You.</l>
                  <l>Thoſe men I fear againſt your Life combine,</l>
                  <l>That ſtrive to croſs you in your Good deſign;</l>
                  <l>And thoſe men ſure would yield to put you down,</l>
                  <l>That tell the People, <hi>You are not their own.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Pardon me, <hi>Sir,</hi> if I your quiet break,</l>
                  <l>For <hi>Poets</hi> dare at all Adventures ſpeak.</l>
