            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Earthquakes</hi>
improper Prologues to
usher in such a Triumph
as the <hi>Inauguration</hi> of a
King. When <hi>Balaam</hi> in
his Parable concerning <hi>Israel</hi> told <hi>Balak,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50419:3"/>
The shout of a King is amongst them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 23. 21.</note> sure
he meant not such boisterous Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as This, whose noise disturbs the
Upper Region, and affrights the Lower;
But my excuse must be the common Say,
that such Meteors as Thunder &amp; Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
usually clear a troubled Sky, and
purge an ill-condition'd Ayr.</p>
            <p>We have of late years suck'd in the
unwholsome vapours of an Air tainted
with Rebellion and Rapine, with ill
Opinions and worse Actions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
need the loudest Thunder to fright
us into our lost Duties, and cleanse our
Element grown as degenerous as our
selves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I do not mistake the words in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
them to</hi> Thunder, It is the voice of
the Lord.<note place="margin">Verse 26.</note> Haec dicit Jehovah, <hi>'Tis</hi> he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
this voice, a mighty voice, <hi>which</hi>
shakes the wilderness,<note place="margin">Psal. 29. 5, 8.</note> and breaks the Cedars
of Lebanon; <hi>which levels the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to make them equal to the Vale,
and beates the Towers, whose height

the Earth is burnt at His presence.</p>
            <p>The dying Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> was angry
with the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> when he bid
<hi>him strike with the Arrows upon the ground,</hi>

that he strook only <hi>Threetimes?</hi> had he

overthrow'n. But this Artillery which
stands mounted in my Text is sufficient
to do the work intended. After <hi>these
Three Overturns</hi> there needs no re-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the blow, nor is there any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
left for further execution. The vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Hurrican, fiercest of whirlwinds,
doth not more surely destroy all obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles

<hi>Three Overturns</hi> Remove that which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs

            </p>
            <p>I know the History properly points
at <hi>Zedekiah</hi> who was that <hi>wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane

<hi>Cidaris,</hi> being an ornament worn on the
Priests head, and (as <hi>Hieron.</hi> writes)
had the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> engraven upon it;
As also you read <hi>Wisd. 18. 24. with thy
Majesty graven upon the Diadem of his
head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet this particular of my Text is
Mystically interpreted of <hi>Christ,</hi> by
whose Copy Kings hold their Right,
<hi>All dominion being given to Him,</hi> and
from him derived upon <hi>His</hi> Vice-Gerents
here in Earth.</p>
            <p>And it may Prophetically and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Prince, who was a <hi>Type of Christ</hi>
too; whom, after a long interruption of
the Regal Line, God raised up to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build

I shall take the liberty, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

It. Yet with no purpose to refresh
the Memory either of Those Persons, or
the Mischiefs by them Acted, which the
Grace and Mercy of Him who was the
greatest sufferer would have buried in
an <hi>Act of Perpetual Oblivion;</hi> but in
thankful duty to God to commemorate
the defeat of Their late unpardonable
practices, who by Fraud <hi>Abjured,</hi> and by

            <p>
               <hi>In the first of these all Domination
was originally founded; For the Elder
Brother in his Tribe was</hi> Princeps Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liae,
<hi>the</hi> Prince of his Family. <hi>And not
only the</hi> Excellence of Dignity <hi>which was
his Birth-right, But the Inheritance is so
fastned to Him as if God intended no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
either by the Hatred or Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Parent. The Text is most
remarkable (and I wish all Parents
would lay it to heart)</hi> If a man have Two
wives,<note place="margin">Deut. 21. 15.</note> one Beloved, and another Hated, and
They have born him Children both the Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and the Hated, And if the First-born
son be her's that was Hated,<note place="margin">Vers. 16.</note> Then it
shall be when he maketh his sons to Inherit
that which he hath, That he may not make
the son of the Beloved First-born before the
son of the Hated,<note place="margin">Vers. 17.</note> which is indeed the First-born;
But he shall acknowledge the son of
the Hated for the First-born, by Giving
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50419:12"/>
him a double Portion of all that he hath; for
he is the beginning of his strength, the Right
of the First-born is his.</p>
            <p>Therefore though the Law hath been
overcurious to un-rivet this Birthright by
Gods &amp; Mans Law entail'd upon the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
bringing in Feigned Persons &amp; False
Vouchees, and Formal Proclamations to
devest it, I must only say thus much,
<hi>Sic non fuit ab initio</hi> (as <hi>Christ</hi> said of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce)

               <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 8.</note>
