            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Answ. <hi>The Arch-bishop here you se made a repetition of a lesson hee had writ out by heart (whether by the advise of his Counsell, or whether he had it from Oxford; or did stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it himself it matters not) he spake it not you see out of Conscience, which was the cause why he dirst not trust his decriped memorie;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51530:3"/>
lest his conscience should flye in his face, and put him out of his lesson.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good people,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a very uncomfortable place to preach in, and yet I shall begin with a Text of Scripture, in the twelfth of the Hebrewes,
<q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> 12.1, 2.</bibl>
                  <p>Let us runne with patience that race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was ser before him, endured the Crosse, despising the shame, and is set downe at the aight hand of the Throne of God.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>Hee saw how uncomfortable a thing it was to bee brought to publike shame, in respect of himselfe, but was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all touched in Conscience; for that Cruell Tyranny where by hee insulted over others to bring them to publique shame before, he speakes nothing, nor was at all humbled for that. And yet speakes of a place of Scripture you see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that no Text in all the whole Bible (had hee had grace) could have come neerer to his conscience, for persecuting, imprisoning, whipping, pillering, and drawing the blood of the saints of God, in that Tyrannicall manner whiche he hath done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51530:3"/>I have been long in my race, and how I have looked unto Jesus the Author and finisher of my Faith, is best known to him: I am now come to the end of my race, and here I finde the Crosse, A death of shame, but the shame must be despised, or there is no coming to the right hand of God; Jesus despised the shame for me, and God forbid but I should despise the shame for him.</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>He lived to an olde Age; and enjoyed many great blessings, had hee had grace to use them to Gods glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y) but you see hee doth not in all his speech so much as once praise God for the same: But rather stand upon his justification by Workes as you shall see by and by? Why he calls Iesus to witnesse here; and then goes on to apply his Text to himselfe; even to his very death, to Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by workes: Even triumphing over that shamefull death, in all which he speakes nothing of beleeving but all of doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am going apace, as you see, towards the Red-sea, and my feet are upon the very brinks of it, an Argument, I hope, that God is bringing me to the Land of Promise, for that was the way by which of old he led his people; But before they came to the Sea, he instituted a Passeover for them, a Lamb it was, but it was to bee eaten with very sower herbs, as in the Twelfth of <hi>Exodus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>He was then indeed as neer the Red Sea as</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh <hi>was when his Horses drew him into the deluge, as hee was pursuing the people of God, and in Iustice cut
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51530:4"/>
off, whilst he pursued them by bloody persecution. No doubt but many of those Saints, that died under his Martyrdome are in the Land of promise: And though for himself he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to make us beleeve him to be a Lambe, yet was he chiefe amongst the first borne of the Egyptians, that so Cruelly insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over the people of God, which was to be smitten before the people of God could expect to be delivered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall obey, and labour to digest the sower herbs, as well as the Lamb, and I shall remembr that it is the Lords Passeover; I shall not thinke of the herbs, nor be angry with the hands that gathered them, but look up onely to him who instituted the one, and governeth the other: For men can have no more power over me, then that which is given them from above.</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>Now he comes to Workes of superarogation to make himselfe not one Lambe, but a Lambe unspotted, and the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him to death a Passeover, nay a Passeover of Gods institution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not in love with this passage through the red Sea, for I have the weaknesse and infirmitie of flesh and blood in me, and I have prayed as my Saviour taught me, and exampled me, <hi>Vt transiret Calix ista.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this Cup of red Wine might passe away from me, but since it is not that my wil may, his will be done; and I shall most willingly drinke of this Cup as deep as he dleases, and enter into this Sea, I and passe thorugh it, in the way he shall be pleased to leade me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:51530:4"/>Answ. <hi>Hee would make himself a Lambe as Christ was, expressing himselfe in Christs very words, you see so proudly, and loftily did he carry himself in all his actions at his death, as if he was so pure a Lambe, that he would bid defiance to Heaven: To charge him with any spot, or blemish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet (Good people) it would be remembred, Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t when the Servants of God, old <hi>Israel,</hi> were in this boyst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sea, and <hi>Aron</hi> with them, the Egiptians which perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted them, and did in a maner drive them into the Sea, were drowned in the same waters, while they were in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of them: I know my God whom I serve, is as able to deliver me from this Sea of Blood, as he was to deliver the three Children from the furnace, <hi>Daniel</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>His speech is the phrase of a Potentate; (still, Good peple?) The language which Princes use when they speake to their people; scorning to call us us brethren, who had so much honour from the Pope, like the Beast which must be lifted up above his brethren. Yet I wonder what should make him dreame of a deliverance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether he looked for a Pardon or a Repreeve, from the KING: or whether he thought the parliament did but jest with him, to try what he would do, or that hee hopod for an insurrection about him, or what it should be, I am altogether Ignorant. Surely, in that condition hee was now in, it had been more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to a gratious spirit, to humble himself before God, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how he was overwhelmed with those waues; into which he had driven the people of God, and in which himselfe was now so neer drowning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51530:5"/>And I most humbly thank my Saviour for it, my reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is now, as theirs was then; their Resolution was, They would not worship the Image which the KING had set up; nor shall I the Imagination which the PEOPLE are setting up, nor will I forsake the Temple, and the Truth of GOD, to follow the bleating of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and in <hi>Bethel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>He still goes on, as if there had been some hopes of his deliverance, and set downe you see his resolutions, if he should have lived, and that full of pride, that hee would never submit to the Parliaments, and their Lawes, which he sets in oposition to the Temple and truth of God: Nay hee is so farre from Charity, that hee seemes to invite the people to mutinie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I pray God blesse all this People, and open their eyes, that they may see the right way; for if it fall out that the blinde leade the blinde, doubtlesse they will both into the ditch.</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>Are not these wicked Tares for a dying Man to sowe between the Parliament and the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my selfe, I am, (and I acknoledge it in all humillity) a most greivous sinner many wayes, by thought word and deed, and therfore I cannot doubt but that God hath mercy in store for me a poore penitent, as well as other sinnes;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:51530:5"/>Answ. <hi>This speech hath something like grace in it, when it is spoken from a sincere Coonscience; but whether this was onely a complement with God, or to blind many, or how cordiall it was spoken none can judge; and therefore I shall wave that to come to those particulars which follow, in which we shall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understand this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have, upon this sad occasion, ransack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d every corner of my heart, and yet I thanke God, I have not found any of my sins that are there, any sins now deserving death by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny known Law of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>Had he ransack'd every corner of his heart as hee here saith he did, and dealt ingeniously with us: and layd the poore fellowes blood (that he caused to be hanged, drawne and quartered to fulfill his humour) close to his Conscience; that (had there bene nothing else) would have given him the lye in this particular. But that is but one thing, there were many crimes proved against him; as to give the King a wrong oath at his Coronation, to keepe that Plot so private, which he knew of when an Indian nut had bin prepared to be given to the King with poyson; his labouring to subvert the fundamentall Lawes of the Land; his correspondency wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Why should a dying man this dissemble at his death; But then he daubs up the matter and saith:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet thereby I charge nothing upon my Iudges (I humbly beseech you I may rightly be understood, I charge
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51530:6"/>
nothing in the least degree upon my Iudges) for they are to proceed by proof, by valuable Witnesses, and in that way I or any Innocent in the world may justly be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: And I thank God, though the weight of the Sentence lye very heavie upon me, yet I am as quiet within, as (I thank Christ for it) I ever was in my life:</p>
            <p>Ans. <hi>The Witnesses are hundreds of honest godly men that came against him, some of them are honourable Members in Parliament, some of them reverend Divines, some Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and other godly honest Christians, and of as good repute as any amongst those where they live, that came to witnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him from all parts of the Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though I am not onely the first Archbishop, but the first man that ever dyed in this way, yet some of my Predecessours have gone this way, though not by this meanes: for <hi>Elfegus</hi> was hurried away and lost his head by the <hi>Danes</hi>; and <hi>Simon Sudbury</hi> in the fury of <hi>VVat Tyler</hi> and his fellowes: And long before these Saint <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> had his head danced off by a lewd woman; and Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> Archbishop of Carthage submitted his head to a persecuting Sword.</p>
            <p>Ans. <hi>The Archbishop here you see lookes upon</hi> Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist <hi>as his Predecessor, but the Archbishops case was rather like that of</hi> Thomas a Becket, <hi>or Cardinall</hi> Woolsey's, <hi>or Bishop</hi> Bonners, <hi>but his stomack will not downe, he cannot bow, no hee talkes of greatnesse, and his comfort is that he goes the way of great men. But nothing in all his speech can be more observable then this that here hee bringe in; not onely</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51530:6"/>
               <hi>a moderate Popish Father, but</hi> Elfegus <hi>a most notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Popish Priest of the</hi> Danes, <hi>and with him also</hi> Symon Sudbury <hi>another as notable a Iesuited Prelate, in King</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard <hi>the seconds dayes, and these are the men from whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample (he saith) to his great comfort he is taught patience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many examples great and good, and they teach me pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, for I hope my cause in Heaven will looke of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye then the colour that is put upon it here upon earth; and some comfort it is to me, not onely that I goe the way of those great men in their severall Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
            <p>Ans. <hi>Indeed it was a great favour to grant him leave to dye such a honourable death? But this you see is not all, for hee lookes upon his death as meritorious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that so the very act will appeare in heaven, is his hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But also that my charge (if I may not be partiall) looks somewhat like that against Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 25. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> for hee was accused for the Law and the Temple, that is the Law and Religion; and like that of Saint <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> in the 6. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> for breaking the Ordinances which <hi>Moses</hi> gave us, which Ordinances were Law and Religion: but you'l say, doe I then compare my selfe with the integrity of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and Saint <hi>Steven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>Yes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and here he shewed a great deale of Arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in it too, his cause and theirs being quite contrary. Yet he saith:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No, God forbid, farre be it from me; I onely raise a comfort to my selfe, that these great Saints and servants
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51530:7"/>
of God were thus layd up in their severall times; And it is very memorable that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who was one of them, and a great one, that helped on the accusation against Saint <hi>Steven,</hi> fell afterwards into the selfe-same accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion himselfe, yet both of them great Saints and servants of God.</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>This seemes verily to rise from the pride of his heart, and we may all see how justly God hath requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed him for the evill he hath done to these Kingdomes, which he was too proud to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ply to himselfe in that particular concerning</hi> Pauls <hi>fall who before helped forward the accusation against</hi> S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ephen: <hi>seeing he was the man that helped forward the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation against the</hi> Scots <hi>to cause them to be proclaimed Traytors, and</hi> Bendfield <hi>to be hanged, drawne and quartered as a Traytor, it was just with God to caase him to dye under the condemnation of a Traytor, though hee was too lofty to stoppe downe before the throne of Gods justice, and lay it home to his Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I but perhaps a great clamour there is, that I would have brought in Popery, I shall answer that more fully by and by, in the meane time, you know what the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees said against Christ himself, in the eleventh of <hi>Iohn; If we let him alone, all men will beleeve on him,</hi> Et ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niunt Romani, <hi>and the Romans will come and take away both our place and the Nation.</hi> Here was a causlesse cry against Christ that the Romans would come, and see how just the Iudgement of God was, they crucified Christ for feare least the Romans should come, and his death was that that brought in the Romans upon them, God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51530:7"/>
them with that which they most feared: and I prey God this clamour of <hi>veniunt Romani,</hi> (of which I have given to my knowledge no just cause) helpe not to bring him in; for the Pope never had such a Harvest in <hi>England</hi> since the Reformation, as he hath now upon the Sects and divisions rhat are amongst us; in the meane time, <hi>by honour and dishonour, by good report and evill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as a deceiver and yet true,</hi> am I now passing out of this world.</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>To passe by this caution (for indeed we may already say</hi> veniunt Romani, <hi>and indeed the Pope never had such an Harvest in</hi> England; <hi>but who may we thanke for this, did not the Archbishop act his part in this, yea verily, and both countenanced, and encouraged the Queene, and told her that with a good Conscience shee might goe on according to those Principles, which occationed all this, which gave opportunity to such Armyes of Papists in the three Kingdomes;) but let us see what it is, hee saith further of this in the insuing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, first taking a view of that hee saith concerning the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some particulars also I thinke not amisse to speake of: and first this I shall be bold to speake of the King, our gracious Soveraigne, He hath been much traduced by some for labouring to bring in Popery, but upon my Conscience (of which I am now going to give God a present account) I know him to be as free from this Charge I thinke as any man living, and I hold him to be as sound a Protestant, according to the Religion by Law established as any man in this Kingdome, and that He will
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51530:8"/>
venter His Life as farre and as freely for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I thinke I doe or should know both His affection to Religion, and His grounds upon which that affection is built, as fully as any man in England.</p>
            <p>Ans. <hi>Jt is rather conceived that by the labours, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Queene, and the Iesuits, and Priests, and Fryers, that by the Archbishops means have been suffered at Court, the King hath been brought to doe what he doth. And till now the Archbishop never once talkes of Conscience and now he speakes his Conscience, you see what it is that he saith, J know him, I thinke him; I hold him to bee a Protestant, and I thinke I know his affection, and the grounds upon which upon which that affection is built; Is this an expression for such a man as he, that is an Arch-Bishop to bring his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence too, that gives no satisfaction at all, he had been better to have said nothing at all of him. But let us see what he saith of the City of</hi> London, <hi>for that is the next particuler he speaks of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second particular is concerning this great and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous City, which God blesse; here hath been of late a fashion taken up to gather hands, and then go to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and great Court of the Kingdome, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and clamour for Iustice, as if that great and wise Court, (before whom the causes come which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the many;) could not, or would not doe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, but at their call and appoyntment; a way which may endanger many an innocent man, and pluck innocent bloud upon their owne heads, and perhaps upon this City also, which God forbid: and this hath beene lately

               </gap>d against my selfe, God forgive the setters of this, with all my heart I begge it, but many well-meaning peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are caught by it: In Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> case, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else would serve, they stirred up the people against him, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. and <hi>Herod</hi> went just the selfe-same way, for when he had kill'd Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> he would not venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Saint <hi>Peter</hi> too, till he saw how the people tooke it, and were pleased with it, in the 12 of the <hi>Act.</hi> But take heed of having your hands full of bloud, in the first of <hi>Isai.</hi> for there is a time best known to himselfe.</p>
            <p>Ans. <hi>Here you see he seemes to looke back to the Earle of</hi> Strafford; <hi>whom he compares to</hi> Stephen, <hi>and seemes to charge the Parliament that the City comming with Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against him, to them, and finding that</hi> Straffords <hi>death pleased the people, therefore they put him to death also: and from thence charges the City with bloud, wherein he now flies quite from what he said before, and most enviously, goes about to doe what he can to blemish the Parliament, and the City of</hi> London; <hi>when he said before that he charged nothing upon his Iudges; and whereas he speakes as if the way that hath been taken with him, may endanger an innocent man, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously knowne that in this he lyes against his own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, well knowing, that never any Subject in</hi> England, <hi>had a fayrer tryall, and more liberty and priviledge, and favour all along than he, the like was never shown to any man in his case, if hee could have defended himselfe, and that his Counsell knew right well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God among other sinnes makes inquisition for bloud; and when inquisition is on foot, the Psalmist

               </gap>oud, and therefore with my Prayers to avert the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie from the City, let mee desire that this City would remember the Prophesie that is expressed, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> 16.15.</p>
            <p>Ans. <hi>He should have taken this into serious Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when he pesecuted the poore saints of God from place to place, never suffering them to be at quiet but going a thirsting for their bloud from day to day, for whereas he talks of Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition for bloud.

            </p>
            <p>The third particular, is this poore Church of England, that hath flourished and been a shelter to other neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Churches, when stormes have driven upon them; but alasse, now it is in a storme it selfe, and God knowes whether, or how it shall get out; and which is worse then a storme from without, it is become like an Oake cleft to shivers with wedges made out of its owne body, and that in every cleft, prophanesse and irreligion is cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51530:9"/>
in apace; while as <hi>Prosper</hi> saith, Men that introduce prophanesse are cloaked with a name of Imaginary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; for we have in a manner almost lost the substan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce, and dwell much, nay too much a great deale in Opinion, and that Church which all the Iesuitical machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in these parts of Christendome could not ruine, is now fallen into a great deale of danger by her owne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We may say so too with sad hearts, but from whence came these stormes; wee may all know the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and the Prelaticall Clergy, raised thereby contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-mony, to invite the King to warre against his owne Subjects; at which time the Arch Bishop was very active: and none did presse it forward more then he. These, and the Iesuites and Papists amongst us, are those wedges that are driven into the body of this Kingdome; to rent and teare it to pieces. It was horrible impiety that they dayly committed, and still doe commit, and suffer to bee committed; and sowed pillowes under the Elbowes of of those that live in such prophanenesse? and yet these men like the Arch-Bishop, will call themselves Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants. But I pray God to blesse the Parliament in their setling of this great Reformation, who labour to cast off all that Imaginary Religion, which the Prelates imposed upon us: and so setled the Church, according to that rule which is written in the word of God. But in the last place, see what he saith of himselfe.</p>
            <p>The last particular (for I am not willing to be tedious I shall hasten to goe out of this miserable world) is my selfe, and I beseech you, observe me, I was borne and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51530:10"/>
baptized in the bosome of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it stands yet established by Law, in that profession I have ever since lived, and in that profession of the Protestant Religion here established I come now to die; this is no time to dissemble with God, least of all in matter of Religion, and therefore I desire it may be remembred, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lived in the Protestant Religion estabished in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in that I come to die, What Clamors and Sland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers I have endured for labouring to keepe an Uniformitie in the externall service of God according to the Doctrine and Discipline of this Church all men knowes, and I have-abundantly felt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Arch-Bishop hath been alwayes very la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious to cause the memory of him to remaine, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, that moved him to write the day of his own life; and many other things: as particuler this last speech of his, which for that purpose he gave a Copy to Doctor <hi>Sterne,</hi> but to take a view of this expression of his, where he professeth himselfe a Protestant of the Church of England: but what is it to say so, hee is not charged for, being a Papist himselfe; but for labouring to bring in Popery. It may be the Pope came not high enough, and (as some say) would have sent another Cardinall from Rome to have overtopt him, and so he kept off for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; only held a Correspondencie with his freinds here: and so would have both Religions for the present to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. And in this, he rather appeared an Atheist indeed; for he was like a Camelian of divers colours, sometimes punishing the poore Sect of Romish Preists, but the fat ones he protected; and cherished such as Father <hi>Leader,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:51530:10"/>
superiour of the Benedicts, Master <hi>Flanders,</hi> and Master <hi>Price</hi>; and Master <hi>Gascoygne,</hi> &amp;c. and the whole order of the Iesuites: and feasted, and adored the great ones; such as Sir <hi>Cellam Digby</hi> and others: and because hee could not be Pope of Rome, intended to bee a Cardinall in these Kingdomes: as a Popish Preist (Father <hi>Browne</hi> by name) confessed, and was put upon the bringing in of Altars, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and other superstitions into the Church by Father <hi>Leader,</hi> when he eame into England; and by the advice of the Court Papists to bee cruell in the high Commission a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst godly people under the name of Puritans: and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists, &amp;c. And the like hee used, in his verdict at Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. In all which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the truth of it is, that I think he had his Religion to choose; but concerning the Treason hee is charged with, he saith thus.</p>
            <p>Now at last I am accused of high Treason in Parl. a crime which my soule ever abhorred, this Treason was charged upon me to consist of two parts: an endeavour to subvert the Law of the Realme, and a like endeavour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the true Protestant Relgion established by those Laws. Besids my answers which I gave to the several char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, I protested my inocency in both Houses, It was said Prisoners Protestations at the Barre must not be taken <hi>de ipso</hi>; I can bring no witnesse of my heart, and the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, therfore I must come to my Protestation, not at the Barr, but to my Protestation at this houre and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of my death, in which (as I said before) I hope all men will be such charitable Christians as not to thinke I would die and dissemble my Religion, I doe therfore here, with that caution that I delivered before, without

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>secundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> and so to be understood, I die in the presence of Almightie God and all his holy and blessed Angels, and I take it now on my death, That I never endeavoured the subvertion of the Lawes of the Realme, nor never any change of the Protestant Religion into Popish superstition: and I desire you all to remember this protest of mine, for my innocency in these and from all manner of Treasons what soever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> You see, the Arch-Bishop he shamefully denies to be guilty of the Treason proved against him, first in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and secondly in generall. All which, as hath beene shewed already, was fully proved against him. But that he calls God, and the holy Angels to witnesse, and take it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his death, that hee never indeavoured to subvert the lawes of the Realme, nor never any change of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion into Popish superstitions; this is most despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of all the rest. For (as you shall see by and by) hee in part confesseth himselfe guilty of the one, in endeavouring to subvert the Parliament, the very fountaine of the Lawes of the Realme. And for the other, if he had never any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to change the Protestant Religion into popish super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, why did hee so many things for the popes Agents against the protestants here, to get into the popes and the Queens favour, as hath been said already; why did hee at the instigation of the Iesuites use the godly protestant Ministers, with such rigour; and why did he impose a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer book (that came from Rome upon the Scots) and why did hee counsell the King to put out a book for sports on the Lords day. And the like evident demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51530:11"/>
of his indeavours to bring in popery. But to come to his conclusion.</p>
            <p>I have bin accused likewise as an enemy to Parliaments no, God forbid, I understood them, and the benefits that comes by them, a great deale too well to be so, but I did indeed dislike some misgovernments (as I conceived) of some few one or two parliaments; and I did conceive humbly that I might I have reason for it, for <hi>corruptio optimi est pessima</hi>: There is no coruption in the world so bad as that which is of the best thing in it selfe, for the better the thing is in nature, the worse it is corrupted; and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the highest and greatest Court, over which no other can have any Jurisdiction in the Kingdome, if by any way a misgovernment, which God forbid, should any wayes fall upon it, the Subjects of this Kingdome are left without all manner of remedy, and therefore God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them, and blesse them, and direct them, that there may bee no mis-conceit, much lesse mis-government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them. I will not inlarge my selfe any further, I have done, I forgive all the world, all and every of those bitter enemies, or others whatsoever they have been, which have any wayes prosecuted me in this kind, and I humbly desire to be forgiven first of God, and then of every man, whether I have offended him or no, if hee doe but conceive that I have; Lord, doe thou forgive me, and I beg forgivenesse of him, and so I heartily desire you to joyn with me in prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> See what jugling here is, wherein almost in every line he contradicts himselfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:51530:12"/>First, he denies that he hath been an enemie to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (No, God Forbid) and yet in the next line but one he confesseth that he misliked one or two Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and conceives he saies that he might have reason for it.</p>
            <p>The second, he doth acknowledge it to be the highest, and greatest Court, and yet by and by calls it Misse-Governement.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he saith that none can have Iurisdiction over the parliament, and yet doth himselfe presume to dislike thereof.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He pleads for his owne Innocencie, and hath presumed to traduce the King to breake up former parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and yet should parliaments bee hindred by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government (<hi>which must be by force, or by tretchery of their enemies</hi>) He confesseth that we should there be blest with all manner of Remedie. And hath thus made a Confused distracted Conclusion; he standing still upon his owne righteous dealings, his forgiving of all men, and desires all to forgive him, in which he is so plausible, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, even to those who do but conceive that hee hath wronged them: And praies to God to forgive him, and so after his prayer execution was done upon him.</p>
            <p>In all which there is you see nothing of faith or assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but all of Workes and Merits, and Superarogation as you have seene at large.</p>
