            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Authour of this small discourse, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (giue mee leaue so to call him) the Swan that, before his death, sung this divine song, is now thear, whear he neither needs the praise, nor feares the envy of any: whose life, as it deserued all, so it was cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of no mans commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; himselfe beeing as farre from pride, as his desert was neere it. Yet because it was his griefe, that hee should die before hee was fit to doe God the service hee desired; and his freinds desire, that bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so fit as hee was for his seruice, hee might (if it had been possible) neuer haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:3310:5"/>
at all: thearfore his booke was bould to thrust it selfe into that world, which the Authour of it had lately left, therby to satisfie both his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers desire, in doing the church of God some seruice; and his friends griefe in not suffering him altogether to lie dead.</p>
            <p>And truely what better ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice can it doe, then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade with reason, since Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie forces not, our young Neophytes to abide awhile in the schooles of the Prophets, at <hi>Bethel,</hi> before they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to enter the Temple at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and if reason can doe little with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause happily they want it, yet let his <hi>Example</hi> (an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:3310:5"/>
that prevailes much with the common People, of whome such Prophets are the tayle) make them at least see, and confesse, though they know not how to amend their fault. Ten yeares had hee liued in the Vniversitie, eight lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages had hee learnt, and taught his tongue so many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall waies by which to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse a good heart; watching often, daily excercising, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way studying, in a word, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an ende of himselfe in an ouer-feruent desire to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit others; and yet, after hee had, as it wear out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, sweat out all this oyle for his lampe, after hee had with the Sunne ran so many
<pb facs="tcp:3310:6"/>
heauenly races, and, when the Sunne was laied abed by his labours, after hee had burnt out so many candles to giue his minde light (hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies S <hi>Pauls</hi> querie in his minde, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;) hee neuer durst adventure to doe that, after all these stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies done, and ended, which our young Novices, doeing nothing, coumpt nothing to doe: but still thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as vnfit, as hee kniew all men weare vnworthy of so high an honour, as to be the Angells of God.</p>
            <p>I could wish that he had left behinde him, if not all his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet some of his modesty to be deuided among these empty
<pb facs="tcp:3310:6"/>
sounding vessels, that want both: but since in him so great examples of piety, knowledge, industrie, and vnaffected mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie are all fallen so deepely a sleep, as I am afraid we shall hardly find in any of his age the like, (which I speake not to deny iust praise to the liuing, but who wil not affoard a fiew flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to strowe the cophine of the dead?) thear was no way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken them, and in them him, but by layeing them vp, not with him in his graue, but in these immortal monuments of the presse, the liuing Tombes proper to dead learning, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these flowers may liue, though their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>MOst gracious, and deare Parents, I could neuer yet perswade my selfe to be of <hi>Galbas</hi> mind, who thought it needlesse that any man should be tied to giue an accoumpt of his idle time; much lesse of <hi>Pericles,</hi>

Common-wealths Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, did not thinke so much how to make his accompt, as how to make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt at all: but since the season doth in a manner now require, that I send you some fruits of your so long, and so well manured, and so carefully planted, &amp; yet so long barren vine, (as whose fruits you haue with patience for many more yeares expected, then that Husbandman did the fruits of his barren figtree) though as yet it beeing the first spring, it can send forth but small grapes, yet such as they are, since they be not wild grapes, I hold it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3310:8"/>
honest so farre to serue the time (though no time ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer) as of mine owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord (vnlike those bad hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen in the Gospel) to offer them vnto you. And because I know that as it is your greatest desire, so it would be your greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, if now after you haue mist me from you (not as <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> did Christ for three dayes) but for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares, you should at last find me (as they did <hi>Christ</hi>) in the Temple praying, and going about the busines of my heauenly Father; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had once, I confesse, in my resolution pledged my self (as <hi>Iudah</hi> made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

For good reason it seemed to me (to invert S. <hi>Pauls</hi> argument) reaping your temporall things, to make you partakers of those spirituall things, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3310:9"/>
I haue here learned at your charges in Christs schoole. In this conceit somewhat I conceiued, but in a word (to expresse my issue in the Prophets phrase) when the children came to the birth,<note place="margin">Isa. 37.3.</note> there was not strength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth: howsoeuer, I thought it wisedome to deferre that expectation of me, which I was not yet able to satisfie by this short Apologie of my long seeming silence. For since you haue beene vnto me farre vnlike <hi>Iobs</hi> vnnaturall Ostrich, which, depriued of vnderstanding leaueth her egges in the dust, and forgetteth them:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3310:10"/>
or his wilde hindes, and goats, that bow themselues and bruise their young, and cast forth their sorows, and so leaue them, but rather as pious <hi>Anna,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1.

In the meane time, my Apologie in a word is the same that is expressed in the Gospel in the behalfe of the fig-tree: That my time of fruit is not yet (by Gods grace) past, but onely that it is not yet come; neither shall it (I trust) preiudice my cause, that in the like case the fig-tree

was neuertheles accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,<note place="margin">Harmon. pag. 117.</note> since (as <hi>Calvin,</hi> the best Interpreter I finde, cleares the place) Christ did it not in splene, to reuenge himselfe on the harmelesse tree, but onely tooke occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to worke a miracle for the propagation of Gods glorie, diuerting, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his hunger with the bread he speakes of, Ioh. 4.34. making that his meat to do the wil of his Father.</p>
            <p>But (that I may solue the meane obiection) since there are so many <hi>praecoces fructus,</hi> rathe, and forward fruit, ripened, and readie in lesse then halfe my time, whatsorie seed and soile is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3310:11"/>
mine, that my time of fruit is not yet come: I graunt, both may be true in mee, but for the other, I rather pitie, then envie them; so farre is it, that their laste should be the measure of my foote, or I be induced to be the <hi>Eccho</hi> to such voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or speake after them, because they speak, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede like the Spartans nightingales,<note place="margin">Plutarch. in Ages.</note> are meere sound, and nothing els.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3310:12"/>
what were it else, but (as the Spaniard speaketh) to escape the thunderbolt, and fall into the lightnings slash? For alas, what a fond conceit is that of theirs (it beeing the guise of fooles (as the Italian hath it) to thinke themselues wise) so easily to perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues like those foolish Laodiceans,<note place="margin">Revel.</note> that they are quickely learned, able and sufficient enough, as if <hi>Nox nocti indicaret scientiam,</hi> and the blind could lead the blind, or could with that little learning they haue gotten (as Christ with a few loaues and fishes did by miracle) feede whole

multitudes, and haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder enough for other times; expecting that God should miraculously (as to the widow) multiply their little oyle, for the dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of so great a dutie, and filling of so many emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vessells: yea, although they haue too little oyle for themselues, yet (which the wise virgins would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doe) they must needs be storing others,<note place="margin">Matt. 25.9.</note> as if (Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan-like) they could swallow vp whole riuers at once,<note place="margin">Iob 40.18.</note> and thinke to drinke vp Iordan too: So that their learning is put into a bottomlesse bagge, that cannot hold it, and their

And when all is done, what is it that thus splents those tombes, but <hi>steriles mala robora ficus,</hi> which though it make much shift to come forth, is but a barren wilde figg-tree, that neuer brings forth fruit to maturitie: so that their ouer-hastines is no other then as a hatchet that cutts off their better growth.<note place="margin">Bion apud Laert.</note> For howe many that happily (as Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus said of Pyrrhus) might prooue some bodie,<note place="margin">Plut.</note> if they

And therfore no more then he, when he would accomplish that by strength of armes, which in his youth, and in the flower of his age with facilitie he performed (as he found by lamentable experience beeing made a pray to beasts, whilest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ould he sought to rend a splinted oake) should they arrogate vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues a task of elder years, thinking that (like the palme tree, and camomill) they shall grow the better

for beeing burdened and pressed downe. As for the fruit of this their arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and ostentation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are (or should be, had they so much grace) ashamed, it is but as the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian hath it, where pride rides, shame lackies, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the Prophet, while they sow the winde,<note place="margin">Ier. 48.10.</note> they reape the whirlewind.

For as great a danger as befalls the commonwealth when children are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">Eccl. 10.16.</note> and gouernours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the like betides the Church when these which are indeed but children, &amp; babes in Christ,<note place="margin">1.

take vpon him to heale the soares of Sion, to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of as many soules, as those vnskilfull Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners doe hazard the liues of diuers bodies. S. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> in his book <hi>de cura pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali</hi> saith,<note place="margin">part. 3. c. 26.</note> that it is as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for such Nouices to vndergoe the burden of a pastorall charge, as to lay the roofe of the house vpon the walls while they are greene; a readie means to ruine, not to build. And indeed for any burthen they sustaine in the Church (for rather like the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,<note place="margin">Matt. 23.4.</note> they bind heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens on other mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, but put not so

much as a finger thereto themselues) I cannot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter compare them, then to those little statues, or ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets that we often see affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the pillers of our Churches, stooping the head, &amp; bending the back, as if they did support the whole fabricque, whereas they sustaine nothing at all, but are rather themselues supported. Good cause therefore had Saint Paul to put in that caution to Timothie,<note place="margin">1.

condemnation of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. For indeed to suffer such to take a charge vpon them, what else were it, but as if the trees of the forrest should rest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnder the shadow of the bryer; the issue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was but this, the fire came out of the brier, and deuoured the Cedars of Lebanon.<note place="margin">Iudg. 4.</note> Such fruit as this well argues, what is the tree:<note place="margin">Matt. 7.17.</note> and for my part I wonder not if such fruits as these like wilde grapes, and crabbes come vp in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance. For it is as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie (God wot) as lightly to runne away, like an horse, with an emptie cart: (as

And happily these haire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braind vpstarts, whilst they glory in their own shame, may be truely answered, as that Italian answered that busie bodie, cracking how earely he had been vp, and how much idle busines he had dispatched, while the other lay in bed, that one dreame of his was better worth then all the others busines: and in the ende, as it fell out in Zeuxis &amp; Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhasius their emulation,<note place="margin">Plin. l. 35.</note> which had the masterie in his art, though the one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance with his painted

Neither makes it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for these bablers (for so may I as iustly terme them,<note place="margin">Act. 17.18.</note> as Saint Paul was vniustly) that the Apostles were inspired, since long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe it hath beene ordered, that miracles, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary callings ceased with the Primitiue Church: whereunto it was requisite as water for a new planted

garden; but now, that it is come to further growth, vnnecessarie: or if they will needes looke for miracles, such as these are as vnlikely to be the subiects therof, as dirt is to open the eyes of the blind (though Christ once powerfully vsed it to that ende,<note place="margin">Ioh. 9.6.</note>) a meanes rather to destroy, then restore the sight.

            <p>I Know my vncleane hands, O God, are not fit to carrie thy Arke, or touch those things that are hallowed, and consecrate vnto thee, my polluted lippes most vnworthy to take thy name into my mouth. What am I that I should speake vnto my Lord, by prayer, from my

selfe, and others, and yet liue, much lesse speak from my Lord, by his word, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others to make them liue in thee? yet since it hath pleased thee to call mee, standing idle in the market-place, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the vanities of this world so early into the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeard, it behooueth mee to labour, and willingly to beare the heate of the day, and gladly (while the light of the Gospel lasteth) to doe the worke of my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father, the workes of light. It is a burden, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that I vndergoe, but thine, O Christ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore light, and easie; it is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3310:46"/>
a yoake, but thine, and therefore sweete. Much more blessed are thine, then the Seruants of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> much more blessed, since in this Ministerie the heauenly Angels are their Seruants: not vnto vs, not vnto vs, Lord, but vnto thy name giue the glorie; thou art still the same gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious God, that shewest grace vnto the humble, and callest Publicans, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and poore silly soules (such as weare thy fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) vnto thee, because thou art able to get thee praise out of the mouthes of verie babes, and suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and euen of stones
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3310:47"/>
to raise thee vp children: and with the follie of thine to confound the wisedome of the world, let my soule therefore euer magnifie thy holy name, because thou hast ruised mee out of the dust to stand before thee, and hast shewed mee the light of thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and let mine eyes see thy saluation. To be a seruant of Seruants was once a curse, but to be a seruant of one of thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, is one of the highest blessings; thou thy selfe beeing Lord of all, deig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to serue thy Seruants, washing their feete, and it beeing an office wherein
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3310:47"/>
thy blessed Angels doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce. But howsoeuer it is an honourable calling, yet it is vnto thee a seruice, and not vnto ease, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Those that are in Princes Courts may goe in soft rayment, and liue at their ease, but not so they that serue in thy Courts, O Lord. Thy selfe didst begin thy preaching with a fast of fourtie daies, and didst enioyne to all that did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee to leaue all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasures, which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the world, they were to forsake, &amp; in stead thereof to take vp thy crosse, that so thy members maybe conformable vnto

their head. Men are all borne to labour, as a spark to flie vpwards, it is a curse that followed mans fall: but to labour in thy vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, is a blessing follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mans repayring, and redemption to keepe and dresse thy Paradise, thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed garden, as it was A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams charge, in the happie estate of his innocencie, so is it now the Ministers, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the happie restoring thereof. Thy vineyard laie desolate, and the wild bore of the forrest spoyled it; but thou hast new digged, planted, and hedged it, and built a Tower therein, and thou hast set it forth at a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3310:48"/>
price to thy Ministers to be the Keepers thereof; wherefore if it yeeld thee not the fruit, or doe not well entreate thy seruants, or suffer it to grow wast, they can looke for no other but to be cast thence out of thy paradise. Not without a cause did thy seruants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce that they were thought worthy to suffer for thy sake, and thy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs gladly shed their blood for the seed of thy Church, and to water what thou hadst planted. Thy first grace to thy seruant <hi>Paul,</hi> after thou hast chosen him for a vessell of thine hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, was to shew him what

Neuerthelesse as blessed were the pappes that gaue thee suck, so bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed also are those, whom thou hast made the Nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thy Church to giue them meate in due season: blessed the wombe that bare thee, and so that which beares thy children:

the wombe indeed that bare the Lord was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered without paine or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but thy children must be borne with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and trauell, and the Ministers are as it were daily to trauaile in birth with such as are begotten by them vnto thee, but they soone forget their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and reioyce, so that children be borne vnto thee, and thou makest them fruitfull, and takest away the reproach of their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennesse.</p>

Out of his hatred to thee, he seekes most to persecute these, whome thou hast set in thy stead, that the light of thy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beeing extinguished, and put out, and their Candlesticks remooued, he may walke himselfe in the darke, and that their eies

            <p>And now, Lord, since I am come into thy seruice, and haue left all to followe thee, let me neuer leaue thee to followe any other thing. For as thou couldst neuer haue chosen a worse seruant, so shall I neuer find so good a Master, or meet with such a seruice, it bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit onely, indeede, for thy heauenly Angels: but

Though, O Lord, it is not I that doe, or can do thee seruice. It is thou, that seruest thy selfe by me, as by an instrument: I haue not so much as moouing of my selfe, it is thou that workest in me both the wil and the power.

            <p>IF thy lightning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O Lord, had onely ceazed on my bones, and had not past my bodily sheath, and entred into my soule, my spirit (like a faithfull companion) should haue giuen some rest to my earthly taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and helpt to heale my infirmitie: but a wounded spirit in a bruised, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bodie, who can beare? Thou hast melted my very soule within mee, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nime of thine arrowes hath drunke vp my spirits: so
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3310:62"/>
that now both my bodie is vexed, because my soule hides it selfe from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and because thou hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thy face, my soule is troubled. And in what waters doth that <hi>Behemoth</hi> delight to drinke, but in such as are most troubled, who nowe (like a cunning fisher) hath laid his baites, and hooks in euery part of my soule, while I in these troubled waters am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to discerne or discouer them: but since thou hast sent thine Angel, O Lord, (as into the poole of <hi>Bethes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>) to trouble the waters, and they are gone ouer my soule; and my bodie (with
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3310:62"/>
Ionas) is cast into the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, O let me come out in thy good time, whole, and recured of all my infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, let the tempest of thine anger be at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth appeased. How long shall my sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced soule vnder this altar of flesh, wherein it hath been so long crucified, cry vnto thee; how long Lord holy, and true, before thou wilt heare the voice and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the cause of our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred spirits, iustly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining against the men of the earth, our earthly ly members? Thine answer is, but for a little season: but euen a little time, O Lord, semeth long without thee,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3310:63"/>
and as a thousand yeares is but a day with thee, so a day is as a thousand yeares without thee. But is this a question for me, who can make no ende of sinning, to aske, when thou wilt be pleased to make an ende of thy punishment? May not thy answer be to me iustly the same with that of Iehu to sinfull Ahabs motion of peace: what hast thou to doe with peace, as long as the iniquities of Iesabel, nay farre worse, remaine in thee? True Lord, if thou still looke on me with the eie of thy iustice, (which is as those eies which kill, what they behold) I knowe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3310:63"/>
thou must needes still pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish me, since the bow, and sword of thy iustice neuer depart emptie from the battells of the Lord against sinne, and sinners: but thou hast two eies, O God, one of Iustice, another of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: O let thine eie of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice looke vpon the merits of thy Sonne, an obiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to delight euen that iust eie: but bend thine eie of mercie vpon the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of thy seruant, that so when thy iustice hath seene my miseries made his, his merits by thy mercie, maie be made mine.</p>

haue spoiled and wounded me, leauing me nothing but a cureles bodie, and a carelesse soule, that sending out perpetuall streames, and issues of blood, readie presently to die: this not knowing, but denying thee his Maker, by whome one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is able to liue. O if thou wouldst but turn aside with the mercifull <hi>Samaritan,</hi> or turne backe, as to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man diseased with a fluxe of blood, or turne thine eie onely vpon me, as vpon Peter, my wounds should be washed, the issues of blood stopped, and my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall pardoned.

Dauids troubles, O Lord. Shall the hand of little Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, O thou most mightie, if a rauenous beare breake into his flocke, and steale awaie a sheepe, or if a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lion sallie out of his denne, and rent awaie a lambe from him, be able to deliuer them both from the mouth of the beare, and the pawe of the Lion; and shalt not thou be much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to rescue the sheepe of thy fold, and lambs of thy flocke? Or is that wild beast of the wood, or that roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lion, that going about hath long sought, and now, while thy face is turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, hath found whome to

Or was his Flocke dearer to him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thine is to thee? Or can Dauid become more mercifull, then his God? Or, if thou be that gratious God of whom <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> hath so often sung, that <hi>Thy mercie endureth for euer, thy mercie endureth for euer,</hi> is thy mercie come now vtterly to an end, or hast thou forgotten to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and shut vp thy bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells of compassion for euer and euer? Or what is it; is my sinne greater then it can be forgiuen, that so my

If <hi>David</hi> deliuered his lambe from the pawe of the beare, thou deliueredst <hi>Dauid</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pawe of the Lion: if he loued his flocke, by which he liued, sure thou must needs loue thine for whom thou diedst; nor is it likely, that thou hast shut vp thy bowells of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, since thou hast ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so large an entrance for vs in the side of thy Sonne, wherein all thy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bowells of compassion are laied vp: and how can our sinnes be aboue thy mercie, when thy mercie

is aboue all thy workes, and and thy workes aboue all others workes, nay when our wickedst worke hath something good in it, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an action, and so done by thy vertue, but thy least goodnesse hath in it not the least euill, beeing, like the Author, ful of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            <q> For in death no man will remember thee, and who will giue thee thanks in the pit?</q>
            <p>THou, O God, art the liuing God, the God

of the Liuing, and of the Land of the liuing. While we liue, we are bound to remember thee, &amp; though we are worthie to die, yet death is not worthy to take away the remembrance of thee. Thy glorie, and praise ought to be eternal, as thou art. Let them not perish then, O Lord, whom thou hast created vnto that end, the most excellent ende of all things created. How fewe such swans are there, O God, who sing vnto thee in their death, and perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how fewe that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee, with <hi>Ionas,</hi> in the bellie of the whale, or with Ioseph in the pit, or

with <hi>Daniel</hi> in the lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s den? who will not rather with <hi>Ezeckiah</hi> mourne, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are to goe downe into the pit, and with <hi>Iob,</hi> beeing cast downe, curse the day of their birth, and shewe themselues almost forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of all thy benefits; so farre will they be from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of thanks. In the pit there is mourning, and howling, and gnashing of teeth, but the voice of the Turtle, and the singing of birds is not heard there, the ioyfull shout of a King is not heard among them. It belongeth vnto the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the Lambe, in that euerlasting Sabbath,

and Iubile to sing perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>halleluias,</hi> and to cast downe their crownes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy throne, and to giue thanks, glory, and honour vnto him that sitteth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: and yet it belongeth vnto vs also, O Lord, in what measure, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are able, to doe thy will on earth euen as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, though not so well as it is done in heauen. O let not <hi>Isaac</hi> onely, but euen <hi>Ismael</hi> liue in thy sight: let vs sinners also liue, and not goe downe altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the chambers of death; not because we are worthy but to glorifie thy holy name.

            <q> I am wearie of my groanings, euery night wash I my bed, and water my couch with teares.</q>
            <p>DId holy David, a man after Gods owne heart, feele the hand of him, whose heart he so wel pleased, so angrie with him, that euen in the night season, when others eyes quietly reposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, his flowed so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly with teares, as if he would haue washed both

his eies, and bed, (the places where his Adulterie beganne, and ended) from the defilement of his sin? Oh then why should I be wearie of my groanings? For what teares will serue to wash out my Leopard spots, or cleanse my <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> hew? If I had a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine running in my head, with <hi>Ieremie,</hi> to make vp lamentations, yet weare it all too little; but I, as if the verie fountaine were dried vp, am become har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then the rocke in the wildernesse stricken with Moses rod: for that gushed out with abundance of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whereas I shed no

teares when the Lord stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. Thy seruant, O Lord, is a suiter for euerie plant, which thy heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther planteth, because it shall neuer be rooted vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: but let all thy plants O God, be watered with the teares of repentance, and then they will be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full indeed, and bring forth euen an hundred folde. They are the most accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table drinke-offering vnto thee, and more pleasing then if riuers of oyle were powred out before thee. These doe, as it were anew baptise vs in Christ Iesus, and wash away the filth of our flesh, as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3310:70"/>
of <hi>Iordan</hi> did <hi>Naamans</hi> leprosie, or as those waters of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> which, when they were troubled, euery one knew there was an Angel in them, and that some cure should presently be wrought. No water so precious, and of such ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as teares distilling from a repenting heart; it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the next place to the water of life, and is as the water powred out vpon <hi>Elias</hi> sacrifice, which was consumed with fire from heauen, or as a heauenly dewe retourning thither from whence it fell, and falling downe againe in showers of grace, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.

To other men, and in other causes, teares are like the bitter waters of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> but when the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> Gods children drinke thereof, they are streight-waies made sweet, and pleasant. For what if they now sowe in teares, they shall hereafter reape in ioy, and the eyes of the Spouse, that are nowe as doues eies, ouer the riuers of water, euer mourning and weeping, shall hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when all teares shall be wiped away from them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead thereof, be filled with laughter, &amp; anointed with the oile of gladnesse aboue all others. How oft is it
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3310:71"/>
mentioned that the teares of the godly come vp to the Lord, beeing onely their propertie, whereas al other teares doe descend, naturally to moue vpwards tovvards heauen. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede though the heauens be as moulten brasse, these (much more powerfull the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the droppes of raine, whose often fall, doth hollowe, &amp; peirce the hardest stones,) would supple, and mollifie them? We finde in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamities they moue the most obdurate heart to pittie, yea euen to a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie in our sorrowes, and one enemie forgiues ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and relents; if he seek
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3310:71"/>
it with teares: much more will they mooue the Lord to mercie, who stiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the God of pitie and compassion. Wherefore Christ professeth himselfe wounded, and ouercome with the eies of his spouse. No water, but the teares of repentance is of force to quench the fierie darts of Sathan, and put out the flames of Hell kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs. Therefore I will be no more weary of my groanings, but euery night will vvash my bed, and vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my couch vvith my teares.</p>

The Sunne of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is darkned in him, and the clouds returne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the raine, one sinne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an other, one mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie after an other:<note place="margin">Eccl. 12.</note> the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the house tremble, the strong men bowe, and they waxe darke that look out of the windowes: faith is weake, hope fainteth, and charitie faileth.

O that I could make an integrall separation of my self from them, and might not carrie my greatest enemies in my bosome so neere my heart, the lusts of it; but, in stead of that fountaine of death, be ioyned vnto the Fountaine of life, Christ

            <p>IT is a great grace of thee, O my Lord, to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer dust, and ashes to speake vnto thee, but it is as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with thee, as it is

great. For thou sufferest many to say vnto thee, Lord, Lord, whome neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse thou knowest not. It is a greater therefore that when we call vpon thee in the time of trouble thou wilt heare vs: and yet this also may seeme to be not so singular a mercie: for whatsoeuer is spoken, shall not he that made the eare, heare it? but so to heare our praiers, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and grant them, and then to heare the crie of our petitions, when the lowder crie of our sinnes would drowne their voice, this is a goodnes as neere vnto thy nature, as it is far

from our desert. O how vnlike are thy eares, that are alwaies open to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the poore, and needie, to those of the deaf Adder, that old Serpent, that stoppes his eares, and is inexorable, charme the charmer neuer so sweete? how vnlike to vs, O Lord, that (hauing eares) yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou callest for our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, haue none to heare thee, where contrariwise, thou (hauing none) when we call to thee, inclinest thine eares to heare vs. But certenly, O Lord, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that thy iust eares should heare the praiers of such as we are: for we know
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3310:77"/>
               <hi>God heareth not sinners.</hi> True Lord: and therefore thou hast got thee new eares, and least we should thinke these like thy other, hast set them euen vpon our Head <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>: with them thou hearest vs if we speak vnto thee, and our words passing through his mouth (as how can we speak vnto thee, but by our head) are set on fire by that Golden censor, and, like holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, make a sweet sauour vpon thine Altar. So that henceforth though our workes be all, like our selues, wicked, though our rough hands be the hands of Esau, yet our voice is
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3310:78"/>
Iacobs voice, and wee haue got the apparrell of our eldest brother <hi>Esau,</hi> and therefore we know that thou wilt blesse vs, we are sure thou wilt heare vs, and spare vs, though more sinnefull, then euer <hi>Sodome</hi> was. What though <hi>Abraham, Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were now liuing, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for vs, we are sure thou wouldst much lesse heare them for vs, then for their, and thine owne people of the Iewes: yet thou hast heard him for vs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conditioning, as with <hi>Abraham,</hi> for the sparing of <hi>Sodome,</hi> if fiftie, twentie, or ten iust men were found
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3310:78"/>
therein, hast spared vs all onely for one iust mans sake. In him therefore, with boldnesse, doe all thy Saints offer vp their gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vyals of odours, their prayers, before thee.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3310:80"/>
but loue mine enemies, and pray for them, that curse mee. If it be a fault, or a folly (as the world esteemes it) thou hast taught it mee, and I would willingly erre with thee my God; it is inough for the Disciple to be as his Master is. But yet there are some of mine enemies, I confesse, that made mee first an enemie vnto thee, O Lord, whom I hate with a perfect hatred, who are growne now so ill, as they are past my prayers, and haue gone further then thy mercie will follow them, euen into the gates, and mouth of hell, that gap't so

wide to deuoure me, with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. O let the sword of thy Iustice be drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvith the slaughter of these great, &amp; arch-enemies of thy inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, &amp; little flock, &amp; blessed be my Lord for carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, like Samson, the gates of hel, that they should not preuaile ouer mee, and so leading my captiuitie cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and casting my soules enemies into the pit they had prepared for me. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny farre greater starres, and fairer lights, then, I O God, hath the taile of that dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon dravvne dovvne after him from heauen, &amp; hadst not thou (to vvhom onely the fame belongeth) taken
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3310:81"/>
my cause into thine ovvne hand, I had also been vvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novved, &amp; caried like dust, and chaffe before the wind. Therefore, as thou hast broken these mine enimies in peices, so also scatter them, that the peices of the mangled Serpent may neuer come together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. O let not the deadly vvound of the head of the beast be healed, to make vvarre against thy Saints, and against the Lambe for euer.</p>

peasures betraied thee, I that whereas I should haue mortified the old man, and crrucified the lusts thereof, so oft haue grieued thy good spirit, and crucified the Lord of life within me, and so buried, and sealed him vp in an obdurate, and stonie heart, that it must be a great worke of thy power, and mercie to rise againe in me, and rowle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the stone: I that haue thus filled vp my measure of iniquitie with <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> how dare I with <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> so often mooue the Lord for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: I that haue so often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, how can I hope to be receiued again to grace,

and pardon: I that haue no other plea, but guiltie, how dare I importune the iust iudge, vnlesse, as that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did the vniust iudge, for iustice. Hath my best seruice vnto thee been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then theirs, who kneeling, &amp; saluting thee, haile king of the Iewes, yet crucified thee? wherein haue my prayers, and teares been better then those, of the hypocritall Pharisies, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeming for a time, and so full of sinne, that when I haue praied for forgiuenes, I had neede pray again for forgiuenes of my prayers. Ah my wretched soule mocke not thy Sauiour any longer with thy knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3310:83"/>
and prayers, like those soldiers that crucified him; thou hast gone alreadie further then <hi>Iudas,</hi> not onely betraying him, but beeing (which he denied to be) guiltie of the shedding of his innocent blood; think with thy selfe, how oft thou hast grieued his holy spirit, turning the grace thereof into wantonnes: how oft thou hast, when he of this mercie had healed thee, presently fallen into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laps far worse then thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer disease; how oft thou hast walowed thy self again in the mire, when hee had washt not thy feete onely, but thy head, and hands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3310:84"/>
how oft, when thy heauenly Physition had purged thee, returned to thy vomit. And now, Lord, with what fig leaues shall I couer the shame of my sinne, since I know thou hast cursed the fig-tree, that bore leaues only? Oh tell mee how with the Prodigall shall I returne to my Father? or if I doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, say, hast thou any more kisses, and embraces lest, for such a riotous Sonne? If the mountaines, which yet offended not, did tremble, and melt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at thy presence, and if euen thy holiest Saints at thy presence fell downe to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d almost for dead,

troubled, and amazed, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, surely they should die, because they had seene the Lord, if the Cherubins, that stand alwaie before thee, couer their faces, looking but vpon thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie-seate, O with what face shall a guiltie soule come before thee, when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares before thy seate of iustice?

O how the verie thought thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds mee, and, as if now,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3310:85"/>
like <hi>Balthazar,</hi> I sawe the handwriting against mee, makes mee tremble, and stand amazed, smiting my knees one against another; what can I say for my selfe, or what can I doe? what sinne-offring, what peace-offering shall I bring to make attonement with the Lord? what Moses, or Aaron haue I to stand betweene Gods destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angel, and mee? whom haue I to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for mee? I dare not approach to my Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, whom my sinnes may iustly make of a meeke Lambe, an enraged Lion vnto mee, I see no other but a two-edged sword

proceed out of his mouth for my destruction, and me thinkes hee is a proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whips to scourge me out of his Temple, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning those stripes, those thornes, those wounds vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee, which he hath vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily borne for mee, denying any more to beare my crosse: so that now though I crie vnto him Lord, Lord, he will not know mee, nor suffer mee any more to haue a part in the Sonne of <hi>Ishai.</hi> Since therefore thy sword is drawne, O Lord, against mee, what can I doe but laie downe my necke, and submit my selfe to the stroke of that Axe, that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3310:86"/>
cutteth downe all vnfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ill-fruitfull Trees. For if euen the death of a sinner, and ruine of a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched soule please thee, and may any way satisfie thy Iustice (as indeed it cannot, for thou delightest not in the death of a sinner) oh how willingly should I cast away my selfe, with <hi>Ionas,</hi> to accalme the tempest of thine anger against mee: but, alas, it is not my sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice can expiate my sins. It were a good fruit of my bodie, if it might be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the sin of my soule: but how can that satisfie for sinne, which it selfe is most sinnefull? O no, I confesse, O Lord, that I
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3310:86"/>
haue no other sinne-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring but my repentance left, nor other burnt-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring then an aggrieued heart, nor other drink-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring then teares, nor other incense then my sighes, nor other propitiation, or Priest, and Mediatour then thy selfe, O Christ. Thou art our King to protect vs, our Prophet to teach vs, our Priest to make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for vs, and thou hast promised to make vs also Kings, Priests, and Prophets vnto thy Father; but such is my vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, O Lord, that often when I would take vpon mee the Priests office, and offer my prayers (as thou
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3310:87"/>
hast taught mee) vnto my Father, which is in heauen, for pardon, that I am quite confounded, and haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to say for my selfe, and though I knowe thou art able to cure my dumbnesse, yet it is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for mee to heare thee open thy mouth to thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for mercie, then let my mouth be opened to crie for vengeance against my selfe. For I, more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall then Caine, haue slaine, not my yonger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but my selfe, nor my selfe only, but my elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; therefore my blood cannot but, with <hi>Abells,</hi> crie to heauen for vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, that spilt it: but
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:3310:87"/>
when I listen what the crie of thy blood, my elder brother, is, whom my sinne hath slaine, O how much better things doe I heare it speake, then the blood of <hi>Abel, Father forgiue him:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, if I speake for my selfe, my words are like the winde, that passe away, and goe I know not whither, but most likely with my selfe into the Land where all things are forgotten: but thine are like thine owne essence, O Lord, who art the eternall word, such as heauen, and earth may sooner passe away, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one tittle of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Do thou ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O gratious Sauiour, speake, and mediat for me;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3310:88"/>
let the many wounds infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on thee for my sinnes be as so many mouthes to craue mercie for me: O let thy blood, as when thou wert wounded it fel on the base earth, be distilled also by the grace, and merit thereof vpon me a vile, and vnworthy sinner; how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie were I if, as thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest <hi>Adam</hi> of red earth, so thou hadst made me of that fruitfull red ground which thou vouchsafedst to water with thine owne blood. Let thy stripes, O Christ, goe for the many stripes wherewith I, as an euill seruant, deserue to be beaten, thy death for that eternall death my sinnes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:3310:88"/>
haue as their hire deserued, and thy descent into hell for mine to free me from thence. Indeede if thou wert, as man is, prone to anger, nay were thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger kindled but a little, and were not thy mercy rather as farre aboue mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as his merit, how long since had I perished from the land of the liuing? If I looke vpon my sinnes, me thinks I should alwaies see thee before me (as thine Angel in the way of Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim) with the sword of thy iustice drawne against me, vpon which (as mad men doe vpon weapons) my sinnes make mee wilfully to runne, and I seem to my
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:3310:89"/>
selfe to lie (as <hi>Isaac</hi>) vnder thy sword for sacrifie, still expecting when thou shouldst come by mee in the whirlewindes, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, and tempests of thy iudgements: yet to see, how thou (that no man might denie it to proceed only of grace, and not of merit) chusest rather to come in the still, and soft voice of thy mercies euen vnto vs sinners, &amp; wilt that thy holy spirit (the spirit of meeknes) come down ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the forme of a doue, without gal, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire vnto vs. How far art thou from desiring the death of a sinner, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we were both branch, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3310:89"/>
roote vnder the Axe of thy iudgements, and (as Isaac) readie to be sacrificed, and made a sinne offring, didst prouide thy selfe a Lambe, (yea thy selfe the Lambe) to saue vs, and to set vs free. How readie art thou to snatch the perishing brand out of the fire, how soone entreated to forbeare, and spare the fruitlesse figtree, not doing that vnto the dry tree, which thou hast done vnto the greene?
