            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Chance Cuſtomer, OR Caſual Reader.</head>
            <p>THAT thou mayſt not loſe thy Time, or thy Money, in the purchaſe, or peruſal of this Pamphlet; I think my ſelf bound in Juſtice, to acquaint thee before hand, that thou wilt meet with nothing New in it. Both the <hi>Letter,</hi> and <hi>Reply,</hi> being written in the time of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Uſurpation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Letter</hi> was ſent to me from a Friend, with whom I had a long, and intimate acquaintance. He was a Gentleman of that worth, and Candour, and Nobleneſs of mind, as was not, I believe, to be match'd
<pb facs="tcp:52863:3"/>
among all his Party. To whom yet he came in but late, (inſomuch that even <hi>Barnabas</hi> alſo was carried away with their Diſſimulation) though I could never ſay he was truly Theirs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving utterly refus'd to ſit in Judgment upon the King, though he was nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and appointed by them. But he ſtill preſerved his particular regard and eſteem for me; whereby we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued our former converſation and correſpondence. Nay we were grown to ſuch a mutual confidence in each other; that as I could freely write or ſpeak to him, what I thought fit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fear of being betrayed: So He being of a free, and plentifull For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, gave me Commiſſion to his Caſhier in <hi>London</hi> to take up money, as often as I pleaſed, not exceeding Ten pounds at a time, to beſtow where I ſaw need. Which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly I often made uſe of, and always
<pb facs="tcp:52863:3"/>
beſtow'd it, as he knew I would, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt needy, and beſt deſerving of our ſuffering Clergy.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Letter</hi> here printed was the laſt I received from him. Which (abating onely the Complements, and Civilities wherewith it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed) I give thee whole and entire, as it came to my hands. While I was writing my <hi>Reply,</hi> and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt finiſhed it, News was brought me, that my Friend was dead. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, I went on with it, and having brought it to an iſſue, communicated it immediately to my honoured Friend and acquaintance, Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> Who beſtowing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind words upon it, (yet not without animadverting on a Phraſe, or two, which was ſoon amended) preſs'd me earneſtly to make it publick. Hereupon I went preſently to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and addreſſed my ſelf among the
<pb facs="tcp:52863:4"/>
Bookſellers, to ſee if I could meet with any among them that would adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with me ſo far as to get it printed.</p>
            <p>I went firſt to a Stationer, whom I could name, then living under St. <hi>Dunſtan</hi>'s Church in <hi>Fleetſtreet</hi>; who having formerly printed two or three Sheets of mine againſt the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I hoped might be perſuaded to attempt this alſo. But he having perus'd the Papers for ſome time, delivered them to me again, as too perillous for him to engage in. Then I went to another, whom I will not name, of whom yet I leſs doubted, chiefly as having Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation. But he having had the peruſal of them likewiſe, for ſome time, found them belike too hot, or too heavy; too dangerous, or too dull for him to meddle with. So that I was forced to return home with my Papers, <hi>Re infectâ.</hi> Where
<pb facs="tcp:52863:4"/>
throwing them aſide, I never had them from that time to this in my eye, or in my thoughts, to my beſt remembrance; not ſince his Majeſty's Reſtauration, I am ſure, till the 30<hi>th,</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1682/3. When ſearching for a Paper I had formerly writ on the occaſion of that ſad day, Theſe likewiſe fell into my hands. I was ſtrangely ſurprized at it: and haſtily running them over, I ſtreight deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them to a Learned, and Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Neighbour of mine, to ſee if there was any thing in them that might yet be uſefull to the publick. He tells me quickly, that theſe times having likewiſe a ſtrong tendency to Rebellion, nothing that had been ſaid, or could be ſaid, on that point, would be unfit, or unſeaſonable to obſtruct againſt it. And having read over the Papers, He added farther, That, ſince any new Commotions or
<pb facs="tcp:52863:5"/>
Rebellion, muſt be always bottomed upon the pretentions of the Old: Thoſe pretentions being clearly and advantageouſly laid down in the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and as fully, and clearly, to his thinking, anſwered, and taken away in the <hi>Reply,</hi> I muſt not ſuppreſs them any longer: But he impatiently exhorted me to make them publick.</p>
            <p>Upon this Encouragement I was perſuaded, even at this time of the Day, to ſubmit them to the wiſedom, and authority of my ſuperiours. And wrapping my ſelf up in the Intereſt, and Peace of the Community, am contented (if they think fit) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my private infirmities, and even the weakneſs of my younger years, without any variation at all, to thy View and Cenſure. Farewell.</p>

            <head>THE LETTER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THat inſtance of <hi>Jael,</hi> it ſeems, was it which gave you the greateſt offence. And I muſt confeſs, I think it was the weakeſt part of my Diſcourſe, and moſt unfit to have ſtreſs laid on it (if Edification rather than Conqueſt had been ſought) But yet, if I had been rightly apprehended in it, I believe, it would not have produced that effect. For I was far from making that a Rule, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, for other men to act by, without the ſame Spirit, and cauſe to juſtify them in the action. And ſo far from making any Rule of the Old <hi>Teſtament</hi> to be a certain guide for us now; That I doe not hold that any Rule of the New <hi>Teſtament</hi> will juſtify an action, that is conform'd thereto, unleſs it be done alſo in a New Teſtament Spirit. And that the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging men to ſome certain meaſures of Doctrine, or Worſhip, gathered from the New Teſtament, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration of the ſutableneſs of the ſeveral growths of Chriſtians thereto, has been the foundation of all that formality, ignorance, and implicit faith, which has built up, and maintain'd the <hi>Babel</hi> of our Chriſtian World. All the drift of that inſtance was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52863:6"/>
but to ſhew, that the People of God now (or ſome few of them) may poſſibly have the ſame extraordinary war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant againſt this <hi>Babel,</hi> as thoſe of Old had againſt that, and againſt the <hi>Canaanites</hi> before. But for thoſe who are exerciſed in thoſe ways by virtue of ſuch an Example, or by the obſervation of the Letter of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies (which yet ſpeak plainly enough of the deſtruction of this <hi>Babel</hi> in a warlike way by the People of God) I am perſwaded, that, if they have not a true ſpirit proportionable, they will thereby but bring the greater wrath upon themſelves. For we ſhall find that the Myſtery of <hi>Babylon</hi> reaches farther than we are aware of. For though it be held forth onely under the form of the City, and Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was divided into Kingdoms, and united again to that one City under that Eccleſiaſtical head; yet we are to learn thereby, that it is the evil prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, both in relation to Spirituals and Civils, which ruled moſt eminently in that Form, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and that every other Form, that partakes of them, is ſo far forth guilty of the ſame condemnation. And doubtleſs the greater condemnation is due to any State, or Perſon, that ſhall condemn that principle in that, or any other groſs appearance; and yet ſhall maintain the ſame themſelves in a more refined, and hyprocritical way. And what's this evil principle? But that implicit faith in Spirituals, and implicit obedience in Civils, by which the Governours both of Church, and State, have held that Holy ſeed in bondage, and hindred the improvement of that image of God in holineſs, and righteouſneſs, which was ſo much defaced in the firſt fall. And that this did reign eminently in our former Government, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent enough by thoſe principles, which denyed any
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52863:6"/>
Power to bound, or limit the King againſt his will; or to be above the Church in the interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to a particular man's conſcience. And, I wiſh, I could as well excuſe theſe powers that ſucceed, as I could condemn the former. But this onely is to be ſaid; That if that Zeal were right, it will lead the ſame perſons on to the deſtruction of what is of the ſame corruption in themſelves, and others under their power. And if the Lord do not perſwade their hearts to condemn themſelves, he will raiſe up others to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, as they have done thoſe before them. And though this remedy may ſeem to you worſe than the diſeaſe: yet there is none that can eſtabliſh any in ſo abſolute a way, as to prevent the danger of theſe kind of diſturbances. The ſtrongeſt <hi>Babel,</hi> that can be deviſed to keep a people from being ſcatter'd into theſe confuſions, is that form of abſolute Monarchy, and that in an hereditary way. But yet that muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of an opportunity for a juſtifyable reſiſtence, and ſo of all the evil conſequences which we would ſo much avoid. For ſuppoſe the King to be ſo abſolute; yet he may be either a Fool, or Mad, or otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper'd, ſo as to command thoſe things, which are abſolutely deſtructive to that Society, which he is bound to preſerve. In ſuch a caſe there muſt be ſome Council, or ſingle Perſon, that muſt govern the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth in his ſtead, for a time at leaſt. Now if this be ſo, there then they muſt alſo judge, when he is in ſuch a condition, or in any other, as deſtructive; and how long he continues therein; and not he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who will be ſtill the more incapable of owning his diſability, by how much he is really diſabled. But ſuppoſe the reſtoring the old form of Government would reſtore that abſolute peace, and happineſs to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52863:7"/>
the Nation, which is deſired: yet the means, which is maintain'd to bring it about, is worſe than the want of it. For that principle which makes it abſolutely neceſſary for the people to expoſe their lives, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes for it, and to keep thoſe Oaths, and Covenants, which were made to it, with that hazard will make them loſe their very being to gain a well-being (and be never the nearer it neither.) For if the people in this ſcatter'd, and diſarmed poſture, ſhould hold an avowed allegiance to the former Government, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves all to the Sword, as Traytours to this. And if they ſhall have ſuch a reſerve in their hearts, whilſt they pretend an acknowledgement to This, that can avail nothing to the Other's legal right, but ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe people the more inexcuſable that ſhall be taken in ſuch double dealing. For my own part, I have been as much afraid, as any of giving the leaſt encouragement to any thing that has been ſet up by theſe extraordinary ways. But, I doubt, I have miſſed many opportunities of doing good, by that nicety. And, when the Lord has once declared his will by a full Poſſeſſion; and ſeconded it with ſo many ſignal Providences; I think, we may doe well to ceaſe fighting againſt his Prerogative, which is to diſpoſe of the Kingdoms of men to whom he pleaſes, and not to be asked what he does, though he ſhould give them to the baſeſt of men. And truely I have found it but the fleſhly, and beaſtly part in me that has murmured at theſe changes, and will not look up to Heaven to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe all power to that wiſe Watcher, and Diſpoſer of all things. Methinks if that fourth Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi> were ſeriouſly peruſed, it ſhould hint ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might be for our ſatisfaction in this point.</p>

               <p>And firſt to begin with <hi>Jael,</hi> who ſtands in the Tent door and entrance of your Letter. She being in Arrears (as you remember) before, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of offence; I do not find how what you have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52863:8"/>
laid down here in her name, can paſs for good pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and make all even. For my exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your inſtance of <hi>Jael</hi> was this: That what was done by her indeed, as an Act of great Faith in believing the Word of God, and acknowledging that right which the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſo accordingly helping them againſt an Uſurper, and Oppreſſour, (who by the expreſs Word of the Lord was ſentenced to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed) ſhould be ſo far perverted and abuſed by you, as to urge her way and manner onely of doing it, <hi>viz.</hi> by Diſſimulation and Treachery to juſtifie the ſame practices now of Lying, and Treaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the bringing about what you pleaſe to call and fancy a good Work.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwered. Admitting, but not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>Jael</hi> did well (not onely <hi>bonum,</hi> but <hi>benè</hi>) what ſhe thus did, (for it might be a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and failing in her, for any thing the Scripture ſays to the contrary. And that ſo it was we ſhall afterwards evince.) Yet it will not at all follow, that the ſame way, though to as good an end, is lawfull or practicable now. For that there is this vaſt difference between us and her: That in her time, and to her (ſhe being not a Jew) it muſt be remembred (and ſo not concerned or acquainted with the Law of <hi>Moſes)</hi> there was no ſuch expreſs Law or Revelation from Heaven againſt it. And, where no Law is,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.15.</note> there is no tranſgreſſion: God winking at thoſe times of Ignorance,<note place="margin">Acts 17.30.</note> whereas now he commands all men every where Not to lye one to another;<note place="margin">Col. 3.9.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.6.</note> and, That no man go beyond or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud his Brother in any matter: Not to forſwear our ſelves,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.33.</note> but to perform unto the Lord our Oaths:

               <p>The adminiſtration of the Spirit then, differing from that ſince, and generally under the Goſpel, not onely in the degrees of it, whereby we are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to a higher pitch, and proficiency now in the ſame duty, than they of old; but alſo in the very kind, and Species of it, whereby many things were lawfull, and indifferent then, which now are not ſo: Nay many things pious, and holy then, which are now wicked, and damnable.</p>
               <p>And for full proof of this, I inſtanc'd particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Elias.</hi> Whoſe calling for fire from Heaven,<note place="margin">2 King. 1.10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>To all which, You are pleaſed to anſwer for your ſelf. That you are ſo far from making any Rule of the Old Teſtament, much leſs any practice there, a certain guide for us now without the ſame Spirit; That you do not hold that any Rule of the New Teſtament will juſtify an action that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52863:9"/>
thereunto, unleſs it be done alſo in a New Teſtament Spirit.</p>
               <p>Truely, Sir, what you ſay is very right, That a New Teſtament Spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> Charity is a neceſſary qualification to denominate any action to be truly good.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.3.</note> For, <hi>Though I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor, and have not Charity,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth me nothing.</hi> But this comes not home at all to the caſe. For the Queſtion between us is not, Whether any action can be good now without Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? But, Whether Charity, or a good end, can make any action (how foul and lawleſs ſoever) to be good? <hi>Bonum,</hi> ſay the Schoolmen, <hi>fit ex Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris; Malum è quolibet defectu.</hi> To make a thing evil, it is ſufficient that it fail in any one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance; but it muſt be perfect, and complete throughout to make it good. And therefore, though to be done without Charity, or a New Teſtament Spirit, be enough indeed to make any action evil: it will by no means follow from hence, That whereever Charity is, the action muſt ſtreight be good, ſuppoſing it to fail yet in ſome other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. For then all actions will be alike. Treaſon, Perjury, Lying, and the reſt, in an equal degree of vertue, and capacity to good, as Alms, and Prayers, and Martyrdom. As neither of them good, if not done in Charity: So by that they may all be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim'd into neceſſary acts of Piety, and Religion. Whereas theſe things are ſo intrinſecally evil, and <hi>ex natura Rei,</hi> that they can never be otherwiſe. Lying (for example) being ſo contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and eſſence of God, who is Truth it ſelf, that He can no more lye,<note place="margin">John 14.6.</note> than not be God. <hi>God cannot lye.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 33.19.</note> And what He cannot doe himſelf, no Spirit
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52863:9"/>
of his whether of the Old, or New Teſtament, can authorize, or approve any in the doing of it.</p>
               <p>But yet farther. The queſtion is, Whether in the New Teſtament times, an Old Teſtament ſpirit can be pretended, to juſtify any in thoſe old practices? For ſo your profeſſing not to make that inſtance of <hi>Jael</hi> a rule, or example for any to act by, without the ſame ſpirit: And afterwards, That thoſe who are exerciſed in theſe ways by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſuch an example, if they have not a ſpirit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable, will bring but the greater wrath upon themſelves, does pretty well imply what I onely charged you with; That you pretend therefore to the ſpirit of <hi>Jael</hi>; and ſo fall back from Chriſt to <hi>Moſes</hi>; from the Goſpel to the Law; Nay from that glorious midday-light in the Goſpel (which he that runs may reade) to ſecure your ſelves, as in <hi>Jael,</hi> in the darkneſs, and ignorance of the firſt Times.</p>
               <p>The Old Teſtament ſpirit was indeed the ſpirit of God; but fitted, and proportion'd to Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Old Teſtament, or Old Covenant it ſelf to which it ſerved. Which being now out-dated and ſuperſeded by a better,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.6.</note> a Covenant eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes: There is likewiſe a better ſpirit, that is to ſay, a higher, and more excellent adminiſtration of the ſame ſpirit in proportion to it. For, as the Apoſtle argues, that,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.12.</note> The Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood being chang'd, there is made of neceſſity a change alſo of the Law: So the Law, or Teſtament being chang'd, there is made of neceſſity a change alſo of the ſpirit. Though both from God, the Old Teſtament, and the Old ſpirit, yet both to be altered, and made better by him.<note place="margin">Luk. 9.55.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye know not what ſpirit ye are of</hi> (ſaith our <hi>Saviour</hi> to his three

Diſciples) <hi>For the Son of man came not to deſtroy, &amp;c.</hi> Thereby evidently diſtinguiſhing his ſpirit not in theſe three Diſciples onely, but in all that belong to the Son of man, and own him for their Saviour, from that deſtroying ſpirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> which ruled and govern'd in the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>The Law was given in Thunder and Lightning, as being the letter of condemnation, and ſo to be managed by a killing, and deſtroying ſpirit, always expreſſing it ſelf in Zeal, and fiery indignation (And from hence came that <hi>Jus Zelotarum</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi>) as in <hi>Phinehas,</hi>

                  <hi>Elias,</hi> and the whole Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> who conſecrated themſelves to the ſervice of God, and attendance on his Altar, in the bloud of their Brethren. Whereas the Goſpel of peace coming down like the rain into a fleece of wool, as being the miniſtry for reconciling ſinners to God; of ſeeking, and ſaving that which was loſt, is according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actuated with a ſpirit of Charity born upon the wings of a mighty love, and immortal patience; ſpreading, and ſtretching it ſelf to our greateſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies, and the higheſt oppoſers of Religion for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and not for their deſtruction. And, in a contrary method to the Levitical conſecration in the Old Teſtament, a main qualification to adapt, or conſecrate any one for the ſervice of the New, is <hi>That he be no ſtriker.</hi>

                  <hi>If ye be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, Chriſt ſhall profit you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> So the Old Teſtament ſpirit, which was accounted for righteouſneſs to <hi>Phinehas, Elias,</hi> and the reſt, will bring as ſwift deſtruction upon any now who pretend to it.<note place="margin">v. 4.</note> As many of you as are juſtifyed by the Law are faln from Grace. 'Tis a plain renouncing, and bidding farewell to the ſpirit of Grace, to juſtify your actions by the ſpirit of the Law: a preferring <hi>Moſes</hi> before Chriſt; a direct apoſtatizing to the ſect of the <hi>Jews</hi>: and the moſt hatefull oppoſition to Chriſt, and his Goſpel. Which is made ſo much more odious than the Judaiſm of Old, in as much as it pretends to this from a height, and growth in Chriſtianity: A Judaiſm not from the <hi>Jews,</hi> but <hi>Judas,</hi> who in appearance of kindneſs, and greater intereſt, and familiarity with his Maſter, did ſhameleſly betray him. Thus they are, forſooth, lifted above Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and while the reſt of the Apoſtles are put upon duties, Watching and Praying in the garden; While all other Chriſtians are under command to their Superiours, Defrauding no man, Truth in their promiſſes, and the like; and not thinking our ſelves worthy to ſit down with Chriſt on his Throne, eſteem it a ſpecial privilege to enjoy him in his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52863:11"/>
Sacraments;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.26.</note> 
                  <hi>To ſhew forth the Lord's death till he come</hi> (as we are bidden) in the Holy Supper; and to be born again of water,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.3.</note> and the ſpirit; as a neceſſary condition of ſeeing the Kingdom of God: <hi>Judas</hi> ruſhes in with a haſty kiſs: And ſo theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergrown Chriſtians with their lanterns, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and armed men, fall preſently a kiſſing of Chriſt; no longer to be kept off at the diſtance of a Sacrament or the reverence of a duty; but under colour of a greater growth, and intereſt in him, betray him manifeſtly to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that Old Teſtament ſpirit, in all his Laws, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſervices, to be crucified by them at their will.</p>
               <p>That there are indeed ſeveral degrees, and growths in Chriſtanity is perfectly true. There is the Babe, and the perfect man in Chriſt: there is the weaker, and the ſtronger Chriſtian; and that, both in reſpect of knowledge, and in reſpect of Grace, whereby ſome Chriſtians are more regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, have mortified farther than others: Some Chriſtians are more knowing, and ſo at greater freedom, and liberty than others. But yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are all within the ſame incloſure of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws, and Commandments of Chriſt. The leſs knowing Chriſtian may perhaps miſs ſome part of that liberty, which Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for him; but the moſt knowing muſt not dare to tranſgreſs the leaſt law, or command of his Maſter. The freedom onely lies in matters of a middle nature; which being under no command or prohibition at all, the weak, or ignorant Chriſtian does by his want of knowledge conceive otherwiſe; and ſo obliges himſelf to doe or not to doe, accordingly.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52863:11"/>
And thus likewiſe in the growth of Grace, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of mortification; He that mortifies leaſt, muſt yet be ſuppoſed to mortifie every known luſt, and to practiſe an Uniform obedience to the Laws of Chriſt. He that is partial to himſelf in either is but almoſt a Chriſtian. The degree conſiſts not in mortifying this ſin which another does not; or in obeying this law, or command of Chriſt, which another Chriſtian on the ſame occaſion would not: But in mortifying this ſin in a greater meaſure; hating it with a more perfect hatred; watching more diligently againſt the occaſions, and provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which lead to it; praying more frequently, and earneſtly againſt it. So in obeying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with a greater deſire, and delight, <hi>Virtutis amore,</hi> making it our own choice; judging the command moſt fit, and reaſonable; the yoke to be an eaſie yoke; and ſo our obedience, and ſubmiſſion to it the very pleaſurable part of our lives. And yet farther enlarging our mortification to ſome freedoms, and Indulgences allow'd unto us by God, and his Church, wherein we think fit to reſtrain our ſelves. <hi>All things are lawfull for me</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>but I will not be brought under the power of any.</hi> And thus in our obedience;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.12.</note> not confining it barely to the plain laws, and commands of our Lord; but aiming likewiſe at his counſels, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring towards perfection. And while we might without ſin, nay doe well, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.38.</note> by giving our Virgin in marriage; yet reſolve by giving her not in marriage to doe better.<note place="margin">Act. 19.30.</note> Put our ſelves with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle into the Theatre, when we might have the benefit to eſcape Perſecution.

               <p>But yet, all this makes nothing at all againſt obliging men to ſome certain meaſures of doctrine and worſhip, gather'd out of the New Teſtament. For that ſome doctrines there are in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo apprimely neceſſary, that he is not a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that is ignorant of them, or does not believe them. Some parts of God's worſhip are of ſuch univerſal intereſt, and concernment, that no Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Church, or communion, can be without them. And to pretend a weakneſs, or unſuitableneſs of our ſpirits unto them, is to profeſs our ſelves really Infidels. And for other doctrines, as Stars of a leſſer magnitude, yet certainly God's revealing them unto us in the New Teſtament, does lay an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon us of receiving them, as ſoon as they are propounded unto us by authority of his word. And ſo for our worſhip, if it take in all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God in this matter, and add nothing forbidden by him, ſupplying the reſt with a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſpect to God, and our ſelves, and the whole Church, I know not what fault there can be, in obliging men to an obſervation of it.</p>
               <p>Weakneſs of Conſcience was very pleadable in the days of the Apoſtles, and firſt planting of Chriſtanity. When, all men being <hi>Jews</hi> or Gentiles, the Chriſtian <hi>Jews</hi> were to receive Doctrines, and Sacraments, utterly deſtructive to what they had received before from the mouth of God, which was given unto them by the Miniſtery of Angels; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by Miracles; and endear'd unto them by the Wiſedom, and witneſs of all Ages. And no marvel
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52863:12"/>
if pious ſouls ſtuck now and then, could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly unlearn the Religion of the Prophets, and Patriarchs; of God, and his holy Angels; nor ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low down every Camel without chewing. And ſo the Gentiles were brought by Chriſtianity into principles, and practices, where they were not onely to forget what they had been formerly taught, and brought up in, and wherein they had liv'd; but utterly to condemn it, and themſelves for it. All the divine Myſteries, and Rites whereby they were accepted by their Gods; admired in the world; made auſpicious, and lucky in their ſeveral under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; were now to be mortifi'd, as ſo many beaſtly, and unnatural luſts: Their nobleſt, and moſt Heroical Vertues, as Ambition, Pride, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and the like, inſtantly metamorphoſed into ſo many horrid vices. Their Heaven turned into Hell; and their Gods not to be rejected barely as no Gods, but to be hated, and abominated by them as down-right Devils. And in lieu of all theſe to take upon them the Doctrine of the Croſs, and the Worſhip of a Crucified <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what wonder, if in this haſty flight from royal <hi>Sodom</hi> to little <hi>Zoar,</hi> there be ſome lookings back; if in this Violent change from the extremity of Cold to extreme Heat, there is ſome doubtings, and <hi>Deliquiums?</hi> Which yet (it is very obſervable) were not at all indulg'd to by Chriſt or his Apoſtles; Heatheniſm it ſelf being a ſin, together with the Rites, and Appendages of it. However they had bound it to themſelves with long cuſtome, an early Education, and ſtrong perſwaſions; this gains them no Privilege or Toleration, no not for an hour. All the Allowances, and Indulgences, the Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52863:13"/>
and Compliances, were upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſtock, and intereſt. God had deceived them, as the Prophet ſpeaks, and they were deceived. And ſo the weakneſs being (in ſome ſenſe) His; the weakneſs of his Law to which they had been obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, they were for ſome time indulged by him in it; but this onely till they could be inſtructed in the periſhing nature of thoſe legal Ceremonies, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; and the abolition made plain to them from the ſame authority as had before eſtabliſhed them. And when this is once done, then at their own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril be it, if they ſtill continue them. Their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Conſcience will no longer be of force to plead for them. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had before, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with their weakneſs, been the Authour of Circumciſion to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 16.1.</note> becomes ſoon after as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a Preacher againſt it. <hi>If ye be circumcis'd, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.2.</note> And ſo having been a Catechiſt for ſome time to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and employed himſelf in laying down, and expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them the principles of Chriſtian Religion; at laſt, without conſidering the growth of their ſpirits, nay conſidering clearly that they were not grown; That,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.12.</note> whereas for the time they ought to be Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, they had need to be taught again their Old Leſſon; even the firſt principles of Chriſtianity. What? Does he think it neceſſary to comply with their weakneſs? To ſuit himſelf ſtill to their dulneſs? No. Their weakneſs, and dulneſs was utterly their own fault: For the time they ought to be Teachers. Therefore leaving,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.1.</note> ſays he, the principles, let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, &amp;c. And, as in Doctrines, thus he deals likewiſe in Ceremonies, or a Form of Worſhip. In
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52863:13"/>
his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> he declares how fit, and decent, and orderly it was for men to worſhip God bareheaded, and women covered. And this he proves by ſeveral <hi>Mediums,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> and from ſeveral Topicks. And when that is done, doth he make proviſion for tender Conſciences, or ſuch as ſhould be ſcandalized at it? Does he conſider the ſeveral growths of the ſpirits he had to deal with in this matter? Nothing leſs. He had declared plainly the matter as it was, had ſaid enough to ſatisfy fully every meek, and peaceable ſpirit (as the ſpirit of God is queſtionleſs in all its growths.<note place="margin">v. 16.</note>) <hi>And if any man ſeem to be contentious,</hi> ſays he, (as he muſt needs do, that will ſtill oppoſe, and pretend ſcruple; univerſal cuſtome, and practice muſt ſilence him whom Reaſon cannot) <hi>we have no ſuch cuſtome, nor the Churches of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence then it will appear; Firſt, wherein this weakneſs is allowable, and to be born with: and Secondly, how long. Firſt, not in diſobedience to any practical law of Chriſt. <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt depart from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> The weakeſt, and moſt infant Chriſtian that names but that holy name, and profeſſes himſelf a Diſciple of that Maſter, muſt frame his actions in ſome kind of equity, and agreeableneſs to the law of his Maſter. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the great indulger of his brothers weakneſs, is yet ſufficiently ſevere againſt all offenders in this matter.

And the reaſon is, becauſe theſe Laws being imprinted in our very nature, and a part of our ſelves, are onely reduced, and brought back by Chriſtianity, and recover'd from thoſe blots, and ſtains which were caſt upon them by our ſins, and the contrary cuſtoms of a wicked world. And therefore all ignorance, and ſcruple here, gains no more benefit of Toleration than in Heatheniſm it did. Whereas ſeveral <hi>Credenda</hi> there are, and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal verities, which as they are not ſo plainly, and expreſly laid down, but they muſt be drawn out by referring to ſeveral and diſtant places of Scripture, and therefore not diſcernible at one view: So when they are preſented to us, there are ſcarce any foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, or former impreſſions of them on our ſpirits to work their admittance. Many of them being above reaſon, and the reach of a man's underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Which therefore God is pleaſed to ſink into us by degrees, not to preſs them upon us in groſs, but here a little, and there a little, as we are able to bear them. Humane reaſon being the ſame to us, as the Law was to the <hi>Jews.</hi>

                  </note> Both written by the Finger of God: neither of them contrary; yet both much weaker, and far inferiour to the Doctrine of Chriſt. And therefore, though there might be ſome time of Indulgence upon that account, as the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> law was allow'd of for ſome years: Yet this onely till the ſame Authority could be made known for the one, as for the other: That the God of our reaſon is he who does require us to an aſſent of theſe things above our reaſon, and then our reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes inſtantly engaged in the work. All excuſes are taken away, and it is moſt unreaſonable not to aſſent to them. He that is a <hi>Jew</hi> ſtill is not to be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52863:14"/>
look'd upon as a weak Brother. And after God by his Church has declared, and ſet forth theſe Doctrines for ſo long together; we that live in the Fifteenth, or Sixteenth Century, can be little benefited by the pleading of Ignorance. For the time we ought to be Teachers; and thereby the Church is fully impower'd to exact, and require them of us.</p>
               <p>And ſo in the form, and manner of our worſhip, Weakneſs will be of no force againſt Cuſtome uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal. When the decency of our Ceremonies is ſo plainly viſible to all; the innocency of them ſo fully vindicated; the abſolute indifferency of them in themſelves ſo loudly profeſs'd, and acknowledged by the Church: Whereby all fear of Superſtition (as they call it) or placing a Holineſs in them is quite taken away. He that ſtill quarrels at our worſhip, does not quarrel at it, but at the Church; ſhews himſelf contentious; and muſt not by ſo doing acquit himſelf in the leaſt from the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. Much leſs, when all theſe exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Doctrines, and Worſhip, do not own their original from Ignorance and Weakneſs (which might colour for an excuſe) but profeſſedly from a greater Knowledge, and ſtronger eſtate in Chriſtanity. For upon that account it is that they are rejected now, and laid aſide, and an Extraordinary warrant, and an extraordinary ſpirit, brought up in the ſtead of them.</p>
               <p>And as to the building, and maintaining of <hi>Babel</hi> which you object, I ſhall onely ask, whether ſetting men looſe from all Laws, and Religion, be not a fairer groundwork for <hi>Babel, i. e.</hi> Confuſion; than by drawing men into a Communion, with one mind, and with one mouth to glorify the God of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52863:15"/>
our Fathers? The extraordinary ſpirit in Chriſt was to gather together into one as many as were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd abroad. The extraordinary ſpirit in the time of the Apoſtles had no other end but this in it; To plant a Church, to preſcribe Laws, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate Communions: And therefore was it ſelf ſubject to the laws it had preſcribed. The ſpirit of the Prophets is ſubject to the Prophets. How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary then, or extravagant rather, ſhall we call this ſpirit of yours, from the ſpirit of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, whoſe work it is onely to diſſolve, and to deſtroy Communions; to ſet every man by himſelf; to profeſs a ſpirit of Independency, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubjection to the ſpirit of the Prophets; to cry down laws, and all preſcribed worſhip, not becauſe they are bad, but becauſe they are laws, becauſe they are preſcribed? And upon that one head, <hi>viz.</hi> The obliging men to ſome certain meaſures of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and Worſhip, fathering (as you do) all the ignorance and formality that is found in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.3.</note> Whereto therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Charge to men that they teach no other Doctrine: And ſo in his ordering the Chriſtian men of <hi>Corinth</hi> to be bareheaded in their Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (For what is this but obliging men to ſome certain meaſures of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and Worſhip?) muſt be thought in the firſt place, and moſt fouly acceſſary.</p>
               <p>That ſome Churches have indeed taken advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from hence to dogmatize, teaching for Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines the Commandments of men, afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling them into their very Worſhip, will no more take away the power of the Church, in laying this obligation, and the neceſſary good which does ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ariſe from it: than Civil Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

ſome Fathers, or ſome Sovereign Rulers do enact unjuſt, and inconvenient laws; we ſhould preſently diſclaim all Sonſhip, and ſubjection; and revenge this miſcarriage of theirs upon all of the ſame rank, and dominion, how guiltleſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſoever: By declaiming againſt Government; reviling of Order; ſetting it up as the mark for our <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and even naming it Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which yet both by God, and Man, it is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and expreſly deſigned againſt. Without a Corporation, and embodying together in the State, we have no ſecurity of our lives. And without a Communion, and conſent in the Church; without a confeſſed obligation, to ſome certain meaſures of Doctrines and Worſhip; we can have no hope that Religion will be long-liv'd among us. When this Obligation, the Staff of Bands, is once broken; The Church, and Religion (which yet had laſted for ſome time without the Staff of Beauty, as we may obſerve in the eleventh Chapter of <hi>Zachary</hi>) ſtreight falls to the ground. What other can me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect here, where the onely Prop lent to ſuſtain it is, inſtead of a ſtaff, a reed; the Old Teſtament ſpirit; which <hi>eo nomine,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues againſt it by name, will preſently expire.<note place="margin">Heb. 8.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Now that which decayeth, and waxeth old, is ready to vaniſh away.</hi> And none ſooner than this particular ſpirit wherein you inſtance, the ſpirit of <hi>Jael.</hi> Which of all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances in the Old Teſtament puts the faireſt for <hi>Babel</hi>; and enclines moſt (in the way you urge it) to ruine, and confuſion; as being utterly deſtructive to all ſociety, and commerce; to all manner of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and accord in Civil, or Sacred employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For that ſpirit being ſuppoſable onely, ſince
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52863:16"/>
we are ſo loudly declared already <hi>Siſera</hi>'s, and <hi>Canaanites,</hi> I demand with what manner of truſt can we rely upon your promiſes, and invitations; upon your acts, and articles? When we are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by theſe into ſleep, and ſecurity; the ſpirit of <hi>Jael</hi> comes upon you, and the nail is driven into our temples.</p>
               <p>And if this be enough to ſuperſede the Old ſpirit from being of force among us; I ſhall need add but little to what I have already ſaid to juſtify the New from ever countenancing, or giving encouragement to ſuch actions. For you cannot but ſee, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the ſpirit of Chriſt in the Goſpel has reveal'd to us Precepts quite contrary to any ſuch practice. We have an Adminiſtration there that does wholly ſentenſe, and condemn this kind of doing: A ſpirit that is abſolutely oppoſed to any ſuch ſpirit. And if we or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other doctrine (the Scripture has ſaid it) let him be accurſed. And then conſider, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.8.</note> that place of St. <hi>Paul. Let us doe evil, that good may come, whoſe Damnation is juſt.</hi> And if for the abounding of God's Grace we are not to continue in ſin (which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtartles at, and caſts from him, you may remember, with a <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>If it be ſtill urg'd; That, though to continue in ſin were indeed damnable upon any terms; yet that where ſuch a ſpirit, or principle leads us on to the work, there can be no continuance in ſin, what ways, and ſteps ſoever we tread in for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of it. Why then this (it muſt be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) does quite enervate St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſuppoſition, who ſuppoſes us led by ſuch a gracious ſpirit; mov'd merely by our love, and zeal to the glory of God in the greater manifeſtation of his Grace; and yet ſtill to continue, and go on in our ſin. Which then, and though upon this brave deſign, is ſo far from excuſing, or leſſening our ſin, that it makes it indeed out of meaſure ſinfull. As whereby we abuſe that good Spirit to patronize villany; couple together light, and darkneſs; Chriſt, and <hi>Belial.</hi> And therefore the anſwer in ſhort is this. That 'tis not the ſpirit of God that chalks out theſe ways: But in what holy pretenſions, or ſheeps cloathing ſoever it may appear unto us, which ſhall be ſo well counterfeited in the ſpirit, or principle, <hi>Satan</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himſelf into an Angel of Light, as really to deceive all our ſenſes, not at all to be diſcerned, or diſtinguiſhed by us, onely by the ways it puts us upon, and prompts us to. By the fruits ye ſhall know it. Which fruits, you ſee, and ſinfull courſes, and ways, would be no diſtinguiſhing character, and evidence of a falſe, and evil ſpirit, if (as you ſuppoſe) it might at ſome time be the very way,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52863:17"/>
and fruit of the good Spirit of God. And therefore, how much ſafer is it, when ſuch ways, and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines occur to us; when we meet with ſuch kind of practices, and ſuch kind of profeſſours in the World, not to think our ſelves concern'd in charity to them to blaſpheme the Holy Ghoſt, and to torture the Spirit of God (how obſolete, and out dated ſoever) that it may poſſibly whiſper ſuch a meaning? But rather, <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches</hi>: Not what it whiſpers in private to <hi>Jael</hi>; but what it ſays, and ſpeaks out unto the Churches. <hi>Now the Spirit ſpeaketh expreſly,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>All the drift of that Inſtance, ſay you, was but to ſhew that the people of God now (or ſome few of them) may poſſibly have the ſame extraordinary warrant againſt this <hi>Babel,</hi> as thoſe of Old had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that, and againſt the <hi>Canaanites</hi> before. And truely if that were all intended by it, then <hi>Jael,</hi> I muſt needs ſay, was ſomewhat unluckily choſen. Your agreement with her in Lying, and Treachery, being ſo very viſible, and above board, which is indeed the very life of your cauſe, eſpecially to be preſerved, and ſupported by you; and wherein onely ſhe could be pitch'd upon as a particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for your turn; different from <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Who as they lie more open, and obvious to your view in the Book of God: So are all, and every one of them no leſs proper inſtances (to be ſure) for the extraordinary warrant you ſpeak of, than <hi>Jael</hi> could ever be imagined to be. But taking it as you now ſet it; and ſo ſhuffling up <hi>Jael</hi> in common with the reſt. It ſhews, ſay you, That the people of God now, or ſome few of them may poſſibly have the ſame extraordinary warrant againſt this <hi>Babel,</hi> as thoſe of Old had againſt the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> If it ſhews onely that they may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have it: Then it ſhews that it is more probable
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52863:18"/>
they have it not. The extraordinary warrant would ceaſe to be extraordinary, if in the like caſes it were not general, and ordinary to be otherwiſe. And therefore how little encouragement have we from hence to preſume, or engage upon it? This is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſs'd in the pleading an extraordinary war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; that whoſoever is ſav'd in ſo doing, it muſt be merely by a very unheard of, and extraordinary way.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, How does this extraordinary war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant againſt the <hi>Canaanites</hi> ſhew, that there may now be poſſibly the ſame extraordinary warrant againſt us? As if one ſhould argue; Becauſe the World was once drowned, therefore there may poſſibly be a Deluge again. Shall not the word of God lay a ſufficient bar, and impoſibility againſt the Deluge? And does not Chriſt give us a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, a ſufficient warrant againſt this Warrant, in that he gives us Laws, and Precepts to the contrary? Diſclaims any ſuch extraordinary warrant in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.4.</note> And has cenſured it by his Holy Spirit, as the effects merely of Pride, and Ignorance in any that ſhall now pretend unto it?</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, How if <hi>Iſraels</hi> warrant againſt <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> was not ſo very extraordinary? If <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a right to <hi>Canaan</hi> foregoing the warrant; then the warrant was not in this reſpect extraordinary, or creative of a right where there was none: And therefore cannot be thought to ſhew any thing in your caſe.<note place="margin">

Spirit of God hates, and diſavows. Whereas the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (if they had not a former right, yet) having no former tye of ſubjection, or Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to <hi>Canaan</hi>; here was room left for the Spirit of God to beſtow it upon them, as having no ſacred bond: that is to ſay, They not being tied up before by the Spirit of God againſt it. Which when once they are; As particularly by their Oath to the <hi>Gibeonites</hi>: though theſe <hi>Gibeonites</hi> were formerly within their Charter, or Commiſſion; and though this Oath was wreſted from them by guile (as you pretend once Kings were at the peoples diſpoſing; and theſe Oaths of Supremacy, and Allegiance wreſted from the people by mere encroachments) yet then they are ſo faſt tied, as no former donation on God's part to them (which certainly is equal at leaſt to your miſtaken prophecies) nor no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and advantages they had afterwards againſt them (which were as great every day, as you have againſt us at this day; and which are the onely ground whereon you build your diſpenſation) could diſpenſe with it. But the violation of this Oath taken by the Fathers in the days of <hi>Joſhua</hi> (ſo jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and tender is God of his honour in the matter of Oaths; ſo ſevere an Avenger againſt them that falſify his Name) is puniſhed upon the Children of the Third, or Fourth generation, in the days of <hi>David.</hi> And therefore, however you might pretend perhaps an extraordinary warrant dormant from God againſt <hi>Spain</hi>; and in your preſent expedition to the <hi>Indies</hi>; if the ill ſucceſs has not already can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd it: Yet, (bleſſed be God) there cannot be here ſo much as a pretence; in that you are already tied up by God againſt it: that is to ſay, Under the

Onely you of all others could not be lawfully the authours, or inſtruments of his change.

For that is the force, or meaning of the words put interrogatively, or by way of Queſtion, to put it out of Queſtion. Shall he eſcape that does ſuch things?

Truely, that <hi>De futuro</hi> it is to be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, I conceive, is not over plain.

But to give you ſcope here likewiſe, and grant that <hi>Babel</hi> remains yet to be deſtroyed: What paſſages are thoſe in the Revelation which give you ſo plainly the length of the weapon too?

bringing Chriſtianity into the world. And why then for the ſpreading, and growth of it? And being expreſly, and profeſſedly diſclaimed in the beginning, how comes it now to be ſo pious, and neceſſary in the concluſion?<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.4.</note>

               <p>The <hi>Babel</hi> to be deſtroyed is a ſpiritual Kingdom; not the perſons of wicked men, but their luſts, and ſpiritual fornications: the Heatheniſm, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not the Empire, or Emperours, of it. The evil principles, ſay you, both in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Spirituals, and Civils, which ruled moſt eminently in it. Which being ſpiritual, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhotfree; falls not under the reach, or power of a material ſword to be wounded by it. And therefore when we reade ſome expreſſions in the Revelation ſounding generally this way: as of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and killing, and the like, we muſt remember that this Book is a Prophecy; and ſo written in a Prophetical ſtyle. Wherein Chriſt's Victory over the hearts, and ſpirits of men is ordinarily deſcrib'd in thoſe military terms; and as making uſe of ſuch engines, and inſtruments, as Kings and Captains are wont to doe in the management of their wars.</p>
               <p>But to retrench all this too; and ſuppoſing it plainly, and downright in a warlike way: yet why muſt this be done by the people of God? (For
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52863:22"/>
ſo the people, I preſume, you mean in oppoſition to Princes, and Governours; elſe it ſerves not at all to your purpoſe) Whenas yet the ten Horns in the 17<hi>th</hi> Chapter of the Revelation, and 16<hi>th</hi> verſe, who are manifeſtly ſaid to be ten Kings, in the 12<hi>th</hi> verſe of that Chapter, <hi>are thoſe that ſhall hate the Whore, and make her deſolate, and naked, &amp;c.</hi> And ſurely, Sir, I dare be poſitive in this, whatever ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the reſt, That no Prophecy, or prediction in the whole Bible can ſecure ſubjects, and private perſons, much leſs oblige them to ſuch a war.</p>
               <p>And herein 'twill be worth your while to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>David</hi>'s caſe; and obſerve the judgment he makes upon it.

But <hi>David</hi> ſtill ſhifting, and flying for his life, takes ſanctuary at laſt in the ſides of a Cave. Whither <hi>Saul,</hi> being in his march after him, by chance turns aſide from his Army, for the eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Nature, and ſo falls ſingly and unawares into <hi>David</hi>'s hands. But <hi>David,</hi> and his Men, being all this while unſeen, or unperceiv'd by him, were in Conſultation what they had now to doe. <hi>David</hi> was deſign'd by God, and anointed to the Kingdom; moſt unjuſtly perſecuted, and hunted, as a Partridge upon the Mountains, by this very <hi>Saul,</hi> who is now in his hands. So far from a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52863:22"/>
Crown, which yet God had promiſed him, that as long as <hi>Saul</hi> liv'd and at liberty, he could not but be every day in eminent peril of death: To which he might hereafter be thought acceſſary himſelf; as likewiſe of the fruſtrating God's promiſe to him concerning the Kingdom, if he ſhould let ſlip this preſent advantage; and regardleſs of this ſignal providence of God in bringing <hi>Saul</hi> ſo ſtrangely and unexpectedly into his hands, ſhould ſuffer him to eſcape. And to this purpoſe his Officers mind him how this wonderfull piece of providence was exactly in anſwer to a former Prophecy. Wherein God had promiſed to bring <hi>David</hi>'s enemy into his hand, that he might doe to him what ſeemed good unto him. But all theſe arguments how fair and demonſtrative ſoever they might ſeem to others, <hi>David</hi> eaſily diſcerns to be fallacious. God's anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to the Crown did not diſpence with him from obedience to his Commands; or privilege him therefore to be his own Carver. He that ſpake it had ways enough of bringing it about; though <hi>David</hi> continued ſtill in his integrity. He ſhall one day deſcend into the Battel, ſays <hi>David,</hi> and periſh. Wickedneſs proceedeth from the wicked, but my hand ſhall not be upon him. Though <hi>Saul</hi> be injurious towards him, and forget his duty as a King in perſecuting, and purſuing the bloud of an innocent Subject, whom he ought rather to protect, and defend: Yet this will give <hi>David</hi> no advantage of renouncing his Allegiance, or riſing up againſt the life of his Sovereign. And therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy (if <hi>Saul</hi> be the enemy intended in it) is yet no command; nor carries any the leaſt ſhadow of allowance, or diſpenſation with it, to doe what is evil
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52863:23"/>
in God's Eyes. Whereby it will be apparent that this great providence of God in the fulfilling, and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Prophecy, and bringing <hi>Saul</hi> into his hands, was but for a greater trial, which God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make of his Faith, and Loyalty; to tempt, and prove him (as he did <hi>Abraham</hi> before) whether he would make uſe of any indirect courſe for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about pious, and religious ends. Or whether, as he had received the promiſe of the Kingdom from God's mere favour to him, he could now rely, and reſt himſelf wholly upon his power, and wiſedom, even againſt all the ſeeming difficulties, and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities of fleſh, and bloud, for the enſtating it upon him. Wherein he ſo piouſly acquits himſelf, as notwithſtanding the Prophecy they mention to him, and this Providence before his eyes, together with that carnal prudence, which was queſtionleſs ſuggeſted to him; he lets <hi>Saul</hi> eſcape. Not onely refuſes to be his judge, not onely abſents himſelf from the ſentence, and execution; but urges, and pleads, and perſuades with his Men not to meddle with him. <hi>Who can ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lord's anointed and be guiltleſs?</hi> Thus ſubduing the Kingdom, and obtaining the promiſe by Faith (as it is witneſſed of him) while he ſeems to undoe all;<note place="margin">Heb. 11.33.</note> to fruſtrate the promiſe, and forfeit his claim to the Kingdom for God's ſake, or rather, than be guilty of ſin in the procuring of it.</p>
               <p>And now let us look back a while; and put your caſe in the ſame balance with <hi>David</hi>'s; and ſee if you fall not ſo much ſhort of him in the premiſſes, as you have wickedly out-dar'd, and out-done him in the Concluſion. <hi>David</hi> was elected by God, and actually anointed by his holy
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52863:23"/>
Prophet to the Kingdom. You were tied up under the Oath of God againſt it: So far from any lawfull poſſibility of taking the Kingdom to your ſelves, as you were obliged with life, and limb to prevent the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and Conſpiracies of any other; and to ſecure it to the King, and his Heirs after him for ever. <hi>David</hi> was an innocent injur'd perſon; one that by <hi>Saul</hi>'s appointment had done moſt eminent, and almoſt miraculous ſervice againſt his enemies; beſide many perſonal, and particular obligations to <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf. In reward whereof he is now bloudily purſued by <hi>Saul,</hi> and all the power of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to take away his life. Whereas you, after many conceſſions, and Acts of Grace from the King, drive him away from his own houſe with Tumults, and popular violence; purſue him immediately with an Army; imbitter the minds, and mouths of the people with all the fouleſt, and falſeſt reproaches that could be ſpit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; rob him of his whole revenue; turn the deaf ear to all his deſires of returning; and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly prevent, and fruſtrate his renued meſſages, and petitions (as I may ſo term them) for peace, and accommodation. And then laſtly for the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that ſignal providence of God in bringing the King into your hands; which muſt be thought to ſuperſede all this; and not onely ſo, take away the poiſon, and malignity of this <hi>Coloquintida,</hi> like ſtirring the water with the Unicorns-horn; but baptize all theſe your trayterous, and diſloyal actions, into juſt, and neceſſary, and religious. Nay urge, and engage you farther, Firſt to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and then to Murther your Sovereign (For ſo the following of providence is made the onely <hi>via recta</hi>; and wherewith you as eaſily ſilence, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52863:24"/>
ſwallow up all arguments, and objections brought againſt you; as <hi>Moſes</hi>'s ſerpent did the ſerpents of the Magicians) This caſe of Providence, I ſay, of all other runs wideſt from the parallel; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God did as plainly diſcriminate himſelf to you, and <hi>David</hi>; as <hi>David,</hi> and you have differenc'd, and diſcriminated your ſelves from each other in the contrary uſe, and application of it. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Saul</hi> indeed was brought by God's providence, according to his former promiſe into <hi>David</hi>'s hands, while he had never the leaſt aim, or deſign at any ſuch thing; but always declin'd it, and was now in his flight, lurking here in this Cave merely for fear, and thereby to avoid him who was furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly now upon his March after him. What was there of this, I beſeech you, in your caſe? Nay ſay, if all things were not quite contrary. For beſide your no promiſe, or prophecy for it, how many precepts, and penalties are urged by God againſt it? Beſide your not declining to get the King into your power as <hi>David</hi> did, how many wicked arts, and ſtrategems are put in practice to bring it about? And whereas you might have thought it ſomething of Providence, it may be, to have kill'd the King at random; or to have taken him priſoner in the field, in any one of thoſe great ſucceſſes you had upon his party (though 'tis ſure, Where God is ſhut out of the cauſe, and quarrel; as in that of ſubjects againſt their Sovereign, there can be no pretence at all of his providence in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſuffers to be brought about) yet it is very obſervable; and wherein it would well become you to take notice of God's providence; That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe Oaths of Supremacy, and Allegiance
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52863:24"/>
renued by you at your entrance into the Parliament, or before you could ſit there in any capacity to conſult, and carry on the war againſt him: How did God provide for the King's ſafety; when you your ſelves, even of your ſelves, without the King did engage your ſelves, and the whole Kingdom; Firſt, by a Proteſtation: And Secondly, your ſelves, and your whole party, even without, and againſt the King's conſent, by a Solemn Vow, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, never to be forgotten, to defend, and preſerve his Perſon, and Honour? And when all this could not get him into your hands, how did God provide for the King again? when all his party being ſlain generally, and faln into your hands, He yet carries him into the <hi>Scots</hi> army; where you could not compaſs him at laſt but by freſh Engagements of ſafety, and honour to his Perſon? Nor is he yet in your hands; your hands I mean of the Army, who pretended at laſt to have power over him (of which no other account can be given, I think, than that of Providence) till by new Treaſons, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions you had plainly acknowledged the depth, and deſperateneſs of your former villany. And by riſing up againſt your own Maſters, and violently ſnatching the King from them once at <hi>Holmeby,</hi> and again at the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> (by whoſe authority, and Commiſſion onely you were put into arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and whereby you did ſeem, and ſeek to excuſe your ſelves from the crime of Rebellion in ſo doing) you did thereby manifeſtly accuſe, and condemn your ſelves for it. So that nothing hardly, I may ſay, was ever permitted by God, that was more fully, and ſufficiently provided againſt by him. Who in farther care of the King's ſafety, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52863:25"/>
preſervation (beſides the many ſeveral and plain Laws both Humane and Divine, and your own voluntary wilfull Oaths to this purpoſe) yet leſt he ſhould fall into your hands, the barbarous bloudy hands of the Army, God did damm up the way againſt it by a complication of Treaſons mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually accuſing, and bearing witneſs againſt each other (whereby the King was yet as ſafe from falling into your hands, as it was certain you would not condemn your ſelves) For thus your firſt riſing up againſt the King under the authority of the two houſes, muſt plainly condemn your diſobedience, and Inſurrection afterwards againſt them. And your riſing up againſt the two Houſes afterwards leaves your former Rebellion againſt the King without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. And if this muſt be ſtill called providence, 'twill certainly be in this; That, In your ſeizing at laſt upon the King, God has brought you to condemn your ſelves, and waſh off with your own hands that <hi>fucus,</hi> and paint of a ſupreme authority in the houſes, wherewith you did formerly colour your Rebellion againſt the King; and ſhelter it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen, and diſcover'd by the people.</p>
               <p>But then this kind of Providence ſure will be far enough from engaging you to that horrid perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration which pretends to derive from it. And if <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (who had he diſpatched <hi>Saul</hi> out of the way, had been inſtantly rightfull King, as being the next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Heir) could yet find no ſuch conſtruction to be made poſſibly of that eminent providence, wherein it pleaſed God to appear to him: I can never ſufficiently wonder at the quickſightedneſs of theſe men, who from a permiſſion onely to which they have waded in bloud; and wreſted from God
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52863:25"/>
by deſperate impenitent provocations) of getting the King into their hands, ſhould ſpy out at this vaſt diſtance an evident call to Power, and Sovereignty, in themſelves, by taking away his life; and thereby an Obligation upon them for ſo doing. <hi>David,</hi> who had a right to the Crown dares not yet poſſeſs himſelf of it by this Act; which theſe men look upon as ſo meritorious, that the very committing of this Act muſt be rewarded upon them by God with Crowns, and Sceptres, and Kingdoms; and create them a right out of their former Nothing. Whereas no Robbery, or Murther upon the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but has a much better title to Providence. And I ſhould hugely condemn the <hi>Laodicean</hi> temper of that Souldier, who after this ſhould be ſo cold a Chriſtian as not to follow Providence in cutting the throat of every one that falls into his hands. Good Sir, <hi>Secret things belong unto the Lord:</hi>

                  <hi>but thoſe that are revealed, unto us and to our Children for ever.</hi> And whatever God pleaſes to permit for our tryals; we have yet a ſure word of prophecy to guide us in our practice. <hi>Whereto we ſhould doe well to take heed,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>as unto a light ſhining in a dark place.</hi> And whereby <hi>David,</hi> you ſee, in the darkneſs, and opportunity of the Cave, was yet directed not to quench the light of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; or ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lord's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed.</p>
               <p>But this whole inſtance of <hi>David,</hi> though exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſo great a length, will eaſily be voided by you, I perceive. While granting a difference indeed between your ſelves, and <hi>David</hi>; and ſo in the ways of God's Providence towards you, and him, which I ſo much urge, and ſo clearly demonſtrate:

There is yet a third difference you will reply, which I have ſaid nothing of; and wherein the advantage lies on your ſide, to ſo great a degree as will fetch up the other ſcale, and make all even. And how contrary ſoever your actions were, his in ſaving, and yours in deſtroying: Yet the vaſt difference of the ſubject matter whereon you wrought will eaſily reconcile them, and allow them both to be Religious.

               <p>I need not be told that theſe two Inſtances of our Saviour's concerning ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s ſeat, and entring by the door into the ſheepfold, are applyed by him to the Paſtours, and Fathers of the Church; and not to the Civil Magiſtrate or Father of the Countrey.<note place="margin">

For then we ſhould not have taken liberty from the perſonal failings, and pretended doctrinal errours (which were much more viſible, and notorious in the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi>) of our former authorized Teachers the Biſhops, and Clergy of this land who ſit as demonſtrably in the Throne of the Apoſtles, and by due Ordination ſucceſſively from them; as the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> of Chriſt's time in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s ſeat, to renounce them, and caſt them off. So nor ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52863:27"/>
ſhould we be ſo far infatuated as to hearken after theſe our upſtart Teachers, and intruding Rabbies, who having no lawfull call, or entrance into the paſtoral charge, which they poſſeſs, not coming in by the door; plainly diſcover themſelves for Thieves and Robbers. But notwithſtanding the occaſion of our Saviour's words in this place was indeed proper, and particular, (as no wiſe man ſpeaks at random) yet the deſign, and force of them is general; manifeſtly reaching at all Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be ſubmitted to, if lawfully deſcending; though upon wicked, and unjuſt Rulers ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s ſeat. So on the otherſide to be oppoſed, and rejected; not to be lookt upon as the authority of Rulers; but as the force, and outrage of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers when uſurpt by violent, and unlawfull ways.</p>
               <p>Thus while <hi>David</hi> bears ſtill an awefull reverence, and reſpect to <hi>Saul,</hi> bloudy, and Tyrannical <hi>Saul,</hi> even after <hi>Saul</hi>'s diſobedience againſt God, and God's repenting that he had made <hi>Saul</hi> King; after God's good Spirit had forſaken him, and he was now poſſeſſed, and actuated by an evil ſpirit (which might have made up at leaſt as great a noiſe, and accuſation as Evil Councellours! did amongſt us) Nay after he had ſo far hearkn'd, and was led by it, as to make ſeveral attempts againſt <hi>David</hi>'s life; and actually to deſtroy, without any proceſs at all, a whole City of God's Prieſts in the higheſt degree of rage, and inhumanity that has been heard of. For ſo it muſt be obſerv'd that <hi>David</hi>'s tenderneſs, and reſpect to <hi>Saul</hi> in the Cave, was after he had been guilty of all this. As this, I ſay, gives a full proof of Reverence, and Obedience to Sovereign Power if lawfully ſeated, though in a cruel, and unjuſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52863:28"/>
perſon ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s ſeat: So on the other ſide we have as clear a proof,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 23.</note> in the hiſtory of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> how little right goes along with poſſeſſion; what obedience is due to the commands, or reſpect to the perſons of ſuch Uſurpers. For that <hi>Athaliah</hi> having by Murther of the ſeed Royal made her way unto the Throne, and continued her poſſeſſion ſix years (longer than our new Maſter can yet pretend to) is at length, without any ſcruple at all, dethroned, and diſpoſſeſs'd, and executed by good <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the High Prieſt, in the right of young <hi>Joaſh,</hi> who alone had eſcaped the Axe of all the King's Sons; and appears now to make his claim, and challenge of the Crown. Thus bloudy <hi>Saul,</hi> yet ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s ſeat, and lawfull Sovereignty, is honoured and rever'd by the holy prophet <hi>David.</hi> And <hi>Athaliah,</hi> though poſſeſſed of the ſame ſeat, and ſovereignty; yet becauſe in another's wrong; becauſe her entrance into it was not by the door, or lawfull way; but ſhe had climb'd into it by Treaſon, and Rebellion, and Bloud, is therefore deſpiſed, and deſtroyed by the High Prieſt <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiada.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I forbear purpoſely the many advantages laid before me in the Copy, or counterpart of this Story: How <hi>Athaliah</hi>'s right, as Queen Mother, might better colour for Sovereignty; than if ſhe had been, as ours, of the loweſt, and meaneſt of the people. And ſure the luſtre, and excellency of our late King needs not the ſoil of a bloudy <hi>Saul</hi> to ſet him off. But becauſe your exceptions lie not at all againſt the King (who was wont to bear the load, and envy of all your former Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations) but againſt the Kingdom it ſelf; that

very form, and conſtitution of Government whereby He was King, and we ſubjects, terming it <hi>Babel,</hi> and ſo to be deſtroyed. Thither likewiſe I direct my diſcourſe.

               <p>For firſt, The <hi>Medium</hi> whereby you would prove us <hi>Babylon, viz.</hi> From that implicit obedience we profeſs, and acknowledge to the King, does immediately reach at God himſelf; make him a <hi>Babylonian</hi> too; both as the authour of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general, and of this particular way of Government ſet up, and eſtabliſhed in our land. For every Government, that is truely ſo, does neceſſarily ſuppoſe an irreſiſtibility ſome where, either in one, or more perſons to make it a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and diſtinguiſh it from confuſion. Which is all we mean I am ſure, or that you would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon us, I think, by implicit Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> either actively to obey his Majeſty's juſt, and legal commands; or when they prove illegal, and unjuſt, patiently to bear the penalty annexed, rather than reſiſt, and riſe up againſt him. And that this is neceſſary to all Governments; and fit, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that we ſhould be thus governed, I will now demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>For Government being the orderly framing, and ſquaring of many ſingle, and divided perſons into one Body: there muſt neceſſarily be in every Government ſome common point of Unity wherein
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52863:29"/>
they muſt all concentre, and meet, and become One. Some laſt appeal, and determination to which they muſt all ſubmit; and from whence the Government takes its name, and denomination, either of Popular, or Democratical, if the laſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal be to the people: of Ariſtocratical, if to a Counſel of State: of Regal, or Monarchical, if to One perſon. And the ſuppoſing a liberty left us to reject and reſiſt againſt any ſuch determination, when it is, or is apprehended by us, unjuſt, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient (This being the very end, and eſſence of Governours, as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <hi>That we may lead peaceable, and quiet lives.</hi> Who muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſarily have <hi>Jus gladii,</hi> the Power of the ſword, whereby to furniſh them for this end. They, and none but They, and ſo are irreſiſtible) does plainly mutilate, and Null the Government; diſſolve the Body; and leave us, as we were, ſingle, and divided Perſons. <hi>Non jam aedes, ſed cumulus exit.</hi> We may be a heap indeed; but not a houſe, not a building, not a Body. For no Body can be legally, and naturally at variance with its ſelf. This being that which diſtinguiſhes one Body, and ſo one Government, from another: <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Spain, Spain</hi> from <hi>France, &amp;c.</hi> And to ſay, That in every Government the people are ſtill the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Judges, and Arbitratours, is to ſay One of theſe Two: Either that there is no other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but Popular; or that Order, and Government is the very ſame thing with Ataxie, and Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For as in a Popular ſtate, it were perfectly unlawfull, and the mother of Confuſion, to follow one Prince-ringleader, or ſome few of the Nobles, in oppoſition to the Major part of the People: So
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52863:29"/>
it is the ſame thing in a Monarchy or Kingdom (to be ſure) upon the peoples account more, or leſs, to riſe up, and rebell againſt the King.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, that in either ſtate I am not to obey an unjuſt command. Herein I am already prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, and prevented by God. But this is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing of the Sovreignty of our Rulers, which muſt onely be acknowledged under God. And while I reſerve to execute, or actively obey them in ſin, I ſtill preſerve my fidelity to God, diſavow my ſelf the ſervant of men. And yet by ſubmitting to the penalty, I preſerve the end, and deſign of Government, <hi>viz.</hi> peaceable, and quiet living: and ſet the Governours upon their proper Thrones <hi>Solo Deo minores.</hi> All which is overthrown by reſiſtence. The Governours diſplac'd by ſetting my ſelf above them; or at leaſt in an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and equality with them; which is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuppoſed in reſiſtence, Government caſheir'd, and render'd inffectual.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Jews</hi> when in oppoſition to Chriſt they were very zealous for the honour of their Maſter <hi>Moſes,</hi> and their own freedom, for that they were freeborn (never were in bondage, ſay they, to any man) did therein eſpecially diſhonour <hi>Moſes,</hi> and enſlave themſelves. So we make our ſelves purely the ſlaves, and ſervants of men, by engaging with them in an unlawfull reſiſtence, though in pretence of our liberty. And never more highly deny, and diſhonour Chriſt, than when in this kind of way we pretend moſt to his honour, and ſervice: by deſpiſing that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and theſe Governours, whom God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as I may ſo ſay) has ſanctifyed, and ſent
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52863:30"/>
into the world. For ſo Government, and Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracy were abſolutely erected by God in the firſt Creation, giving the Sovreignty to Mankind over the reſt of his workmanſhip. And again, in the diſtinction, and differencing of Sexes, Man had the Sovreignty over the Woman determin'd upon him by his primogeniture, or being firſt formed, as the Apoſtle argues.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.13.</note> 
                  <hi>For Adam was firſt formed then Eve</hi>: And ſo manifeſtly before the fall, and no miſhapen piece of corrupt Nature. And again, in the production, and procreation of Children, the Parents had a Sovreignty, and Dominion over thoſe that were begotten by them. Which how limited, and confin'd ſoever it were (for that it ſeems all this while not to reach unto life: The power of Life, and Death being reſerved in God's hand, and as his peculiar) was yet certainly in every Species of it ſacred, and irreſiſtible to thoſe that were under it.</p>
               <p>And now when after the Floud, which came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Old world for their ſins, and becauſe there was no Magiſtrate effectually to curb them, and cut them off (admonitions, and ſtripes, the family diſcipline, being much too gentle to reſtrain their violence) it pleaſed God in prevention of the like for the time to come, as he aſſured by a Rainbow to enlarge the Commiſſion even over the Life; and to the ſhedding the bloud of a capital offender. <hi>Whoſoever ſheddeth mans bloud,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 9.6.</note> 
                  <hi>by man ſhall his bloud be ſhed.</hi> Yet this was ſtill <hi>Salvo regimine</hi> without any power lawfully in the People either to riſe up againſt him, when he did ſo; or to ſit in Judgment againſt him, when he neglected to doe ſo; and from a Judge ſhould debaſe himſelf
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52863:30"/>
into a Malefactour. This appears evidently by the words, and Tenure of his Commiſſion. For as the Magiſtrates power over life, and death, is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all in theſe words: So his impunity likewiſe as to the People (though he ſhould be <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius criminis,</hi> and guilty of the ſame Crime) will eaſily be deriv'd from the ſame Fountain. And, as the Apoſtle argues, that when the Scripture ſays in theſe words, <hi>All things are put under Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.27.</note> 
                  <hi>it is manifeſt that he is excepted, who did put all things under him.</hi> So there is the ſame Reaſon, and <hi>Manifeſto</hi> likewiſe that in theſe words; <hi>Whoſoever ſheddeth mans bloud, by man ſhall his bloud be ſhed</hi>; The avenger of bloud, the man that is to ſhed the bloud of the bloud-ſhedder ſhould abſolutely be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from it. Who elſe muſt be ſuppoſed to be under thoſe whom in that very Term, or Title, he is apparently ſet over. The avenging of their bloud being the plain Enſign of his Sovreignty over them. As the Father in being ſaid to put all things under the Son does therein appear to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him. And therefore how univerſally affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative ſoever the Propoſitions may ſeem to be, <hi>All things are put under Chriſt:</hi> and, <hi>Whoſoever ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth mans bloud, &amp;c.</hi> Yet they are both to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to their proper ſubjects: and ſuch a truce to be held with the Terms, and parts of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <hi>All,</hi> and <hi>Whoſoever,</hi> as not to contradict, and make war againſt the Tenure, and Deſign of the whole. Which being once ſecured, and ſav'd harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; we cannot ſtretch them beyond their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But All things, abſolutely All things are to be put under Chriſt, ſave the Father. And Whoſoever ſheddeth mans bloud, whether Perſon,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52863:31"/>
or People, ſave the Avenger of bloud himſelf; here is ample Authority to cut them off.</p>
               <p>And if this may ſerve for Government in the general; and to evince an irreſiſtibility neceſſarily flowing from the nature, and being of it (the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power in every Oeconomy whatſoever, in that it is the Supreme Power, being not poſſibly lyable to the Inferiour, or ſuch as derive from it) we will ſee next what malignant influence there is in Monarchy: or where this ſupreme power is in one man, as with us by Law it is eſtabliſhed, that ſhould quite overthrow the good of Government; and pervert it (as you complain) into the uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and unſupportableneſs of a <hi>Babylonian</hi> bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. And truely if God might be allowed any ſhare, or proportion of wiſedom but equal to the conceits which we have of our own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, we ſhould not thus haſtily aſſume againſt that Form which he was pleaſed to erect among his own people. Monarchy, even without that contradictory term of Mixt monarchy adjoyned to it, being next to Theocraty (God's own immediate rule) the conſtant ſtanding way deputed by him for <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> As appears plainly by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who from the mouth of God, before the people in likelihood thought of any ſuch thing, though always forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them a conformity with the Nations in ſin; and generally for their greater ſeparation, even in their innocent, and harmleſs cuſtoms: Yet in the way of Government, ſays He, if when ye be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, and gather into a Body, and grow weary to be govern'd as at this day; and make choice rather of that uſage among the Nations (<hi>Inter omnes per circuitum nationes</hi> among all the Nations round about

                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>I put a beautifull Crown, upon thy head, and thou didſt proſper into a Kingdom.</hi> A kingdom, or Monarchy, and that of God's putting on too, was the excellency, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that people, honoured, and commended by him, not onely by thoſe many Worthies whom he raiſed up to this Kingly Office, and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling among them, as <hi>David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Joſiah,</hi> and the reſt: who were certainly none of

               <p>And that this was abſolute Monarchy; or that theſe Kings were ſacred, and inviolable in their perſons (which is all you can charge upon us by the No Power you ſpeak of to bound, or limit our King againſt his will) does appear at large in the ſacred ſtory.

               <p>Thus then the Vizzor being taken off; and no ſuch Antichriſt, as you would fright us with, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under this Form of Monarchical Government, or the King's unlimitted power, as you call it, in Civils. We will next take a view of that implicit Faith in Spirituals; the evil principle, as you ſay, of our Church Government; whereby we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Antichriſts <hi>eo Nomine,</hi> and oppreſſours of God's people.</p>
               <p>And herein give me leave to premiſe, That you have either diſcover'd in your ſelf an Evil eye, and enmity towards our Church, beyond our greateſt adverſaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> by coining a new ſlander, and reproach againſt us, more than ever was hammer'd
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52863:32"/>
in their forge. Or if true, and no ſlander; you have then diſcover'd a monſtrous blindneſs, and ſtupidity in thoſe Eagle-eyed Doctours, who being ſo continually urg'd, and argued, and condemn'd by us for this very principle of implicit Faith (and which is indeed the very characteriſtical difference, and diſtinction between Us, and them) could never yet after all their poring, and diligence, be able to ſpy it in This Church; or to juſtify themſelves by returning it upon Us for Proteſtant doctrine.</p>
               <p>But let us hear your proof, and by what ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and indications you judge of the diſeaſe. By that evil principle, ſay you, which denied any power to be above the Church in the Interpretation of Scripture to a particular mans Conſcience. Truely, Sir, One had need be very far gone in the diſeaſe; and highly infected with the implicit Faith you mention, to believe either the truth of this your Inſtance in one ſenſe; or the weight, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it in another. For if by Church be meant the Church in its whole latitude, and due extent, as it is Catholick, and comprehenſive of all perſons, and all times, then the Apoſtles, and Primitive Saints being likewiſe included under that <hi>Aera</hi>; to ſubmit implicitly to their Doctrines, and conform to their practice Univerſal in point of Diſcipline, will not be of weight to accuſe us.

one Age excluſively to the Firſt, and Pureſt; or of any one particular Place, and Denomination: Then let the Calumny light where it properly belongs. <hi>Romana Eccleſia eſt infallibilis.</hi> The Church of England is endued with more modeſt principles; never attempting to make a new Article of Faith; but carefully preſerving the <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> committed to her truſt, whole, and entire; has out of this extracted onely what ſhe apprehended moſt plainly contained in it, and eſpecially conducing to good life. Which yet, in an humble opinion of her own judgment, ſhe impoſes upon none, as Truths univerſally neceſſary to Salvation; no, nor gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be believed. Onely requires of her Clergy Sons before ſhe entruſts them with the Power of the Keys, and the Government of the Houſe of God: That they would thus far own, and honour Her for their Mother, by teſtifying under their hands; That there is nothing, in ſuch Her Articles, and Enunciations, contrary to the word of God (a rare, and ſingular example of Chriſtian meekneſs, and moderation) leaving in the mean time the reſt of her children free from any perſonal, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar atteſtations. Being abundantly ſatisfied, if (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with her in the main; and wherein ſhe has manifeſtly the expreſs, and explicit Doctrine of the firſt times for her warrant) they behave themſelves in the reſt, as her children in their places, and callings, without diſturbance of publick peace, or ſeduction of others.</p>

enjoyns, would be contented to be a particular man ſtill; not ſubverting her publick Order; or by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing, and diſſembling his private interpretations, make himſelf popular, and tumultuous? And who will have reaſon to complain of this, ſave ſuch, who under the name of Chriſtians, take it ill, that they may not make Goſpel of the Alchoran? Or who can call this Tyranny in our Church, which ſhe would gladly ſubmit to and accept (and that is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to wipe off the Tyranny) from any other? And I dare proclaim it in the name of my Mother the Church of England (though the youngeſt, and very meaneſt of all her children) that if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (with whom ſhe has had the longeſt, and ſharpeſt contention of any) would go no farther as to neceſſary matters of Doctrine, than what was ſo eſteemed, and taught by the Church Primitive; nor ſtretch her diſcipline beyond that pattern; leaving the reſt of her Articles, how true ſoever ſhe may think them, and ſo under that name worthy of all commendations, yet as no neceſſary conditions of her Communion, or of abſolute neceſſity to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: She would then heartily draw together with her in the ſame yoke: And (yielding her the right hand of Fellowſhip, and that Primacy of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and dignity due unto her Biſhop, as being <hi>Primae ſedis Epiſcopus</hi>) carefully maintain the <hi>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But while the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> abſolutely refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any ſuch conditions, and ſcorning to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, does ſtill preſs her new Articles equally to be received, and ſubmitted to, as the old truths of God, and his Church. We have this to anſwer for our ſelves. That it ſeems very unreaſonable
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52863:34"/>
that we in this latter Age of the Church of Chriſt (and ſo at fartheſt diſtance from thoſe times of Miracles, and extraordinary viſible gifts of God's Spirit, in Confirmation or his Truth) ſhould be tied to believe ſo much more, upon ſo much leſs Evidence. And what was left at liberty then to believe, or not to believe (as many Articles of the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> confeſſedly were) ſhould now, without any pretention of new proof, or immediate revelation from Heaven; nay though, in appearance at leaſt, contradicting the manifeſt truths of God, and our own beſt Reaſon; be required of us under pain of Damnation. And while all other Topicks failing them, They heap up teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies from the Fathers in defence of ſuch their additional Articles, accounting them thus (as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> with mouldy bread, and clouted ſhoes) to make us believe that they came from afar, and are of ancient ſtanding in the Church of God. We have apparently this advantage (ſuppoſing we could not drop Fathers with them; if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be not too much convinc'd already to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any ſuch thing) That if any one Father ſay but as we ſay in this point wherein we differ: and another in another: and ſo of the reſt (which an Eaſie Undertaker might be able to produce) we are not prejudic'd at all by the Number againſt us. For that from hence it muſt needs follow; That the contrary to what is ſo aſſerted; or but admitted, as probable, by any one Father; was not then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as an Article of Faith, or of neceſſity to Salvation in the Church of Chriſt. Which yet now they are not content under any inferiour Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and Superſcription, to obtrude upon us. And
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52863:34"/>
have withall ſo weav'd, and mingl'd many of them into their Devotions, as if they delighted to ſtand alone; thereby forcing, and reſtraining all the reſt of the Chriſtian world from their Communion.</p>
               <p>Whereas the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when put to compile a Liturgy; even in Separation, and diſtinction from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by whom ſhe was caſt out, was ſo far from heat, or ſpight, or animoſity; nay ſo full of Charity, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſpirit, not in Word, or in Name onely; which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does ſo much glory in, but in deed, and in truth; that ſhe agrees unanimouſly upon ſuch a Form, as whereby ſhe might gather together into One all that were ſcatter'd abroad; as having nothing in it offenſive, or contrary to the Romaniſt: or ſo ſiding, and agreeing with him, as thereby to diſtaſte the reſt of Chriſtians; but acknowledged, and approved by both.</p>
               <p>And ſurely if the Lord's Prayer, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the Common Prayer of the whole Chriſtian Church, and the very badge, and cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of Chriſt's diſciples, may be allowed to hold its place, and made the pattern of all Church Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, as it ought: that Liturgy muſt needs be acknowledged moſt Chriſtian, and Catholick (as coming neareſt to that Form, and moſt ſuitable to that deſign) not which is moſt particular, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute; but which is moſt comprehenſive, and large; and wherein the ſeveral differences of the heads, and judgments of Chriſtians, are leaſt ſuffered to work a Diviſion upon their Hearts, and Spirits, or come into their Prayers. Which, I muſt take leave again to commend, as the particular Excellency of this Church of Ours, beyond all the Churches
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52863:35"/>
either of the Romaniſt, or Reformed; as having nothing either in the matter, or miniſtration of it to be quarrelled at by either. Whereas the Romaniſt in his matter; and the Reformed in his miniſtery, are mutually at diſtance from each other. But our matter being apparently good, and innocent in both their eſteems: the Romaniſt muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our Miniſtery a lawfull Miniſtery, as being the ſame, and from the ſame Miſſion originally with his own. And ſo the Reformed, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever rejecting Epiſcopacy ſome of them, and the order of Biſhops, which we embrace; yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thoſe, whom they reject as Biſhops, to be truely Prieſts <hi>Veri ſacerdotes,</hi> and ſo to have law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full power of Ordination, and Authorizing others to that Function.</p>
               <p>In a word, neither the Miniſtery, nor Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Church, could ever be made criminous by any Party, or Diviſion of men whatſoever, profeſſing the Name of Chriſt, ſave ſuch of this preſent generation, who together with Ours, reject all Forms, and all Miniſtery: Condemning upon that very account the Lord's Prayer; and arguing againſt any ſet, and diſtinct office of Miniſtery in the Apoſtles. So that our indictment in their mouths runs thus: That not having the fear of God before our eyes, we have ſided with Chriſt in a ſet Form of Prayer; and ſucceeded to the holy Apoſtles in a ſelect, and authorized Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>But to return from whence I have thus largely digreſs'd. You are contented at laſt to ſee, and acknowledge the excellency of Monarchy, and that according to the eſtabliſhment of <hi>England</hi> in an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary way above all other ways, and Forms of Government whatſoever.</p>

               <p>The ſtrongeſt <hi>Babel,</hi> ſay you, that can be devis'd to keep a people from being ſcatter'd into theſe Confuſions, is that Form of abſolute Monarchy, and that in an Hereditary way. Well, let that be ſtood too; and then, however it may be reproached for <hi>Babel</hi> (which it partakes in common with all Government) yet while it is confeſs'd to be the beſt, and ſtrongeſt; the moſt oppoſed to confuſion, and apteſt for Unity, and Peace (to which all Government is deſigned; and upon which the life of the Community doth immediately depend; and wherein every good man's intereſt is eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd) we have little reaſon to look upon them as good Patriots, or good Chriſtians, lovers of Chriſt, or of their Countrey, who unhinged us from this frame, and invited us into ſidings upon pretentions of being better rivited, and united in a popular way.</p>
               <p>But then for the <hi>Babel</hi> which is ſtill affixed to this abſolute Form, as how highly ſoever it pretends, yet falling ſhort of its end; and neceſſarily admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it is ſaid, in ſome caſes thoſe very Ataxies, and Confuſions, we would labour to prevent. <hi>Eſt aliquid prodire tenus.</hi> Surely that ſome caſes onely; one, or two poſſible ſuppoſals (as that wherein you inſtance of the Monarch's being lunatick, or an Idiot) may bring it to this, will caſt no dirt, nor blemiſh at all upon our Building, while it ſtands firm, and fair, being compar'd with other Edifices. Which not onely theſe extraordinary, and prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous events (which like an Earthquake, and general

Inundation of the Sea, may ſeem to bear down all before them; and againſt which men in very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence have not meditated of any fence) but far leſſer force, and more ordinary Occurrences (as of a land-floud, or ſtormy night) levels with the ground.</p>
               <p>That ſome Out-let there is in Monarchy for affairs to run in a Popular, or Parliament chanel, will onely prove it to be of the ſame piece with our ſelves, and to ſuffer <hi>Quid humanum.</hi> There being a mixture perhaps of infirmity, and imperfection in the perfecteſt good we here enjoy.

               <p>Thus far upon your own grounds, and ſuppoſing the miſchief unavoidable in the caſe aſſign'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That conſiedring the King may be either a Fool, or mad, or otherwiſe diſtemper'd, ſo as to command thoſe things which are abſolutely deſtructive to that Society which he is bound to preſerve: there muſt in that caſe be ſome Counſel; or ſome ſingle Perſon
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52863:36"/>
to govern in his ſtead, who muſt alſo judge when he is in ſuch a condition, and not he himſelf. And ſo there muſt be ſomething ſtill like King, and Parliament to give occaſion for the like differences. But that of otherwiſe deſtemper'd ſo as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand things deſtructive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a Clauſe of ſo much latitude, as cannot be ſuppoſed conſiſtent with any Monarchy, much leſs an abſolute one, as we now ſpeak of. For whatever may be ſaid of a mad man, or an Idiot, where the Caſe is evident, and open to all eyes, as the Sun that ſhines; and ſo needs no diſquiſition, nor can be impos'd upon any that really is not ſo. Yet the commands, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies of a Prince, are not ſo diſcernable; but liable to many great miſtakes, and miſconſtructions. And ordinarily ſo much the more, by how much the better they are. And the deeper his counſels are laid, much leſs by them who being as much out of kenn, have yet an Intereſt always bribing them to find fault, and defame his actions, whereby to ſettle themſelves in his Throne, and get the Authority into their own hands.</p>
               <p>Succeſs is that onely which makes any counſels, or proceedings good in the popular eſteem. What ends unluckily, was begun, ſay they, unwarrantably. And he that will be content to have the people for his judge, muſt be ſure to have good fortune his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, and Friend, to plead for him. And then for a ſingle perſon, and ſuppoſing in that Caſe ſuch an One to be appointed the Judge, and to determine upon the actions of his Sovereign, that is ſtill more unreaſonable than the former; as whereby we are conjur'd into a Circle. <hi>Nam, Quis cuſtodiet cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem?</hi> What better ſecurity have we of this Judge;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52863:37"/>
than we had before of the King? Or why may not he be as ruinous, and deſtructive to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in ſuch his ſentence, as the King may be fear'd to be in his deſigns, and Machinations?</p>
               <p>But that which gives a full anſwer to the Caſe propounded, is this. That indeed it needs no anſwer at all; For that it manifeſtly implies a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and ſo can have no poſſibility of truth in it. For to be an abſolute Monarch; and yet to be liable at the ſame time to be dethroned by thoſe over whom he is; and wherein he is thus Abſolute, does neceſſarily ſuppoſe him, at the ſame time, and in the ſame reſpect, a King, and a Subject: or Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and not Abſolute. Which manifeſtly contradicts its ſelf; and carries its own condemnation along with it. 'Tis true a Governour may be Abſolute in ſome reſpects barely; and ſuch an One may be call'd a King; but that's abuſively onely; and is the ſame as we underſtand by a mixt Monarch. But a King, or Monarch, properly taken, or (as in the Caſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded) an Abſolute Monarch, muſt be ſuch an One to be ſure who is ſet free from the power, and penalty of the laws; who ruling by a paternal right over the ſubjects in his Kingdom, as the ſons, and children of his Family, is not accountable, or to be judged by them; whom yet under God he is bound to provide for.</p>
               <p>Or ſuppoſe him to come in by Compact: Yet to make him Abſolute, and a Monarch, he muſt be free, and abſolv'd, if not from the obſervation, and directive power of the Law, yet from the Coercive, and condemning power of it: if not from pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Mulcts; yet from Capital ſentence: or, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is in danger to be depriv'd of that wherein
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52863:37"/>
he is abſolute, his Kingſhip, or Monarchy. For that is the <hi>minimum quod ſic</hi> the leaſt part that can poſſibly be aſſign'd him of Freedom, and Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therefore is eminently neceſſary, not onely to an Abſolute, but even to a mixt Monarch. The contrary to this being the very Characteriſtick of ſervitude, and ſubjection.</p>
               <p>And therefore now to untye this ſtubborn knot, which through too much eagerneſs, and impatience you have thought neceſſary to break with violence, and ſunder with the ſword. If the ſuppoſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper ariſe to a <hi>Criſis</hi> of Frenzy, and impotency of mind, why then falling in with that of a Fool, or Madman, 'twill be but one, and the ſame Caſe manifeſt, and apparent to all eyes, diſcernible in all his actions: and then to ſet up another is not at all to depoſe him. He is Abſolute, and ſo not to be depoſed. But the Frenzy has carried him away firſt, and removed him from us; and now he is not himſelf. And therefore as before by his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Abſoluteneſs; ſo now by his weakneſs, and Impotency, he falls not at all within the reach of the Law, to be judged, or puniſhed by it; but is ſucceeded to by the next heir, as not being; or as to him that is already dead. But if the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be of a lower nature, as in your Caſe you ſeem to put it, by inſtancing in this deſtemper par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly after that of a fool, and madman. Why then his Abſoluteneſs, being premis'd, and preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, it muſt neceſſarily ſecure him in his Crown. He is ſtill himſelf, and ſo the very man whom the Law inveſts with Sovereignty, and makes Abſolute. Which therefore cannot be pretended to juſtify any in the Aſſaſſinating of his Perſon, or Uſurping his Throne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:52863:38"/>The Law in the caſe inſtanced of an Hereditary Kingdom does not neceſſarily provide to make the wiſeſt, and the beſt man King: As appears plainly by entailing the Sovereignty on the King's heirs before it is known what they will prove, a Man or a Woman: a Ruffain, or a ſober perſon: and not ſettling it by election upon one of mature judgment; approv'd integrity; and greateſt experience. And yet the Law does much the wiſeſt by this Entail. As thereby however running the hazzards of ſome inconveniences which may happen; yet avoiding that grand miſchief of Factions, and Sidings, and Diſunions which are diametrically oppos'd to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and which cannot but fall out in ſuch canvaſings, and elections. Thoſe inconveniences, if at any time they happen, are but as maimes, and blemiſhes in the Government: but this of Schiſm, and Diſunion, is the very death, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of it. Which therefore, as is natural for all Bodies, it eſpecially fortifies againſt, and labours to prevent.</p>
               <p>And from hence then we may ſee not the Law onely, but the Reaſon, and Wiſedom of the Law in not admitting the reſiſtence pleaded for in this ſuppoſed Diſtemper. For that this diſtemper not amounting, as was premis'd, to Frenzy, or Idiotiſm, which is obvious to all; and whereby a man is no longer a man, or reaſonable creature, muſt become the ſubject of much diſpute, and diviſion; the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for any mutinous, and ambitious party to work upon. And as ſometimes it might really prove to be indeed ſuch a diſtemper; yet it might oftener, to be ſure, be ſo pretended, when it were not. Which the Law, or Government, therefore
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52863:38"/>
by admitting in the leaſt ſhould open a neceſſary gap to Confuſion; and by conſequence, to its own deſtruction. And in prevention of a remote, and onely not impoſſible danger, which it might fear to receive at ſome time perhaps from ſuch a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd King (if ſuch a diſtemper without a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Bedlam madneſs be not indeed impoſſible) give it ſelf a ſtab to the heart, whereby it muſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and immediately expire. And thus the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per onely, and Feveriſh indiſpoſition in the King, you would pretend to cure by an Abſolute Frenzy and Frantickneſs in the Government. For ſo the Poet has already cenſured it.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The ſhort of it is this. No policy can give an abſolute ſecurity. We muſt truſt ſome body. But herein is the Goodneſs of God, and the Wiſedom, and Piety of our Anceſtours, in deriving to us ſuch a Form, as brings us neareſt to this ſecurity; and at fartheſt diſtance from danger: as whereby many moſt probable, and certain inconveniences are avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And the onely poſſible miſchief which we can fear from our Governour is ſo very miſchievous, and deſtructive to the intereſt of our Governour himſelf, that we muſt fear very unreaſonably to be afraid of it.</p>
               <p>It is in our power to kill our ſelves; and yet we are not afraid of our ſelves, as Mr. <hi>Diggs</hi> obſerves. Becauſe there is a natural dearneſs implanted in us
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52863:39"/>
which ſecures every one from ſelf wrongs. We have as little cauſe to be troubled that 'tis in the King's power to make himſelf no King by deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſubjects. For ſo the King periſhes in the ruine of his people; and the man onely ſurvives expos'd to the ſcorn, and hatred, and revenge of mankind. Every man's intereſt is the greateſt aſſurance we can deſire of his Integrity. That will hold to be ſure, when all ties, ſacred and humane, are laid aſide. And having that ſo apparently for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, it muſt be our folly, and madneſs to ſuſpect any ſuch diſtemper poſſibly in the King to deſtroy us. But all this being granted at laſt, which we plead for, <hi>viz.</hi> That abſolute Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Monarchy is of all Forms the beſt, which you before acknowledge; and that ours by Law eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed is ſuch, which you no where deny: Yet two objections there are behind, which will ſtill ſtave us off from our deſired Concluſion, if they be not taken out of the way.</p>

               <p>And ſo for our Poſterity, and the generations to come: How are we concern'd in duty not to give them up to ſlavery, and oppreſſion; but to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto them the ſame happy Government, and freedoms, which were left us by the Wiſedom, and Piety of our Fore-fathers?

               <p>Surely if Being, and Well-being, had then been laid in the Scales, and minutely conſider'd by our Fathers with reſpect onely to their own particulars, when the Land was infeſted with Rebels; and the <hi>Danes</hi> had uſurped the authority of this Kingdom: The <hi>Danes</hi> had been our maſters unto this day.

Which has properly nothing of an Engagement in it, but to engage them cloſer to duty, and to expiate their double dealing (whereby they have added a new Engagement contrary to their old Oaths) with double diligence. For ſo their great ſin in engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing does neceſſarily call for a great repentance: and a great repentance muſt neceſſarily bring forth great fruits; <hi>fructus dignos poenitentiâ,</hi> fruits meet for ſuch a repentance.

fight againſt God's Prerogative; or deny him the Power of diſpoſing the Kingdoms of men to whom he pleaſes, without being asked what he does, though he ſhould give them to the baſeſt of Men.

And in all this we ask not God what he doeth, or why he does ſo: but reſt ſatisfied, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, in as much as he is the doer of it. The onely Quere is, How he does it? And that certainly ſince all ways are equally open, and eaſie to him, we may not believe he does by ways and means which his Soul hates. <hi>O houſe of Iſrael are not my ways equal, are not your ways unequal?</hi> The unequal ways, and actions, are our own, which the more they grow, and thrive, whatever providences they may pretend to, they are ſtill but the more unequal, and at fartheſt diſtance from God's ways.

               <p>And then what means the law of Reſtitution? And how pitifully did <hi>Zacheus</hi> overſhoot himſelf in the Goſpel by reſtoring four-fold what he had taken by falſe accuſation? If poſſeſſion be indeed a good Tenure; be-like his crime was that he had not taken enough: if to his falſe accuſation he had but added rebellion, and execution: if while he was nibling at pence he had but exacted pounds: and while he was pilfering the Commons Coffers, he had but plundred <hi>Caeſar</hi> of his Crown, <hi>Euge bone ſerve</hi>! well done good, and faithfull ſervant! have thou authority over ten Cities.

               <p>It has been an old complaint againſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of humane laws, that they were as Spiders webbs, where the little Flies are hamper'd, and taken, but the great one breaks through and eſcape.

But how much a fouler corruption is it that is here charged on the Laws of God? O what a Spiders webb do theſe poiſonous tongues make of it! Not the accepting of perſons indeed, the rich any more than the poor; but which is much more horrid, and blaſphemous, the accepting of ſinners, the great ſinners before the little. And while little ſinners, petty robbers are taken, and damn'd; the great Thieves, and Murtherers, not eſcape onely, but are highly honoured, and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him.

And all this exemplifyed there in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who for his proud ignorance was humbled by God into a very Beaſt: and from reigning on the Throne driven to eat graſs with the Oxen; and to be wet with the dew of Heaven; till after a time his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and humane ſoul again returning, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored again to his Kingdom; <hi>and excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was added unto him.</hi> v. 36.</p>
               <p>Now what is there in all this which without manifeſt wreſting can poſſibly bear that horrid, and helliſh ſuperſtructure which is laid upon it? Nay ſo far is it from a hint this way, as indeed it affords a full heap of proof to the contrary. For if God give the Kingdom to whomſoever he will, and ſetteth up over it the baſeſt of men, and in all this no man may ſay unto him, what doeſt thou? Then none certainly may pretend authority to queſtion, or depoſe, or murther him that is thus ſet up by God, though he ſhould be the baſeſt of men, and they could bring a charge againſt him of Tyranny, and miſgovernment twenty years. 'Tis a right this onely reſerved in the hands of God. <hi>He ruleth in the Kingdoms of men.</hi> And therefore to ſhew his Power, and exemplify his way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Kings in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and diſpoſing of Kingdoms, he does not (for all <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s baſeneſs, though the baſeſt of men) arm his ſubjects againſt him, while he continued to be their King (this is none of God's way) but he firſt takes away his capacity to govern by turning him into a beaſt: And then they who were formerly his ſubjects while he was himſelf; upon this great, and evident change ceaſe to be ſo; and accordingly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52863:46"/>
drive him from among men. Which is exactly parallel to what we ſaid before in the Caſe of Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm, and down-right madneſs: whereby the King degenerates, and ceaſes to be a reaſonable creature. He can be no longer a King that is not a man. God, who onely could, by taking away his reaſon hath depos'd him from his royalty. God hath depos'd him, and not man. And to ſhew that this is it alone which did unking him, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſame that did plainly, and evidently unman him: <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> no ſooner returns to be a man, but his Kingdom returns unto him again. All his former failings, and miſcarriages; all the <hi>Inter reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and ſeven years poſſeſſion of the Kingdom in other hands, does not prejudice his title, or prevent him of his Crown. From the baſeſt of men, nay from a very beaſt he is again become <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as the Etymologiſt derives the word, the <hi>baſis,</hi> and foundation, and ſupport of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

               <p>But this makes nothing for the baſeneſs of the means whereby God is by you ſuppos'd to doe this.

of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s beaſt, may yet be dignified by God with Sovreignty, and Dominion. <hi>Is any thing too hard for the Lord?</hi> Has he not ways, and means enough to entitle him to it, if it ſeemed good in his eyes, either by a voice from Heaven; and ſetting the people at liberty from their former Allegiance; and then diſpoſing their ſuffrage on him: or by bringing him into allyance with the Royal Family, or the like? Onely we ſay (and ſure againſt that there can be no pretence made from the fourth of <hi>Daniel</hi>) that the price of bloud is not to be caſt into the Treaſury of the Lord. Rebellion, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the like, are not to be put upon his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or to be imagin'd as God's way for the authorizing, and impowering any perſon. <hi>Haſt thou kill'd, and alſo taken poſſeſſion?</hi> was yet far enough from entitling <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard.

               </p>
               <p>God's Providence was indeed very viſible, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, <hi>etiam Deo digna,</hi> in ſetling the Government of this Land upon the Family of the STEUARTS by taking away one King, and two Queens ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively by his own hand without children; <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the onely poſterity of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; without the contrivance, and beyond the thought, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Men. And yet farther; He brought our late King to the Throne, which he was never born to, by taking away his elder Brother in the hopes, and ſtrength, and prime of his years. And was not his Providence as viſible upon this, when in the rout, and overthrow of his Army at <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:52863:47"/>
He, who was the onely man aim'd at, was the onely man well nigh that eſcaped? <hi>This was the Lord's doing, and it was marvellous in our eyes.</hi> Whereas now for the outing, and rejecting of them, diſpoſſeſſing, and diſcarding of the Royal Family, ſo much owned by God by ſo many ſteps, and gradations; with ſo many arts, and methods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by him, what do we meet withall but the wickedneſs, and impiety of men? and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as viſible, and eminent, as God's Providence was before for the advancement of them. God raiſed them to the Throne as it were without man immediately by himſelf, and man has pull'd them down without God: So plainly, and manifeſtly without God, that no pretence is laid to God's work in the matter; but that which is the moſt oppoſite, and contrary to it, which does really profeſs God at the greateſt diſtance, and abhorrence from it, Your thriving, and proſpering in your ſin. <hi>Sin when it is finiſhed bringeth forth Death.</hi> And ſure God is never ſo expreſly angry, and offended at us; never removed ſo far from us; never leaves us ſo wholly to our ſelves, as when he ſuffers us to complete our wicked purpoſes.</p>

               <p>And thus, Sir, having run through your whole Letter, and duly conſider'd every part of it that could be any where improv'd into an Objection, I ſhould think it a fit ſeaſon to take my leave. But when I look back, and find this Reply ſwelled to ſuch a monſtrous bulk beyond the pittance, and proportion of an Epiſtle, which is all I deſigned:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52863:48"/>
I have no way to bring my ſelf into ſhape now, but by ſtretching it wider; and ſo ſet up for a little Volume. Which gives me ſcope therefore (holding my ſelf ſtill to the ſubject matter before me) to review again the title of Poſſeſſion as it ſtands pleaded by Mr. <hi>Aſcham,</hi> and ſo downwards from that Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God. The powers that be are ordained of God. Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God. And they that reſiſt ſhall receive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves damnation.</hi> Here the great Emphaſis is laid upon the Powers that be. Which <hi>eo Nomine</hi> in that they be, however they come ſo to be, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd by the Apoſtle, ſay they, to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by God; and then under pein of Damnation not to be oppos'd, or reſiſted by us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Si violandum eſt jus, regni cauſâ violandum eſt,</hi> Thus much the Heathens, who knew not God, were contented ſometimes to bid for a Kingdom, even the price, and forfeiture of common Juſtice. But theſe ſaints are the firſt men, I believe, that ever profeſs'd ſuch love to a Crown, as to bragg of the bargain, and think it a huge penyworth at the loſs, and utter damnation of their Souls. For ſo they expreſly do, while they ſtrive, and plead for it on this Tenure. For there was a time we know within the memory of man, when the Government was held in other hands. To whom certainly that title was then as juſtly applicable <gap reason="foreign">

that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</hi> The application is ſo eaſie, and obvious, as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe them ſo very blind, as not to ſee it. Onely they are ſo eagerly bent to ſecure themſelves in the Throne for the preſent, as in order to that they can willingly bind themſelves to Damnation for ever after. And that is indeed ſuch a vaſt price, and ſo round a payment, as God may afford them (and we ſhall have little reaſon to grudge that he ſhould afford them) all the peace, and pleaſurable enjoyments of their luſts, and ambitions in this world; the ſpoils and treaſure of a poor Church; the ſway, and Government of one ſmall Iſland. Alas! that inflamed reckoning which will be put upon them at laſt in Hell torments, might ſeem hugely unreaſonable, and diſproportion'd, if they had not this bill of Fare going before: <hi>Son, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou in thy life time receiv'dſt thy good things.</hi>

               <p>But the Text, will they ſay, remains ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched. <hi>Incommodum non ſolvit Argumentum.</hi> The Argument is good, and proves what we bring it for, though we perhaps ſhould be damn'd by it.

For then we muſt arraign God of all the Robberies, and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, and Oppreſſions that were committed in the world. And the Magiſtrate cannot pretend to puniſh a Thief, or an Oppreſſour, for that he is a power, as to what he has thus got into his power,

of the ſame Divine original, and eſtabliſhment with himſelf: And ſo acts as lawfully, and authoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his ſphere, as the Magiſtrate can be ſuppoſed upon that ground to act in his. <hi>Magna regna mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na latrocinia.</hi> And I am equally bound to deliver up my purſe upon the demand of the Thief having a power over me; as to pay a Tax, or Tribute, upon the command of the Magiſtrate.

               </p>
               <p>And therefore the Apoſtle, that he might not lie open to this deviliſh miſconſtruction, gives us in the next place the limitation of Powers. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, Thoſe which are rightly Powers, whatever elſe they miſs, and fail in, are certainly regular in this, That they are ordered, and ordained by God.</p>
               <p>And as the Apoſtle has fully explicated, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the meaning of this Phraſe: When he derives the Power from God onely, and beaten back all thoſe ſhameleſs, impudent Pretenders, who would neſtle themſelves under the generality of thoſe Terms, by farther adding, That this Power is ordained of God. To be a Power from God is not to make our ſelves ſo; or be authorized by any other, Officers, or Army: but to be ordained of God. Yet becauſe theſe reſtleſs contenders will <hi>nodum in Scirpo quaerere</hi>; and catch hold on any Bulruſh to ſave themſelves from drowning; or rather indeed from diſcerning the Truth, and being ſaved. To be ordain'd of God, here ſay they, and to be <hi>The Ordinance of God.</hi> v. 2. is nothing elſe but, To be decreed, and ordained of God from all Eternity to ſuch a power; and to be inveſted with it in time by virtue of this Ordinance, or Decree. Which title we juſtly challenge, ſay they, being now actually poſſeſſed of it: which certainly we could not be either without, or againſt God's Decree.</p>
               <p>Not to plunge my ſelf into the vaſt Ocean of God's ſecret Counſels, and Decrees, whoſe Name
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52863:51"/>
being ſecret we are thereby forbidden to enquire after. <hi>Cam vides velatam, quid inquiris in rem ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconditam?</hi> This Tree of knowledge is certainly the forbidden fruit. And in the ſearch whereof it is much eaſier to looſe our eyes, than find an iſſue; as being the moſt immenſe, and inſcrutable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of an infinite, and incomprehenſible Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Yet thus much we may venture to aſſert, That either all things which befall here on Earth, however foreſeen and foreknown by God are not all of them ſo neceſſarily conſtrain'd by any degree of God's to fall out as they do, but that ſome of them (at leaſt as to any ſuch Decree) might fall out otherwiſe than they do: Or elſe that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nay pious, and neceſſary in us to oppoſe ſome events which God has decreed. The reaſon of the conſequence is plainly this: Becauſe we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to oppoſe the being of ſome things which yet actually are, and continue to be. Whereupon it follows that either they are without a Decree according to my firſt Propoſition: Or elſe, that we are bound to reſiſt ſome things which God has decreed, as was ſaid in the Second. Either of theſe Propoſitions being granted (as one of them muſt, for that both cannot be falſe) it will follow that either your poſſeſſing of the Place is no ſure Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God's decree: or ſuppoſing it to be ſo, yet that you are not thereby ſecured from Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Reſiſtence: Nay, that our duty, and piety to God may urge us perhaps notwithſtanding to root you out. Thus Diſeaſes, and Invaſions, though both from God, and according to your Tenet from God's Decree, are yet to be repuls'd by Force, and Phyſick. And who knows whether the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52863:51"/>
Decree to remove you again be not as fix'd, and preſſing as that whereby at preſent you ſtand poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed. <hi>Be not high minded, but fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to take away all ſeeming force of this Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: To be ordain'd by God, and the ordinance of God cannot be here underſtood barely of his Decree. For the words are <gap reason="foreign">

No man is ſo clearly, and evidently not the rightfull Power, as he that takes it unto himſelf, and pleads, and

Inaſmuch as ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill, or not acting, is more competible, or leſs contrary to God's Call, and Ordination, than run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on Ones own head. For ſome men have been call'd, or ſent, or ordain'd by God, which have delayed to go, and act. But no man that took it to himſelf, that run upon his own head, was ever call'd, or impower'd by him. <gap reason="foreign">

Which they can onely fence by plainly denying our Saviour, and St. <hi>Paul.</hi> That whereas they ſpeak of taking the Sword, and taking honour <gap reason="foreign">

The having of honour is a certain evidence of being call'd by God. And poſſeſſing of the Sword does manifeſtly entitle one to the power of it. And therefore leaving them a while to try it out with God, and his Word, I muſt be allow'd upon this Authority to ſuppoſe their Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion turn'd out of doors. And then the onely task remaining for me is to find out ſomething to fill up the place, that may be an evident mark of God's Ordination, whereby this Power is convey'd to a Perſon, and how we ſhall know it.</p>
               <p>God's Lordſhip, and Sovreignty over us does originally ariſe from the right of a Creatour. In that he is the cauſe, and authour of our being, he
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52863:52"/>
muſt neceſſarily have an abſolute dominion over us, who are produced, and created by him. <hi>It is he that hath made us, and not we our ſelves,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt. And then it follows regularly in the next words, <hi>We are his people, &amp;c.</hi> And as he was pleas'd not to produce all men, as he did <hi>Adam,</hi> ſolely and immediately by Himſelf, though he had the reſidue of the Spirit, as the Prophet ſpeaks: but to take in man as a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and Copartner with him in the production of the reſt, deriving them by Generation one from another. He has hereby admitted man likewiſe into a partnerſhip of his Sovreignty: made him naturally a Sovreign over thoſe who receive their being, and production from him. And thus Parents are petty gods in relation to their children. And children have the obligation of creatures upon them in reſpect unto their Parents. And this not onely to their next, and immediate parents who beget them; but upon the ſame Tenure (for <hi>Cauſa cauſae eſt cauſa cauſati</hi>) to their Parent's Parents, <hi>Avus, Proavus, Tritavus,</hi> Grandfather, Great-grandfather, and ſo upwards. Every one in the whole Category, and Succeſſion of them being a <hi>Subalternum genus</hi>: That is to ſay, a Power in reſpect of thoſe under them; but a Species, and Subject ſtill in reſpect of the <hi>Summum Genus,</hi> the Supreme Parent from whom they flow, and by whom they are ſent. And thus a Family becomes a Kingdom: and the King, or <hi>Pater patriae</hi> Father of the Countrey, is the very <hi>Paterfamilias</hi> Maſter of the Family. And as <hi>Noah,</hi> if he were ſtill alive, would certainly be <hi>Rex Catholicus</hi> not in Title onely, but in Truth, the Catholick, or Univerſal Monarch of the whole World; as being the Father
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52863:53"/>
of all the Families, and Kingdoms now in being. So this Univerſal Monarchy muſt neceſſarily expire upon his death, and become divided, as it was between his three Sons <hi>Shem, Ham</hi> and <hi>Japhet.</hi> None of them being a Father, and therefore not a King over the other: but every one a Father, and abſolute in his own Family. <hi>Shem</hi> the elder brother being ſtill but a Brother; and ſo though he had many privileges, and priorities, even a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above the reſt, as due by his Birthright. Yet not neceſſarily, or by the law of Nature to ſucceed into a paternal power over his brethren, no more than he could be a natural Father to them.</p>
               <p>And as here began the diſtinction of Kings, and Kingdoms in theſe three Brethren, and their Families: So they all multiplying into many Sons; and thoſe Sons into many more, who were all after their Fathers deaths, as their Fathers before them had been, abſolute, and Independent Monarchs over their reſpective children. Every Family being ſtill a ſeveral Kingdom, it muſt needs be that in proceſs of time among ſo many Kings, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms all abſolute, and independent from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; there could not but fall matter of continual, and endleſs Controverſie. Every leſſer Family op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by the greater. Every difference with a Neighbour being onely determinable by the ſword, and to be managed by a bloudy war. For the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which great inconvenience manifeſtly ariſing from the multiplicity of Kings, and Kingdoms; we muſt ſuppoſe, That either admoniſhed by God, or prompted by right Reaſon, theſe ſeveral Fathers of Families, ſo many of them as were adjoyn'd by any nearneſs of place, and Kindred meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52863:53"/>
in one body, and others in another, and ſo of the reſt, did give up this their abſolute power, which they had ſeverally before over their own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, into the hands of ſome one perſon, incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating themſelves, and their Families into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; adopting themſelves his children; and by uniting their ſeveral paternal powers in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, did thereby make, and acknowledge him the common Father of them all. And that not perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally onely, or with limitation to his particular ſelf, (For then at his death they muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the ſame inconveniences as before. Which by the greater increaſe of Families would then become much greater: and which therefore they were concern'd the rather, and with greater diligence to prevent) but to his Heirs after him. So making his Family to be a Family of Fathers in their ſeveral generations to them, and their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies for ever.</p>
               <p>And that this is indeed the true original of Kings, and Monarchs, all particular paternal powers being really transferr'd, and united in them, is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as Mr. <hi>Diggs</hi> obſerves. Becauſe elſe we ſhould be bound to obey our Fathers commands before thoſe of the Kings. For divine precept ſtands in full force, <hi>Honour thy Father, &amp;c.</hi> Which being, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>the firſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with promiſe,</hi> and the firſt in the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, does certainly in its own weight, and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (and ſo ought to do in our value, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance) out-ſtrip all other after Commandments of the ſame Nature with it, or relating to Man. And were not therefore to be ſet lower in the leaſt by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52863:54"/>
and obeying the King before our Father; if it were not certain that the King is more our Father, than our Father that does beget us. <hi>Tam pater nemo eſt in terris.</hi> No man is ſo much our Father, as the King. And to whom therefore the honour enjoyn'd us towards our Father does moſt eminently, and in the firſt place, upon that very account, belong.</p>
               <p>But if this derivation of Kingly Power ſhould not become perhaps ſo plain, and intelligible to ordinary apprehenſions, as too far removed out of their ſight: I ſhall endeavour in a new draught to bring it nearer; and by clear, and evident inſtances, to facilitate the underſtanding of it.</p>
               <p>God doth impower a Perſon, or call, and ordain him to power by two manner of ways. Either mediately, or immediately. Immediately, and by himſelf, ſo he called <hi>Aaron</hi> to the Prieſthood; <hi>Saul,</hi> and after him <hi>David</hi> to the Kingdom: mediately, or by right from theſe, as <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and his Sons after him ſucceeded to <hi>Aaron</hi>: So <hi>Solomon,</hi> and his Sons after him ſucceeded <hi>David</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Though all theſe may be rather ſaid to be immediately call'd by God, in as much as in the firſt inveſtiture, and conferring authority on <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> the promiſe, and ſo the Power was made to them, and their ſeeds for ever. Which yet while it was immediately done by God, was never ſo immediately done by him, as not to take in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of men for the doing of it; even ſome known authentick Prophet to convey this meſſage, to call, and conſecrate the perſon to this authority. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> by God's appointment ſettles the Prieſthood
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52863:54"/>
upon <hi>Aaron</hi>: and <hi>Samuel</hi> the Kingdom upon <hi>David.</hi> And whoever will derive from this claim, even this immediate call from God, muſt not pretend I know not what Revelations from Heaven between God and his own Soul; the ſecret whiſperings of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſpirit to impower him in it. For beſides that a man's own ambition will eaſily whiſper, and prompt him to ſuch motions; God's own ſecret and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate way is not ſo very ſecret, and immediate. And upon this reaſon; becauſe Power, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity being a relative to obedience; the Power of the King to the obedience of the people, if it were thus privately, and ſecretly conveyed to him onely whoſe intereſt, and advantage it is to pretend it; how could this draw after it the ſubjection, and obedience of the people, unleſs we ſhould reſolve quite contrary to <hi>David</hi>'s, <hi>Omnis homo mendax,</hi> All men are liars; that every man ſpeaks right, and truth in his own cauſe. Which principle as ſoon as ever it could be taken up muſt neceſſarily be proved falſe by ſo many pretenders as would ariſe under the favour of it one againſt another. And therefore the revelation in this caſe muſt be to the People as well as to the Prince: or, as God has better deſign'd it, to a Prophet known, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all. Otherwiſe if God ſhould ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly call him to be the Prince, or Protector; yet where has the People by this any call, or warrant to be his ſubjects? If he have a revelation to be our Sovreign: yet we have no revelation to be his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And how is he a Prince then that has no People? Let the Prince therefore that pretends this tenure produce his Prophet: and the Prophet produce
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52863:55"/>
his Commiſſion. Which if he can confirm with no better miracle than that lying wonder of ſucceſs, and cauſing Fire to come down from Heaven; kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſlaying as many as will not receive him: he proves himſelf but a falſe Prophet by all this. As appears, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.13. And he, and the Beaſt which he worſhips, the <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>But indeed, whatſoever is ſaid, this immediate way, and call, could onely be expected when God was pleas'd to govern immediately by a voice, and revelation from Heaven, as among the <hi>Jews.</hi> But for the generality of mankind, and the reſt of the world, he has left them, as the Wiſe man tells us, <hi>in the hands of their own counſels. Chriſt's Kingdom is not of this world.</hi> Nor has he ever been known from the firſt day of his Incarnation to call, or conſecrate any man to Power, and Dominion, merely Secular, by any of his Apoſtles, or Prophets in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way. All that he does peculiarly in this matter is by giving laws to hold us faſt to duty, and Allegiance; confirm, and ratify the Covenants we have made, and the Oaths we have taken: im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power the Perſon whom the Law has appointed for our Prince; over-rule all the actions, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels both of Prince, and People, as ſeems beſt to his divine Wiſedom, and for the good of his Church. And laſtly, when he pleaſes to alter the Government not by permiſſion barely, which wicked, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable men may extort from him, but by his own act, and approbation he ſo diſpoſes, and orders affairs, and Perſons, that by the laws, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52863:55"/>
rights among men it is transferred to another. <hi>Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law; I am not come to deſtroy but to fulfill.</hi> This though ſpoken by our Saviour in relation to the <hi>Moſaical</hi> law, is verified likewiſe of him in relation to the law of Nature, and of Nations, and the Municipal laws of every particular Kingdom, ſo far as they are not repugnant to that Supreme Law of his laid down in the Holy Scripture. <hi>He comes not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy but to fulfill them</hi>; not to ſuperſede, or evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them; but to hold us the faſter, and the cloſer to them; to make us the more dutifull, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to them in our ſeveral places, and relations, whether of Nature, Nations, or thoſe of our own Land.</p>
               <p>And this the Apoſtle has plainly intimated. When as a motive of all chearfull ready obedience of wives to their Husbands; of children to their Parents; of ſervants to their Maſters; and ſo of ſubjects to their Sovreigns, he tell us, that in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying them, we obey not men but God, even the Lord Chriſt.<note place="margin">Col. 3.24.</note> Whereby it appears that their laws are not their laws, but Chriſt's. And that he dictates to us by their mouths, this being that which, as it preſerves peace, and a decent Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination among men, does admirably ſet forth the Excellency of Chriſt's Oeconomy, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, with ſuch a power of Wiſedom (as becomes him that is the Wiſedom of the Father) as without making uſe of the ſtrength of his arm, or doing every thing by mere force, he does yet effect, and bring to paſs what alterations he pleaſes in the world by his wonderfull, and wiſe diſpoſing

                  <hi>David,</hi> and his ſeed after him, as with us to the King, and his Heirs, 'tis very obſervable they were not anointed afreſh in their ſeveral Succeſſions (as they need not with us any New, and particular election of the people) but the Ointment upon the head ran down upon the beard, and went down to the skirts of his clothing: and ſo the hem of this royal robe, the very farthermoſt in the Succeſſion has God's anointing, <hi>viz.</hi> the People's lawfull Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon him. Which they cannot reverſe, though to take place onely (as <hi>David</hi>'s actual perſonal anointing did not prefer him to the Crown till the death of <hi>Saul</hi>) when by the death of thoſe before him it rightly, and regularly deſcends upon him. For ſo the anointing the King with Oil was but an Emblematical ceremony of placing that Perſon ſo anointed in Supremacy above the reſt; from that peculiar quality in Oil to be uppermoſt, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme in all mixtures (and therefore the Lord's anointed in the Old Teſtament is call'd the Supreme in the New. <hi>Whether to the King as Supreme.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13.) which is done <hi>viva vice,</hi> or in words at length in the peoples election. And therefore to chuſe, and to anoint a King or <hi>Synonoma</hi>'s, or words of the ſame ſignification. So in <hi>Jotham</hi>'s parable, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.8. When the Trees went forth to chuſe a King, they went forth, it is ſaid, to anoint a king over them. And in the 15<hi>th</hi> verſe, <hi>If in truth ye anoint me king over you, i. e.</hi> make me your King.<note place="margin">Exod. 30.31.39.38. Pſal. 89.20.</note> v. 16. And then the anointing Oil was holy, as we may reade in ſeveral places, to ſhew that the King's Perſon was by this anointing become ſacred. His ſacred Majeſty as we us'd to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52863:59"/>
ſay, not to be prophan'd therefore by rude, or common uſage. <hi>Touch not mine Anointed</hi>: And, <hi>Who can ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lord's Anointed, and be guiltleſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In brief, God's method in ſetting up a King was anciently by ſending a Prophet with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to pour Oil upon the head of that Perſon whom he deſigned for that Honour. Now the People is that Prophet. God's ſending the Prophet with commiſſion to anoint ſuch a Perſon is his opening a fair lawfull way, and inclining the hearts of the people to the Election of this Perſon: and the peoples voices, and ſuffrages pour'd upon him in the Election is the very holy Oil upon his head, whereby he is made Sacred, and irreſiſtible. Where firſt the ſuffrage of the people is the Oil of the Prophet. Which as the Prophet might not be pouring out firſt upon this Perſon, and then upon that, as often as he pleaſes, but onely when God ſends him. So nor are the People impower'd to reject this, and elect a New King, but when God gives them commiſſion, that is to ſay, when a fair vacancy, and utter extinction is made of the Perſon, and Family whom they had formerly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. In the mean time the Prophet has nothing to doe with the Oil; nor have the People any voice, or ſuffrage whereby to confer Sovreignty on any. And ſecondly, as in the anointing with Oil the Prophet that pour'd the Oil yet was not he that gave the power; but the means, and Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger onely by whom it was conveyed: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was himſelf ſubject to the King as ſoon as he was thus anointed by him. So the People in their
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52863:60"/>
election, and impowering any by their ſuffrage, are not to be lookt upon as the Authours, and Donours of the power; but the means, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely whereby God conveys it to this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>There is no power but of God.</hi> Neither the Prophet, nor the People had <hi>Jus vitae &amp; necis,</hi> Power of Life and Death over others, much leſs over themſelves: and not having it, cannot be ſuppoſed to beſtow it (<hi>Nihil dat quod non habet</hi>) which therefore muſt needs be deriv'd to him from a higher original. And the People in their fulleſt freeſt convention, when they are moſt the People, remain ſtill in the condition of the People; as the Prophet in the caſe before, in a degree, that is to ſay, of Subjection, and Inferiority to the King ſet over them.</p>
               <p>That there may be indeed a King, as there is a Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> inferiour to the Senate, and Body of the People, we have before acknowledged. But ſuch an One is, as I have ſaid, abuſively call'd a King. And the arraying him with royal Title, and denying him the power of it is but the ſame piece of mocking, as when <hi>Herod</hi> cloathed our Lord in purple, and put a Reed in his hand, <hi>viz.</hi> a Sceptre that muſt bow, and give way at every blaſt of the People. The colours that waſh off were never laid in Oil. He that is truely a King is as truely Supreme. And that Ours in this Kingdom is truely, and rightly ſuch, if it be not granted before, may be proved evidently by the Oil of his anointing; and ſo at large from the body of our Laws; and moſt undeniably from that particular Law, which with ſo much pena<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

does urge, and require it of us, to ſwear in expreſs Terms, That the King's Highneſs is Supreme in theſe Realms. And leſt there might be room left for copeing, or joyning others in Supremacy with him to intermingle other liquors with this Holy Oil, by fanſying a Coordination between the King and his Parliament, as was once pretended: It is yet more plain, and full, in the words of the Oath. The King's Highneſs not onely is Supreme, but the onely Supreme Governour in this Realm. And being ſo, it is thereby evident that all the ſacredneſs, and immunities of the Lord's anointed in the Old Teſtament: All the Honours, and Prerogatives which are affixed to the Higher Powers in the New: <hi>Whether to the</hi>

                  </gap> in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> do truely, and properly belong unto him. His non-poſſeſſion will not allow us in a non-ſubjection. Honour, and Cuſtome, and Tribute, ſays Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> not where theſe are claim'd but where theſe are due. And to be ſubject for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake, as we are enjoyn'd, never reſpects how high, or how low, our King is; how near, or how far off; but has the ſame force upon us even when we have leaſt reaſon to be afraid of his wrath.</p>
               <p>And therefore to drive this to the quick, Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſword has two edges. The firſt againſt the Romaniſts, who upon the Pope's account, and in obedience to him, do take liberty of diſobeying their King. Againſt theſe in the firſt words. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers.</hi>
