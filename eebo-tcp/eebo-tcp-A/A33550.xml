            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PART I. An account of thoſe Sickneſſes that are incident to Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring People.</head>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</note> THere are none who have us'd the Sea for any time, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Royal Navy, but muſt be highly ſenſible how uſeful an <hi>undertaking</hi> of this nature is; and how aſſiſting to moſt of the Surgeons, who purſue their employments at Sea, and particularly in the Meridian for which this is calculated; and yet 'twas never attempted by any, of what Nation ſoever, as far as I can learn, either by reading or converſation. Officers and Sailers muſt needs have their courage (which is naturally great, beſides its being ſupported by the Applauſes and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40814:8"/>
Rewards of Honour) much augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the ſecurity they may have in the ſuitable proviſion that is made for their health; and the Surgeons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, having a full view of all the maladies they are to encounter upon that Element, will ſurely be better provided than when their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are more general.</p>
            <p>Its uſe, I think, by theſe ſmall hints, is put beyond all exception; and I do heartily wiſh I could have as good help to my practiſing in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicin in our world, the warry Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but ſince I can have none, I doubt not but the ingenious will very eaſily pardon a Treatiſe of this kind; and almoſt any miſtakes, I can fall under, ſince the paths of former Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are as little perceptible, as the furrows made upon the face of the angry Abyſs, by our lofty floating Forts, can prove guides to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that ſteer the ſame courſe but next hour: for my own part, I ſhould have no more ventur'd upon it, than I ſhould have been the firſt that put to Sea, were it not that the ſtation Providence has plac'd me in, might ſeem to demand ſome teſtimony of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40814:8"/>
my diligence in the ſame; which, I muſt confeſs, is not ſo great as the Service requires. This I was, once, reſolved to perform by the way of a Journal of thoſe Sickneſſes, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d ſince my concern in the Fleet; but thinking, again, that this ſhould be more complete, if I ſhould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in general, by their way of living, the Sickneſſes they might be moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, and then year after year, ſo long as I am to continue with them, to give the particular Hiſtory of the Sickneſſes of that year, with an exact account of the ſucceſs in the ſame; which will be ſo many confirmations of my general Theory, and evince how well or ill it is eſtabliſhed. And therefore I ſhall firſt endeavour, to<note place="margin">Its order.</note> diſcover <hi>ſuch ſickneſſes as may be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to people that uſe our narrow Seas; to diſtinguiſh them from thoſe that may be got nearer, or under, the line; from thoſe that may be common upon the land, to what we have ſometimes at Sea; and lastly, in the hiſtory of this year, to denote, in ſome meaſure, the Indications for, and the Method of Cure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that all theſe may be purſu'd with the greateſt exactneſs imaginable,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40814:9"/>
it will be highly neceſſary, firſt to deſcribe <hi>the particular way of their living;</hi> that from this we may ſee and deduce as naturally, as is poſſible, thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, that moſt eſpecially follow thereupon; and this we ſhall do, firſt by conſidering <hi>their victuals allowed them for their daily ſuſtenance; their way of living;</hi> and laſtly <hi>their life,</hi> as to their <hi>temperance</hi> or <hi>debauches.</hi> I am not ignorant how uſeful, yea neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it had been, to have had ſome reſpect to, and conſideration of the temper and conſtitution of the <hi>air,</hi> they live in, and how ſatisfying it would have proved to ſuch as are <hi>curious</hi> and <hi>ingenious,</hi> to have made ſome Remarks upon the <hi>differences</hi> of that at <hi>ſea</hi> and <hi>land:</hi> but all I can ſay upon that head being ſo general and precarious, and of ſo little real uſe in my deſign, that I have rather choſen to paſs it by in perfect ſilence, and not to offer that to the world, of which I have ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſatisfaction my ſelf: yet, this I did not leave quite unattempted, but did carry a very good <hi>Baryſcope</hi> on board with me, and did hang it as conveniently as I could contrive; yet in the <hi>calmeſt</hi> weather, and at <hi>anchor,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40814:9"/>
the <hi>heaving</hi> motion of the Ship did ſo much diſturb my <hi>Mercury,</hi> that I did conclude it of no uſe, and perfectly unpracticable, when under ſail with the eaſieſt gale of wind; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay no more of this, I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take my ſelf to the conſiderations I have juſt now propoſed.</p>

So that whatever a Sailer may complain of in the <hi>Royal Navy,</hi> his victuals are a great deal better, and his allowance larger, than in any <hi>Navy</hi> or <hi>Merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi>

in the world. Their drink is as good <hi>Table beer</hi> as any Family in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> can drink; and the <hi>quantum</hi> is what they will. So that, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, if we conſider the number of men, the length of the Voyages, in Convoys and Cruiſers, the Grand Fleet in the Channel, and their Work; their Diet will be found, in all theſe circumſtances, to be almoſt as well provided and adapted, even for the preſervation of health, as it can poſſibly be.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, <hi>ſalt victuals</hi> have been found, by experience, the worſt of all other to digeſt; and <hi>Sanctorius,</hi> in his book of <hi>Statical Medicin,</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that they are the victuals by which we perſpire leaſt; and ſtill leſs by Pork than the reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo, by the laws of <hi>Perſpiration,</hi> it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to contain the groſſeſt juices and the worſt nouriſhment: but all this will be more plain and evident, than I could here, without a needleſs digreſſion, demonſtrate, if we conſider the requiſits for <hi>digeſtion</hi> and <hi>nutrition,</hi> which I have laid down very plainly, and in few words, when I purpoſely treated of that ſubject, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Yet, after all, the bodies of ſuch working people, not only make the beſt of ſuch <hi>ſolid</hi> food; but this, ev'n, ſeems neceſſary for thoſe who are oblig'd to undergo ſo great labour; for tho the ſtomachs of ſedentary people, and of thoſe who uſe little exerciſe, are not able to reduce ſuch parched and ſolid food into <hi>Chyle,</hi> in twelve or fifteen hours time; and when that is done, this <hi>Chyle</hi> is ſo <hi>thick,</hi> that it is ſcarcely able to perform its firſt <hi>voyage</hi> thro the lacteal veſſels, but ſtops and makes obſtructions in thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and diſpoſes ſuch people to <hi>Dropſies,</hi> the <hi>Jaundice,</hi> and other <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chectical</hi> diſeaſes. And even tho it ſhou'd eſcape theſe obſtacles, brought its full length, the <hi>contraction</hi> of the Heart in thoſe, and the <hi>force</hi> of their <hi>Lungs</hi> in the exſpiration are ſo faint, and moſt of their other Muſcles being ſeldom acted, the Chyle, as it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried along their blood-veſſels, is not ſufficiently preſs'd, or broken into ſmall enough particles, that it may become homogeneous, at leaſt to our

ſenſes, with the blood; and ſo is apt to produce all thoſe <hi>inconveniencies, groſſer blood</hi> or <hi>bodies</hi> greater than the blood carried about in it, are ſaid to do: yet things being quite otherwiſe with our Sailers, and in one part of their buſineſs or another, ſcarce one muſcle of the whole body being left unimploy'd, their digeſtion and nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not only go as well on with them in this diet, as the moſt delicate food with Ladies; but this ſort of victuals is, even, neceſſary for their toyl and labour, and that which is finer and more eaſily digeſted, would not prove of long enough continuance for their work.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alling.</note> From what has been ſaid, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the greater the work and labour is, in this way of living, the digeſtion and nutrition will be the better perform'd; the motion of the blood will be more exact, and the health of the Sailers will be more firm; and, upon the other ſide, the leſs their work is, the hardneſs of the food, and its ſaltneſs, will proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably have their effects, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion that follows upon the one, and the fiery heat that attends the

            <p>'Tis very evident from the heating properties of <hi>Salt,</hi> and eſpecially of its corroſive bittern, that 'tis <hi>that</hi> only, which can produce ſuch an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſenſe of heat, as we find after a meal of ſuch victuals; and becauſe that heat cannot be produc'd, without a greater degree of <hi>velocity</hi> of the blood, and a greater <hi>ſecretion</hi> of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpirits, which contract the heart, and produce this velocity; and they cannot be ſeparated without a greater <hi>attrition</hi> of the blood: therefore, ſince this <hi>heat</hi> is felt, it is this bittern of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that, in this greater poſſeſſion of ſpace, rarefaction, and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial <hi>moles,</hi> as we may ſay, the thinner, and more capillary veſſels have not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion enough to reſiſt this new bulk; but the blood breaks over its banks, and in as great a quantity as the force of the motion of the rarify'd blood, the greatneſs of the emiſſary, and the reſiſtance of the place, into which it breaks, will allow; ſo that if <hi>this</hi> be ſuperficial, if any great quantity is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and the blood's motion ſo weak, that there is not matter enough perſpired, which both by its <hi>quantity</hi> and <hi>force</hi> may keep it fluxile, and carry off ſome of the ſmaller parts of the blood, thus let out by its ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And ſince the extraordinary ſpace is poſſeſt by this viſcid and rarify'd blood, the blood veſſels that are ſo fill'd, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thoſe parts that are contiguous to them, and have leſs power to reſiſt, than their ſides have to go outward;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40814:13"/>
and therefore, in this ſtuffing of the Arteries in the <hi>ſoft brain,</hi> their ſides, thus bending outwards, will eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſs ſuch veſſels, that are touch'd by 'em, whether they are veins, arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or nerves; if their reſiſtance be leſs than the force that thruſts 'em out, and ſo the liquors ſtagnating in all thoſe, muſt preſs the neighbouring veſſels, and hinder the tranſmiſſion of their liquors, in proportion to thoſe powers by which they are preſt. Thus a ſmaller quantity will be carry'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their cavity; and by reaſon of this compreſſion, the quantity of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpirits that glides into the cavity of the nerves with an extraordinary weakneſs is diminiſht, becauſe their coats are depreſt, and their channels ſtraitned; ſo that ſince by their influx into the nerves, and derivation into the muſcles, their contraction is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and upon this the ſtrength of the whole body depends; then, in this ſmall diſtribution of the animal ſpirits, which is leſs than what is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, the contraction of the muſcles is not ſo powerful as naturally it ought<note place="margin">With an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> to be, and the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of the body <hi>extraordinary.</hi> Moreover, ſince the

               <hi>heart</hi> hath the ſame properties, and is ſubject to the ſame laws, with the other muſcles; and <hi>they</hi> being more weakly contracted, becauſe of a leſſer quantity of animal ſpirits, that are deriv'd into them; ſo muſt the heart be more faintly contracted too; and ſince, by the conſent of Phyſitians, and the evidence of reaſon, the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>blood</hi> depends upon the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the hearts contraction; the contraction of the heart being weaker, 'tis plain, that this confus'd mixture of viſcid and rarify'd blood, will have but a very weak motion; which is continu'd in the blood, till its return to the heart, bating what it has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, in its circulation, to the <hi>arteries</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> to be propelled; but ſince it is ſtill loſing part of its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the further it goes from the heart; the blood will be, on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, apt to ſtagnate in the ſmaller and remoter veſſels; and ſo produce thoſe <hi>red, blue,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſpots,</hi> we have ſpoken of. Beſides, ſince the Pulſe is only occaſion'd, by the greater quantity of blood propell'd into the narrower ſections of the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and this impulſion depends
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40814:14"/>
upon the contraction of the heart, as we have ſaid; therefore becauſe, in this heated and rarify'd blood, there is ſometimes a greater, and ſometimes a leſs quantity of animal ſpirits ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; and ſince the contraction of the heart depends on their ſeparation and influx, that will be ſometimes greater, and ſometimes weaker, and ſo the protruſion of the blood being ſometimes perform'd in a ſhorter time, and ſometimes in a longer, and in a greater or ſmaller quantity; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,<note place="margin">And an unequal Pulſe.</note> the Pulſe will be <hi>quicker</hi> and <hi>ſlower, greater</hi> and <hi>weaker,</hi> as we find by experience.

After the ſame manner, by conſidering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our other liquors, and their motion, I could demonſtrate their depravation, and explain, (tho at too great a length for this place) the other ſymptoms that appear. But ſeeing they may be brought from theſe fountains, which I have ſufficiently dwelt upon; I think, I have ſaid enough to explain the way, how this ſickneſs is produced with us, and to ſhow that 'tis a neceſſary conſequence of an idle life, and of feeding on <hi>Salt Beef</hi> and <hi>Pork;</hi> and therefore I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the next propoſition, I laid down.

Thus, for example, we frequently ſee <hi>vomiting</hi> in <hi>Fevers, Scurvys,</hi> the <hi>Iliac Paſſion,</hi> the <hi>Stone in the Kidneys</hi> or <hi>

And I ſhall proceed to the next thing to be conſider'd in order, which may be ſufficiently and eaſily underſtood, from what I have ſaid of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding two.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Their Bread.</note> The next thing I ſhall conſider is their <hi>bread,</hi> of which every man is allow'd one pound a day. Moderate eating of bread has, in all ages, been
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40814:17"/>
eſteemed to contribute very much to the preſervation of our health, tho none have approv'd of <hi>quantities. Omnis Repletio mala, panis peſſima;</hi> a ſurfeit of any thing is bad, but one of bread is the worſt: its ſubſtance is tough and tenacious; and therefore is not ſo eaſily broken and divided by the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and if eaten at any time in a greater quantity, than is ſufficient to give a body to the Chyle, it is very apt to make way for obſtructions, and to breed very thick and groſs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. But an entire abſtinence from bread deprives the Chyle of that due and neceſſary body, that is requiſite to make its paſſage ſlow enough thro the Guts, that it may be the better thruſt into the <hi>indiſcernible</hi> doors of the <hi>lacteal veſſels:</hi> and therefore, in ſuch a famine and ſcarcity of bread, the body is depriv'd of thoſe juices that are made of our victuals, beſides <hi>gripings,</hi> moſt troubleſome <hi>looſeneſſes,</hi> and ſuch other ſickneſſes as attend them. Having ſpoken thus much of bread, in the general, I ſhall neither pretend to determin the ſufficient quantities of bread that are to be eaten, nor enquire, whether the crumb
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40814:18"/>
of cruſt of bread are the moſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. For theſe queſtions are not proper for this place; ſince all that concerns us, is the conſideration of the effects our <hi>Sea-bisket</hi> may have upon their bodies, who are oblig'd to make it a part of their daily food.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, a pound of <hi>bread</hi> ſo <hi>dry</hi> and <hi>ſolid</hi> as that muſt be, that it may be the fitter for keeping, if it were brought to the <hi>conſiſtence</hi> of <hi>common bread,</hi> would at leaſt be thrice as big as it is, while in Bisket; which, I'm apt to believe, is a little too much for men generally to eat. Beſides, after it is ground by the teeth, and ſent into the ſtomach, 'tis extremely hard to be digeſted, if it be not very fine; and if fine, it ſo imbibes the ſmall quantity of Chyle, that is made of the other victuals, that the maſs of blood receives a very ſmall quantity of it; and that maſh which paſſeth the guts, where the lacteal veſſels are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, is ſo hardned and compact, that people upon that diet but ſeldom trouble the Stool; which every one knows to be of very ill conſequence, and eſpecially at Sea. From what has been ſaid, 'tis not only evident, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40814:18"/>
the abovementioned victuals, are not fine enough to produce thoſe ſubtile animal ſpirits, that make people ſo eaſily advert to, and apprehend at ſight, whatever is propoſed; and ſo, not fit to make Wits: but by the groſsneſs of their humours, the Seamen are diſpos'd to moſt Chronical Diſeaſes, ſo ſoon as they are in the leaſt overcome with idleneſs and lazineſs: tho, otherwiſe, all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies that happen, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive <hi>coſtiveneſs,</hi> that troubleſom attendant of our ſickneſſes. So that we may ſay, that a little too much eating of ſuch bread, not only thickens the humours too much, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes our men to other ſickneſſes; but immediately produces that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous <hi>coſtiveneſs,</hi> which is apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo many other Maladies, and always obſtructs the cure of Fevers. For when our Inteſtins are ſtuff'd with a great many days victuals, they are ſo diſtended, and the blood veſſels in them ſo preſt or ſtraitned, that the circulation through them is very much interrupted, and not only the blood that us'd to flow that way, but even that of the neighbouring parts is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40814:19"/>
forced from its channels, and equally filling the channels of the reſt of the parts of the body, that have leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, in ſome degree preſs the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin of the Nerves in the Brain, and blood veſſels of the eyes; and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that <hi>Stupor</hi> and <hi>Thickneſs</hi> of <hi>Sight,</hi> people frequently feel in that caſe. Beſides the Chyle muſt needs be very much interrupted, and kept from being convey'd in a ſufficient quantity for recruiting the maſs of blood, by the preſſure of the lacteal veſſels, which are interwoven with the guts: for the Chyle is forced along the whole length of the guts, with the groſſer maſh; and ſo, the body is not only depriv'd of its neceſſary nouriſhment, but there's an eminent hazard of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in the lacteal veſſels, which very often produces thoſe dangerous Aſcites's that are ſo ſeldom cur'd.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40814:20"/>
judgment of very many, that <hi>there is no power in the Air,</hi> different from its <hi>weight</hi> or <hi>gravity,</hi> able to produce thoſe ſymptoms, that are ſaid to follow upon obſtruction, or ſhutting up of the pores, when we <hi>catch cold,</hi> and ſo may diſturb and interrupt perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and breed ſo many fatal diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which 'twould be needleſs to inſiſt upon in this place, ſince the thing is generally agreed upon; yet I cannot forbear obſerving, that an untimely uſe of <hi>Sweating Medicines</hi> in ſome, and thickning <hi>Lozenges</hi> in others, is more frequently the productive cauſe of Fevers, Phthiſicks, &amp;c. and of more fatal conſequence than a Cold could have been, if left to the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the blood and <hi>abſtinence,</hi> without employing any other Auxiliaries; but more for the confirmation of this, may be eaſily collected from what follows in this Diſcourſe.

            <p>Since then, I find 'tis agreed on by all Phyſicians, that perſpiration in a catch'd cold, is not ſo free as in a natural ſtate, but is interrupted; and a great deal of that ſubſtance, that is uſually ſep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having thus enumerated theſe ſymptoms, that appear conſtantly in our Fevers, and in the ſame order in which I have rank'd them: I ſhall<note place="margin">An Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.</note> now endeavour to evince the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of their attending an interruption of perſpiration, as I intimated before; and hereafter I ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate, that that <hi>fulneſs,</hi> which gives riſe to all theſe appearances, is more eſpecially to be attributed to an interruption of perſpiration than
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40814:22"/>
any other cauſe; and ſo the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> tho own'd by every one, will be more than one that is <hi>merely</hi> ſuch.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, an interruption of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration will encreaſe the <hi>Moles</hi> or bulk of the Fluids, proportionably to what is left unexpell'd, of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity which uſually paſſeth thro the pores; and becauſe <hi>Sanctorius</hi> in his Statical Medicin, has taught us that we perſpire, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conſtitutions of our bodies, about forty, fifty, or ſixty ounces in 24 hours; therefore if but a ſixth part of this be detain'd, as I could prove it to be; it muſt needs produce a very great Plethora in a day or two, in ſuch that were in perfect health before, beſides the addition may be ſuppos'd to be made by our daily food, and, perhaps, rarifying liquors. The blood upon this conſideration admitting of a vaſt augmentation, diſtends the ſides of its Channels, is more unfit for motion, and preſſeth the neighbouring parts, and ſo may eaſily produce the ſenſe we have, and very often complain of an unnatural weight: for in this weight or heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40814:22"/>
we have the ſame ſenſation, as when loaded under a great burden, and therefore in this, the parts are the ſame way affected, as when a weight preſſes our body; but by this weight, the Membranes, Nerves and Muſcles are ſo preſt, and the Bones ſo forc'd into their Joinings, that they could not ſubſiſt, if it were not for the violent <hi>Niſus</hi> of the Muſcles; neither could thoſe Muſcles be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, but by a more abundant influx of the animal ſpirits overcoming this preſſure; nor could they be propell'd thro the compreſſed Nerves, unleſs they were puſht on by a greater force; and by this greater force is known that by which is meant to <hi>preſs;</hi> and therefore 'tis evident, that the blood thus filling its veſſels, may eaſily produce that ſenſe of <hi>Weight,</hi> as<note place="margin">The weight or heavineſs.</note> was ſaid. The blood, while in this fulneſs, becauſe of its bulk and the viſcidity it contracts, by this ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fulneſs, both in its own nature, and by reaſon of the diminution of its motion, is not ſo capable to ſeparate its ſubtile parts or animal ſpirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not ſo well divided or broken into ſuch ſmall particles. Now
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40814:23"/>
ſince the abundance and ſeparation of the ſpirits in the brain, are neceſſary for the motion of the muſcles, upon the contraction of which the ſtrength and activity of the whole body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; 'tis plain that in ſuch a caſe, where the motion of the blood is ſo languid, and the ſecretion of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpirits ſo ſmall; there will be a<note place="margin">Leſs Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</note> lazineſs and a <hi>diminution of activity over all the body.</hi> And becauſe this artificial Plethora, that leſſens the activity is very ſudden, <hi>i. e.</hi> in two or three days, this <hi>leſs activity</hi> will be ſudden<note place="margin">Sudden Weakneſs.</note> too, or a <hi>ſudden weakneſs</hi> will happen; which was to be ſhown. When the blood is thus ſtopt, and become very viſcid, 'tis evident that the body muſt proportionably want of its warmth; ſince that is only an effect of the greater liberty the ſmall parts of the blood, that make the heat, have, to diſperſe themſelves over the body; and this liberty is procur'd by the parts of the blood in their motion, juſtling and breaking each other into ſmaller parts. But the blood being viſcid or tough, is not ſo eaſily, in its nature, broken and diſſolved; and therefore the warmth is ſtill more
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40814:23"/>
violently lock'd up and confin'd. Moreover, while the blood is ſo viſcid, its motion is ev'n ſlower than natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it ſhould be; and conſequently the heat is leſſen'd, and the blood not ſo well divided, becauſe the breaking of it into ſmaller parts depends upon its motion. So that according as the motion is diminiſhed, and the force of the viſcidity greater, the <hi>coldneſs</hi> is proportionably greater <hi>over the whole</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coldneſs over the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> 
               <hi>body:</hi> and becauſe the blood hath its motion from the heart, and in its whole journey round the body, is ſtill loſing part of that motion, (for the reaſons aſſign'd before) more or leſs in reſpect of the wideneſs of the veſſels thro which it is propell'd, and their diſtance from the heart; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis evident, that that <hi>Coldneſs</hi> will not be ſo ſenſible in the parts that are nearer the heart, or about the heart it ſelf and the Thorax, as in the parts that are more remote or the <hi>extremities</hi> of the body; for, not only for the reaſons we have juſt nam'd, this Coldneſs is firſt felt in the parts that are furtheſt from the heart, but the motion of the muſcles in the extremities is not ſo ſtrong; and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40814:24"/>
therefore they do not ſo powerfully preſs the blood that glides thro thoſe veins and arteries, that go to the compoſing of theſe muſcles, as in the other muſcles, whoſe contraction is perform'd with greater force and energy; And conſequently the blood too, will be more apt to ſtagnate in thoſe remote parts than in the <hi>other;</hi>

               </note> ſo that this <hi>coldneſs</hi> will be more ſenſible in <hi>them,</hi> as was aſſerted. Moreover, the veſſels in thoſe remote parts, growing always ſmaller and ſmaller, the further they go; this thick blood will be propell'd with the greater difficulty thro theſe veſſels, than if they were wider; beſides, that by reaſon of the <hi>Glewineſs</hi> of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40814:24"/>
into the wide <hi>Sinus's;</hi> ſo that, tho the blood is very apt to ſtagnate, and produce that coldneſs in the extremities; yet that happens not ſo ſoon in the <hi>Brain.</hi> Now, the real<note place="margin">Except the Brain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> continuation of this coldneſs over the whole body, may be very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, if we conſider, that while the blood is thus ſtopt in the capillary arteries, we can aſſign no time in the whole circulation, in which a leſſer quantity of blood flows not from the arteries into the veins, than would have flown in a natural ſtate; and therefore a leſſer quantity of blood flowing more ſlowly, in the ordinary time of the circulation than is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally uſual, there will a leſſer than a natural quantity come into the heart in every contraction; and this ſmall quantity will not fill the arteries in that proportion, that is neceſſary to force it forward, ſo as to break and divide it, and to diſplay its heat. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the blood being in this tough and viſcid condition, there will ev'n be fewer of its fine and ſubtile parts ſeparated in the Brain, and diſpos'd of into the muſcles of the whole body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the heart in courſe will have a

fainter contraction, and a weaker power to propel the blood, which conſequently will not be ſo well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vlded, nor the heat ſo well diffus'd. Now ſuppoſing that this Lentor or Toughneſs could conſiſt with the natural motion of the blood, and that the viſcidity could not be broken or diſſolv'd by the natural motion, it cannot be expected it ever ſhould by a degree of motion, much below that which is natural; and therefore this ſenſe of cold muſt be felt in the other parts, and over the whole body. Pain is nothing elſe but a <hi>ſolution</hi> or <hi>disjoyning</hi> of <hi>continuous parts,</hi> and while the blood ſtagnates, and its quantity is conſtantly augmented, it muſt needs diſtend the ſides of its channels, where it ſtops, and <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſtretch the arteries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their ordinary pitch.

that ſurrounds and inveſts them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> called the <hi>Periostium:</hi> 'tis evident, that becauſe this may be affected with any ſort of pain, the bones are ſaid to be thus affected; and in <hi>beating</hi> there are great contuſions, <hi>i. e.</hi> the veſſels have their ſides ſo preſt, by the weight and motion of the inſtrument, by which theſe contuſions are made, that the blood either circulates very ſlowly, or not at all in thoſe ſections of the veſſels ſo compreſt. And the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſtium</hi> is either ſo preſt by the contus'd muſcles, that this feeling is produced in it; or, having its veſſels a little compreſt, the ſubſiſting liquors in the compreſt part do ſtop the ſucceeding liquors in the ſame channel, that they actually protrude the ſides of their veſſels, and make this ſenſation of pain: And ſince the blood in this accidental fulneſs and viſcidity may affect the veſſels after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, 'tis but natural to conclude, that ſuch a <hi>pain, as when one is beaten,</hi> may be produc'd in this ſtate of the maſs<note place="margin">As when one is beat.</note> of the blood.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40814:28"/>
is conſtantly added, and by the power of contraction in the arteries, that hinder this ſtuffing and bending out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of their ſides; ſo that this compreſſion being continually aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, at length its power will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come greater than the power of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion betwixt the viſcid and ſmall parts of the blood; and ſo the heat will be extricated, and give its ſenſe to the nerves: and after that ſome part of it is ſet at liberty, and moves to and fro with all freedom, it muſt mightily facilitate the ſetting at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the other ſmall parts from the viſcid parts of the blood, by wedging themſelves into them, and breaking their continuity; and making the viſcid parts themſelves more fluxil. Now ſince the hot and warm parts of the blood are delivered from their confining viſcid parts; becauſe the power of compreſſion is greater than the power of coheſion, which proceeds from that viſcidity; and ſince the power of compreſſion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the velocity of the blood, and its velocity is greateſt in theſe arteries that are next the heart; the power then of compreſſion in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40814:28"/>
thoſe arteries, that are next the heart, will be greater than in theſe that are more remote, <hi>i. e.</hi> the heat will be felt in the parts that are more remote from the heart, or the extremities, a great while after 'tis felt in the parts that are nearer the heart, and they have been warm; and the coldneſs in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote limbs, after the reſt of the body has been warm, may laſt even till the power of compreſſion in their arteries be augmented by the continual afflux of blood, and is able to ſubdue <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>the force of the viſcid and intangling parts; and ſince theſe two powers are uncertain and undetermined, there can be no time aſſigned, wherein this coldneſs may laſt in the remote limbs, after the reſt of the body has been hot; only we may aſſert, that the coldneſs will laſt the longer in the extremities, the more viſcid the blood is, and the more firmly and cloſely it envelopes and confines the heat. Thus a great deal of heat being ſet at liberty, it is derived with the other parts, that can eaſily be diſſolv'd and are more fluxile, into the veins; and therefore this heat being more free, rarifies and warms the blood it meets with in the

of life it ſelf: and in both theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects<note place="margin">They end in Death.</note> 'tis evident, how <hi>Death</hi> may be the fatal conſequence of this ſickneſs; for in the firſt, the blood being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very viſcid in the cold fit, or extremely rarify'd in the hot (by the patients own conſtitution, the heat of the place where he liveth, or warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicins) is ſo interrupted in the Arteries of the Brain, and being aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the ſucceeding blood, it may diſtend the ſides of the Arteries, and produce the named effect; or if the blood in the cold fit is ſo viſcid, and confines the ſpirits, that they cannot be ſeparated, or there be a real want of ſpirits in the blood, which turn to the ſame account; there can be no ſecretion of ſpirits, where there are none; and therefore there will none be derived into the Nerves, for the motion of the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and contraction of the heart. By the by, 'tis no leſs evident, that when the blood is thus infinitely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minuted, and ſtill broken down into parts leſſer and leſſer, by an indiſcreet management, and want of drinking of ſomething, that may be a body to the ſpirits; the blood is not only
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40814:31"/>
depriv'd of that Serum, that ſhould have preſerv'd its fluxility, and been that Body, but of its ſpirits too, and ſo muſt needs produce the fore-going effect, and make this melancholy tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy end at laſt in <hi>Death.</hi> Laſtly, ſince the ſick muſt continue in this condition, ſo long as the ſtate of the blood is in this way, and ſeeing thoſe parts, which are thus broken in this motion, may be carried off by the Glandules of the Skin, breaking open of the pipes, by the Inteſtins, &amp;c. and by theſe means the blood may be<note place="margin">Or the ſickneſs cur'd by Sweating, Hemor.

            <p>Thus having demonſtrated the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of theſe Symptoms, from the ſuppoſition of an Interruption of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,<note place="margin">The Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis.</note> I would proceed to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of the like nature, if I were not firſt oblig'd to vindicate this <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> from one that is <hi>merely</hi> ſuch, as I but lately promiſed: If therefore any one will take one, more, or all of theſe Symptoms, and let him have
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40814:32"/>
no reſpect to any hypotheſis, but read them backward, according to the known and familiar rules of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he ſhall find them neceſſarily proceeding from a real or factitious <hi>Fulneſs,</hi> which are the ſame as to their effects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſince we come by this fulneſs in our ordinary way of living, 'tis plain, that 'tis not that that is its cauſe: but there's no way elſe we can acquire it, except by retaining ſomewhat for ſome time we uſually loſe; and ſince 'tis not the firſt, the laſt is either by the ſuppreſſion of the ſecretions made by Stool, by Urine, in the Reſpiration, or by the Skin, or Perſpiration; now, we ſee the foregoing ſymptoms rendezvous'd into a great number, while neither the Evacuations by Stool, Urine, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration (the others I name not, they being very inconſiderable) ſeem to be much altered from what we ſee them in a natural ſtate; and therefore 'tis <hi>Perſpiration</hi> only, that is able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe effects and this <hi>Fulneſs,</hi> as I juſtly ſuppoſed. Moreover, <hi>Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> has taught us, by making out the proportions of ſecretions in the 5, 6,

            <p>The Perſpiration thus interrupted in hotter conſtitutious, hot Countries, or a warmer ſeaſon, theſe Fevers do not begin with ſo long a continued <hi>coldneſs,</hi> but the <hi>heat</hi> ſucceeds a great deal ſooner, as may be collected from what I'm to ſay hereafter, when I give ſome intimations of the ſickneſs of hotter Countries. Yet, the blood having ſometimes that velocity, we aſſign'd it to have, in another place, when it is moſt apt to make ſecretions by the Stomach, Inteſtines and Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea's; which ſecretions being ſent
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40814:33"/>
into the guts, in a greater or leſs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and finding them leſs conſtricted, and the humour thus ſeparated not ſo viſcid as to ſubſiſt, it muſt needs get out the natural way and produce a<note place="margin">Diarrhea's may be.</note> Looſeneſs: and tho the guts were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firmly ſhut, yet if there be ſuch a quantity, that the power of its <hi>Moles</hi> is greater, than the force whereby they are conſtracted, it will make way to it ſelf by the inteſtines, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But ſuppoſing the guts thus ſhut up, and the quantity ſo ſmall, that it cannot make its way by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, becauſe of its moles, yet if it's very thin, ſharp, and forced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, either by its own motion, or the compreſſion of the neighbouring parts, or both; ſo that it can dilate the guts, there will be a <hi>Looſeneſs,</hi> as is evident. But ſince in our way of living, and in the Channel, where the Air is ſeldom very ſultrie, 'tis but rare for our blood to be in theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances here required; and almoſt never but in ſcorbutical caſes; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall trouble you no further about this affair, but mind you, we are to account our Diarrhea's amongſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40814:33"/>
our accidental ſickneſſes, and to be treated as ſuch in theſe obſervations that make the ſecond part of this.</p>
            <p>Since we have ſeen, very plainly, theſe two different ways of the bloods being affected in an <hi>interrupted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,</hi> or a <hi>catcht Cold;</hi> there's a third, that in a colder ſeaſon, with the blood a little weakned; wherein not only the blood, but the reſt of the humours, contract ſuch a lentor and viſcidity, as we ſpoke of juſt now; yet, when 'tis comminuted, and has paſt the ſeveral ſtages, as before, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns again by a freſh ſupply of ſuch matter, that is able to produce the ſame, or like effects; and in the diſcovering of <hi>this,</hi> I ſhall uſe the ſame method, I did in the former, <hi>i. e.</hi> I ſhall endeavour to give a plain and genuine Hiſtory of the ſymptoms or appearances in that order they affect; and I ſhall unfold them, in a natural, familiar, and conceivable way; that we may be the better able to make ſuch inferences, that may be uſeful in our Practice. Firſt then, <hi>they feel a coldneſs after Dinner, their lips are pale, they tremble, their Pulſe is weak;</hi> while they are thus affected they have an

               <hi>inſenſibleneſs,</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> of <hi>mind,</hi> while all the <hi>external ſenſes are right,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>external ſenſes</hi> are <hi>faulty,</hi> when the <hi>mind</hi> is <hi>ſerene</hi> and thinks ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clearly, their whole <hi>body</hi> like a dead <hi>Corpſe,</hi> and have a great <hi>drought;</hi> yet inſtead of <hi>death</hi> comes <hi>warmth</hi> and <hi>heat,</hi> which laſts for ſome time and <hi>ends</hi> in <hi>ſweating;</hi> at this time the <hi>Pulſe</hi> is <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and more <hi>frequent</hi> than is uſual, they have a <hi>beating</hi> in their <hi>head,</hi> a great <hi>drought,</hi> and after the <hi>ſweating</hi> the <hi>Pulſe</hi> becomes ſometimes <hi>natural;</hi> It <hi>recurrs every day,</hi> every <hi>third</hi> or <hi>fourth day</hi> incluſive, and acts over the ſame <hi>Tragedy,</hi> it <hi>ends</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in <hi>death,</hi> and that in the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have ſeen very clearly in the foregoing part of this diſcourſe, that this viſcidity of the blood, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines the hot and ſmall parts, and makes it ſo apt to ſtagnate in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, and afterwards in the other parts, is the true and genuine cauſe of that coldneſs we obſerve; but the blood thus diſpos'd, and not actually ſtagnating, and producing this cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is reduc'd to act by any thing that has greater parts than the parts
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40814:34"/>
of the blood; ſo that they cannot be intimately mixed with the blood, and become one homogeneous body; and ſince the chyle is of ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as is here requiſite, as I have plainly ſhown in another place; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this viſcidity will have its power to make the blood ſtagnate, after the chyle has entered the blood, and not throughly comminuted by the lungs, ſo that the parts of the chyle may glide along equally with the parts of the blood. And ſince the chyle is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the other maſs into the lacteal veſſels in an hour and an half,<note place="margin">They feel a Coldneſs after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> or two hours after dinner; therefore in an hour and a half, or two hours after <hi>dinner,</hi> this <hi>coldneſs</hi> is <hi>felt.</hi> Now in this viſcid ſtate of the blood, it is more compact, and diſtends not its channels ſufficiently, and they, as 'twere, withdraw and diſappear; and becauſe the veſſels of the lips are more ſuperficial, and are only covered with a very thin skin, ſo that the blood in a natural ſtate, may almoſt, be ſeen running in theſe veſſels, and give that fine red we daily ſee; yet when the veſſels thus ſubſide, and withdraw, the blood is thicker and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40814:35"/>
and nothing remains to be ſeen but the genuine colour of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes and fibres, that compoſe theſe muſcles, and they being of a pale and Clay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>like colour, the <hi>Lips</hi> will be <hi>pale,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Their Lips are pale.</note> as was ſaid. The blood then being ſo viſcid, weak, and having the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſo confin'd, muſt needs ſeparate very few animal ſpirits for the reaſons often aſſign'd; and ſo the Nerves will be but not perfectly empty; now the motion of the ſpirits I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prov'd to be alternate, and the continual efflux to proceed only from the abundance of theſe ſpirits in the Nerves; and therefore, when at this time there are ſo few ſpirits ſeparated, this fulneſs of the Nerves ceaſes, and ſo muſt the continual efflux too; and their alternate influx muſt be more ſenſible, <hi>i. e.</hi> becauſe their motion is alternate, the motion of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling power being alternate, they flow alternately into the muſcles, theſe weights which they are to ſuſtain; and becauſe of that alternate influx, they are contracted alternately, and this alternate contraction of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſtial<note place="margin">They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that there muſt be a trembling in this want of animal ſpirits; tho Phyſicians have thought fit to expreſs it quite another way. Now, ſuppoſing that this viſcidity was ſo great, that it could even fill up the veſſels in the brain, and therefore the viſcid blood thus filling thoſe veſſels, being not ſo fit to ſeparate animal ſpirits, and in this diſtention of the full veſſels they do ſo compreſs the origin of the Nerves, that thoſe ſpirits are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived into the Nerves, and propell'd in that quantity into the heart, that's fit to make its contraction able to force out the blood into the Arteries, that they may affect our touch as uſually; and their ſides neither being diſtended ſo much, as in a natural ſtate, nor with ſo great a force, make that ſort of <hi>Pulſe</hi> which is called a<note place="margin">Their Pulſe is weak.</note>

Theſe Arteries then being ſtuff'd up, and fill'd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual afflux of new blood, their ſides will be more diſtended and bent out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; ſo that the Nerve that touches with them ſhall be compreſt; till at length by this continual ſtuffing, the Nerve is ſo totally compreſt, that it hinders the motion of the animal ſpirits, or at leaſt interrupts their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho the ſides of the Nerve are not quite ſqueez<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d together; and therefore it may very well happen, that one may be <hi>thick</hi> of <hi>hearing,</hi> or perfectly <hi>deaf,</hi> may not <hi>ſee, taſte,</hi> &amp;c. and yet recover of a ſudden, the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being over, and this lentor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded into the veins.

Yet before this ſweating, while the blood is thus commiuuted, there's both a greater quantity of animal ſpirits, and this quantity is faſter convey'd to the heart, and the heart<note place="margin">The Pulſe ſtronger and more frequent.</note> is oftner contracted, and that with greater force, and therefore the Pulſe will be <hi>ſtronger</hi> and more <hi>frequent,</hi> than in a <hi>natural</hi> ſtate. And becauſe of the great rarifaction and comminution of the blood, and its rapid motion, the ſides of the Arteries are diſtended to a greater pitch and very ſtrongly; therefore the more ſuperficial Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries going outward with a great deal of force, affect the parts that are touch'd by them, and produce that feeling and noiſe, that's convey'd to us, upon the <hi>beating</hi> of one <hi>body</hi> upon<note place="margin">They have beating in their head.</note> another. While the blood is thus hurry'd about in this rapid and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous motion, and no great ſecretions of any ſort; there is a great drineſs in our mouth, becauſe of the ſmall quantity of Spittle that is ſeparated,

Moreover, the heat thus diſſolv'd partly perſpires, as was ſaid; and is partly mixt with the reſt of the blood, and is not comminuted, the ſlowneſs in which the blood moves thro the veins giving ſufficient time for this mixture; and the heat may eaſily inſinuate it ſelf into the groſſer parts, and they may ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine this heat, and reſtrain its force by oppoſing this Penetration.

Tho then the paroxiſm is thus judg'd by the aſſigned perſpiration; yet if that viſcidity that produc'd the firſt, is not conſum'd, but returns in a certain time: or if that is conſum'd and purg'd off by ſome of the known ways of Excretion, or ſo comminuted, that it is chang'd into the nature of ſincere blood; yet the cauſe that produc'd the firſt viſcidity, produces its like that can laſt out the ſame time, affect with the like ſymptoms, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to ſincere blood like it; and ſo there are two ways of making theſe <hi>returns,</hi> as we ſee.

               </gap>ength; and therefore is more apt to ſeparate its ſmall and fine parts, and ſo to have a greater motion and all the conſequences that follow upon that: beſides, the Air too being very
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40814:44"/>
warm, the parts of the blood are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly rarify'd, take up an infinite ſpace, and diſtend the ſides of their channels to a great wideneſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the neighbouring parts, induce weakneſs, and ev'n break thro the ſmalleſt and thinneſt of their channels, overflow their banks, and produce all the inconveniencies, that might be made out according to the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd principles, if it was proper in this place.</p>
            <p>But as for thoſe ſickneſſes that are not peculiar to the Sea, but are alſo common to the Land, I ſhall conſider them as interloping diſeaſes in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of this Treatiſe; where I am to lay down the Indications for, and Method of Cure: but before I leave this part, I ſhall give a ſhort<note place="margin">Why I have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the common ſtories of Poyſon, &amp;c. Why Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> account why, in this explication, I have not us'd the accuſtomed ſtory of <hi>Poyſon,</hi> the <hi>Chymical Principles,</hi> and of <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkali;</hi> and then proceed to the obſervations themſelves, which make up the <hi>ſecond</hi> Part.</p>
            <p>And firſt, as to that poyſon, which ſome aſſert to be in the ſpirits, fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe Fevers, 'tis altogether unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd by its Patrons, and is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40814:44"/>
as yet; neither is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable for us to run ſtraight to the animal ſpirits for the ſolution of every Phenomenon, and to neglect the blood it ſelf, of which they are made, and which muſt be always ſuppoſed in demonſtrating their nature; and truly there can be nothing found in the moſt malignant Fevers, that does <hi>really</hi> diſtinguiſh them from any other continued Fever, for the whole diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that can be alledged, is <hi>ad majus &amp; minus,</hi> and I doubt not but that they may be naturally accounted for, by a greater or leſſer quantity of this lentor, its greater or leſſer coheſion, and its different ſolution. 'Tis better then to give laws to that boundleſs and unaccountable poyſon, ſo much ſpoken of by ſome Authors, tho ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom more than by the name, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as its counterpoyſon for a Cure, which would been very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, conſidering how great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences there are betwixt poyſons themſelves. But what ſeems the ſtrangeſt and moſt ſurprizing to me is, that if in a Family of ten or a dozen people, there is one whom we ſhould determine to have the beſt blood, to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40814:45"/>
be of the moſt athletick and robuſt habit of body, before the invaſion of this Malignant Fever; yet this one ſhall catch it the ſooneſt, and run the greateſt Riſque in his Life; while the more ſickly, aged, &amp;c. ſhall never feel it, or if he does, recover without any great care or pains. But, in ſhort, thoſe Fevers that are commonly reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd <hi>malignant,</hi> are not really different from the <hi>containing</hi> Fevers; and that they have their beginning from the ſame lentor that cauſes other Fevers, may be evident from this; that the moſt of thoſe malignant Fevers ſucceed theſe very Fevers, both quotidian and tertian, in which there are greater quantities of heat and humidity, that diſſolve this lentor; tho they come not ſo frequently after quartans, in which the viſcidity is greater, and the warm parts more confin'd: ſo a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle intermitting Fever eaſily degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into two intermitting Fevers, coming in the ſame time that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer did; they into two containing Fevers <hi>per ſubintrantiam,</hi> and they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one, which is quickly call'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant. And ſince all theſe changes are only certain degrees of this lentor,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40814:45"/>
as 'tis more or leſs tenacious, and ſticking to the veſſels; 'tis evident, that no more can be ſaid, but that the laſt of all theſe Fevers ſuceeeding in that order, or the <hi>formidable</hi> malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Fever, is of the very ſame ſtock with the reſt: and ſince they proceed gradually, from the ſmaller to the greater degrees of this lentor, this can only be ſaid to have its time in a greater degree of the lentor, as I inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated before.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Why the Chymical Principles.</note> As for the Chymical principles, they are ſo far from being ſimple, and having the requiſite properties of principles, as one of the learnedſt Chymiſts has demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that 'tis ſtrange any man ſhould adviſe us to aſſume propoſitions ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, in order to the explaining of Sciences, that have ſo uſeful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a practice; they think indeed, if they can tell us a ſtory of the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſome bodies, and give but a groſs gueſs at the ſtrength of their different <hi>menſtrua,</hi> they may very well undertake the explication of all the phenomena in nature, by their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſolutions and coagulations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have found out their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal diſſolvent, which might prove
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40814:46"/>
of very great uſe: but they muſt commit infinit miſtakes even in this, ſince they are intirely ignorant of thoſe powers, that give <hi>fluxility, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, motion</hi> and <hi>reſt</hi> to any Body, tho their <hi>fermentations, ſolutions</hi> and <hi>coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> depend upon them, as their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſappointments in their repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed practices muſt convince them, if the impudence, as well as ignorance, of the common Chymiſts were not incorrigible: and we ſhall find as little truth or ſolidity in their way of arguing concerning the ſtrength of their <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> if we purſue their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way of reaſoning; ſo little do they know of their own fam'd and belov'd <hi>Menſtrua.</hi> For when they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that ſuch a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> is corroſive, and produces ſuch effects by this power, 'tis evident, that <hi>corroſiveneſs</hi> being the productive cauſe of thoſe effects, then by adding ſomewhat elſe that is corroſive, it ſhould produce them better; whereas the contrary is ſo well known, that I ſhou'd not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any proof or inſtance, if I were not convinc'd they will deny what they daily ſee. Let us then take <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> which, they ſay, is able to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40814:46"/>
Silver, and diſſolve it into the moſt minute atoms, by its corroding power it has from the Vitriol and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, of which it is made; then, by adding another thing to the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is equally ſharp and corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, if not more, the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> ſhould in all reaſon act the more powerfully; and therefore by adding <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> which is a great deal more corroſive than Allom or Vitriol, it ſhould ſtill corrode the Silver more, which is ſo far from being true, that it is not able to make the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon it, unleſs the plate be extremely thin, and red hot, and not much then. And that Nitre and Sulphur, which is ſo much inflam'd in the blood, when we have a Fever; mixt together and burnt, make up the <hi>Sal prunellae,</hi> ſo much us'd in curing Inflamations and Fevers; but of this more hereafter: and I ſhall only add, that if the Chymical principles were allowed to have half the certainty their Authors pretend to, yet they never made them of uſe enough to us, ſince they were never able to give ſuch laws, by which we may have
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40814:47"/>
any certainty of the degrees and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Motion in their fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and <hi>Menſtrua:</hi> and ſince it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its different velocities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacts and occurrencies, with other bodies in a different ſtate, and in their ſeveral parts, that conſtitutes all the variety in the known world; our work ſhould be to enquire into that, and ſo we ſhould be better able to judge firmly of things, tho we muſt not debar our ſelves of any help, that may aſſiſt us in this diſquiſition. And truly, when a Chymiſt ſtumbles upon two or more liquors, that make a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious colour when mixt, he can ſay iuſt as much of it, as of a white, red, or yellow Ribband and no more; he can, perhaps, tell you how he made his Liquors, but how by their combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation they came to give this colour, he can give no better account than the Dyer of his Ribbands; ſo that while we advance no further, we are like to make a wonderful progreſs in the knowledge of things. Now becauſe the Chymiſts tell us, that a Fever is nothing but too great a quantity of ſulphur in the blood, or that too much exalted; let's enquire into its
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40814:47"/>
power of doing this and producing that effect. And that we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with more order and exactneſs, let us ſuppoſe this Rule, which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by all the Philoſophers, as moſt agreeable to the dictates of nature; namely, If any thing be ſuppos'd as a cauſe, and the effect always follows without the help of any thing elſe; we may, without doubting, aſſert and believe, that to be the productive cauſe of this effect: and on the contrary, if the pretended cauſe be there, and the effect follows not upon it; or if that which is ſaid to be the effect, be preſent without the cauſe, then that cauſe never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces that effect. And therefore ſince adding of ſulphureous Medicins to the blood, will not only heighten the power of the ſulphur in the blood, but produce more; 'tis plain that upon that addition we muſt always have a Fever; yet after the drinking ſalt and ſulphureous Bath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>waters, which are intimately mixt with the blood, and diſpos'd over all the body, we ſee no ſuch feveriſh fits produc'd. Yea in a Suppreſſion of Urine in the Stone, the ſharp and pungent ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40814:48"/>
ſalts of the Urine, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the maſs of the blood, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe feveriſh effects, which nevertheleſs are never obſerv'd to happen. Beſides, we know that we can pour a drachm or two of Oyl of Sulphur immediately into the blood of a live Dog by his blood veſſels; and after the veſſel, into which it is injected, is bound up with a moan or two, and the Dog ſet at liberty; he is ſo free and ſafe from any Fever, that he skips about full of health, and eats up whatever comes in his way for his purpoſe: and therefore if the blood, when altered with ſo great a quantity of Salt and Oyl of Sulphur, is not in the leaſt feveriſh; we muſt acknowledge that an alteration made in the blood by ſaline and ſulphureous juices and ſpirits, is not the productive cauſe of a Fever.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Why Acid and Alkali.</note> And laſtly, to diſcredit the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Acid and Alkali, it would be ſufficient to obſerve, that they who ſet up for it have not let us know what it is, when they tell us, that an Acid is that which can ferment with an Alkali; and we know, that ſome Medicins both ſimple and compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40814:48"/>
ferment with ſuch as are declar'd Acids, and then with others that are determined to be Alkalies; and it might ſeem very needleſs to alledge their ridiculous evaſion, but that they'll mumble it over at the reading of the objection; and 'tis this, that that Medicin contains ſome Acid and ſome Alkali in its parts, by which, in theſe two reſpects, it may ferment with both; and ſo by this ſettlement they make neither Acid nor Alkali, becauſe the bodies are mixt, and all mixt bodies partake and ſhare of all the principles, whatever they be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Philoſophers, and are ſaid to be of this or that nature, Acid or Alkali, which ever predominates, and bears the greateſt ſhare in the compoſition; and if they be ſuppos'd equal, our noble principles muſt ſcuffle for the Maſtery. And even tho this were partly allow'd, we might ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſprove this Hypotheſis, by conſidering any one diſeaſe, where we may find a vaſt number of not only antecedent cauſes, but other ſymptoms enumerated by Medicinal Writers, that can never be accounted for, either by an Acid or Alkali.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40814:49"/>
Yea ſo much are its Patrons in the dark about their principle, that we find them daily betray'd into the greateſt abſurdities. For inſtance, its great ſtickler Dr. <hi>Blankard,</hi> who is follow'd by all the reſt, has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declar'd, in a whole ſyſtem of practice he compos'd according to thoſe principles, that all Diſeaſes proceed from the faultineſs of the Acid only, which is the moſt ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous thing can be ſaid in a few words: for ſuppoſing, that Acids and Alkalies are the true Ingredients or Components of bodies, and that they concurr as principles in their action, and bear contre-parts in this action; then, becauſe the influence of either upon the other, may be augmented, diminiſhed or loſt, and this is to be faulty or vitious; therefore 'tis evident, that either of 'em may have its defects, and conſequently that the blame ſhould not be entirely laid upon one.</p>
            <p>I hope, by this time, no reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon will cenſure me, for not ſpeaking a language, which neither I nor its Admirers can underſtand, when I declare my

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40814:53"/>
and poſitively maintain that to be the only ſafe method, and all others fatal and pernicious. But thoſe Countries too, that are ſettled to one ſort of practice, ſo ſoon as by ſome altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Seaſon, (perhaps to the better) and other circumſtances of Curing, they find their way not to anſwer, and to be more uncertain (if any thing can be more ſo than a ſet practice); then the Diſeaſe is <hi>malignant, quite new, mankind chang'd,</hi> &amp;c. which would make people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that, whatever certainty there may be in Medicin, yet there is little or none in the cure of Fevers. But beſides all theſe miſtakes, there is ſtill another more conſiderable one, of which very many are guilty; and that is, becauſe we ſee, that all theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ways of practice, are and have been ſucceſsful in different Ages and Countries; therefore we may uſe them promiſcuouſly, and all at once; whereas we ſhould alſo conſider the conveniencies for putting them in practice, and the way how we expect they are to produce their effects; and, becauſe in the abovemention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d methods, the way of performing the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40814:53"/>
one is quite oppoſite to the other, we ſhall ſeldom, if ever, ſucceed by doing all at once; and we are to bear with, any method already begun, and endeavour to make the beſt of it, even tho it is not the moſt genuine, natural, and convenient; and muſt never venture upon any other in acute diſeaſes, of which we ſpeak, if it has been continued for ſome time.</p>
               <p>But to return to our ſubject; if we<note place="margin">What our thoughts are about the former intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> reflect upon the Theory demonſtrated in the firſt part of this, 'twill be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that becauſe this diſeaſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds always, with us at leaſt, from an <hi>interruption of perſpiration,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the maſs of blood is corrupted and vitiated, by the quantity of the ſteams thus detain'd, that the genuin and natural way of curing this, is by evacuation, either according to the quantity of the detain'd moles; or at leaſt in ſuch a proportion, as may ſet the parts of the blood at greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and ſo, becauſe the different ſecretions depend upon the different degrees of the bloods velocity, when the blood acquires a velocity, like that which is natural, it will alſo have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40814:54"/>
ſecretions, and in this manner be reduc'd to its natural Contact and Coheſion, <hi>i. e.</hi> it will be propell'd in its ordinary and natural way, and the Patient will recover his health; ſince health is nothing elſe but the moſt natural circulation of the blood. Now ſince Evacuation thus perform'd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers our Deſigns in Curing Fevers, both by leſſening the quantity and altering the maſs, 'tis certain, that all the conſequences drawn from the former intimations are juſt, and may be put in practice upon <hi>reaſonable</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The next queſtion may be, which of all the mentioned ways may be the moſt natural and convenient for a general Practice: and ſince <hi>Blooding, Sweating,</hi> and <hi>Purging,</hi> are moſt commonly received among us, I ſhall enquire which of theſe we may moſt generally depend upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What of Bleeding, Sweating and Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> And firſt, ſince both they that allow of Sweating, and they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend Purging for the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Practice, affirm that Blooding is agreeable for both their deſigns, there is no occaſion left for diſputing about the Neceſſity or Uſefulneſs of that Operation, if the neceſſary cautions
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40814:54"/>
be obſerv'd with regard to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of blood that ought to be taken away, ſo that the controverſy lies intirely betwixt Sweating and Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I ſhall endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine with all the impartiality imaginable, and that by enumerating the advantages and inconveniencies of both. And firſt, becauſe the ſecretion by the pores, is double of all the other ſecretions in the reſt of the body; 'tis plain, where this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion can be perform'd, that there may be a greater quantity ſeparated from the blood, in a certain time, than may be by all the other ways together in the ſame ſpace of time; ſo that for that reaſon it may ſeem the moſt convenient and agreeable; yet ſince it muſt be excited by Medicins, that ſupply the blood with ſpirits, and conſequently unlock the ſpirits of the blood, that are confin'd by its viſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; if thoſe Medicins be given to ſick people, that are young, have an abundance of blood, and that very rich, 'tis plain that they muſt ſo break and divide the parts of the blood, and excite ſuch a velocity, by which few or no ſecretions of any ſort are made,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40814:55"/>
as we ſee but too often in our daily practice; and therefore this practice can only agree with thoſe that are older, and have not ſo rich blood. I need not give my judgment about the other two ways of provoking Sweat, ſince they are not in uſe with us; yet I think it will not be far from the purpoſe, to remember you of a ſtory Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> tells us, in his Book of Fevers, of a young woman that lay ill, and was his Patient, and for whom he had preſcrib'd a great many Medicins, that might <hi>judge</hi> her Fever by Sweating, but all to no purpoſe; and at laſt, I think, he gave her two Drachms of the Spirit of Harts-horn, but nothing like Sweating appear'd: on the contrary, her <hi>Pulſe</hi> was <hi>higher,</hi> ſhe was very <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>delirious;</hi> and among the reſt of her idle talk, being doubtleſs incited by an extraordinary drought, ſhe deſir'd to go a ſwimming, and up ſhe got for her Journey; but was kept in, till her friends reſolving to humour her, concluded to carry her to the water; and accordingly, they not living far from the River, carry'd her down (whether with the Doctors conſent I remember not)
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40814:55"/>
and when they had ſecur'd her from ſinking, or going too far out of their reach, at length threw her into the water; and, after ſhe was brought out again, was put to bed, where ſhe ſweat off her Fever. Some ſuch like caſes happen very often to our Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who, in the time they are deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or have Calentures (this word our Surgeons uſe for violent Fevers, yet 'tis only a general word in <hi>Spain</hi> for a Fever) when lying in their Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocks in a calm Summers day, they ſee the Sea thro the Gun-Ports very plain and ſmooth, and imagining it to be a green Meadow, get up a walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and fall into the Sea, if they are not ſtopt in their way; but if they get at laſt into the Sea, and are taken up and laid into their Hammocks, they ſweat very plentifully, and ſhake off their Fever. I do not take notice of theſe inſtances, with a deſign to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade people to ſuch a practice, while we can perform the Cure a great deal better; but only to be an example in practice for the propoſition I have eſtabliſh'd in a Theory of the velocity of the blood ſomewhere elſe, and nam'd juſt now. And I think that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40814:56"/>
propoſition is very well confirm'd by theſe inſtances: ſince we ſee, that this rapid motion of the blood in this dilirious and mad ſtate is check'd by the coldneſs of the water; and being thus check'd ſends out abundance of its parts by ſweating, as I alledg'd.</p>
               <p>Upon the other hand, if purging Medicins can evacuate as much out of the blood, as the moles that's detain'd amounts to, without heightening, or at leaſt not conſiderably, the motion of the blood; then that will be a more certain practice, and no leſs reaſonable than the other. Now, I could make it plain, by a great many experiments, that the detain'd ſteems, that produce theſe ſymptoms, we find in Fevers, do not exceed three or four <hi>lib.</hi> and ſince 'tis agreeable with our daily obſervation, that we can give Medicins that evacuate by Stool, a greater quantity without heating the body: Therefore 'tis very evident that the adminiſtring of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicins that evacuate by Stool, will be a more certain and ſafe way of curing Fevers. But whatever may be ſaid on this ſubject, I admire how that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice can be thought agreeable at Sea,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40814:56"/>
where there is ſo piercing and ſharp an Air for, at leaſt, eight months of the year, that none that's overheated by any violent exerciſe, would think it convenient to go into, and far leſs to take a ſweating Medicin in it. This matter then being clear, I proceed to the way of curing our Patient; and becauſe bleeding not only brings down the moles to a natural quantity, but ſets at liberty the ſpirits thus huddled up; and his Pulſe beating but about ten ſtrokes leſs than natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, I order'd twelve ounces of blood to be taken away, and preſcrib'd him ſix grains of <hi>Tartarum Emeticum</hi> next morning; that there might be no conveyance of any thing from the ſtomach, that might confirm the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion of the ſtagnating parts, but might even break and divide thoſe that were already in a ſtagnating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for the reaſons to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd hereafter. Having thus been let blood in one day about ten a clock in the morning, and next day his Vomit working very well; about four a clock in the afternoon of that next day, his Pulſe was at leaſt ten or twelve ſtrokes higher than naturally,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40814:57"/>
and therefore he took a doſe of the following Powder, to reſtrain that growing motion about the evening.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Obſerv. 8.</note> Mr. <hi>Nobs,</hi> Purſer to the <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was taken after Dinner with a cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and trembling, which laſted ſix hours; his Pulſe was all the while extremely depreſs'd, and beat not above 40 ſtrokes in a minute; then came the warmth, which firſt begun about the trunk of his body, and was afterwards diffus'd over all. As it encreaſed, he grew very reſtleſs, and his Pulſe became very quick and ſtrong; till at laſt he began to ſweat, and his heat abated proportionably as the ſweating encreaſed. He was well for the reſt of that day and all the next, but was troubled with a looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the third day he was taken ill again, and ſuffered over all the former ſymptoms.</p>
               <p>'Tis very plain from what I ſaid in<note place="margin">The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cure.</note> the firſt part of this Book, that that viſcid and ſlimy <hi>Lentor,</hi> which firſt ſtagnates in the capillary Arteries, and then in theſe larger Veſſels, muſt be broken and divided, that it may be made a ſubſtance capable of being carried round the body without ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40814:63"/>
or ſtagnating. And becauſe this Lentor has its ſupply from the <hi>primae viae,</hi> the Liver or other <hi>viſcera</hi> that are ſaid to ſeparate liquors, by ſome or all of theſe liquors being viſcid; we muſt endeavour to cut off and intercept that ſupply, and to break and render fluxil the liquors that are thus tough and viſcid. Now from which of all theſe this lentor proceeds and is ſupply'd, is not always very evident, tho ſometimes it may happen to be ſo. Let us firſt ſuppoſe then, that this ſupply comes wholly from the <hi>primae viae;</hi> and upon this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we may conclude, that thoſe things which empty the ſtomach and inteſtines of thoſe impurities will do the buſineſs effectually. And becauſe a <hi>Vomit</hi> performs that work with the greateſt certainty, then a Vomit would be all that's requiſit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat that Cure, and the more gentle it is, 'twould be more for the eaſe of the Patient and ſatisfaction of the Phyſician. But I have proved before, that the other <hi>viſcera</hi> may diſcharge ſome of their vitiated liquors into the blood, which not being chang'd into the perfect nature of the blood, they
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40814:64"/>
ſtagnate in the Capillary Arteries in that quantity and way, that are fit to produce the foregoing Phaenomena. And they being in ſuch circumſtances, as make them fit to affect the blood, 'tis evident that thoſe faulty and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humours muſt be broken and divided, that they may be fitted to circulate with the blood without ſtagnating; and that the blood, which is thus affected, muſt be reduced to a ſtate of greater fluxility. If they had their viſcidity from the <hi>primae viae,</hi> that work could be done very eaſily; but 'tis certain that the blood may be infinitly chang'd, without any fault in theſe firſt paſſages; and the <hi>viſcera,</hi> that are now affected, muſt have their juices altered, or elſe they will ſtill be in a condition to give a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſupply, ſuppoſing the blood to be otherwiſe in a good condition. Now the only way that liquors, which ſtagnate in their channels, can be propell'd and made fluxil is, by ſome power that may compreſs, break and divide the liquors thus ſtagnating; and becauſe this breaking and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding muſt be perform'd by ſomewhat, that contracts or violently compreſſes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40814:64"/>
the obſtructed parts, and breaks the ſtagnating juices; and this can only be perform'd by the contraction of the muſcles, and their compreſſing the <hi>viſcera,</hi> that are near them; therefore the moderate exerciſe of thoſe Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles will be very agreeable: but in our natural or voluntary contractions, they have not that violence, that is neceſſary to make a ſufficient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion fit to break and divide this lentor. And ſince there are a great many Muſcles, that are obſtructed, and could have ſufficiently broken the ſtagnating liquors in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>viſcera,</hi> that cannot be moved and contracted by the power of our <hi>Will;</hi> ſome way muſt be contriv'd to make ſuch a violent contraction of thoſe Muſcles eſpecially, that are able to compreſs the neighbouring <hi>viſcera;</hi> and if we examine all the conſequences that attend the giving of any Medicin, we ſhall find none that exerciſes more Muſcles, and that with greater violence than <hi>vomiting;</hi> for not only the Muſcles of the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax</hi> and <hi>Abdomen</hi> are contracted with a prodigious force, and are able, by their contraction, to compreſs the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40814:65"/>
                  <hi>Lungs, Stomach, Liver, Spleen,</hi> or any thing that may be contained in them, and in all their capacity, but even the whole Muſcles of the Body are affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore 'tis <hi>vomiting</hi> only that can produce the required effect. Thus we have demonſtrated the way of cutting off the ſupply of this lentor, that is made by the <hi>primae viae</hi> and the <hi>viſcera,</hi> that are ſaid to contain liquors; ſo that if there were not ſuch a ſeaſon of the year, in which the viſcidity of the blood is much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted and augmented, the blood extreamly weakned and diſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with repeated paroxyſms or otherwiſe, this diſeaſe might be conquer'd by theſe very means. But when the Air is foggy, moiſt and cold, and the blood weak, we muſt have reſpect to that, if we will cure our Patient; and ſuch things muſt be given, that may make the blood richer and maintain its fluxility.</p>
               <p>We have an infinit number of Medicines, that are ſaid to produce ſuch effects; but the long, tedious and unſucceſsful practice of former ages convinces us of the contrary. We heard indeed a great deal of ſpecifick
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40814:65"/>
Medicins of oppoſit powers; but never ſaw any thing, that deſerv'd that name before the <hi>Indian B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Indian Bark</hi> then, or <hi>Jeſuits Powder,</hi> being by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that Specifick we deſir'd, we ought not to neglect it, tho it was not found in a <hi>Matras.</hi> But not to inſiſt upon experience in a thing, where we have ſo many reaſonable proofs, tho <hi>that,</hi> of its ſelf, is a ſufficient proof: for we ſee how the ſinking and languiſhing Pulſe is rais'd by the taking of it, and that without any burning and extraordinary warmth; <hi>i. e.</hi> we find it has ſuch a power as is able to introduce a freer motion, which cannot be done but by freeing the confin'd ſpirits, that they may be ſeparated in due time and proper place. And ſince this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

breaking the viſcid blood, and this <hi>attrition</hi> is the thing required; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Jeſuits Powder, <hi>Quinquina,</hi> &amp;c. anſwers our deſire, and gives us what we require. Now, tho 'tis plain that the Jeſuits Powder produces this effect, it is not the Jeſuits Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as ſuch, or its name alone, that is able to charm and lull aſleep this intermitting Fever; but ſince we ſee plainly that it can do ſo, we ſhould give it in a ſufficient quantity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that effect; and when we give it, to be ſure it may be carried into the blood: For if this be not done, 'tis quite as good, if not better, to keep it in the Paper and look upon it, and from that to expect your Cure, than to take it into a foul ſtomach, full of thick impurities, there to be clogg'd up in impure matter, and perhaps to be carried out of the body with the excrements, or elſe to be carried in this condition into the maſs of blood to the misfortune of the Patient: or, if neither of theſe happen, given in the time of a <hi>Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> to be immediately carried off by Stool, and never reaching the blood to communicate its <hi>efficacy</hi> and <hi>vertue.</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:40814:66"/>
As to the way how its effect is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, I know not, nor ever ſhall, without a revelation from that Being, who knows the determined motion, ſize of the parts, and the different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion of matter, that produce the modified bodies we ſee; and yet, I think, there may be ſufficient cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty to aſſiſt us pretty exactly in doing ſuch things, as the ſupport of our infirm nature may require. For, conſidering the nature of intermitting Fevers, of which we are as certain as of any thing in Phyſicks, and that we have a Medicin, that alters the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the blood and makes it more fluxil; and this fluxility being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd in a certain way, therefore the China China is endu'd with a like power to that which makes the blood fluxil. This knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have of the Barks efficacy, without the knowledge of its conſtituent parts is ſo ſure, that we can deduce very certain and almoſt infallible Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from it, and this one for inſtance; If this Powder be able to break, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, and make fluxil our viſcid blood, then in a ſtate where the blood is faulty thro its <hi>fluxility, richneſs;</hi> and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40814:67"/>
                  <hi>extraordinary motion,</hi> this Powder is never to be given; ſo that in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Fever, where the blood is ſuch, the Jeſuits Powder muſt be very noxious; and 'tis very obvious to every mans Obſervation, that the more the blood is in theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the conſequence is always the more fatal. I cannot omit what that candid Relater of Medicinal caſes Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> ſays, in the 36 <hi>p.</hi> of of his Letters, as they are printed in the Edition of his book in 1685, at <hi>London:</hi> 
                  <q>At in <hi>Peſte</hi> atque <hi>Epidemicis continuis,</hi> quae eandem ordine excipient, debellandis, non alios effectus ex ejus uſu expectare licet, quam eos, quos hodie in <hi>Pleuritide, Peripneumonia, Anguina,</hi> ac id genus <hi>Febribus inflammatoriis</hi> videmus, quibus non tantum non prodeſt, ſed &amp; plane obeſt.</q> But in curing the <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>continual Epidemicks,</hi> which will orderly follow theſe, no other effects are to be expected from <hi>it,</hi> than theſe we now find it produces in a <hi>Pleuriſie, Peripneumonia, Quinſey,</hi> and ſuch other <hi>inflammatory Fevers,</hi> in which caſe 'tis not only uſeleſs, but evidently hurtful. But whatever may be thought of my pretended
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40814:67"/>
certainty; 'tis at leaſt as well grounded as a great many maxims in the Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticks, &amp;c. which no Ship-Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Man of ſenſe doubts of; but on the contrary, finds all his calcula<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions and inferences orderly made, to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anſwer his expectation in his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
               <p>The Chymiſts at preſent are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in an extraordinary buſtle and ſmoak with their fire and <hi>menſtrua,</hi> to reſolve by their Inſtruments which they do not underſtand, the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts of this Specifick; and at laſt tell us that 'tis a <hi>Roſin,</hi> and that its power in curing Agues is lodg'd in its Roſin, which is as much in plain <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> as the firſt queſtion; and we underſtand juſt as much, when they tell us of its vertue being in its Roſin, as if they had told us, that it is in the Bark. We know indeed that its tincture, made with any ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, is the ſtrongeſt, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis the property of Roſins to be beſt diſſolv'd in Spirits; 'tis plain that this Bark contains a great deal of Roſin, which is all that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from this experiment. But to proceed, let us ſuppoſe, that all the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40814:68"/>
vertue is extracted in this Roſin, which cannot be pretended (becauſe of a like experiment of its yielding its ſanative power in common water) yet we ſhall ſtill be as much puzzled about the way of this Roſins work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the working of the Bark in Powder, before it was a Roſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if they think they have anſwered the queſtion, by telling us that it produces theſe effects, as it is a Roſin, then all other Roſins will do the ſame; and therefore, they may truſt to the Roſin of Jalap, or any other they're oblig'd to by their principles; and we ſhall have an opportunity to obſerve the concluſion.</p>
               <p>The other way, that has been taken, to account for the vertue of the Bark, is by imagining it to be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent;</hi> a power quite deſtructive of the requiſits, we have clearly laid down for curing an Ague; and no leſs repugnant to common obſervation, as I ſhall demonſtrate. What has been the foundation of this aſſertion, I could no where find out ſo clearly, as in a Diſcourſe written by one of the Members of the Royal Society, I think in the year 1678; where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuting
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40814:68"/>
the power of the Bark in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Agues, he ſays, that if the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent be troubled with a <hi>looſeneſs</hi> while he is taking the Jeſuits Powder, it can have no ſucceſs; therefore, ſays he, the Bark has its power in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way, and is <hi>aſtringent;</hi> then he ſubſumes for his own purpoſe, that, becauſe it is aſtringent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it muſt be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hurtful in a diſeaſe that muſt be cur'd by evacuation. To paſs by at this time, our Author's neglecting to prove that this diſeaſe muſt be cur'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y evacuation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I very much doubt for the reaſons intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; I have ſaid enough already to evince the weakneſs of his Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'Tis ſtrange, that one ſhould expect, that any kind of Medicins, which produce not their effect in a minute, but require ſome hours, at leaſt, to affect the blood; ſhould exert their vertue, when they never come thither; and this being the caſe of the Jeſuits Powder in a Looſeneſs, we may eaſily conclude, that the Quinquina will not cure an Ague in that caſe, whether it be aſtringent or not. By the bye, ſince I have had occaſion to examine this argument
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40814:69"/>
againſt the Barks power of curing Agues, I cannot forbear taking notice of another very good argument this Author brings for the poiſonous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Bark, and that is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment from its hindering the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of Yeſt and Wort; that, becauſe if a due quantity of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits Powder be caſt into Wort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Yeſt is added, the Wort never ferments, and therefore this Powder is poiſonous. I confeſs, I know not how to anſwer an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I do not comprehend; but if every thing that hinders the fermentation of Yeſt and Wort be poiſonous; what muſt become of us poor Mortals in the poiſonous times either of a froſty or very hot ſeaſon, for the Brewers find their Ale and Beer ferment but very ill in ſuch ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: and beſides, Sugar, Spirit of Harts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> horn, &amp;c. poured into Wort in a due quantity hinder its fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; yet they were never reckon'd among the number of Poiſons: But, on the contrary, if I thought the Hypotheſis of Acid and Alkali tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, I ſhould like the Bark the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the experiment this Author
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40814:69"/>
has helpt me to: for in that way, the blood in an Ague is viſcid, by the power of the coagulating Acid, which can only be deſtroy'd by a powerful Alkali, ſuch as this experiment proves the Bark to be.</p>
               <p>Now as for the aſtringent power aſſerted, becauſe it is ſo, and for no reaſon yet aſſign'd, is very ridiculous: and if it cur'd Agues as it is aſtringent, then as ſtrong, or more powerful aſtringents would have the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which is contrary to any trial or obſervation can be made: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, we know 'tis uſed every day with the beſt ſucceſs in Hyſterical Fits, and the Suppreſſion of Womens Monthly Courſes, where no body ever adviſed ſo powerful an aſtringing Medicin, as they would have the Bark to be.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, we have ſeen ſome ill ſymptoms appearing after the giving the Powder; but the Queſtion is, whether theſe ſymptoms are the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe's, the Bark's, or the Phyſitian's; and this I ſhall endeavour to reſolve, by following out <hi>Helvetius,</hi> a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian in <hi>France,</hi> who has lately writ a Book, he dedicates to the <hi>French</hi> King,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40814:70"/>
and allows a great many of them to be owing to the Powders being given by the Mouth, and contrives a new way of giving it, and that by Clyſters. I ſhall firſt then enquire, how far his allowance is good, and to be follow'd, and what's to be thought of his new practice; which, I think, will be very obliging. But before I do this, 'twill be neceſſary to ſhew, that I have not forgot my Obſervation; and therefore when I have related one or two more I ſhall come to thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.</p>
               <p>And firſt, becauſe Mr. <hi>Nobs</hi> was troubled with a Looſeneſs; and that it might not hinder the Operation of the Vomit, I intended to give him for the preceding reaſons, the night before I preſcrib'd him the following Bolus to be taken going to bed.</p>

               <p>This was one Mr. <hi>Humble</hi> in the <hi>Grafton,</hi> to whom I was call'd <hi>May</hi> 1694, at <hi>Spithead,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Leckie,</hi> who was then Surgeon to that Ship. He was firſt taken with a Tertian Ague, for which he was put aſhore; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſtaid out his time, he came back with it upon him, for he was ſome Officer or another, and ſo would not leave the Service; and expecting

his Cure aboard, he was taking ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing all that time, but to no advantage. So, when I was call'd he had a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and his cold Fit uſed to laſt him ſome four or five hours, his hot or Fever Fit one hour, or an hour and a half, and then ſweat: he was brought very low. I ask'd him when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the next Fit, and he told me to morrow about eight in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for it ſhifted forward and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, from Tertian to Quotidian, from Quotidian to Tertian, from a Quartan to a Hemitritaea, and from that to a Quartan again. I ordered him to take iv grains of Emetic Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar that morning, about 6 a clock; which had juſt done working as his Fit begun to come upon him; his cold Fit after his Vomit laſted two hours, his hot Fit two hours, and ſo went off by the Sweating. I had been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Surgeon about the giving him the Jeſuits Powder; but he told me he had been ſo often let blood, purg'd, and taken ſo much of the Powder aſhore and aboard, that he could not take more; and therefore I was reſolved to try the Powder, my learned Collegue Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends

begin its uſe a ſecond time upon the occaſion of a Relapſe. And therefore 'twas, that thinking upon the train of diſagreeable circumſtances, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this Remedy, I have diſcovered this more convenient way of giving it, whereby we may enjoy all its good effects, and evite all that's troubleſom in it.

long as is poſſible; and there be ſome people that can keep them but a very little time, we muſt add for thoſe, half an ounce of the Syrup of White Poppies to the Powder of Quinquina, which will mightily conduce to the keeping the Remedy without any trouble.</p>
               <p>We muſt obſerve, that thoſe that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">page </seg>12</label> can keep it but a little time, muſt continue its uſe the longer, to do that by a greater number that cannot be done by one, and ſo to promote the Cure.

'tis not beſide the purpoſe to take notice at this time, that thoſe Clyſters not having a purgative faculty, and not being given for that end, the ſick people need not be diſquieted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, if they ſee not an Evacuation of Bile and other Humours; as in our ordinary Clyſters.</p>

He adds in the next paragraph, that the people that have the Piles, are the only to whom he gives not theſe Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Clyſters; either not in ſo great a quantity, becauſe the rough Powder, rubbing up the veſſels in the paſſing, is apt to provoke the Piles, or elſe he gives a ſtrong decoction of it, which does almoſt as well, and entirely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents this inconvenience,</p>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40814:77"/>
any thing, may claim and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate a little too much to himſelf; except the practice or opinion he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances be, without controverſy, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than thoſe that were eſtabliſhed and thought of before: and therefore to ſpeak my mind freely, without a Navy Phyſitian's declaring war againſt a <hi>French</hi> Doctor, I think that this Trial may ſtand us in very good ſtead, upon the pinch of ſaving the life of one, who rather chuſes to die than taſte this Medicin; and of theſe there are very few: but I ſhould judge that man very raſh, that would recede from the known way of giving the Jeſuits Powder he has found ſo ſafe, that nothing can be more; and would go to a practice ſo very doubtful, and hardly preſs'd with the ſame difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, can be brought againſt the taking it by the Mouth, upon any leſſer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; as we ſhall ſee immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by the anſwering his Arguments, which I ſhall do with as great brevity and clearneſs as I can.</p>
               <p>As to the weight and pain ſome feel in their Stomachs, after having taken the Jeſuits Powder, 'tis certainly a very great inconvenience; but ſhall
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40814:78"/>
be judg'd by all the world, if that ſwelling they feel in their Bellies be not quite as ill, and can ſooner breed a Dropſy, Jaundice, &amp;c. than any diſeaſe that can be ſo ſoon brought on by it: beſides, if we will be at the trouble to look back to what I have ſaid, in the firſt part of this Book, about that ſymptom of an Ague, <hi>the weight in the Stomach;</hi> he ſhall ſee it clearly made out, that this weight is nothing but a heap of undigeſted and ſlimy ſtuff that's lodged there; and therefore of it ſelf is apt to make the neceſſary ſupply, to keep up the force of the Ague; and intercept too, any Medicins that are given in by the Mouth for its Cure, as I have ſaid ſince I begun to ſpeak of Agues. And if he would perſuade us to the uſing his Clyſters in theſe circumſtances, we ſhall never be able to cure this Ague, tho they were ſuppoſed to have a hundred times the force he pretends to: whereas if we give a Vomit to make a clear paſſage, we ſhall fell no ſuch inconvenience, but eſpecially if the Fit were well judged before we began our Medicin; and ſo this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint comes more from the neglect of

And ſo the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will go no further than this. Opium, Steel, Antimony, &amp;c. have been given in very ill times, and too great quantities, and no doubt there's been abundance kill'd ſo; but for all that, ſhould we leave off the uſe of theſe Medicins? no ſurely; and they will prove uſeful and noble Medicins in good hands. But why may not our Author try, what a decoction of the Powder he uſes for Clyſters upon certain occaſions, can do, to ſhun this inconvenience of the Powder; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince our learned Collegue Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> had publiſhed, ſome two years before this Author wrote his Book, ſuch a decoction for this very end; which would have prevented moſt misfortunes from that hand, when we know not this fit time to give a Vomit.</p>
               <p>Then for the ſecond inconvenience, 'tis much of the ſame kind; and if any one will conſider the proof I brought for the way how the Bark had its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40814:79"/>

thought the groſs parts of any body the leaſt capable to produce heat; and to guide all this right, he tells us, that <hi>Nature</hi> keeps it juſt ſo long, and not one half ſecond longer, than was neceſſary to ſeparate thoſe ſanative parts from its groſſer hot parts; this is indeed wonderful, but ſhe that can do all this, why did ſhe put him to the trouble of contriving Syrup of White Poppies, to cauſe ſome to keep their Clyſters longer, and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clyſters to help others off with theirs; I'le help him out for once, and remember him that Nature's of the ſhe-kind, and he's an old man. But of this Banter too much. The reſt of his Citations are about the way of giving it, which I have nothing to do with here; tho I thought fit to ſhew them, if any one be for them; and all the reſt may be comprehended in this, that they may be better given his way, becauſe, as he ſays, the Bark is given in ſubſtance, and in a greater quantity. And firſt, I believe all the Phyſitians in <hi>France,</hi> at leaſt all or moſt here, give it in ſubſtance, and have done theſe thirty y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40814:80"/>
our ſix Drachms muſt turn to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er account than his three ounces, and allow him ten more; and this we ſhall make very plain, by conſidering that betwixt the lower end of the <hi>Duodenum</hi> to the end of the <hi>Ileon,</hi> there are infinite numbers of Lacteal Veſſels to be ſeen, whereby this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, its Tincture made in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and other parts, may be very eaſily carry'd into the blood, and by which is carry'd of one ſubſtance and another, at leaſt, 3, 4, 5 pounds in a day, and ſo may be a very good way for 3 drachms, ℥ſs, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vi, or ℥j, of this Powder, however digeſted and prepared in a clean Stomach; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in his way, all the Lacteals that are ſaid to be there, are ſuppoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ill made experiments, and not one to be ſeen; and ſo, I think, our ſix drachms can produce more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful effects than his thirteen ounces, we have allow'd him; but ſuppoſe all the Colon were as full of Milky-Veſſels, as the Milky-way is full of Stars (which we ſee he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

length; which will be very evident to any one, that will bring into his thoughts, or lay before his eyes the Guts in their natural poſture, and any one with a Clyſter-Syringe impelling the Liquor; I ſay, if he conſiders this, he ſhall have no great difficulty to agree to my aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for firſt, if they were ſuppoſed full, then 'tis evident the reſiſtance of the Excrements were to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for; and perhaps this would do the buſineſs: but now, we'll ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them perfectly empty, and their ſides flaccid, as we ſee them at that time; then, upon the one hand let us remember, that the motion they have is from the Stomach down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and that they are ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ile; then next, that the Colon, where it joins the Straight Gut, lyes not <hi>rectum</hi> with the cavity of the Straight Gut, but cuts it at oblique angles; and upon the other hand all the force this impell'd liquor has, is only by the compreſſing the ſides of a Bladder, or a more valid propulſion by the Syringe; and therefore paſſing the ſmall reſiſtance from the motion of the Guts, there's firſt ſo much moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

loſt by raiſing the ſides of the Straight Gut, whereinto it may be propell'd without any other; but ſo ſoon as it comes to the joining of the Colon, it muſt reflect at every ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Gut, and the reflection too, is to be made upon a ſoft, tenſil body, which is more than enough to overcome a ten times greater force, than can be conceiv'd to be given to this liquor by the propulſion by the Syringe. And therefore, ſince the Straight Gut has no lacteals, and the Colon were ſuppoſed to have; yet his Clyſters not going any length there, could turn to no great account; at leaſt, not the twentieth part, very modeſtly ſpeaking, as the other way.</p>
               <p>But next, for the convenience of this Practice, I think 'tis the moſt inconvenient could have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd; for who can bear fifteen Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering days, and to take about twenty four Clyſters in that time; and then as many in caſe of a Relapſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is not only one of the moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom Practices, but the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive that can be by the Jeſuits Powder; for ſuppoſing an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary ſhould let us have them at

               <p>His Ulcers were dreſt, and he had the ſame Diet, and Medicins, with what elſe the place would afford, to that deſign: he was a little better, but having no proſpect of a perfect Cure was ſent aſhore, where he recover'd his former health.</p>
               <p>Theſe being all that had a true Scurvy, in the whole Summer I was in that Ship, I very willingly leave off this melancholy Practice of a diſeaſe, that's put out of our power to be cur'd at Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at Land too, is one of the moſt troubleſom, as every one, that knows its practice, unanimouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges.

                  <hi>K—B</hi>—of the—was troubled with a pain in his Yard, after an impure copulation; which very ſoon appear'd in a running, and that but very ſmall, at firſt; but encreas'd daily, and was of a green colour, he had an <hi>Chaude Piſſe, une chorde,</hi> and the erection was very painful.</p>
               <p>He complain'd of it to me when at Sea, and I cured him of the Gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaea, and its Appendices, in a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, without taking one grain of Mercury, Mercurial Preparations, Turpentine, Decoctions of Woods, Injections, and other Medicins, that are generally preſcribed with all the uncertainty imaginable. I could very willingly communicate this way of curing for publick uſe, if I might in honour; being no longer at my own liberty to diſpoſe of it, ſince I have communicated this method to a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Member of our College, in lieu of a practice he values very much. Yet without any breach of Faith, I aſſert, that the tedious, uncertain, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous practices in this diſeaſe, have
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40814:89"/>
proceeded from the miſunderſtanding Phyſicians are in about it; whereas if its <hi>place, force,</hi> and <hi>way</hi> of <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> were more ſenſible and obvious, we might ſoon diſcover more certain, genuine, and more natural ways of curing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thoſe be, even, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, beyond what any Man has hitherto thought of. But it not being convenient, upon this occaſion, to evince thoſe miſtakes too particularly, for this place; I will content my ſelf to prove, that the cauſe of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is not entertained in the <hi>Proſtatae, veſiculae ſeminales,</hi> or any ways further than the <hi>Yard</hi> it ſelf; without going too deep into the argument, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the Objections may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably made againſt its being there, thinking it the firſt part of knowledge not to be impoſed upon, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the putting things to rights; and tho we are not able to do <hi>this,</hi> and are ſure of the firſt, yet ought we fairly to confeſs our ignorance, that very ſubſtantial piece of Humanity, rather than to ſpeak things of which we have no thought, and a great deal leſs, to build our other reaſonings and practice upon ſo ſandy foundations:

Now that we may do the firſt, and diſcharge our thoughts of ſuch a cheat, let us call into our memory the Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarcoſes we daily ſee, and let us but compare this ſpungy fleſh, that thus fills up the paſſage of the Urine, with any thing elſe we find upon other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; and I'm ſure a Man that ſees like another, and has the ſenſe to compare, can find it not much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent (but eſpecially in its growing) from the like Excreſcencies that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, in curing wounds, ulcers, &amp;c. a certain Argument that there is a ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unity in the part, where thoſe Muſhrooms ſprout, which cannot be kept down and checkt like other fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous fleſh, and is ſeldom to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in the healthieſt people by a diſorderly practice. I know it may be ſaid, that there may be little ulcers bred in the <hi>Urethra,</hi> by the ſharpneſs of the matter that flows that way, from the affected parts, and they may make this falſe fleſh, tho theſe ulcers can never ſupply this running: but to drive this argument no great length, and not to outſhut a common ſight, I ſhall demonſtrate very plainly, that theſe ulcers are begun <hi>only</hi> in the <hi>Yard,</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:40814:91"/>
and afford this <hi>running</hi> from <hi>it;</hi> and at ſome other time make it plain, that this running comes not from above <hi>three inches</hi> within the Yard, and <hi>how</hi> that is done. For the preſent purpoſe let us remember, that our Anatomy teaches us, that there is a <hi>valve</hi> placed at that end of the <hi>Penis</hi> that's next the belly, that hinders the <hi>Regurgitation</hi> of the the Urine; and in the ſecond place that Runnings can be ſtopt by <hi>Injections,</hi> tho very often to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of the Patient. Now theſe <hi>Injections,</hi> at beſt, are as <hi>ſolid,</hi> if I may ſo ſay, as our <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> and this valve hindering the repaſſing of the Urine, we may conclude, that it hinders the paſſage of a body not more fluxil than the Urine: but ſince theſe Injections ſtop a plentiful running, and yet not going out of the Yard, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it is in the Penis they have their effects; and if ſo, then it's from the <hi>Penis</hi> this ſupply is made, which was to be demonſtrated, againſt the common Hypotheſis; and therefore it is no wonder, that Men are not able to better the Practice, from ſo unthinking Theories.</p>

I foreſee diſtinctly, the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences can be alledged againſt what I hint at, yet I ſhould think it an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable digreſſion to obviate them in this place, and do promiſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, even to a certainty, the ſeat and nature of this Diſeaſe, about which Phyſicians are as much in the dark, if not more, as about the time it was firſt known in the world.</p>

               <p>There are two things I would have obſerved in this diſeaſe; firſt, that the Medicins upon the paſt deſign be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver given till we be convinc'd that the obſtruction in the capillary arteries, of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40814:93"/>
the part thus affected, is not ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful; for when they are given before that time, as a great many Authors perſwade us, they only ſqueeze out the thinner part of the blood, and leave the reſt deſpoiled of a vehicle fit to maintain its fluxility, and ſo very convenient to heighten the obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which cauſes this inflammation and its conſequences: and therefore he muſt be ſure to blood plentifully, and the right way, before we think of giving internal Medicines.</p>
               <p>The other is, that we buſie not, nor amuſe our ſelves with the idle, and not only idle, but uſeleſs, and impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable diſtinction the Authors make in this diſeaſe; when they tell us, that ſince 'tis an inflammation about the Throat, if that be of the internal muſcles of the <hi>Larynx</hi> it muſt be call'd a <hi>Cynanche;</hi> but if of the external muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, a <hi>Paracynanche:</hi> and if on the internal muſcles of the <hi>Pharynx,</hi> a <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanche;</hi> if on the external muſcles of that part a <hi>Paracynanche.</hi> And that this diſtinction is impracticable, is evident to any one that knows the Anatomy of theſe parts; how ſmall
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40814:94"/>
the proper muſcles of the <hi>Larynx</hi> are, and how near the internal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal muſcles are one to another; and they only divided and parted by a thin membrane, which cannot only not hinder the inflam'd muſcles of the one ſort to preſs hard upon the other, but is even itſelf affected with this Inflammation. But they ſhould have told us too, the ſymptoms of This part's being affected, and ſuch ſigns whereby we may diſtinguiſh the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the one ſort of theſe muſcles from <hi>That</hi> of the other: but of this too much.</p>
               <p>Thus I have run over, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different exactneſs, my Diſquiſition into the marine diſeaſes, and the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of thoſe in the Fleet laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; which, I preſume, may correct a great many errors and miſtakes in that affair, and highly contribute to an amendment of others, of the ſame nature: and cannot doubt, but that the Candor of the ingenious will very eaſily cover any pieces of Frailty I may have committed in this firſt Eſſay; and for that favour, I ſhall endeavour to better it, if I find en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40814:94"/>
ſuitable to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. Yet, all theſe things will better appear, in the Hiſtories of the next years ſervice, that are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with this.</p>
