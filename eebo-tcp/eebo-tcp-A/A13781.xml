            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough it passe as a generall
prouerbe, that trauailers may tel leasings
by authoritie: yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no way daunted by that bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare-thunderbolt,
but confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
standing on the iustice of my
cause, my kinde commendations
to all you my deare friendes first
remembred, thus from <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
I beginne to salute you. You
shal vnderstand, that since my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from the <hi>Grand Cayro</hi> towards the Holy land, I wrot
you a letter from <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> wherein I certified you of all
my proceedings from <hi>Grand Cayro,</hi> euen to that very place. I
sent it with seauen other Letters beside to <hi>Damasco</hi> in a Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uan,
and thence to be conueyed to <hi>Constantinople:</hi> but doubting
least the said packet be not as yet come to your hands, I thought
it good to write againe vnto you, concerning all the aforesaide
proceedings, as also the rest of my voyage to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> with
my imprisonment and troubles in the citie, as also what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
antiquities I sawe there and elsewhere, vntill my
returne backe to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which was the 11. of Aprill 1601.
First then let me tell you, that I departed not from the <hi>Grand
Cayro</hi> till the 9. of March: vpon which day I came to the place,
where (it is saide) the Uirgine <hi>Mary</hi> did stay with our Sauiour
Christ. So farre was I accompanied with <hi>Antonie Thorpe,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:19852:3"/>
and some others that came vp to the <hi>Grand Cayro</hi> with mee:
but here they left mee, departing back to the citie, and I with
my fellow trauailer Master <hi>Iohn Burrell,</hi> both of vs being in our
Pilgrimes habit, came y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> night to a towne called <hi>Canko,</hi> where
we were glad to take vp our lodging in a yarde, hauing no other
bedding then the bare ground. The next day we departed thence,
and came to a towne in the Land of <hi>Gozan,</hi> where we met with
a companie of Turkes, Iewes, and Christians, and some sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
hundred and fiftie Camelles, all which were bound for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masco</hi>
ouer the deserts: yet was there amongst them two and
twentie Greekes and Armenians, whose purposed trauaile lay
to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which made vs the gladder of their companie. At
this towne, being named <hi>Philbits,</hi> we stayed two daies and one
night: in which time I went into a house, where I sawe (in my
iudgement) a very strange secret of hatching Chickins, by arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
heat or warmthe: the like I had seene before at the
<hi>Grand Cayro,</hi> but not in such extraordinary numbers or mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
as heere, the manner whereof (for your better satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
was as followeth.</p>
            <p>The country people inhabiting about this towne, by foure
or fiue miles distance euery waie, doe bring their Egges in apt
cartage for the purpose, vpon Asses or Camelles to this place,
where there is an Ouen or Furnace purposely kept temperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
warme, and the Furner or Master thereof (or howsoeuer it
shall please you to tearme him) standeth ready at a little doore,
receiuing the Egges of euery one, by tale: except when the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ariseth so high, as to tenne Camelles lading or more, then
he filleth a measure by tale, &amp; after that order measures all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> rest.
And let me tell you this for a trueth, that I sawe there receiued
by the Furner, Cooke, or Baker, in one day, what by tale &amp;
what by measure, to the number of thirtie fiue or fortie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Egges: and they tolde me, that, for three daies space
together, hee doth nothing but receiue in still, and at
twelue daies they come againe to fetch Chickins, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
at tenne daies, and sometimes (but not very often)
at seauen daies, according as the weather falleth out. Perhaps
some two hundred persons are owners of one Raungefull, some
hauing two thousand, some one, or more or lesse, as the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
amount too: but the Furner noateth the names and porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19852:3"/>
of euery bringer, and if he hap to haue an hundred and fiftie
thousand, or two hundred thousand at one heate (as many times
it chaunceth that he hath) yet doth he mingle them altogether,
as not respecting to whom they seuerally belong. Then doth
he lay them one by one vpon his Raunge, so neere as they can
lye and touch each other, hauing first made a bed for them of
Camelles dunge burnt: and the place, whereon the ashes doth
rest, is of a very thinne matter made of earth, but mixed with
the Camels dung in the making, and some Pigeons dung is
also amongst it: yet herein consisteth not the secreat onely, for
there is made a concaue or hollow place about three foote
breadth vnder it, whereon is likewise spred an other layer of
Camels dung, and vnder that is the place where the fire is
made. Yet can I not rightly call it fire, because it appeareth
too be nothing but embers: for I could discerne it but as quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
ashes, yeelding a temperate heate to the next concaue, and
the heate being resisted by the layer of dung next it, (which
dung being greene, and layd vpon pieces of withered trees, or
rather boughes of old dead trees) deliuereth foorth an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
vapour, and that vapour entreth the hollow concaue
next vnder the Egges, where in time it pearceth the before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
mixed earth, which toucheth the ashes whereon the Egges
are laid, and so serueth as a necessarie receptacle for al the heate
comming from vnderneath. This artificiall heate gliding
through the embers whereon the Egges lie, doth by degrees
warme thorowe the shelles, and so infuseth life by the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
of heate: thus in seuen, eight, nine, ten, or sometimes
twelue daies, life continueth by this artificiall meanes. Now
when the Furner perceiueth life to appeare, and that the shelles
begin to breake, then he beginneth to gather them: but of an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand, he hardly gathereth threescore thousand, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
but fiftie thousand, and sometime (when the day is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast)
not twentie thousand: and if there chaunce any lightning,
thunder or raine, then of a thousand he gathers not one, for they
doo then all miscarie &amp; die. And this is to be remembred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
that be the weather neuer so fayre, the aire perfect cleare,
and euery thing as themselues can desire, let the Chickens be
hatched in the best manner that may be: yet haue they either a
clawe too much or too little: for sometimes they haue fiue clawes,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19852:4"/>
sometimes sixe, some but two before, and one behind, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
very fewe or any in their right shape. Afterward, when
the people come to receiue, that before had brought in, the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
giues to euery one ratably, according as the Furnace yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
reseruing to himselfe the tenth for his labour. Thus haue
you the secret of hatching Chickens by heate artificiall, at the
towne of <hi>Philbits</hi> in the land of <hi>Gozan,</hi> which I thinke were
in vaine to be practised in England, because the ayre there is
hardly ten daies together clarified: neither is there any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels
dunge, though they haue dunge of other beasts euery way
as hote: therefore when the Sunne is in <hi>Cancer, Leo,</hi> or <hi>Virgo,</hi>
you may (if you please) trie what can be done. Pexhaps some
will thinke this to be a lie or fable, but to such I answere, I
can vrge their credenceno furder then my faith and truth may
perswade them: and if thereon they will not beleeue me, let
them take paines to make their owne eies a witnesse, and when
they haue paid as dearely as I haue doone, (for the sight of this
and other things cost me an hundred Markes in fiftie daies)
their iudgement will be better confirmed.</p>
            <p>But now to my iourney toward the desert of <hi>Arabia,</hi> which I
must passe before I can come to the Holy land. The 13. of
Marche we departed from the towne of <hi>Philbits,</hi> trauailing all
night in companie with the <hi>Carauan</hi> of <hi>Damasco,</hi> and the 14. at
nine of the clocke, we pitched our tents at <hi>Boharo</hi> in the land of
<hi>Gozan.</hi> From thence wee departed that night, and the 15. at
night we pitched at <hi>Salhia,</hi> which is to the Eastward of the
land of <hi>Gozan,</hi> and stands on the borders of the <hi>Arabian</hi> deserts.
Here we staied two daies for feare of the wild <hi>Arabes,</hi> and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thence the 17. we passed that night ouer a great bridge, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which the salt water standeth. This water comes out of the
Sea from the partes of <hi>Damieta,</hi> and by mens hands was cut
out of that place, some hundred and fiftie miles into the maine
land, by <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> king of Egypt, who purposed to bring the
Red-sea, and the Mediterranean all into one: but when he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw,
that if he had gone through with this worke, all his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
had bin quite drowned, he gaue it ouer, &amp; builded a bridge
ouer for passage. This place parteth <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and no
sooner had we past this bridge, but we were set vpon by the wild
<hi>Arabes:</hi> and notwithstanding our great companie (for we were
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19852:4"/>
more then a thousand persons) a Camell laden with Calicoes
was taken from vs, foure of our men hurt, and one of them mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
wounded: so away ran the <hi>Arabes</hi> with the preye, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnable to helpe it, because it was night.</p>
            <p>The 18. in the morning, we pitched by a well of brackish wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
but I forgot to tell you, that my fellow Pilgrime M. <hi>Iohn
Burrell</hi> escaped very narrowly in the last nights bickering. Here
we rested our selues till three of the clocke in the afternoone,
call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d <hi>Lasara;</hi> for the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> diuide the day but
into foure partes: then we departed, and pitched the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at a Castell in the deserts called <hi>Catga.</hi> This is one of the
three castels which the Turkes kept in the deserts, to defend al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trauailers
from the wild <hi>Arabes:</hi> wherefore here we pay a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
tare, <hi>vz.</hi> 60. pieces of siluer of two pence a piece value,
for each man or boy, and 76. pieces for a Camell laden, and 14.
for a Mule. Hauing paid this imposition, we departed, and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
againe the 19. at another brackish well, from whence set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
onward, we pitched the 20. of March at the second Castell
called <hi>Arris,</hi> kept also by the Turkes in the said deserts, where
our taxe was but 20. pieces of siluer for each passenger, and 30.
for a Camell. From thence we were guided by many Soldiors
to the third Castell called <hi>Raphaell,</hi> making one long iourney
of 24. houres together. Here it is said that the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi>
and <hi>Iudea</hi> fought many great battailes: which to me seemed
very vnlikely, because there is nothing to releeue an armie
withall, except sand and salt water. There wee paid but ten
pieces each passenger, and 20. for a beast: so departing thence,
the 22. in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning, wee pitched at <hi>Gaza</hi> in <hi>Palestine,</hi> a goodly
fruitfull countrey, and here we were quitted of all the deserts.
In this towne I sawe the place, where (as they told vs) <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
puld downe the two Pillers, and slewe the <hi>Philistines:</hi> and
surely it appeares to be the same towne, by reason of the scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the countrey: here we paied 22. pieces for each beast, and
10. each passenger.</p>
            <p>Hence we departed the 22. of March, and pitched at a place
called in <hi>Arabian, Canuie,</hi> but by the Christians termed <hi>Bershe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi>
being vpon the borders of <hi>Iudea:</hi> where we paid but 2. pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of siluer each one, and 4. for a beast. Departing hence, the
23. in the morning, we pitched our Tents vpon a Greene, close
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19852:5"/>
vnder the walles of <hi>Ramoth</hi> in <hi>Gilead:</hi> there I stayed all that
day, and wrote eight Letters for Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the forenamed <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauan,</hi>
which went for <hi>Damasco,</hi> to be conueyed to <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
and so for England.</p>
            <p>The next day being the 24. in the morning, I with the other
Christians set towards <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the great <hi>Carauan</hi> went
their way for <hi>Damasco:</hi> but wee pitched short that night at a
place called in <hi>Arabian Cudeche laneb,</hi> being 16. miles from
<hi>Hebron,</hi> where the Sepulchre of our forefather <hi>Abraham</hi> is, and
fiue little miles from <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> From thence we departed in
the morning, being our Lady day in Lent, and at 9. of the clocke
before noone, I sawe the cittie of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> when kneeling
downe, and saying the Lords prayer, I gaue God most hartie
thankes for conducting mee thither, to behold so holy a place
with mine eies, wherof I had read so often before. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a furlong of the gates, I with my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion M. <hi>Iohn Burrell,</hi>
went singing and praising God, till we came to the west gate of
the Cittie, and there we staied, because it is not lawfull for a
Christian to enter vnadmitted. My companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aduised me to say
I was a Greeke, onely to auoid going to Masse: but I not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the Greeke tongue, refused so to doo, telling him euen at
the gates entraunce, that I would neither denie my Countrie
nor Religion: whereupon being demaunded who wee were,
M. <hi>Burrell</hi> (answering in the Greeke tongue) told them that he
was a Greeke, and I an Englishman. This gaue him admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to the Greeke Patriarke, but I was seazed on and cast in
prison, before I had staied a ful houre at the gate: for the Turkes
flatly denied, that they had euer heard either of my Queene or
Countrey, or that she paied them any tribute. The <hi>Peter Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi>
who is there defender of all Christian Pilgrimes (and the
principall procurer of mine imprisonment, because I did not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
my selfe vnder his protection, but confidently stood to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
protected vnder the Turke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope) made the Turke
so much mine enemie, that I was reputed to be a spie, and so
(by no meanes) could I get release from the dungeon.</p>
            <p>Now giue me fauour to tell you, how it pleased hope (that
very day) to deliuer mee, and graunt my passe as a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
without yeelding to any other ceremonie, then cariage of
a waxe candle only, farre beyond mine owne best hope or expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19852:5"/>
Here let me remember you, how I was stayed at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth</hi>
in <hi>Gilead,</hi> where I wrote the eight Letters for Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by
the <hi>Carauan</hi> of <hi>Damasco:</hi> hauing so good leysure, I went to a
Fountaine to washe my fowle linnen, and being earnest about
my businesse, there suddenly came a Moore vnto me, who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
my clothes out of my hands, and calling me by my name,
said he would help me. You doubt not but this was some amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to mee, to heare such a man call me by my name, and in
place so farre distant from my freends, countrie and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
which he perceiuing, boldly thus spake in the Franke
tongue. Why Captaine, I hope you haue not forgotten me,
for it is not yet fortie dayes, since you set me a land at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
with the rest of those passengers you brought from <hi>Argier,</hi>
in your ship called the <hi>Troyan:</hi> and here is another in this <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauan,</hi>
whom you likewise brought in companie with you, and
would not be a little glad to see you. I demaunded of him if he
dwelt there: he answered me no, but both he and his fellow
were going in the <hi>Carauan</hi> to <hi>Damasco,</hi> which place they call
<hi>Sham,</hi> and thence to <hi>Beggdatt,</hi> which we call <hi>Babylon,</hi> thence to
<hi>Mecha</hi> to make a <hi>Hadgee,</hi> for so they are called when they haue
bin at <hi>Mecha:</hi> moreouer, he told me that he dwelt in the Cittie
of <hi>Fesse</hi> in <hi>Barbarie.</hi> This man (in my mind) God sent to be the
meanes of mine immediate deliuerie. For after I had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good
notice of him, I well remembred that I saw him in my ship;
though one man among 300. is not very readily knowne: for
so many brought I from <hi>Argier</hi> into those partes of different
Nations, as Turkes, Moores, Iewes and Christians. I desired
this man to bring me to the sight of his other companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which
(hauing washed my linnen) he did, &amp; him I knew very readily.
These two concluded, that the one of them would depart thence
with the Carauan, and the other goe along with me to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
which was the Moore before reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred: &amp; such kind care had
the Infidel of me, as he would not leaue me vnaccompanied in
this strange Land, which I cannot but impute to Gods especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
prouidence, for my deliuerance out of prison, else had I bin
left in most miserable case. When this Moore sawe mee thus
imprisoned in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> my dungeon being right against the
Sepulcher of Christ, albeit he wept, yet he had me be of good
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19852:6"/>
comfort. Away went he to the <hi>Bashawe</hi> of the citie, and to the
<hi>Saniack,</hi> before whome he tooke his oath, that I was a Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a Shippe, which had brought 250. or 300. Turkes and
Moores into <hi>Egypt</hi> from <hi>Argier</hi> and <hi>Tunis,</hi> their iourney being
vnto <hi>Mecha.</hi> This Moore (in regard he was a Muzzle-man) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
so wel with them, that returning with sixe Turkes back
to the prison, he called me to the doore, and there saide vnto me:
that if I would goe to the house of the <hi>Pater Guardian,</hi> and yeeld
my selfe vnder his protection, I should be enforced to no religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but mine owne, except it were to carie a candle, to the which
I willingly condescended. So paying the charges of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
I was presently deliuered, and brought to the <hi>Guardians</hi>
Monastery: where the <hi>Pater</hi> comming to me, tooke mee by the
hand and bad me welcome, maruailing I would so much erre
from Christianitie, as to put my selfe rather vnder the Turkes
then his protection. I told him, what I did, was because I
would not goe to Masse, but keepe my conscience to my selfe.
He replyed, that many Englishmen had beene there, but (being
Catholiques) went to Masse, telling the Turks at the Gates
entrance, that they were Frenchmen, for the Turkes knowe
not what you meane by the worde Englishman: aduising me
further, that when any of my Countreymen vndertooke the like
trauaile, at the gates of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> they should tearm themselues
either Frenchmen or Fritons, because they are well knowne
to the Turkes. This or such like conference past betweene vs:
also how old our Queenes Maiestie was, and what was the
reason she gaue nothing to the maintenance of the Holy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher,
as well as other Christian Kings and Princes did?
with diuers other triuial questions, whereto I answered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
The day being spent euen to twi-light, master <hi>Iohn
Burrel,</hi> who passed for a Greeke without any trouble, came in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, being neuerthelesse constrained to this Monasterie, or else
he might not stay in the citie: for such sway doe the Papistes
cary there, that no Christian stranger can haue admittance
there, but he must be protected vnder them, or not enter the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Master <hi>Burrell</hi> and I being together in the Court of the
Monastery, twelue fat-fed Fryers came foorth vnto vs, each of
them carying a waxe candle burning, and two spare-candles
beside, the one for master <hi>Burrel,</hi> the other for me. Another Frier
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19852:6"/>
brought a great Bason of warme water, mingled with Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and other sweete flowers, and a Carpet being spread on the
ground, and Cushions in Chaires set orderly for vs: the <hi>Pater
Guardian</hi> came and set vs downe, giuing each of vs a Candle in
our hands, then came a Frayer and puld off our hose, and (set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Bason on the Carpet) washed our feete. So soone as
the Fryer began to wash, the twelue Fryers began to sing, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
so till our feete were washed: which being done, they
went along singing, &amp; we with the <hi>Guardian</hi> came to a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
in the Monastery, where one of them began an Oration in
forme of a Sermon, tending to this effect: how meritorious it
was for vs to visit the Holy land, &amp; see those sanctified places
where our Sauiours feete had trode. The Sermon being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they brought vs to a chamber where our supper was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
there we fed somwhat fearefully, in regard y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> strange cates
haue as strange qualities: but committing our selues to God, &amp;
their outward-appearing Christian kindnesse, we fell to harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
supt very bountifully, &amp; afterward (praysing God) were lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
decently. Thus much for my first daies entertainement in
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was the 25. day of March 1601. being our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
day in Lent. Now followes what the Fryers afterward
shewed mee, being thereto appointed by the <hi>Pater Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Earely the next morning we arose, and hauing saluted the <hi>Pater
Guardian,</hi> he appointed vs seauen Friers and a Trouchman:
so foorth we went to see all the holy places in the citie which
were to be seene, except those in <hi>Sepulchra sancta,</hi> for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a whole daies work afterward, and at euery place where
we came, we kneeled downe, and saide the Lords prayer.</p>
            <p>The first place of note that the Fryers shewed vs, was the
place iudiciall: next, the house of <hi>Veronica sancta:</hi> and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of them what Saint that was, they told me it was shee
that did wipe our Sauiours face, as he passed by in his agonie.
Descending a little lower in the same street, they shewed mee
the way which our Sauiour went to crucifying, called by them
<hi>Via dolorosa.</hi> Then on the right hand in the same street, I was
showne the house of the rich glutton, at whose gate poore des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised
<hi>Lazarus</hi> lay. Holding on our way downe this streete, wee
came to a turning passage on the left hand: whence they tolde
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19852:7"/>
me <hi>Simon Sirenus</hi> was comming toward the <hi>Dolorous way,</hi> when
the Soldiours seeing him, called him, and compeld him against
his will to helpe our Sauiour to carie his crosse. Then they told
mee, that in the same place the people wept, when Christ an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
said vnto them: <hi>Oh daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> weepe not
for mee. &amp;c.</hi> Next, they shewed me the Church, where the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<hi>Marie</hi> fell into an agonie, when Christ passed by, carying
his Crosse. Afterward they brought mee to <hi>Pilates</hi> Palace,
which though it be all ruinated, yet is there an olde Arche of
stone, which is still maintained by the Christians, and it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
full in the high way, wee passed vnder it: much like the
way of passage vnder master <hi>Hammons</hi> house in the Bulwarke,
but that the Arch is higher: for vpon that Arche is a Gallerie,
which admitteth passage (ouer our heads) from one side of the
streete to the other: for <hi>Pilates</hi> Palace extended ouer the high
way on both sides, and <hi>Pilate</hi> had two greate windowes in the
saide Gallerie, to gaze out both waies into the streete, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Hammon</hi> hath the like aduantage at both his windowes.
Into this Gallery was our Sauiour brought, when hee was
showen vnto the Iewes, and they standing belowe in the street,
heard the words of <hi>Ecce homo.</hi> A little from this place, is the
foote of the staires, where our Sauiour did first take vp his
Crosse. Then they brought mee to the place, where the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<hi>Marie</hi> was conceiued and borne, which is the Church of
Saint <hi>Anna,</hi> and no Turkish Church. Next, they shewed me
the Poole, where Christ cleansed the Leapers, and then gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
mee to Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> gate, a little without it vpon the
left hand, they shewed mee the stone wheron S. <hi>Stephen</hi> was
stoned. From hence I sawe the staires going vp to porte <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi>
at which porte are diuers reliques to be seen: it was the East
gate of the Temple, which <hi>Salomon</hi> built vpon mount <hi>Moria,</hi> in
which Temple was the place of <hi>Sanctum Sancterum:</hi> but now
in that place is builded a goodly greate Church, belonging to
the Turkes. Thus spent I the second day, being the 26. of
March, all within the gates of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> except my going to
see the stone wherewith S. <hi>Stephen</hi> was stoned.</p>
            <p>The next day, being the 27. of March, hauing done our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to God and the <hi>Pater Guardian,</hi> we hyred Asses for the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and the Trouchman to ride on, and going foorth the citie
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19852:7"/>
gates, we mounted and rode directly toward <hi>Bythinea.</hi> By the
way as we rode, they shewed me the place of the fruitlesse Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,
which Christ cursed: next, the Castle of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that
<hi>Lazarus</hi> whome Christ loued so well: for his house or Castle is
in <hi>Bythinea,</hi> but it is vtterly ruinated, and nothing to be seene
but the two sides of a wall. In the same towne, they shewed
me the house of <hi>Marie Magdalen,</hi> but al so ruinated, that nothing
is left of it but a piece of a wall: there I sawe likewise <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaes</hi>
house, consisting of three pieces of a wall: and thence they
brought me to the stone, where the two sisters tolde Christ that
<hi>Lazarus</hi> was deade: from whence passing on, they shewed me
the place where our Sauiour raised <hi>Lazarus</hi> from death, after
he had lien three daies in the ground, and where he was buried
afterward when he died. This place hath bin not ably kept from
the beginning, and is repaired still by the Christians, but yet in
poore and very bare sort, and this is all that I saw in <hi>Bythinia.</hi>
Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence we rode vnto Mount <hi>Oliuet,</hi> &amp; passing by <hi>Bethphage,</hi>
they brought me to the place, where our Sauiour tooke the Asse
and Colte, when he rode to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> vpon Palme Sunday.
Riding from <hi>Bethphage</hi> directly to the North, wee came to the
foote of Mount <hi>Oliuet,</hi> where they shewed me the place <hi>Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta</hi>
of the virgin <hi>Maries</hi> Annunciation, and ascending to the top
of the Mount wee saw the place of our Sauiours Ascension: at
the sight whereof we said our Prayers, and were commaunded
withal to say 5. <hi>Pater nosters,</hi> and 5. <hi>Aue Maries:</hi> but we said the
Lords praier, tooke notice of the place and departed. This is the
very highest parte of Mount <hi>Oliuet,</hi> and hence may be discerned
many notable places: as first West from it is the prospect of the
new Cittie of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> Southwest from it may be seene the
prospect of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> which is adioyning to new <hi>Ierusalem:</hi>
also in the valley betweene <hi>Sion</hi> and the mount whereon I
stood, I sawe the brooke <hi>Cedron,</hi> the Poole <hi>Silo,</hi> the Garden
wherein our Sauiour praied, the place where afterward he was
betrayed, and diuers other notable things in this valley of
<hi>Gethsemanie:</hi> as the Tombe of <hi>Absolon,</hi> king <hi>Dauids</hi> sonne, the
Tombe of <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> and others which I will speake of as I
come to them. Full South fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mount <hi>Oliuet,</hi> I could see the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
we came last from, as all <hi>Bythinia</hi> and <hi>Bethphage:</hi> also East
North-east from this mount, may be scene both the riuer of <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:19852:8"/>
which is some 15. miles off, and <hi>Iericho,</hi> which is not so
farre, because it is to the Westward of <hi>Iordan.</hi> From mount
<hi>Oliuet</hi> East and East-South-east, may be seene the lake of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> which is some 100. miles long, &amp; 8. miles
ouer: all these places I set with the Compasse when I was on
mount <hi>Oliuet,</hi> for I staied on the top of it some two houres and
a halfe, hauing a little Compasse about me. Descending hence
toward the foote Westward, wee came to a place where the
Friers told me, that a woman called <hi>S. Pelagia</hi> did penaunce in
the habit of a Frier: whereat I smiling, they demaunded why
I did so? I answered, that to beleeue <hi>Pelagia</hi> was a Saint,
stood out of the compasse of my <hi>Creede:</hi> they tolde me, when I
should come home at night, they would shew me sufficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
for it: but when I came home I had so much to doo, in
writing my notes out of my table bookes, that I had no leysure
to vrge their Authours for <hi>S. Pelagia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time they brought vs to the place, where our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
did foresee the iudgement, then where he made the <hi>Pater
noster,</hi> and then where the Apostles made the <hi>Creede.</hi> From
hence wee came to the place where Christ wept for <hi>Ierusalem:</hi>
thence, to the place where the virgin <hi>Marie</hi> gaue the gyrdle to
<hi>S. Thomas:</hi> and then to the place where she prated for <hi>S. Stephen:</hi>
all these last were comming downe mount <hi>Oliuet,</hi> towards
the valley of <hi>Gethseminie,</hi> where by the way we came to our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Church, wherein is her Sepulcher, and the Sepulcher of
her husband <hi>Ioseph,</hi> with the Sepulcher of <hi>Anna,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in that Church. This Church standeth at the foote of
Mount <hi>Oliuet,</hi> and was built (as they say) by <hi>Helena</hi> the mother
of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great: here the Friers went into the virgin
<hi>Maries</hi> sepulcher, &amp; there either said Masse, or Praiers, while we
in meane time went to dinner. In this Church is a fountaine of
exceeding fine water, &amp; in regard we went downe into a vault
as it were, it giueth a meruailous loude <hi>Eccho</hi> or sound. Hence
went we to the Caue, whether <hi>Iudas</hi> came to betray Christ whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he was at prayer, and thence to the Garden where our Sauiour
left his Disciples, commaunding them to watch and praie;
but found them sleeping at his returne: then they brought me
to the Garden where Christ was taken, and all these last three
were in the valley of <hi>Gethsemanie.</hi> Riding vnto the towne
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19852:8"/>
whereof the valley beares name) on the left hand I saw the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
remembred Sepulchers of <hi>Absolon</hi> and <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> and
on the right hand, the brooke <hi>Cedron,</hi> which at my being there
had not one drop of water in it: for (indeed) it is but a ditche
to conuay the water from the two hilles (I meane Mount <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet,</hi>
and mount <hi>Sion</hi>) when any store of raine falleth, and this
ditche or brooke <hi>Cedron</hi> is in the valley betweene both those
hilles. Hard by the brooke <hi>Cedron,</hi> they shewed me a stone
marked with the feete and elbowes of Christ, in their throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him downe when as they tooke him, and euer since (say
they) haue those prints remained there. From hence wee rode
to the place, where <hi>S. Iames</hi> the younger did hide himselfe, and
afterward was buried there: there also they shewed where <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah</hi>
the sonne of <hi>Barachiah</hi> was buried, and brought me to
another place, where (they say) the virgin <hi>Marie</hi> vsed often to
pray. Then came we to the Poole of <hi>Silo,</hi> wherein <hi>M. Burrell</hi>
and I washed our selues, and hence wee were shewen the place
where the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> was sawne in pieces: thence they
guided vs to an exceeding deepe Well, where the Iewes (as
they say) hid the holy fire in the time of <hi>Nabuchodonozor.</hi> Here
we ascended from the valley to a hill side, which lieth iust South
from mount <hi>Sion:</hi> but there is a great valley betweene, called
<hi>Gehemion,</hi> and there they shewed me the place where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
hid themselues, being a Caue in a rocke. Ascending higher
hence, they brought me to the field, or rather to be more right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tearmed the Rocke, where the common buriall place is for
straungers, being the very same (as they say) which was bought
with the thirtie pieces of siluer, that <hi>Iudas</hi> receiued as the price
of his Maister, which place is called <hi>Aceldoma,</hi> and is fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as followeth. It hath three holes aboue, &amp; on the side there
is a vent: at the vpper holes they vse to let downe the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to the estimation of some 50. foote downe. In this place
I saw two bodies, new or very lately let downe, and looking
downe (for by reason of the three great holes aboue, where the
dead bodies lye, it is very light) I receiued such a sauour vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my heade, as it made me very sicke, so that I was glad to
entreat the Friers to goe no further, but to returne home to the
citie. So here we went through the vallie of <hi>Gehemion,</hi> and at
the foote of mount <hi>Sion</hi> (hauing a little bottle of water which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19852:9"/>
I brought from the Poole <hi>Silo</hi>) I branke, and rested there an
houres space, eating a fewe Raisins and Oliues, which wee
brought with vs from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in the morning. After I had
well rested and refreshed my selfe, we began to ascend mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and a little way vp the hill, they shewed me the place, where
<hi>Peter</hi> hauing denyed Christ, and hearing the Cock crowe, went
out and wept. Ascending higher, they shewed mee the house
where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> virgine <hi>Marie</hi> dwelt, which was near vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Temple:
then they brought me to the place, where the Iewes setting on
the blessed virgine to take her, she was conuayed away by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.
Hence we went to the house of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> which was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
higher vpon mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and there I sawe the prison
wherein our Sauiour was detained. Passing on still higher,
they guided mee to a little Chappell which is kept by the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,</hi>
whereinto entring, at the high Altar they shewed me
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> stone which was vpon our Sauiours Sepulcher (as they say)
and it is neer to the place where <hi>Peter</hi> denyed Christ, for there
they shewed me the Piller, whereon the Cocke stood when hee
crowed. Hence was I brought to the place where our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
made his last Supper, and thence I came where the holy
Ghost descended vpon the Apostles: whence passing on, they
shewed me the place where Christ appeared to his Disciples, the
eight day after his Resurrection, when <hi>S. Thomas</hi> desired to see
his woundes. Neere to this place vpon mount <hi>Sion,</hi> the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Marie</hi> died, and hard by they shewed me a place bought by
the Pope of the Turkes, for buriall of the <hi>Europian</hi> Christians,
because he would not haue them cast into <hi>Aceldama:</hi> they tolde
vs that the yeare before, fiue Englishmen were buried in that
place, whether by the Friers poisoning them, or howsoeuer else
it happened, but we thought it straunge, that all fiue should die
together in one weeke. Thence came we to the house of <hi>Annas</hi>
the high Priest, which is now but a paire of very old walles,
&amp; nothing else of it to be seene: but at the side of one of the walles,
is an old Oliue tree, whereto they told me that our Sauiour
was fast bound: and demaunding a further reason thereof, they
said, that when he was brought vnto this house, <hi>Annas</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe,
his people would not awake him: so during their time of
stay, they bound him to the said Oliue tree, and when he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked,
then he was brought in and examined.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:19852:9"/>
Departing hence toward the Southgate of the citie, which
standeth likewise vpon mount <hi>Sion,</hi> wee alighted from our
Asses: and entring, I noated it well, for now I had seene
three of the foure gates. And being desirous to see the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
also, they brought me to the Church of <hi>S. Thomas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which
is within the wall all ruinated: then to the Churche of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.
Marke,</hi> whether <hi>Peter</hi> came, being deliuered out of prison by
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Angell that brake open the gate. Then they shewed me the
house of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> whence wee came to a place kept by the
<hi>Abashenes,</hi> &amp; there ascending first by a darke way, ledde on by
a line or corde, wee attained to a high place neere to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchra
sancta,</hi> where I paid two pieces of siluer to goe in, and
being entred, I demaunded what place it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the same
(quoth they) where <hi>Abraham</hi> would haue sacrificed his senne
<hi>Isaac.</hi> Thence went wee to the prison wherein <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and
<hi>S. Iohn</hi> were, being the next doore to the prison wherin I was
put before: which made me the sorier, that it was not my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to haue gone into it, being so neere it. Hence we came
to the North-gate, being on mount <hi>Caluarie</hi> side, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
well viewed the gate, and perceiuing it waxed late, we
went directly home: this was my third daies worke in and
about <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> wearied not a little with often alighting to
pray: for at each seuerall place before recounted, we dismoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and said the Lords praier on our knees.</p>
            <p>On the morrow, being the 28. early in the morning wee
tooke our Asses, riding forth at the Westgate, through which
I first entred, and passing on to the Southward, we left mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<hi>Sion</hi> on the left hand: at the foote whereof they shewed me the
house of <hi>Vriah,</hi> and the Fountaine where <hi>Bersaba</hi> washed her
selfe, when king <hi>Dauid</hi> espied her out of his Turret. Thence
went we to the place, where the Angell tooke vp <hi>Abacuck</hi> by
the hayre of the head, to carie meate to <hi>Daniell</hi> in the Lions
denne. Next came we to the place, where the wise men found
the Starre when it was lost, and then where the virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
rested her selfe vnder a tree, as shee came from <hi>Bethlem</hi> to
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which tree they still repaice, by setting another
close to the roote of it. Hence roade wee to the house of <hi>Elias</hi>
the Prophet, where they shewed me his vsuall place of slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping:
and this house standeth so vpon a hill, as from thence
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19852:10"/>
I did see <hi>Bethlem</hi> a farre off. Thence went we to an old rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
house, which they told me was <hi>Iacobs:</hi> which may the
better appeare to be so, for in the field thereto adioining, is
the Tombe of <hi>Rachell Iacobs</hi> wife: and some two miles from
this Tombe, is a towne in the same field called <hi>Bethesula,</hi> the
inhabitants whereof are all Christians. In this great field
(being betweene <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Bethlem</hi>) did lie the Campe
of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> when hee besieged <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> From hence
we rode to the field, where the Angels brought tidings of
great ioy to the Shepheards, which is two miles from <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi>
and thence we rode to <hi>Bethlem</hi> to the Monastery, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
are some 10. Friers: who welcomed me very kindly, and
brought me first into a great Church, then into a large en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
wherein I sawe the name of M. <hi>Hugo Stapers</hi> twise set
one aboue another, and betweene them both I set my name.
Then they guided mee downe the staiers into a vault, where
was a Chappell set in the place of our Sauiours Natiuitie,
enclosing both it, and the maunger wherein Christ was laid,
and also the place where he was presented with gifts by the
Wise men. Ouer this Chappell is a great Church, built by
Q. <hi>Helena</hi> mother to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great (as they say) and
further in I sawe diuers Tombes of holy men and others.
Going vp to the top of the Church, I saw vpon the leads the
name of <hi>M. Hugo Stapers</hi> againe ingranen, which made mee
looke the earnestlier for some other Englishmens names: but
finding none, I carued downe my name and came away the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
went we in and dined with the Friers. After dinner, they
brought me to the place where the virgin <hi>Marie</hi> hid her selfe,
when search was made to kill the children. So taking my
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aue of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> giuing the Friers three pieces of gold, for
my dinner and my companie with me, being 8. in number:
mounting on our Asses, wee rode to the Well, where King
<hi>Dauids</hi> three Captaines fetched water for him, through the
whole hoste of the <hi>Philistines:</hi> which Well standeth a little
way from <hi>Bethlem,</hi> towards <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and hath three places
to draw water vp at. Hence went we presently backe to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
entring the gate at foure of the clocke in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone,
and at 5. the Turkes let vs in to the <hi>Sepulchra sancta,</hi>
each of vs paying 9. pieces of gold for our entraunce. No soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19852:10"/>
were we in, but they locked the gates, so there I said till
11. of the clocke the next day, and then came we foorth: now
followes what I sawe in <hi>Sepulchra sancta.</hi> First I noted
hanging without the gate, at the least 100. lines or strings,
and in the gate is a great hole, whereat a little child may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly
creepe in: whereof demaunding the reason, they told me
that the hole serued to giue victuals at, for them which lie
within the Church, which are aboue 300. persons, men and
women, all Christians, and there liue they continually night
and day, nor can they haue passage in or out, but when the
Turkes doe open the gate for some Pilgrime, which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not sometimes in 14. daies: wherefore these Christian
liegers in the Church, haue there their whole housholds, and
boorded lodgings there builded for them. The strings before
spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, hanging at the gate, haue each one a bell fastened at
the lodgings, and when their seruants (which are without)
bring them any meate, each rings the bell belonging to his
houshold, &amp; so come accordingly (each knowing their owne
Bell) for receipts of their food. The seuerall sort of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
which I saw in this Church, I wil in order describe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you.</p>
            <p>First, the <hi>Romaines,</hi> for they beare the greatest way of al.
Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, the <hi>Greekes,</hi> for they are next in number to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi>
yet little better then slaues to the Turke. Thirdly,
the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who haue bin so long time seruants to the
Turke, that hauing forgotten their owne language, they vse
al their ceremonies in the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue, &amp; so I heard them.
The fourth sorte of Christians, are <hi>Nestorians,</hi> who are as
slaues to the Turke, and haue no other language then the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian.</hi>
The fift, are the <hi>Abashenes,</hi> being people of the land
of <hi>Prester Iohn.</hi> The sixt, are the <hi>Iacobines,</hi> who are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
Christians, but slaues likewise &amp; serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to the Turke.
All these (Christians in name) haue bought of the Turke
their seuerall places in this Church, and by-roomes for ease,
being neuer fewer in number of all these sixe sorts then 250.
or 300. continually there lying, &amp; praying after their ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner.
The places where they ordinarily vse to goe &amp; say their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions,
are thus as I describe them, &amp; as the <hi>Romane</hi> Friers
brought me to them; 1. the Piller whereat our Sauiour
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19852:11"/>
was whipped. 2. the place where he was imprisoned, while
they were preparing or making his Crosse. 3. where the
Souldiours deuided his garments. 4. where the crosse was
found by <hi>Q. Helena,</hi> which is at the foote of mount <hi>Caluarie,</hi>
&amp; hard by it is the chappel of the said Q. <hi>Helena.</hi> 5. the place
where Christ was crowned with thornes: which I could
not see, til I was glad to giue the <hi>Abashenes</hi> that kept it two
pieces of siluer. 6. the place where the Crosse being laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
on the ground, our Sauiour was nayled fast vnto it.
7. The place on the top of mount <hi>Caluarie</hi> wherin the crosse
stood when as hee suffered. 8. The Rocke that rent at his
crucifying, which is a thing well worth the beholding for it
is slitte, like as it had bin eleft with wedges and beetles,
euen from the top to the two third partes downward, as it
were through the brow and breast of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Rocke: nor is the rent
small, but so great in some places, that a man might easily
hide himselfe in it, and so groweth downeward lesse and lesse.
9. The place where the three <hi>Maries</hi> annointed Christ af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he was dead. 10. where he appeared to <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>
in the likenesse of a Gardiner, and hence we came to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher
it selfe, which is the last place where they vse any
prayers: from whence I went to see the Tombes of <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
and <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> and returning thence backe to
the Sepulcher, I measured the distaunce betweene place
and place, spending thus the time from fiue of the clocke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
night when I went in, vntill the next day at eleuen of
the clocke at my comming foorth, writing downe all things
which I thought note-worthie.</p>
            <p>My companion M. <hi>Iohn Burrell</hi> and I beyng thus come
foorth of the Church, we went to the <hi>Pater Guardians</hi> to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
where we heard tidings that fiue other Englishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were
arriued at the citie gates, directing towards <hi>Alepo.</hi> Their
names were M. <hi>William Bedle,</hi> preacher to the English mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
which are Liegers at <hi>Alepo:</hi> M. <hi>Edward Abbot,</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt
to the right Worshipfull sir <hi>Iohn Spenser:</hi> M. <hi>Geffrey
Kirbie,</hi> seruant to the worshipfull M. <hi>Paule Banning:</hi> and lie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
for them in <hi>Alepo:</hi> two other young men, the one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Iohn Elkynes,</hi> the other <hi>Iasper Tymne.</hi> These fiue (hearing
of my being there) came all to the house, and these (though
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19852:11"/>
they sawe not mine imprisonment, nor were with me at the
sight of those things in and about <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) can witnesse that
they were acquainted therewith at the gates, and estfice the
other truthes beside. These men, as also my companion M.
<hi>Iohn Burrell,</hi> I left behind me in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> departing thence
to see other places in the countrie of <hi>Palestine:</hi> but let me
first tel you, what I obserued in the cities scituation, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cause
I was enfourmed before I came to see it, that it was all rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
albeit (on the sight thereof) I found it otherwise, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a little Compasse about me, to set such places as I could
easily come by.</p>
            <p>Understand then first of all, that the very heart of the olde
citie was seated on mount <hi>Sion</hi> and mount <hi>Moria:</hi> to the
north part whereof, was mount <hi>Caluarie</hi> without the gates
of the old citie, about a stones cast and no further. But now
I finde this newe citie scituated so farre to the North part,
that it is almost quite off of mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Sion</hi> but yet not off mount
<hi>Moria,</hi> which was betweene mount <hi>Sion</hi> and mount <hi>Caluary:</hi>
so that now (vndoubtedly) the South walles of the citie, are
placed on the north foote of the hill of <hi>Sion.</hi> The east wall
which doth confront mount <hi>Oliuet,</hi> is a great part of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
wall, and so from the south-east angle north, a quarter
of a mile behinde mount <hi>Caluarie:</hi> so that mount <hi>Caluarie,</hi>
which was in former times a stones cast without the citie, and
the appointed place for ordinarie execution, I finde it to bee
now seated in the hart or middle of the new citie. This mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<hi>Caluarie</hi> is not so high as to be called a mount, but rather a
pyked or aspyring Rocke for I noated the scituation of it,
both when I was at the toppe of it, and when I came to the
Sepulcher: the Sepulcher being distant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it (I mean from
the foote of it) 173. foote, as I measured it: wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> vpon I
conclude, that the place of buriall, which <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Aramathia</hi>
made for him selfe, was fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foot of mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Caluarie,</hi> 173. foot
westward, in which place is the Sepulcher of our Sauiour.
The Sepulcher it selfe is two foote and a halfe high from
the grounde, eight foote in length, and foure foote broade
wanting three inches, being couered with a faire stone of
white colour. Ouer the Sepulcher is a Chappell builded,
the North wall whereof is ioyned close with the North side
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19852:12"/>
of the Sepulcher: and the Chappell is of like stone as the
Sepulcher is, consisting of fifteene foote in bredth, fiue and
twentie foote in length, and about fortie foote in height.
In this Chappel are alwais burning thirtie or forty Lamps,
but vpon Festiuall daies more: which are maintained by
gifts giuen at the death of Christians in <hi>Spaine, Florence,</hi> &amp;
other parts, to be kept continually burning: and the giuers
of these Lamps haue their names ingrauen about the vpper
edges of them, in letters of golde, standing in a band of gold
or siluer. This Chappell is inclosed with a Church, and yet
not it onely, but therewith is circkled in all the before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
holy places, vz. where Christ was whipt: where hee
was in prison: where his garments were deuided: where the
crosse was found: where he was crowned with thornes:
where he was nailed on the crosse: where the crosse stoode
when he suffered: where the vaile of the Temple rent: where
the three <hi>Maries</hi> annointed him: where he appeared to <hi>Marie
Magdalen:</hi> &amp; in briefe, al the most notable things either about
mount <hi>Caluarie,</hi> or <hi>Iosephes</hi> field of <hi>Aramathia,</hi> are enclosed
within the compasse of this Church, which was builded by
the fore-remembred Queene <hi>Helena,</hi> mother to <hi>Constantine</hi>
the greate, shee being (as I haue read in some Authors) an
English woman, and daughter to king <hi>Coell,</hi> that builded
<hi>Colchester:</hi> which being vrged to them, they denyed it. I
measured this Church within, and found it to bee 422. fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
about, the one side of it likewise I found to be 130. fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes:
thus much for mount <hi>Caluarie,</hi> which is in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
of the citie now.</p>
            <p>From the North-east angle of the citie, to the North-west,
is the shortest way of the citie, and from the North-west angle
to the South-west, is as farre as from the South-east to
the North-east: but from the South-west to the South-east,
which is the south wall that standeth on the foote of
mount <hi>Sion,</hi> I measured, and found it to be 3775. foote, which
is about three quarters of a mile. Upon this south-side of
the citie, is a great Iron gate, about which gate are laide
seauenteene pieces of brasse ordinance: this gate is as great
as the west gate of the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> &amp; exceeding strong,
the walles being very thicke, and on the south-side 50. or 60.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19852:12"/>
foote high: so much for the south wall and side of the citie.
The North wall is not altogither so long, but much stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
for on the Northside it hath beene often surprized, but
on the southside neuer: and on the East side it is impregnable
by reason of the edge of the hill which it standeth on, which
is fiue times as high as the wall. On the north side also are
25. pieces of brasse ordinance neere to the gate, which is of
Iron also: but what is in other places, as at the corners or
angles, I could not come to see, and demaund I durst not.
The east wall, containing the gate where saint <hi>Stephen</hi> was
stoned a little without, and to this day called saint <hi>Stephens</hi>
gate: I saw but fiue pieces of ordinance there, and they were
betweene the gate and the relique of port <hi>Aurea,</hi> which is to
the southward: and concerning the west side of the citie, at
the gate whereof I entred at my first arriuall, it is verie
strong likewise, and hath fifteene pieces of ordinance lying
neere togither, and all of brasse. This gate is also made of
Iron, and this West wall is altogither as long as the East
wall, but it standeth vpon the higher ground: so that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from the west to the west wall, you can see nothing
within the citie but the bare wall: but vpon mount <hi>Oliuet,</hi>
comming towards the citie from the East, you haue a verie
goodly prospect of the citie, by reason the citie standeth al on
the edge of the hill. To conclude, this citie of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is
the strongest of all the cities, that I haue yet seene
in my iourney, since I departed from the <hi>Grand Cayro:</hi> but
the rest of the countrey is very easie to be intreated: yet in the
citie of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> are three Christians for one Turke, and
many Christians in the countrey round about, but they all
liue poorely vnder the Turke.</p>
            <p>Now concerning how the country about <hi>Ierusalem</hi> lyeth,
for your more easie and perfect vnderstanding, I will famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
compare the seuerall places, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> some of our natiue Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

            </p>
            <p>The citie of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> where Christ our Sauiour was born,

            <p>The place where Christ fasted 40. daies and 40. nights,
called <hi>Quarranto,</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as <hi>Chelmesford</hi> is from
<hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The riuer <hi>Iordane</hi> (the very neerest part of it) is from <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
as <hi>Epping</hi> is from <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iericho,</hi> the neerest part of the plaine thereof, is from <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ursalem</hi>
as <hi>Lowton</hi> hall (sir <hi>Robert Worths</hi> house) is from
<hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lake of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as
<hi>Grauesend</hi> is from <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The riuer <hi>Iordane</hi> runneth into this Lake, and there dieth:
which is one of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> greatest secrets (in my minde) in the world,
that a fresh water should runne continually into this salt
Lake, and haue no issue out, but there dyeth, and the saide
Lake continuing still so salt, as no waight (of any reasonable
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19852:13"/>
substance) will sinke into it, but alwaies floateth: as, a deade
man, or a dead beast will neuer goe downe. Nay more, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
is brought into it by the riuer <hi>Iordane,</hi> of any reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
poyze besides the water, it abideth continually vpon the
<hi>superficies</hi> of the Lake, and so being tossed thereon by the
force of weather, maketh a cougealed forthe: which frothe
being driuen vp vpon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> banks, it becommeth a kinde of black
substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce like Pitch, which there they cal <hi>Bytumen,</hi> wherof I
haue brought some part fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence. This Lake is about eight
or nine miles broad, &amp; an hundred miles in length, stretching
from the north, where <hi>Iordane</hi> falles into it, vnto the south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and hath no further issue that hath bene seene by any
man.</p>
            <p>The field where the Angell brought tydings of ioy to the
Sheepheards, is from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as <hi>Greenwich</hi> from <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mount <hi>Oliuet</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as <hi>Bowe</hi> from <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bethanie</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as <hi>Blackwall</hi> from <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bethphage</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as <hi>Mile-end</hi> from <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The valley of <hi>Gethsemanie</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as <hi>Ratcliffe</hi>
fields from <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The brooke <hi>Cedron</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as the ditch without
<hi>Algate,</hi> which runnes to the Tower from <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mount <hi>Sion</hi> is now adioyning to new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke</hi>
to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus as plainely, as the time afforded me, haue I descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
vnto you the scituation of the city of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and how
the Country lyeth neere adioyning, which by the familiar
comparisons, you may the easter vnderstand. But come
we now to the most especiall thing of all, to see how iustly the
Scriptures are fulfilled, that <hi>Ierusalem <hi>should bee made a
heape of stones:</hi>
               </hi> the certainty and trueth whereof, all such as
haue bene there (considering and marking it so deepely as I
haue done) are able to report: for I could see no ground neer
to the citie by fifteene or sixteene miles distance (the plaine of
of <hi>Iericho</hi> excepted) but it is all a heape of stones, yea, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
such exceeding abundance, as I wonder how they can liue in
it. It for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, my selfe, M. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and my Moore, beeing
within fiue miles of the citie, and lodging in the fields all
night, I sent my Moore to a house not farre off, to buy vs
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19852:14"/>
some breade, for we had nothing to eate: and he returning to
vs, brought vs word, that the master of the house nor his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
did euer eate any bread in all their liues: for such is the
poore estate of the country, that a man may goe ten miles,
before you can see a plot of ground to feede a horse or a Cowe
on: yet the countries round about it, as <hi>Palestine</hi> on the one
side, <hi>Galilie</hi> on the other, and <hi>Syria</hi> to the west, are all most
goodly plentifull countries: and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it selfe, which I
thought to haue found the very fruitfullest place of all, is the
most barrennest place that I sawe in all my trauaile, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
onely excepted. I can compare no place in England
therewith for the like sterilitie, vnlesse the vnfruitfulst place
in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where there is nothing but rockes and stones, &amp;
daily (by the report of the inhabitants) the stones growe and
encrease more and more. In briefe, let all men that haue
beene there, or hereafter shall goe thither, speake but rightly
and without flattery, and then they will say with mee, that
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and fifteene miles about it euery way, is no other
then a heape of stones, and the barrennest place in all <hi>Meso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia.</hi>
And I am of this minde, that it is quite forsaken
of the Lord: for assuredly the greater part of Turkes, inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
there, doe vse all manner of most odious filthinesse: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch,
that the Christian dwellers there are forced to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
their children very young, yea, euen at ten yeares of age,
for feare least the Turkes should defile or alter them. Boyes
they keepe openly, &amp; shame not to set them at their doores, to
shew which of them hath the fairest: &amp; (as the better sort of
Christians haue told mee) there is not that sinne to be found
in the world, but it raigneth &amp; florisheth in <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they vse these words of it; <hi>Terra sancta, è no mais,</hi> to wit,
it is the Holy land in name, and no more: yea, the veriest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell
in al the countrie calleth it so, for in the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue
they call it by the name of <hi>Cutse,</hi> that is, holy.</p>
            <p>So, hauing my Pattent sealed with the great seale of the
<hi>Pater Guardian,</hi> and another Letter pattent, shewing that I
washed in the water of <hi>Iordane:</hi> the 31. of. March I depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in companie of my Moore that holpe me
out of prison. The 31. at night I came to <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> and
the 1. of <hi>Aprill</hi> to <hi>Ascalon:</hi> the 2. to <hi>Gaza,</hi> which is on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19852:14"/>
of the Deserts, where I hyred two wild <hi>Arabes</hi> with two
Dromedaries, to carie me to the citie of <hi>Grand Cayro.</hi> These
wild <hi>Arabes</hi> are no other then theeues, for they are such as
make daily prize of Christians, Turkes, Moores &amp; all sortes
of people, onely their owne nation excepted. With these two
<hi>Arabes</hi> and my Moore I departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Gaza,</hi> hauing no other
companie, and that day (being the 3. of <hi>Aprill</hi>) wee ran these
Dromedaries so hard, as at night I began to waxe very wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
wherefore I bad my Moore tell the <hi>Arabes,</hi> that I would
eate a fewe Raisins and rest a little: so we all alighted, for we
rode two vpon each beast, and hauing made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fast, we went
to supper. In meane while, one of the Dromedaries brake
loose, and ran backe againe, which made one of the <hi>Arabes</hi>
take the other beast and presently ride after. The other <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabe</hi>
went to a crosse way ouer a sand hill, and turnd himselfe
so, that both the men &amp; beasts were out of our sight. Then it
began to growe darke, and I hauing no companie but my
Moore, went alone to the top of the said hill, to see if I could
espie either of my theeues: when suddenly I sawe foure
other comming towards me: and by that time I recouered
the place where I left my Moore, one of them was close at
my heeles, and bad the Moore bring me to him. The Moore
tolde them that I had nothing, but was to be carried in foure
dayes to <hi>Cayro</hi> by two of their companions, whose names he
deliuered to them: whereon they replied, that if this were
true, they would doo me no hurt: but if the other returned not
with the beasts, then they would make prize of vs both. At
this time I had nothing to loose but the clothes on my back,
(verie dearely rated at ten groates value) for I had promised
the two <hi>Arabes,</hi> to pay them 24. pieces of gold, so soone as they
brought mee to the <hi>Grand Cayro:</hi> but my life was the thing
I most of all feared. Within 2. houres after, my two theeues
returned, when I might perceiue the other foure and them
to be all fellowes: so they gaue them a fewe Raisins and a
little water, whereupon the foure immediately departed: but
questionlesse if my Moore had not bin there with me, I had
bin caried quite away. The 4. day we came to a place where
the the euer had Lents, &amp; there they gaue me Camels milke,
and the next night we came to <hi>Salhia</hi> on the other side of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19852:15"/>
Deserts: where being sore shaken (albeit my bodie was well
wrapped with rollers) I was constrained to giue them ouer,
and hyre two horses.</p>
            <p>The Dromedarie is a kinde of beast like to a Camell, only
his head is lesser, and his legs somewhat longer, with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
small neck: and this difference (in comparison) is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
a Dromedary and a Camell, as is betweene a Grey-hound
and a Mastiffe dogge. During the foure daies,
the time of my comming from <hi>Gaza</hi> to <hi>Grand Cayro,</hi> I
neuer sawe them eate or drinke: it is saide they will fast from
water tun daies and neuer drinke, but not so long from me at.
Thus came I in 4. daies as farre, as I was going out from
<hi>Grand Cayro</hi> in twelue daies: yet for all this, I thinke a good
horse will run faster, but is no way able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue with this
beast, whose pase is a trot, or rather harder if it be possible.
At <hi>Cayro</hi> I paid my theeues and my two Horses, sending
them away, and gaue mine honest Moore sixe pieces of gold,
with some other things beside to his contentment, and sent
him to <hi>Mecha</hi> with the <hi>Carauan.</hi> The 7. I staied in <hi>Cayro</hi> al
day, and at night came to <hi>Bollake,</hi> where I tooke a boate: and
the 10. of <hi>Aprill</hi> at nine of the clocke in the morning, I came
to <hi>Rosetta,</hi> where taking horse with a <hi>Iauezarie,</hi> I came that
night to the walles of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where I lay all night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the gates were shut before I came. On the morrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the 11. I went aboord my Ship the <hi>Troyane,</hi> in
perfect health and safetie, I thanke my God,
hauing bin out in my Pilgrimage from
<hi>Alexandria</hi> iust 50. daies.</p>
