            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

AGAINST
TOBACCO:

Peſpicuouſly ſhewing the annoyance that it brings to Mankind, and
the great deprivation of Comfort and delight to the Female Sex,
with a ſpecial and ſignificant order ſet forth by the VVomen for
ſuppreſſing the general uſe thereof amongſt their Husbands, they
finding that Tobacco is the only Enemy to Pleaſure and Procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as they now plainly make it appear in this their Declaration:</p>

            <head>The Womens Complaint againſt Tobacco.</head>
            <p>AT a Seſſions of Women lately holden at Goſſips Hall; amongſt
the reſt of their grievances which were then debated of, this
great queſtion aroſe, concerning the uſe of Tobacco: whether
it was neceſſary that their Husbands ſhould take Tobacco or no?
a two minutes ſilence was made, (which was a great wonder) one more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
then the reſt, begins to declare her ſelf an utter Enemy to Tobacco, in
this manner.</p>
            <p>Neighbours and Friends quoth ſhe, I have been married to my Husband
about fourteen years, this Man hath been all his time a great Smoaker, and
to tell you the truth I was never got with child by him but once, and that
was ſo feebly done, that I may boldly ſay it was not half gotten, though
he is a Man as likely as any of his Neighbours, and as for my own part I am
ſure I am not in the leaſt defective, but am as apt and fit for the work of
generation as any of my Neighbours, nay I may ſay as likely to be got
with child as any Woman in <hi>England,</hi> let the other be what ſhe will, yet
this Man cannot do the feat, and the reaſon why it is not done, I muſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impute to his ſmoaking that Infernal <hi>Indian</hi> Weed, which they call To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
as for example. My next Neighbour Mrs. <hi>Twattle,</hi> her Husband
and ſhe have been married but nine years, and ſhe has brought him nine
brave luſty Children, well gotten Children, and the reaſon is, becauſe her
Husband never takes Tobacco; this I think may be a ſtrong evidence that
this filthy Weed is altogether deſtructive to procreation and robs a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of that ſweet natural delight, which ſhe ought to receive from her
Husband or from ſome body elſe: Thus much I can teſtifie of my ſelf, which
I deſire you would take into conſideration, and proceed to further Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
according to your beſt knowledge.</p>
            <p>This witty Oration ſo tickled the fancy and imagination of the reſt of
this Female Aſſembly, that they could ſcarce forbear ſpeaking all at once,
but ſilence was again commanded, but could not be obtained for a good
while, at length a handſome, comely, buxome Woman ſtands up, and deſires
to be heard, and paſſes her ſentence thus. Tobacco! O curſed Tobacco?
I wiſh that Man had been hang'd that firſt brought thee over into <hi>England;</hi>
for I have a pritty young Man to my Husband, as you all know Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
and by his countenance appears to be a good Womans Man, but I
am ſure 'tis I that find the contrary, I am ſure I have heard my Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66519:3"/>
ſay, (but indeed ſhe was old) that one Man was enough for one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
but (O this damn'd Tobacco) I am ſure I find it nothing ſo, for I could
diſpence with two or three ſuch Men as my Husband; Alas, what is once in
three Weeks? or once a Month for a young brisk Woman who could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
enjoy a Man every night; to be ſure; if not a little in the day time?
Well, if this be the effects of Tobacco, I am reſolv'd my Husband ſhall leave
it off, or Ile leave him off, and betake my ſelf to ſome other Man, that ſhall
take no Tobacco, but ſhall refreſh himſelf and me, ſometimes at the Tavern
with good brisk Wine, and a good Dinner or Supper, and ſometimes carry
me to ſee a Play, and ſometimes croſs the water to <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> and there
eat and drink well; and when the Night comes he ſhall wait on me home to
my Chamber, and there briskly to ſupply the wants of a longing Woman,
as it may be my ſelf; all this I will have inſtead of Tobacco, or elſe Ile want
of my will; who can endure to have a ſmoaky Chimny lye by her all night
nay more then all this, the ſtinking Brute muſt kiſs you, thinking to ſatiſfie
you with that; for alas he can do nothing elſe: For there is no Oyl left in
the Lamp, that is all waſted and conſumed by ſmoaking, and fuming that
ſtinking unnatural, deſtructive Devil, Tobacco: O how I am tranſported
with hatred and averſion towards this Weed, when I call to mind how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
it is to the pretious Nature of Man, which was made for the ſupply
of us Women; and not to be ſpung'd up by Tobacco, whoſe <hi>Original</hi> ſprung
from Hell, for the Devil (who thinks he never enſnares men faſt enough) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
this ſtinking dry Weed, that Men taking of it their mouths will ſo
ſtink, and their throats be ſo parched &amp; ſcorched with the heat thereof, that
they muſt drink exceſſively to quench the inflamation thereof, till at length
they become drunk; then are they fit for all manner of debauchery, which
is the ready road to deſtruction. How ſay you Neighbours have not I ſpoke
divinely, I am confident that there is ne're a Woman here, but will willingly
ſet her Seal to the truth of theſe Objections, which I have here experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
declared before this worthy Aſſembly. And if it comes to my turn
to ſpeak again I can yet ſay more on this ſubject, which may be as much ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
to the good and benefit of our Sex as what I have already ſpoken.</p>
            <p>She having thus ſpoken they ſignified their aſſention by a general applauſe
of what ſhe had declared: but ſtill ſtriving who ſhould be next; there was
a great and terrible combuſtion amongſt themſelves: till at length a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
Wife claimed the preheminence; ſaying, that ſhe (from the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſhe had learned from her Husbands books) could diſcover and lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
unto them, the many and injurious impediments that were occaſioned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66519:3"/>
in the body of Man by the poyſonous fume of the Tobacco: and how ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
it is to the Seminal; and luxurious parts of thoſe Men, that take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in ſucking in the venome of that dull Leaf.</p>
            <p>The reſt hearing her begin thus learnedly were reſolved to be ſilent a
while, and bridle their tongues, expecting that ſhe would unfold ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
evil that lay lurking in this broad Leaf of Tobacco: So ſhe begun her
diſcourſe after this skilful method.</p>
            <p>Neighbours (quoth ſhe) it has been my fortune to have been twice marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
Yet I muſt alſo let you know, that I am ſtill but young in years, not
ſurpaſſing the age of thirty: I was marryed to my firſt Husband but three
years, and then he dyed; and in that time I had no child by him; nor half
that ſatiſfaction from him, which a young Woman (as I was) might expect:
but I knew no better then; though I have had a large and comfortable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
ſince I buryed him, and married the Doctor; who is now my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
by whom I have had ſix Children, and all the delights which are due
to the Marriage bed. I once took an occaſion to ask him what he thought
might be the reaſon that I had no Children by my former Husband, who
in his life time appeared to be a likelyer Man then himſelf: he made me this
Anſwer, <hi>that he took too much Tobacco: For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Tobacco is of it ſelf
hot and dry, and deſtroys the Radical Moiſture;</hi> Now I hope you know
what is meant by the Radical Moiſture, for it is the ſeed in Man which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagates
and begets Children in women; Now that being wanting, thoſe
Men are altogether unfit for procreation; and this vacancy of Nature is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by Mens ſmoaking that baſe deſtructive Weed called Tobacco:
Nay a further account <hi>I</hi> can yet give you of it's operations; for reading late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in one of my Husbands books I found it thus written, firſt in Latine;</p>
            <p>Deſtrnctio generis humani Nicotiana: Semen radicale exaruit, Pericranio
venenum infundit; Sic vita humana perfecta. <hi>This I did not underſtand,
but reading on I found it thus Engliſhed.</hi> The Weed Tobacco is the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of humane Race, for it dryes up the Radical Moiſture, and throws ſuch poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous
vapours into the Brain, that it ſends many untimely unto their Graves.</p>
            <p>This being heard they began to be weary of ſilence every one ſtriving who
ſhould give this Doctreſs the greateſt applauſe: but ſhe deſired them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
for ſhe had not finiſht her diſcourſe; ſo then they again ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as before. Now ſays ſhe, which of you all will ſuffer your Husbands
or Bedfellows, to take this curſed Tobacco that fills their heads full of <hi>infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
conflagrations, proclamations, incendiaries, combuſtions,</hi> and ſuch like
hard words, which ſends them to their graves in the prime of their age; Nay
moreover it robs &amp; deprives us women of that conſolation &amp; delight which
every young woman ought to enjoy in a full meaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66519:4"/>
I ſay it ſteals away all thoſe happineſſes from us, even whilſt our Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
are alive with us, and at laſt tumbles them over the perch as they call
it, by conſumption Coughs, and ſuch like languiſhing diſtemper.</p>
            <p>At that they all unanimouſly cryed out away with this curſed Tobacco,
this venemous Indian Weed, we do clearly vote it down to be a common
and publick Enemy to Men, in robbing of them of their health and ſtrength
but a private and ſecret Enemy to Women in robbing them of their pleaſure
and Delight. Silence again was order'd by the grand Matron of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
who to tell you the truth was well ſtriken in years, and yet ſhe would
very fain have had her vote amongſt the reſt, but ſhe was very gently and
mildly prohibited by the younger ſort they very fairly alledging that there
was enough of them to mannage this cauſe, whoſe warmer blood runs briskly
through their veins, and truly it dos altogether belong to us, for Tobacco
could in no wiſe be injurious to her, whom Time already had deprived of
the enjoyments of mankind, but the harm it did was to thoſe who were
capable of receiving the benefits of Nature, but were made deſtitute there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
by reaſon of their ſottiſh Husbands, who make Chimneys of their throats
and change their Teeth from their natural colour to be as black as the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
ſtock; 'tis we I ſay, that have juſt cauſe to make our timely and moſt
juſt complaint againſt this ſurfeiting, unnaturall ſtinking Weed, leaſt in a few
years we find a diſſolution of mankind, and then I am ſure the World will
ſoon be at an end, for we Women be we never ſo active, cannot pleaſure one
another in that great work of generation, neither can we Multiply: Poor
Souls we ſhall be ſtarved unleſs a ſpeedy courſe be taken for the extirpation
and rooting up of this great and deſtructive enemy to our mournful Sex.</p>
            <p>The old Gentlewoman hearing theſe great reaſons, did willingly give
place to the younger Dames, confeſſing the truth, that her dancing days
were done, and ſhe cared no more for Man, then Man cared for her, but yet
Girls quoth ſhe, I have a fellow feeling of your ſad and languiſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
Well, well my pretty Rogues ſtand up for your privilledges, I was
young once and could as ill diſpence with a defective Man, as the briskeſt
Dame in town, though I ſay it my ſelf, and truly my pretty Lambs, I muſt
adviſe you to make the beſt uſe of your time, and take away thoſe things,
and cauſes, which in any wiſe do obſtruct or hinder your delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in this World: For truly, old age will quickly come. Time to my
knowledge hath Wings, and flies away with a ſwift pace, O methinks it is
but yeſterday ſince I embraced a pretty young Man a friend of mine, when
as alas it is now above twenty years ſince, yet I cannot forget the ſweet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66519:4"/>
and pleaſure I then receiv'd: In my Conſcience Girls, if I ſhould talk
of it a little longer, old bal'd pated Time would retreat, and I ſhould
become young again; but O alas the Chollick now doth gripe me, the
Cramp doth draw my Limbs together ſorely, Diſeaſes encompaſs me round
about, and I muſt give way to younger heads to manage this great work of
Women-kind, and when the Bill is paſs'd for the voting down of this filthy
Tobacco, if I cannot put my hand to it, to ſhew my willingneſs and my
well wiſhings to our Sex, I will put one finger to it, and thus I will take my
leave of you, finding my ſelf ſomething faint, in ſpeaking what I have ſaid
already, Ah this old Age, I ſay it cannot be hid, be ſure you vigorouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
againſt this curſed Tobacco, that is your open enemy, and ſo farewell.</p>
            <p>With that they all gave her many and hearty thanks, for her good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
and adviſe, either of them being more ſenſible of the great injuries it did
their Husbands (and ſo conſequently themſelves) then ſhe was, by reaſon
old Age had not yet overtaken them.</p>
            <p>Now again, it was to be conſidered who ſhould ſpeak next, all of them
ſtill having ſomething to ſay and declare, though much to the ſame effect
which had been ſaid already; till at length a nimble tongued Laſs, deſired
that her verdict might be heard, not doubting (as ſhe told them) that what
ſhe had to offer and propoſe, might be as ſignificant and effectual to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
in hand, as any thing that had been ſaid and declared by any of them:
for truly ſhe had the ſence of fellow feeling upon her as much as the beſt of
them, though as yet not actually known the pleaſures of Man: for (ſaith
ſhe) I am now upwards of ſeventeen, and by your ſelves you may know
that a Woman in my condition has a longing deſire to be further ſatiſfied
concerning the enjoyment of mankind.</p>
            <p>They hearing her ſo violently urge upon this point, gave order that ſhe
ſhould be heard with great attention and diligence, not knowing but her
aggrievances might equally compare with their own, ſo they commanded
her to ſpeak as boldly as her Sex and tender years would admit and allow of:
ſo ſhe declared her ſelf briefly after this manner. Neighbours (quoth ſhe)
I underſtand that the drift of our preſent buſineſs is to diſanul and make
void this Weed Tobacco, and to prohibit and forbid all mankind in general
as well Batchelors as married Men, from taking or ſmoaking any more of
it, from this time forward, and for evermore.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſons that I ſhall infer upon my own account (for I ſuppoſe
you will expect that I ſhould nominate ſome principal grounds) ſhall be
theſe. I being as yet a Virgin (though it may be contrary to my own
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66519:5"/>
will ſhall be afraid to marry, fearing I ſhould marry and tye my ſelf to a
Man that ſhould take Tobacco, and that I thereby ſhould be deprived of
thoſe enjoyments and delight which every Woman expects after Marriage:
For you do all agree with me that Tobacco is the great Thief that robs all
our Sex of their natural pleaſures: The apprehenſion and fear of this To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco
for ought I know, may be the utter ruine and deſtruction, not only of
my ſelf, but of many thouſand Damſels more, for it may cauſe them never
to marry, expecting no comfort nor conſolation from a ſmoaker: ſo that
they will be forced to live and dye Maids as they call us, then ſhall we be
forced, as our great Grandmothers have left upon record, to lead Apes in
Purgatory; the ſence of which torment I think is ſufficient to diſſwade
all Men from taking Tobacco, if they have any tenderneſs of hearts towards
us, and to perſwade you the Governours of this honourable Aſſembly to
enact ſomething ſo ſtrong, that all Men may be afraid hence-forward to
ſmoak any more of that ſtinking weed: and that I leave to your wiſer
breaſts to go forward with; for you have been (as you have declared) ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ſufferers by your Husbands ſmoaking this fuming and ſuffocating <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Leaf. She having thus ended they gave a general conſent to what ſhe
had ſaid to be very ſignificant; and now they proceed to make an order
order for the prohibition of their Husbands taking Tobacco, and thus they
begun.</p>
            <p>Imprimis, <hi>We do declare that our Will and Pleaſure is, that no Man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
Married or unmarryed, under the Age of fifty years old,</hi> (then ſtarted
up a young woman and ſaid, pray let it be ſixty) <hi>No, no, ſaid ſhe hold your
peace, I ſay no Man under the Age of fifty years old, ſhall at any time, or
upon any occaſion whatſoever, take, ſmoak, or draw into his Mouth the ſmoak
of that curſed ſtinking Weed called Tobacco, for the grounds and Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned,
which are ſufficiently known to our ſelves. Now if any Man
ſhall at any time he perverſe, and will not obey theſe our orders; then it ſhall be
lawful for the Wife of ſuch a man, to chooſe, and take unto her ſelf, a Friend,
or Gallant, ſuch a man as ſhall ſeem moſt pleaſant in her Eyes: this we do li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
and permit in caſe of the like default.</hi>
