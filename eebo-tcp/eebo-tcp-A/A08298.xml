            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F I were demanded (Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable) I could yeeld a reason why I giue your Lady-ship this little plaine Poeme, vnder the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of a <hi>Pensiue Soules delight,</hi> but that your Ladiship is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnacquainted with some causes that may right well worke me pensiue. The cause is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and obserued of many, but felt of my selfe and mine only. The cause of my delight is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, common, and knowne to all, but felt (with effect) of the faithfull and loyall onely. Can any faithfull soule but sigh (my good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,) to see and consider, the sundry daungers, that haue bene, and are daily plotted and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, against her highnesse most innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and Royall state? And againe, can any, but reioyce and delight to see her still blessed &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
<pb facs="tcp:13655:3"/>
and the practizers still found out, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured and condemned? And who seeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pensiuenesse and sorrow, her Maiesties na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue subiects, our owne country-men, brethren and kindred, to become Traytors, to their, and our most gratious Queene, &amp; treacherous to vs their country-men &amp; allyes? And againe, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not to see &amp; obserue, how all their deuises come to nought, her Maiestie preserued, &amp; our selues deliuered? And again, who greeueth not to consider from whom these practises and the grounds of these treasons proceed? From a man pretending to be the high and sole <hi>Vicar of Christ</hi> in earth, who cannot erre in his purposes and proceedings, because they are all couered, (euen murthers of innocent men, yea Princes, raising warre within, and between kingdomes,) with the pretence of religion and glorifying God, the highest point of blasphemy. But who reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not to see him discouered <hi>Antichrist, the man of sinne?</hi> and his vndermining and treasonable messengers, <hi>Locustes?</hi> And who reioyceth not to see them in some measure abandoned, sith they will not be reclaimed? But more, who reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not to see and consider her Maiesties im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable constancie, in louing, in imbracing,
<pb facs="tcp:13655:3"/>
and in maintaining the infallable trueth? and our selues vnder her, and by her, to enioy the same? A subiect worthie of a more serious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. But because many worthie workes are exta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their discouery, some too great of price for poore men, and some too learned for the simple. And such serious Treatises ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, because they delight not all humours, I thought it not vnfit to put the inferiour multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in minde, in this kinde of writing, what causes they haue to sighe and to sing, to grieue and reioyce: And that with mee they may haue all will, as they haue cause, to pray for the continuance of the true causes of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing, the maintenance of Religion, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of her highnesse. <hi>The length of dayes,</hi> vouchsafe her length of dayes: <hi>the Lyon of Iudah</hi> rent her enemies in peeces: And high <hi>Iehouah,</hi> graunt that vnder her we may all liue in true loue, towards her, that loueth him, who in his loue gaue her to vs. That we in her might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sorrow to see the falles of traytors in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then traytors to tryumph in the successe of their attempts in insolencie.</p>
