            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <dateline>PARIS, February 1659.</dateline>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have received from the hands of <hi>Monſieur Grammont</hi> yours of the 11. and 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. inſtant, and cannot find that cauſe of ſo great rejoycing as both expreſs: for all doth but amount to filling up the Houſe, and by their Qualifications, Elections ſhall be ſo ordered, that it will be nothing more then a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> which conſiſteth in electing, voting and fitting (as formerly) at the pleaſure of the Sword. If the old conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, then thoſe worthy Gentlemen which are excluded, ought to take their places: If a new one be called, then all parties as Subjects equally concerned without Reſtriction or Qualifications, (as they call it) ought to be capable of Election; but if their malice be ſo rooted againſt the Cavaleer, or Kings party (who have as much reaſon to wiſh and act the good of thoſe nations as any others) that they muſt not be admitted: Then 'tis but reaſon and juſtice, that thoſe that have purchaſed great eſtates, and enjoy offices military and civill, ſhould be ſo too. For they are the only people that keep up theſe diſtractions for their own benefit.</p>
            <p>If Looſers (as the Proverb is) may not have leave to ſpeak; it is not fit Gainers ſhould, whoſe Intereſt now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes Liberty to thoſe Sufferers, and is but particular to the grand general one. And ſhall the Royal party alwayes looſe a national Right, who have paid a compounded price of miſeries for their Eſtates, which did ſurely give them a like Freedome as before? Otherwiſe what ſignifies their concernments to the publick in any thing? And how they can make them more then Equals in the payment of Taxes and Preſſures, and deny them liberty in this, is altogether unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, in that it deſtroyes them their Birth-Right, and in every reſpect leſſens the Liberties of the Subject ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or contended for. So that unleſs this be allowed, that party is ſtill lyable (as not having the benefit of the Laws) to the thraldom and laſh of every Innovator and Power whatſoever; witneſs their <hi>Decimation</hi> by the late Tyrant, who renewed their ſorrows at his pleaſure. And whereas ſome Pamphlets would perſwade a belief, that <hi>England</hi> will never endure its primitive practice or worſhip in Religion; and that Kingly Government, by reaſon of preſent Intereſts muſt needs be extinguiſhed; For a ſufficient Anſwer, it will be worth our time to reflect upon thoſe Intereſts. And what hath followed thereupon ſince the Interruption of that Parliament (famous for theit Vote in order to a peace with the late King) <hi>Anno,</hi> 1648. but confuſion in great meaſure, occaſioned by the diſobedience of the then Army-Officers, animated thereunto by ſome Members whoſe Intereſt is thus declared for? Therefore to urge any thing which is apparently deſtructive to a known and ſolid experimental Welfare in Eſtates and Kingdomes, cannot be laſting, ſafe or rational. Neither ſo long as Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies guard, and force Parliamentary Counſels (to comply with their rude and indigeſted Models, to uphold corrupt Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, which hath coſt the people ſo many millions conteſting againſt, and for their lawful King) no foundation can poſſibly be laid but what is arbitrary and perfectly deſtructive to the whole. For if the wiſdom of the Rulers be thus obſtructed, all other Eſſayes ſhall for ever be fruitleſs; and this I think may without errour paſs as a <hi>Doom</hi> upon thoſe Kingdoms; and fondly to conclude from their confuſed Notions and circumſtances that a pretended Common-wealth of 8. or 10. years troubleſome growth, is or can be better then a Monarchy of above a thouſand years continuance that comparatively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed no grievances, is a weakneſs to believe. Therefore, you Phariſees, if this ſhall not convince, obſerve the Order, Government and Rule of Heaven and Earth, of God in the Trinity, of Nature, and ſince the Creation, of Families, of every particular Countrey and people, nay the beaſts of the feild: And then tel me, if you can, if this doth not proclaim Monarchical Government to be according to the Will of God and our Saviour? There can be no Competitors in dominion in one and the ſame thing, without enraging the hearts of men; therefore unſafe is that Nation who hath ſuch Rivals. A Common-wealth is conſiſtent with, and moſt ſplendid under Regal Government, inſomuch as it unites all to that center.</p>
            <p>Now if this be not duly conſidered, I have one ſtep farther to ſtifle their Objections and fatal intereſt ſo much plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, if they will ſtand to that purity of Spirit which they pretend, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſolemn Leagues and Covenants made by themſelves, in which they ſwore Allegiance, forces this as a duty to the perſon of the King, and his Poſterity; and yet the one by violence is cut off, and the other an exile expoſed to the mercy of ſtrangers, hazarding both ſoul and body: In ſum, Reſtitution is one great mark of the people of God: And ſo long as the gain thus cleaves to their fingers, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is not in their hearts.</p>
            <p>Then, is it not great folly to countenance ſuch intereſts as theſe which hath coſt that Nation more in 10. years to defend, then would maintain the other in honour almoſt a thouſand years, had he nothing of right belonging unto him. And how they can expect a ſettlement by (ſhadows of Authority) men of corrupt principles laden with its ſpoiles, (by which they continue the force put upon their Fellow members by the violence of Armies) no man hath yet diſcovered. Unleſs (with the late tyranical Uſurper <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi>) we ſhould look upon Perjury and Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as no ſin, we cannot tolerate Armies (which are but ſervants) to be Lawgivers, or impoſe them upon the Rulers; from whence I hope, that victorious General conſulting with his Army, the expectations of the world, will conclude, that bare ſuppoſitions againſt a King, is no ſolid Argument for a Common-wealth as yet unborn: Hence therefore let <hi>England</hi> ſing out the praiſes of God for their lawfull King, who with his Royal Father prayed for, and loved them in the dayes of their extremity.</p>
