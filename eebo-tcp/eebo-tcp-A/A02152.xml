            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The maides hearing their Lady in so good a vain were glad,

as he feared in any wise to offer her occasion of displeasure, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by fearing ot displease him, meaning that the chiefest
point of wisdome in a good wife, is to make a conquest of her
husband by obedience. <hi>Aristides</hi> the true and perfect Iusticiari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of his time, caused the portraiture of a woman figured on her
knées, to be caried before y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Brydes at their espousals, to signifie
that they meant now to obey &amp; submit, not to rule or command,
for quoth he, such fond and fanastick women as make choise of
effeminate Husbands, thereby to challenge a soueraine superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
ouer them, may rightly be compared to chose presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fooles y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> had rather be masters of blind men, then seruants
to the discréete and learned, which caused <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Androgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
to say that a wise woman ought to thinke hir husbands ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes of her life, which if they be good, she must take as
a forme of her actions, if they be bad, she must brooke with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
His reason is thus. As a looking glasse or Christal though
most curiously set in Ebonie, serueth to small purpose if it doth
not liuely represent the proportion and lineaments of the face
inspicient: so a woman, though rich &amp; beautifull, deserueth smal
prayse or fauour, if the course of her life be not directed after her
husbands compasse. And as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mathematicall lines which Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians

               <hi>ans,</hi> prouiding Soldiours, money and Munition, took her iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

he sent straight to commaund <hi>Octauia</hi> that she should depart

would not suffer it, kéeping <hi>Anthonies</hi> children, that hée

                     <p>IF the inward affects of the minde be manifested by outward
effects or the brow the bashful bewrayer of secrets, and yet
the true discouerer of thoughts, may bée credited, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of <hi>Aegipt</hi> in his loues resembleth the Pyne trée, whose
leaues remaine in one colour but one day: Well might the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
fo wise Clarks haue bin caueats of my likely misfortune:
for they say Princes affections as they are glorious so they are
brittle: that he fauour of Kings hangs in their eye lids ready
with euery winke to be wiped out: that as they are full of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty
and aboue law, so they are full of inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stancy, because with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
law: this which other spoke by proofe, now I alledge by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience:
for your Highnes abridgeth me of my wonted allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
not onely in expence but in lookes, so that I account that
day happy when <hi>Saladine</hi> but glanceth at <hi>Olinda.</hi> The mistris
of my mishap is thy iniurious wife <hi>Barmenissa,</hi> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I wish
thy ill fortunes &amp; my miseries: she with a fained obedience séek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to inueagle thée with a conceipt of her loue, who if shée did
loue, could not content, for she wants the eye pleasure, beauty:
thou tickled with an inconstant humour dost listen to the melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the old Syren, whose necke shadowed with wrinckles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foords
but had harmony: Kéep not <hi>(Saladine)</hi> fire and water in
one hand: in running with the Hare hold not with the Hound:
beare not both a Sword and an Oliue. <hi>Paris</hi> gaue sentence but
on <hi>Venus</hi> part, affection brooketh no diuision? therefore if thou
loue <hi>Olinda,</hi> hate <hi>Barmenissa:</hi> follow the example of <hi>Anthony,</hi>
who after his choyce of thy Countriwoman neuer fauoured
<hi>Octauia:</hi> tis beauty that mertis a Crowne, and as well would
the Diadem of <hi>Aegipt</hi> beséeme they Lemons head, as thy wiues:
<pb facs="tcp:3579:10"/>
I should, and yet were loth to flatter in saying what I would
not: but if I may haue free libertie to speake what I think, my
verdit shall be soone giuen. I confesse that what pleaseth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought to content the sonne: and therefore I count the will
of <hi>Saladyne</hi> a lawe to <hi>Garinter:</hi> yet as obedience wisheth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
so Nature willeth with a friendly denyall to diswade from
things that offende not onely men, but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> are euen hatefull to the
Gods. I say therefore that <hi>Saladyne</hi> should get more honour by
exyling <hi>Olynda,</hi> not onely from <hi>Babylon,</hi> but out of all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> then if he had obtayned more tryumphes then
that inuincible <hi>Caesar.</hi> No doubt your Grace shall soone, nay I
feare to soone, finde my words to be true, that in hoping to get a
swéete content you gayne a sower mislike: like to them which
pleased with the colour of the trée <hi>Lotos,</hi> are poysoned assoone as
they taste of the Apples.</p>

with a modest countenance, as nothing grudging at the

sonne the law of nature willes thée to be partner of thy
mothers misfortunes, yet the Gods, whose lawes are aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
commaunds that thou gainsay not the Edict of thy father:
For as <hi>Proclus</hi> the Academick affirmes, there is nothing which
we ought more to regard then duetie and obedience: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
of the father is not to bée limited by the conceipt of the

ought to be without denials, first the frowne of a father (saith <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pictetus</hi>)
is like the eleuation of a Commet which foreshewes

thy father in thought, least the gods grudging at thy secret diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience

art his subiect, and be thy soueraine, what duetie is due to such a

no sooner came at the Court, but caused the Lords that were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers
of this treason to be apprehended, who willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed

them to warde: and now to make proofe of <hi>Olyndas</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
he counterfeated a more déeper affection then euer he did,
and for confirmation thereof, he gaue her free libertie to make
choise of thrée things without denyall whatsoeuer she would

where then he kept his Court with notice also that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
that day the Quéene should fréely aske thrée things of the

this graunt, and began to mutinie, that a gracelesse Concubine
should reape such fauours without desart. The olde Empresse,

of mariage were celebrated my husbands dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.
The eldest Sister hearing how cunningly &amp; yet crookedly
this prettie Oratresse aimed at the matter, could not suffer to
heare so long a tale without replye, and therefore went thus
roundly to the purpose.</p>
               <p>Sister ill might <hi>Phillis</hi> haue blamed <hi>Dido</hi> for her folly sith
she her self intertained stragling <hi>Demophon</hi> for a friend: The
<hi>Cynicks</hi> that inueighed against other mens faults were seldo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
culpable in the same crime: they which will haue their censures
peremptorie, must not build their reasons on vncertain princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
therefore wipe your nose on your owne sleeue, and if you
spie where my shooe wrings me, looke to the length of your own
last: for in obiecting selfeloue to me you fall a sléepe in the swéet
conceipt of your owne praise: which indéed wisely you frame to

hazard on the chance of fame, sith your deserts are so small as
report is blind on y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> side which lookes to your vertues: the force
of your reasons drawne from the authority of propagation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
nature and nurture for proofes of your vertues, are too
light to counterpaise w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a Crowne: for we oft sée that Natures
onely error is found in the dissimilitude of linage: so that the trée
bringing foorth faire blos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nipped in the bud with vntimely weather, or hindred with cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillers,
that it neuer proue good &amp; perfect fruite. The Cedar
trée is faire of it self, but the fruite either none or very bad: Tis
no opinion to say a good father a good child, in that time oft ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
an alteration of Nature. But your husband was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to haue pleaded your interest: mary I feare his conscience
tels him the Crowne hangs too bye for his reach, sith he must
be faine to attaine to it by your vertues.</p>
               <p>The yongest Sister hearing how vnreuerently they brabled
before the King, began to blush: which <hi>Ariamenes</hi> espying, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in her face the very purtraiture of vertue, demanded of her
why hearing her sisters so hard by the eares for a Crowne shée
said nothing? her answere was thus briefe and pithy. He that
gaineth a Crowne getteth care, is it not folly then to hunt after
losse? The King looking for a longer discourse, and seeing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his expectation that she was onely short and swéete, prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
still inquestioning, and demaunded what vertues she had
that might deserue so royall a benefit? This quoth she, that wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

others talke, yet being a woman I can hold my peace. <hi>Ariame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and all the Nobility of <hi>Delphos</hi> wondred at the modestie
of the young Lady, that contrary to her naturall disposition
could so well bridle her affections. Therfore dehating the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
betwixt them which of the thrée were most vertuous: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they found by proofe that the other Ladies were both o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
and chast: yet for that they wanted silence, which (sayd
<hi>Ariamenes</hi>) comprehended in it all other vertues, they mist of
the cushion, and the King created his youngest Sonne heire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
to the Kingdome.</p>

tongue, tolde her that this tale was a good president for her to
direct her course, séeing silence was so profitable. Tush quoth <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi>
feare not you Madame: for when I haue such a proffer
as a Crowne, I will gaze so fast at that, that I will forget my
prattle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in saith my lippes are too course for such Lettice, and
so hye hangs the Grapes that the Foxe will eate none. Well
Madame, I know your meaning, but for all t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

may be good siluer, sith silence is a vertue amongst women:
but yet I sée no reason of necessity, séeing nature hath béene so

As thus they were about to part with these merry quips, a
messenger came hastily rushing in, who tolde <hi>Penelope</hi> that <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisses,</hi>

him in post to the Sea: where what news he heard of his father
I know not. But thus abruptly this night was the discourse
broken off: but for that fell out after his home comming, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
