            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WEre I indeed a greater Master of
Verse, than the best of those,
whether of our own Country-Men,
or Foreigners, whose several manners I
have in the following Compositions, endeavoured
to imitate, I durst not yet presume to make an
<hi>humble Present</hi> of them to <hi>your Grace,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
invited by the Sacredness of the most noble
Argument. An Argument so Sacred (as to the
greatest part of the Subjects, if not spoil'd by
<pb facs="tcp:95877:3"/>
my unskilful handling) that it must be ever
acknowledged worthy <hi>your Grace;</hi> and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
that the best and most refined Spirits of the
Christian Church have happily labour'd in them,
whose Design his late MAJESTY of <hi>ever
Blessed Memory,</hi> was particularly pleased
to Encourage and Promote. To attest this,
were it either necessary, or pertinent, I might
reckon up several Names, not unknown to
<hi>your Grace,</hi> but shall, instead of all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my self with the generally approved Mr.
<hi>George Sandy's,</hi> who first under so Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a Prince, opened the way to Divine Poesy
in this Nation, and gave it a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Credit; from whose Hands, as not
unbecoming <hi>His Royal Self,</hi> He vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to accept a short Paraphrase upon the
<hi>Canticles;</hi> not long after the time that the
Pious <hi>Sieur Godeau</hi> had with much success
made a Dedication of the same Divine Song,
<pb facs="tcp:95877:3"/>
under the Title of <hi>Sacred Eclogues,</hi> with
some few other Religious <hi>Stanzas</hi> to the great
Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Honours sake I here mention the Bishop
of <hi>Grasse,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sandy's,</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I may both <hi>Apologize</hi> for my self, if
there be need, and defend the best that I can
against the most Censorious and Critical, the
affixing <hi>your Graces</hi> Name, to the same
<hi>Canticles,</hi> and a few other <hi>English Rimes;</hi>
of which, for the performance, as being my
own, tho I have no better opinion than I ought,
or than the great Judges of Verse in the Town
shall allow they deserve (it may be not so good)
yet if, as in the first place in this Dedication,
they are intended, they shall serve most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to express my Duty without reflection of
Dishonour upon <hi>your Grace,</hi> and be so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
I shall nor wish for my self greater
Credit, nor for them a better Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:95877:4"/>
to such as have any gust for Christian
Poesy.</p>
            <p>That God Almighty may have <hi>your Grace</hi>
in his perpetual and most mercifull Protection,
and long, very long continue you an invaluable
Blessing to this his best of Churches, is the

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>HAVING some Years since, before my
Admission into Holy Orders, in my
Preface to the Paraphrase upon the
<hi>Psalms,</hi> discours'd at large concerning
Christian Poesy, without resuming that Subject, or
prosecuting it any further, I shall here do very little
more than give the Reader an account of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Papers.</p>
            <p>Being therefore very often solicited to Print,
what I had by me in Verse, or, if not all, such
Rhythms at least, as I thought most proper to my
present condition, amongst a great many more, I with
difficulty, and but very late resolved upon those, which
are now herewith Published, <hi>The Song of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
or the <hi>Canticles;</hi> and other <hi>Hymns,</hi> directly
laid down in Holy Scripture, with some few Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
more, whose Argument, as to the greatest part
of them, is either thence taken, or thither may be
referr'd.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Canticles,</hi> which tho almost last done,
is put in the first place: I was a long while deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from attempting its Version, or Paraphrase ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
tho often provoked, I often, and with infinite
<pb facs="tcp:95877:10"/>
desire thought of it, by the sublimeness of the Subject,
and that little acquaintance, which not only my self,
I ingenuously confess, but this, and the preceding
Ages, I fear, for many Centuries back, have had with
the Eastern Poesy; whose manner of Wit seems to
be altogether different<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from ours, and not to be
brought under those Laws, which the <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Latine,</hi> and the Modern from them have assigned
Verse. For their Metaphors, as appears in our
Prosaic Versions, and especially upon Collation to
any who are but reasonably skill'd in the Oriental
Languages, are extremely bold, their Comparisons,
Allusions, and Similitudes such, as we on this side of
the World can hardly admit as decent, if at all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable;
and their Transitions, with frequent
shifting of Persons so <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (for I cannot
well express it in <hi>English,</hi> with such large and scarce
accountable Breaches) that there lacks a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of words to be inserted between Period and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
to render the Coherence tolerable. The not
throughly considering this (which yet possibly might
be avoided, nor it may be would at all have been,
if every Sentence were reduced to its proper place
and station, and that there had not been mistakes in
transcribing the Original Copies (as some think there
have) has been one occasion in my Opinion, that
of all the Versions I have met with (either in <hi>Greek</hi>
or <hi>Latine,</hi> or our own <hi>English,</hi> and other the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Languages of the best esteem) of the Song<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
by me here `Paraphras'd, and particularly of the
<pb facs="tcp:95877:10"/>
               <hi>Canticles,</hi> very few are to be reckoned Verse, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the Character of Number, and Cadence
reaches, and fewer yet tolerable Poetry: Bare Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations
for the greatest part, but made more uneasie
to be read, and much more perplext, as to the Sense,
by the Tortures they have been put to for the Verse,
or Rhythms-sake. Among the several other Papers
that we have lost of the Excellent and Divine <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,</hi>
one of the happiest Poets that this Nation ever
bred, (and out of it the World, it may be (all
things considered) had not his Fellow, excepting
only such as were immediately Inspired) I bewail
nothing me-thinks so much, as his Version of the
<hi>Canticles.</hi> For doubtless, in my poor Judgment,
never was Man better made for such a Work, and
the Song it self so directly suited, with his Genius,
and manner of Poetry (that I mean, wherein he
best shews and even excels himself, <hi>His Shepherds
Kalender,</hi> and other occasional Poems, for I cannot yet
say the same directly for his <hi>Faery Queen</hi> design'd
for an Heroic Poem) that it could not but from him
receive the last Perfection, whereof it was capable out
of its Original. Others, as I hinted before, have since
attempted it, and in <hi>English</hi> my self now among the
rest, but how successfully we must all leave both to those
who have skill to judg, and to those who have not to
censure, and sit down, having pleased our selves, (if yet
our selves are pleased) as contented under their Doom
as we can; for since we will be Rhythming, and
Printing too forsooth, I know no other remedy. I
<pb facs="tcp:95877:11"/>
must confess it is a Song above the flight of Mortal
Wit, and has been ever lookt upon by the Sober and
Religious, as the most Noble, tho most Mysterious,
and difficult part of the Old Testament. There are
I know, (but they are but some few I hope) in this,
and others there have been, in the last Age, who, tho
else very Learned, and it is to be charitably supposed
truly Pious, without just cause have gone about to
question whether it ever intended any more than it
expressed, as to the Letter, and by debasing it to
that, which it seemed most to sound, <hi>Humane Love,</hi>
to call it no worse, have insinuated at least, (because
<hi>Theocritus,</hi> and some other of the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi>
and <hi>Latine</hi> Poets, have a few like Phrases in their
amorous Compositions, either hence first taken, as
the most ancient Original in the kind, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
as may be conjectured, to the <hi>Greeks</hi> by the
Translation of the <hi>LXXII,</hi> and by them Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to the <hi>Latines,</hi> by both light upon by chance)
that it is unworthy the place where it stands; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the opinion of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
had and still has, antiquated, and broken as
it is, for it the greatest Reverence; reputed it
through all Ages uncontrovertedly Canonical, of
Sense purely, and only Mystical, and thereupon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
<hi>Salomon,</hi> the inspired Author, to be the
most Spirituous and Heavenly Interpreter of their
Law: And contrary also to the Judgment of the
Christian Church, which from our Lord's time down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
(and in the beginning of the Seventh Century,
<pb facs="tcp:95877:11"/>
if not in the latter end of the Sixt, <hi>Gregory the
Great,</hi> piously Commented upon it) has trodden in
the same steps, enlarging only, as I may say, the
Lines of Communication, and transferring to the
Assembly of the Faithful, under the Gospel, what
the <hi>Jews</hi> confined to the Synagogue: Should we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it only, or even chiefly, if at all according
to the Letter, terminating our Conceptions in the
bare words, it might very easily become the occasion
of Scandal to the unwary Reader; nay, without
doubt had been so to the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves, at its first
appearance; the severity of that Nation not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Female Sex, we may be assured, such
open demonstrations of Love, as are more than once
there expressed. And this possibly might be one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
amongst many other to be urged from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity,
which is in Youth especially, to that passion,
too apt from the least spark to take fire, that this
Book, together with the three first Chapters of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis,</hi>
and the beginning, and end of the Prophecy
of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> from the Fortieth Chapter, was only
permitted them to read, who had arrived to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal
Age, as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> notes in his Prologue to
that Prophet, that is, the Thirtieth Year, in whom
Youthful Heats, by that time, were thought to be
somewhat allayed, and who thereupon would not be
in so great danger to pervert the Divine Text to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
and wanton Imaginations. Whether <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
at first composed it to represent his own Loves,
and as an Epithalamium upon his Marriages with
<pb facs="tcp:95877:12"/>
               <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter, and the <hi>Sulamite,</hi> one or both,
I leave to others to dispute; tho for my part, gues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
as we can but guess at the time of those Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
and the penning this Divine Song, I think
he only took occasion thence, as from a thing long
before done (if from thence he took any occasion at
all) to give his Muse, as I may call it, an higher
flight, and under the terms of the <hi>Spouse</hi> and her
<hi>Beloved,</hi> of which latter himself in his own Person
was to be the Type (the Spouse, whether a Stranger of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> Symbolical of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be called, or of
<hi>Jewish</hi> Parentage, Typical of the Seed of <hi>Abraham)</hi> to
sing the greatest loves this World e're knew, and which
shall be our employment through all Eternity to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.
The Divine Love to whole Mankind both
<hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> (these first call'd, and those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
under the Person of the <hi>Sulamite</hi> to return)
expressed in the Incarnation of the Son of God,
(who of two has made One, breaking down the Wall
of Partition) and continued through all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
and the very manner of his Appearance in our
Flesh, in order to our Salvation. Some hereby would
have the Glories and Prerogatives of the Jewish State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
both Civil, and Ecclesiastical, and even of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
under <hi>Salomon</hi>'s auspicious Reign, to be signified
under the Similitude of a beautiful Virgin just mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riageable,
and the rather because of those Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
taken from Places, which if attributed to the
Female Sex, as according to the Letter they sound,
and our kind of Wit, as it is called, are so hard, in
their opinions so uncooth, stiff, and unusual, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb facs="tcp:95877:12"/>
they cannot be forced, as I said in the beginning,
into any tolerable, and proportionable decence. Yet
even those, who thus judg of the Letter, reduce the
whole according to the Allegory, to Christ and his
Church, and the sacred Members of it joyntly, and
severally. Be the immediate occasion therefore of
its writing what it may, the <hi>Jews</hi> are very earnest,
as they have been from the beginning, to have it
meant of their Synagogue only, the Modern among
our selves, of the Christian Church, exclusive whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and both so dress it up with Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories
(for scarce will they permit a Word, or Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,
to be sure not a Description of the Time, or
Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to pass without half a score at least) that
according to the Poet,
<q>
                  <l>—Pars minima est ipsa Puella sui.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Without therefore determining its Sense Mystical
directly to this, or that, whether private, or more
communicative Interpretation, I have in my Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
left it, at least endeavoured to leave it, as I
found it, and even in those places, where I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the greatest Liberty, have not gone far from the
literal Sence, not at all from that, which approached
nearest it, in the Judgment of the most sober Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators.
Such an one I look upon the learned
<hi>Jo. Mercerus</hi> to be, whom, when I found it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to consult the Opinions of others, I chiefly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and by whose pious and elaborate Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="tcp:95877:13"/>
if any shall take the pains to compare my <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrase</hi>
(the mistakes of the Printer being amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which are in some place through my absence du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole Impression very gross) the greatest
difficulties of Sense, or Expressions, may very easily
be resolved. He will moreover find upon Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that if he be content soberly to Allegorize, I
have left him as much scope to exercise his Religious
Invention that way, (tho it were to be wisht that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
had not prevail'd too much with otherwise
Grave and Religious Expositors) as he can well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and have only debarr'd him an indeterminate,
and almost infinite Extravagance.</p>
            <p>The Rhythms I have purposely design'd various,
not going always in the same Tract, lest instead of
raising the devout Souls Meditations, I should clap
Weights on them; and create in him a loathing of
the most exquisite Delicacies, by the same one kind
of ill dressing. A meer Verbal Translation, with
some heavy Cadences only, I have studiously avoided,
because I would not incur the same Fault, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
whether justly or no, I submit to my Judges
to decide, I am too apt to blame in others; and,
where ever occasion was offered, have enlarged upon
an Hint given, or Description, as they fell in my
way, further it may be than will be ordinarily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
me; defending my self all along by the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
of Faith, Decence, and Proportion, which I
have endeavoured to retain. In two or three places
I ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e used a kind of Measure, which may possibly
<pb facs="tcp:95877:13"/>
seem to those, who either take not time to judg of the
occasion, or will not allow it, too light for the subject
in hand, because less usual; tho I only follow therein the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Poets, whose metrical Foot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
not always of Dissyllables, by <hi>Sponde, Troche,</hi>
or <hi>Iambic,</hi> as ours, the <hi>French, Spanish,</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
correctly does, but more frequently of Trissyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables,
and sometimes of four Syllables intermixt, of
various and enterchanged quantities, as is seen espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the <hi>Drama, Ode,</hi> and <hi>Epode,</hi> and the
kinds of Verse wherein they are treated; tho no
kind of Verse amongst them is without the intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a several sort of Foot, and the most ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
the Hexameter, as it is call'd, tho it is the
greatest, and the most majestic, has the <hi>Dactyl</hi> and
<hi>Sponde,</hi> that is the Dissyllable of two long, and the
Trissyllable, of a long and two short so necessary,
that without both the Verse and Music cannot subsist,
yet was never thence accused of Levity. If it be
answered, that we in the Modern Languages have
Rhythm, or a coincidence of Sound in a single Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
to compensate for the disuse, (rather than
want) of the Trissyllable Foot; I think this is not
always sufficient, and the Criticks in Verse are too
severe, who would thus altogether restrain, and bind
up us Rhythmers, damning the Trissyllable Foot,
and cadence of Sound in the two last Syllables to the
<hi>Burlesque</hi> only, as the principal of its Characters;
tho why it should be so, if the Matter be otherwise
noble, and becoming, for my part I see no great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb facs="tcp:95877:14"/>
nor why the number of a Verse should be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
light, and wanton, for an allowable variety only,
when the Subject so requires, if the Language be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of it, as it must be on all hands confest the
<hi>English</hi> is. The <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Poets, as I
said, admitted as the great Character of Verse, and
its numerousness, this Variety; both because their
Language naturally required it, and because they
were perfect strangers to Rhythm, (the <hi>Greeks</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
till grown perfectly Barbarous, and the <hi>Latines</hi>
till after the Irruption of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi>
their Language became confined to the Cloyster, and
durst not appear walking delicately in Verse, but
with that chain of Servitude, its Conquerors had
thrown upon it). Our Language a Medly of all
the Barbarous Tongues, into which the noble <hi>Roman</hi>
was humbled, but partaking most of that which
most humbled it, beside roughnesses of its own, has
notwithstanding been so refin'd (as we flatter our
selves) that it will bear Foot, and Quantity, as
the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> did, but that Rhythm has
in a manner so thrust them out, that contenting, or
rather valuing it self (for the greatness of Sense and
Conceipt whereof, it is indeed capable, equal with any
of the now living, or long since dead Languages that
are, or in any Age were spoken in the World,) upon
the Dissyllable Foot, whether it be <hi>Sponde,</hi> or <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,</hi>
but chiefly <hi>Iambic,</hi> instead of all other Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities,
it thinks it self in single Cadence, a greater
Prince of Verse, than either <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Athens</hi> ever
were in all their admired Variety: And indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
<pb facs="tcp:95877:14"/>
this, as the Laws of Verse now stand with us,
tho we have Quantity, yet so uncertain is it in the
same Syllable, and so easie to be made, and used long
or short, (except in words of more Syllables than
two, translated from another Language, and some
few Dissyllables in our own, which are so unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as to their Quantity, that they either cannot
change it without alteration of their sense, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be used in Verse but in such certain places accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Proportion and Accent) and so great is
the number of Monosyllables, which may be either
long or short, as to their use, what ever they are as
to their nature, and by position, that making our
Metrical Foot to consist, as we mostly do, but of two
Syllables, it is very hard in <hi>English,</hi> to compose a
Period, but part of it, whether we will or no, shall
as to the number be Verse. Tho therefore Blank
Verse, as we call it, that is number Metrical (as they
would have it) without Rhythm, considering the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
fitness, and customary tendence of our Language,
may do excellently in the <hi>Drama,</hi> because it comes
nearest the ordinary way of Speech, wherein the
Interloqutors are supposed to converse (and indeed
to use Rhythm, or chiming Cadence there, to me
seems at least impertinent, if not at best forced, and
a strain beyond decence, such as has nothing of the
<hi>Verisimile</hi> in it) yet in an Epick Poem, to mention
no other, I know not how with us it can be well main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.
For it wants the proper and particular
Character, which we assign Verse, Rhythm I mean,
<pb facs="tcp:95877:15"/>
and were it written as Prose usually is, in its just
Periods, would both be read, and be, as indeed it
is, no other than Poetical Prose; that is, Masculine
Prose, drest up like <hi>Hercules</hi> by <hi>Omphale,</hi> in the
attire of one of her Women, but whose Shape and
Warlike Limbs, could not be concealed by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise.
Take an Instance of it from that most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and divinely flowing Speech of our first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in the fourth Book of Mr. <hi>Miltons Paradise
Lost,</hi> than which neither himself ever said any thing
softer, and more Poetical, nor can almost be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
to be said of Man.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To whom thus <hi>Eve</hi> reply'd; O Thou

when from sleep I first awak't, and
found my self repos'd under a Shade, on Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
much wondring where, and what I was,
whence thither brought, and how. Not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
far from thence, a murmuring sound of
Waters issu'd from a Cave, and spread into a
liquid Plain, then stood unmoved, pure as the
Expanse of Heaven. I thither went, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienc'd
thought, and laid me down on
the Green Bank, to look into the cleer smooth
Lake, that to me seem'd another Skie. As I
bent down to look, just opposite a Shape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the watry Gleam appear'd, bending to look
on me. I started back, it started back, but
pleas'd I soon return'd, pleas'd it return'd as
<pb facs="tcp:95877:15"/>
soon, with answering looks of Sympathy and
Love. There I had sixt mine Eyes till now, and
pine'd with vain desire, had not a Voice thus
warn'd me, What thou seest, what there thou
seest, Fair Creature, is thy Self, with Thee it
came, and goes; but follow me, and I will

which Prose commonly renders, would make it su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected,
that the Writer was in a Poetical Rapture;
but still, through the Disguise, the Prose appears, or
rather cannot be hid, any more than the Verse, in
the following Period; as I ghess of the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,

I shall write it in Blank Verse, and without adding,
or diminishing, or transposing a word, only making
the Verse sometime longer, sometime shorter, as in
the <hi>Pindaric,</hi> whether fitly so called I inquire not
here, leave it to the Reader to judg, whether there is

            <p>Where every Verse, like our Heroic in <hi>English,</hi>
has five Feet, with a solitary Syllable in the last
liquescing, and of very moderate sound, but whose
<hi>Penultima</hi> is ever to be pronounced, with Accent,
more strong; for they are to be scann'd as we call it
at School, (where we are first taught to make Verse
a little it may be of the soonest) just as in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
pure <hi>lambic,</hi> or as in the <hi>Dimetrum,</hi> or <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narium,</hi>
allowing never above two Syllables to a
Foot, but with continual Observation, contrary to
us, and which yet is not ever by them strictly noted,
not only of the <hi>Synalaepha,</hi> which melts down the
last Vowel of the former word into the first Syllable
of that which next follows, beginning with a Vowel,
and giving it its sound, but of the <hi>Synaeresis</hi> in the
same word, contracting two Syllables, be they Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
or Diphthongs, into one, except in some few Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regulars
according to the marks of both Feet, and
Contraction pointed out in the first Verse. Vpon
the solitary Syllable, and that which precedes it in
the last Foot, rests the Sound, or Chime, and which
in the <hi>Italian</hi> Language, if to this Character of Verse
they think fit to add Rhythm, is but necessary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that the Terminations of almost all perfect
words, except some few Particles, end in a Vowel.

            <p>So that, tho there be no Rhythms, the number is
purely metrical (if the Language also be not so too,
both by the turn of the words used, and the manner
of their use, by frequenter <hi>Apocopes</hi> than would be
tolerated in Prose) and cannot but be owned for
such. For were the Blank Verses above recited,
<pb facs="tcp:95877:18"/>
written as Prose, in their just Periods, for those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Reasons, and by the Marks given, they would
be so easily distinguished from it, that any one, who
is very little experienced in the <hi>Italian</hi> Language and
Poetry, tho there be no Rhythms, would presently
pronounce them, and very safely and confidently
might, to be excellent Verse. A thing, which I think<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Feet and Measure, which if it want, as the Verse is
thereby depriv'd of its greatest and best, and only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
Ornaments, the mind also that came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
to tempt its Charms, and expected them, langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
under the disappointment. This therefore, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it was, which made the <hi>Italians</hi> when they omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Rhythms, still to retain that kind of Number in
their Blank Verse, which should make it diverse from
Prose; and them the <hi>Spanish</hi> follow, in their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical
Compositions, both which with Rhythms, and
without, having most frequently a solitary and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerary
Syllable either in, or for the last Foot. The
<hi>French,</hi> as nearer us in <hi>Clime</hi> and Manners, come
nearer us too in their model of Verse, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
much after the same Method; only herein I
think they have the advantage, that considering
more seriously, the nature of Verse, and of their
Language, never that I know of, have they received the
Blank into the <hi>Epope,</hi> or indeed any kind of Poem.
Nay, so great admirers are they of Rhythm, (tho whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have been so long, I leave it to be enquired)
that they cannot abstain from it in the <hi>Drama,</hi> the
very Farce rarely excepted; and these have, of late at
least, been our great Law-givers, for Affairs of the
Stage, (how properly, it is no business of mine, any
where, especially in this place, to dispute); but never
yet have they been able to prevail with us to admit so
frequently, as their best Poets use it, the Dissyllable
Rhythm, or Cadence; tho since it is in so great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with them, and makes so necessary a part of
Verse with the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> when they use
<pb facs="tcp:95877:19"/>
Rhythm, that it is else lookt upon as less perfect, and
irregular, I know no reason, why if the Argument
be otherwise answerable, and great, we should hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it to the <hi>Burlesque,</hi> or <hi>Ridicule</hi> only, and give ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that, or the Trissyllable Foot none, or the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
place in serious Compositions. If therefore Our
selves, or the <hi>French</hi> will use Blank Verse, either in
an Heroick Poem, where they should be I think Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plets,
as in Mr. <hi>Cowley's Davideis,</hi> (for the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drains
of Sir <hi>William Davenant,</hi> and the Stanza
of Nine in <hi>Spensers Faery Queen,</hi> which are but
an Improvement of the <hi>Ottava Rima,</hi> to instance
in no more, seem not to me so proper) or in an Ode
or Sonnet, (which remains yet to be attempted) since
we want that Character of Verse, which the <hi>Greek</hi>
and the <hi>Latine</hi> had of old, and those among the
Modern equivalently observe, who both lie nearer
<hi>Rome,</hi> and retain the most visible Traces of its Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
having no means of differencing it from Prose
except by the Rhythm, as the most essential Mark,
let us give it the Character, as to its Form, which
it anciently had, a Number and Movement metrical,
with enterchang'd variety, according to the kind of
our Verse, of diverse sorts of Feet. But this we in
<hi>English</hi> have found, by the Experience of Sir <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip
Sidney, Ab. France,</hi> and others in the last Age,
would never do; and in the next, even Our now
cry'd-up Blank Verse, will look as unfashionable, how
well soever as a Novelty, and upon his Credit, who
was the Inventer of it here, it may speed in this. Not
but that I have, and always had, as great an honour for
<pb facs="tcp:95877:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Mr. <hi>Milton's Paradise Lost,</hi> as those who admire,
him most, and look upon it as Mr. <hi>Driden</hi> has very
well observed, <q>
                  <hi>To be one of the greatest, most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and most sublime Poems, take it altogether,
which either this Age, or Nation has produced.</hi>
               </q>
Nay, that it shall live as long as there are Men left in
our <hi>English</hi> World to read, and understand it; and
that many Ages hence translated into what-ever speech
we shall be then changed (for changing we have
been from <hi>Chaucer's</hi> time downward with a Witness,
however it be call'd Refining) that shall survive the
Language, wherein it stands written, and therein
it self. Yet still I say, the Learned only must and shall
be Judges of this, and that if he had thought to give
it the Adornments of Rhythm, and not avoided them
so Religiously, as any one may perceive he now and then
does, to the debasing of his great Sense, it had been so
absolute a piece,* that in spight of whatever the World
Heathen, or Christian hitherto has seen, it must have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
as the standard to all succeeding Poets &amp; Poesy.</p>
            <p>I beg my Readers pardon for this very long Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
which has swell'd much beyond the limits I
intended it, tho I hope not without giving him some
Diversion. For it is, I confess, beside my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and if I have taken wrong measures of Verse,
and Versifying, (the Standart of Verse being possibly
of late altered) I submit my private Fancy, and all
I have said here, to its great Judges and Masters,
for I only thought to have defended my self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those, who should object Lightness in a place or
two to the manner of my Verse, because, as I said
<pb facs="tcp:95877:20"/>
above, 'tis only unusual amongst us. For light it
cannot justly be thought by the most rigid, and scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
so long as the Argument continues the same;
nor will it, I am assur'd, be judg'd so by those, who
know what are the transports of the noblest Passion,
but then especially, when the pious Soul, rapt beyond
it self, falls into an extasie of Divine Love. No
wonder in such Circumstances, if its Speech and
manner of Expression be also Exstatical. The rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of my Verse now and then seems rather to be
obnoxious to a <hi>Reprimende,</hi> and possibly it may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it, but I much willinger chose to be deficient in
the Tuneableness of my Rhythms, than have the
Sense broken and perplext.</p>
            <p>I think I need not take any notice of the several
Titles which I have given each Chapter; for the
Song being of all Expositors acknowledged, as to its
general Form, to be <hi>Dramatic,</hi> because of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Interlocutors, which are introduced (tho consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as an <hi>Epithalamium</hi> for its great Argument,
consisting of many Odes, it has more of the <hi>Lyric,</hi>
whereupon the speeches being not so directly continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor short, and in Repartee, as they say, each to
other, as in the <hi>Drama,</hi> I have taken occasion to put
it mostly in the <hi>Lyric</hi> dress) I could not do as I
thought any thing more proper. However, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all manner of Offence that may be taken, I
will uncompelled account for it to the Ingenuous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
in as few words as I can. Supposing therefore,
which I think none will deny, that it is, as I said, a
<hi>Drama,</hi> the Persons speaking may well be allowed to
<pb facs="tcp:95877:20"/>
be, as following the best Expositors I have fixt them,
<hi>The Spouse,</hi> and <hi>Her Beloved,</hi> with the <hi>Friends</hi>
on either side in the <hi>Chorus,</hi> tho, who, according to
the Mystery, by these are signified, further than brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
toucht before, I leave to them to interpret. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of a <hi>Prologue,</hi> I have called the Stanzas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
preceding the Hymn it self <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centio,</hi>
or <hi>Praeludium,</hi> tho if I had call'd them the
Prologue, since they serve to the same end as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
in the <hi>Drama,</hi> I see no inconvenience, nor any
whom the name can offend, save the Ignorant. That
which I have design'd instead of the <hi>Epilogue,</hi> I have
I think by the most regular name, rather called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
than <hi>Epilogus.</hi> For the Song it self sounding as
to the letter nothing but Love, and tho intended by
the sacred Penman to be meant of the Divine Love
only, too apt to be distorted to that which is sensual,
carnal and brutish, through the Pravity of our Nature,
even untranslated into Metre, and as it lies in the
Text, the <hi>Epode</hi> serves according to the true sense
of its name, <hi>Carmen ad amoliendum quicquid,
noxium est,</hi> to remove the Vail, and to take away
all occasion of perverting the sublime Mysteries. The
<hi>Legend</hi> further <hi>of Love</hi> I have stiled it, for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
sake to the great <hi>Spenser,</hi> whose Stanza of Nine
I have used, and who has Intituled the six Books
which we have compleat of his <hi>Faery Queen,</hi> by the
several Legends of <hi>Holiness, Temperance, Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Friendship, Justice, and Courtesy,</hi> and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
who knows what the word Legend there, or in its
true and first notion signifies, it will neither seem
<pb facs="tcp:95877:21"/>
strange, ridiculous, or improper: I have made it
to consist of three <hi>Cantos,</hi> agreeable enough to the
nature of an <hi>Epode,</hi> or <hi>Legend,</hi> if it be judged
indecent, as indeed it is, considering its length,
for an <hi>Epilogue;</hi> In the first whereof taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from the <hi>Canticles,</hi> to which in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it refers, I have endeavoured to shew the <hi>true
Nature of Love,</hi> and what it was <hi>in the state of
Innocence,</hi> describing it by the liveliest Images,
which I could form to my self suitable to a Poetical
Composition. In the second I have considered the
thing, whatever it be, <hi>vulgarly called Love,</hi>
under the dominion and government of <hi>Sense,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive
of <hi>Reason,</hi> which it too often either draws
to its party, or wholly extinguishes, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be conceived more absurd, unreasonable,
extravagant, and inhumane. The third <hi>Canto,</hi>
in the close of it, is design'd for the <hi>Restauration
of Love,</hi> by <hi>Sacred Marriage,</hi> or <hi>Wedlock,</hi>
according to the Divine Institutiin, to its ancient
Dignity and Lustre; The very cause, amongst
others there-under adumbrated, for which <hi>Salomon,</hi>
divinely inspired, wrote this Song, which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
thereunto by so noble an Instance, that
they only betray their Impiety, or Atheism, who in
an Age so Wise and Critically Rational, as this
would be thought, can find no more becoming occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w and vend their Wit, than what is
made by exposing tbe sublimest Mysteries of Our
Religion, and the most glorious displays of Our
<pb facs="tcp:95877:21"/>
both present and future Happiness. If therefore
any, who are able to judg, shall chance to find there,
or in any of my Compositions, the least Word, or
Sentence, which may choque them, or escape me,
not agreeable to the sentiments of this <hi>Best of
Churches,</hi> and <hi>Good Manners,</hi> I hereby utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disclaim it, and beseech them to give the place
a double thrust, for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eir own Revenge, and mine,
who would not have put them to the trouble, had
my self perceived it. There is more of it a great
deal, than at first was intended, but, I know not
how, it grew so strangely under my hands, that I
have been forced to lay aside more thoughts, than I
have been at the pains to dress up, to reduce it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the present Compass. However, I hope, it is
in all parts consonant to <hi>sound Doctrine,</hi> whose
limits, for tbe greatest glories of Verse, I would
not willingly transgress. As to the Song it self
following the Division, or Partition of it, which
the Church allows in the distinction of Chapters, I
have called the first <hi>Divini Amoris Ecstasis,</hi> or
<hi>Protasis,</hi> tho it may be by the latter Title not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so naturally. But seeing visibly in the Song all
the other parts which are by the Ancients assign'd the
<hi>Drama,</hi> (who it may be hence first of all took their
Rules) I fixt the <hi>Protasis</hi> here as in the usual place,
and more designedly, because in this and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chapter, we have as it were the sum of the whole
laid down, and the mind kept in suspence for the
<pb facs="tcp:95877:22"/>
event, which was the business, as is known by the
learned, of the <hi>Protasis.</hi> The next great part of the
<hi>Drama</hi> was the <hi>Epitasis,</hi> or the counterturn, as I may
call it, of Action, which I have placed in the third
Chapter, under the title of <hi>Dolor de Absentia
Sponsi, seu Epitasis,</hi> (tho this latter in the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off the sheet is omitted, and with another escape
or two consequent thereof, has given me the trouble
of advising the Reader of it here, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
the mistake) where, as in the <hi>Epitasis exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur
turbae, &amp; caligine quâdam res involvun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
We find the Spouse all Joy before, Mourning for
the absence of her Beloved, and all things for a while
seem to incline to the worst. The <hi>Catastasis</hi> before
its time in the printed Copy, is intituled to the fourth
Partition, but belongs rightly to the fifth Chapter, or
Division (where I have also caused it, as soon as
by seeing the sheets, I perceived the Error of the
Press again to be set, desiring the Reader, instead
of that Title in the fourth Chapter, to put <hi>Deside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium)</hi>
successive of the <hi>Epitasis</hi> in the third. And
it is a continuance of the Spouses trouble for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of her Lord there first hinted; and whereas in
the <hi>Epitasis, eadem cernitur rerum perturbatio,</hi>
but somewhat greater, and opens the way to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all in the following Partitions under their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Titles, till the <hi>Drama</hi> comes to its last Period
in the <hi>Catastrophe,</hi> which I have placed at the eighth
Partition, tho if any one will, he may make the
<hi>Catastrophe</hi> begin at the seventh, and in the eighth
bring the Spouse <hi>ad Sponsi fores,</hi> after the Jewish
<pb facs="tcp:95877:22"/>
Custom, in pursuance and complement of it; That
which is signified by the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> in the <hi>Drama,</hi>
being the conclusion of the whole, according to its
expected or unlookt-for event. I might add here a
great deal concerning the <hi>Unity of Action,</hi> strictly
observed in this Hymn, and the <hi>Chorus,</hi> which is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where regular, but I pass them both over. With
respect to what I have already laid down, I will not
say that <hi>Salomon</hi> design'd all, or any of these parts
in this Divine Song, or in the manner that I, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ancients, have bounded them; but this I dare
say, that whosoever knows the Motions of the Pious
Soul in its love to God, knows also that these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts make it up, which I shall endeavour thus
briefly to evidence, and appeal to those who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it best, and have try'd the great experiment.</p>
            <p>No sooner therefore by the Preaching of the Gospel,
and the most benign Operations of the good Spirit of
God, comes the devout Soul, to be convinced of the
Divine Love, in it self and infinite Perfections how
beyond expression amiable, to the Soul by ten thousand
Experiences how indeared, but being first loved, and
knowing assuredly it self to be loved, it endeavours
according to its unequal measure to return love for
love; Is all as it were on a flame towards its Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and thinks nothing comparative with him Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
nothing for his sake too hard or grievous to be
undertaken. The World to such an One and all its
gaudy Pageantry appears, as it truly is, a dead and
lifeless and accursed thing; without any Charms except
to betray and ensnare, and with Pleasures (such as
<pb facs="tcp:95877:23"/>
they are) which continue but for a moment, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in the using; nor can it find any relish or satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
but in the enjoyment of those Real and Eternal
Beauties, on which Time and Age have no effect, and
whose most frequent use encrease only, and heighten
their delight. Of these it continually thinks,
loves and admires none but these; and is so wholly
transformed into what it loves, that it is no more it
self, nor lives any other Life than what that inspires.
Or in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> phrase, <hi>Being Crucified with
Christ, nevertheless it lives, or Christ rather lives
in it, and the Life which it lives in the Flesh, it
lives by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved
it, and gave himself for it.</hi> In this Extasy, while
it continues, the Pious Soul once enflamed with the
Love of God, exults with joy unspeakable; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the Extasy will, till either Our love by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
as is not unusual (the more wretched We) grow
cold in its once most ardent pursuits, or the violence
of a Temptation intervene, or the most Highest, for
either the punishment of our Remissness, or trial of
our Sincerity, for a while withdraw himself; but
then, the happier we once to perceive and take notice of
it, how is the Soul that truly loves, perplext? This way
it runs, and that; and only thoughtful of its Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and what it would find, where yet to find it
knows not. Here comes in the true <hi>Epitasis:</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
face of things appears than was wont, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Hymns, and joyous Acclamations, which
used before to be its constant Companions, nothing is
heard, in all its Retreats, but the Sighs and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:95877:23"/>
as of one forsaken. The Soul is overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
almost with <hi>Sorrow,</hi> which to prove the most In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense,
Hearty, and Sincere, it endeavours all it can,
to <hi>clear its Innocence,</hi> calling Heaven and God to
witness it; of yet which, having paused a while and
not daring in cooler Blood to be too confident, it
reflects upon its former coldness and negligence, and
resolves on greater <hi>Care</hi> and Circumspection for the
future, is <hi>angry</hi> with it self, and <hi>afraid,</hi> and
mourns bitterly, and begs but once more to be try'd,
and professes its <hi>Zeal,</hi> and passes ten thousand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
binding them with as many Vows, and resolves
so throughly to be <hi>revenged</hi> of it self, that it will
never give over its unweary search, till it has found
its Beloved. Away in this heat it flies out of it self as
it were, and seeks, and asks after him of all it meets;
and tho affronted frequently by the way, bears the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity
with patience, and feels the smart of no
Wound received in the inquiry, comparable to his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
till almost quite tired, now and again, and
the third time (and it were well if but the three
hundredth time the <hi>Epitasis</hi> and the <hi>Catastasis</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of it recurr'd). Lo! he whom the Soul loves,
and who infinitely more loves the Soul, taking pity
of its Labours, and approving its Integrity, at length
discovers himself a-new, with greater Attractives
than before. And now all is perfectly well again.
Peace and Joy, and the tender endearments of a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Affection blown up to a Flame, which no Waters
can quench, sparkle in both. No Discourse passes,
but of the constancy of each others Love, its Charms
<pb facs="tcp:95877:24"/>
how great, its Renewals how surprizing. The happy
Nuptials, which make the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> seem not to
be far off, and by Faith through the Vail the Soul
looks, and sees the Preparations, and hastens the
time by its calls, and even dies with Impatience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is but a moment deferr'd.</p>
            <p>This is the Progress of Divine Love in the holy
Soul, adumbrated as I conceive, in this Mysterious
Song, but so coldly and imperfectly displayed by me
(God help poor Mortals!) that suspected thence,
as I fear for my self I justly may, never to have been
really touched with it, I can only appeal to Him, who
searches the Heart, with the most earnest Obtestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that if my Love to my Lord and Saviour be
not such as it ought, with a flame so pure, and great
as to warm, and enlighten others, according to the
Prerogative of my Office; it may yet be sufficient
to keep my self from either freezing, or stumbling;
especially from either thinking, or speaking any thing
unbecoming it, at least <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and in the too much despised Rank of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Poet.</p>
            <p>As for the other sacred Hymns, they seem to me
to be of those parts of Scripture concerning which I
may truly say, omitting their Divine Inspiration, that
being compared with the best and most Majestie of
<hi>Pindar,</hi> or <hi>Horace,</hi> they are so far from losing any
thing of their Beauty, that they only receive thence
the greater Lustre, and cast upon the noblest thoughts
of those next to Immortal Lyrics, whom the Heathen
World, and we above all the Heathen most deservedly
<pb facs="tcp:95877:24"/>
admire, the honourable Office of serving but as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Foyl, to make them appear the more Glorious.
For nothing can be conceived more Poetical, nothing
more Tuneful and Harmonious, nothing more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyrambic
and Ecstatical. Of this latter sort are
the Songs of <hi>Moses, Deborah,</hi> and <hi>Habakkuk.</hi>
And had I not a design of drawing to an end of this
long Preface, as soon as possible, I might instance in the
several Graces, which are proper to the rest, not as
turned by me, but as they lie in the Original; Of
which yet they are not wholly divested by the most
barbarous Translation, into any Language, and in
some of which, the <hi>Latine</hi> particularly of <hi>Castellio,</hi>
and the <hi>Italian</hi> of <hi>Diodati,</hi> not to say our own,
which may Vye with the best, they shine with a Ray
only second to what they receiv'd upon their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Inspiration.</p>
            <p>The Compositions, which are my own purely, or
Translated occasionally out of the Originals, noted
in the Titles or Margin, are of an infinite baser
Alloy; and all I dare presume to say for them, is;
That when I either made, or turned them, they suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
well enough my then present Temper; and I have
a kindness for them, proportionable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
they at that time gave my self, and have
since given my Friends, at whose request I did some
of them. However I had not been thus confident
to Print them now, and publickly own them in this
Habit, but that unknown to me, and unallowed,
after very false Copies some of them have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Published. I have here and there added the
<pb facs="tcp:95877:25"/>
Dates, not for Ostentation, any one may think,
but thereby to give some little account how I have been
wont to spend part of my Time, both before I was
admitted into Holy Orders, and since; and that if
some of my Rhythms may not so directly suit with
my present Circumstances, and seem too inflate with
the Muses imaginary Profits and Honours, and idle
Tattle to no purpose in the World; the time wherein I
did them, may be my Apology, as it has serv'd
others before me; tho there be none of them I hope,
which will not be allowed as a tolerable Diversion
for the severest Divine, their subject being either
Religious, or exemplary Moral. And I am not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to profess, that wearied with more abstruse studies,
I have been wont in a Country Village barren of other
Diversions thus to unbend, and refresh my self. I might
amongst the rest have added the Muses Complaint, but
beside that I thank God I have no great need, being
content with my Fortune, I never yet found any good
come of it, and Mr. <hi>Cowley's,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Spenser's</hi>
before him, will indifferently serve for any of the
Trade, and he values himself too highly who dares
expect better fortune than they met. My change of
Habit, I acknowledg, and manner of Living, with
encrease of Years, have much taken me off from
these kind of Delights, tho had I no greater loss of
time at last to repent, than what has been spent
among the Muses, I should, in my own Opinion at
least, be a very happy Man. Nay, I am so far at
present from repenting it, for the main, that as the
late Cardinal <hi>Palavicino,</hi> on the like occasion says,
<pb facs="tcp:95877:25"/>
               <hi>Giovommi, che in eta, &amp; in professione più
libera, Io sopra modo fui vago d'alcuni autori, la
cui frequente lezione sarebbe ora poco dicevole,
alla maturita de miei anni, ed alla serjetà del mio
stato; si che me è auvenuto, come a coloro, i
quali con più animoso, che sicuro consiglio pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticarono
lungamente fra gli aliti pericolosi delle
sotterranee miniere, che uscendone salvi, hannosi
comperata, con questo rischio, qualche più inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na

kind, I have been at the pains to rehearse (and I
might have added many more) in the Ode, called
the <hi>Voyage,</hi> others I have glanced at in the Odes
of <hi>Petrarch,</hi> reducing as far as was convenient that
excellent Poets sense, to my own Condition.</p>
            <p>And now, having in the body of this Preface
troubled my Reader with a particular defence of
<hi>Rhythm,</hi> as the most natural, and proper Character
of Verse, in the Modern, and it may be in all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
that are or ever were spoken in the World,
(the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> only excepted) and without
which, especially in <hi>English,</hi> it cannot appear distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from Prose; (and which, if we look either
to the first Original of <hi>Rhythm,</hi> is so far from
being the Invention of a late Barbarous Age, or
People, that it was known, as is judged by the
Learned, and allow'd by the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and <hi>Eastern</hi>
Nations, long before the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi>

Prose, whose Character is <hi>Rhythm</hi> or Cadence, seems
to be in all Countries the direction of pure Nature,
uncultivated by Art; and) that I may not in Act
condemn, what I have in Word taken upon me the
confidence to defend, I have stiled the whole Second
Part by the fittest, as I think, of the most Ancient,
as well as Modern names, <hi>RIMES.</hi> I confess I have
consulted none of my Friends in it, nor know I whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they, and the Censors of <hi>English</hi> Verse will allow
it me, tho <hi>Casa,</hi> and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

purely hence, and upon their Authority barely have I
staid my self, but from a principle of Modesty, if my
Reader dare credit me, that I may neither forestal and
deceive him, nor usurp for such occasional Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
an Honour and Title which belongs not to them.
The noble Title of <hi>Poems</hi> I mean, too great a bearing
for so mean an estate of Verse as that to which of the
most they are vulgarly affixt. If others are of another
