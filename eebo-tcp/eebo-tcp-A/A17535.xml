         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

wherto men might in such cases
haue a recourse &amp; present refuge at all

vsed and dyd geue abrode to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
&amp; further appoynted in my self
to fulfill (for so much as laye in me) the

the time to come. The whiche the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to execute and brynge to passe, I
spared not to go to all those that sente

the cases and circumstaunces of

certein yeres beyng at cambrige, I
of the age of .xx. yeres, partly for mine
exercise and profe what I coulde do,
but chefely for certein of my very fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
dyd translate out of Latine into
Englishe certein workes, hauyng no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
els so good to gratifie theim
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Wherof one. of <hi>S. Chrysostome de
modo orandi deum,</hi> that is, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:5120:4"/>
to praye to god, I sent to one my
frende then beyng in the courte. One
other, a woorke <hi>of Erasmus de vera
theologia,</hi> the true and redy waye to
reade the scripture, I dyd geue to
maister Augustine Stiwarde Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Norwiche, not in the ful as the
authore made it, but abbreuiate for his
only purpose to whome I sent it, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng
out many subtile thinges, made
rather for great &amp; learned diuines, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for others. The thirde was the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
of the same Erasmus vpon the
Epistle of. S. Iude, whiche I trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
at the requeste of one other my
deare frende.</p>
            <p>These I did in Englishe the rather
because at that tyme men ware not so
geuen all to Englishe, but that they
dyd fauoure &amp; mayteine good learning
conteined in tongues &amp; sciences, and
did also study and apply diligently the
same the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues. Therfore I thought
no hurte done. Sence y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tyme diuerse
other thynges I haue written, but
with entente neuer more to write in
<pb facs="tcp:5120:5"/>
the Englishe tongue, partly because
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of that which is so writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
passeth not the compasse of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,
but remaineth enclosed within
the seas, and partly because I thought
that labours so taken should be halfe
loste among them whiche sette not by
learnyng. Thirdly for that I thought
it beste to auoide the iudgement of the
multitude, from whome in maters of
learnyng a man shalbe forced to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente,
in disprouyng that whiche they
most approue, &amp; approuyng that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

that the common settyng furthe and
printi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of euery foolishe thyng in eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe,
both of phisicke vnperfectly, and
other matters vndiscretly, diminishe
the grace of thynges learned set furth
in the same. But chiefely, because I
wolde geue noue example or comforte
to my countrie men, (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I wolde to
be now, as here tofore they haue bene,
comparable in learnyng to men of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
countries) to stonde onely in the

simplicite of thesame, and to procede

bothe in tongues and sciences at

Bishoppe of Norwiche, because the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
maister Framyngham loued hym

aboue others. He after my departure
deliuered the bokes to the reuerende
father in god Iho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Skippe, late bishop
of Hereforde, then to. D. Thixtle, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

secretarie after to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynges Maiestie,
all great learned men. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
they wente, among whome the
bokes died, (as I suppose,) or els be
closely kept, that after my death they
may be setfurthe in the names of them
which now haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as their workes.
Howe soeuer it be, wel I knowe that
at my returne out of Italie (after .vj.
yeres continuance ther) into Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
I coulde neuer vnderstand wher they
wer, although I bothe diligently and
desirousely sought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. After these I
translated out of Greke into Latine a
litle boke of <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> declarynge
howe a man maye in praiynge confesse

for his tyme, of great expectacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That
done I beganne a chronicle of the citie
of Norwiche, of the beginninge therof

The matere wherof yet rude and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested

I minde to polishe, and to make an

shorte, in phisicke diuerse thynges I
haue made &amp; settefurth in print bothe
in Greke and Latine, not mindyng to
do other wise, as I haue before said, al
my life: For which cause al these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
I haue rehersed, els superstuous
in this place. Yet see, meaning now to
counseill a litle agaynst the sweatyng
sickenes for helpe also of others, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandyng
my former purpose, two
thynges compell me, in writynge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to returne agayne to Englishe,
Necessite of the matter, &amp; good wyl to
my countrie, frendes, &amp; acquaintance,
whiche here to haue required me, to
whome I thinke my selfe borne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5120:8"/>Necessite, for that this disease is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moste
peculiar vnto vs Englishe men,
and not common to all men, folowyng
vs, as the shadowe the body, in all
countries, albeit not at al times. Ther
fore compelled I am to vse this our
Englishe tongue as best to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande,
and moste nedeful to whome it
most foloweth, most behoueth to haue
spedy remedie, and often tymes leaste
nyghe to places of succourre and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte
at lerned mennes handes: and
leaste nedefull to be setfurthe in other
tongues to be vnderstand generally of
all persons, whome it either haunteth
not at all, or els very seldome, as ones
in an age. Thinkynge it also better to
write this in Englishe after mine own
meanyng, then to haue it translated
out of my Latine by other after their
misunderstandyng.</p>
            <p>Good wyll to my countrie frendes
and acquaintance, seynge them wyth
out defence yelde vnto it, and it fere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to inuade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, furiousely handle
them, spedily oppresse them, vnmercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:5120:8"/>
choke them, and that in no small
numbers, and such persons so notably
noble in birthe, goodly conditions,
graue sobrietie, singular wisedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, and
great learnynge, as Henry Duke of
Suffolke, and the lorde Charles his
brother, as fewe hath bene sene lyke
of their age: an heuy &amp; pitiful thyng to
here or see. So that if by onely learned
men in phisicke &amp; not this waye also it
should be holpen, it were nedeful al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
halfe so many learned men to be
redy in euery toune and citie, as their
should be sweatynge sicke folkes. Yet
this notwithstandynge, I wyll euery
man not to refuse the counseill of the
present or nighe phisicen learned, who
maie, accordyng to the place, persone,
cause, &amp; other circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances, geue more
particular counseil at nede, but in any
wise exhorte him to seke it with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
To this enterprise also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
so many learned men, not a
litle stirreth me the gentilnes and
good willes of al sortes of men, which
I haue well proued heretofore
<pb facs="tcp:5120:9"/>
by my other former bokes. Mindynge
therefore with as good a will to geue
my counseil in this, and trusting for no
lesse gentlenes in the same, I wyll
plainly and in English for their better
vnderstandynge to whome I write,
firste declare the beginnynge, name,
nature, and signes of the sweatynge
sickenes. Next, the causes of the same.
And thirdly, how to preserue men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

in walles, out of Fraunce, and in the
firste yere of his reigne, ther chaunced
a disease among the people, lastyng the
reste of that monethe &amp; all september,
which for the soubdeine sharpenes and
vnwont cruelnes passed the pestilence.
For this commonly geueth .iv. or .iiij.

a sorowful Supper. As it founde them
so it toke them, some in sleape some in

some fasting &amp; some ful, some busy and
some idle, and in one house sometyme
three sometime fiue, sometyme seuen
sometyme eyght, sometyme more some

in euerye Towne escaped, it was
thoughte great fauour. How, or wyth
what maner it toke them, with what
grieffe, and accidentes it helde theym,
herafter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I wil declare, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I shal
come to shewe the signes therof. In
the mene space, know that this disease
(because it most did stand in sweating
from the beginning vntil the endyng)
was called here, the Sweating sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
and because it firste beganne in
Englande, it was named in other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untries,
<pb facs="tcp:5120:10"/>
the englishe sweat. Yet some
coniecture, that it, or the like, hath bene
before seene among the Grekes in the
siege of Troie. In the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour Octaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
warres at <hi>Cantabria,</hi> called nowe
Biscaie, in Hispaine: and in the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
at the Rhodes. How true that is,
let the aucthours loke: how true thys
is, the best of our Chronicles she with,
&amp; of the late begonne disease the freshe
memorie yet confirmeth. But if the
name wer now to be geuen, and at my
libertie to make the same: I would of
the maner and space of the disease (by
cause the same is no sweat only, as her
after I will declare, &amp; in the spirites)
make the name <hi>Ephemera,</hi> which is to
sai, a feuer of one natural dai. A feuer,
for the feruor or burning, drieth &amp; swe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ating
feure like. Of one naturall day,
for that it lasteth but the time of .xxiiij
houres. And for a distinction from
the commune <hi>Ephemera,</hi> that Galene
writeth of, comming both of other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uses,
and wyth vnlike paines, I wold
putte to it either Englishe, for that it

of oure Lorde GOD and the

king Edwarde the sixth, beginning at

proceadinge with greate mortalitie to

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:5120:11"/>
in Wales, then to Westchestre, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentre,
Oxenfoorde, and other tounes
in the Southe, and suche as were in

it came notablie the seuenth of

the losse of .vii.C.lxi. from the .ix. day
vntil the .xvi. daye, besides those that
died in the .vii. and .viii. dayes, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
no registre was kept, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it abated
vntil the .xxx. day of thesame, with the
losse of .C.xlii. more. Then ceassing
there, it wente from thence throughe
al the east partes of England into the
Northe vntill the ende of Auguste, at
whiche tyme it diminished, and in the
ende of Septembre fully ceassed.</p>
            <p>This disease is not a Sweat onely,
(as it is thought &amp; called) but a feuer.
as I saied, in the spirites by putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
venemous, with a fight, trauaile,
and laboure of nature againste the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
receyued in the spirites, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
by chaunce foloweth a Sweate,
or issueth an humour compelled by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as also chanceth in other sicknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb facs="tcp:5120:12"/>
whiche consiste in humours, when
they be in their state, and at the worste
in certein dayes iudicial, aswel by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,
bledinges, &amp; fluxes, as by swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.
That this is true, the self swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
do shewe. For as in vtter busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
bodies y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sore do labour, by trauail
of the same are forced to sweat, so in in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner
diseases, the bodies traueiled &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored
by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are moued to the like. In
which labors, if nature be stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; able
to thrust out the poiso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by sweat (not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
letted) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> escapeth: if not,
it dieth. That it is a feuer, thus I haue
partly declared, and more wil streight
by the notes of the disease, vnder one
shewing also by the same notes, signes,
and short tariance of the same, that it
consisteth in the spirites. First by the
peine in the backe, or shoulder, peine in
the extreme partes, as arme, or legge,
with a flusshing, or wind, as it semeth
to certeine of the pacientes, flieng in
the same. Secondly by the grief in
the liuer and the nigh stomacke. Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely,
by the peine in the head, &amp; madnes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:5120:12"/>
of the same. Fourthly by the passion
of the hart. For the flusshing or wynde
comming in the vtter and extreame
partes, is nothing els but the spirites
of those same gathered together, at the
first entring of the euell aire, agaynste
the infection therof, &amp; flyeng the same
from place to place, for their owne sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uegarde.
But at the last infected, they
make a grief where thei be forced, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly is in tharme or legge (the
fartheste partes of theire refuge) the
backe or shulder: trieng ther first a bru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
as good souldiers, before they wil let
their enemye come further into theire
dominion. The other grefes be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in thother partes aforsaid &amp; sorer,
because the spirites be there most ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
as in their founteines, whether
alwaies thinfection desireth to go. For
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the liuer, the nigh stomack, braine,
and harte, come all the .iij. sortes, and
kyndes of spirites, the gouernoures of
oure bodies, as firste spronge there.
But from the hart, the liuish spirites.
In putrifieng wherof by the euel aier
<pb facs="tcp:5120:13"/>
in bodies fit for it, the harte is oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Wherupon also foloweth a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous
heauinesse, (the fifthe token of
this disease,) and a desire to sleape, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
contented, the senses in al partes
beynge as they were bounde or closed
vp, the partes therfore left heuy, vnli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uishe,
and dulle. Laste foloweth the
shorte abidinge, a certeine Token of
the disease to be in the spirites, as wel
may be proued by the <hi>Ephemera</hi> that
Galene writethe of, whiche because it
consistethe in the Spirites, lasteth but
one natural day. For as fire in hardes
or straw, is sone in flambe &amp; sone oute,
euen so heate in the spirites, either by
simple distemperature, or by infection
and putrefaction therin conceyued, is
sone in flambe and sone out, and soner
for the vehemencye or greatues of the
same, whiche without lingering, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth
sone the light matter, contrary
to al other diseases restyng in humou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
wherin a fire ones kindeled, is not
so sone put out, no more then is the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
in moiste woodde, or fat Sea coles,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:5120:13"/>
as well by the particular Example of
the pestilence, (of al others most lyke
vnto this) may be declared, whyche by
that it sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in euel humors, tarieth
as I said, sometyme, from .iiij.vii.ix. &amp;
xj. vntill .xiij. dayes, differentlie from
this, by reason therof, albeit by infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
most lyke to this same. Thus
vnder one laboure shortelie I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
bothe what this disease is,
wherein it consisteth, howe and with
what accidentes it grieueth and is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferente
from the Pestilence, and the
propre signes, and tokens of the same,
without the whiche, if any do sweate,
I take theym not to Sweate by this
Sickenesse, but rather by feare, heate
of the yeare, many clothes, greate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
affection, excesse in diete, or at
the worst, by a smal cause of infection,
and lesse disposition of the bodi to this
sicknes. So that, insomoche as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was nat al voide of matter, sweate
it did when infection came: but in that
the mattere was not greate, the same
coulde neyther be perilous nor paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,

great mortalitie, in the yere .m.d.xxix.
Cause wherof none other there is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,

returne again i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to this world, he could
not saue these sortes of men, hauing so
moche sweatyng stuffe, so many euill
humoures laid vp in store, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasante,
feareful, &amp; pestilent disease:
except thei would learne a new lesson,
&amp; folowe a new trade. For other wise,
neither the auoidyng of this countrie
(the seconde reason) nor fleyng into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
(a commune refuge in other
diseases) wyll preserue vs Englishe
men, as in this laste sweate is by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
well proued in Cales, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twerpe,
and other places of Brabant,
wher only our contrimen ware sicke,
<pb facs="tcp:5120:18"/>
&amp; none others, except one or .ij. others
of thenglishe diete, which is also to be
noted. The cause hereof natural is
onely this, that they caried ouer with
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; by lyke diete ther incresed that
whiche was the cause of their disease.
Wherefore lette vs asserteine our
selues, that in what soeuer contrie
lyke cause and matter is, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
lyke aier and cause efficient, wil
make lyke effecte and disease in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
of agreable complexions, age, and
diete, if the tyme also doe serue to
these same, and in none others. These
I putte, for that the tyme of the yere
hote, makethe moche to the malice of
the disease, in openynge the pores of
the body, lettynge in the euill aier,
resoluynge the humores and makynge
them flowable, and disposing therfore
the spirites accordyngly, besyde,
that (as I shewed in the first cause of
this pestilente sweate) it stirreth and
braweth out of the erthe euill exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and mistes, to thinfection of the
aier and displeasure of vs. Diet I put,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:5120:18"/>
for that they of the contrarie diete be
not troubled with it at all. Age and
complexion, for this, that although it
spareth no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> age of bothe kyndes, nor no
complexion but some it touche the, yet
for the most parte (wherby rules and
reasones be alwayes to be made) it
vexed theim of the middle age, beste
luste, and theim not moch vnder that,
and of complexions hote &amp; moiste, as
fitteste by their naughty &amp; moche sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie
of blode to fede the spirites: or
nigh and lyke to the same in some one
of the qualities, as cholerike in hete,
phlegmatike in moister, excepte tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their qualities, as drinesse in cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerike,
&amp; cold in phlegmatike, by great
dominion ouer thother, did lette. For
the clene contrarie complerio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the
infected aier, alwaies remaine helth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
saulfe and better then tofore, the
corrupte and infected aier notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng.
Therfore cold and drie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones
either it touched not at all, or
very fewe, and that wyth no dangers
such I say as beside their complexion,
<pb facs="tcp:5120:19"/>
(whiche is so harde to finde in any
man exacte and simple, as exacte hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes)
were annoied with some corrupt
humoures &amp; spirites, &amp; therfore mete
by so moch to receiue it, &amp; that by good
reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For nothing can naturally haue
power to do ought against any thing,
excepte the same haue in it selfe a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posicion
by like qualities to receiue it.
As the cause in the fote ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not trouble
the flanke and leue the knee (the mean
betwixte) except there were a greater
consent and likenes of nature in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance
(whiche we call <hi>sympathian</hi>)
betwixte those then thother. Nor fire
refusynge stones, ca<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e burne hardes,
strawe, stickes and charcole, oile, waxe
fatte, and seacole, except these same
first of al wer apte, and by conuenient
qualities disposed to be enflamed and
burned. Nor any man goeth about to
burne water, because the qualities
thereof be contrary, and the body vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed
to the like of fire. By whiche
reason it may also be perceiued, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
venemouse qualitie of this corrupt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:5120:19"/>
is hote and moiste. for it redily enfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tethe
the lyke complexions, and those
nygh vnto theim, and the contrary not
at all, or hardly: &amp; easely doth putrify,
as doe the Southe wyndes. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
next vnto those colde and drie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions,
olde men escaped free, as
like to theim by age: and children, as
voide of replecion consumed by their
great hete, and therefore alwaies redy
to eate. But in this disease the subtile
humour euill and abundant in full
bodies fedyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirites, is more to be
noted then the humour complexional,
whiche notwithstanding, as an helper
or hinderer to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, is not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
For els it should be in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and persones indifferently, wher
all complexiones be. The thirde and
laste reason is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they which had thys
sweat sore with perille or death, were
either men of welthe, ease, &amp; welfare,
or of the poorer sorte such as wer idle
persones, good ale drinkers, and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
haunters. For these, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great
welfare of the one sorte, and large
<pb facs="tcp:5120:20"/>
drinkyng of thether, heped vp in their
bodies moche euill matter: by their
ease and idlenes, coulde not waste and
consume it. A comfirmacion of this is,
that the laborouse and thinne dieted
people, either had it not, because they
dyd eate but litle to make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
or with no greate grefe and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
because they laboured out moche
thereof. Wherefore vpon small cause,
necessarily must folowe a smal effecte.
All these reasones go to this ende, that
persones of all contries of moderate
and good diete, escape thys Englishe
<hi>Ephemera,</hi> and those be onely vexed
there with, whiche be of immoderate
and euill diete. But why? for the euill
humores and corrupte aier alone? No.
for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pestilence and not the swet
should rise. For what then? For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
spirites corrupte in theim selues
and by the infectiue aier. Why so?
for that of impure and corrupte hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores,
whether thei be blode or others,
can rise none other then impure spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.
For euery thynge is suche as that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:5120:20"/>
whereof it commeth. Now, that of
the beste and fineste of the blode, yea
in corrupte bodies (whyche beste is
nought) these spirites be ingendred
and fedde, I before expressed. Therfor
who wyl haue them pure and cleane,
and him selfe free from sweat, muste
kepe a pure and cleane diete, and then
he shalbe sure.</p>
            <p>Infection by the aier,<note place="margin">The preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacion.</note> and impure
spirites by repletion thus founde and
declared to be the causes of this pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lente
sweate or Englishe <hi>ephemera,</hi>
lette vs nowe see howe we maye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
our selues from it, and howe it
may be remedied, if it chaunce, wyth
lesse mortalitie. I wyll begynne wyth
preseruation. That most of all dothe
stande in auoidyng the causes to come
of the disease, the thinges helping for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

is alredy had &amp; gotten. Al be done
by the good order of thynges pertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
to the state of the body. Therfore
I will begin with diete wher I lefte,
&amp; then go furth with aier where I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
<pb facs="tcp:5120:21"/>
in treatyng the causes, and declare the
waie to auoide infection, and so furthe
to the reste in order. Who that
luste the to lyne in quiete suretie, out
of the sodaine danger of this Englishe
<hi>ephemera,</hi> he aboue all thynges, of
litle and good muste eate &amp; spare not.
the laste parte wherof wyl please well
(I doubt not) vs Englishe men: the
firste I thinke neuer a deale. Yet it
must please theim that entende to lyue
without the reche of this disease. So
doyng, they shall easely escape it. For
of that is good, can be engendred no
euill: of that is litle, can be gathered
no great store. Therfore helthful must
he nedes be and free from this disease.
that vsethe this kinde of liuynge and
maner in dietynge. An example hereof
may the wise man <hi>Socrates be,</hi> which
by this sorte of diete escaped a sore pes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tilence
in Athenes, neuer fleynge ne
kepyng close him felfe from the same.
Truly who will lyue accordynge to
nature and not to lust, may with this
diete be well contented. For nature is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:5120:21"/>
pleased with a litle, nor seketh other
then that the mind voide of cares and
feares may be in quiete merily, and the
body voide of grefe, maye be in life
swetly, as <hi>Lucretius</hi> writeth. Here

and the thousande commodities
therof, both for helthe, welthe, witte,

rather then reasones. But for that I
purpose neither to wright a longe

and holsomly kylled, swetly saued,
and wel prepared in rostyng, sethyng,

corne, wel leuened, and so baked. The
drinke of swete malte and good water
kyndly brued, without other drosse
nowe a daies vsed. No wine in all the
tyme of sweatyng, excepte to suche
whose sickenes require it for medicin,
for fere of inflamynge &amp; openynge, nor

helthe, mine aduise is, that all your

For in al the discurse, preseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and

not in the fitte. Alwayes remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryng,
not to go out fastinge. For as

vnderstande, that in the mornynge
we shal streight as our clothes be on,
stuffe our bellies as fulle as Englishe

oure preseruatiues, or with a litle me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

For other wise nature, if the disease

I will now shortely write as of a
thing very necessary for the conserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of mannes healthe. For if that
whiche is euel within, be not by good
meanes &amp; wayes wel fet oute, it often
times destroyeth the lyfe. Good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes
to fet out the euelle stuffe of the

            <p>Abstinence, in eatynge and drinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge
litle, as a lytle before I sayed,
<pb facs="tcp:5120:27"/>
and seldome. For so, more goeth awaie
then comethe, and by litle and litle it
wasteth the humours &amp; drieth. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
(as I wiene) throughe the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seil
of Phisike, &amp; by the good ciuile,
&amp; politique ordres, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring the wealth

lothesomenesse or wearinesse, by

the lande, an ordre (without the whiche
nothing can stand) and comon wealth,
dayes of abstinence, and fasting were
firste made, and not for religion onely.</p>
            <p>Auoidance, because it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done withoute the healpe of a good
Phisicien, I let passe here, expressing
howe it shoulde bee done duelye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge
to the nature of the disease
and the estate of the personne, in an
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:5120:27"/>
other booke made by me in Latine
vppon this same matter and dise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ase.
Who therfore lusteth to see more,
let him loke vpon that boke. Yet here
thus much wil I say, that if after eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation
or auoiding of humors, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
of the skinne remaine close, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
sweating excrement in the fleshe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
grosse (whiche thinge howe to
know, hereafter I will declare) then
rubbe you the person meanly at home,
&amp; bathe him in faire water sodden with
Fenel, Chamemil, Rosemarye, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
&amp; Lauendre, &amp; last of al, powre
water half colde ouer al his body, and
so dry him, &amp; clothe him. Al these be to
be don a litle before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> end of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> spring,
that the humours may be seatled, and
at rest, before the time of the sweting,
whiche cometh comonly in somer, if it
cometh at al. For the tormoiling of the
body in that time when it ought to be
most quiete, at rest, and armed against
his enemy, liketh me not beste here, no
more then in the pestilence. Yet for the
presente nede, if it be so thoughte good
<pb facs="tcp:5120:28"/>
to a learned and discrete Phisicien, I
condescend the rather. For as in thys,
so in alle others before rehearsed,
I remytte you to the discretion of
a learned manne in phisike, who maye
judge what is to be done, aud how, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the present estate of youre
bodies, nature, custome, and proprety,
age, strength, delyghte and qualitie,
tyme of the yeare, with other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunces,
aud thereafter to geue the
quantitie, and make diuersitie of hys
medicine. Other wise loke not to rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iue
by this boke that good which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
but that euel which by your ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
foly you vudiscretelye bring. For
good counseil may be abused. And for
me to write of euery particular estate
and case, whiche be so manye as there
be menne, were so great almost a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
as to numbre the sandes in the sea.
Therfore seke you out a good Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cien,
and knowen to haue skille, and at
the leaste be so good to your bodies, as

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende
exercise, whiche in vs Englishe

Yet I vtterly reproue theim not,
if the hurt may be auoyded. For these
a conueniente tyme is, before meate:

Thus I speake of solace, that I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

A faulte maketh necessitie, in

for feare of opening the bodye, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing
the spirites, not approued, but
for dout, that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lengthing the boke, I
shold wery y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reader. Therfore I let y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
passe &amp; come to sleping &amp; waking, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:5120:31"/>
without good ordre, be gretly hurt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful
to the bodie. For auoiding the whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che,
I take the meane to be best, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this sweat moste commendable.
But if by excesse a man must in eyther
part offend, I permit rather to watch
to muche, then to lie in bedde to longe:
so that in watchinge, there be no way
to surfetting. Al these thinges due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obserued, and well executed, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
before I haue for preseruation
mencioned, if more ouer we can sette a
parte al affections, as fretting cares &amp;
thoughtes, dolefull or sorowfull ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
vaine feares, folysh loues,
guawing hates, and geue oure selues
to lyue quietly, frendlie, &amp; merily one
with an onther, as men were wont to
do in the old world, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this countrie
was called merye Englande, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man to medle in his own matters,
thinking theim sufficient, as thei do in
Italye, and auoyde malyce and dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
the destruction of commune we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>althes,
and priuate houses: I doubte
not but we shall preserue oure selues,
<pb facs="tcp:5120:32"/>
bothe from this sweatinge syckenesse,
and other diseases also not here purpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
to be spoken of.</p>
            <p>But if in leauinge a parte these or
some of them,<note place="margin">The cure or remedy.</note> or negligently executing
them, it chaunceth the disease of swea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting
to trouble our bodies, then passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nge
the bondes and compasse of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
we must come to curation, the
way to remedie the disease, &amp; the third
and last parte (as I first sayed) to be en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>treated
in this boke. The principalle
entente herof, is to let out the venime
by sweate accordinge to the course of
nature. This is brought to passe safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two waies, by suffring and seruing
handsomly nature, if it thruste it oute
readily and kindely: and helping natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
if it be letted, or be weake in expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge.
Serue nature we shall, if in
what time so euer it taketh vs, or
what so euer estate, we streyghte lay
vs downe vppon oure bedde, yf we be
vp and in oure clothes, not takynge
them of: or lie stille, if we be in bed out
of our clothes, laiyng on clothes both
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:5120:32"/>
wayes, if we wante, reasonably, and
not loadinge vs therewith vnmeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably.
Thus layed and couered, we
must endeuoure our selues so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
wyth al quietnes, &amp; for so much
as may be without feare, distruste, or
faintehartednesse, an euel thinge in al
diseases. For suche surrendre and geue
ouer to the disease without resistence.
By whiche occasion manye more died
in the fyrste pestilence at <hi>Athenes,</hi>
that I spake of in the beginnynge of
thys boke, then other wyse should.
Oure kepers, friendes and louers,
muste also endeuoure theym selues to
be handesome and dilygente aboute
vs, to serue vs redilye at al turnes,
and neuer to leaue vs duringe foure
and twentie houres, but to loke welle
vnto vs, that neyther we caste of oure
clothes, nor thruste out hande or foote,
duryng the space of the saide foure and
twenty houres. For albeit the greate
daungere be paste after twelue hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
or fourtene, the laste of trial, yet
many die aftre by to muche boldenes,
<pb facs="tcp:5120:33"/>
when thei thinke theim selues most in
suretye, or negligence in attendaunce,
when they thinke no necessitie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is proued that without dout, the
handsome diligence, or carelesse negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
is the sauing, or casting awaye
of many. If .ij. be taken in one bed, let
theym so continue, althoughe it be to
their vnquietnesse. For feare wherof,
&amp; for the more quietnesse &amp; safetye, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good it is duryng all the sweating
time, that two persones lye not in one
bed. If with this quietnes, dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
and ordre, the sicke do kindelye swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
suffre them so to continue, without
meate all the .xxiiij. houres: withoute
drincke, vntil the fifth houre, if it maie
be. Alwayes taking hede to theim in
the fourth, seuenth, nineth, &amp; eleuenth
houres speciallye, and fourtenth also,
as the laste of triall and daungier, but
of lesse in bothe. For these be most pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous,
as I haue obserued this yere in
this disease, hauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houres iudicial,
as others haue theire dayes, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
worse to geue anye thinge in, for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:5120:33"/>
troublyng nature standyng in trialle.
Yet wher more daunger is in forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
then in takyng, I counseill not to
spare in these howres to do as the case
requireth with wisdome &amp; discretion,
but lesse then in other howres. In
the fifthe howre geue theim to drinke
clarified ale made only doulcet with a
litle suger, out of a cruet, or glasse
made in cruet facion, with a nebbe, for
feare of raisynge theim selues to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the drinke offered, &amp; so to let the
sweat, by the ayer strikyng in. But
if the sicke on this wise beforesaid ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
sweate kyndly, then nature must
be holpen, as I sayd before. And for so
moch as sweat is letted in this disease
fower waies, by disorder, wekenes
of nature, closenes of the pores in the
skinne, &amp; grosnes of the humoures: my
counseil is to auoide disorder by suche
meanes as hetherto I haue taught,
and next to open the pores if they be
close, and make thinne the matter, if it
be grosse, and prouoke sweat, if nature
be weke. Those you shal doe by gentle
<pb facs="tcp:5120:34"/>
rubbynges, this by warme drinckes as
hereafter streight I will declare. And
for that euery man hath not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
to discerne which of these is the
cause of let in sweatyng, I wil shewe
you plainly howe to do with moste
suretie and leste offense. I wyll begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nne
with wekenes of nature. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
remember well that in treatynge
the causes of this disease, I sayed
that this sweate chauncethe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly
in theim of the mydde age and beste
luste, the infection hauyng a certein
concordance, or conuenience with the
corrupte spirites of theim more then
others. Knowe agayne that nature is
weke, ij. waies, either in the selfe, or
by the annoiance of an other. In the
selfe, by wante of strength consumed
by sicknes or other wise. By annoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce
of an other, when nature is so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaid
with the quantitie of euill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
that it can not stirre. Betwene
thes two set youre witte, and se whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be lustye or sickly. If he
be lustye, vnderstande that the sweat
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:5120:34"/>
doth not stoppe for wekenes of nature
in it selfe. Then of necessitie it must be
for some of thother causes. But for
whiche, thus knowe. Consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the lusty person were in foretyme
geuen to moche drynkyng, eatyng and
rauenyng, tomoch ease, to no exercise
or bathinges in his helth, or no. If all
these you finde in him, knowe that
bothe nature is wekened by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiance
of the humoures, and that
the skinne is stopped, and the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oure
grosse, and that for thys the
sweate is letted. If you finde onely
some of these, and that rauenynge,
annoiance is the cause. If want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
or bathinges, stoppinges of
the pores and closenesse, or grose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of humours, or bothe, be the cause
of not sweatyng. On the othersyde, if
the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be sickely, it is easely knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that his wekenes consisteth in nature
the self. And for so moche as weke fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
and sicke shal also by other causes
not sweate, consider if in his sickenes
he hath swette moche or no, or hath be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:5120:35"/>
disposed to it and coulde not. If he
neither hath swette, nor coulde sweat
disposed, knowe that closenes of the
skinne, and grosenes of the humour is
the cause. Therfore euery thing in his
kynde muste be remedied. Wekenes of
nature, by drinkes prouokyng sweate:
closenes, &amp; grosenes, by rubbynge, as
I said. But be ware neither to rubbe
or geue drinkes, excepte you see cause
as beforesayd. Forother wise, the one
hindrethe nature, and thother letteth
out the spirites &amp; wasteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strength.
Therefore accordyngly, if rubbe you
must, geue to the sicke in to their bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
a newe and somewhat harde ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chefe,
well warmed but not hote, aud
bydde theim rubbe all their bodies
ouer therewith vnder the clothes,
neither to moche neither to litle, nor
to harde or to softe, but meanely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene,
takyng you hede whiche be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute
theim, that by stirrynge their
armes they raise not the clothes to let
in the ayer. This done, if case so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a good draught of hote
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:5120:35"/>
possette ale made of swiete milke tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with vinegre, in a quarte wherof
percely, and sage, of eche haulfe one
litle handfull hath bene sodden, wyth
iii. sliftes of rosemary, ij. fenel rootes
cutte, and a fewe hole maces. Alwaies
remembrynge here, as in other places
of this boke, to heate the herbes in a
peuter dishe before the fyre, or washe
theim in hote water, before you putte
them in to the posset ale, and that you
putte their to no colde herbes at any
tyme durynge the hole fitte. Or geue
theim posset ale hote with rosemary,
dittane, &amp; germander. Or baie beries,
anise seades, &amp; calamintes with claret
wine sodden and dronke warme. Or
white wine with hore and wilde tansy
growen in medes sodden therin, and
ii. <abbr>d.</abbr> weight of good triacle, dronke
hote, or in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> stede of that, wilde tanesy,
mogwort or feuerfue. These prouoke
sweat, may easely be hadde, &amp; be metest
for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which haue al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> causes before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayde
of lettyng the same. But speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if for colde and grose humoures, or
<pb facs="tcp:5120:36"/>
for closenes of the skinne, the sweate
commethe not furthe. If with one
draught they sweate not, geue theim
one other, or .ii, successiuely, after halfe
one houre betwene, and encrease the
clothes, first a litle aboue the meane,
after, more or lesse as the cause requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
&amp; make a litle fire in the chamber
of clene woode, as ashe &amp; oke, with the
perfume of bdellium: or swiet woode,
as Iuniper, fyrre, or pine, by theim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
remembrynge to withdrawe
the fire, when they sweat fully, and
the clothes aboue the meane, by litle
and litle as you laide theim on, when
they firste complaine of faintyng. And
after .xii. or .xiiii. houres, some also of
the meane, but one after an other by
halfe one houre successiuely with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecion,
alwaies not lokyng so moche
to the quantitte of the sweat, as what
the sicke maye saufely beare. And in
suche case of faintynge, suffer compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
open aier to come into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
if thesame and the wether be hote,
for smoderynge the pacient, by suche
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:5120:36"/>
windowes as the wynde liethe not in,
nor openeth to the south. Put to their
noses to smell vinegre and rose water
in an handkercher, not touchynge
theim there with so nighe as maye be.
Cause theim to lie on their right
side, and bowe theim selues forward,
call theim by their names, and beate
theim with a rosemary braunche, or
some other swete like thynge. In the
stede of posset ale, they whiche be
troubled with gowtes, dropsies, reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
or suche other moiste euill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
chauncing to sweat, may drinke
a good draught of the stronger drinke
of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> so hote as they can,
for the lyke effecte, as also others
may, not hauynge these deseases, if it
be so redy to theim as the other. After
they ones sweate fully, myue aduise is
not to geue any more posset ale, but
clarified ale with suger, duryng the
hole fitte, neither vnreasonably, nor
so ofte as they call for it, neither yet
pinchyng theym to moche when they
haue nede, alwayes takynge hede
<pb facs="tcp:5120:37"/>
not to putte any colde thynge in their
mouthe to cole and moiste them with,
nor any colde water, rose water, or
colde vinegre to their face duryng the
sweat and one daie after at the leaste,
but alwaies vse warmeth accordynge
to nature, neuer contrariyng thesame
so nighe as may be. If they raue or be
phrenetike, putte to their nose the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
odour of rose water &amp; vinegre,
to lette the vapoures from the headde.
If they slepe, vse theim as in the case
of faintyng I said, with betyng theim
and callynge theim, pullyng theim by
the eares, nose, or here, suffering them
in no wise to slepe vntil suche tyme as
they haue no luste to slepe, except to a
learned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in phisicke the case appere
to beare the contrary. For otherwise
the venime in slepe continually run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
inward to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hart. The contrary
hereof we muste alwaies intende, in
prouokyng it outwarde by all meanes
duryng the fitte, whyche so longe last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in burnynge and sweatyng, as the
matter thereof hath any fyrie or apte
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:5120:37"/>
partes therfore. For as great &amp; strong
wine, ale, or bere, so longe do burne as
their is matter in theim apte to be
burned, and then cesse when that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
remainethe is come againe to hys
firste nature: that is, to suche water
clere &amp; vnsauery, as either the bruer
receiued of the riuer, or vine of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earth:
euen so the body so longe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuethe
burnynge and sweatynge, as
their is matter apte therefore in the
spirites, and then leaueth, when the
corrupcion taken of the finest of the
euill blode is consumed, and the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
lefte pure and cleane as they were
before the tyme of their corruption.</p>
            <p>This done, and the body by sufficient
sweate discharged of the venime, the
persone is saulfe. But if he by vnru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
&amp; brekyng his sweate, sweateth
not sufficiently, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is in daunger of
death by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> venime that doth remaine,
or at the leaste to sweat ones againe or
oftener, as many hath done, fallynge
in thrise, sixe tymes, yea, xii, tymes
some. If sufficiently the sweate be
<pb facs="tcp:5120:38"/>
come, you shal know by the lightnes &amp;
cherefulnes of the body, &amp; lanckenes
in all partes, by the continuall swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
the hole daie and out of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
whyche be the beste and holsome
sweates. The other which come but
by tymes &amp; onely in certein partes, or
broken, be not sufficient nor good, but
very euill, of whose insufficiency, ij.
notes learne: a swellyng in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partes
with a blackenes, &amp; a tinglyng or pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
in the same. Suche I aduise to
appointe theim selues to sweat againe
to ridde their bodies of that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
&amp; abide it out vntill they fele their
bodies lanke &amp; light, and to moue the
sweat as before I said, if the same come
not kyndly by the selfe. If they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not
forbeare meate during y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> space of their
fitte, and faste out their .xxiiij. houres,
without danger, geue theim a litle of
an alebrie onely, or of a thinne candel
of an egge sodden with one hole mace
or ij. If they be forced by nature to
ease them selues in the meane time, let
them do it rather in warme shetes put
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:5120:38"/>
into them closely, then to arise. After
they haue thus fully swette, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey
closely warme clothes into theyre
beddes, and bid them wipe themselues
there with in al partes curiouslye: and
be ware that no ayer entre into theire
open bodies (and speciallye their arme
holes, the openest &amp; rarest parte ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
to let the issue of that whych doeth
remaine. The lyke may be done in the
reste of their fitte, with lyke ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
for that clenlinesse comfortethe
nature, and relieueth the pacient. If
in duringe oute the foure and twentye
houres there be thought daungiere of
death without remouing, rather war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
well the other side of the bedde, and
wil hym to remoue himself into it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to take him vp &amp; remoue hym to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bed, which in no case mai be done.
For better is a doubtful ware hope,
then a certeine auentured death. The
foure and twenty houres passed duly,
they may putte on theire clothes war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
aryse, and refresshe theym selues
with a cawdle of an egge swietelye
<pb facs="tcp:5120:39"/>
made, or such other meates and sauces
reasonably and smally taken, as befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
I meucioned. And if their strength
be sore wasted, let theym smelle to an
old swiet apple (as Aristotle did by his
reporte in the boke <hi>de pomo</hi>) or hotte
new bread, as <hi>Democritus</hi> did, by the
record of <hi>Laertius</hi> in his life, either by
it self alone, or dipped in wel smelling
wyne, as Maluesey or Muscadelle, &amp;
sprinckled with the pouder of mintes.
Orenges also and Lemones, or suche
muske balles as I before described, be
thinges mete for this purpose. For as
I saied in my ij. litle bokes in Latine
<hi>de medendi methodo, of</hi> deuise to cure
diseases, there is no thinge more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
to the spirites then good and
swiet odoures. On this wise aduised
how to order your selues in al the time
of the sitte, now this remaineth, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte
you not to go out of your houses
for .iij. dayes, or .ij. at the least after the
fitte passed, and then wiselye, warely,
and not except in a faire bright daye,
for feare of swouning after great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptinesse,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:5120:39"/>
and vnwont ayer, or for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyng
nature by soubdaine strikyng in
of the same aier, colde, or euil, in to the
open body. For nature so forced, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
often tymes a sore and soubdaine
fluxe, as wel after auoidaunce of these
humores by sweate, (as was this yere
well sene in many persones in diuerse
contries of Englande for none other
cause) as of others by purgation.</p>
            <p>Thus I haue declared the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

causes, preseruations, and cures na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
