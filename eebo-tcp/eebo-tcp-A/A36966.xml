            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> HAD not presum'd to trouble you with the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Trifle, had I not bin proud of an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of Dedicating my self, as well as it, to your
service: Scribles of this Nature are usually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
only to insinuate the Author into the good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

confess another meaning, and acknowledge this Minute

my self, and Book, at the Feet of a true, Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<hi>English</hi> Nobleman, whose Virtues Lineally descended,
have justly received no blemish; One who may, like the

the Rebels; in which you faithfully shew'd the unvalued
Vertue of your Temper, sparing no Cost, nor ommitting
no Stratagem, that could advance to the eternal fixing our
Great (tho' then scarce settl'd) Monarch in this Throne;
as once your Immortal, and I hope (never forgotten) Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
did the late glorious Prince before. We cannot
now doubt, but that Almighty Providence has pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a long and happy Reign to our Great and Glorious
Master; his late wonderful, as well as fortunate suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
sufficiently shews the Eternal Arm was lifted
for him, in the Miraculous and speedy scattering and
confounding so formidable an Eenmy, as the Rebels
were, or wou'd have bin, upon the least fleshing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.
Nor shall we ever, I hope, forget your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Indefatigable Zeal, Policy and Diligence, in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and keeping a City, which they so vehemently
aim'd at, as highly conducing to their Designs; this
was a Piece of Service, which (without offence to any
one) I hope I may presume to say, none but the Son of
a <hi>Restorer</hi> could have done, the Brood of Rankest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
like the Plague, having reign'd there long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and the Mobile being all poison'd with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious
Tenets of a misled, ungrateful Vsurper;
who some years since took his Progress that way, to
prepare the Party for this purpose. This, Sir, your
very Enemies (if it is possible you can have any) must
acknowledge: Nor can I omit the Conflicts of your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
vexation, and dissatisfaction, by being disappointed



<pb facs="tcp:54477:3"/>
of ingaging the Enemy, as you heartily wish'd, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to do: I know the Noble Old General's Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
inspir'd ye; and your <hi>Martial</hi> Spirit even burnt with
the Lust of Action; you might well be said in this jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
to be tortur'd with as much rage for not fighting,
and Conquering, as a Masterly <hi>Poet</hi> has written of
your Glorious Father, when in the late <hi>Dutch</hi> War In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
almost a whole Fleet, he was disabled by <hi>Du
Ruyter.</hi>

            <head>PROLOGUE.</head>
            <stage>Spoken by Mr. HAINS with a Western Scyth in his Hand.</stage>
            <l>FROM the <hi>West,</hi> as Champion in defence of Wit,</l>
            <l>I come, to mow you Critticks of the Pit,</l>
            <l>Who think we've not improv'd what <hi>Fletcher</hi> Writ.</l>
            <l>This Godly Weapon first invented was</l>
            <l>By Whigs, to cut down Monarchy like Grass;</l>
            <l>But I know better how to use these Tools,</l>
            <l>And have reserv'd my Scythe to mow down Fools:</l>
            <l>Yet o' my Conscience they wou'd sprout again,</l>
            <l>And the <hi>Herculean</hi> Labour were in vain.</l>
            <l>The Pit, like <hi>Hydra</hi>'s, still wou'd yield supplies,</l>
            <l>From one lop't Block-head, twenty more would rise.</l>
            <l>A sort of City Critticks yonder sit,</l>
            <l>For this destroying Engine not unfit,</l>
            <l>Cuckolds were always Enemies to Wit;</l>
            <l>For Wit oft draws the Wife to leave her Spouse,</l>
            <l>To take a small refreshing at our House.</l>
            <l>Phantastick Tastes how hard it is to please!</l>
            <l>Critticks, like Flyes, have several Species.</l>
            <l>There's one that just has paid his grutch'd half-Crown,</l>
            <l>Cries, Rot the Play, Pox on't, let's cry it down.</l>
            <l>The censuring Spark wou'd fain seem Great and Witty,</l>
            <l>Yet Whispers Politicks with Orange <hi>Betty;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>She cracks his Philberds, whilst he, in her Ear,</l>
            <l>Is Fighting o're again the Western War,</l>
            <l>Bragging what numbers his sole Arm has kill'd,</l>
            <l>Tho' the vain Fop perhaps was ne're i'th' Field.</l>
            <l>Thus Worm that snugs in Shell where it was bred,</l>
            <l>Is nothing to the Maggot in his head,</l>
            <l>For Harmless Insect that those Nuts create</l>
            <l>Is nothing to the Maggot of the Pate,</l>
            <l>Now such a Fop as this wou'd I be at.</l>
            <l>Another to compleat his daily Task,</l>
            <l>Fluster'd with Claret, seizes on a Mask,</l>
            <l>Hisses the Play, steals off with Punk i'th' dark,</l>
            <l>He Damns' the Poet, but she Claps the Spark.</l>
            <l>I wonder if the Law cou'd doom one dead,</l>
            <l>That now should lop off such a Fellow's Head!</l>
            <l>It cannot be found Murther.‚ÄîAnd to share</l>
            <l>This dreadful Fate, You Critticks all prepare.</l>
            <l>For besides all my Scythians yet unseen,</l>
            <l>We've yet a Female Common-wealth within,</l>
            <l>Who strongly Arm'd, like Furies venture on,</l>
            <l>And if y'approach their Trenches once, y'are gone.</l>

                     <p>I can guess at it, and am too sensible of the Villany of that

to his usual manner, fetching a Rhumatick Cough from the

                     <p>'Tis a sad Tale; but I can deny you nothing: If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
then, I told you that <hi>Don Sebastian</hi> was my Father. A gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Portuguise;</hi> of Noble House, and Nature; and Governour of
several large Plantations in the Happy Islands; his Industry and Care
made him so rich, that he might vie with Princes; so stor'd he was
with Friends and Gifts of Fortune! But many years he had not thus
continued, when Hell contriving how to blast our Joys; drove on our
Shore a number of <hi>French Pyrates;</hi> of which <hi>La Mure</hi> was the most
Villainous, and being Captain of the rest, and well stor'd with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
enter'd upon our Fortress, ruin'd our Plantations; and
chas'd the Peaceful Industrious <hi>Portugals,</hi> like Flocks of Sheep upon
the barren Mountains.</p>

                     <p>My Father, in this distress, willing to save his Treasure, with
the help of my Brother, and a Party of Negro Slaves, secretly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
his Plate, Money, and Jewels into a small Vessel, and put to Sea,
with design-to return, when they were gone, and comfort us with
his Fortune and Policy.</p>

                     <speaker>Amin.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh it was fatal! For this Curst <hi>La Mure</hi> having Intelligence
by his Spies of my Fathers escape, and not knowing how to pursue
him, turn'd his rage upon my poor Mother, my Sister, and my self.
And having Laden his Ship with the Spoils and Riches of our Island,
carried us with him, and the put to Sea.</p>

                     <p>You shall know instantly. And the greatest Barbarity that
ever Villain acted: For sailing thence a few Leagues, and resolving
to be revenged on us, for the loss of my Father's Treasure, he leaves
my sighing Mother and a little Sister alone and comfortless upon a
wild and barren Island.</p>

                     <p>How, a better Title! Faith, methinks a Widdow, and
a Woman of your Sense, should think my Title better than his, by
twenty years purchase, by your favour, Madam.</p>

found to be a Wife.</p>

                     <p>Even so. And to this very Gentleman, that lays such Claim.

            <l>To hope her first Essay should please you Men:</l>
            <l>You cannot taste what such a Creature speaks;</l>
            <l>Would she were three years older for your sakes;</l>
            <l>Two handfuls taller, a Plump pretty Lass,</l>
            <l>I doubt not then my Epilogue would pass.</l>
            <l>But, as I am, for your Applause I sue,</l>
            <l>Pray spare me for the Good that I may do.</l>

            <l>For, tho' not Power, I have the Will to please,</l>
            <l>And Will's a mighty help in such a Case.</l>
            <l>We on this fruitful Soyl have Women seen,</l>

            <l>Oh Iemminy! what is the Cause of that?</l>
            <l>I wonder what they Eat to grow so Fat?</l>
            <l>We young ones know not how that business is;</l>
            <l>But for all that we may be allow'd to guess;</l>
            <l>And I beginning now to chatter Sence,</l>
            <l>Encourag'd, may divert a Twelve-month hence:</l>
            <l>And therefore humbly thus I make Address,</l>
            <l>Excuse Faults, and accept my Will to please;</l>
