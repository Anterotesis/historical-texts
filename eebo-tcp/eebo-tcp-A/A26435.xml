            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There be some few Seas which have no intercourse with the <hi>Ocean,</hi> as <hi>Mare Mortuum,</hi> neare <hi>Palestina, Mare Caspium sive Hircanum,</hi> not far from <hi>Armenia:</hi> and such a one is said to be in the North part of <hi>America.</hi>

               <p>That there doth not use any rain to fall in <hi>Egypt,</hi> besides other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then testimonies, and experiences of Travellers, may be gathered out of the Scripture, for in the 10 Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> God doth make an Antithesis between the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> saying that <hi>Egypt</hi> was watered as a man would water a garden of herbes, that is to say, by the hand: But they should come into a Land which had hills and mountaines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which was watered with the raine of Heaven: and yet some have written, that ever now and then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is mists in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which yield, though not raine, yet a pretty dew.</p>

               <p>It is most probably conjectured, that the falling and melting of snow from those hils which be called <hi>Lunae Montes,</hi> do make the increase of the River <hi>Nilus.</hi> And the custome of the people in the Southerne parts of <hi>Arabia</hi> is, that they do receive into ponds and dams, the water that doth hastily fall, and the same they let out with sluces, some after some, which causeth it ordinarily to come down into the plaines of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

               <p>The second warre was begun by <hi>Hanniball,</hi> who brake the league, and after he had taken same part of <hi>Spaine</hi> from the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Sagantum,</hi> a City of their friends, came first over the <hi>Pyrena</hi> hils to <hi>France,</hi> then over the <hi>Alpes</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> where he overthrew the <hi>Romanes</hi> in three great battels, and much endangered their estate; he continued in <hi>Italy</hi> with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, sixteen yeares, till <hi>Scipio</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting on <hi>Carthage,</hi> forced <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball</hi> to return to rescue his own Countrey.

               <p>In the third warre (because the people of <hi>Carthage</hi> still brake the league) their City was razed to the very ground by the earnest and continuall counsell of <hi>Cato</hi> the elder, fearing evermore so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Neighbour, though <hi>Scipio</hi>

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:101299:98"/>
of this Land, who was afterward mother to the renowned <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi> But when the <hi>Romans</hi> had their Empire much weakned, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their owne discords, and partly by that decay which the irruptions of the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi> and such like invaders did bring upon them, they were forced to retire their legions from thence, and so leaving the Countrey naked, the Scots, and certaine people cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Pictes, did breake in, who most miserably wasted and spoiled the Country. Then were the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants (as some of our Authors write) put to that choise, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they must stand it out and be slaine, or give ground, till they came to the sea, and so be drowned.</p>

But certaine it is, that they had their name for
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:101299:99"/>
painting themselves, which was a common thing in <hi>Brittaine</hi> in <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi> time, as he reporteth in his Commentaries, the men colouring their faces with Glastone or Ode, that they might seem the more dreadfull, when they were to joyn battell.</p>
               <p>To meet with the cruelty and oppression of these Barbars, the<note place="margin">Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Saxons.</note> 
                  <hi>Saxons</hi> were in the third place by some of the Land called in, who finding the sweetnesse of the soile and commodiousnesse of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey every way, did repaire hither by great troops, and so seated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves here, that there were at once of them seven several Kingdomes, and Kings within the Compasse of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These <hi>Saxons</hi> did beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with much more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and placability towards those few of the Countrey that remained, then the <hi>Pictes,</hi> had done: but yet growing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, one of their Kings with another, partly about the bounds
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:101299:99"/>
of their territories, and partly about other quarrels, they had many great battels each with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>In the time of these, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and devotion.</note> and Devotion, was much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and divers Monasteries, and rich Religious houses were founded by them partly for pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which they would do, and partly otherwise; because they thought it too meritorious: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that King <hi>Edgar</hi> alone, is recorded to have built above foure severall Monasteries. And some other of their Kings were in their ignorance so devoted, that they gave over their Crownes, and in superstition did goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to lead the lives of private men.</p>
               <p>These seven Kingdomes in the end, did grow all into one; and then the fourth and most grievous scourge and conquest of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, came in the <hi>Danes;</hi> who<note place="margin">Fourthly the Danes.</note> Lording it here divers yeares, were at last expelled; and then <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>

decaied; and also that many people in the Island were yet Infidels: For the conversion of whom, as also for the reforming of the other, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> was sent hither, where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himselfe so proudly, that the best of the Christians which were here, did mislike him.

                  </hi> which did contain a great part of all

               <p>Since that time it hath pleased God more and more to blesse this Land, but never more plentifully then in the daies of our late, and now raigning Soveraigne, whose raigne continuing long in peace, hath peopled the Land with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of inhabitants: hath stored<note place="margin">The riches of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</note> it with Shipping, Armour, and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, hath fortified it many waies, hath encreased the trafficke with the Turk and Muscovite, and many parts of the earth farre distant from us, hath much bettered it with buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and enriched it with Gold and Silver, that it is now (by wise men) supposed, that there is more Plate within the Kingdome, then there was Silver when her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty came to the Crowne. Some Writers of former times, yea, and those of our owne Countrey too, have reported that in England have
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:101299:102"/>
been Mynes of Gold, or at the least some gold taken out of other Mynes: which report hath in it no credit, in as much as the Country standeth too cold, neither hath it sufficient force of the Sun to concoct and digest that metall. But truth it is that our Chronicles do witnesse, that some silver hath been taken up in the Southerne parts, as in the Tin-mines of Devonshire and Cornwall, and such is sometimes found now; but the virtue thereof is so thin, that by that time it is tried and perfectly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it doth hardly quit the cost: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, Lead, Iron, and such basers metals, be here in good plenty</p>
               <p>The same reason which hindreth gold ore from being in these parts, that is to say, the cold of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, doth also hinder that there is no wine, whose grapes grow here. For although we have grapes, which in the hotter and warm summers do prove good, but yet many times are nipped in the frost before they be ripe, yet notwithstanding they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to that concocted maturity
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:101299:103"/>
as to make sweet and pleasant wine; yet some have laboured to bring this about, and therefore have plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vineyards, to their great cost and trouble, helping and aiding the soil by the uttermost diligence they could; but in the end it hath proved to very little purpose.</p>
               <p>The most rich commodity which our Land hath naturally growing, is Wooll, for the which it is renowned<note place="margin">The rich commodity of wooll.</note> over a great part of the Earth.

               <p>It was a tradition among old writers, that Britaine did breed no Wolves in it, neither would they live here; but the report was fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, in as much as our Chronicles do write<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there were here such store of them, that the Kings were enforced to lay it as an imposition upon the Kings of Wales, who were not able to pay much mony for tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, that they should yearly bring in certaine hundreds of Wolves; by which meanes they were at the length quite rid from Wolves.</p>

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:101299:127"/>

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:101299:129"/>
certain Argument that they were near to the Land: as it fell out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>The first Land whereunto they came, was an Island<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> called by the<note place="margin">The Island Haity.</note> Inhabitants <hi>Haity,</hi> but in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of <hi>Spaine</hi> from whence he came, he termed it <hi>Hispaniola:</hi> and<note place="margin">The richs of the country:</note> finding it to be a Countrey full of pleasure, and having in it abundance of Gold and Pearle, he proceeded further<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and discovered another bigge Isle, which is called <hi>Cuba:</hi> of the which being very glad, with<note place="margin">The Island Cuba.</note> great treasure he returned unto <hi>Spaine,</hi> bringing joyful newes of his happy successe.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Columbus</hi> did adventure to restraine the time of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation within the compasse of three daies, engaging himself to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, if in that space they saw no Land; there be some write, that he limited himself not at all adventures, but that he did by his eye discerne a difference in the colour, of the clouds which did arise out of the west, from those which formerly he
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:101299:130"/>
had seen: which clouds did argue by the clearnesse of them, that they did not arise immediately out of the Sea, but that they had passed over some good space of the Land, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by grew clearer and clearer, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in them any new or late risen vapours: but this is but conjectural.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards, who are by nature a people proud; have since the death of <hi>Columbus,</hi> laboured to obscure his fame, envying that an <hi>Italian</hi> or stranger should be repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the first discoverer of those parts.</p>
               <p>And therefore have in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings since given forth, that there was a <hi>Spaniard</hi> which had first been there; and that <hi>Columbus</hi> meeting<note place="margin">The pride of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure the fame of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus.</note> with his Cards and descriptions, did but pursue his enterprize, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the glory to himself.</p>
               <p>But this fable of theirs doth savour of the same spirit wherewithall many of them in his life time did reproach him, that it was no matter of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to find out these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but that, if that he had not done
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:101299:130"/>
it, many other might, and would. Which being spoken to <hi>Columbus</hi> it a solemne dinner, he called for an Egge, and willed all the guests one after another to set it up on end. Which when they could not do, he gently bruising the one end of it, did make it flat, and so set it up, by imitation whereof each of the other did the same: whereby he mildly did reprove their envy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and shewed how easie it was to do that which a man had seen done before.</p>
               <p>To go forward therefore: <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus</hi> being returned to <hi>Castile,</hi> after his welcome to the Princes, was made Great Admirall of <hi>Spain,</hi> and with a new Fleet of more Ships was sent to search further: which he accordingly did, and quickly found the maine Land, not farre from the Tropick of <hi>Cancer.</hi>

with Guides of the Countrey, to see and make report thereof unto him; two of which ten venturing further than the rest, saw the mouth of this fiery gulph at the hils top: and had they not happily soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned towards their fellows, and sheltered themselves under a rock on the side of the hill, such a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of stones were cast out with the flame, that by no meanes they could have escaped.</p>
               <p>The English-men also desirous by<note place="margin">Of Virginia the first plantation.</note> Navigation to adde something un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Countrey, as before time they had travelled toward the farthest North part of <hi>America,</hi> so lately finding that part which lieth between <hi>Florida</hi> and <hi>Nova Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> was not inhabited by any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and was a Land fruitfull and fit to plant in, they sent thither two severall times, two severall compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as Colonies to inhabite that part, which in remembrance of the Virginity of their Queen they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Virginia.</hi> But this voyage being enterprized upon by private men,

to open something higher than <hi>Nova Francia:</hi> and therefore with some Ships they did passe thither, and entred upon the Land, from whence they brought some of the people, whose countenance was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tawny and dusky; which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not by any heat, but the great cold of the Climate, chilling and pricking them: but the digestion and stomack of these people is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, insomuch that like unto the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and some other Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations, their feeding was (for the most part) upon raw meat, their manners otherwise being barbarous and suitable to their diet.</p>
               <p>They had little leatherne Boats, wherein they would fish neare the brinks of the Sea, and at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure would carry them from place to place on their backs.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all their pains there taken, it was a great errour and ignorance in our men, when they supposed that they should find good store of Gold-mines in those quarters: for the country is so cold,

that it is not possible to find there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny full concoction of the sun, to breed and work such a metall within the ground; and therefore howsoe ver they brought home some store of earth, which they supsed to be Ore, and of shining stones; yet when it came to the triall it proved to be nothing worth, but verified the Proverb, <hi>All is not Gold that glisters.</hi>

               <p>In very many parts of these Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Countries of <hi>America,</hi> there is very fit and opportune fishing some pretty way within the sea, and therefore divers Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> do yearly send fishers thither, with shipping and great store of salt: where when they have taken fish; and dried it, and salted it at the land, they bring it home into <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,</hi> and utter it commonly by<note place="margin">The fish of New found, land.</note> the name of <hi>New found-land-fish.</hi>

               <p>But whether this be the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the straightnesse of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, it may be doubted, from the authority of S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> who in one of his treatises mentioning that the children of the noblest and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> greatest <hi>Romans</hi> in his time were very croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, when other which were breed of meaner parents were not so, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth it to this cause, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen of <hi>Rome,</hi> in a kind of

wantonness did not suffer their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be so long swathed as poorer people did, and that thereby their joynts and members not being tied and restrained within compass, did flye out of proportion.</p>
               <p>Certainly, howsoever there may be some reasons naturally given of these things, it is much to be ascribed to the immediate will of God, who giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and taketh away beauty at his pleasure.</p>

               <p>The Maps which were made at first concerning <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> did so describe the western part of <hi>Peru,</hi> as if when a man had passed. <hi>Magellane</hi> straits, and did intend to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards <hi>nova Hispania,</hi> on the

               <p>But our <hi>English</hi> men which went with S. <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> did by their own experience certainly find that the land from the uttermost end of the Straits on <hi>Peru</hi> side, did go up towards the South directly, without bending to the West, and that is the cause whereof all the new Maps and Globes, especially made by the <hi>English,</hi> or by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have taken their directions from our men, are reformed according to this new observation.</p>

               <p>Things memorable in this country, are reported to be very few: only in the East part of it, over against the <hi>Moluccoes,</hi> some have written that there be very waste Countries &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesses; but we find not so much as mention whether any do inhabite there or no.

                  <hi>Ortelius</hi> and <hi>Mercator,</hi> and all our late makers of Maps, because in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing this Continent, they make no mention of any Cities, Kingdoms, or Common-wealth which are sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and placed there: whereof he seemed in confidence of words to avouch that there be a great many, and that it is as good a Countrey as<note place="margin">Note.</note> almost any in the world: But the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments why he gathered it to be so he did not deliver; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it may be most probably conjectured, that the Creator of the world would not have framed so huge a masse of Earth, but that he would in his wisdome appoint some reasonable creatures to have their habitation there.</p>
               <p>Concerning those places which may be supposed to lie neer unto the Northern Pole, there hath in times past something been written, which for the particularity thereof might carry some shew of truth, if it be not throughly lookt into. It is therefore by an old tradition delivered, and by some written also, that there was
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:101299:169"/>
a Friar of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who took on him to travel into those parts which are under the very Pole: which he did partly by Negromancy (wherein he was much skilled) and partly again by taking advantage of the frozen times, by meanes whereof he might travell upon the Ice even so as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self pleased: It is said therefore of him, thàt he was directly under the Pole, and that there he found a very huge and blackrock, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly<note place="margin">Nigra Rupes.</note> called <hi>Nigra rupes,</hi> and that the said rock being divers miles in circuit, is compassed round about with the Sea; which Sea being the breadth of some miles over, doth run out into the more large Ocean by four severall Currents, which is as much to say, as that a good pretty way distant from the <hi>Nigra Rupes,</hi> there are foure several lands of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable quantity: and being scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted round about the rock, although with some good distance, are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red each from other by the sea run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning between them, and making them all foure to be Islands almost

of equall bignesse. But there is no certainty of this report, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our best Mathematicians in this latter age have omitted it.</p>
               <p>Our travellers of later years have adventured so far, to their great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in those cold and frozen coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that they have descried <hi>Groin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
