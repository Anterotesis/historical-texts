         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:19721:13"/>
which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hee confuted out of Gods Holy Word, and by the authority of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Fathers, so that his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings went farre and neare, with approbation and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to wit, into <hi>Italy, Germany, France,</hi> and other Territories; and this was in the yeare of our Lord, 1020.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth cald a Councell at <hi>Vercellis,</hi> and did in it condemne this Doctrine of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> so also when <hi>Nicholas</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was Pope, he was cald to a Councell held in <hi>Rome,</hi> where by the bitter mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings

and courage from our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish <hi>Wickliffe:</hi> he was borne in <hi>Prague,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and proved a famous preacher in that slourishing Vniversity, he was Pastor of a Church in that towne, called the <hi>Bethleemish</hi> Kirch, where his Doctrines did iudicially op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Popes proceedings; hence Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the fifth, condemned him for an Heretique. In his time things tooke not good successe in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the <hi>Cardinals</hi> falling out amongst themselves, they chose three Popes: divers Kings tooke it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19721:17"/>
ill that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should be thus divided. Then in the yeare of Grace, 1414. there was a Councell held at <hi>Constance,</hi> for the redresse of these mischiefes, which now were got into the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. To this Councell was <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> called, by the Authority of the Emperor <hi>Sigismund,</hi> who had past his word faithfully for his safe comming thither, and for his returne from thence; he obeyd the Emperor, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to his promise; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither, neither was the Emperor <hi>Sigismunds</hi> promise availeable for his safety; for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19721:18"/>
it was contradicted by that Councell, and he cast into prison, with this censure. First, that faith in promises was not to be kept with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, and that though <hi>Sigismund</hi> promised him safe conduct thither, yet he promised not to safe guard him at his departure, and if he had, it was of no validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or force. The <hi>Bohemians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for him, but in vain; with such eagernes and zeale did those <hi>Roman</hi> Agents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute their cause, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adiudged both his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and his workes to bee burned: and when some of

them would have had him shaven, and others denyed it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that they could not agree: <hi>Hus</hi> pleasantly turning to the Emperor <hi>Sigismund,</hi> said, <hi>Though all these my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries bee cruell enough, yet they cannot agree in the manner of the performing it.</hi> At the last, they set a triple Crowne of Paper upon his head, and so upon the sixth day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the yeare following being 1415, this great scholler was burned.</p>

and vigilancy, not onely feeding the soules of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but also at all times di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing food to the bodies of the poore and distressed: And as he was admirable for his dextrous and pious go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the affaires of the <hi>Church,</hi> so was he also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned farre and wide for his learned works and writings, which foiled the Adversaries, and quite stopt their mouths, and rest yet unanswered, which did mightily dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their Cause. Hee writ both in <hi>Latine,</hi> and <hi>English;</hi> for hee was excellent in the knowledge of the Tongues:
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:19721:148"/>
but that piece which most wounded the <hi>Roman Cause,</hi> was his <hi>Apology for the Church of England,</hi> which worke is piously reserved, as a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of him, in all our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; so that it may be sayd of him, hee is dayly read in our Meetings, and whose fame is through all the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Peter Martyr</hi> for this his worke gave him great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations in these words: <hi>Apologia tua Frater charissime, &amp;c.

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:19721:180"/>
and set the Crowne upon his head, and was alwayes high in the Kings favour, but he grieved inwardly for Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> losse, and out-lived her but a few moneths; for in <hi>February</hi> next, 1603. hee dyed; but his sicknesse, King <hi>James</hi> hearing of, came to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and visited his Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bishop, and after many sweet words spoken to him, told him, that he would pray to God to give him life: The Arch-Bishop strove to speake in Latine to the King, but his words could not bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood; onely he often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated this, <hi>pro Ecclesia Dei,</hi>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:19721:181"/>
that is, <hi>for the Church of God,</hi> which were his last words, and so within few dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dyed, being aged 73. and Arch-Bishop more than 20 yeares: He was buried in the south side of the Church at <hi>Croydon,</hi> where there is a faire Tombe in memory of him: He performed many worthy charitable deedes in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where he lived; as at <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne, Worcester,</hi> in the Marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> but the chiefe of all, is that famous Hospitall or Almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house at <hi>Croydon,</hi> dedicated to the Sacred <hi>Trinity,</hi> in which a Warden and 24. Brethren
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:19721:181"/>
and sisters are nourished: To which hee adioyned a faire Free-schoole, with a house for the Schoole-master, and endowed those places with a sufficient yearely revenew. Many of his Chaplaines came to be Bishops: hee set forth no bookes, but onely one great volume in English, of the Rises, Ceremonies, and Ecclesiasticall polity of our Church defended, and one Sermon preached before Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> 24. of <hi>March,</hi> 1574.
