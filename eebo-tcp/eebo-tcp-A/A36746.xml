         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

On the
Mineral WATERS
OF
FRANCE,
Made in the
Royal ACADEMY
Of the
SCIENCES.</head>
            <p>THe Uſe of Mineral Waters
having deſervedly obtain'd
a great Eſteem and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the Cure of many
Chronical and Rebellious Diſeaſes;
ſome Phyſicians have applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40888:4"/>
to ſearch out, by Experiment,
their Nature and Principles; thereby
to judge how far they are proper for
certain Diſeaſes, and the particular
Conſtitution of the Diſeaſed: While
others have been contented to refer
themſelves to common Opinions foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the Obſervations of ſome Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>This Matter being ſubordinate to
Phyſical Speculation, the Royal Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy
of the Sciences have determined
to employ themſelves in the Enquiry of
the Qualities of thoſe in this Kingdom,
which are moſt conſiderable. And till
favourable occaſion may offer to make
Obſervations at their Springs, they have
cauſed theſe Waters to be brought from
ſeveral Provinces, with much care, to
examine them in the uſual Aſſemblies of
the Naturaliſts of this Academy.</p>
            <p>The Reſolution to proceed herein
has not been taken without much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration;
the Reaſons from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of theſe Waters for the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Health in many Diſeaſes, being
counterbalanced by thoſe of the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in knowing the Cauſes of their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40888:4"/>
Proprieties, which depend particularly
upon the Mixtures of certain Subſtances
which meet together in their Paſſages in
the Earth, or in the Cavities and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of Rocks, which are various and
many, as Vapours, Juices, Salts,
Earths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greateſt part of theſe ſubſtances,
wherewith Mineral VVaters are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate<gap reason="illegible: damage" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
cannot be diſcern'd; and
the different Mixture which is made of
ſeveral together, may conſtitute ſo great
a Number of Kinds of Mineral Waters,
wholſom or unwholſom, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to give any knowledge or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of them all. The Waters
of the ſame Springs may, at divers
times, receive conſiderable Alterations,
either by new Mixtures, or by the Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of thoſe which have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
made.</p>
            <p>It is not probable that theſe Waters,
called Mineral, ſhould be produced
alone by Mineral Vapours condens'd,
or that there is in the Earth Mines ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
abounding to furniſh continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Vapours capable, being condens'd,
to maintain a perpetual Courſe of theſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40888:5"/>
Waters in Springs which dry not. But
it may be that ſome Mineral Vapours
or Exhalations do mix with common
VVaters, which traverſe the Earths
where they meet and are condens'd,
and that theſe VVaters are impregnated
with their Qualities, and of ſome other
Volatile Salts not Concrete, elevated
in theſe dry Exhalations or humid Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours.
The diſtinguiſhing the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of theſe Exhalations and Vapours
is not eaſy; the Diverſity of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
is very great; the Rencounter
of their Mixtures is caſual; the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Places thro which they
paſs, and wherein they are retained, are
not evident; and the Alterations which
they produce in the Waters wherein
they inſinuate themſelves, are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
very manifeſt.</p>
            <p>There is no leſs difficulty to know
and diſtinguiſh the Juices which are
mixt with Mineral Waters, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
thoſe which receive nothing of
Concretion, and which communicate
to theſe Waters no ſenſible Quality; for
theſe liquid Juices, and wholly Volatile,
paſs in diſtillation with the ſubſtance of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40888:5"/>
the Water, and are no otherwiſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
than by Effects which ſimple Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cannot produce.</p>
            <p>The Juices, which are call'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete,
becauſe they are Condenſable
and Reſoluble, leave Sediments which
render them viſible and palpable after
the Diſtillation or Evaporation of the
Water wherewith they are mixt. But it
is difficult to diſcern their Kinds and
Proprieties, if they have no reſemblance
to thoſe which are already known, or
if they are many conjoin'd.</p>
            <p>The Salts and Earths are the moſt
ſenſible and moſt common ſubſtances
which mix with the Waters of Springs
and Wells. There is almoſt no ſort of
Earth which participates not of ſome
Salt diſſoluble in the Waters which
paſs thro it; and the Current of theſe
Waters carries away always ſome fine
Earth. This is found the moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
in theſe Waters: But the knowledg
of theſe Salts and Earths mixt in theſe
Waters, is not always ſo diſtinct as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
their Species, and make a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
judgment of their Properties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:40888:6"/>
There are few Concrete Salts known
to us: There may be many which have
no reſemblance with Common Salt, Nitre,
Alum or Vitriol, which are the four moſt
common Genders of Concrete Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Salts. Thoſe whoſe diſpoſition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Concretion is not yet compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and which are yet in <hi>Embryo</hi> or
their firſt Seminal Being, are leſs diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable
in that State: And thoſe
which are more formed, and either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Concrete, or capable of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
by ſome called Enix, that is
to ſay, born and come forth out of
their Matrixes, have not ſubſtances
Simple and Homogeneous in each
kind.</p>
            <p>The Salt which goeth under the
Name of Common Salt, contains two
different Parts mixt together; whereof
one is Condens'd and Chryſtalliz'd,
thro Cold in a Humid, after Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of one part of the Water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Salt hath been diſſolv'd; the
other is not Chryſtalliz'd or Condens'd,
but by a total Evaporation of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
Water. The former Part is
moſt Sulphurous, and by its Sulphureity
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40888:6"/>
mixeth with the Sulphurous Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
Calcin'd and Diſſolv'd by the Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of the Air, or in common Water,
without trouble and without Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But the other Part containeth an
Acidity which Coagulates in an inſtant
the diſſolv'd Salt of Tartar, and all
other fixt Salts, Sulphurous and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous.</p>
            <p>Vitriol, which ſhooteth forth by the
Humid Air on Sulphurous Marchaſites,
hath likewiſe a Succulent part, Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
only by a total Evaporation of its
Aqueous Humidity, of a taſte very
Acrimonious, of a conſiſtence Unctuous
and eaſily diſſoluble by a humid Air,
which Part is much different from that
which firſt is Condenſed and Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallized
thro Cold in Water wherein
this Vitriol hath been diſſolved. Theſe
Chryſtals are Pure Acid-Auſtere Vitriol,
whence there is precipitated much Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Earth by the mixture of Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and Nitrous Salts, with which the
other Part can mix without trouble, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not, as the firſt, this Acidity
whereon the Sulphurous Salts may act.
The contrary whereof happens to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40888:7"/>
Salt, whereof the firſt Part is the
moſt Sulphurous, and the ſecond moſt
Acid.</p>
            <p>The true Nitres are likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of two different Saline Parts; the
one more Sulphurous, which is Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalliz'd
thro Cold in a Humid;
the other, which remains diſſolv'd after
this Chryſtallization, and which is not
condens'd but by a Heat ſtrong enough
to drive away all the Diſſolvent Humid,
is leſs Sulphurous, and hath a certain
Acidity which the other hath not.</p>
            <p>The firſt Beings or Embryo's of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Salts are nothing elſe but Vapours,
or Juices Unconcrete, wholly Vapou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
whereof ſome may be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd,
and in part fixt by the force of
Fire; or be diſengag'd from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trixes,
and rendred capable of Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the means of the Air; which is
obſerv'd in certain Nitrous, Aluminous
and Vitriolic Salts. The Sulphurous
Salt which is found in the Calx of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
hard ſtones burnt in the Fire, and
which is a kind of true Nitre, had its
Seminary in theſe ſtones Crude; and in
this ſtate of its firſt Being is much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40888:7"/>
from what it acquires by the
Fire, which from being Cold and Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulative
rendreth it Cauſtic and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutive.
The Cold and Coagulative
Quality of this ſtony Salt in its firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is manifeſt enough in the Water of
the Springs of ſome Rocks, which are
very Clear and Cold, and which produce
Gouts and Cold Scirrhous Tumours in
thoſe who ordinarily drink of them.
This Seminary of ſtony Salt is rendred
Nitrous, Sulphurous, Cauſtic and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutive
by the Fire, which is able to
exalt it, but not to produce it in the
Calcination of theſe Stones, no more
than in burnt Oyſter-ſhells, whereof is
alſo made a Calx, which hath no leſs of
a Sulphurous Salt. This Embryonate
Salt in the Chalk-ſtones is a ſtony Juice,
which mixeth it ſelf with Waters which
paſs between the Beds and Interſtices
of theſe Stones in the Rocks, but is
not eaſily diſcern'd in the Waters im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
therewith.</p>
            <p>The Seminary of Alum and Vitriol
is alſo neceſſarily in the ſubſtances
whence theſe ſorts of Salts are drawn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
by the means of Water, after their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40888:8"/>
in the Fire, and Maceration in
the open Air. The Fire and the Air
which are able to exalt them, cannot
produce them. The Seminary of Alum
in the Aluminous Stones, and that of
Vitriol in Sulphurous Marchaſites, are
not in this ſtate manifeſt to our ſenſes;
and oftentimes they are not known in
Mineral Waters but by ſome Effects,
and that without certainty, becauſe
theſe Effects may be Equivocal.</p>
            <p>All theſe Diverſities of Mineral Salts,
Embryonate, Enix, Chryſtalline, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent,
Sulphurous, not Sulphurous,
of the firſt and of the ſecond Concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
thoſe alſo of their Genders, Species,
Mixtures, Proportions, Alterations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
render the Judgment of the Proprieties
of Waters partaking of them very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
and uncertain.</p>
            <p>The fine Earths which alſo are mixt
in Mineral Waters may be of ſeveral
Kinds difficult to be diſtinguiſhed: they
being of divers Colours; White, Grey,
Yellowiſh, Ruddy, Brown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
alſo of different Qualities. Some
are diſſoluble in diſtill'd Vinaigre,
others indiſſoluble; ſome may be mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40888:8"/>
others not, by Fire; wherein alſo
they receive diverſe Colours: Some
reſemble Marle, others Clay, others
Chalk, others Bole, ſome Sand, others
Talk, and others Calx; ſome are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by the Concretion of certain
Juices Saline or Sulphurous, others not;
ſome ſimply Mineral, others Metallic.
The moſt part of theſe Species being
difficultly diſtinguiſh'd when ſingle, are
much more when mixt.</p>
            <p>The ſimple Infuſions of certain Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-Sulphurous
Earths may remarkably
alter the Waters of Wells and Springs,
notwithſtanding there may remain no
Sediment from theſe Earths after Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
as happens in Liquors rendred
Emetic by the ſimple infuſion of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>The Hot Mineral Waters may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
ſome alteration by Sulphurous and
Bituminous ſubſtances meeting in their
Courſe; for theſe ſubſtances participate
of certain ſubtil Salts, which theſe
Waters may diſſolve and carry with
them.</p>
            <p>Some Mineral Waters, Cold or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,
have a Taſte ſomewhat Aigre,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40888:9"/>
or Vinous, which is not obſerv'd in
any of thoſe which are remarkably
Hot; but this Taſte is ſo eaſily loſt by
the leaſt Heat, and even by the Air,
that it is difficult to know what produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
it. This is found not only in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
eſteem'd Aluminous and Vitriolic,
but alſo in thoſe which are manifeſtly
Nitrous, and which abound in a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous
Salt oppoſite to Acids.</p>
            <p>The Cauſes of the Heat of certain
Mineral Waters are little known.
There is reaſon to doubt whether there
be Subterraneous Fires capable of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, or whether they receive this
Heat from the Exhalations of certain
Mineral Juices Fermentable, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there is cauſed an Efferveſcence by
the mixture of other Juices.</p>
            <p>All theſe Difficulties have hindered,
theſe four years, the advantage which
the Public might have receiv'd from the
Communication of what the Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
of the Academy have been able to
obſerve on Waters which have been
ſent them from ſeveral Provinces; and
which they have examined according
to the opportunities which they have
had.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:40888:9"/>
The Method which has been taken
in this Enquiry was to obſerve,</p>
            <p>1. From what Place they came.</p>
            <p>2. In what Time and Diſpoſition of
the Air they were taken from their
Springs.</p>
            <p>3. How long they had been put up
in Bottles to be ſent away.</p>
            <p>4. Whether they were preſerv'd
in Bottles that were clean and well
ſtopt.</p>
            <p>5. Whether they had made any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment

            <p>6. Whether they were clear or mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>7. Whether they had any manifeſt
Scent or Taſte.</p>
            <p>8. Whether their Weight differ'd
remarkably from that of ſimple and
Common Waters.</p>
            <p>9. Whether they took any Tincture
or Colour by certain Powders, as of
Galls, of Oak-leaves, Pomegranate-Bark,
of Myrobalans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. Whether having been expos'd
to the Air, or a little warm'd, they
would no more receive the Tincture or
Colour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:40888:10"/>
11. Whether being put to Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

there roſe and diſtill'd firſt of all ſome
Liquor more ſubtil than the reſt; and
whether there were found any difference
between the ſeveral parts of the ſame
diſtill'd Water taken apart.</p>
            <p>12. Whether in Evaporating or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling
theſe Waters by a gentle Heat,
there were form'd any Films on the
ſurface of the Water; or whether there
were made ſome Earthy Concretions
ſwimming in the Water in Flakes, or
adhering to the ſides of the Veſſels, or
ſettling to the bottom; and of what

            <p>13. Whether after Diſtillation, or

Liquor ſet in a cold place,
any Concretion Saline, Fibrous, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
Leafy, or otherwiſe figur'd.</p>
            <p>14. Whether the Water being total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Evaporated, or Diſtill'd off to a dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
left a Sediment, how much, and
of what ſort.</p>
            <p>15. Whether the Earthy Sediments
contain'd any Portion of Salt, or not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:40888:10"/>
16. To what ſort of Salts common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known, the Salts of theſe Waters
might be referr'd.</p>
            <p>17. Whether they caus'd Mercury
ſublimate diſſolv'd in common Water
to precipitate in a Red,<note n="‡" place="margin">Naca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</note> deep Crimſon,
or Yellow colour; and whether alſo
they caus'd the Sulphurous Earth of
common Vitriol to precipitate, as do
the true Nitre of the Ancients, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron

the Alcaliſate or fixt Sulphurous Salts
of Plants.</p>
            <p>18. Whether they changed into Green
the Colour of Syrup of Violets, and
whether they reſtored the Blue colour of
Tourneſole made Red by ſome Alumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
Vitriolic or other Acid; as the
true Nitres do.</p>
            <p>19. Whether they made Tourneſole
to become Red, as do Alum and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol.</p>
            <p>20. Whether they caus'd the Liquor
of the fixt Salt of Tartar diſſolv'd, to
thicken and coagulate quickly; as doth
the Succulent and ſecond Part of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt, which is not Condenſed but
by a Total Evaporation of the Water
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40888:11"/>
wherein the Salt hath been diſſolved.</p>
            <p>21. VVhether they made any change
in the VVater of the Diſſolutions of
Mercury Sublimate and Vitriol, or on
the colours of Tourneſole and Syrup of
Violets, or on the Liquor of Salt of
Tartar diſſolv'd, any more than Salt-Petre
doth, and the firſt Part of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt which thro Cold Chryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizes
in a Humid.</p>
            <p>22. VVhether the Earthy Sediments
of theſe VVaters, after the Separation
of their Salts, were wholly, or in part,
Diſſoluble in Vinaigre diſtill'd, and with
a certain Efferveſcence, as do ſome
ſort of Chalks, and alſo the White
Earth of the <hi>Coagulum</hi> of Nitrous and
Alkali-Salts, produc'd by the Mixture
of the ſecond part of Common Salt.</p>
            <p>23. Whether theſe Earthy Sediments,
freed from their Salts, being put in the
Fire, and ſtrongly burnt in Crucibles,
were fixt; whether they chang'd Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
were Vitrified or Calcined; or by
the means of Reductive Salts there
might be drawn forth ſomewhat Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallic,

purified, after having been melted by
the Fire in Crucibles of good Vitrified
Earth, they took any Colours extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.</p>
            <p>Theſe Methods of examining Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

            <p>According to this Enquiry made upon

            <p>All theſe Obſervations of the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of Salts which have been found in

Genders of Salts, Nitrous and Common,

The Differences obſerved between
the Nitrous Salts of theſe Waters, by

            <p>Some have become Blew, as doth

            </p>
            <p>Others became Red, as thoſe of the

            </p>
            <p>Others became only Greyiſh, as

As to the Differences obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Salts which may be referred
to the Gender of Common Salt, beſide
thoſe of the two different Saline ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
before mentioned, whereof the

of the VVater wherein this Salt is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
and which in an inſtant coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates
the Diſſolution of the Salt of
Tartar, and of true Nitre; there have
been remarked few other Particular
differences.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of the VVaters of divers
Springs of <hi>Bagniéres</hi> being melted by
Fire in the Crucibles, exhal'd forth
Vapours which rendred the Flame

theſe Salts being cool'd became of a

            <p>That of the VVater of <hi>Balleruc</hi> was
difficult to melt, and became Greyiſh:
That of the VVater of <hi>Availles</hi> crac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled

That of the VVater of <hi>S. Reyne</hi> had
a certain ſubtil Acrimony, as that of

which was manifeſt.</p>
            <p>There was not had much regard to
the Obſervations of the Forms and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of each of theſe Salts, as well Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous

becauſe theſe did vary in the

order to be purified.</p>
            <p>The Quantity of Salt, as well Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
as Common, wherewith each of
theſe Mineral VVaters are Impregnated,
cannot always be preciſely determined;
it being not always equal in the VVaters
of the ſame Springs, according to the
Conſtitutions of the Air, wet or dry,

            <p>There hath not been found in any of
theſe VVaters, either Alum or Vitriol
diſcernible in their Sediments. Theſe
ſubſtances which are reckoned in the
rank of Mineral Salts, are Concrete
Juices, condens'd by Evaporation of
the ſuperabundant Humidity diſſolving
them. They participate of much Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs
very fixt, and their Acid Spirits
are not ſeparated but by great Heat,
which raiſeth them with an Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a Corroſive Acidity.</p>
            <p>The Taſte ſomewhat Aigre or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
muſt needs proceed from other
mixtures than thoſe of Alum or Vitriol,

Vitriolic, ſweetiſh, and ſomewhat
Styptic. This Salt, being diſſolv'd in
Common Water, made the Tincture of
Tourneſole to become Red, almoſt as
Vitriol doth; and being mixt with the
Salt of Tartar, diſſolv'd alſo in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Water, became Black as Ink, and
precipitated a Black Earth: It being
otherwiſe with White Vitriol, which
doth not ſo much blacken with
the Salt of Tartar. It were proper to
enquire whether this Water of <hi>la Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minique</hi>
be Emetic, as that wherein Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol

            <p>ALL the Mineral Waters,
which have been brought to

ſome Hot, ſome Tepid, and others
Cold: They alſo differed among

Auſtere or Ferruginous; others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Savour very manifeſt, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid.
All theſe ſenſible Differences,
joyn'd to thoſe which have been moſt
remarkable in the Sediment of theſe
Waters after Diſtillation or Evaporation,
and principally in the Participation of
certain Salts, whereof ſome had a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance

of the Buildings, and the Care
which our Kings have taken ſince the
laſt Age in the repairing thereof, give
to theſe Waters the Prerogative to be
firſt conſidered.</p>
               <p>The Experiments have been made on
the Waters of <hi>le Lymbe,</hi> the Springs of <hi>la
Reyne, Eſcures,</hi> and <hi>S. Leger,</hi> brought
in the Beginning of the Spring-time.</p>
               <p>The Water of the great Well which
is called <hi>le Lymbe,</hi> is the warmeſt in
its Spring: It was Limpid and without
Taſte. Having been ſlowly diſtill'd,
there was found no difference between
what paſs'd firſt, and what laſt. It left
at the bottom of the Cucurbites about
1/640 Sediment, whitiſh and Salt, from
whence was ſeparated 1/10 Earth, the
other 9/10 were a pure Salt of the taſte
of Common Salt, which was condens'd
in Grains of a Cubic Figure, like Sal-Marine.
This Water continued always
Limpid in the Cucurbites during the
diſtillation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:40888:21"/>
To examine the Quality of this
Salt, by compariſon with Common Salt,
They caus'd to be diſſolv'd the one, and
the other, apart in four times the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Common Water, afterwards
They mixt them with the like Quantity
of Common Water wherein Mercury
Sublimate had been diſſolv'd; and it
was obſerved that by the mixture of the
Salt of the Water of <hi>le Lymbe</hi> there was
produced neither any Trouble, nor
Precipitation in the Sublimate Water, as
alſo neither in the diſſolution of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt. The ſame was obſerv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Diſſolution of Vitriol, which
was not troubled either by the Salt of
the Water of <hi>le Lymbe,</hi> or by Common-Salt.
Theſe two Salts being put apart
into Common Water tinctur'd with
Tourneſole, changed not the Blew Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
as do Alum and Vitriol, and all
other Acids which make it Red: But
they did both alike precipitate the Salt
of Lead diſſolv'd in Common Water,
and filtrated thro Grey Paper.</p>
               <p>Having thus compared the Salt of
the Water of <hi>le Lymbe</hi> with Common
Salt, and obſerv'd their Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40888:22"/>
together, They afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd
the Differences of this Salt of
the Water of <hi>le Lymbe,</hi> from Alum and
Vitriol, as well by Sight as Taſte, which
they found Conſiderable; that by the
Mixture made of theſe three ſubſtances
diſſolv'd apart in Common Water with
the Tincture of Tourneſole, the Blew Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
which chang'd into a Clear-Red by
the mixture of Alum, and into a Dark-Red
by the mixture of Vitriol, chang'd
not at all by the Salt of the Water of <hi>le
Lymbe</hi> no more than by Common-Salt.</p>
               <p>In comparing this Salt of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>le Lymbe</hi> with other Mineral Salts,
which are commonly known, it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that it fulminated not in the Fire
with Combuſtible ſubſtances, as doth
Salt-Petre; that the Taſte of one had no
reſemblance with that of the other; that
Salt-Petre diſſolv'd in Common Water
caus'd the Tincture of Tourneſole to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſomwhat Red; which the Salt of the
Water of <hi>le Lymbe</hi> did not, &amp; that Salt-Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
diſſolv'd in Common Water troubled
not the Diſſolution of the Salt of Lead,
as doth the Salt of the Water of <hi>le Lymbe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was alſo remark'd that this Salt of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40888:22"/>
the Water of <hi>le Lymbe</hi> was different from
true Nitre; foraſmuch as the true Nitre,
ſuch as is the Natron of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Borax, precipitated in an Orange-Colour
Mercury Sublimate diſſolv'd in
Common Water, which the Salt of the
Water of <hi>le Lymbe</hi> did not; which did not
ſo much as trouble this Diſſolution of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimate,
as doth Sal-Gemm which renders
it a little Milky, and as doth the Salt of
Marle which whiteneth it ſtill more.</p>
               <p>By all theſe Compariſons of the Salt of
the Water of <hi>le Lymbe</hi> with other known
Salts, it was obſerved that it had reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
only to Sal-Marine, and other like
Common Salts which are uſed for ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
and preſervation of Victuals.</p>
               <p>And becauſe Sal-Gem, and the
fixt Salt which is ſeparated from Salt-Petre,
in its refining, ſeem'd like to
Common Salt, they examined both one
and the other, to ſee to which of the
two the Salt of the Water of <hi>le Lymbe</hi>
had moſt reſemblance, and it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that it did more reſemble the fixt
Salt of Salt-Petre than Sal-Gemm, and
that herein it agreed alſo with Common
Salt. Sal-Gemm diſſolv'd in Water,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40888:23"/>
and plac'd to evaporate by a gentle
heat, does incruſt on the ſurface of the
Water; it troubles and makes White
the Limpid Diſſolution of Sublimate,
it turns into Yellow the Green Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of the diſſolution of <hi>German</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol;
and in a little time is condens'd
in long and tranſparent Fibres in that
Vitriol-Water; which the Salt of the
Water of <hi>le Lymbe</hi> did not, as neither did
Common Salt, and the fixt Salt of Salt-Petre.</p>
               <p>There appeared nothing Bituminous
or Sulphurous in all this Water, nor in
its Sediments.</p>
               <p>The other Waters of <hi>Bourbon Lancy,</hi>
which were thoſe of the Springs of <hi>la
Reyne, Eſcures</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Leger,</hi> &amp; which in their
Sources have different Degrees of Heat;
the firſt being moſt Warm, but leſs then
that of <hi>le Lymbe,</hi> the ſecond leſs than the
firſt, and the third only Tepid, were
found to have like Sediments and in like
proportion. All three had proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
ſomewhat leſs Salt than that of
<hi>le Lymbe,</hi> but otherwiſe their Salt was
alike. In <abbr>lb</abbr> V. of theſe Waters there
was almoſt <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j of Salt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:40888:23"/>
The Salt of theſe Waters being mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Fire in Crucibles became
only Grey; and the Earth ſeparated
from the Salt of the Water of <hi>le Lymbe</hi>
changing its Colour by the Fire became
very Brown, and contracted a certain
Brackiſhneſs; but that of the Waters of
the other Springs changed not.</p>

                  </note>The Water of the Bath of the Town,
and that of the Spring above the Bath
are alike. They were Limpid and
manifeſtly Salt.</p>
               <p>They were evaporated by a gentle
he at, in Earthen Veſſels, the better to
obſerve the Changes ariſing.</p>
               <p>During their Evaporation, made
apart, there were form'd Whitiſh Flakes,
which did ſwim in the middle of
the Liquor, and by degrees were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
to the bottom.</p>
               <p>The Total of the dry Sediment was
1/170 of the weight of the Water; it

only 1/20 Greyiſh Earth, which
ſuffer'd no change by the Fire; but
partly diſſolv'd in diſtill'd Vinaigre.

Water. The dry Sediment of <abbr>lb</abbr> viii.
of this Water diſtill'd, weighed only
Gr. xx. which contain'd but Gr. iv. of
a Ruddy and Gummous Salt, of an
Acrimonious Taſte, and reſembling
that of the Salt which is drawn from
Common Earth. The remainder was a
ſubtil Powder of a Grey Ruddiſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
which diſſolv'd not in diſtill'd Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naigre.
There was perceiv'd in this
Water but little of Vaporous Sulphurei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
This Water, according to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
made thereon, ought to be
rang'd in the Seventh Claſs.</p>
               <p>The Cures, which many Perſons trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with divers Diſtempers have ſaid
to have receiv'd by the Uſe thereof,
have excited the Curious to examine
well its Qualities upon the place, and
the Conditions of its Springs. They
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40888:53"/>
have obſerv'd that this Water was
found in ſeveral places of a Meadow
near the Walls of the City, between
the two Arms of the River, in certain
Furrows, whence it ſprings, and runs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
one of the Channels. This Water
being newly ſprung out of the Earth, hath
the Propriety of extracting a Tincture
from Galls; but there are other Furrows,
where the Water having no Courſe, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
by ſtanding in the Air, this Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And becauſe in all the Ditches newly
made in this Meadow, there is found
Water having the ſame Taſte, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame effect with Galls, and
that in ſome places of the Cauſſey which
ſeparateth the Channel of the River
from the Meadow, there runs a Water
which hath alſo this Propriety of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
a Tincture from Galls, it hath
been judg'd that all the Water of the
Meadow comes from this River, and
that it takes a Mineral Quality in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
thro this Earth, which renders it
wholeſom and proper for the Cure of
many Diſeaſes; and that this Water
may be ſo much the better, foraſmuch
as being before expos'd to the Air in the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40888:54"/>
Channel of the River, it hath not that
Crudity which thoſe Waters have which
proceed from deep Earths and Rocks.</p>
               <p>Whether its Mineral Quality be taken
from the Earth of this Meadow, it were
poſſible to diſcover ſomwhat by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on this Earth, obſerv'd as well
in its Surface as at bottom, if the
ſoaking thro of the Water of the River
hindereth not the ſearch.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Spa.</note>This Water of <hi>Spa,</hi> brought into
<hi>France,</hi> for the Uſe of the Queen about
the end of Summer, and ſent to the
Laboratory of the King's Library, to
be examin'd, was in four Bottles; one
whereof was but half-full, having been
ill ſtop't and the Water run out. The
Water of this Bottle was a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
and altho it was ſtill of a Taſte
moderately inclining to ſomewhat Aigre
and Vinous, it tinctur'd not with Galls.
The Water of the other three Bottles,
which had been well ſtopt and were full,
was very Limpid and of a Taſte ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
Aigre and Vinous. It took a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim</hi>
Colour with Galls.</p>
               <p>Being mixt with the Diſſolution of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40888:54"/>
Mercury Sublimate made in Common
Water, it troubled and rendred it Milky;
and mixt with the Diſſolution of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Vitriol likewiſe made in Water, it
troubled that alſo, and in a little time
there was made a Precipitation of Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh,
ſubtil Earth; as do thoſe Waters
wherein there is a Sulphurous Salt. The
Acidity of this Water hindereth it not
from troubling and precipitating Salt
of Lead diſſolv'd in Common Water:
It made the Tincture of Tourneſole to
turn little Red, which a leſs Acidity tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
much: Which gives occaſion to judg
that the Acidity of this Water is not Simple.</p>
               <p>Being put to diſtil by a very gentle
heat in a high Glaſs-Alembic, to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the more Volatile and Subtil part,
what paſs'd firſt was not found different
from what followed and what remain'd
in the Cucurbite ceaſing Diſtillation,
after having drawn about 1/4; neither
was there any Acidity in the whole Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
What remain'd in the Cucurbit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been put in an Earthen Veſſel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
warm Aſhes to evaporate gently, in
order to obſerve whether there were
made any Concretions during Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40888:55"/>
this Water remain'd always
Limpid; and when there were no more
than two Ounces in the Veſſel, there
were made new Eſſays, to know the
Quality of the Salt therein, by putting
a little of this Water as well in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of Mercury Sublimate made in
Common Water, which it troubled and
made Milky, as on that of <hi>German</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
which it alſo troubled with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Precipitation of Ruddiſh Earth,
and alſo on Syrup of Violets, which
became Green. All which Effects were
Proofs of a Sulphurous Salt, confirming
thoſe drawn from the former Eſſays.</p>
               <p>The Veſſel wherein the Evaporation
was made, was found lin'd in its upper
part near the edge, and all about, with a
Saline Concretion, and lower toward the
bottom it was lin'd with a Yellowiſh Earth
almoſt Inſipid, but a little Reſtringent.</p>
               <p>The Evaporation being finiſh'd,
there remain'd of the whole Quantity of
this Water, which was <abbr>lb</abbr> vij. ℥vj. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vj.
an Earthy and ſomewhat Saline Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

whereof 3/4 were a Light, Subtil, Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh

Salt, which caus'd Mercury Sublimate
to precipitate of a White Colour, as
doth the Salt of Marle, and alſo the
Volatile Salts of Plants and Animals,
and not of a Red or Orange Colour, as
do the true Nitres and Alcalies. This Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity
would have oblig'd us to have

               <p>THe great Quantity of Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which Phyſicians cauſe them
to drink, to whom they preſcribe the Uſe
thereof, for the Cure of ſome Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Diſeaſes, which yield not to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

that the Principal Effect which they

conſiderable, becauſe the moſt part of
Chronical Diſeaſes proceed from the
Obſtruction of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> which this
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40888:56"/>
great Quantity of Drink may reſolve.
The Eaſe, which many Patients receive,
is the reaſon why few Phyſicians give
themſelves the trouble of ſearching the
particular Qualities of theſe Waters;
which are nevertheleſs very different,
and conſiderable enough to deſerve In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
in order to make the better uſe
of them, according to the Diverſity of
Diſeaſes, and the different Conſtitution
of the Diſeaſed.</p>
               <p>'Tis eaſy to judge that all Waters of
Running Springs; ſuch as are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Waters which are us'd in Phyſic,
may have particular different Qualities;
if it be conſidered, that ſome of theſe
Waters come from Places near the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the Earth, others from certain
Places more Deep. Thoſe which have
not been able to penetrate further, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of Beds of Stone, or Fat Earth,
which happen underneath, reſt on this
ſort of Bottoms, and run out only
where they find any Paſſages. They
have their Originals either from the
fall of Rain-Waters, or by the Percola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Waters of Rivers and Lakes,
or of the Sea, thro the Neighbouring
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40888:56"/>
Earths, or thoſe which they can reach;
and in traverſing theſe Earths, which
are leſs compact, they diſſolve the Salts
which are there, and impregnate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with certain Subtil, Earthy Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
which are found by Evaporation.
The Water which comes from Places
more Deep, whither its Weight caus'd
it to fall, according as it could paſs,
cannot riſe again in its Liquid Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
without force; but being rarified
by ſome inward heat of the Earth, it
riſeth in Vapours; afterwards reſuming
its firſt and Natural Liquid Conſiſtence,
by the Cold toward the Surface of the
Earth, in coming forth it produceth
Springs, and alſo little Lakes on the
higheſt Mountains, whither it may very
well riſe, ſince that it mounteth even to
the middle Region of the Air, where
Snow is form'd, and whence Rain falls.
Theſe Waters being rarified in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundities
of the Earth, whence they
riſe, receive eaſily Mixtures of Mineral
Exhalations and Vapours, which are
frequent in theſe Places; but theſe Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
being not often diſtinguiſh'd in
theſe Waters riſing from their Springs,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40888:57"/>
either by Scent or Taſte, cannot be
underſtood but by their Effects; the
Aſſignment whereof to their proper
Cauſes is not always eaſy and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>The Information, which we give
here, of the Salts and Earths of ſeveral
Mineral Waters, will not fully ſatisfie
the Curioſity of thoſe who would be
likewiſe inſtructed concerning the other
Cauſes of the Proprieties of theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
ſince that beſides the mixture of
Concrete ſubſtances found in them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Obſervations here rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
there may alſo be contain'd ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
not Concrete, ſo Subtil and ſo
Volatile, that there can remain nothing
in the Sediments which may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
to differ from the Salts and Earths;
and which is not at all found in what
paſſes by Diſtillation. This Taſte
ſomewhat Aigre or Vinous, which is
loſt in the Air and by Heat, ought to
have for its Subject a Spirituous and moſt
Volatil Subſtance, which it were very
deſirable, were known. The Heat which
ſome have in their Springs, and at co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40888:57"/>
to hot Vapours which are mixt
with them in their Courſe thro Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
Profundities; where the Cold

particular Effects of theſe Waters on
diverſe Subjects, give occaſion to judge
that they are not Pure and Simple.
Wherefore the Academy hath propos'd
to labour, in order to the enquiry of
theſe things, for the Satisfaction of the
Curious and Public Benefit.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Obſervations
of the Salts and Earths of theſe Waters
may ſerve as well in Phyſic as for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic
Arts; to make a judgment of the
fitneſs of ſome of theſe Waters for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
deſign'd Uſes.</p>
               <p>The two Genders of Salts, under
which are rang'd the Salts of thoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whereof hitherto hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
may poſſibly have Differences
which divide each of theſe Genders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſeveral Species; as the Naturaliſts of
the Royal Academy have remark'd in
Salts drawn from the Aſhes of ſeveral
Plants; which have been obſerv'd ſome
to reſemble the true Nitre, others Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt, &amp; to retain the participation of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40888:58"/>
the Specific Proprieties of their Subjects.</p>
               <p>Some of the Earths which are found
together with theſe Salts in the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Mineral Waters evaporated or
diſtill'd, may have particular Uſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Differences. Some
<hi>Germans</hi> have remark'd that the White
Earth of the Mineral Water of <hi>Schwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bach</hi>
is Purgative. They had in the
Academy ſome Bottles of this Water,
the Taſte whereof was Vinous and
Strong. The Salt of its Sediment was
Nitrous, and caus'd Mercury Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
diſſolv'd in Common Water to
precipitate in a<note n="*" place="margin">Naca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</note> deep Crimſon, as do
the Alcalies of Plants. The Earth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from this Sediment was White
as Chalk, but there was not Quantity
enough to make Experiment of its Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Faculty, and we had neglected to
obſerve this in ſeveral like Earths taken
from the Nitrous Waters of this Kingdom.
The true Nitre of the Ancients, being
Sulphurous, and having reſemblance to
the Alcalies of Plants, hath likewiſe this
Propriety, with them, to move by Siege.
And this White Earth which is found
with Nitrous Salts of Mineral Waters
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40888:58"/>
may participate of the ſame Quality,
even as the <hi>Coagulum</hi> of the Salt of
Tartar made by the Second part
of Sal-Marine, retains ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of its Salt, altho it be Inſipid,
and not Diſſoluble in Water, but only
in Acid Liquors, ſuch as is diſtill'd Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naigre,
which diſſolves it with an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcence;
the like whereof hath been
obſerv'd in ſeveral White Earths of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Mineral Waters.</p>
               <p>As to the Obſervation of the Taſts of
the Waters brought to us, we have been
only able to judge, by what hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd
by taſting them at their arrival.
They who are upon the Place of their
Springs may better make a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
particularly in thoſe which are
ſomewhat Aigre and Vinous, the
Taſte whereof is either weakened
or loſt by being kept or expos'd to the
Air. They may alſo better perceive
the Degrees of their Colouring with
Powders of Galls, Oak-leaves, Myro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balans,
Pomegranate-barks, and other
like ſubſtances; and alſo judge more
preciſely of their Conſiſtence and
Weight. The Naturaliſts of the Royal
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40888:59"/>
Academy have not been able to obſerve
exactly all theſe things in the Waters
which have been ſent them from diſtant
Places, and which might have receiv'd
ſeveral Changes as well by Time as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
both in their Taſte and Diſpoſition
to take Colours with certain Subſtances,
and in their Conſiſtence more or leſs Thin
and Subtil. The Method which they
have followed in their Experiments on
the Waters which have been ſent them,
may be ſerviceable to thoſe who will
examine them at their Springs, in order
to gain a more exact knowledg of them.</p>
               <p>This Vaporous Subſtance of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Waters, which are ſomewhat Aigre
and Vinous, is probably the firſt Being
of Mineral Sulphur, and of the Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thence ariſing. There are found
Earths impregnated with this Acid, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous,
Sulphurous Subſtance, from
the Concretion whereof are ſometimes
made Sulphurous and Vitriolic Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.
And for the moſt part there is not
made any Mineral Concretion diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
in theſe Earths, where there is not
found either Mineral Sulphur, or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
or Metal. This Mineral, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40888:59"/>
and Indigeſted Subſtance may
very well be the Principle of Vitriol,
but in its firſt ſtate it cannot be a Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Product, if it be in thoſe Earths where
there is not already ſomewhat of Vitriol.
It is more eaſy to obſerve it in its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts,
when it hath receiv'd ſome Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Concretion. The Humid Air penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into the Mineral Stones, which are
Inſipid, but impregnated with a Mineral
Sulphur, which is eaſily perceiv'd when
'tis diſengag'd by Fire, does manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give to the Taſte a Sulphurous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity,
which before was not ſenſible.
And of the Concrete Sulphur of theſe
Mineral Stones or Marchaſites penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Humid Air, is made a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete,
Vitriolic Juice, which is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of this Mineral Sulphur, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
whereof hath been an Acid and
moſt Vaporous Subſtance. Which alſo
hath been obſerv'd in many Clayie
Earths expos'd to the Air, which diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
into Powder, contracted at firſt
an Acidity more ſenſible to the Noſe than
to the Tongue; afterwards there were
made Sulphurous and Inflammable Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and at length Saline Concretions
which were reduc'd to Vitriol.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:40888:60"/>
This Subtil, Vaporous Subſtance,
Acid, or rather Harſh, produceth not
always Vitriolic Concretions; and it
happens in many Earths that thro de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
of requiſite diſpoſitions it remains
in its firſt Being. Then it is not a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
of Vitriol, and the Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which paſs thro the Earths where
this Subtil Matter is found, and which
contract an Acidity by mixture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
ought not to be call'd Vitriolic.
We have obſerv'd in many Waters im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with this Acid Vapour, that
nevertheleſs there was not found there
any true Vitriol, or any Subſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
Alum, and that the Salt which
remain'd in their Sediments was a Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
ſuch as the Ancients have deſcrib'd,
and which is as far different from Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol
and Alum, as are Alcalies, or fixt
Sulphurous Salts of Plants.</p>
               <p>The Salts, Vitriols, Alums, and other
Concrete Subſtances diſſoluble in
Water, may be ſo mixt with Mineral
Waters, that they may not be much
perceivable except in their Sediments;
but the Sulphurs and Bitumens are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
eaſie to be diſcern'd in the Waters
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40888:60"/>
wherein they are contain'd, becauſe they
either ſettle or ſwim on the Surface, being
not capable of mixture as the Salts. We
have not perceiv'd any in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which have been ſent us. Thoſe
which were the Hotteſt in their Springs
have not ſeem'd to us more Sulphurous
and Bituminous than the others. And
if there is found any Sulphur or Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in their Baſins upon the ſides
of their Receptacles, or in their
Mud, it may be that theſe are not thoſe
Inflammable Subſtances in the Earth
which have rendred them Hot. It is
more probable that they contract this
Heat by the mixture of ſome Hot Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
which they meet with in Deep
places thro which they paſs. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
doth ſufficiently ſhew that no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible
matter takes Fire, or keeps it
long without Air; and that to extinguiſh
the Fire of Sulphurs and Bitumens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd,
it is enough to hinder them
from the Communication of the Air,
by covering well the Veſſels which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
theſe Subſtances. The Sulphurs
which burn in Certain Cavities of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
diſcover'd do not take Fire, but
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40888:61"/>
in thoſe places where they take Air;
and when that which lies open is ſpent,
the Fire ceaſes in what remains cover'd,
altho it be equally Combuſtible. And
if ſome Subſtances take a Fire ſtrong
enough not to be ſtifled under Ground, it
cauſeth what covereth it to crack, to
give it ſelf Vent and take Air, as doth
Powder in Mines.</p>
               <p>If there are not perpetual Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Fires, the Heat of ſome Mineral
Waters, which continue to be Hot in their
Springs, cannot be attributed to them.
It is more probable that there are in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places of the Earth Hot Vapours
and Exhalations, the Heat whereof is
preſerv'd in places Deep and Cloſe,
where the Air doth not penetrate to cool
them, and where theſe ſubſtances Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
have not room enough to diſtend
themſelves more, and ſuffer ſome weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of their Heat, or Diſſipation by
a more great Rarefaction. But the Heat
of theſe Vapours may be augmented by
their preſſing together in Cloſe Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
whereinto they inſinuate themſelves;
and if they meet with Waters running
thro the ſame Paſſages, they may heat
them by mixing with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:40888:61"/>
There have been made ſome Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
which give occaſion to judge
that the Waters of Hot Springs and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Baths are made warm by Hot Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors
which paſs with them.</p>
               <p>I. That theſe Hot Mineral Waters
burn not the Mouth and Tongue of
thoſe who drink of them at their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
forth from their Springs, as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Water heated by Fire to a like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
would do. Which ſeems to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the Subtilty of the Subſtance
which produceth this Heat in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The Flame of Spirit of Wine
burns not the Hand ſo ſtrongly, as that
of a burning Coal.</p>
               <p>II. That the Heat of Mineral Waters
doth not act on ſome tender ſubſtances,
as doth that of Common Water rais'd by
Fire to the ſame Degree; for it hath
been ſeen that Dock-Leaves, which
were ſoftned and boyl'd eaſily enough
in Common Water, moderately heated
on the Fire, did not ſoften in the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Waters of <hi>Neris</hi> in <hi>Bourbonnois,</hi>
which are the Hotteſt in <hi>France,</hi> and
which are rendred difficult to drink by
the exceſs of their Heat; but theſe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40888:62"/>
Leaves only chang'd Colour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Yellowiſh, like dead dry'd Leaves.
Which gives occaſion to judge that this
Heat proceeds from ſome Vapour or
Exhalation different from Water, and
more proper to dry than to ſoften, as
doth Common Water, which humects.</p>
               <p>III. That theſe Waters are more Hot
in their Springs by Night than by
Day. Which may be caus'd by the
Cool of the Air, which hindereth the
Diſſipation of the Hot Vapours and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations
which are mixt with them.</p>
               <p>IV. That theſe Waters being expos'd
to the Air, from out their Springs,
cool'd not ſo ſoon as doth Common
Water heated by Fire. Becauſe the
Cold Air, which maketh the Motion
excited by the Fire in Common Water
ſoon to ceaſe, keeps in the Hot Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
which warm the Mineral Waters
by their mixture, and hindereth them
from diſperſing ſo ſoon.</p>
               <p>V. That Hot Mineral Waters have
no more Diſpoſition to Boyl on the Fire
than Common Cold Waters, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as much time requir'd to cauſe the
one to boyl as the other. Which clearly
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40888:62"/>
ſhews that the Heat which Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
contract in the Earth, proceeds not
from a Motion of their Particles excited
by any Subterraneous Fire; for this
Motion being continued and augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Fire of a Chimney or Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
would cauſe them to boyl ſooner
than thoſe which being Cold have not
that Diſpoſition by a Motion Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd.
Wherefore the Heat of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Waters proceeds from certain
Warm Vapours or Exhalations mingled
with them, which the Fire drives away
before they can boyl thereon.</p>
               <p>If there is without Fire in the Earth,
any Heat ſtrong enough to warm the
Waters of ſome Springs, it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
be that this Heat, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to Waters which are Warm
from ſome Thouſands of Years, and
perhaps have ever been ſo, in order
to perpetuate ſelf, keeps in Deep
places, and far diſtant from the Surface
of the Earth, where the Air which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſeth
that, might weaken it by its
Cold, which ſeems to be the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme.
According to this ſuppoſition,
the Difference of Waters of Hot and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40888:63"/>
Cold Springs, whereof ſome are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
to make like Sediments, and to
have Salts of the ſame Species, ſhould
proceed from this, that theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
paſs in the Earth thro Places
more or leſs Deep. We obſerve that
Waters which run on the Surface
of the Earth are Cold, unleſs warm'd by
the Sun, and we find not any Heat
very manifeſt in the parts of the Earth
which are not very Deep: Which gives
occaſion to judge that what there is of
Heat remarkable in the Earth, ought
to be plac'd far therein.</p>
               <p>It is not eaſy to comprehend the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of theſe Vapours or Exhalations
which mix with Mineral Waters and
warm them. It ſeems not neceſſary
that they ſhould be all Bituminous or
Sulphurous, tho ſome are ſuch. At
<hi>Ain la Chapelle</hi> are found Flowers of
Sulphur rais'd upon the Walls of Hot
Springs which are there; and in the
Burning Fountain of <hi>Dauphiné</hi> is ſeen a
Flame which Iſſues forth with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and which probably was not Flame
under the Earth, where it had not Air
enough to burn, and ſcarcely the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40888:63"/>
which iſſues forth with it is heated.
But in many other Springs of Hot Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Waters there is nothing ſeen either
Sulphurous or Inflammable. There
are many other Subſtances which are
heated without taking Fire, the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
whereof mix with Hot Mineral
Waters, but their Qualities are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
but by the effects which they
produce.</p>
               <p>The Royal Academy of the Sciences
has not had Opportunities to obſerve
the divers Effects of Mineral Waters,
as well Hot, as Tepid and Cold, by
employing them to different Uſes. The
Obſervations of the Effects of theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
on Perſons who uſe them in Drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
Bathing, Pumping, Waſhing,
Embrocation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are reſerv'd for the
Phyſicians, whoſe Duty it is to know
the Particular Conſtitutions of thoſe
Perſons, and the State of their Health
Declining or Improving. As for the
Uſes in Mechanical Arts, it may be
eaſy to remark what one or other ſorts
of theſe Waters can do, in the ſteeping of
Hemp, whitening of Linnen, dying of
Wool and Silk, dreſſing of Leather,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40888:64"/>
tempering of Iron, boyling of Peaſe
and ſuch like, watering of Plants, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of Cattle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Obſervations, concerning
the different Weights and Conſiſtences
of Mineral Waters, they may be better
made on the Places of their Springs,
where they are not yet alter'd, either in
Compoſition or Conſiſtence; which
they certainly are, being carried and
kept, having loſt ſome part of thoſe
Vaporous ſubſtances which being mixt
with them, made their Conſiſtence more
Thin and Subtil; or having contracted
ſome Corruption which hath rendred
them more Thick and almoſt Mucila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous;
or having made a Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome Mineral Earthineſs, which
being imperceptibly mixt with them,
renders them leſs Subtil, and which is
not ordinarily ſeparated when they are
drunk freſh, at which time they are
judg'd more efficacious than when they
are kept.</p>
               <p>The Inſtruments us'd by the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to obſerve the Weight and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
of Liquors, were the Araiometre
and the Compound Balance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:40888:64"/>
The Araiometre is a little hollow
Globe of Glaſs, having in its bottom a
ſmall Cavity to contain ſo much Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver
as is neceſſary to make this Globe
ſink in the Liquor wherein it may be
put. In its upper part is a little Pipe an
Inch long; and at the end of this Pipe
there is a ſmall Scale to receive the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted
Weights, which cauſe it to ſink in
different Liquors to a certain Mark made
in the middle of this Pipe. By this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
put in ſeveral Liquors is found
not onely whether their Conſiſtence be
different, but alſo how much the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is, by the Obſervation of the Weight
of the Inſtrument, and of that which is put
in the Scale, to make it ſink equally in
divers Liquors.</p>
               <p>The Compound Balance is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Balance, moving eaſily, and very
exact; to one of the Scales whereof is
hung by ſome Horſe-hairs a Cylinder of
Tin or Leton well poliſh'd, having
about four Inches Height and as much
Diametre, to be able to take up in the
Water the ſpace which a Pint of Liquor
of <hi>Paris</hi> Meaſure would take, and of
ſuch a weight that it may ſink in all ſorts
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40888:65"/>
of Waters. This Cylinder being put
in the Water the Weight and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
whereof is to be obſerv'd, there is
put in the other oppoſite Scale of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
ſo much weight as is neceſſary to
keep the two Scales Equipois'd; and
according to the difference of Weight,
which is requiſite to keep this equal Poiſe
in divers Waters, judgment may be
made of the difference of their Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
and Weight in like Quantity.
And to know what is the Weight of this
Quantity of Water which the Cylinder
takes up, the Weight put in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
Scale is to be ſubſtracted from
that of the Cylinder. This may be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd
on Mineral Waters taken at their
Springs, and preſently examin'd.</p>
               <p>The like Obſervations may be made
on Common Waters, in ordinary Uſe,
as well for drinking, as dreſſing of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals,
to the end that by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their Properties judgment may
be made what they contribute towards
Health. Theſe Waters, ordinarily call'd
Common, in diſtinction from Mineral,
being not altogether Pure and Simple,
may have acquir'd divers Proprieties
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40888:65"/>
by the diverſity of Mixtures which in
them are made, either in the Air or Earth.
And altho they contain none of thoſe
Species of Minerals which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to the middle Mineral or Metallic
Gender, the participation whereof gives
the Name of Mineral to thoſe Waters
which are impregnated therewith; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
they have ſomething Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:
for the Salts and Earths, which are
always mixt with them, are Mineral
Productions. And in the moſt part of
the Waters ſent for Mineral, whereon
the Obſervations made in the Royal
Academy are here related, there was
found only Salt and Earth in different
Proportions. The diſtinction between
the Waters of this ſort which are us'd
only medicinally, and thoſe which
are commonly made Uſe of in order to
Aliment, depending only upon More
or Leſs of theſe mixtures. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Waters, which are eſteem'd the beſt,
are the moſt Subtil, Light, and leſs Mixt.</p>
