            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THere having been a great Defection from true <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in the long Night of Apoſtacy, whereby groſs Darkneſs hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the Nations, foretold by the Apoſtles, That Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, Deceivers, grievous Wolves, falſe Teachers, <hi>Core</hi>-like, falſe Worſhippers ſhould enſue; theſe uſhered in the Apoſtacy (which began in the Apoſtles dayes) and grew ſo great that they became Perſecutors of the True <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as indeed falſe Worſhip and Perſecution are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Companions: For <hi>John,</hi> by the Revelation of God to him, ſaw the Beaſt (which the Dragon had given his Power unto, after he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Woman which fled into, and was fed in the Wilderneſs 1260. dayes, and the Man-Child caught up to God) ſet up his Worſhip, and compelling thereto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the falſe Prophet deceiving them that had wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the Image of the Beaſt: And he alſo ſaw the great Whore ſitting upon the Beaſt, which was to be worſhipped forty two Moneths, having a Golden Cup in her hand, wherewith ſhe deceived, and by her Sorceries enticed the Nations to commit Fornication with her; and ſo corrupted the Earth, and made her ſelf drunk with the Blood of the Saints, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of Jeſus, &amp;c. Hereby <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the Spirit the great and long Sufferings of the true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the Church and People of God in the time of the Apoſtacy, by the falſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> the falſe Worſhippers, who having loſt the Power and Spirit, by which the Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians were led and guided how to worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth, ſet up fair and gilded Forms of Worſhip (<hi>Jeroboam</hi>-like) of their own making and inventing; and at length, loſt not only the Power, but the very Form of Truth and true worſhip; and then (being in the Enmity) did compel to their Worſhip, and (<hi>Cain</hi>-like) perſecuted to Death the true Worſhippers, the true Church and people of God; witneſs ſeveral Hiſtories of the <hi>Papal</hi> Perſecution of the true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Countries where the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> extended it ſelf, and ſo
<pb facs="tcp:99854:3"/>
continues in many places to this Day. And how can we do leſs then charge the riſe of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (ſo called) perſecuting for Religion to proceed thence; <q>For they were the firſt Authors<note place="margin">Dr. Taylor late Biſhop of Down &amp; Derry.</note> of Force and Vioience in matters of Faith and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in Religion amongſt Chriſtians; the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition being chiefly entruſted to the Order of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick who firſt preached this Force, and by whoſe means many true Chriſtians were put to Death, for not abjuring their Principles and true Faith in Religion: and this was the firſt Example of putting Erring Perſons to Death in the Church of Rome; for Chriſtianity doth not puniſh Corporally, people for erring Spiritually, but indeed Popery doth.</q> And of the ſame mind were divers ancient and modern Writes, who ſaid, <q>That people muſt be enformed to embrace Religion<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. Tertul. Haywar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus. K. James.</note> with Reaſon, and not compelled by Violence; for nothing violent or injurious can be Religious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Reaſon, and not Force, ought to convince. That God never loves to plant his Church by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Blood; the Condition of Chriſtians being rather to be perſecuted, then to perſecute.</q> 
               <q>What Cruelty among Chriſtians is acted under the colour<note place="margin">K. Car. 1.</note> of Religion, as if we could not be Chriſtians unleſs we crucifie one another?</q> And by Compulſion no man can make a a Hypocrite to be a true Believer; but on the contrary, many may be made Hypocrites: For people in the Matters of Religion and Worſhip of God, ſhould rather be drawn by the Spirit of the Lord in God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then driven by the Terrors of Magiſtrates, or forced by the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Puniſhments of outward Laws of Men: And how can that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Worſhip be acceptable to God, which for its Authority hath only the Force and Fear of Man, without the Faith and Fear of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> alſo ſaw the Whore, the Mother of Harlots, judged, and the downfall of her Pride, and the Merchants of the Earth (that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by Trading and Trafficking with her) lamenting her Fall, and the Man-Child come to rule the Nations with a Rod of Iron, ſmiting them with the Sword of his Mouth; and the holy City, new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (the Mother of us all) diſcending out of Heaven from God, prepared as a Bride for her Husband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in this Holy City there was no Temple, the Lord God and the Lamb being the Temple of it, and the Lamb
<pb facs="tcp:99854:3"/>
the Light thereof, and the Nations of them that are ſaved ſhall walk in the Light of it, &amp;c. Here <hi>John</hi> the Divine had a Sight of the reſtoring of the true Church to its primitive Purity and Inſtitution, in Faith, Worſhip, Diſcipline and all Goſpel-Order.</p>
            <p>And now the Day of God's great Love and rich Mercy to Mankind is dawned again, after the long Night of Apoſtacy, ſince the Apoſtles dayes, and the Everlaſting Goſpel is preached again, and he that made Heaven and Earth is to be Worſhipped again in Spirit and in Truth; and many are turned from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan and the Dragon's worſhip unto God; and the Church is returning out of the Wilderneſs, and making her ſelf ready for the Marriage of the Lamb; an Invitation to the Supper is proclaimed, and the Way to the Holy City diſcovered: And it having pleaſed God to bring us forth in this Bleſſed Day and Happy Age, wherein the true Light hath appeared, in which we have believed, and are turned thereto, by which we are come to ſee the firſt day's Work of God's new Creation, Light ſeparated from Darkneſs, and to ſee over and beyond this long and thick dark Night, to God's Day, the Light that manifeſts Sin, the Deeds of Darkneſs, the Works of the Devil; and hereby we are come to the Foundation Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple again of many Generations, and to the true Religion, to ſee and know the true Worſhip of the primitive Chriſtians again, &amp; ſo to be led out of all By-wayes, Will-worſhip, Rudiments, Traditions and Preſciptions of men, to Worſhip God aright, which is in the Spirit and in the Truth, which Chriſt Jeſus ſet up above 1600 years ago; for we are of and for the ſame Faith, Worſhip, Church and Goſpel-Order of the antient true <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> for which we are now perſecuted, as they were in former dayes: And indeed it hath been our Portion to ſuffer (ever ſince the Lord God firſt raiſed us up to bear Teſtimony to his Everlaſting Truth, the Light, Chriſt Jeſus, that lighteth every Man that cometh into the World, that through it they might believe, and to own his true and living Worſhip, which is in Spirit and in Truth) and to endure not only Reproaches, bitter Taunts, Mockings and Revilings; but alſo, Cruel and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian-like <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages, by Halings, Tearings, Beatings, Whippings, Woundings, long Impriſonments great Fines, exceſſive Loſs and Havock of our Goods, and ſometimes Loſs of Life, occaſioned (moſtly) by the Prieſts, (whoſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize we can no longer buy) and their incenſing the Magiſtrates againſt us, falſly accuſing us, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Faelix,</hi> to be Movers of Sedition, and raiſing new Sects: ſo that as it was accounted a Crime
<pb facs="tcp:99854:4"/>
then with the <hi>Jews,</hi> to be called <hi>a Chriſtian, a Follower of Jeſus of Nazareth;</hi> even ſo now is made matter enough againſt us (by ſome ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) to be called <hi>a Quaker,</hi> (a tearm given us in Deriſion, firſt by an <hi>Independant</hi> Juſtice at <hi>Derby</hi> about 20 years ago) and for no other cauſe have ſeveral ſuffer'd. Neither have we in this Realm ſuffered for theſe laſt 11 Years only, but before, even in the former Powers time, the which hath been already publiſhed; and we have found that the moſt and worſt of our Sufferings ſince the King's Reſtauration, have bin by ſuch of the Profeſſing Prieſts and Magiſtrates, that were in Favour, or at leaſtwiſe made uſe of in <hi>Oliver</hi> and his Son <hi>Richard's</hi> dayes, and are now wheeled about, and for Profit or Honour have cringed and conformed to theſe Times; though we cannot but own and acknowledge, that upon Applications and Addreſſes, made by us to the chief Rulers of this Land, in behalf of our ſuffering Friends, they have divers times been pleaſed to grant us Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Redreſs. And ſeeing we hold or maintain no Principle of Religion, or Practice of Worſhip, or Doctrine of the Goſpel, but what is according to the Scriptures of Truth, why will any profeſſing <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute us? And we can truly appeal to God the Searcher of all Hearts, that according to our Principles, ſo our Practiſes have alwayes been, even to ſeek Peace, and enſue it, and to follow after the Knowledge of God, and to deſire the Good and Welfare of all: Where have we wronged any mans <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Poſſeſſion?</hi> or been found in Plots, or guilty of Sedition? or, Have we made Reſiſtance when men (yea, unreaſonable men) with Clubs, Swords and Staves, and other illegal wayes, have wronged, beat, cut and abuſed us, which was no Honour to Manhood, to exerciſe ſuch ſeverity and Cruelty upon ſuch an Innocent and Harmleſs People, that will not lift up a hand againſt them; and wherein we could not (actively) obey for Conſcience ſake in matters relating to Religion and our Principles, there we have (paſſively) ſuffered, and patiently born it? Have we not all along been a Suffering People, and yet not for any Cauſe of Evil doing, that could juſtly be laid to our charge; but for things pertaining to our Principles, and the Worſhip of God, and in Obedience to his Requirings of us; for which Cauſe we can more freely give up our Bodies a Sacrifice, then to diſobey the <hi>Lord God of Heaven and Earth,</hi> who having kept us Innocent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will plead for us againſt our Cauſleſs Perſecutors, who have no more againſt us, then was againſt <hi>Daniel?</hi> Hath not long Experience of us under ſeveral Governments and diſtinct Powers (ſince we were a People to God) fully and (to any moderate man) ſufficiently evidenced
<pb facs="tcp:99854:4"/>
our Innocency, and that our Deportment (notwithſtanding the many and great Provocations) have been peaceable and harmleſs in the exerciſe of our Conſciences in Religion and the Worſhip of God (touching which we our ſelves, and none elſe for us, muſt give an account to God) let our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and the whole Nation bare teſtimony, and the juſt Witneſs of God in men judge, and Conſcience ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether our Principles have produced any other Practice then as aforeſaid, or our Practices any other Effects in our Converſation, then ſuch as become an in-offenſive and well-minded People, profeſſing Truth and Honeſty: Well then, What man, as a man, much more as a good man, profeſſing <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> will have a hand in perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Innocent People of God? or who will joyn with curſed <hi>Cain</hi> (the firſt Perſecutor on Earth) to perſecute his Righteous Brother <hi>Abel</hi> about Worſhip? Is it not contrary to the Character of a good <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and againſt the Royal Law of God, to impoſe upon another in the things of Religion and worſhip of God, contrary to the Faith of the Impoſed? or would the Impoſer be impoſed upon contrary to his own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the ſpiritual concernments of his ſoul, ſeeing that every man muſt anſwer for himſelf, &amp; that none can give to God a Ranſom for his Brothers ſoul: therefore we warn all in love, to take heed what they do herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for its a tender Cauſe, and its the Juriſdiction of the Lord, his Sovereignty and proper Dominion, and alone belongs to him to rule in the Conſciences of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in order to be ſerved and worſhipped acceptably.</p>
            <p>And to the end Reader thou mayſt be inform'd of the manner of our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and the cauſe thereof, we have collected ſome part of what we have ſuffered for theſe laſt 11 years, that thou mayſt ſee how, where, and for what (ſometimes without and contrary to Law, and ſometimes under colour of Law) much Havock hath bin made of our Goods; which we here put to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view in a plain way and manner, for we are a plain people; we have no need to uſe Arguments to perſwade thee to credit the truth of this enſuing Relation, it being ſo obvious and generally known in Cities, Towns &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where we are converſant. And though ſome of them may ſeem ſmall in thine eyes, yet we would not have thee too ſleightly diſeſteem thereof, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the leaſt of them is for matter of Conſcience, and therefore ought to be tendred by all profeſſing <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in Truth and Sincerity; of which number we wiſh thee no worſe then to be one, and then thou canſt not but reckon us two thy Friends,</p>

                  <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to anſwer the End for which we were created, that is, To glorifie God, and to keep our ſelves unſpotted of the Word, which is pure Religion, <hi>Ja.</hi> 1. 27. And thus by Faith was God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp'd before the Law, from <hi>Adam</hi> till <hi>Moſes;</hi> for God having made man in his own Image, capable to ſerve and obey him, and to enjoy his bleſſed Preſence; but man by Tranſgreſſion loſt his Place and happy Eſtate, and ſo was drove out from God, yet not without a Promiſe of the Seed (Chriſt) to bruiſe the Serpent's head; and though thus expelled, yet was it his Duty to Serve, Fear and Worſhip the Lord God his Creator, as apppears by the practice of <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Sons, who worſhipped God by offering Sacrifices each of them according to the perſwaſion of their Hearts and Underſtandings; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Cain</hi> (the firſt Birth) offered the Fruit of the Ground; <hi>Abel</hi> (the ſecond Birth) of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Firſtlings of his Flock, and the Fat thereof, and he, and his Offering, or Worſhip was accepted; but unto <hi>Cain</hi> God had no reſpect, as offering from that which was curſed; and he not finding Acceptance with God in his ſaid Service, then Envy and Wrath aroſe in him, and he Murthered his Innocent Brother.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe its our Duty ſo to meet to ſeek and worſhip God, who is worthy to be ſought unto, and waited on, by all that make Profeſſion of him, as tending to the Honour of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name, and Advancement of his Bleſſed Truth, and to the Benefit and Comfort of our own Souls, as appears by the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Saints of old, who feared the Lord, and ſpake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened, and heard, and a Book of Remembrance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord, and thought upon his Name; <hi>And they ſhall be mine in that day</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>when I make up my Jewels,</hi> Mal. 3. 16, 17. So that in conſideration of the Omnipotency of God, who (as we are his Creatures, much more his People that fear him, and his Children that believe in him) doth expect our continual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on him, as being ready to hear and anſwer our breathing Deſires, and to ſupply us with every Good Thing needful for us, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 25, 26. We have good Grounds thus to wait and meet, 1ſt, From the Promiſe of Chriſt Jeſus, who ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there will I be in the midſt of them;</hi> and we have found him faithful that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, read <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. to 12. 2dly, From the Command of Chriſt to his Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4. whoſe Duty it was to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God for further Manifeſtation of his Mind and Will; for though they had heard Chriſt's Divine Doctrine, ſeen his Marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Miracles, and been long converſant with him in the Fleſh; yet mark what he ſaid unto them, when he was to leave them, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 11. for he (as in the Fleſh) was not alwayes to ſtay with them, which they were ignorant of) <hi>Its expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; and when the Comforter (the Spirit of Truth) is come, he will guide you</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:99854:28"/>
                  <hi>into all Truth, and will dwell with you, and ſhall be in you, and ſhall teach you all things, and abide with you forever,</hi> Joh. 14. 2, 3, 16, to 27. (Mark here, the Spirit was to be their Rule or Guide, and their Teacher in all things) Yet after his Reſurrection, they being aſſembled and met together, were commanded not to depart from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but to wait there for the Promiſe of the Father, or (as <hi>Luke</hi> writes, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 32, 45, 49.) until they were endued with Power from on High, which ſhould open their Underſtandings, to underſtand the Scriptures, and the Myſteries of God's Kingdom, which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſt was fulfilled, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. for the Comforter, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, did come upon them at their Meeting at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to lead them into all Truth, according to Chriſt's Promiſe: Here thou mayſt ſee that the very Apoſtles, who had the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as we have) and had been ſo long with Chriſt, yet they had not learned all things, nor underſtood they the Scriptures then (no more then they are now) till the Spirit enlightened and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Well then, Have not we great need now to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and wait for Chriſt's fulfilling this Promiſe to us, to be taught all things, that we may underſtand the Scriptures, which are as a Book ſealed from all thoſe that are not led by the Meaſure of God's Spirit (which we do Witneſs) which only can open them (they being not of any private Interpretation) 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20, 21. And therefore the Apoſtle enjoyns the converted <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> To hold faſt the Profeſſion of their Faith without wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and not to forſake the Aſſembling of themſelves together, as the manner of ſome was; but exhort one another, and ſo much the more as the day approaches, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 23, 24, 25. And we are of the ſame Faith and Principle, and therefore we cannot but meet together, and exhort one another, as an Expreſſion of our Duty, and thereby we make Confeſſion to the Truth, by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt our Profeſſion thereof; and we dare not forſake our thus aſſembling in the Service and Worſhip of God, as the manner of ſome then was, and now is who for fear loſe the Teſtimony of their Profeſſion, creeping into Corners, and ſheltring from the Storms; pleading Policy to <hi>forbear, and not give Offence, &amp;c.</hi> But our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion being grounded on the Foundation Principle of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Light, Chriſt Jeſus, we are made willing (by the good and comfortable Effects we have received by our ſaid Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99854:28"/>
and Waitings upon God (having often in our Aſſemblies felt and enjoyed God's heavenly Life and bleſſed Preſence, to the great Refreſhment of our Souls) and encouraged to continue conſtant in this Practice without being afraid or aſhamed, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74, 75. (having ſuch Divine Authority for our ſo doing) though Sufferings (even to the loſs of all outwardly) ſhould attend us. And our Duty herein is confirmed from the Practice of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and his bleſſed Apoſtles and Diſciples, and alſo the primitive <hi>Chriſtians, (Acts</hi> 2. 41, 42, to the end) who, as faſt as they were convinced and gathered out of all other Worſhips (whether Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional or particular Sects) did thus aſſemble, or meet together, in Houſes, Fields, &amp;c. though the Laws of the Lands, or Power of the chief Rulers, did neither tollerate nor encourage them, but rather edict to the contrary; yet they did neither deſiſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline Meetings, knowing it be their Duties, and having found the vertue thereof by Chriſt's Promiſe fulfilled to them in &amp; at their Waitings upon God, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. And our Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors may as well ſay, That Chriſt, his Apoſtles, Diſciples &amp; primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians were diſſobedient to the then chief Authority, in not deſiſting or declining preaching the Truth, or meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Name of Jeſus, as Perſecute us for the like now? <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 28, 29, 42.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As the Spirit of God, Scripture Authority, and the Practice of the Saints, Chriſt, his Diſciples and primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> do juſtifie our thus meeting; ſo now let us a little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with men, who (if guided by Reaſon) cannot but witneſs for us, to the Innocency of our Sufferings, for this Duty and Practice of our thus meeting to wait upon and worſhip God: And can any one called a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> (if moderate) ſay, <hi>That its a</hi> Crime <hi>to meet to worſhip God?</hi> if not, then our meeting for that end is juſt and lawful; neither are our Aſſemblies prejuditial to any: What Evil Act was ever found amongſt us at our ſaid Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? What Conſpiracies can there be in a Silent Meeting? or, what Deſign can be contrived in a mixt Multitude, where the Doors are open for any to come in, to hear or ſee what is ſaid or done? or What ill Effects or bad Conſequences to the Government in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral (either in the former, or this preſent Powers time) or to any
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99854:29"/>
Perſon in particular have our ſaid Meetings produced? have not both our Principles and Practices ſufficiently evidenced our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency herein? let our Neighbours, and all that know us give their Teſtimony in this caſe. And indeed, if Reaſon rule men (as it ought) then (upon a ſtrict ſcrutiny into this thing) there will be no Ground or Foundation (<hi>in rerum natura</hi>) for any Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of us, who are but a few, mean, innocent People, that fear the Living God, and are not ſeeking a Kingdom or Power below; but a City, whoſe Maker and Builder is God; and Power againſt our inward and ſpiritual Enemies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 10, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 29, 30. Or can any ingenious or unbyaſed men truely ſay, <hi>That they are</hi> (re vera) <hi>in any Terror of our ſaid Meetings, or really in fear that any thing</hi> (in ſuch an open and mixt Multitude) <hi>can be deſigned to the prejudice of the preſent Powers, or Peace of the Country;</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>all this diſturbing our peaceable Meetings, and perſecuting us for the ſame, proceeds</hi> (moſtly) <hi>from ſuch profeſſing Prieſts and Magiſtrates</hi> (without the Poſſeſſion) <hi>who</hi> (that they may appear to run pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel with the high Tides of the Times, and to ſwim ſwiftly with the Streams of the Seaſons, thereby to ingratiate themſelves) <hi>are forward to perſecute us, becauſe we cannot change and conform</hi> (as they do) <hi>contrary to our Conſciences?</hi> And beſides, ſeeing every man muſt render an account to God for himſelf, how then will it ſerve, or, who will ſtand betwixt God and a mans Soul, if the man hath acted contrary to his own Underſtanding and Conſcience? Can Prieſt or Magiſtrate then plead for, or be heard againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience it ſelf (which is more then a Thouſand Witneſſes) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Guilty Soul before God? or, Would our Perſecutors be compelled to a Worſhip contrary to their own Conſciences? So that let our Perſecutors pretend what they will or can, it is evidently matter of Conſcience, rightly informed and ſurely grounded, even God's Spirit, Scripture Authority, and the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Saints and primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that makes us thus meet, and wait upon, and worſhip God, and ſuffer thus for the ſame.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Touching our not paying <hi>Tythes</hi> and <hi>Maintenance</hi> to the Prieſts and their Clarks, we have good Ground for the ſame. <hi>For,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> BEfore the Law <hi>Abraham</hi> was the firſt (we read of) who having reſcued his Brother <hi>Lot,</hi> by force of Arms, from the four vanquiſhed Kings, gave the Tenth of the Spoil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Milchizedeck,</hi> Prieſt of the moſt High God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 20. Here the Original of Tythes was a free Gift, and not a general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; for then all Princes ſhould have paid the Tenth of their Spoils. And <hi>Jacob</hi> alſo vowed the giving of the Tenths unto God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Under the Law, Tythes were ordained of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 29. for the <hi>Levite,</hi> Strangers, Widdows and Fatherleſs; and they were to be brought into God's Store-houſe, to be diſpenced to the <hi>Levite,</hi> (who had no Inheritance with his Brethren) and Prieſthood) for their continual attendance about the Alter, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, Offerings, &amp;c. <hi>Num.</hi> 18. 24. And the with-holding of Tythes, or the not duly paying of them, on this account, was no leſs then a Robbery done to God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3, 8, 9, 10. (and incurred a Curſe, and not Impriſonment to Death, as they do now, who ſet them up without Command from Chriſt) who ordained them (amongſt other things) holy, and were to continue in force as long as the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſthood, Law, and the Ordinances thereof laſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But when the fulneſs of time was, that the Meſſiah Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4.) came, of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> Propheſied, ſaying, <hi>Him ſhall you hear in all things;</hi> and whom the Prieſts and <hi>Jews</hi> (by the Scriptures) profeſſed ſhould come, yet when he came, they believed not in his then appearance in the Fleſh, no more then the literal Profeſſors of this Age can believe in his now Spiritual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, (<hi>Rom</hi> 10. 16. 21.) And Chriſt Jeſus did chuſe Apoſtles out of the Diſciples that believed in him, who were of ſeveral Tribes, and not out of the Prieſts, or Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> only, and he ordain'd them &amp; more Diſciples, and gave them Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99854:30"/>
and ſent them forth to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 13. &amp; chap. 9. from 1. to 8. &amp; chap. 10. from 1. to 10. Here was neither Paper nor Parchment Commiſſion, nor their Authority to preach derived from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rulers or <hi>Roman</hi> Power: and for this their Goſpel Miſſion and Preaching he inſtituted and appointed them a Goſpel Maintenance, ſuitable to their Goſpel Diſpenſation Miniſtry, read <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. &amp; 10. where Chriſt (giving the verbal Commiſſion to the Goſpel Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers) ſaith, <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give; provide neither Silver, Gold, Braſs, Scrip nor Bread for your Journey; ſalute no man by the way; the Workman is worthy of his Meat; and into what Town or City ſoever ye enter, enquire who is worthy, &amp;c.</hi> And after they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their Service, and returned to Chriſt, they rejoyced, they complained not of a hard Maſter, or hard Commiſſion, or of want in their Goſpel Service of Preaching and Journeys, neither asked they for any Augmentation; for they lacked nothing, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 35.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99854:30"/>
                  <hi>means</hi> for his Miniſters Means and Maintenance; but ordered a Maintenance (as before ſaid) ſuitable to the Goſpel, <hi>Afree Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and a free Maintenance:</hi> and Chriſt being offered up, ended the Law, and firſt Prieſthood, and the Commandment that gave them Tythes, with all its Ordinances, Offerings, Sacrifices, Tythes, &amp;c. he remaining a Prieſt forever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. and chap. 9. verſ. 10, 11, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In the primitive Church's time, when there were many Diſciples and Goſpel Miniſters, that preached to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and other Nations, at great diſtances, the Management whereof muſt needs be ſupported with a ſuitable Charge and Maintenance; yet no mention of Tythes, nor petitioning the Rulers, either for Authority to preach, or Maintenance for their Preaching and Service in their Miniſtry; for they that were ſent forth by Chriſt, were content with his Allowance; and the Churches made proviſion for all ſuch neceſſary Supplies, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the Poor, by their Free Collections and Voluntary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, and there was no Lack or Complaint, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 26. So that as under the Law God ordained Tythes for the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> (that were employ'd about the Temple-worſhip, Sacrifices, &amp;c. and for the Widdow and Fatherleſs, &amp;c. ſo under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, Chriſt Jeſus (the Saints and true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Law-giver) hath alotted and provided for his Miniſters, that he calls, and ſends forth to preach the Goſpel; and his Church takes care of their Poor, who appointed men to ſee that nothing was lacking, <hi>Acts</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 12. Is not this good Goſpel Order? and this we are for. And the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (in a great part of his Epiſtle to them) ſtrives to bring them off from under the Law, the firſt Prieſthood, and all the Ordinances pertaining thereunto, unto Chriſt Jeſus (the Everlaſting High Prieſt) <hi>Heb.</hi> chap. 3. to chap. 11. ſhewing them the invaliditity of the Law and its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, in compariſon of Chriſt; as alſo, how that they are ended and fulfilled in Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>The Prieſthood being chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is made of neceſſity a change alſo of the Law,</hi> and a change of the Command concerning their Maintenance; the firſt Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood terminating in and by Jeſus Chriſt, the perpetual High Prieſt: So here's an end of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſthood, Off rings,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99854:31"/>
Tythes, &amp;c. But if all this will not ſatisfie, and that any will yet plead for Tythes, <hi>jure divino,</hi> and ſo deny Chriſt to be come, and the Law, and Prieſthood, and the Command to be changed, then we anſwer and ſay, 1ſt, Be ſure that he that claims Tythes be a <hi>Levite,</hi> of the Tribe (natural) of <hi>Levi,</hi> that hath no Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the reſt of the Tribes; and that he wholy gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Service of the Alter, Temple, Offerings, Sacrifices; and he himſelf to offer his Heave Offerings: 2dly, Let him that payeth the Tythes be an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> of one of the other 11 Tribes, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deſcended of the other 11 Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> (afterwards called <hi>Iſrael) Jews</hi> or <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> 3dly, Let the very Tythes be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a publick Store-houſe, and part given to the <hi>Levite,</hi> part to the Widdow, part to the Stranger, and part to the Fatherleſs; and look that the <hi>Levite</hi> hath no more then his due, a part, that the reſt may have their parts (for they have as much Right as the <hi>Levite</hi>) leſt the <hi>Levite</hi> get all (as the Prieſts do in our dayes that take Tythes) and let the Law (that was in force before Chriſt came in the Fleſh) be fulfilled; which if done, yet ſuch do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Chriſt come in the Fleſh: But we are of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Stock, of another Race or Line natural, and therefore are not in the leaſt concerned in any reſpect about Tythes, the Law and its Ordinances; for Sacrifices, Tythes, Prieſt-Maintenance, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given and delivered to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and not to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Objection,</hi> If Chriſt, by his coming, ended the Law, Prieſthood, Tythes, &amp;c. and ordained another way of Maintenance for Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as is before ſhewed; and that the Churches, in the primitive Times of Chriſtianity, practized ſo; how comes it to paſs, that the Miniſters of our Nations, and perochial Congregations, in theſe Goſpel times, do now not only demand, but force us to pay them Tythes, or other Maintenance, compulſively?</p>

                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The Apoſtles in their dayes fore-told and propheſied of the great Apoſtacy that would enſue them (1 <hi>John 4. 1, 3. 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3. 2 John 7. Jude</hi> 11, 18.) for in their times, and whilſt the primitive Church kept the good Goſpel-Order, there was no ſuch thing as Tythes amongſt them, nor yet any other compelling way, either of Maintenance for the Miniſtry, or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99854:31"/>
foreing to worſhip; but as the Apoſtacy crept in, and ſpread it ſelf over Nations, in and by which the Apoſtates loſt the true Power of God, and thereby the good Goſpel-order; and then they framed and ſet up Worſhip, Orders and Maintenance in their own Imaginations (for their ſelf-intereſt, and to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Pride) yet not without ſome likely Imitations, to cover themſelves, and delude the people into a belief, that their Wayes and Worſhips were all right, and for a while kept up ſome part of the primitive Form; and ſo they (being erred from the Power and Guidance of God's Spirit, that ſhould call and ſend forth Miniſters, as at the firſt, that would be content with Chriſt's Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance; at laſt, loſt the very Form it ſelf, and ſo invented Forms, Ways, Worſhips and ordaining Miniſters, and then durſt not truſt to the Charity and free Benevolence of the People or Churches, nor yet to Chriſt's Allowance; and then (amongſt other things) ſet up Tythes again (that had been ever diſcontinued among the true Chriſtians) pretending Scripture Plea, <hi>viz. That it was the way of the Prieſts Maintenance under the Law;</hi> and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being (with their Teachers) in the Apoſtacy, and ſo their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings darkened, could not tell but that both their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and their way of Maintenance, together with the Worſhip, and the Form of Worſhip, was all well (ſo great was the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy) <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 3. and thus the Whore <hi>(Myſtery Babylon)</hi> with her enticing Cup of Fornication, made Nations and People drink of, and be drunk with her Abominations. And as Hiſtory relates <hi>(Selden)</hi> there was in theſe Nations no mention of Tythes in the firſt Three Hundred Years after Chriſt, Free Benevolence being the Maintenance; and then the <hi>Pagans</hi> much cruſhed the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and after that <hi>Popery</hi> increaſed, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees brought not only the <hi>Pagans,</hi> but the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>England</hi> (generally) to <hi>Popery,</hi> and then Tythes (that had neither by the true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nor yet by the <hi>Pagans,</hi> been ever paid) were ſet up, yet but as a Gift, and for a while given and diſpenced to the Prieſts and the Poor; but in tract of Time, Preſcription was pleaded for payment of them, till at laſt Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal<note place="margin">Act. &amp; Mon.</note> Courts were ſet up to demand and recover them, for the uſe only of the Clergy, the Poor being then exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, though the Poor was the Cloak, under which pretence they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99854:32"/>
got ſo much intereſt at firſt, as to ſet them up; againſt<note place="margin">Thorp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Huſs.</note> the payment whereof ſeveral Martyrs bore Teſtimony. Then King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth and his Parliament (being <hi>Papiſts</hi>) made a Law for the payment of Tythes to the Clergy (then Popiſh) which was the firſt Eſtabliſhment of Tythes by Civil Law; but when the ſaid King fell out with the Pope, and denyed his Supremacy, and pulled down many Abbies and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, he then appropriated the Title of <hi>Supream Head of the Church</hi> (inſtead of the Pope) and moſt of the Tythes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and ſome of the Tythes he kept, other ſome he gave and ſold to Lay-men, and ſo came Lay-men firſt to be entituled unto Tythes; and the reſt of the Tythes (not ſo appropriated) he, and King <hi>Edward</hi> his Son, confirmed to the Clergy, yet left the Tryal of them unto Eccleſiaſtical Courts.</p>
               <p>And thus the Maintenance that Chriſt appointed for true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Goſpel-Miniſters, which was <hi>Food and Raiment,</hi> came to be ſleighted and loſt, and Tythes ſet up (as aforeſaid) inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and this is a manifeſt Token that the Prieſts now adayes (called Miniſters, nay, they would be called and eſteemed as Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Miniſters) are not the true Miniſters of the Goſpel, or true Goſpel-Miniſters, becauſe they will not be content with a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Maintenance, Chriſt's Allowance; but flee for Refuge and Power to the old Laws of the Land (made by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> Clergy) for their Maintenance; and thus the Plea for Tythes <hi>jure divino,</hi> is turned unto <hi>jure humano.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if now Lay-men plead Inheritance and Law for Tythes, yet in the ground the derivation of them is from their being paid at firſt in right to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſthood, and ſince the Apoſtacy unto the <hi>(Popiſh)</hi> Prieſthood: for ſince the Apoſtacy, tke Clergy were inveſted in them, in right of the Prieſthood, ſo the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is the Original; and the firſt Priſthood being ended and changed (by the coming of Chriſt) the Law for Tythes, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, &amp;c. is alſo changed and diſſannulled; therefore this Plea, of the Tranſmutation of the property of Tythes from <hi>jus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> to <hi>jus humanum,</hi> will not ſerve in ſound reaſon, nor by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to exact Tythes from true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nor yet for them to pay Tythes either to the Clergy or Lay-men. And the Apoſtles continued in Chriſt's Doctrine, and preached the Goſpel freely,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99854:32"/>
coveting no mans Silver, Gold or Apparel; but laboured with their hands, that neither they nor their Goſpel might be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 18.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> layes down in his Epiſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. the Quallification of Miniſters and Biſhops, That they muſt not be Strikers, nor Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, nor greedy of filthy Lucre, nor Proud, &amp;c. and againſt ſuch as preach for Lucre, and make Merchandize of the Word, both he and ſeveral of the Apoſtles bore Teſtimony, as may be ſeen in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>And there having been ſo many Volumns publiſhed of late by ſeveral of our Friends againſt Tythes (enough to ſatisfie a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and rational man) againſt the uſe of them (whether by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or reception) in theſe our Goſpel dayes, that we need not enlarge hereon; and beſides, the Underſtandings of people in our Nations are ſo enlightened, that very few do pay Tythes on the account of Conſcience or Scripture Authority, but as being conſtrained thereunto againſt their Wills; for as peoples eyes are opened, by believing in, and embracing the true Light, Chriſt Jeſus, they will eaſily ſee over the Apoſtacy, unto the primitive true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> times, and ſo to diſcern the true Goſpel-Miniſters, and their Allowances by Chriſt, from the now (Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal) parochal hired Prieſts, and their Maintenance by Tythes and forced wayes, ſet up by men; and that by the Scriptures of Truth Tythes and forced means is not a Maintenance for Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and that he that takes, and he that pays Tythes now, do both deny Chriſt come in the Fleſh.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Touching our not paying to the repair of the Pariſh or publick Houſes of Worſhip (called Churches) we have good Ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> BEcauſe there is no Example for this from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient People of God, the <hi>Jews,</hi> either in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or re-edifying and repairing of the Temple of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> (a Place Appointed and expreſly Commanded of God to be built) For, neither did <hi>David,</hi> that prepaired aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance for the Building of it; nor yet <hi>Solomen</hi> his Son, that built it; nor yet <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> that Re-built and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99854:33"/>
repaired it, would admit of any of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or ſtrange Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to help or aſſiſt them therein; for when their Adverſaries proffered help, they refuſed acceptance, ſaying, <hi>You have nothing to do with us to build a Houſe unto our God; we our ſelves together will build it unto the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. So that the <hi>Jews,</hi> for the love and zeal they bore to God, and his Worſhip, denied thoſe that were not of their Religion (that joyned not with them in their Worſhip) to help them to rebuild or repair the Temple, which was the Place for the <hi>Jews</hi> to worſhip at; and this is contrary to you that call your ſelves Chriſtians, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel others (not of you) to build &amp; mend your Places of worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe there is no Example from the Primitive true Chriſtians; for after Chriſt came (who ended the Temple Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, &amp;c.) there were many thouſands both of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> converted to the Faith, and met in ſeveral Places and Houſes to worſhip God, (<hi>Acts</hi> 11. 26. &amp; 20. 20. &amp; 28. 30.) yet we do not read that they either impoſed upon one another, or compelled the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> (from whom they were turned) to build up Places of Worſhip; nor yet that the unconverted <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> compelled the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> either to build or repair the <hi>Jews</hi> Synagogues, or <hi>Diana's</hi> Temple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is no equity or reaſon for us to pay to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or repairing of thoſe now Places of Worſhip (called Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) for God hath ſo perſwaded our hearts, that we cannot joyn with them that go to worſhip there, we having good Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ground, both againſt the Worſhip it ſelf, the manner of worſhipping, and the Worſhippers; and therefore we refuſe to go to the Place. And can we do leſs then appeal to the equal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of God in men, Whether it is not repugnant to right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Equity, for the Prieſts, and others to ask, much more to aſſeſs and compel (by taking<note place="margin">G. Clapham Prieſt of Mountmelick, and Geo.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99854:33"/>
the Commandments of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. &amp; 9. and where Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Traditions of men form out a (compuiſive) way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for Time, Place, Manner and Matter, as being contrary to Chriſt's Speech to the Woman of <hi>Samaria, Neither in this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> (where the Patriachs worſhipped) <hi>nor yet at</hi> Jeruſalem (the place commanded by God to be built for him (once) to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in) <hi>but the Hour cometh, and now is</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that the true Worſhippers ſhall worſhip God in Spirit, and in Truth; for ſuch the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeks to Worſhip him: and he is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him muſt worſhip in the Spirit,</hi> Joh. 4. 21, 22, 23, 24. And further, doth not this manifeſt, that the litteral Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in this Age are grown very cold, much below God's ancient People, the <hi>Jews,</hi> who, for all they had been baniſhed out of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and been Captives in a ſtrange Land, in <hi>Caldea</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> 77 Years, yet at their return to <hi>Judea,</hi> would not ſuffer any that were not of their Religion and came not to their Worſhip, to help them to re-edifie &amp; repair the Temple, commanded of God to be built? is not this much unlike this Generation of men, that by force make havock of us and out Goods, for not helping them to build and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair their now places of Pariſh-Worſhip (called Churches) for which they have no Command from God to build or repair? So now this may ſerve to inform people how innocently, and that for Conſcience ſake we ſuffer in this thing; and that our Perſecutors have neither Example of God's Antient People, nor of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nor yet Reaſon or Equity on their ſides for what they have done againſt us herein.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> For not going to the publick Worſhip, and not joyning with them in their Worſhip at their ſaid places (called Churches) and for Reproving and Exhorting them to fear God in the ſaid Places, and in Streets and Markets, as we are commanded of the Lord, we have good Ground, though we have or may ſuffer for the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> For it appears by the Scriptures of Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of the World, even before there was any writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or outward Rule commanded or preſcribed by God, that People then offered or worſhipped God each of them according

                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Concerning our not Swearing, not taking off our Hats, and for Working on dayes (by ſome called Holy-days) we have alſo good Ground and Scripture Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> AND firſt, for our refuſing to Swear, we have plain and undeniable Scripture Proofs; 1ſt, from Chriſt Jeſus, the Son of God, in whom we believe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 1. who in his Sermon to his Diſciples, preached and opened the glorious Work and Worth of the Goſpel above the Law (though he came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it) <hi>You have heard,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that it hath been ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not Forſwear thy ſelf, but ſhalt perform unto the Lord thine Oaths; but I ſay unto you,</hi> Swear not at all, <hi>neither by Heaven, &amp;c. but let your Communication be</hi> Yea, yea, Nay, nay; <hi>for whatſoever is more then theſe cometh of Evil,</hi> Mat. 5. 17, 33, 35, 36, 37. And if men were not wilfully bind, and hardned againſt Truth, how could a Mouth be opened, much leſs a Hand lifted up againſt us (by the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity) for our Principles herein, ſeeing Chriſt (the Goſpel-Law giver) bids us not Swear at all, and him we are to hear and obey: And as they under the Law were to Swear truly, ſo we under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are to ſpeak truly; for true Chriſtians are as far to exceed the Jews, as the Goſpel doth the Law, becauſe of that Noble and Juſt Principle in them, which is to lead them and guide them into all Truth, (<hi>John</hi> 16. 13.) to ſpeak and act truly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99854:38"/>
at all times and in all places; and then a Teſtimony to ſpeak the Truth anſwereth unto, and is (in the Ground) as valid as Swearing truly; &amp; that which might be ſworn unto in the time of the Law, is now only to be confirmed by Confeſſion, Yea, yea; or Negation, Nay, nay: And as the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law confirmed their Teſtimony to end Strife, Controverſie, &amp;c. by Swearing, and bound themſelves by an Oath, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Vows and Curſes; ſo the Chriſtians in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and New Covenant, are bound in Conſcience by the Power and Law of Chriſt in them (which is a far greater Bond then Swearing) To do to all Men as they would be done unto, and to perform Equity and Righteouſneſs (in that Love which is the fulfilling of the Law) in the Sight of God and Man, without Swearing Oaths, which were but Figures of this inward Bond or Covenant, confirmed by the Oath of God to the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which the True Chriſtians are of, who witneſs the Subſtance and End of all Oaths without, and of Strife, Doubts and Variances that occaſioned the Oaths; for the requiring of an Oath ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Doubt or Unbelief in the one Party, which is no more to be pleaded for, then it is to be practiced in a true Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>And we do affirm further for our Principle in this matter, That to Swear at all is againſt the Law of the Spirit of Truth that dwells in us, and is againſt the poſitive Command of Chriſt Jeſus herein, who ſaid, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and this fully and plainly excludeth all the Gloſſes and Pretences of all men whatſoever, who would take upon them to interpret Chriſt's Words and Meanings (as they ſay) in this, as if he meant not to bar taking an Oath before a Magiſtrate, or to end a Controverſie in a Suit of Law betwixt two Parties, &amp;c. but as if he meant on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidding Vain, Accuſtomary, and Unlawful Oaths, or Swearing; and ſuch like imagined Stuff many have writ about and pleaded for, which (if well conſidered) is no great marvel; For if they cannot believe in the Light that lighteth them, the Son of God, and his Covenant, how can they own his Doctrine and Principle in this or other things publiſhed by him, or by his Spirit and Authority. 2dly, From the poſitive Precept of the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 12. who preached his Lord and Maſter Chriſt Jeſus, his fame Doctrine againſt Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99854:39"/>
when he wrote to the Twelve ſcattered Tribes of the Jews, who by the old Law were allowed or commanded to Swear truly; but when they were converted to the Faith, and come to own and believe in Chriſt and his Doctrine, then they were oblieged and commanded not to Swear at all, no not to Swear truly it ſelf, but to ſpeak the Truth, their word Yea to be Yea, their word Nay to be Nay; for the Apoſtle ſeeing (may be finding) and foreſeeing, that theſe converted <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> becauſe of former Precepts &amp; Cuſtoms in the Law (which they had been under) might uſe or plead for ſome ſort of Swearing (like People now, who argue for Swearing before a Magiſtrate) contrary to Chriſts Command, therefore he puts a greater weight then ordinary upon this Doctrine, as if the concernment thereby had exceeded his other Doctrine, in ſaying, <hi>But above all things, Swear not—by any Oath</hi>—Neither do we read that any of the other Apoſtles uſed the like Doctrine to the converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> at <hi>Rome, Corinth, Epheſus, Galatia, &amp;c.</hi> againſt Swearing, there being no ſuch need to them that were not oblieged by the Law to Swear in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpect. So here are two plain Scripture Proofs for our Principle and Practice herein; and when any can produce Scripture in the New Teſtament, to prove (ſo plainly) their Practice of Swearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Goſpel-dayes, before a Magiſtrate (which they call a lawful Oath) or yet before any other, or upon any occaſion whatſoever, to be lawful, and allowed of, or commanded by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, who are the Authors of the Book called the New Teſtament, then we may give further Anſwer, or write more about it; but till then, they (eſpecially they that profeſs Chriſt, and ought to obey his Command) ought not to blame us, much leſs to perſecute, fine, or impriſon us for obeying the Command of Chriſt, and obſerving the Doctrine of his bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>James.</hi>

willing and ready to ſerve in any Office or Place meet for us, and which we are capable of, &amp; faithfully to perform the ſame, as alſo, to give in Evidence by ſpeaking truly, ſo as that we may not break Chriſt's Command, or ſtain our Conſciences through Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And for a further Teſtimony of our Sincerity herein, we further ſay and declare, That we are content to ſuffer as much for not Serving truly, and for not Speaking and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing truly, as thoſe that are Perjured or Forſworn; for we hold our ſelves as much (yes more) oblieged by affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſpeaking Truth by our word Yea, and Nay, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do by Swearing truly, or performing their Places by an Oath. And if this ſufficeth not, then we muſt needs ſay, Its hard to perſwade men of a contrary mind to us herein (until they come to own and believe in the Truth, Chriſt the Light, and then they will (with us) be like-minded with us) that what we ſay, affirm and witneſs is really Truth, or truly ſaid and done; ſeeing they themſelves are often doubtful of the verity of what is ſworn or teſtified upon Oath, by ſuch, as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them, and are of the ſame Opinion with them, and hold it (as they do) lawful to Swear; for ſeveral times, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Swearers, nor the Matter ſworn, is believed by the Magiſtrate; for men of good Fame are called and depended on for the trueſt Evidence: So that it appeareth, That its not the taking of a bare Oath (ſimply conſidered as an Oath) which oblieges to perform or evidence and ſwear truly, but rather the Honeſty and good Conſcience of the Party; which proves the Performance from a Principle within, and not from a formal Oath: &amp; then we ſay, Why ſhould not a man as well be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd in ſpeaking truly, as ſwearing truly; ſeeing all that ſwear cannot be believed, there being ſo many Perjured &amp; Falſe-ſworn?</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For not taking off our Hats (which are part of our Bodily Garments, and put and placed upon our Heads, to keep them warm and dry, as the reſt of our Garments are for the other parts of our Bodies) and ſo not Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens Perſons, with pulling them off, which (it ſeems) troubleth and diſtaſteth the minds of ſome men, that ſeek the Honour below, in order to content and ſatisfie the Pride and Ambition; for curreous and good-natured men contemn and diſregard it, looking upon it (at beſt) but an Alamode

Complement of a late Edition, and rather become a Faſhion in our Country, a National or general Cuſtom, then any abſolute matter of Duty or Neceſſity: And beſides, it would be no hard thing to prove the uſe of National or general Cuſtoms to be incongtuous with and diſſonant unto the Life of a true Chriſtian, who is not to be faſhionedunto the World: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. ſo that the not putting them off (to anſwer the Will, a lofty part in man) is alſo Matter of Conſcience to us; for God knows our hearts, that its done in the Croſs of Chriſt Jeſus, and not in Contempt of Authority, or mens Perſons bearing Rule; For we dare not Reſpect Perſons, &amp; act contrary to the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, who ſaid, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 1, to 11. <hi>If ye have Reſpect to Perſons, ye commit Sin, and are convinced of the Law as Tranſgreſſors:</hi> to this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees Chriſt's Saying to his Hearers, <hi>John</hi> 5. 41, 44. <hi>How can ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve which receive Honour one of another, and ſeek not the Honour that comes down from God only?</hi> and we do not read in the Scriptures, that of all that were brought, or voluntarily went before Kings, Dukes Governours and Magiſtrates, that any were commanded to put off their Hats or Bonnets; nay, <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> was not offended (as we read) with the three Children for their Hats, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 21. for they were caſt into the Fire with their Hoſen and Hats—Doth not the <hi>Turk</hi> mock it <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for putting off their Hats, &amp; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their bare Heads? Is not this a Reproof to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that Perſecute, Fine and Impriſon for not putting off the Hat to them, becauſe they have not the Hat-Honour, and Hat-Reſpect, which they cannot ſay is the Honour from above, which Chriſt commendeth to ſeek?</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For Working or Opening our Shops on the Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, called Holy-dayes, we have this to ſay, which, though little, yet may ſuffice a moderate man, and will a true <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> We find (<hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 6.) the Law allowed Six Dayes in the Week to Work or Labour on, and neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles did ever forbid it, nor yet ordained any ſuch dayes as Holy-days to be kept and obſerved, by the Churches in the Primitive Times. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 41. 5, 6. <q>One Man eſteemeth one Day above another, another eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth every Day alike; let every man be fully perſwaded in his own Mind: he that regards a Day, regards it unto the Lord; and he that regards not the Day to the Lord, he doth not regard it.</q>

And he alſo ſaid, They ſhould not judge one another about ſuch things. And ſeeing that neither the Apoſtles, nor the Councils, in their dayes, made any ſuch Decree or Law, for obſerving ſuch dayes; have not therefore theſe Decrees and Laws been made by the Pope and his Councils ſince the Apoſtles dayes? And who ſhall be obſerved, the Apoſtles, or the Pope, judge ye? So that there being no Inſtitution of ſuch dayes by Chriſt, his Apoſtles, or Primitive Councils; why ſhould we ſuffer or be perſecuted, for following our lawful Labours and Callings thereon, eſpecially by ſuch as are called Chriſtians.</p>
