            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Disposition of the

so industrious and
frugall; the Nature of
the Countrey, euery
where Fortifiable with
water, the Scituation of
it, hauing behinde them the Baltique Sea, which
yeelds them all materials for Ships, and many other
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13885:3"/>
Commodities, and for Men, hard before them,
<hi>France,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> both fearing the Spanish
greatnesse; and therefore, both Concurring for
their Ayde; the remotenesse of their Master from
them; the Change of Religion falling out about the
time of their Reuolt, and now the Marquise of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi>
a Protestant, like to become Duke of
<hi>Cleue.</hi> The discontentments of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>
did first appeare, soone after the going away of the
Kings of <hi>Spaine,</hi> while the Dutchesse of <hi>Parma</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned;
to suppresse which beginnings, the Duke
of <hi>Alva</hi> being sent, inflamed them more, vpon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to bring in the Inquisition and Spanish
Decimation, vpon the Beheading Count <hi>Horne,</hi> and
Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> persecuting those of the Religion,
and vndertaking to build Cittadels vpon all their
Townes, which hee effected at <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> but enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising
the like at <hi>Flushing,</hi> that Towne reuolted first
and vnder it began the Warre.</p>
            <p>But the more generall reuolt of the Prouinces
happened after the Death of <hi>Don Lewis de Requiesens,</hi>
and vpon the comming downe of <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi>
when all the Prouinces, excepting <hi>Luxenburgh,</hi>
vpon the sacke of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> and other Insolencies,
Proclaimed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Rebels and Enemies to
the King; yet the abjuring of their obedience from
the Crowne of <hi>Spaine</hi> was not in a yeare or two
after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> vpon their first standing
out, offered the Soueraigntie of themselues to the
Queene, then the Protection, both which shee neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13885:3"/>
and that while the <hi>French</hi> sent greater ayde,
and more men of qualitie then wee; but after the
Ciuill Warre began in <hi>France,</hi> that kept them busie
at home, and then the Queene, seeing the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of their being supported, vpon the pawning
of <hi>Brill</hi> and <hi>Flushing,</hi> sent Money and Men;
And since that, most part of the great exploits
there haue beene done by the <hi>English,</hi> who were
commonly the third part of the Armie, being
foure Regiments, besides eleuen hundred in <hi>Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing,</hi>
and the <hi>Ramekins,</hi> and fiue hundred in the
<hi>Brill.</hi> But of late the King of <hi>France</hi> appearing
more for them then ours, and paying himselfe the
<hi>French</hi> that are there, they giue equall, if not more
Countenance to that Nation. But vpon these two
Kings they make their whole dependancie, and
though with more respect to him that is stronger, for
the time, yet so as it may giue no distaste vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>For the manner of their Gouernment; They
haue vpon occasion, an assembly of the generall
States, like our Parliament, being composed of
those which are sent from euery Prouince, vpon
summons; and what these Enact stands for
Lawe. Then is there besides, a Counsell of State,
residing for the most part at the <hi>Hage,</hi> which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
daily occasions, being rather imployed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
affaires of State then of particular Iustice.
The most potent in this Counsell was BARNA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILL,
by reason of his Aduocates of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And besides both these, euery Prouince and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13885:4"/>
great Towne haue particular Counsells of their
owne. To all which assemblies, aswell of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
States, as the rest, the Gentrie is called for order
sake, but the State indeed is Democraticall, the
Merchant and the Tradesman being predominant,
the Gentrie now but few and poore; and euen at
the beginning the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> saw it safer to
relie vpon the Townes then them: Neither are the
Gentrie so much engaged in the cause, the people
hauing more aduantages in a free State, they in a
Monarchy. Their care in gouernment is very exact
and particular, by reason that euery one hath an
imediate interest in the State; Such is the equality
of Iustice, that it renders euery man satisfied; such
the publike regularity, as a man may see their
Lawes were made to guide, not to entrappe; such
their exactnesse in casting the expence of an Armie,
as that it shall bee equally farre from superfluity and
want, and as much order and certaintie in their acts
of Warre, as in ours of Peace, teaching it to bee
both Ciuill and rich, And they still retaine that
signe of a Common-wealth yet vncorrupted, <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
Pouertie and publike Weale:</hi> for no one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
man there is exceeding rich, and few very
poore, and no State more sumptuous in all publike
things. But the question is; whether this, being a
free State, will aswell subsist in Peace, as it hath done
hitherto in Warre, Peace leauing euery one to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his particular wealth, when feare, while the
Warre lasts, makes them concurre for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
safety; And <hi>Zealand,</hi> vpon the least securitie,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13885:4"/>
hath euer beene enuious at the predominancie of
<hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Vtrich,</hi> ready to Mutinie for Religion:
and besides, it is a doubt, whether the same care and
sinceritie would continue, if they were at their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
as appeares yet whiles they are but in rising.
The Reuenew of this State ariseth chiefely from the
Earle of <hi>Hollands</hi> Demaynes, and Confiscated
Church liuings, the rising and falling of Money,
which they vse with much aduantage, their Fishing
vpon our Coasts, and those of <hi>Norway,</hi> Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
out of the Enemies Countrie, Taxes vpon all
things at home, and Impositions vpon all Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes
from abroad. Their expences vpon their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours,
their Shippings, their Ditches, their
Rampiers and Munition, and commonly they haue
in pay by Sea and Land 60000. men.</p>
            <p>For the strength; The nature of the Countrie
makes them able to defend themselues long by land,
neither could any thing haue endangered them so
much as the last great Frost, had not the Treatie
beene then on foot, because the Enemy being then
Master of the field, that rendred their Ditches, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
and Riuers as firme ground.</p>
            <p>There belongs to that State 20000. Vessells of all
sorts, so that if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> were entirely beaten out
of those parts, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi>
would take asmuch paines to suppresse, as euer they
did to raise them: For being our Enemies, they are
able to giue vs the Law at Sea, and eate vs out of all
trade, much more the <hi>French,</hi> hauing at this time
three Ships for our one, though none so good as our
best.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:13885:5"/>
Now that whereupon the most part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenew
and strength depends, is their Traffique, in
which mysterie of State they are at this day the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest;
for all the Commodities that this part of the
world wants, and the <hi>Indies</hi> haue, as Spice, Silke, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells,
Gold, they are become the Conueyers of
them for the rest of Christendome, except vs, as the
<hi>Venetians</hi> were of old; And all those Commodities
that those Northerne Countries abound with, and
these Southerne stand in need of, they likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey
thither, which was the auncient Trade of the
Easterlings: And this they doe, hauing little to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of their owne, by buying of their Neighbour-Countries
the former, and selling them againe what
they bring backe at their owne prises, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
liue vpon the idlenesse of others. And to
this purpose their Scituation serues fitly; for Riuers
of the <hi>Rhene,</hi> the <hi>Maze,</hi> and <hi>Skeld</hi> end all in their
Dominions; and the <hi>Baltike</hi> Sea lies not farre from
them: All which affoord them whateuer the great
Continent of <hi>Germany, Russia,</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> yeelds;
then they againe lying betweene <hi>Germany</hi> and the
Sea, doe furnish it backe with all Commodities
forraigne.</p>
            <p>To remember some pieces of their Discipline as
patternes of the rest; The Watches at night are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
all of one Nation, so that they can hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
to giue vp any one Towne. The Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are no where so strict vpon Musters, and where
he findes a Company thither hee reduceth them, so
that when an Armie marcheth the List and the Poll,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13885:5"/>
are neuer farre disagreeing. Their Army is euer well
Clothed, well Armed, and had neuer yet occasion
to mutinie for Pay or Victualls. The Souldiers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
no where fewer Insolencies vpon the Burgers,
fewer Robberies vpon the Countrie, nor the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
fewer deceipts vpon the Souldiers. And lastly,
they prouide well that their Generall shall haue
small meanes to inuade their liberties: For first their
Army is composed of many Nations, which haue
their seuerall Commanders, and the Commands are
disposed by the States themselues, not by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
And secondly he hath neuer an implicit Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
left to discretion, but, by reason their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
hath no great bounds, receiues daily Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
what to doe.</p>
            <p>Their Territory containes sixe entire Prouinces,
<hi>Holland, Zealand, Virick, Groninghen, Oueriscell,</hi> and
<hi>Ariezland,</hi> besides three parts of <hi>Gelderland,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Townes in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> the ground
of which is for the most part fruitfull; the Townes
no where so equally beautifull, strong, and rich,
which equality growes by reason that they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
some one Staple Commodity to euery Town
of note; only <hi>Amsterdam</hi> not only passeth them all,
but euen <hi>Siuill, Lisbone,</hi> or any other Mart Towne
in Christendome, and to it is appropriated the trade
of the <hi>East Indies,</hi> where they maintaine commonly
forty Ships, besides which there goe twice a yeare
from it, and the adioyning Townes, a great Fleete
to the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea: Vpon the fall of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> that
rose rather then <hi>Middleborough,</hi> though it stand at
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13885:6"/>
the same Riuers mouth, and is their second Mart
towne, to which is appropriated our <hi>English</hi> Cloth.</p>
            <p>Concerning the people, they are neither much
deuout, nor much wicked, giuen all to drinke, and
eminently to no other vice; hard in bargaining, but
Iust, surly and respectlesse, as in all Democracies,
thirstie, industrious and cleanly, dishartened vpon
the least ill successe, and insolent vpon good; Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
in Manufactures, cunning in Traffique, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
for matter of Action, that naturall slownesse
of theirs sutes better, by reason of the aduisednesse
and perseuerance it brings with it, then the rashnesse
and changeablenesse of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Florentine</hi>
wits, and the equality of spirits which is among
them and the <hi>Swissers,</hi> renders them so fit for a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracie,
which kinde of Gouernment, Nations
of more stable wittes, being once come to a Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
greatnesse, haue seldome long endured.</p>

heartlesse, and rather repining against their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours,
then reuengefull against the Enemies, the
brauery of that Gentrie which was left, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
of the Merchant quite decayed; the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
labouring only to liue, without desire to
be rich to anothers vse; the Townes (whatsoeuer
concerned not the strength of them) ruinous; And
to conclude, the people here growing poore with
lesse taxes, then they flourish with on the States side.</p>
            <p>This Warre hath kept the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> busie
euer since it began (which some 38. yeares agoe) and
spending all the Money that the <hi>Indies,</hi> and all the
Men that <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> could affoord, hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne
him from perseuering in any other Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise;
Neither could he giue ouer this, without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
the meanes to vndertake any thing hereafter
vpon <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> and consequently the hope
of the Westerne Monarchy. For without that han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the Mynes of <hi>Peru,</hi> had done little hurt in these
parts, in comparison of what they haue. The cause
of the expensefulnes of it, is the remotenesse of those
Prouinces from <hi>Spaine,</hi> by reason of which, euery
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13885:7"/>
Souldier of <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> before he can arriue there,
costs the King an hundred Crownes, and not aboue
one of ten that arriues prooues good; besides, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the distance, a great part of the Money is
drunke vp betwixt the Officers that conuey it and
pay it. The cause of the continuance of it, is, not only
the strength of the Enemy, but partly by reason that
the Commanders themselues are content the War
shall last, so to maintaine and render themselues ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries,
and partly because the people of those
Countries are not so eager to haue the other redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
as willing to be in the like state themselues.</p>
            <p>The vsuall Reuenew of those Prouinces which the
Arch-Duke hath, amounts to 1200000. Crownes a
yeare, besides which, there come from <hi>Spaine</hi> euery
Moneth to maintaine the War, 150000. Crownes.
It was at the first 300000. Crownes a moneth, but it
fell by fifties to this at the time when the Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               <hi>Flanders</hi> payes more toward the warre then all
the rest, as <hi>Holland</hi> doth with the States. There is no
<hi>Spaniard</hi> of the Counsell of State, nor Gouernour of
any Prouince, but of the Counsell of Warre, which
is only actiue; There they only are, and haue in their
hands all the strong Townes &amp; Castles of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces,
of which the Gouernours haue but only the
Title.</p>
            <p>The Nations of which their Armie consists, are
chiefly <hi>Spaniards</hi> &amp; <hi>Italians,</hi> emulous one of another
there, as on the other side the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English,</hi>
and of the Country, chiefly <hi>Burgundians</hi> and <hi>Wallons.</hi>
The Popes Letters, and <hi>Spinola's</hi> inclination keepe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13885:7"/>
the <hi>Italians</hi> there, almost in equality of Command
with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> himselfe.</p>
            <p>The Gouernors for the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> there suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiuely
haue bin the D. of <hi>Alva, Don Lewis de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesens,
Don Iohn d'Austria,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> the
Arch-Duke <hi>Ernestus,</hi> the Cardinall <hi>Andrew</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strich,</hi>
and the Cardinall <hi>Albert,</hi> till he maried the
<hi>Infanta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where the Dominion of the Ach-Duke and the
States part, there also changeth the nature of the
Country, that is, about <hi>Antwerp:</hi> For all below be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flat, and betwixt Medow and Marsh, thence it
begins to rise and become Champion, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the people are more quicke and spiritfull, as
the <hi>Brabanter, Flemming,</hi> and <hi>Wallon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most remarkable place in that side is <hi>Antwerp</hi>
(which rose vpon the fall of <hi>Bruges)</hi> equally strong
and beautifull, remaining yet so, vpon the strength
of its former greatnesse; twice spoyled by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>
and the like attempted by the <hi>French.</hi> The Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadell
was built there by the D. of <hi>Alva,</hi> but renued
by the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> after his 18. moneths besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
it, the Towne accepting a Castle rather then a
Garrison to mingle among them. There are yet in
the Towne of Citizens 30000. fighting men, 600. of
which kept Watch nightly, but they allowed neither
Cannon vpon the Rampier, nor Megazins of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
In the Castle are 200. peeces of Ordnance, and
commonly seuen or eight hundred Souldiers. <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
is the best of the seuenteene Provinces, but the
Havens thereof are naught.</p>

            <byline>By Sir THOMAS OVERBVRY.</byline>
            <p>HAuing seene the forme of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
and a Prouince, with the different
effects of Warres in them, I entred <hi>France,</hi>
flourishing with Peace, and of Monarchies the most
absolute, because the King there, not only makes
Peace and Warres, Calls and dissolues Parliaments,
Pardoneth, naturalizeth, Innobleth, Names the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of Money, Presseth to the Warre; but euen
makes Lawes, and imposes Taxes at his pleasure:
And all this he doth alone: for as for that forme that
his Edicts must be authorized by the next Court of
Parliament, that is, the next Court of soueraigne
Iustice; first the Presidents thereof are to be chosen
by him, and to bee put out by him; and secondly,
when they concurre not with the King, he passeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing without them, as he did the last Edict for
the Protestants: And for the assembly of the three
Estates, it is growne now almost as extraordinary as
a generall Counsell; with the losse of which their
Liberty fell, and when occasion vrgeth, it is possible
for the King to procure, that all those that shall bee
sent thither, shall be his Instruments: for the Duke
of <hi>Guise</hi> effected as much at the assembly of <hi>Bloys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The occasion that first procured the King that
Supremacie, that his Edicts should be Lawes, was,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13885:8"/>
the last Inuasion of the <hi>English,</hi> for at that time they
possessing two parts of <hi>France,</hi> the three Estates
could not assemble, whereupon they did then
grant that power vnto <hi>Charles</hi> the Seuenth during
the Warre; And that which made it easie for <hi>Lewis</hi>
the Eleuenth and his Successors to continue the
same, the occsion ceasing, was, that the Clergie and
Gentrie did not runne the same fortune with the
people there, as in <hi>England;</hi> for most of the Taxes
falling only vpon the people, the Clergie aud Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
being forborne, were easily induced to leaue
them to the Kings mercy. But the King hauing got
strength vpon the Pesants, hath beene since the bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to inuade part of both their liberties.</p>
            <p>For the succession of this Monarchie, it hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
without intermission these 1200. yeares, vnder
three Races of Kings. No Nation hath heretofore
done greater things abroad in <hi>Palestine</hi> and <hi>Egipt,</hi>
besides all parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> but for these last 400.
yeares, they haue only made Sallies into <hi>Italie,</hi> and
often suffered at home.</p>
            <p>Three hundred yeares the <hi>English</hi> afflicted them,
making two firme Inuasions vpon them, and taking
their King prisoner; the second greatnesse of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
next the Emperour, being then in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
betwixt vs and them; And to secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
against vs, rather then the House of <hi>Austria,</hi>
as it then stood, they chose to marry the Heire of
<hi>Bretaigne</hi> before that of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> And for this last
hundred yeares, the <hi>Spantard</hi> vndertaking them, hath
eaten them out of all but <hi>France,</hi> and endangered
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13885:9"/>
that too. But for this present, <hi>France</hi> had neuer, as
<hi>France,</hi> a more entire greatnesse, though it hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
beene richer. For since the Warre the King is
only got afore hand, the Country is but yet in reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering,
the War hauing lasted by spaces 32. yeares,
and so generally, that no man but had an Enemie
within three miles, and so the Countrey became
Frontier all ouer. Now that which hath made them,
at this time, so largely great at home, is their adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into themselues the lesser adioyning Nations,
without destruction, or leauing any marke of
strangenesse vpon them, as the <hi>Bretons, Gascoignes,
Provincalls,</hi> and others which are not <hi>French;</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the which Vnions, their nature, which is easie
and harborous to strangers, hath done more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Lawes could haue effected, but with long
time.</p>
            <p>The King (as I said) enioying what <hi>Lewis</hi> the
11. did gaine, hath the entire Soueraigntie in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
because hee can make the Parliament doe what
he please, or else doe what he please without them.
For the other three Estates; The Church is there
very rich, being estimated to enioy the third part
of the Reuenew of <hi>France,</hi> but otherwise nothing
so potent as else-where, partly because the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not admitted in <hi>France,</hi> but principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Popes ordinary power is much restrayned
there, by the Liberties which the <hi>French</hi> Church
claymeth; Which Liberties doe not so much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sranchize
the Church it selfe, as conferre the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
the Pope looseth vpon the King, as first fruites,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13885:9"/>
and the disposing of all Spirituall preferments.
And by reason of this neutralitie of Authoritie, the
Church-men suffer more there, then either in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
where they wholly depend vpon the King, or
in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> where they wholly subsist by
the Pope; because the Pope is not able totally to
support them, and the King takes occasion euer to
suppresse them, as beeing not entirely his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects:
and to him they pay yearely both the
tenth of all their Tithe, and of all their Temporall
land.</p>
            <p>The Gentrie are the onely entire Body there,
which participate with the Prerogatiues of the
Crowne; for from it they receiue Priuiledges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all other men, and a kinde of limited Regality
vpon their Tenants, besides reall supply to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
by Gouernments and Pensions, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from Tallies vpon their owne Lands; that is,
vpon their Demaines, and whatsoeuer else they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
by their Seruants; but so much as they let to
Tenants is presently Tallie-able, which causeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
abatement in the Rent; and in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of this, they owe to the King the <hi>Ban</hi> and the
<hi>Arriereban;</hi> that is, to serue him and his Lieutenant
three Moneths within the Land at their owne Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
And as in Warre they vndergoe the greatest
part of the danger, so then is their power most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorie
aboue the rest, whereas in time of Peace,
the King is ready to support inferiour persons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, and is glad to see them to waste one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
by Contention in Law for feare they grow
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13885:10"/>
rich, because hee fore-sees, that as the Nobilitie one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
can doe him seruice, so they onely misapplyed can
doe him harme.</p>
            <p>The auntient Gentrie of <hi>France</hi> was most of it
consumed in the Warres of <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> and
some in those of Saint <hi>Lewis,</hi> because vpon their set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out they pawned all their <hi>Feifs</hi> to the Church,
and few of them were after redeemed; by reason
whereof the Church possesseth at this day the third
part of the best <hi>Feifs</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and that Gentrie was
after made vp by Aduocates, Financiers, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
innobled, which now are reputed auntient,
and are dayly eaten out againe and repayred by the
same kinde of men.</p>
            <p>For the people; All those that haue any kinde of
profession or Trade, liue well; but for the meere
Peasants that labour the ground, they are onely
Spunges to the King, to the Church and the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
hauing nothing to their owne, but to the vse of
them, and are scarce allowed (as Beasts) enough to
keepe them able to doe seruice; for besides their
Rent, they pay vsually two thirds to the King.</p>
            <p>The manner of Gouernment in <hi>France,</hi> is mixt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Peace and Warre, being composed as well of
Military Discipline, as Ciuill Iustice, because hauing
open Frontiers and strong Neighbours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
obnoxious to sodaine Inuasions, they cannot
(as in <hi>England)</hi> ioyne euer Peace &amp; security together.</p>
            <p>For the Military part, there is euer a Constable
and a Marshall in being, Troupes of Horse and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of Foot in pay, and in all Prouinces and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13885:10"/>
places of strength, Gouernours and Garrisons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed,
all which are meanes for the preferment of
the Gentry; But those as they giue security against
the enemy, so when there is none they disturbe the
enioying of Peace, by making the Countries taste
somewhat of a Prouince. For the Gentry finde a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt the Gouernours fauour &amp; disfauor,
and the souldiers commit often Insolencies vpon
the people.</p>
            <p>The Gouernments there are so well disposed by the
King, as no Gouernour hath meanes to giue ouer a
Prouince into the Enemies hand, the Commands
thereof are so scattered: for the Gouernour Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the Country, and for the most part the chiefe
Towne; then is there a Lieutenant, to the King, not
to him of the same, and betwixt these two there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
Iealousie nourished; then hath euery Towne and
Fortresse particular Gouernours, which are not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterne
to that of the Prouince, but hold imediately
from the Prince, and many times the towne hath one
Gouernour and the Castle another.</p>
            <p>The aduantages of Gouernours (besides their pay
from the King) are Presents from the Country, dead
payes, making their Megazins of Come and powder
more then they need at the Kings price, and where
they stand vpon the Sea, ouerseeing of vnlawfull
goods: Thus much in Peace: In Warre they are
worth as much as they will exact. <hi>Languedoc,</hi> is the
best, then <hi>Bretaigne. Prouince</hi> is worth by all these
means to the D. of <hi>Guise</hi> 20000. Crownes a yeare;
but <hi>Prouince</hi> only he holds without a Lieutenant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:13885:11"/>
Concerning the Ciuill Iustice there, it is no where
more Corrupt nor expencefull. The Corruptnesse
of it proceeds, first by reason that the King sells the
places of Iustice at as high a rate as can bee honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made of them; so that all thriuing is left to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and the gaine the King hath that wayes,
tempts him to make a multitude of Officers, which
is another burthen to the Subiect. Secondly, the
Presidents are not bound to judge according to the
written Law, but according to the Equitie drawne
out of it, which Libertie doth not so much admit
Conscience, as leaue wit without limits. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencefulnesse
of it ariseth from the multitude of
Lawes, and multiplicitie of formes of Processes, the
which two both beget doubt, and make them long
in resoluing. And all this <hi>Chiquanerey,</hi> as they call
it, is brought into <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> vpon the Popes
comming to reside at <hi>Avignion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the strength of <hi>France,</hi> It is at this day the
greatest Vnited force of Christendome; The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
in which it consists are these: The shape of
the Countrey, which beeing round, no one part is
farre from succouring another; The multitude of
good Townes and places of strength therein are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to stay an Army, if not to waste it, as <hi>Metz</hi> did
the Emperours; the masse of Treasure which the
King hath in the <hi>Bastile;</hi> The number of Arsenals
distributed vpon the Frontiers, besides that of <hi>Paris,</hi>
all which are full of good Armes and Artillerie: And
for ready men, the 5. Regiments bestowed vp &amp; down
in Garrisons, together with the 2000. of the Guard;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13885:11"/>
the Troupes of ordinary and light Horse, all euer
in pay; besides their Gentrie all bred Souldiers, and
of which they thinke there are at this present 50000.
fit to beare Armes: And to Command all these, they
haue at this day the best Generalls of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which is the only commodity the Ciuill wars
did leaue them.</p>
            <p>The weaknesse of it are, first the want of a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Infantry, which proceeds from the ill distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their wealth; for the Peysant, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
the greatest part of the people, hauing no
share allowed him, is heartlesse and feeble, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
vnseruiceable for all Military vses, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of which, they are first forced to borrow ayde of
the <hi>Swissers</hi> at a great Charge, and secondly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their Armies for the most part of Gentlemen,
which makes the losse of a battaile there almost ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recouerable.
The second is the vnproportionable
part of the land which the Church holds, all which
is likewise dead to Militarie vses. For, as they say
there, <hi>The Church will loose nothing, nor defend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
The third is the want of a Competent number
of Ships and Gallies, by reason of which defect,
first the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ouermasters them vpon the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranian,
and the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollander</hi> vpon the
Ocean, and secondly it renders them poore in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
Trade, so that all the great actions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome
for these fifty yeares, hauing beene bent
vpon the <hi>Indies,</hi> they only haue sate idle. The fourth
is the weaknesse of their Frontiers, which is so much
the more dangerous, because they are possessed, all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13885:12"/>
but the Ocean, by the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> for <hi>Savoy</hi> hath beene
alwaies as his owne for all vses against <hi>France.</hi> The
last is the difference of Religion among themselues,
which will euer yeeld matter of ciuill dissention, and
consequently cause the weaker to stand in neede of
forraigne succours. The ordinarie Reuenew of the
King, is, as they say now, some 14. Millions of
Crowns, which arise principally from the Demaines
of the Crowne, the gabell of Salt, tallies vpon the
Countrie, Customes vpon the Merchandize, sale of
Offices, the yearely Tithe of all that belongs to the
Church, the rising and falling of Money. Fines and
Confiscations cast vpon him by the Law; but as for
Wardships, they are only knowne in <hi>Normandy.</hi> His
expence is chiefely Ambassadours, Munition, Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
Fortifying, and maintaining of Gallies. As for
Ships when he needs them, he makes an Embarque;
In Pay for Souldiers, Wages for Officers, Pentions
at home &amp; abroad, vpon the entertaining his House,
his State, and his priuate pleasures. And all the first,
but the Demaynes were granted, in the beginning,
vpon some vrgent occasion, and after by Kings
made perpetuall, the occasion ceasing; and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes
it selfe granted, because the King should liue
vpon their owne without oppressing their Subiects.
But at this day, though the Reuenew bee thus great,
and the taxes vnsupportable, yet doe they little more
then serue for necessary publike vses. For the King of
<hi>Spains</hi> greatnes &amp; Neighbourhood, forceth the King
there to liue continually vpon his Guard; and the
treasure which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> receiues from his <hi>Indies,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:13885:12"/>
constraines him to raise his Reuenew thus by Taxes,
so to be able in some proportion to beare vp against
him, for feare else he should be bought out of all his
Confederates and seruants.</p>
            <p>For the Relation of this State to others, It is first
to be considered, that this part of Christendome is
ballanced betwixt the three Kings of <hi>Spaine, France,</hi>
and <hi>England,</hi> as the other part betwixt the <hi>Russian,</hi>
the Kings of <hi>Poland, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Denmarke.</hi> For as
for <hi>Germany,</hi> which if it were entirely subiect to one
Monarchy, would be terrible to all the rest, so being
deuided betwixt so many Princes, and those of so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
power, it serues only to ballance it selfe, and
entertaine easie Warre with the <hi>Turke,</hi> while the
<hi>Persian</hi> with-holds him in a greater. And euery one
of those first three, hath his particular strength, and
his particular weakenesse: <hi>Spaine</hi> hath the aduantage
of both the rest in Treasure, but is defectiue in Men,
his Dominions are scattered, and the conueyance
of his Treasure from the <hi>Indies</hi> lyes obnoxious to
the power of any Nation that is stronger by Sea.
<hi>France</hi> abounds with Men, lyes close together,
and hath Money sufficiently. <hi>England</hi> beeing an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
is hard to be Inuaded, abounds with Men, but
wants Money to imploy them. For their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
weaknesse: <hi>Spaine</hi> is to be kept busie in the <hi>Low-Countries:
France</hi> is to bee afflicted with Protestants,
and <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Ireland. England</hi> is not able to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
against any of the other hand to hand, but ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the <hi>Lowe-Countries</hi> it can giue Lawe to
both by Sea, and ioyned with either of them two it is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13885:13"/>
able to oppresse the third as <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight did.</p>
            <p>Now the only entire body in Christendome that
makes head against the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy, is <hi>France;</hi>
and therefore they say in <hi>France,</hi> that the day of the
ruine of <hi>France,</hi> is the Eue of the ruine of <hi>England:</hi>
And thereupon <hi>England</hi> hath euer since the <hi>Spanish</hi>
greatnesse, enclined rather to maintaine <hi>France</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to ruine it; as when King <hi>Francis</hi> was taken
prisoner, the King of <hi>England</hi> lent Money towards
the payment of his Ransome: And the late Queene
(when the Leagers, after the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> his death,
had a designe to Cantonize <hi>France)</hi> though offered
a part, would not consent. So then this reason of
State, of mutuall preseruation, conioyning them,
<hi>England</hi> may be accounted a sure Confederate of
<hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> by reason it partly subsists by it;
the Protestant Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> because they
haue Countenance from it against the house of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi>
the Protestant <hi>Swissers</hi> for Religion and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
the <hi>Venetians</hi> for protection against the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
in <hi>Italy:</hi> So that all their friends are either Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
or enclyning, and whosoeuer is extreme Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,
is their enemie, and Factors for the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Monarchy, as the Pope, the Cardinalls for the most
part, and totally the Iesuites, the Catholike Princes
of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Catholicks of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
For the Iesuites, which are the Ecclesiasticall
strength of Christendome, <hi>France,</hi> notwithstanding
the many late Obligations, hath cause to despaire of
them: for they intending, as one Pope, so one King,
to suppresse the Protestants, and for the better
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13885:13"/>
support of Christendome against the <hi>Turke,</hi> and
seeing <hi>Spaine</hi> the likelier to bring this to passe,
they follow the neerer probability of effecting
their end.</p>
            <p>No addition could make <hi>France</hi> so dangerous
to vs, as that of our <hi>Lowe-Countries:</hi> for so it
were worse then if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> himselfe had
them entirely. As for their hopes of regaining
<hi>Italie,</hi> it concernes the <hi>Spaniard</hi> immediatly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then vs.</p>
            <p>Concerning the state of the Protestants in
<hi>France,</hi> during Peace they are protected by their
Edict: For their two Agents at Court defend
the Generall from wrong, and their <hi>Chambres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impartyes</hi>
euery particular person: And if trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
should arise, some scattered particulars
might be in danger, but the maine body is safe,
safe to defend themselues, though all <hi>France</hi>
ioyne against them, and if it breake out into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
the safest, because they are both ready and
vnited.</p>
            <p>The particulars of their strength are, first their
Townes of surety, two of which command the
Riuer of <hi>Loyre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, their Scituation, the greatest part
of them lying neere together, as <hi>Poictou, Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningtonge,</hi>
High <hi>Gascoigne, Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi>
neere the Sea, so consequently fit to receiue
succours from abroad, and remote from <hi>Paris,</hi>
so that the qualitie of an Armie is much wasted
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13885:14"/>
before it can approach them.</p>
            <p>The third, is the sufficiency of their present
Gouernours, <hi>Bulloigne</hi> and <hi>Desdeguiers,</hi> and other
second Commanders. And for the Princes of
the Blood, whom the rest may, in shew, without
emulation obey, when they come once to open
action, those which want a party will quickly
seeke them.</p>
            <p>The last, is the ayde they are sure of from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
Princes: For whosoeuer are friends to
<hi>France</hi> in generall, are more particularly their
friends.</p>
            <p>And besides, the Protestant partie being
growne stronger of late, as the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi>
and more vnited, as <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> part
of that strength reflects vpon them; and euen
the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> himselfe, which is Enemie to
<hi>France</hi> in generall, would rather giue them suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
then see them vtterly extirpated: And yet
no Forraine Prince can euer make further vse of
them, then to disturbe <hi>France,</hi> not to inuade it
himselfe. For as soone as they get an Edict with
better Conditions, they turne head against him
that now succoured them, as they did against vs,
at <hi>New-haven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the proportion of their number,
they are not aboue the seuenteene or eighteenth
part of the people, but of the Gentlemen there
are 6000. of the Religion; but since the Peace
they haue increased in people, as principally in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13885:14"/>
               <hi>Paris, Normandy,</hi> and <hi>Daulphin,</hi> but lost in the
Gentrie, which losse commeth to passe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that the King when he findes any Gent. that
will but hearken, tempts him with preferment,
and those he findes vtterly obstinate, suppresseth:
And by such meanes hee hath done them more
harme in Peace, then both his Predecessors in
Warre. For in all their assemblies hee corrupts
some of their Ministers to betray their Counsell
in hand; and of the 100 &amp; 6000. Crowns a yeare,
which he paies the Protestants to entertaine their
Ministers, and pay their Garrisons, hee hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the bestowing of 16000. of them vpon what
Gentleman of the Religion he pleaseth, when by
that meanes he moderates, if not gaines: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
they were wont to impose vpon him their
two Deputies which are to stay at Court, but
now he makes them propose sixe, out of which he
chuseth the two, and by that obligeth those; &amp; yet
notwithstanding all this, in some occasions hee
makes good vse of them too. For as towards <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
he placeth none in any place of strength but
firme Catholikes; so towards <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Sauoy</hi> he
often giues charge to Protestants, as to <hi>la Force</hi> in
<hi>Bearne, Desdeguiers</hi> and <hi>Boisse</hi> in <hi>Bresse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the King himselfe, hee is a person
wonderfull both in War and Peace: for his Acts
in Warre, hee hath manumized <hi>France</hi> from the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> &amp; subdued the League, being the most
dangerous plot that hath bin layd, weakening it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13885:15"/>
by Armes, but vtterly dissoluing it by wit, that
is, by letting the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> out of Prison,
and Capitulating with the heads of it euery one
a part, by which meanes hee hath yet left a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
hatred among them, because euery one
sought, by preuenting other, to make his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
the better; so that now there remaines
little connexion of it amongst the Gentrie, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there continues some dregges still among the
Priests, and consequently the people, especially
when they are angred with the increase and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie
of the Protestants.</p>
            <p>For his Acts of Peace, hee hath enriched
<hi>France</hi> with a greater proportion of Wooll, and
Silke, erected goodly Buildings, cut Passages
betwixt Riuer and Riuer, and is about to doe the
same betwixt Sea and Sea, redeemed much of
the Mortgaged Demaynes of the Crowne, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
husbanded the Money, which was wont to
bee drunke vppe two parts of it in the Officers
hands, got aforehand in Treasure, Armes and
Munition, increased the Infantrie, and supprest
the vnproportionable Caualry, and left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
vndone but the building of a Nauie.</p>
            <p>And all this may bee attributed to himselfe
onely, because in a Monarchy, Officers are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
actiue or carelesse, as the Prince is
able to Iudge and distinguish of their labours,
and withall to participate of them somewhat
himselfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:13885:15"/>
Sure it is that the Peace of <hi>France,</hi> and
somewhat that of Christendome it selfe, is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
by this Princes life: For all Titles and
Discontents, all factions of Religion there sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
themselues till his Death; but what will
ensue after; what the rest of the House of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi>
will enterprise vpon the Kings Children,
what the House of <hi>Guise</hi> vpon the House of
<hi>Bourbon,</hi> what the League, what the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
what the Kings of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi>
if they see a breach made by ciuill Dissention, I
chuse rather to expect then Coniecture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God hath so many wayes to turne aside
from humaine fore-sight, as hee gaue vs a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
vpon the Death of our late Queene.</p>
            <p>The Countrey of <hi>France,</hi> considering the
quantitie, is the fairest and richest of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
and containes in it most of the
Countries adioyning. For <hi>Picardie, Normandie,</hi>
and <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> resemble <hi>England; Languedoc,
Spaine, Province, Italie,</hi> and the rest is <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, all the Riuers that passe through it,
end in it. It abounds with Corne, Wine, and
Salt, and hath a Competency of Silke; but is
defectiue in Wooll, Leather, Mettals, and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
and hath but few very good Hauens, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
on the North side.</p>
            <p>Concerning the People; Their Children at
first sight seeme Men, and their Men Children,
but who so, in negotiating, presumes vpon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13885:16"/>
shall bee deceiued, Compassionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their owne Nation and Countrey; louing
to the Prince, and so they may haue liberty in
Ceremony, and free accesse to him, they will be
the better content that hee shall be absolute in
matter of substance; impatient of Peace any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then whiles they are in recouering the ruines
of Warre; the presentnesse of danger inflames
their courage, but any expectation makes it lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish;
for the most, they are all Imagination,
and no Iudgement, but those that proue solid,
excell; Their Gentlemen are all good outward
men, good Courtiers, good Souldiers, and
knowing enough in Men and businesse, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant in matters of Letters, because at fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
they quit bookes, and begin to liue in the
world, when indeed a mediocritie betwixt their
forme of education and ours would doe better
then either. No men stand more punctually vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Honours in matter of Valour, and which
is strange, in nothing else; for otherwise in their
Conuersation, the Custome and shifting and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerspeaking,
hath quite ouercome the shame
of it.</p>
