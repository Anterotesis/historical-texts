            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat enmity which from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning Jehovah <hi>Elohim</hi> (the Lord God) did put between the Serpent and the Woman, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their ſeed, as always, ſo now, doth work with marveilous earneſtneſs in all thoſe who in every age from their proper ſpirit are engaged by their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals, to maintain the combate to the time of the end.</p>
            <p>The Righteous is an abomination to the wicked, and the wicked is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Righteous, from the beginning to the end of this preſent evil world.</p>
            <p>For as then (even in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time) he that was born after the fleſh, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted him who was born after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; even ſo it is now in theſe laſt days, and will be ſo <hi>till the old ſerpent the Divel and Sathan, be caſt into the bottomleſs pit;</hi>

and then according to the ſcope of the Scriptures of Truth, <hi>the bond-woman and her ſon will be caſt out, and the children of the free-woman ſhall be the heirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when I ſay, <hi>So it is now in theſe laſt dayes.</hi> I deſire it may be well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for aſſuredly the Serpent and his brood will muſter all their forces, will improve all their policies, will come forth with utmoſt, inraged malice, to do the moſt miſchief they can againſt the true ſpiritnal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The freſh Auxiliaries which are uſed in this ſervice of the Dragon, that old Serpent, are the Apoſtates of the laſt times; who are ſuch Chriſtians in a form of Godlineſs, as the Devil is an Angel of Light, when he is ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, retaining his curſed proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and deſigns under the pretence of ſuch a glorious transformation.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Therefore (ſaith the Apoſtle) it is no great thing, if alſo his Miniſters be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as the Miniſters of Righteouſneſs.</hi>

            <p>Which words are, or may be, to the more cautelous Chriſtians, a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt the poyſonous infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the preſent Apoſtacy; for multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of careleſs ones have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled
<pb facs="tcp:97351:3"/>
by theſe deceitful (or cheating) workers, into a compliance with the intereſt of the Kingdom of the Beaſt.</p>
            <p>But Bleſſed be the name of our Lord Protector, the Patron of Innocency, Truth, and Righteouſneſs: that theſe <hi>deceitful workers, reſiſters of the Truth,</hi> Patrons of the carnal worldly Church, ſhall not proceed much farther; for their folly in its appointed ſeaſon ſhall be made manifeſt to all men, as the folly and madneſs of other of their brethren before them, have been made manifeſt in like manner.</p>
            <p>And (which is matter of great rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the Lords ſuffering ſervants) the Prince of the Apoſtates himſelf hath bin compel'd by the over-ruling Power of our Lord Jeſus, to defile his own neſt, to throw dirt in the face of his own Brat, to trample upon his own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with notable contempt, in the preſence of his cowardly men of war. Oh! what joy of heart is it to us to live to ſee, how in that very thing wherein they dealt ſo proudly, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periouſly, the Lord is above them, and leaves them to ſuch a degree of folly, as to ſet at nought, in ſuch notable lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage

               </gap> ye Inhabitants of theſe three Iſles of the Sea; for your Lord Protector himſelf hath lately ſet you a Pattern to pour contempt upon the whole Fabrick, both Foundation and Superſtruction.</p>
            <p>It is to be aſcribed to the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace of God himſelf, and to no other cauſe, that ſome few of us have been preſerved from that dangerous communion and conformity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with many profeſſors, well meaning ſouls, (like the followers of <hi>Abſalom</hi> of old) have been unawares ſurpriſed and intangled.</p>
            <p>That Scripture in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. the firſt five ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (which by the ſervant of Chriſt, the Author of the inſuing Treatiſe, is opened and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with two other famous Propheſies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the little Horn, and the Bottomleſs-pit-Beaſt) was made effectual to my ſpirit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to deliver me from thoſe ſnares where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:97351:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the feet of others, not a few, have been taken: faith the Apoſtle in the forementioned place (after he had made a catalogue of Characters, whereby to deſcribe the Apoſtates and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites of the laſt time) <hi>from ſuch turn away.</hi> And the firſt and laſt of thoſe Characters lay with moſt weight upon my ſpirit: <hi>Men ſhall be lovers of themſelves, covetous, proud, lovers of pleaſures more then lovers of God, having a form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but denying the power thereof: from ſuch turn away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what I ſpake publikely in a great Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, concerning the little Horn, in two general Obſervations, and nine ſpecial Characters, whereby to diſcern it from the other Horns, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom it came up, is remembred by many then preſent; ſince which, others have likewiſe given their judgements. But this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor (by what conduct of providence, time will ſhew) hath found cauſe to make thoſe two Propheſies concerning <hi>Daniels</hi> little Horn, and <hi>Johns</hi> Bottomleſs-pit-Beaſt, to ſynchroniſe, and to bring in the Apoſtacy of theſe laſt times, to accompany them in their accompliſhments. </p>
            <p>It is remarkable what is told <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 12. v. 10. <hi>Mary ſhall be purified and made white and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Surely the Apoſtates and Hypocrites of the laſt times are ſome of theſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ones: theſe will do wickedly, but they cannot underſtand. Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dwelleth not, taketh not up her reſt in the Aſſemblies, in the Counſels, of

But when that Time ſhall come, they ſhall have (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its expiration) the certain knowledge of it, by the appearing of a Little Horn, the later Apoſtacie, and a Beaſt. The particular Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of which little Horn, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie and Beaſt (as the holy Ghoſt in Scripture ſets them down) are here opened, and ſo left for the Wiſe to underſtand, by application.</p>

and the <hi>STONE</hi> begins <hi>to ſmite the Image.</hi> Many of the Lords <hi>Worthies</hi> have ſpent their ſtudie, and much time in the ſearch thereof. And no marvel, conſidering how neceſſary it is that the <hi>SET-TIME</hi> be underſtood, before any <hi>Action</hi> can ſafely be undertaken by the <hi>Saints of the moſt High</hi> againſt <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> Among others, I (who am one of <hi>the least of the flock)</hi> according<note place="margin">Jer. 50. 58.</note> to the meaſure of grace given me, have, with a broken and humble ſpirit, ſought the Lord, and <hi>ſearched diligently the Prophecies, to finde out the end of theſe Wonders.</hi> Now after much ſeeking, and long waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the great <hi>Revealer of Secrets,</hi> what I finde upon my heart (as given in I hope from God) to be Truth, I ſhall willingly make it known unto my <hi>brethren and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in tribulation.</hi> And becauſe the way which I ſhall take, hath not been (I think) obſerved before, I ſhall therefore endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my minde, and <hi>meditations</hi> of <hi>my heart,</hi> the more plainly: and will

               <p>To underſtand the <hi>Times,</hi> it is of great uſe, that the <hi>Prophetical Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> be diſtinguiſhed, and rightly applied: that is, to know what <hi>Numbers</hi> are proper to the <hi>Gentile-Chriſtians,</hi> and what to the <hi>Jews.</hi> Theſe, <hi>Viz. Until a time, times, and the dividing of time,</hi> Dan. 7. 25. So Chap. 12. 7. <hi>It ſhall be for a time, times, and half.</hi> Again, <hi>the fourty and two months,</hi> Rev. 11. 2. and <hi>the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days,</hi> v. 3. and the Witneſſes lying dead <hi>three days and an half,</hi> v. 9. So again, the 1260 <hi>days,</hi> Rev. 12. 6. and the <hi>time, and times, and half a time,</hi> V. 14. theſe <hi>Numbers</hi> (I conceive) concern the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as proper to their work and <hi>time.</hi> But the <hi>two thouſand and three hundred days,</hi> Dan. 8. 14. and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97351:31"/>
the <hi>one thouſand two hundred and ninety days,</hi> Dan. 12. 11. and <hi>one thouſand three hundred thirty and five days,</hi> verſ. 12. are to be underſtood of the <hi>Jews</hi> onely.</p>
               <p>Again, as theſe <hi>Numbers</hi> are to be diſtinguiſhed, ſo they muſt be kept apart. For the <hi>Gentiles account</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> do not (as I take it) contemporize. The <hi>Gentile-Saints</hi> will be upon their work (how long I ſhall not ſay, but) before there will be any life or viſible ſtirring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>dry bones.</hi> This to me is evident, by the order of the <hi>Vials,</hi> if well conſidered: <hi>five</hi> of the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> are to be poured out by the <hi>Chriſtian Gentiles,</hi> before the <hi>Jews awake</hi> under the <hi>ſixth Vial.</hi> And as for theſe <hi>Vials,</hi> or <hi>ſeven laſt plagues,</hi> I humbly conceive (though many good men are otherwiſe minded) that none of them are yet poured our.

               <p>It will not be known, when the<hi> fourty and two months </hi>and<hi> one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and ſixty days </hi>ſhall end, (the Time of the<hi> Beasts reign, </hi>and the<hi> womans abiding in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) </hi>until the<hi> three years and half </hi>are come. For howſoever theſe<hi> three years and half </hi>are to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the<hi> number </hi>of the<hi> one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and ſixty </hi>years; yet muſt this<hi> last time </hi>begin (yea, I think, well-nigh expire) before the<hi> Wiſe will underſtand </hi>that<hi> the ſet and appointed Time is come. </hi>This to me ſeems very clear, by the Angel's words to<hi> Daniel: But thou, O Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, ſhut up the words, and ſeal the book, even unto the Time of the end,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:97351:32"/>
Chap. 12. 4. Again:<hi> Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are cloſed up, and ſealed, till the time of the end, </hi>Chap. 12. 9.</p>
               <p>Three things are here obſervable: 1. The opening and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the <hi>Viſion,</hi> is referr'd to a certain and prefixt time; and not to be reveal'd till then. 2. In both places, it is called, <hi>The time of the End:</hi> which methinks muſt needs be, the <hi>three years and half:</hi> for I know no other <hi>time</hi> but this, that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods the number of the one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and ſixty years. 3. He faith not <hi>times,</hi> but <hi>time;</hi> intimating, howſoever the whole account ſhould have ſeveral <hi>times,</hi> or periods, (in reſpect of the divers actions of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical; and the various changes and condition of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> and <hi>Woman,</hi> all the time of his Tyranny) yet the <hi>unſealing of the Book</hi> ſhould not be, till the <hi>last time</hi> of all the ſeveral <hi>periods.</hi> So <hi>Habak.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>The viſion is yet for an appointed time: at the end, it ſhall ſpeak, and not lye.</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:97351:32"/>
What can we underſtand by the <hi>end,</hi> and the <hi>appointed time,</hi> but as <hi>Daniel</hi> hath it, <hi>the time of the end;</hi> that is, the <hi>three years and half:</hi> then is the <hi>viſion to ſpeak,</hi> and not before. So <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>For the time is at hand.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. 10. <hi>Seal not up the ſayings of the prophecie of this book: for the time is at hand.</hi> For my part, I cannot conceive what <hi>time</hi> may be taken, as diſtinct from other times, and proper to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if not <hi>the three years and half.</hi> But that in <hi>Daniel</hi> ſeems yet to be more full: <hi>It ſhall be for a time, times, and an half,</hi> Chap. 12. 7. What ſhall be <hi>for a time, times, and an half? till the end of theſe wonders;</hi> that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall be opened. As if he ſhould ſay, So far forth as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Gentiles are concerued in <hi>theſe wonders,</hi> the manifeſtation of them is reſerved, till the <hi>three years and half;</hi> and then <hi>the wiſe ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here obſerve, 1. It ſhould be no cauſe of ſtumbling unto any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that many good men have miſs'd
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97351:33"/>
of the <hi>time</hi> in their accounts, ſeeing in their time, <hi>the words were cloſed up and ſealed.</hi> 2. The cauſe of their miſtake, was not (as ſome think) of an impoſſibility, as if <hi>the time of the end</hi> were not to be known: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the appointed time,</hi> or <hi>end,</hi> was not then come, in which the <hi>viſion was to ſpeak.</hi> 3. Such as are now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the numbers of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to know when the <hi>Beasts dominion</hi> ſhall end; ought to minde whether they are come to <hi>the time of the end,</hi> in which (and not before) that great Myſtery is to be known.</p>

               <p>The way which ſome good men have taken, to finde out the period of the <hi>one thouſand two hundred and ſixty years,</hi> viz. by beginning at the <hi>head</hi> of the account, is not (in my opinion) the beſt nor ſureſt. For here we muſt credit (and depend on) humane Hiſtories, and Records of Nations; things ſo uncertain and diſagreeing among themſelves,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97351:33"/>
as nothing but conjectures and gheſſes can be concluded and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from them. And hence it is, that many have been miſled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>times:</hi> whereby others have taken advantage to condemn all, which ſearch the <hi>times,</hi> and the <hi>Prophetical Numbers</hi> of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as medling with things too high and ſecret.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould ask, Why are theſe <hi>Numbers</hi> mentioned as <hi>fourty and two months,</hi> and <hi>one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days?</hi> I anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Lord would have it known, how long the <hi>Beast</hi> ſhould reign, and the <hi>woman</hi> continue in the <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs;</hi> that his people might wait with the more faith and patience till their enlargement came. Not that when the <hi>time of the end</hi> ſhould come, he would carry them back to enquire what was done ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of years before, or ſearch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Stories for the <hi>riſe of the Beast:</hi> I take it, he hath a neerer and better way to lead them in; more free from doubts and miſtakes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97351:34"/>
then the other, and eaſier to be found out and known by babes and ſucklings: <hi>The way-faring men, though fools, ſhall not erre therein,</hi> Iſa. 35. 8.</p>

               <p>So for the <hi>Signes of the times,</hi> which are much ſpoken of, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſingular joy amongſt Saints everywhere. Theſe ſhew us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, that <hi>the kingdom of God is nigh,</hi> and that the great work of the Lord is approaching upon us: but as to the <hi>ſet time</hi> they come not home. And therefore we muſt have more light then theſe, to order our motions by. For example: be it granted, that the Lord hath a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple enquiring after the <hi>Numbers</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> much enlightned in the <hi>work of their generation;</hi> take pleaſure in <hi>Zion</hi>'s ſtones, and favour her duſt; are a <hi>willing people,</hi> and a <hi>praying people;</hi> and ſuch as have their hearts raiſed up againſt <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> to take vengeance on her. I ſay,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97351:34"/>
grant all this (as bleſſed be <hi>Jehovah</hi> it is all true, and more too) yet it will not follow, that the <hi>one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and ſixty years</hi> (the time of <hi>Antichriſts tyranny,</hi> and the <hi>Womans perſecution)</hi> muſt therefore end this year or the next. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, theſe are bleſſed <hi>Signes,</hi> and tidings of great joy; and do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declare (like the tender branches and leaves of the <hi>fig-tree</hi> that Summer is nigh) that the Lord will ariſe and have mercy upon <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and that the <hi>breaking work of the Stone</hi> is not far off: But yet they do not tell us how nigh the <hi>time</hi> is: this muſt be known ſome other way. When the <hi>Dove</hi> brought to <hi>Noah</hi> in her mouth an <hi>Olive-leaf,</hi> he knew that the waters were abated from off the earth: yet he went not forth of the <hi>Ark</hi> till the Lord did call him, <hi>Gen</hi> 8. 11, 15. Indeed theſe <hi>ſignes</hi> (like the <hi>olive-leaf)</hi> do plainly demonſtrate, that the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian deluge</hi> (which hath ſo long covered the face of the earth) is towards an end: nevertheleſs, we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97351:35"/>
muſt abide where we are, till we hear that <hi>great voice out of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſaying to the ſeven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth,</hi> Rev. 16. 1.</p>

                  <hi>Providence</hi> alone our <hi>call.

Theſe things ſhall be ſo obvious and plain, not onely in reſpect of the certain time when they did riſe; but ſo exactly agreeing in all things with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as hereby <hi>the wiſe ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,</hi> that now <hi>The Time of the End is come.</hi> Concerning this <hi>nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Time,</hi> I finde many Writers both ancient and modern to mention it; although not agreeing in their <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi> Some think theſe <hi>three years and an half</hi> ſhall be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before the ultimate or laſt Judgement: Others, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s perſonal coming to reign on earth. Others think (of which opinion I am) that theſe <hi>three years and an half</hi> (in which will be the <hi>Little Horn,</hi> the <hi>later Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie</hi> and <hi>Beaſt)</hi> ſhall be a long time before the Judgement of the <hi>great</hi>

                  <hi>day;</hi> yea, and many years before Chriſt's <hi>perſonal appearing.</hi> But howſoever in application they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; yet in theſe two great points, they agree: 1. That theſe <hi>three years and an half</hi> do period the <hi>forty and two months,</hi> and <hi>one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days;</hi> and that there ſhall be in this Time a <hi>Little Horn,</hi> a <hi>great Apoſtacie,</hi> and a <hi>Beaſt aſcending out of the bottomleſs pit.</hi> 2. Immediately after theſe <hi>three years and half,</hi> there will be a viſible and univerſal change of things tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the whole world: For the <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Horn</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, <hi>Babylon fall,</hi> all earthly powers broken to pieces, and the <hi>Saints of the moſt High</hi> raiſed up, to a moſt glorious and bleſſed eſtate. Neither is it to be thought ſtrange, that this hath been the opinion of ſome men in all ages, ſince the Primitive time, even hitherto: for if the <hi>Prophecies</hi> be read with heed and obſervation, ſo much (in my underſtanding) lies open and very clear in them.

               <p>Now for the <hi>characters</hi> of the <hi>little Horn,</hi> the <hi>later Apoſtacie</hi> and <hi>Beaſt;</hi> this muſt be heeded: Look as the Scriptures ſet them down, ſo they muſt have all their full and due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment: yea more; theſe <hi>Characters</hi> (at leaſt moſt of them) cannot be applied to any perſons or things, (without force to the Text) but onely to THAT <hi>little Horn,</hi> THAT <hi>Apoſtacie,</hi> and THAT <hi>Beast,</hi> which are to be in the <hi>three years and an half.</hi> Hence I may ſay, (though with much tenderneſs) ſome have very much wreſted the Prophecies, in applying the <hi>Little Horn</hi> to this man and that man; the <hi>Apoſtacie</hi> to be meant of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the <hi>Beaſt</hi> to be underſtood ſo and ſo: the which applications in many particulars have no ways pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd.

               <p>Though I ſhall here but ſpeak o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, what hath been hinted before; yet becauſe the <hi>Conſideration</hi> is weighty, and much to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I will adde a little. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be true, (as I am perſwaded) that the Viſions and Prophecies of the Scriptures concerning the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the <hi>Beaſts dominion,</hi> will not certainly be known till the three years and half begin, (and probably the greater part expir'd.) As <hi>Daniel</hi> knew not the deliverance of Gods people to be ſo nigh, till the very year (or leſs) in which they were delivered: ſee <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 1, 2. with <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 1. nevertheleſs when this time comes, before it expires, the knowledge of it ſhall be given in to ſome, as they are ſeeking the Lord

by faſting and prayer, and ſearching the Prophecies, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20 13, 14. This appears,</p>
               <p>Firſt, by <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>The wiſe ſhall underſtand.</hi> If the ſeries and ſcope of the place be noted, two great Truths are there ſet down. 1. The holy Ghoſt ſpeaks not of <hi>underſtanding</hi> in a large ſenſe, but reſtrains it to a ſpecial and proper <hi>underſtanding;</hi> that is, <hi>they ſhall know the end of theſe wonders,</hi> verſ. 6. As <hi>Noah</hi> knew the time when the ſloud would come, (before it came) of which the world was ignorant: ſo the end of the <hi>one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days</hi> (before it is finiſhed) ſhall be revealed to <hi>the wiſe: but none of the wicked ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</hi> 2. The <hi>wiſe</hi> ſhall not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this, till <hi>the time of the end:</hi> ſo much likewiſe is held forth in the place. The <hi>three years and half</hi> muſt begin: and to know that ſuch a <hi>time</hi> is come, there will be a <hi>little Horn,</hi> an <hi>Apoſtacie,</hi> and <hi>Beaſt:</hi> whereby the <hi>wiſe</hi> ſhall have ſuch <hi>underſtanding.</hi>

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:97351:42"/>
2. That the <hi>time</hi> will be known, before the <hi>fourty and two months</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. I think ſo much is manifeſt, by comparing <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 9. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 6. The firſt tells us, that the <hi>words are to be opened at the time of the end:</hi> now this muſt be, before the <hi>fourty and two months</hi> are expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for the other tells us, After that, <hi>there ſhall be time no longer.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if the two texts be obſerved, they belong to one matter &amp; time. The one ſaith, the opening of the Myſtery of God is left to the <hi>three years and half:</hi> the other, that it ſhall be opened before that time goes out.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I finde, that one of the <hi>four living creatures</hi> gives unto the <hi>ſeven angels ſeven golden vials full of the wrath of God,</hi> Rev. 15. 7. but theſe <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> are not bid by him to pour them out; that is done afterwards, by <hi>a voice out of the temple,</hi> Rev. 16. 1. The giving of the <hi>vials</hi> (I conceive) is the opening of the myſtery of them, as to the time when, and the work how to be done; &amp; ſo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

the <hi>angels</hi> for the execution of the wrath: and all this before the <hi>end.</hi> But their call to it, ſeems to be after <hi>the fourty and two months</hi> are expired: <hi>He hath ſhewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.</hi> Pſal. 111. 6.</p>

               <p>Now whereas ſome may object that ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>For the elects ſake theſe days ſhall be ſhortned,</hi> Matth. 24. 22. Mar. 13. 19, 20. as if this might be gathered from it, That the <hi>ſet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>time</hi> mentioned in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi>

the <hi>fourty and two months,</hi> and the <hi>three years and half,</hi> may be ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſo Gods people go forth before it be expired: I anſwer: There is (I conceive) a great miſtake in the underſtanding of that place.

            <head>THE CHARACTERS OF THE Laſt Apoſtacie, OPENED.</head>
            <p>I Know already, what the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding <hi>Reader</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from me: If the <hi>three years and an half</hi> are begun, that I ſhew him the <hi>Little Horn,</hi> the <hi>Later Apoſtacie,</hi> and the <hi>Beaſt aſcending out of the bottomleſs pit,</hi> with all their <hi>Characters</hi> ſet down in ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.

For I deſire no mans belief any further then he ſee eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing well and fairly proved.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe from the <hi>Apoſtacie</hi> (as the <hi>bottomleſs pit) the Beaſt aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,</hi>

who with his <hi>Horn ſlays the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes:</hi> I ſhall therefore begin with the <hi>Apoſtacie</hi> firſt.</p>
            <p>And here we have two Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions:</p>
            <p n="1">1.<hi> Why the Apoſtacie in </hi>2 Tim. 3.<hi> muſt be in the laſt three years and an half.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.<hi> How it appears, that the preſent Apoſtacie of our time, is that Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of which Paul ſpeaks ſhould be in the Laſt day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>likewiſe,</hi> or <hi>beſides,</hi> carries the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter back to the former<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Epiſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> chap. 4. 1, 2, 3. and his meaning being opened, it is as he ſhould ſay: In thy perſon, I ſpeak to all Saints of future ages, and would have them forewarned of <hi>two great Apoſtacies</hi> which ſhall ariſe in the Chriſtian Church before <hi>the time of the end:</hi> And theſe diſtinguiſhed, 1. By their <hi>Times.</hi> The <hi>former</hi> ſhall be in the <hi>later times;</hi> that is, <hi>when he that letteth is taken out of the way, then ſhall the wicked be revealed:</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. 7, 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meaning the <hi>Great Whore,</hi> or
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97351:48"/>
               <hi>kingdom of the Beast:</hi> the other will be <hi>in the laſt days,</hi> neer or about the period of the <hi>Beaſts dominion.</hi> 2. The <hi>former Apoſtacie</hi> ſhall be in Doctrine: <hi>Some ſhall depart from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits, and doctrines of devils, ſpeaking lyes in hypocriſie: forbidding to marry, and commanding to abſtain from meats.</hi> The later will be in manners and converſation: <hi>Men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, proud,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, that by <hi>the laſt days,</hi> the <hi>three years and half</hi> are meant, I prove it thus: The Word of God doth not onely diſtinguiſh between <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> (as <hi>there is a ſet time to every purpoſe under the ſun,</hi> Eccleſ. 3. 1.) but likewiſe ſhews, that all Prophecies have their due accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments in their fixt <hi>appointments.</hi> Thus there was a <hi>time</hi> for the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> to reign in the <hi>Romane Heathen Emperours:</hi> and that Time muſt be expired, before the <hi>firſt Apoſtacie,</hi> or <hi>Antichriſtian kingdom</hi> could ariſe: 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 3, 7, 8. So there is a <hi>time</hi> for the <hi>two Witneſſes to propheſie in</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:97351:48"/>
               <hi>ſackcloth:</hi> which time muſt be finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before they are ſlain in their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. Again, being <hi>killed in their witneſs,</hi> they muſt <hi>lie three days and an half unburied;</hi> which is another diſtinct <hi>time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Application: This <hi>later A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacie</hi> cannot be carried up to the perſecution of the Saints under the <hi>Heathen Romane Emperours:</hi> I think no man holds it ſo: Nor can it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the <hi>time of the Witneſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying in ſackcloth:</hi> for then the laſt days were not come, for there was a time after that. Neither can it be underſtood of a <hi>time</hi> after the <hi>ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth Witneſſes are riſen;</hi> for then <hi>there ſhall be time no longer,</hi> Rev. 10. 6. to wit, either for the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>ſecond Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie;</hi> but both are to be deſtroyed, and <hi>the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt; and he ſhall reign for ever and ever:</hi> Rev. 11. 12, 13, 15. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I take it (neither before nor after) the <hi>later Apoſtacie</hi> muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily contemporize with the laſt <hi>three years and half.</hi> So that <hi>three</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:97351:49"/>
               <hi>years and an half</hi> is the whole time of the <hi>later Apoſtacie,</hi> anſwerable to the time of the <hi>ſlain Witneſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the other is the <hi>great Point,</hi> How it can be proved, that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacie</hi> of this age, is <hi>that Apoſtacie</hi> of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1, 2.</p>
            <p>The matter being weighty, I ſhall ſpeak the more to it; yet with bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and tenderneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſighing for the abominations that are done in the midſt of us; and mourning for them, as the Prophets did for <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, it appears by the Scriptures, that the two <hi>great Apoſtacies</hi> ſhall in many things be like each other: the <hi>former</hi> being a Type of the <hi>later.</hi> Concerning the <hi>firſt Apoſtacie:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It had its riſe in the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, and among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Goſpel. Hence it is called, <hi>a departure from the faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. and a <hi>falling away,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 3. And of this Apoſtacy (I think) <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks: <hi>For I know this, that after my departing, ſhall grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi>

Secondly, as the <hi>firſt Apoſtacie</hi> had its riſe in the Church of Chriſt; ſo the cauſe of it was, for that men were <hi>lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, proud, &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>You that are enquiring after <hi>the Time of the end,</hi> ought to minde this: It is not the <hi>preſent Apoſtacie</hi> which is come upon us, that the holy Ghoſt fore-tells in <hi>Timothy,</hi> if it agree not with the <hi>first Apoſtacie;</hi> namely, had its beginning in the Churches of God, and among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Religion: occaſioned through <hi>ſelf-love, covetouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>pride;</hi> and hath a <hi>Head ſpeaking great things,</hi> as did the Head of the <hi>firſt Apoſtacie.</hi> For judging and applying things, this I leave to the unbyaſs'd Reader<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it being my work but to open the Prophecies.</p>
            <p>But there is one thing (and the Scripture notes it) in which theſe

two Apoſtacies agree not: The former, by reaſon of the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lyes and damnable Hereſies which were received, was a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, both from the <hi>power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and the <hi>form</hi> too: The later being a <hi>falling away</hi> not in doctrines but manners, will keep ſtill <hi>a form of godlineſs, but denying the power thereof.</hi>

But I proceed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And before we come to ſpeak of the particular ſins ſet down in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. it is worth obſerving, the <hi>vices</hi> which are not there mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97351:52"/>
as, Idolatry, Adultery, Murder, Drunkenneſs, common Swearing, and ſuch-like: And no marvel; for theſe are of ſo groſs a kinde, as they cannot well ſtand with <hi>a form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> and be defended and pleaded for, as the ſins there ſpecified. Here again the judicious Reader is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to conſider, whether this come not home to the preſent Apoſtacie: can the ſins which are left out by the Spirit of God, as <hi>Idolatry, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Murther,</hi> &amp;c. be charged upon them, at leaſt ſo eminently, viſibly, and generally, as the ſins in the text? As for the vices which are not nam'd, do they not preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and puniſh them? But for the other which are nam'd, if they are not as plainly ſeen in them, as was the leproſie on <hi>Gehaz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>'s fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; they are not the MEN meant in <hi>Timothy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So for the ſins which are expreſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we muſt not take it of perſonal fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that is, of good men, who by occaſion fall into ſuch ſins, for ſo we ſhould condemn the <hi>generation</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:97351:53"/>
               <hi>of the righteous.</hi> For who liveth, and ſinneth not? But when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, proud,</hi> &amp;c. he means ſuch <hi>MEN</hi> in whom theſe ſins do reign; and they live in them, and are under the power of them; and think it ſtrange that other men run not with them into the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of riot, and therefore ſpeak evil of them. This likewiſe muſt the Reader obſerve, that the ſins in <hi>Timothy</hi> cannot be applied to the Apoſtates of this age, unleſs <hi>they walk after their own luſts:</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 3 and are ſo far from acknowledging the evils which they have done, as that they are hardned in them, go on in the conſtant practice of them, <hi>and yet ſay, Stand by thy ſelf, come not neer to me: for I am holier then thou.</hi> Iſai. 65. 5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It was foretold by the wiſdom of God in <hi>Paul,</hi> that the <hi>firſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie</hi> ſhould be a departing from the Lord in points of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that is (as I ſaid) a turning aſide from the Truth to lyes and vanities: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:97351:53"/>
4. 1, 2, 3. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2, &amp;c. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not in doctrine, but vitious walking? I hope the <hi>Reader</hi> will minde whether this is fulfilled in our time. Are not the <hi>Tryers</hi> zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men againſt the Idolatry of the <hi>firſt Apoſtacie?</hi> They will tell you, there muſt be no inventions in Gods worſhip; but every thing muſt be according to the Pattern, <hi>viz. Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Miniſtry, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> But what ſay ye to the Characters of the later Apoſtacie? are they not <hi>lovers of themſelves, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, proud?</hi> &amp;c. I wiſh, for their own ſakes, it be not ſo. Since my thoughts were upon this <hi>Apoſtacie,</hi> I have been conſidering whether till now, from the riſe of the <hi>firſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie,</hi> it hath been known, that at any time the <hi>Officers</hi> of true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, have ſo fallen in with the world, have gotten ſuch riches, houſes, lands, moneys? have liv'd in ſuch pleaſure, plenty, riot, pomp, and ſtate? I cannot finde, that the like hath been before, and I hope after this time, it will be ſo no
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97351:54"/>
more. And indeed I ſhould have thought this thing which is now come to paſs very ſtrange, had not this Apoſtacie been foretold, that in the <hi>laſt days</hi> there ſhould be in the Churches of the Saints, and amongſt the Miniſters, Men, <hi>Lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, proud,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

And how will the

Lord make it known, That they are the <hi>Apoſtates</hi> there propheſied of? <hi>By having this form of godlineſs,</hi> that is, being men ſo forward for faſting and praying, yet living all the while in theſe groſs and ſcandalous ſins. And indeed, this here is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily added: for otherwiſe we might have look'd for <hi>the Later Apoſtacy,</hi> among Turks, Jews, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Ranters, Quakers, &amp;c. but the Holy Ghoſt would have us to obſerve, that this <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> ſhall be in <hi>Sion, Iſa.</hi> 33. 14.

            </p>
            <p>I would not be miſtaken, I am not againſt a <hi>Form,</hi> to wit, <hi>Church-Order,</hi> according to the Goſpel of Chriſt. But it is to open the words, how the man of the <hi>Later Apoſtacy,</hi> will reſt in <hi>forms,</hi> and think to ſhift

            <p>But it may be ſaid, Some are under no <hi>Form,</hi> as to <hi>Church-Order.</hi> The word as I ſaid, ſignifies a <hi>ſhew</hi> or <hi>appearance of godlineſs.</hi> Now this men may have, (and many have it) who are members of no particular Churches: theſe may <hi>faſt and pray,</hi> and in words deſire, That <hi>the Lord will diſappoint the deſigns of thoſe that labor to lift themſelves up againſt the the Intereſt of Christ and his people.</hi> And it is <hi>Machiavels</hi> Precept: <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terna ſpecie pium &amp; Religioſum vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, etiamſi ex animo non ſit:</hi> that his Scholars and Followers, ſeem to be Pious and Religious, although in Truth, and really they be not ſo.</p>
            <p>If a man have gotten any Ulcers or Sores upon his Body, he will not caſt off his Clothes to have them ſeen: but rather put on more and better to hide them. So the

But in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, as carrying the <hi>later A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy</hi> to <hi>Ranters, Quakers, Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lero,</hi> Here I diſſent: my Reaſons are:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of a <hi>State-Apoſtacie</hi> (and he calls it ſo himſelf) not meant of ſingle perſons under the power of others, and to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt at their pleaſure: But as the <hi>first Apoſtacy</hi> was a <hi>State</hi> or <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> which had a <hi>Head,</hi> and none above it, and there were Laws made ſurable to that <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> whereby to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97351:79"/>
ſupport it: So the <hi>later Apostacie</hi> is to be a <hi>State,</hi> a <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Dominion,</hi> (as <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 12. 26.) over which one <hi>perſon</hi> ſhall reign as <hi>Head,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Laws are made under this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy,</hi> ſhall be ſuteable to it, that it may not fall like the <hi>fooliſh mans houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then 2. How is the <hi>Later Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy</hi> (already come) appliable to <hi>Ranters?</hi> who have no form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, as both their Principles and Practice ſhew: we muſt finde this Apoſtacie in Churches and among great Profeſſors: men (though <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, proud, Truce-breakers,</hi> &amp;c. yet) do faſt &amp; prey, practice Church-Ordinances, and pretend great zeal and conſcience for the Intereſt of Chriſt and his people.</p>
            <p>Again, 3. How can this <hi>Later Apostacie be worſe then that under Antichrist?</hi> If underſtood of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Ranters, &amp;c. wherein are theſe men <hi>worſe</hi> then the other? it is true, the <hi>Later Apostacie</hi> ſhall be worſe then the Former, in ſlaying the <hi>Witneſſes:</hi> The former deſtroyed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97351:80"/>
good men, but not their Teſtimony. It killed the Body, but not the Truth: This <hi>Later</hi> ſhall kill the Truth, but not the Body; ſlay in moſt good men their Teſtimony and Witneſs for Chriſt, but leave their perſons unkilled. True therefore, (as he ſaith) <hi>Of the two State-Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the last is the worſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Apoſtle ſhould fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel the Later Apoſtacie to be <hi>heavy</hi> and <hi>perillous:</hi> there is little ground to apply this to poor, naked and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable perſons: Beſides, what have they done? whom have they baniſhed and impriſoned? wherein have they been Traytors? when did they change Laws and Times? All which the <hi>Later Apostacy</hi> ſhall do, and more too.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let the ſins in the Text be viewed (as I have open'd the words) and compare them with <hi>Ranters, Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. it will appear, they hold not parallel (almoſt) in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; whereas the Text (as I have ſaid) muſt not be wreſted, but ſuch an Apoſtacie found out, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97351:80"/>
with the place altogether, and in every thing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Seeing <hi>Ranters</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> err in Doctrine (as holding dangerous opinions) they come under the <hi>firſt Apoſtacie,</hi> rather then the <hi>later.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, If the evils which he mentioneth, <hi>(viz. when men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all Rules of Law and Nature, and break all bonds,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>Neither doth<hi> Paul </hi>alone ſpeak of<hi> two Apoſtacies, </hi>but<hi> Peter </hi>likewiſe, and ſets them down in the ſame manner the other doth: the firſt of things:<hi> viz. errors &amp; doctrines of devils, </hi>2<hi> Pet. </hi>2. 1, 2, 3. the<hi> later </hi>of perſons, namely,<hi> corrupt and ſinful walkers</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It is worth the heeding, how the Apoſtles begin their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies alike:<hi> This know alſo </hi>(ſaith<hi> Paul) that in the laſt dayes. Knowing this firſt </hi>(ſaith<hi> Peter) that there ſhall come in the laſt days, </hi>&amp;c.</p>

I know ſome have thought, that by the word <hi>Little, A younger brother</hi> is meant. I confeſſe there may bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it, for many do read, <hi>Cornu ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum &amp; parvun,</hi> a horn, the laſt and little; Signifying that this <hi>Horn</hi> ſhall ariſe, neer or about the time, when the <hi>Elder,</hi> or <hi>former States and Kingdomes</hi> are going down, and ready to be pluckt up by the roots.</p>
            <p>But howſoever it be <hi>Little</hi> in ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, yet it is ſaid to be a <hi>Horn,</hi> that is, a <hi>State,</hi> or <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe, it ſhall have the name and Title of a civil power or Government given to it.</p>

            <p>Touching the ſecond point,<hi> viz. </hi>that<hi> the Tyranny of the Little Horn ſhall bee in the three years and half; </hi>To prove this,

the Text<hi> ſaith, untill a time and times, and the dividing of times, Dan. </hi>7. 25.

            <p>
               <hi>Qu. </hi>But<hi> by a time, and times, and dividing of time </hi>what time is there meant, or how much is this time?

            <p>If this bee ſo (as I ſee nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it) then muſt <hi>this little Horn,</hi> be before the <hi>riſe of the witneſſes,</hi> and the <hi>forty two months</hi> are expired: for hee ſhall have no Dominion or Power after that time.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Upon the deſtruction of the <hi>Little Horn,</hi> the Saints poſſeſſe the kingdome: but this they do not, neither is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome theirs, till the <hi>witneſſes</hi> riſe, and the time of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> Tyranny is expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Hence <hi>I</hi> gather, that the <hi>three years and an half,</hi> allowed the <hi>Little Horn,</hi> and the <hi>three years and an half,</hi> in <hi>which</hi> the <hi>witneſſes lye ſlain,</hi> muſt needs contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97351:89"/>
I would have the reader obſerve this, for I think there is ſome weight in it. If the taking of the kingdom by the Saints, bee upon the <hi>ruine</hi> of the <hi>Little Horn,</hi> and the riſing of the <hi>witneſſes</hi> (as clearly it is ſo to me) then it muſt follow neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that the <hi>three years and half,</hi> given to the <hi>Little Horn,</hi> and the <hi>three years and half</hi> ſpoken of the ſlain <hi>witneſſes,</hi> are all one, ſee <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 25, 26, 27. compare <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 8. 11, 12, 13, 15, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Another Argument, I lay down thus, the <hi>book</hi> is not to bee opened, <hi>untill the time of the end;</hi> which is in the <hi>three years and half,</hi> and the underſtanding of it will bee partly by the Characters of a <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Horn.</hi> Now it is the Lords uſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner not to lead his people back to things paſt, but to teach them the underſtanding of Propheſies, by what is preſent, and doing in their own time, <hi>when yee ſhall ſee the abomination of deſolation ſpoken of, by Daniel the Prophet, ſtand in the holy place &amp;c.</hi>

4 It ſeems by <hi>Daniel,</hi> that the cauſe and ground of the <hi>Little Horns,</hi> making warre againſt the Saints, <hi>wearying them out, and ſcattering their power,</hi> will bee for bearing witneſſe to Chriſts viſible and glorious kingdome, ſo that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy now, will not bee (as formerly it was) about the <hi>Church, Miniſtery, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and diſcipline,</hi> but about the whole <hi>Rule, Dominion,</hi> and government under the Sunne, that is whether the kingdoms of the world ſhall continue (as they are) in the hands of Tyrants, and oppreſſors, or they ſhall bee Chriſts, and the Saints of the moſt high, according to that promiſe, <hi>And there was given him dominion and glory, and a kingdome, that all People, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Languages ſhould ſerve him, and his Dominion is an everlaſting dominion, which ſhall not paſſe away, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that which ſhall not bee deſtroyed.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>And the Kingdom, and Dominion, and the greatneſs of the kingdom under the whole heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt high, whoſe kingdom is an everlaſting kingdome, and all power ſhall ſerve and obey it,</hi> Dan. 7. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27. And this proves likewiſe, <hi>that the three years and half</hi> of this <hi>Little Horn</hi> muſt bee the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97351:90"/>
laſt of the <hi>one thouſand two hundred and threeſcore years,</hi> it being the laſt teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the witneſſes, in the behalf of Chriſt, and the main cauſe of their <hi>ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> by the <hi>Beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here the Reader may underſtand not onely the Time when the <hi>Little Horn</hi> ſhall ſtand up, but one manifeſt <hi>Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to know him by: under his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there will bee a large tolleration of Religion, for hee will pretend great care to tender conſciences, as that every one may have liberty to worſhip God in what form hee liſteth: onely hee will not allow that any ſhould aſſert, what the Scriptures plainly teſtify, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>breaking of the Image,</hi> and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, <hi>that hee ſhall bee ſlain, and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy deſtroyed, and given to the burning flame: The Saints ſhall take away his dominion to conſume it, and to deſtroy it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto the end,</hi> any thing but this: but this will not bee ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: no tolleration here of tender conſciences: any lye rather will be born then this truth, and how to ſuppreſſe it will bee the great buſineſſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>crafty councel will bee taken againſt Jehovah and his Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:97351:91"/>
I have handled the former points the more briefly, becauſe I think they lye open to very little exception. That which follows next is, <hi>whether the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State-Apoſtacy</hi> bee the Little Horn? I have ſaid often before, I undertake not the APPLYING PART: I ſhall onely ſhew (going over all the Characters) what this <hi>Little Horn</hi> will be, as to his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and carriage, when he comes upon the ſtage, to act a <hi>ſad tragedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold there came up among them another little Horn, Dan.</hi> 7. 8.] Though this <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Horn</hi> bee not one of the <hi>Ten;</hi> yet hee grows upon the body of the <hi>fourth beaſt,</hi> verſ. 7. and ſo is part of the <hi>Image, Dan.</hi> 2. And here I would have the Reader obſerve (which indeed hath not been heeded by Expoſitors) that the <hi>little Horn</hi> cannot be the perſons or ſtates, to which moſt men formerly have applied it: for either they have taken it for a perſon or ſtate: which was not upon the head of the <hi>fourth beaſt,</hi> as <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet, the Turkiſh Empire, Antichriſt,</hi> or one of the <hi>ten Horns, as the Norman race, William</hi> the Conqueror, <hi>Charls Stuart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp;c. And thus both wayes have miſ'd the mark. For however (as I ſaid before)
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97351:91"/>
this <hi>little Horn,</hi> is not one of the <hi>ten,</hi> yet <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them,</hi> that is, upon the <hi>head of the Beast,</hi> as the reſt are. Hence (I think) this certainly may bee aſſerted, that if <hi>the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate-Apostacy bee not the little Horn,</hi> it hath not <hi>yet riſen; For Daniels deſcript<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in this place (among them, and yet another) agrees not with any perſon or State hitherto mentioned by any writer that I have ſeen.</hi>

               <hi>Queſt. </hi>But why is he ſaid to bee<hi> among the ten Horns on the body of the Beaſt?</hi>

            <p n="2">2 That he is ſaid to bee <hi>upon the Beaſt,</hi> it is to ſhew; notwithſtanding his former Declarations and Engagements, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a long time againſt <hi>Kingſhip,</hi> when he comes to bee the <hi>Horn,</hi> hee ſhall uphold the rotten intereſt of the <hi>fourth Beaſt</hi> (as her members) namely Prieſts and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, her moth-eaten cuſtomes, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,

               <hi>Another Little Horn] Junius, Piſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> and many others tranſlate, <hi>the laſt horn, being little, achari</hi> (ſaith <hi>Willet) ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the laſt as well as another.</hi> The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Holy Ghoſt is to be minded here, in making choice of a word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſhew what this <hi>little Horn</hi> ſhall be.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Another;</hi> here is ſignified, though this <hi>horn</hi> bee a <hi>State,</hi> or <hi>Government</hi> (as was ſaid before) yet ſhall it not have the conſtitution and form of a <hi>civil State,</hi> it ſhall not have (I ſay) any ſtamp upon it, ſuitable either to a kingdome, or a Commonwealth, as the ten <hi>Horns</hi> had: for howſoever ſome of them at firſt were not fairly conſtituted, yet within a while that queſtion was taken off, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment acknowledged by the People, to bee juſt and lawful. But this <hi>little Horn</hi> for all his policy and craft, will be <hi>Another</hi> ſtill, never able to wipe off uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and Tyranny, by gaining a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal conſtitution of a State; And hence I take it hee is ſaid to bee <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſecondly, That hee is ſaid to be the <hi>Laſt,</hi> me thinks here I cannot but ſay
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97351:92"/>
with <hi>Paul, O the depth both of the wiſdom &amp; knowledge of God:</hi> As there are <hi>two Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacies, the firſt</hi> and <hi>the laſt:</hi> ſo there are the <hi>firſt Horns,</hi> and the <hi>laſt Horn:</hi> the firſt <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and the <hi>firſt Horns</hi> riſe together, So ſaith the Scriptures: <hi>And the ten Horns which thou ſawest are ten Kings, which have received no kingdome as yet; but receive power as Kings, one hour with the Beaſt, Rev.</hi> 17. 12. The <hi>Kings and Horns</hi> I underſtand to bee all one. The <hi>Roman Empire</hi> broken to peeces, that is ſeverall Nations and people caſting off the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man yoke, and conſtituting themſelves abſolute and free States: The <hi>Beaſt</hi> to be the firſt <hi>Apoſtacy, or Antichriſtian king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> now theſe two have their riſe, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at one time; ſo the laſt Apoſtacy and the laſt Horn riſe together; I hope the Reader will heed the ſweet harmony of Scripture Prophecies; ſurely it is not for nothing, that the <hi>little Horn</hi> is called the <hi>Laſt;</hi> for as the firſt Apoſtacy &amp; <hi>firſt Horns</hi> came up at one time, ſo the <hi>laſt Apoſtacy,</hi> and the laſt <hi>Horn</hi> will bee in one hour.</p>
            <p>But again (for great is the myſtery of godlineſſe) here alſo may bee meant as the <hi>little Horn</hi> ſhall not grow upon the body of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> till in the laſt <hi>daies,</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:97351:93"/>
when <hi>perillous times</hi> ſhall come, and the former <hi>Horns</hi> neer cutting, off. So he ſhall bee the laſt indeed, as verſ. 24. For I think Gods hand, will bee ſo viſible and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently lifted up againſt him, in giving his <hi>body to the burning flame,</hi> that none after him will preſume to ſet up any <hi>State</hi> or <hi>government</hi> any more upon the <hi>old Beaſt</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before whom there were three of the firſt Horns]</hi> I think it would rather darken than lighten the matter, to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſeveral opinions of men about theſe <hi>three Horns.</hi> Some (underſtand the <hi>Turkiſh State</hi> to bee meant by the <hi>little Horn)</hi> will have <hi>Aſia, Grecia,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> to be theſe three Horns. Others <hi>Egypt, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cylicia.</hi> Others <hi>Siria, Egypt</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, ſuch as take <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> for the <hi>little Horn,</hi> are various in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Some number <hi>Seleucus</hi> his elder brother, and <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſon to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and <hi>Philopater,</hi> his ſiſters ſon. Others leaving out <hi>Demetrius,</hi> chuſe <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great, father to this <hi>Antiochus</hi> the <hi>vile.</hi> And a third ſort leave it indifferent which bee nam'd. So for others applying the <hi>little Horn</hi> to the <hi>Pope;</hi> One takes it for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of this King, and that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97351:93"/>
Emperour; another for the depoſing of ſuch and ſuch: Now that which I ſhall ſay to all is this, whether wee conſider Kings or Kingdomes named by them, they were not any of the <hi>ten Horns:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they broken by a <hi>little Horn,</hi> which grew upon the <hi>fourth Beast,</hi> nor in <hi>three years and half,</hi> neither together, and at one time: Nor doth it appear by any Hiſtory, that ſo many <hi>Horns</hi> (more nor leſſe) were pluckt up by the perſons na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by them: nor that it was the laſt <hi>Horn,</hi> which grew upon the <hi>fourth Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> from the <hi>ten Horns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall propound this to the Reader, to bee conſidered and weighed by him. whether <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> are not <hi>three kingdomes:</hi> and theſe three at one time (as to their Priviledges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Laws, Rights, Freedomes, &amp;c.) broken? And whether this bee not done by men, who have the Characters of the laſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy upon them; and ſuch as call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> but never could formally put themſelves either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> And whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the time in which all this was done, were not (as probably it may be thought) neer or about the period of the <hi>forty-two</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:97351:94"/>
               <hi>months.</hi> But it is likely ſome will queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are three of the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>To this I Anſwer. 1 All know that are acquainted with Hiſtories and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, ſuch difference there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them in the enumeration of the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> whether underſtood of perſons, or States, that nothing from them can be certainly concluded.</p>
            <p>And therefore I may ſay, and as groundedly (granting there were ten diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct diviſions) that <hi>England</hi> was one, <hi>Scotland</hi> another, and <hi>Ireland</hi> a third, as others who name either this or that Countrey.</p>
            <p>But 2. My opinion is, (and ſo is the judgement of moſt) by <hi>ten,</hi> no preciſe and certain number is meant, but an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and indefinite: that is, the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> diſſolved into ſeveral <hi>States and Kingdomes.</hi> And thus was <hi>England</hi> one, <hi>Scotland</hi> another, <hi>Ireland</hi> another. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Holy Ghoſt (I think) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any thing further; But many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Countries ſhould withdraw from the Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> and become <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> free and abſolute in and among
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97351:94"/>
themſelves. So that by <hi>ten</hi> many are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as it is often ſo in ſcripture. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 22. <hi>Job</hi> 19. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pluckt up by the rootes] </hi>The Angel ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verſ. 24. ſaith,<hi> hee ſhall ſubdue three Kings, Humiliabit, </hi>ſaith<hi> Rob. Steven, and Pagnim, </hi>bring them low, or humble them, as if hee ſhould ſay<hi> three Kingdomes, which ſhall ariſe after the diviſion of the Roman Empire </hi>(I would have the reader to conſider whether theſe may not bee<hi> England, Scotland, </hi>and<hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) being by the mighty hand of God brought off, and raiſed up from a great deal of Tyranny, and arbitrary Poner, under which they were enſlaved, and having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained much of their ancient freedome, rights and Priviledges, and in a hopeful way to a thorow Reformation at home, and to have been inſtruments abroad of much good us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, in ſuppreſſing Tyranny and Idolatry: Behold on a ſudden out of the laſt Apoſtacy (as the bottomleſſe pit) up ſtarts the laſt Little Horn, </hi>who<hi> humbles them, and brings them down under the oppreſſion and bondage wherein they were before (or rather more) hinders them in going on, in the work of Reformation, and inſtead of doing good to other Nations, makes theſe three Countries
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97351:95"/>
a reproach and ſcorn every where.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now howſoever this <hi>Humbling &amp; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down,</hi> may largely bee taken. Yet, I think the holy Ghoſt chiefly intends reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious things, that is, this <hi>laſt Horn,</hi> ſhall be an occaſion of rendring the bleſſed name of God, and the cauſe of his dear Sonne, contemptible to the World: The which before, was not onely mightily cried up and pretended to, but gloriouſly held forth, as a burning light, before all people and kindreds, and Tongues, and Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In this Horn were eyes, like the eyes of a man]</hi> This may bee taken two wayes. 1 Of his Carnal Wiſdome worldly pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſubtlety, policy, making an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew to bee a great lover of Laws, of juſtice, and Equity, and the intereſt of the People, hereby the eaſier and ſooner to effect his own deſign. That he is ſaid to have <hi>Eyes,</hi> and no ſuch thing mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Ten; This I underſtand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively: For they did ſee, that is, they were crafty and politick, yet ſo, as blind to what ſight this <hi>Horn</hi> ſhall have, in all cunning devices. Hee will exceed all that were before him, both for matter and manner of deceits; their craft was ſhewed, but now and then, and onely in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97351:95"/>
ſome of their publick affairs, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, they ſtudied other things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides carnal policy, and carried on ſome of their Actions without deceit, ſimply and honeſtly. In a word, their Policies were but rough draughts at the belt. Whereas this <hi>Horn</hi> (whoſoever hee be) will mannage none of his actions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deceit, his head and heart will never bee off from ſtudying craft, and for all his projects and contrivements, they will be moſt artificial works.</p>
            <p>But 2. And this I rather take to bee the meaning. The <hi>Little Horn</hi> hath <hi>Eyes,</hi> the other none; Here is ſignified, that hee will, by a ſubtle Practice, cal'd <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Liberty of Conſcience, Gods glory the advancement of Chriſts kingdom, &amp;c. ſet up himſelf, and his own Intereſt.</hi> A thing which the ten Horns never ſaw, ſuch eyes will bee proper to this <hi>Horn:</hi> for hee ſhall joyn himſelf to the people of God, and take part with them againſt Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Idolatry, as ſeeing it to bee the way for his own advantage: As the <hi>Pope, Mahomet,</hi> and others, brought their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to paſs by ſuch <hi>Eyes:</hi> to wit religious pretences.</p>
            <p>In the ſame way will this <hi>Horn</hi> exalt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97351:96"/>
himſelf: It will not bee ſo much by carnal Policy and the Wiſdome of this World (for in this reſpect the other Horns were not blinde) but hee gets power, place, and authority, another way into his hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, by ſtanding up, for, And with a good Intereſt, and ſo gains the hearts, and prayers of Gods people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and afterwards having what hee deſired, turns <hi>his</hi> HORN, that is, his Power, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and Councel, againſt the holy People, and the good <hi>old Cauſe,</hi> by which he was firſt raiſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eyes of a man]</hi> Not of an <hi>Angel,</hi> this is added, to ſhew, that all the time of his <hi>Saint-like carriage,</hi> and when hee appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red moſt earneſtly zealous for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Chriſt and his people: like another <hi>John,</hi> his heart is not upright before the Lord, but is a very Hypocrite, even that <hi>Fool, who ſaith in his heart, there is no God:</hi> For under all his Proteſtations, Oaths, Covenants, great undertakings, &amp;c. The Plot and Deſign which hee will carry on, is how to make himſelf, and his Family great, by the ruine of that <hi>CAUSE</hi> ſo much before pretended to.</p>
            <p>In a word, that hee is ſaid, to have <hi>Mans Eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I take the meaning thus:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97351:96"/>
This <hi>Horn</hi> ſhall bee a notorious Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, a very Atheiſt, a Monſter, a monſtrous Monſter, one that ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover more Hypocriſy, and Atheiſme, (if his former and latter actions be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together) then ever was done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, by any perſon upon the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And a mouth ſpeaking great things]</hi> This is often mentioned. <hi>I beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Again, <hi>A mouth that ſpake very great things,</hi> verſ. 20. the which is afterward explained by the Angel, He <hi>ſhall ſpeak great words againſt the moſt high,</hi> verſ. 25. So indeed many Interpreters read. But others Tranſlate it otherwiſe, as <hi>Vatablu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Pagnim, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus, Ro. Steven,</hi> &amp;c. Men known to bee skilful in the Tongues: <hi>Not againſt the moſt high,</hi> but <hi>ex parte altiſſimi, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zad.</hi> On the part of the Almighty: <hi>for the Moſt High,</hi> or in <hi>his behalf. Symma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> renders it, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Hee ſhall ſpeak as the high God,</hi> That is, his words ſhall be of Holineſs, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Goodneſs, and Truth. Though in his Actions and Practice there be no ſuch thing. And if the matter be conſidered,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:97351:97"/>
there is good ground for this reading. That which doth moſt aſtoniſh <hi>Daniel,</hi> are the <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>Little Horn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there is little cauſe of Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to hear a man ſpeak wickedly, that doth wickedly. But to ſee a man <hi>make warre againſt the Saints, weary them out,</hi> by Bonds, and Impriſonment, deſtroy the Laws, Liberties, and Rights, of the People, and commit all kinde of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and yet in words to Profeſſe, hee is <hi>for God, and for the intereſt of Chriſt, and his people, and for the Priviledges, ſafety, and publick good of the Nation,</hi> this indeed is enough to amaze a Prophet. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>Graſerus</hi> rightly obſerves, this <hi>Horn,</hi> is one <hi>qui impietati ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Dei nomen pretendit,</hi> which ſhall pretend the name of God in all his Impieties. Hee ſhall not caſt a Saint into Priſon, but will pretend Gods glory for it. Hee ſhall not <hi>pluck up three Kingdomes by the roots:</hi> but will ſay it is for the honour of God. If hee break his Vows, Promiſes, Oaths, &amp;c. Really ſaith hee, it is for the ſake of the moſt high: Thus every thing hee doth, though it bee for <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>great Whore,</hi> and to keep up any baſe corrupt intereſt in the Nation, it is for Chriſts ſake, as he ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:97351:97"/>
Again, the reaſon why the word <hi>Letzad,</hi> hath been rendred <hi>againſt the moſt high.</hi> I conceive it to bee thus, the <hi>little Horn</hi> hath been taken by Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for the open profeſſed enemie of the Truth, as <hi>Antiochus Ephiphanes, Mahomet,</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> &amp;c. where as hee is a ſubtle Hypocrite, alwaies ſpeaking for God, and good things, though in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (if you obſerve him there) he ſhall plainly demonſtrate that hee regards nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God nor goodneſs.</p>
            <p>I would not have men to bee raſh and heady Cenſurers, ſpecially in the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this <hi>little Horn.</hi> For truely I think, one of the cleareſt Characters of him, is ſet forth in this place. Whenſoever this <hi>Dominion</hi> of his ſhall bee erected, if any complaint bee made againſt it, for unrighteous doings, (and for doing worſe than any men did before) what will they ſay for excuſe; <hi>ex parte altiſſimi, it is in the behalf of Chriſt,</hi> for the ſake of the godly party, to prevent new warres, and effuſion of bloud: Briefly all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleties and wickedneſſes committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and man, ſhall bee defended this way.</p>
            <p>And to ſay the truth, except it bee
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:97351:98"/>
this ſhift, they will not find a fig-leaf to cover their Nakedneſſe.</p>
            <p>And here it will not be a miſſe to give the Reader notice, that this <hi>little Horn</hi> ſhall bee ſo famous and notorious in his day, concerning the matter here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, that the ſame in ſcripture is often foretold. <hi>Your brethren that hated you, that caſt you out for my name ſake, ſaid, let the Lord bee glorified,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1 This caſting out muſt bee by a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, men who have gotten Power into their hands, and ſo are ſtronger than their brethren.</p>
            <p n="2">2 They were Brethren, either in ſome Church, Army, Councel, Parliament, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals and Companions.</p>
            <p n="3">3 How unjuſt, and ſinful ſoever their proceedings are againſt their brethren, by baniſhing ſome, or impriſoning others, &amp;c. Gods Glory is pretended, as if all were done of Conſcience, and to do God good ſervice.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Though this Apoſtate-State, thinks to cover their Malice and Cruelty by mocking God: yet God will not bee mocked, but as hee ſees their Hypocriſy and Deceit, ſo hee will diſcover it to

their everlaſting ſhame, and the honour and comfort of the other.</p>
            <p>This<hi> little Horn </hi>or<hi> Apoſtate-State, </hi>is likewiſe (as I take it) foretold by our Saviour.<hi> But and if that evil ſervant ſhall ſay in his heart, my Lord delayeth his comming, and ſhall begin to ſmite his fellow ſervants, and to eat and drink with the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.

have my Dominion (as the </hi>LITTLE HORN)<hi> taken away and conſumed: theſe things I cannot ſuffer, as being againſt the honour of God, and the good of his people; and therefore muſt correct ſuch perſons as diſturbers of our preſent Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 Notwithſtanding the ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of this <hi>wicked ſervant,</hi> as if hee did not <hi>ſmite his fellow-ſervants,</hi> but out of tenderneſs and Conſcience to the glory of God: yet this, all the while apparently ſhall bee ſeen in him, that hee <hi>eats and drinks with the drunken,</hi> all the vices and ſinnes which <hi>Paul</hi> reckons up of the <hi>Laſt-Apoſtates,</hi> are as viſibly to bee ſeen in him, as was the Leproſy in <hi>Gehezies</hi> forehead.</p>
            <p>For the cloſe of this <hi>Character:</hi> it ſeems to mee that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 5. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 48. with the <hi>little Horn,</hi> Dan. 7. and the <hi>laſt Apoſtacy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. are parallel Texts of Scripture-propheſies.</p>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97351:102"/>
nothing bee more intended, than the <hi>Horn</hi> perſecuting the Saints, they making no reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, the Holy Ghoſt (I conceive) calls it a <hi>making war,</hi> becauſe this <hi>Horn</hi> ſhall have his greateſt aid, and help by an Army; Theſe kinde of men will principally do his Commands againſt the Saints, bee they never ſo unrighteous and cruel.

Not onely may the ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> bee here meant: but this <hi>Horn</hi> ſhall proceed and proſper ſo farre in this war, as all hope will bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from Chriſts cauſe ever to riſe again. I ſhall give the Reader my thoughts of the thing. As the darkeſt time of the Night, is about the dawning, ſo a little before the expiration of the <hi>three years and half:</hi> The intereſt of Chriſt and his People will bee at the loweſt ebb, and the <hi>Horn-State</hi> at the higheſt ſpring of glory and greatneſſe: <hi>For the Lord ſhall judge his people, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent himſelf for his ſervants, when he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that their power is gone, and there is none ſhut up or left.</hi> Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> ſpeak of one thing, that the <hi>Horn</hi> will not bee to the height of his perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till his body bee ready to bee given to the burning flame, and therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall live under his <hi>Dominion,</hi> muſt expect that hee will bee moſt fierce and cruel, when the period and end
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97351:103"/>
of his time is come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſhall wear (or tire) out the Saints, of the moſt high]</hi> Here wee have the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> explanation of the words before, <hi>how hee ſhall prevail,</hi> namely, <hi>weary out the Saints,</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by keeping ſome of them under bonds and baniſhment, as thinking thereby to yre them out, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them to deny Chriſt, as himſelf had done before.</p>
            <p>Others by poverty and outward wants being forced to leave their former im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and maintenance, that they might not be partakers of his ſins. <hi>Re.</hi> 13. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>This makes mee think, that the Lord will not ſuffer him to ſhed much bloud: for howſoever hee will not fear God nor man, and bee moſt wrathſul, ſpecially towards the end of his time: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, hee ſhall but fulfil the Councell and purpoſe of God (as did <hi>Pharoah, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pontius P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>eary them out;</hi> no further (or very little) ſhall hee go, in ſpight of his <hi>Stont looks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But again, they are not onely <hi>Saints,</hi> but <hi>of the moſt high;</hi> which ſeems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that ſome <hi>Saints</hi> ſhal do well enough

under this <hi>Horn:</hi> as to their peace, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and worldly enjoyments; onely thoſe who are (not for him but) <hi>for the moſt High,</hi> he will make war againſt.

            <p>I would have the <hi>Reader</hi> likewiſe to obſerve this, as a ſpecial thing whereby to know the time of the <hi>Little Horn.</hi> There will bee then two ſorts of Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one hee will hate, the other ſeem to love: the one he will take into his Palace, the other caſt into Priſon: the one ſhall be raiſed from one degree of preſerment to another, the other thrown out of all. And the Reaſon is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the former are <hi>Saints of the moſt high:</hi> The latter are not, according to the meaning of the text: The former like <hi>Moſes</hi> will <hi>eſteem the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:97351:104"/>
               <hi>of Chriſt, greater riches than the treaſures in Egypt:</hi> The latter like <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> will imbrace the preſent world: and not care what becomes <hi>of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the moſt high,</hi> ſo they may reign as Kings themſelves in Pomp, Pride, and Pleaſure, &amp;c. with the <hi>HORN.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And think to change times and Laws]</hi> To know what is here meant, it muſt bee obſerved, what the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of this <hi>Horn,</hi> as to bee his great work and buſineſſe: and this is ſet down in two things: viz. <hi>making warre againſt the Saints of the moſt high, and plucking up by the roots three Kingdomes:</hi> ſo that as he takes twoſorts of people for his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enemies. The <hi>fift Monarchy-men,</hi> and <hi>the Common-wealth-men:</hi> ſo hee is fallen upon a <hi>deſign,</hi> whereby he thinks to keep up his Power and Dominion, in ſpight of both Parties: that it, <hi>by changing times and Laws:</hi> where note, how in the firſt hee ſhews himſelf a very Atheiſt: in the latter, a deep Polititian. We will ſpeak of both diſtinctly.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Times</hi> in this place, I underſtand the <hi>ſet Time,</hi> in which the father hath promiſed to give his ſon, and the Saints with him, <hi>the Kingdome and Dominion,</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:97351:104"/>
               <hi>and the greatneſſe of the Kingdome, under the whole heaven, Pſal.</hi> 102. 13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14. 31. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 6, 7, <hi>and</hi> 22. 10. <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 19. <hi>and</hi> 10. 1. <hi>and</hi> 11. 27, 29, 35. As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> after <hi>four hundred and thirty years</hi> were ſet free from the <hi>Egyptian bondage.</hi> And afterward delivered from the <hi>Captivity of Babylon,</hi> the <hi>ſeventy years,</hi> being expired. So the <hi>forty two months,</hi> and the <hi>one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes,</hi> and <hi>the three years and half</hi> being ſulfilled, it is Gods purpoſe to begin the deliverance of his people from Tyrants, and Oppreſſours, and to make them his <hi>battle Axe, and rod of his ſtrength to break the Image to peices, and take the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Dan.</hi> 7. 18. Now the <hi>little Horn,</hi> reading ſuch propheſies, and what great things are promiſed the Saints, after a <hi>Time, Times, and dividing of time,</hi> and when <hi>three dayes and an half are ended.</hi> And perceiving what encouragement ſome take from ſuch places, as intending to follow the call of God, when that <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time</hi> ſhall come. What doth he I (not beleeving the holy Propheſies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <hi>bee thinks to change the Times:</hi> that is, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>after three years and half,</hi> the Saints make account the <hi>Times will bee Chriſts</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:97351:105"/>
               <hi>and Theirs,</hi> he on the contrary <hi>THINKS,</hi> to have it his ſtill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to continue the <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Horn,</hi> as he was before; Yea, and to have his ſon a <hi>Horn,</hi> after his deceaſe.</p>
            <p>That the Reader may clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what my meaning is, This I think. When the dayes of the <hi>Little Horn</hi> are almoſt expired: the <hi>Wiſe ſhall underſtand,</hi> that hee is the <hi>Horn,</hi> and <hi>God will put in their hearts to fulfill his Will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, which is to take away his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to conſume it, and to deſtroy it unto the End,</hi> Dan. 7. 26. This being perceived by him, hee ſhall perſwade himſelf to fruſtrate what the Scriptures teſtify, and the Saints beleeve concerning him, by ſome crafty deviſes which he hath thought upon.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Herod</hi> (a Type of this <hi>Horn)</hi> when hee heard of the birth of the <hi>King of the Jews, gathered all the chief Prieſts, and Scribes of the people together, to know of them where hee ſhould be born.</hi> Though hee intended onely the death of <hi>the Holy Child Jeſus:</hi> yet hee ſeeks to know, what the Scriptures had foretold of the place and time; And why ſo; to <hi>change the time,</hi> that is, to make void the Councel of God. The like may be done
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97351:105"/>
by the <hi>Little Horn:</hi> being <hi>Troubled</hi> to hear, that Chriſt is appearing againſt him, <hi>to take away his Dominion,</hi> hee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the <hi>Prieſts and Scribes</hi> together, and inquires of them about the Time: who can inform him, (ſome of them at Leaſt) that after <hi>three years and half,</hi> the <hi>Horn</hi> muſt bee deſtroyed: what doth hee now? <hi>Thinking to change the Time,</hi> hee doth all that hee can, by power and craft to eſcape the revenging hand of God.</p>
            <p>Again, it is worth the noting, though the <hi>chief Prieſts and Scribes,</hi> had not the Grace, to go with the <hi>Wiſe men</hi> unto Chriſt, yet had they ſo much knowledge in the Scriptures, as they could tell the Tyrant, the place where hee ſhould bee born, whereby to further his bloudy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
            <p>So ſome Miniſters of the laſt <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> by the light which they have of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of the Laſt Times, may bee able to inform the <hi>Horn,</hi> when his <hi>three years and half</hi> are ended, and yet remain ſtill with him, and not go forth with the <hi>Wiſe</hi> to follow the <hi>Lamb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> How will hee <hi>think to change the Times,</hi> that it may not bee Chriſts

time, but <hi>His</hi> after the <hi>three years and an half</hi> are expired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> My opinion is, theſe three wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1 As <hi>the Saints of the moſt high</hi> will riſe in their Teſtimony againſt him (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially about the <hi>Time of his End:)</hi> So on the other hand, hee will ingage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted Profeſſours, to appear for him more than they did, in juſtifying his Government and wayes: aſperſing their <hi>Diſſenting Brethren,</hi> to ſpeak things, of ſpight, ignorance, Prepoſterous zeal, <hi>and what will they have? men may be as good as they will,</hi> &amp;c. And thus getting the <hi>Apoſtates</hi> every where to cry him up, for a <hi>Nurſing Father, and his Government, the prop and pillar of Religion, he will think to change the times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a little before <hi>Iſraels</hi> deliverance out of <hi>Egypt, Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Magitia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> had a ſore conflict; and the like between <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Baals Prieſts,</hi> a little before they were put to death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So I conceive, a little before his <hi>Dominion</hi> is taken from him, the Controverſy will grow high between the Witneſſes of Chriſt, and Apoſtates, on whoſe ſide the Truth is.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:97351:106"/>
2 <hi>Hee will ſcatter the Power of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people,</hi> grow ſo high in Pride and Stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, neer his end, that it ſhall ſeem <hi>their Power is gone, and there is none ſhut up or left.</hi> So farre ſhall hee prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>remnant of the womans ſeed;</hi> that having before <hi>ſtain the witneſſes,</hi> hee ſhall think there are <hi>none left,</hi> either in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or out of Priſon, to take away his <hi>Dominion, and caſt his body to the burning flames, when the three years and half are expired.</hi> As the ſcum and droſſe is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off, and thrown into the fire, when it hath ſpread it ſelf over the Pot, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the liquor ſeen: ſo the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this <hi>Horn</hi> will bee, when he thinks hee hath the cauſe of Chriſt down under him, and no appearance or ſight thereof is left, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 119.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, Hee thinks to <hi>change the Times</hi> by his Army: And indeed his greateſt hope will bee in this.</p>
            <p>For firſt, The Army muſt bee purg'd, that is to ſay, not a conſcientious Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier left in it, ſpecially an Officer: not a Man if known that his Principles are for <hi>ſmiting the Image.</hi> Secondly, Such mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinary fellows ſhall bee raked together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as like the <hi>Turkiſh Janazaries, and Spaniſh</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:97351:107"/>
               <hi>ſlaves</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> they will ſerve his turn in any thing. As thoſe <hi>Bloud-ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> which are applied to mens bodies. Whereſoever they are laid (be the place well or ill) there they ſtick, and do the work they are applied for: So the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of this <hi>Horn,</hi> whatſoever they are Commanded, that they will do, bee the party good or bad, ſick or ſound, all is one to them: The will and Luſt of their great Maſter ſhall bee obeyed, though it bee againſt the expreſſe Law of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Their main buſineſſe is now, to hunt after <hi>the Saints of the moſt high,</hi> break their meetings, and impriſon ſuch as they think might promote the intereſt of Chriſt, and his people, againſt the <hi>Little Horn,</hi> had they liberty. Fourthly, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable hee will cauſe his ſouldiers to take away from ſome of the <hi>Fift Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy-men,</hi> their Armes, and Weapons, not leave them a Sword, Musket, Piſtol, Pike, &amp;c. it may bee not a Horſe, nor Money to buy them bread: And hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done all this, now hee thinks (and hath hee not reaſon for it) he hath <hi>chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is obſerved by ſome, when <hi>Ahab</hi> was told by the Prophet, that the Lord
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97351:107"/>
would <hi>bring evil upon him, and cut off his poſterity,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 21. that hee takes more Wives and Concubines, and begets no leſſe than <hi>ſeventy Sons,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 1. Thinking thereby either to have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what the Lord had threatned, or to make him the more work: So the <hi>Horn</hi> underſtanding, that his Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is to bee deſtroyed: now hee will beſtir himſelf: deviſing and practiſing all hee can, either to croſs the Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree againſt him <hi>(change the Time,)</hi> or put him hard to it. <hi>Thus vain man would be wiſe, though man bee born like a wild aſſes colt.

            <p>For the other particular: Wee are to conſider 1 What is meant by <hi>Laws?</hi> 2 How <hi>he thinks to change them?</hi>

2 A change in all <hi>Fundamentals.</hi> As to that <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> which is in the people, to chuſe their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> own <hi>Repreſentatives,</hi> and the <hi>Priviledges of Parliaments.</hi> Theſe two things hee will <hi>pluck up by the roots, viz.</hi> take away from people and Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments, their power and priviledges: and aſſume all to himſelf: yea, ſo Arbytrary and Lawleſſe will hee bee herein, that never a Tyrant before him (governing the Nations where hee ſhall bee) ever durſt to attempt the like. And ſo much the Reader is to obſerve: For my minde gives mee, whoſoever doth not this, hee is not the <hi>little Horn</hi> in <hi>Daniel. If the foundations be deſtroyed, what can the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous do?</hi> Pſal, 11. 3.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Such <hi>laws</hi> as were made for every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual perſon, wherby every private man before had ways and means to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in caſe of wrong and oppreſſion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it concern'd his perſon or Eſtate: But <hi>theſe</hi> hee will make void, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof his Will ſhall be for a Law, as to impriſon and baniſh whom he will, and keep them there as long as hee will: And to take mens Goods and Eſtates from them, when, and how much hee pleaſeth: So that onely his will, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97351:108"/>
nothing elſe ſhall be a Law for men to walk by, and truſt to, neither will they have any other defence (whiles this Horn raigns) to preſerve themſelves and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies from ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt. </hi>But how doth hee<hi> think thus to change the Laws?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 <hi>Ex parte altiſſimi,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of God, as following providence and neceſſity, and that he could do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to preſerve the Nations in Peace: Eſpecially the godly party, and tender Conſciences, who above all earthly things hee hath a fatherly care of. And this will bee (in the time of the Horn) the greateſt plea among Apoſtates. How much it concern'd the honour of God, and the intereſt of Chriſt, and his people, to take away from the People their Power, and from Parliaments their ancient Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges: Remove foundations, lay the Law aſide, and Rule by Will and Luſt, leave the People nothing to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from violence and wrong, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their Perſons, or Eſtates: yea, the Impudence of <hi>Turn-Coats</hi> and Hypocrites at this time will bee ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that whoſoever grieves and Complains becauſe the Laws are changed, ſhall bee branded for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97351:109"/>
men that ſeek themſelves, and are diſcontented becauſe the Power is not in their hands.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Whereas it is ſaid hee will <hi>change Laws,</hi> the meaning ſeems to bee, when hee hath laid the former aſide, hee will (to uſe the Scripture phraſe) <hi>Invent to himſelf the INSTR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MENT of a fooliſh ſhepheard:</hi> ſtuff up ſome thing (as <hi>Michal</hi> did the <hi>Bolſter</hi> with <hi>goats-hair)</hi> and lay it in the place of the other. Not that hee ſhall think what hee hath done, is worth any thing (for he will laugh at it himſelf, and before the three years and half are expired, call it all to nought) But as men to quiet fools and children, when they have taken good things from them, put a <hi>bable</hi> or <hi>trifle</hi> into their hands: So it is ſome <hi>BABLE</hi> or <hi>Trifle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which hee will give the People: of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (as Children and fools) to ſtill them and that they may not cry after the <hi>GOOD OLD LAWS</hi> which hee hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 My Opinion is (when this Horn ſhall reign) in changing the Law, he will do as D. <hi>Alva</hi> did, chuſe a <hi>Councel.</hi> And in this hee will be very ſubtle, as taking the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (whom hee will have to be of his
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97351:109"/>
Councel) out of ſeveral ſects and parties. It may bee from the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> one, from the <hi>Independents</hi> two or three, and ſo from the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Cavileers,</hi> more or leſſe.</p>
            <p>By which means hee makes account that his <hi>changing of the Law:</hi> will be the ſooner allowed by all ſides and ſects.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In this <hi>change of the Law,</hi> he will make uſe of <hi>Corrupt Lawyers:</hi> a thing ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to bee done (for I verily think when this <hi>Horn</hi> ſhall rule, there will bee few Lawyers but as rotten as dirt) Theſe Wretches and Traitours to God and their Country (to have preferment and places under him, and to keep up old rotten Cuſtomes and Corruptions in the Law) <hi>will bend their tongue like their bow for lyes:</hi> Countenance him, and go along with him, in the worſt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, contrary to all Law, and againſt their Knowledge, and Conſcience, and Oathes which they had often taken. To this might bee added, what a watchful Eye the <hi>Horn</hi> will have on ſuch, as ſhall appear for Laws and Freedome of their poor Countrey, not onely thruſt them out of place and practice, but impriſon them, and poſſibly more too (when that time
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:97351:110"/>
is) before it do expire. But</p>
            <p n="5">5 And Laſtly, as no People have had their <hi>Laws changed,</hi> and an Arbytrary Power ſet over them, and ſo enſlaved to the unlimited Commands of ſome men, but it hath been by the <hi>Power of the ſword:</hi> ſo queſtionleſſe, whatſoever this <hi>Horn</hi> ſhall do, he will do it by an <hi>Army,</hi> which will readily put in execution all his <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Appointments,</hi> bee they never ſo unreaſonable, illegal, and unjuſt, as was ſaid before.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Chriſts enemy, Mat.</hi> 13. 25. that <hi>he ſowed Tares among the wheat:</hi> Hee pluckt not up the <hi>wheat,</hi> though he mixed his <hi>Tares</hi> with it. But this <hi>Horn</hi> doth worſe: For though other <hi>Tyrants</hi> before him, <hi>ſowed Tares,</hi> that is, brought in many things which were Arbytrary, and Illegal: yet they pluckt not up the <hi>Wheat:</hi> but this <hi>MIGHTY MAN</hi> will not leave any good Corn ſtanding: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his bitter <hi>Tares</hi> for the people to feed upon.</p>
            <p>But for all this, the Holy Ghoſt tells us, he doth but <hi>think to change Times,</hi> and <hi>Laws:</hi> for no ſuch think indeed can hee do. But like a man in his ſleep, dreams hee hath great things, and when
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97351:110"/>
hee awakes findes it altogether otherwiſe. So will his actions bee, hee builds Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in the Air, promiſeth a great deal to himſelf, but <hi>hee that ſits in heaven, do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h laugh him to ſcorn,</hi> and will ſcatter this <hi>proud Horn</hi> in the imagination of his heart. So that in the <hi>three years</hi> and half, nothing is done for him (as to the <hi>chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Laws and times,</hi> though his own creatures bee imployed in the work, read <hi>Pſalm</hi> 52. <hi>and</hi> 75. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 9, 10. as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to this.</p>
            <p>That it was no more but <hi>Thinking</hi> in reſpect of <hi>changing the Times,</hi> will appear by and by, when wee come to ſpeak of his End. Neither will it bee more than thinking, in reſpect of <hi>changing Laws:</hi> For never ſhall he bee able to <hi>eſtabliſh his Government:</hi> nor will any of his Acts or <hi>Ordinances</hi> (made by him in the <hi>three years and half)</hi> bee acknowledged for <hi>LAW,</hi> when that ſhort time is expired, but thrown out as things execrable and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable.</p>
            <p>This too, is very conſiderable; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the main work of the <hi>Horn,</hi> in the <hi>three years and half,</hi> will bee about his own intereſt, how to ſecure himſelf and ſettle the Government of the <hi>three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

So that hee is but a <hi>THINKER</hi> and <hi>DREAMER</hi> at moſt: Nothing ſhall hee bring to paſs for his own turn and purpoſe.

            <p>
               <hi>And they ſhall bee given into his hand] </hi>This may be meant</p>
            <p n="1">1 Of God, by whoſe ſufferance the <hi>Horn</hi> ſhall proſper, <hi>yea take root and grow</hi> as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 2. and ſo doubts not, but to bring to paſs all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes in reſpect of <hi>changing both Times, and Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>They ſhall bee given him by men,</hi> viz: <hi>the Apoſtates of that time:</hi> And theſe the moſt eminent and heads of the people,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97351:111"/>
whether Miniſters, Magiſtrates, Lawyers, Souldiers. <hi>It was told David, that Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel was among the Conſpirators with Abſolom.</hi> Hee had but one <hi>Ahitophel</hi> with him, this <hi>Horn</hi> will have many, ſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and crafty foxes. But I wiſh them a better end. So then by this <hi>giving,</hi> is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that he will plead Right to his <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Government,</hi> as appointed thereto by God and man, no Intruder or Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: neither in attempting to <hi>change times and Laws,</hi> doth he more, then he hath war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ground for it.</p>
            <p>I would have this likewiſe to be heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: whoſoever this <hi>Horn</hi> is, hee will plead hard for the lawfulneſſe of his power, as <hi>Given by God and man into his hand.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in truth, hee receives it from Gods only permiſſively. As a Theif may take a purſe from men by force and fraud.</p>
            <p>Thus I have done with the <hi>Little Horn</hi> as to his <hi>Action:</hi> That which follows is his <hi>ſuffering.</hi> Thus the Spirit of God gives us a <hi>full hiſtory of his life and death.</hi> In his end and puniſhment wee may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. 1 The Time. 2 The Author. 3 The Inſtrument. 4 The Judgement it ſelf. And laſtly, How and in what manner. Some thing I will ſpeak
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97351:112"/>
(though briefly) to each particular.</p>
            <p>For the Time] It will be immediately upon the expiration of the <hi>three years and half.</hi> Though the Lord did not ſhorten the term of his peoples abode in <hi>Egypt</hi> (viz. <hi>four hundred and thirty years, Fxod.</hi> 12. 41.) nor their <hi>ſeventy years captivity in Babylon,</hi> but let it run out to a day: yet being out, hee preſently delivered them according to his promiſe: So the <hi>little Horn</hi> ſhall have his full time of <hi>three years and half</hi> (bearing date from the day he was conſtituted a <hi>Horn)</hi> but no more may hee expect, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it. <hi>Bee ſilent O all fleſh before the Lord: for hee is raiſed up out of his holy habitation,</hi> Zach. 2. 13. This Time contemporiſes with the <hi>womans ſecond comming out of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,</hi> Rev. 12. 14. <hi>and the riſing of the witneſſes, Rev.</hi> 11. 11. and with that <hi>ſet Time</hi> in the Prophet, Pſal. 102. 13. So likewiſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 1. <hi>And I heard a great voice out of the Temple, ſaying to the ſeven Angels, go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God, upon the earth. And the firſt went and poured out his vial upon the earth, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is an Alluſion to Souldiers, who
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:97351:112"/>
are ready to charge and fight the enemy, but do it not till they have the word of Command. So Gods people will bee prepared for the work, before the years bee expired. But as no word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand will bee given them to go out, till then: ſo they will wait (as a people prepared for the Lord) untill that time ſhall come.</p>
            <p>But howſoever by the Scriptures we may know the beginning of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet how long the time will bee in the execution, that is not certain; but probably a very ſhort time, yet ſo, as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually. Firſt, A dawning, and afterwards the light more and more appearing.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>For the Time,</hi> The <hi>Little Horn</hi> is to bee deſtroyed before the other ten. <hi>I beheld till the beaſt was ſlain, and his body deſtroyed, and given to the burning flame, As concerning the reſt of the Beasts, they had their Dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a ſeaſon and Time,</hi> Dan. 7. 11. 12. The meaning I take to bee thus. The Term of the <hi>ten Horns</hi> do expire with the <hi>little Horn;</hi> and in that reſpect, their <hi>Dominion is ſaid to bee taken away: yet their lives were prolonged:</hi> that is, their Power and Government is not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:97351:113"/>
to bee broken to pieces, till the <hi>little Horn</hi> bee firſt conſumed. Hence it is that the <hi>little Horn</hi> or <hi>State-Apoſtacy,</hi> (for I tak it to bee all one) is the ſubject of the firſt <hi>vial,</hi> as I have ſhewed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedelſewhere.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why is the little <hi>Horn</hi> to be deſtroyed before the other <hi>ten?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> overthrew <hi>Moah</hi> and <hi>Ammon (Lots</hi> poſterity and neer of kin to them) becauſe they ſought to hinder them from going into the good Land, to fight the Lords Battles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Kings of Canaan.</hi> So this <hi>Horn</hi> (by profeſſion a brother) in that hee will hinder the Saints of the moſt high, from going forth againſt <hi>Babylon, and the Kings of the earth,</hi> it is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous thing with God that hee ſhould fall firſt by the hands of the mighty <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es,</hi> Iſa. 63. 1, 2, 3, 6. I take the meaning thus, The Lord will ſmite <hi>Edom</hi> firſt, that is, <hi>falſe brethren and Apoſtates,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tread down other people in his anger.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This <hi>Horn</hi> and <hi>latter Apoſtacy,</hi> is a <hi>luke warm State, neither hot nor cold,</hi> and therefore the Lord will ſpue it out of his

mouth, not <hi>cold</hi> becauſe it hath a form of godlineſſe, not <hi>hot,</hi> becauſe <hi>it denies the power of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A thing offenſive to the Stomack can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee born, but a man will bee rid of it as ſoon as may bee.

            </p>
            <p>And here Gods order in pouring out the <hi>laſt Vials</hi> is to bee noted: he will not begin with <hi>Spain, France, Germany,</hi> &amp;c.

Not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this, great miſtakes have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout former warres, in bringing them under the <hi>Vials,</hi> as the <hi>Sweden, Engliſh, Holland,</hi> to the <hi>ſecond, third, and fourth vials.</hi> Whereas to mee it ſeems clear by
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97351:114"/>
Scripture, the firſt thing which will bee done in fulfilling the Prophecys of the laſt times (I ſpeak of warre) is the cutting off of this Horn, and nothing will bee done againſt <hi>Babylon and the ten Kings</hi> (as the proper work which the <hi>hundred forty and four thouſand,</hi> and the called choſen, and faithful ſhall bee put upon) till this thing be done.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For the <hi>Author</hi> of his judgement?

            <p n="1">1 Here is ſhewed, that the Lord will give him no more time, nor bee patient any longer, neither ſuffer him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any further in his Tyranny, and Hypocriſy, but ſet all his former ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face, and tear him in peeces, and there ſhall bee none to deliver him.

            <p n="2">2 That <hi>the Lord from his Throne judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him.</hi> Here is ſignified, what God is about to do: <hi>viz.</hi> deſtroy Tyrants and all unrighteouſneſſe of men, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Peace and Righteouſneſſe in the earth: And indeed now is the way made for it, and never the like before in the World. <hi>Open yee the gates, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Nation which keepeth the Truth may enter in,</hi> Iſa. 26. 2.

            <p n="3">3 This ſhews, that the <hi>Saints in taking away his Dominion, and caſting his body to the burning flame,</hi> ſhall therein do no more but what is juſt and right, and what ought to be done.

            <p n="4">4 The work it ſelf, (they think) will not admit of any but Saints. For, Firſt, It is to deſtroy all manner of ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſſe in perſons and things. Secondly, It ſhall bee done fully and faithfully, not by halves, and haltingly, as things formerly were, which cannot bee ſo, if prophane perſons ſhould bee uſed. Thirdly, The work is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Chriſts and for Chriſt, that hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone may bee exalted, and therefore ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unlikely it is that hee will bee behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to his Enemies for it. Fourthly, It is a work that requires ſpiritual principles: neither can it bee done without Faith, which wicked men have not. Thus ſome.</p>
            <p>Howſoever I do agree with theſe men. that <hi>the Kingdome-work</hi> ſhall bee in the hands of Saints, and by them managed, and carried on: And therefore called <hi>the Warre of the Lamb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet two things are to bee minded.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Though they ſhall all have (I think)
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97351:118"/>
the Characters of viſible Saints, yet not all alike: Some will bee <hi>weaklings,</hi> men very low, and of little light, and life, to the work, to what others have: and yet received. Again Secondly, howſoever in the judgement of Charity all may bee reputed <hi>Godly,</hi> yet there may be ſome not enlightned further, than for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Civil things: And in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, to wit, upon <hi>Common-wealth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> will joyn with their brethren, <hi>the fift Kingdome men,</hi> againſt the <hi>Little Horn, and Babylon,</hi> thereby to recover their Ancient Liberties and Rights. As the <hi>Two Tribes and half,</hi> went armed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Jordan,</hi> before their Brethren, and left them not, till the other <hi>Tribes</hi> were ſet and ſetled in <hi>Canaan;</hi> and then retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back to the Country which they had choſen. So it is probable, ſome who have choſen the <hi>Land on this ſide Jordan</hi> (I mean) <hi>COMMONWEALTH-PRIVILEDGES</hi> will not onely joyn with their Brethren, whoſe <hi>Lot</hi> is on the other ſide: but it may bee, bee before them in the Warre: and when the <hi>Canaanites</hi> are ſubdued, will be content to ſit down in their <hi>Lot</hi> of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome ſay, that Saints ſhall
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:97351:119"/>
not deſtroy the <hi>Little Horn,</hi> nor the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> neither the <hi>Image, Babylon,</hi> &amp;c. neither muſt they (as Saints, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the cauſe and Kingdome of Chriſt) make Warre at all. But ſuffer all things, and bee patient under Tyrants and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſours, till Chriſt himſelf appear, and march in the head of his Army.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Ziphites</hi> had treacherouſly betrayed <hi>David,</hi> unto <hi>Saul,</hi> what ſaith the Tyrant? <hi>bleſſed bee yee of the Lord, for yee have compaſſion on mee,</hi> 1 Sam. 23. 21.

            </p>
            <p>That much work ſhall bee done by <hi>Saints</hi> (as <hi>Saints)</hi> and upon the account of the <hi>fift Kingdome,</hi> before Chriſt perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, I prove thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1 Chriſts perſonal comming will not bee, till after the pouring out of the <hi>ſixth Vial, at the great battle of Arma-geddon,</hi>

againſt <hi>Gog and Magog,</hi> ſpecially in the Jews behalf, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>and</hi> 19. 11, 12. &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. 12. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1.

            <p n="2">2 The <hi>Ten Kings</hi> which ſhall <hi>hate the Whore, and make her deſolate, &amp;c. Rev.</hi> 17. 16. do not this, untill the <hi>Lamb overcomes them,</hi> verſ. 14. Now by the <hi>Lamb, Chriſt perſonally,</hi> cannot bee underſtood, but his powerful preſence with his <hi>called, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and faithfull,</hi> as inſtruments in that work. For if Chriſt overcome them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, how can it bee ſaid, that they afterward have burnt the Whore, and yet Chriſt not come; Reader note this, it ſeems clear by the Scripture, that the <hi>Whore</hi> (I mean the State and Dominion of the <hi>Beaſt)</hi> muſt fall by the <hi>ten Kings,</hi> before Chriſt come in perſon, ſee <hi>Revela.</hi> 18. with Chapter 19. 1, 2, 3, 4. where the Lord is praiſed for that victory, and this is before Chriſt appears, verſ. 11, 12. &amp;c.

            <p n="1">1 <hi>The Beaſt is ſlain.</hi> This reſpects the <hi>Souldiery.</hi> And probable it is, that many of them will be <hi>ſlain.</hi> For howſoever the greater part of them (at leaſt the better part: ſuch as have any thing of God left in them) will lay down their arms, and forſake him neer his end: yet ſome deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and prophane wretches (newly raiſ'd) will ſtand it out, and ſo fall by the ſword of the Lord in the hand of his mighty ones.

            <p>
               <hi>And his body destroyed]</hi> This ſeems to bee another kind of puniſhment; as

beheading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hanging, and putting to death by a <hi>Judicatory,</hi> and the word imports ſo much. This follows the ſlain Army. But who is the <hi>body of the Horn?</hi> The <hi>later Apoſtacy</hi> of which we ſpake; ſo that <hi>Judgment will now begin at the houſe of God, at the ſanctuary.</hi> Woe now to Apoſtates; <hi>Woe to you Scribes, and Phariſees, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,</hi> The Lords day is upon you: ſuch as did juſtifye and encourage the <hi>Horn,</hi> when hee <hi>thought to change Times and Laws.</hi> Acted unrighteouſly under him, Executed his unlawful Orders and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands againſt the <hi>Saints of the moſt High,</hi> made to themſelves, an advantage of his Tyranny and Oppreſſion: Oh how are the ſinners in Zion afraid, and fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſurprized the Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>Now Church members, and Church Officers, are likely to experience, the ſoul that ſins ſhall dye, and that the righteous God loves Righteouſneſſe: And it is not, faſting, praying, propheſying, &amp;c. will deliver corrupt men, and ſuch as have baſely betrayed the cauſe of Chriſt, in the day of the Lords wrath, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 2, 3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 14. &amp; 66. 5.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It remains now to ſhew how, and in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:97351:124"/>
what manner it ſhall bee done? To take the Scripture for our light. It ſeems thus: When the <hi>three years and half</hi> are fully expired, <hi>the wiſe ſhall underſtand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that hee is the <hi>Little Horn</hi> foretold in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and to bee deſtroyed: and this <hi>light</hi> ſhall ſpread it ſelf among <hi>the Saints of the Moſt High:</hi> yea, ſo clear and certain will the thing bee (they having the word of God and his ſpirit for it, providence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe leading the way) that they ſhall pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely declare, what they intend to do, The work beginnes with an <hi>Earthquake, Rev.</hi> 11. 13.

Few abiding with him, unleſſe deſperate men, and ſuch who are ſo deeply ingaged with him, as have no hope to ſave themſelves, (from bodily puniſhment) by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>The Saints knowing the <hi>ſet Time</hi> is come, that <hi>the Lord will have mercy upon Zion;</hi> and being called out of the <hi>Temple,</hi> to pour out the <hi>Vial</hi> upon the <hi>Earth-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy</hi>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:97351:124"/>
(being ready) go forth in the Name and ſtrength of the Lord. And though they may have ſome oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at firſt, yet I think they will be Conquerors at laſt without much loſſe, I ſay fighting for the <hi>Lamb;</hi> For ſo wonderfull will the preſence of God bee with them, and ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the enemy, that this warre will bee ſhort, and none of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter once broken to peices, will durſt lift up their hands any more in the <hi>Horns</hi> behalf.</p>

               <hi>And when they ſhall have finiſhed their Teſtimony, </hi>Rev. 11. 7.]</p>
            <p>That is, <hi>Near or about the time of finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Teſtimony.</hi> And ſo the words are rendred by many Interpreters. It is true, ſome think, the <hi>three years and a halfe,</hi> are not to be reckoned with the 1260 <hi>years,</hi> but apart from that account. But (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks) this cannot be: For the 42 <hi>months</hi> being expired, <hi>the Saints take the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> And ſo I underſtand <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 6.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:97351:126"/>
               <hi>There ſhall be time no longer.</hi> But when is that? When the 1260 <hi>years</hi> are ended, the myſterie of God is finiſhed, as to the reign of the <hi>little Horne,</hi> and <hi>Tyrannie of the Beaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> not to ſcatter the Saints, and kill the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> any longer. But the <hi>Woman</hi> comes out of the <hi>Wilderneſſe,</hi> and the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes aſcend up into Heaven,</hi> and fire comes forth from the Lord to devour the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. But whether we take <hi>the three years and an halfe,</hi> in the number of the 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> or a part, it is all one to the matter here. Howſoever I think it periods the firſt account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Beaſt that aſcendeth out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Pit]</hi> rather <hi>depth</hi> or <hi>gulfe,</hi> for <hi>pit</hi> is not in the Text, nor in <hi>Cha.</hi> 17 8. but <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 1. it is.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> here, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that <hi>Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13. 1. which is ſaid <hi>to riſe up out of the Sea;</hi> for he is to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue 43 <hi>months,</hi> that is, 1260 <hi>years,</hi> v. 5. But this riſeth not till that terme be near expired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> onely <hi>three years and halfe</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And ſo much the Text plainly holds forth. <hi>When they ſhall have finiſhed their Teſtimonie, a Beaſt aſcendeth out of the depth,</hi> &amp;c. Not the <hi>Beaſt</hi> which was riſen
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:97351:127"/>
before, <hi>but a Beaſt now comes forth.</hi> Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that purpoſely and for no other end (as it were) <hi>he aſcendeth out of the gulf, then to ſlay the Witneſſes when they have finiſhed their Teſtimony.</hi> Hence I think this may be aſſerred for a Truth, Whoſoever this <hi>Beaſt</hi> is, it cannot be the <hi>Dominion of the Papal Beaſt,</hi> nor can the <hi>German Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> be meant, nor any of the <hi>ten Hornes</hi> or <hi>Kings;</hi> for theſe were riſen long before <hi>the Witneſſes had finiſhed their Teſtimony.</hi> The matter here is of weight, and being well conſidered, will give us ſome light to know who this <hi>Beaſt</hi> is, and where the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſhall be ſlaine: The <hi>Popes Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> it cannot be, nor the <hi>Emperours, Spaniard, French,</hi> &amp;c. theſe roſe before the <hi>three years and an halfe,</hi> and have ſtood many hundred years.</p>
            <p>It is a common received opinion; In the Lords bringing <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was ſhadowed out the deliverance of his Church and people, from all Tiranny and oppreſſion in the laſt dayes. Now of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> (a Tipe of this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>all the male to be cast into the River</hi> a figure of <hi>killing the witneſſes)</hi> it is ſaid. <hi>And in very deed for this cauſe have I raiſed thee up; for to ſhew in thee my power, and</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:97351:127"/>
               <hi>that my name may be declared through out all the earth,</hi> Exod. 9. 16. As <hi>Pharoah</hi> at that time was raiſed up, that is <hi>aſcended out of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> that in him the Lord might fulfill his Councel and purpoſe, concerning the inlargement of his people, and thereby glorifie himſelfe, in ſhewing his great <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wiſedome,</hi> faithfulneſſe: So this <hi>Beaſt</hi> (as another <hi>Pharoah)</hi> is brought up out of the <hi>depth</hi> for the <hi>three years and an half,</hi> that in him, and by him, the Lord might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh what in his eternall councell he had determined, conteyned in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There may be ſomething in the phraſe <hi>(aſcendeth)</hi> To ſignifie.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How ſuddenly and unexpectedly this <hi>Beaſt</hi> will appeare; altogether unlookt for; yea and to ſtrang the thing will be, (eſpecially among Saints) as they would never have believ'd it, though thouſands had told them ſo much before, had they not ſeen it with their own eyes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas it is ſaid, <hi>the Beaſt aſcendeth,</hi> it is to ſhew, that he comes up of himſelf, not ſent for, nor deſired by the people; but it is his own plotting and deſignings that he takes power and Rule to himſelfe. And this I take to be an eſſentiall character
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:97351:128"/>
of this <hi>Beaſt (Aſcendeth)</hi> he will be a meat Intruder, and will ſlay the <hi>witneſſes</hi> by a power which he hath aſſumed, and uſurped, and not otherwiſe. Compare with this <hi>Dun.</hi> 7. 8. <hi>The little Horn comes up,</hi> that is, of it ſelf; he aroſe not by Election nor by Inheritance, Right, or ſuch kind of Succeſſion, but by his own craft and ſtrength. So the <hi>later Apoſtacie</hi> is ſaid <hi>to riſe</hi> or <hi>aſcend,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. Not raiſed up by the Lord.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the word, may be ſignified, the horrible pride of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> for though his deſcent be from the <hi>Depth,</hi> that is, a moſt baſe beginning, yet <hi>aſcendeth,</hi> viz. In Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Pomp, State, Court, &amp;c. As if he had not been illegitimate, but lawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. That which the Lord by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks againſt the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> I think is in part meant of this <hi>Beaſt. For thou haſt ſaid in thy heart I will aſcend into Heaven, I will exalt my throne above the ſtarrs of God, I will ſit alſo upon the Mount of the Congregation, in the ſides of the north. I will aſcend above the height of the Clouds. I will be like the moſt high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>ſcatter the</hi> holy people, weary out the Saints, and kill the witneſſes. But like the moſt high, take to himſelf the Attributes of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13. 3. That this <hi>Beaſt aſcendeth out of the depth,</hi> inmay be for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe of the great ſecrecie, and cloſeneſſe which is uſed in the forming of him.</hi> All things here muſt be done in <hi>the deep,</hi> and under ground; None (except a few, ſix or eight perſons perhaps, which model the <hi>Beaſt)</hi> muſt know any thing of it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he come forth, to the publique view of the world; Doing herein like thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom the <hi>woe</hi> is pronounced in the Prophet, <hi>That ſeek deep to hide their counſel from the Lord, and their works are in the darke, and they ſay who ſeeth us, and who knoweth us?</hi> Iſa. 29. 18.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Of the deep pollicie uſed in the framing of him.</hi> All <hi>Civil Beaſts</hi> before him, roſe either out of the <hi>Earth</hi> or <hi>Sea;</hi> but this out of the <hi>depth:</hi> ſignifying, that there was not halfe that craft and ſubtletie about them, as about this <hi>Beaſt:</hi> For there ſhall be ſo much art and workmanſhip beſtowed about him, that when he comes forth, <hi>To warr againſt the witneſſes, and to overcome them, and ſlay them,</hi> very few will perceive any ſuch thing; Not one (I ſay) of many
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:97351:129"/>
will take him for all this, to be the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> And why ſo? <hi>He aſcendeth out of the depth,</hi> from the <hi>depths of Satan;</hi> as being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed (and no marveil, for at this time he will be Satans <hi>chiefe Miniſter)</hi> into an Angel of <hi>light.</hi> So that by the place may be ſignified, He will not be taken for the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> but a <hi>great Saint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Wheras the laſt Apoſtacy is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>depth,</hi> it ſhews that there is no way to carry on a bad deſigne (for cloſeneſſe and craft) like to <hi>Apoſtacy and Hypocrifie in Religion.</hi> And by how much men riſe high in a ſhew and <hi>form of Godlineſſe</hi> (though hypocrites) the more they ſhall advantage themſelves by it. It is true, other <hi>Beaſts</hi> before him, carryed on their own Intereſt, partly by Religion, but they were ignorant and unskild of the great myſtery which this <hi>Beaſt</hi> hath learnt. For before him (note it Reader) no <hi>Civill State</hi> aſcended out of this depth of Satan, that is, from Apoſtacy in Religion; And therefore before him there was never a Government in the world raiſed up by hypocriſie in Religion, in that manner, as this will be.

forth. And howſoever it hath a mean and low beginning, yet it will riſe to a monſtrous height of Pride, againſt God and man.

And howſoever this be ſo (yea, and withall, the bleſſed Cauſe of Chriſt deſtroyed in his Witneſſes, by an uſurped power) yet this Beaſt or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall have with it, ſuch a glorious out-ſide of Religion and Form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, as among Gods own people, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them ſhall not know this State or Government to be the Beaſt which ſlays the Witneſſes, till the three years and halfe are expired.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much for the <hi>Beast,</hi> who he is, and what is ſignified by him.</p>
            <p>We come now to the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and how they are <hi>kild.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> I underſtand not <hi>perſons,</hi> but the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Teſtimony</hi> it ſelfe, which is held forth and aſſerted by them. I ſay, it is not the <hi>perſon,</hi> which the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is ſaid to kill; but the holy <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> of Chriſt, witneſſed too, and for, by the <hi>Saints</hi> of the moſt High. So that the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:97351:130"/>
perſon may live, though he be ſlaine in his Teſtimony.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> or <hi>Witneſſe,</hi> it comprehends not all <hi>Truth;</hi> For the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhall allow much <hi>Truth,</hi> and countenance men in the practice of it. Therefore the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> which he ſhall ſlay, is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken reſtrictively; that is, ſome particular Truth, which he will not indure, as proper to that <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Time.</hi> In all the dayes of the <hi>Papall Beaſt,</hi> the <hi>Sack-cloth Witneſſes</hi> might ſafely and without danger, aſſert many Goſpel-Truths; That which they ſuffered for, was for aſſerting ſuch Truths, and ſpeaking againſt ſuch Errours, and lies, as that Time would not bear, it being to the diſadvantage of the <hi>Beaſts Kingdome,</hi> that ſuch abominable filthineſſe ſhould be diſcovered. So this <hi>Beaſt</hi> will not make war againſt every Truth, but ſeeks only to deſtroy that <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> which he thinks (if not kild) will be his utter ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt. </hi>What is that<hi> Truth, </hi>or<hi> Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, </hi>here<hi> ſlaine by the Beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the <hi>laſt witneſſe</hi> which Saints ſhall hold forth, for, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of Jeſus Chriſt, againſt the Enemies of Gods people. And being the laſt of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:97351:131"/>
their Teſtimony, it can be no other then bearing <hi>witneſſe to Chriſts bleſſed and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Kingdome.</hi> That he (as heir of all things) will take all power, rule &amp; domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion into his own hands, and that all the preſent Powers and Governments of the world, ſhall be broken to pieces. And more particularly, they ſhall now bear witneſſe againſt this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> as to be that <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> by whom the <hi>witneſſes are to be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ain,</hi> and after <hi>three years and an half,</hi> his Dominion ſhall be taken from him.</p>
            <p>The obſerving of this, will lead us to the knowledg both of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Time:</hi> for it cannot be this <hi>Beaſt;</hi> unleſſe he ſlay ſuch a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> in the Saints as is here ſet down; that is, <hi>A teſtimony for Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all preſent powers, and particularly againſt the Government of this Beaſt, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring openly who he is, where his ſeat is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the Lord after three years and an halfe will utterly conſume him.</hi> And here (I think) lies the difference, between the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>Sackcloth witneſſes,</hi> before the <hi>Beaſt aſcended out of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> and afterwards. <hi>Their Teſtimony</hi> before, was mainly againſt the Idolatry of the <hi>whoriſh Church;</hi> bearing witneſſe, to the <hi>Propheticall</hi> and <hi>Prieſtly office of Chriſt;</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:97351:131"/>
and ſuffered upon that account: But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (when the <hi>three years and half be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin)</hi> their <hi>Teſtimony</hi> is (as I ſaid before) for his Reigne and Kingdome; And this <hi>witneſſe</hi> will the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſeek to murder; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that <hi>Teſtimony</hi> which was born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to his <hi>Propheticall</hi> and <hi>Prieſtly office:</hi> by which meanes the ſlaughter and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he commits, will not eaſily be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the <hi>witneſſes</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>two.</hi> I conceive it is for this reaſon. Becauſe their <hi>Teſtimony</hi> conſiſts of two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That Jeſus Chriſt ought to have his right, his honour, glory, ſervice, dominion. 2. That his enemies in not giving the ſame to him; But inſtead of exalting him, exalt themſelves, and their own intereſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall extreamlyſuffer for it; Or two, as <hi>witneſſing for righteous things, and againſt unrighteous things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the manner of their Slaying.<hi> He ſhall make war againſt them, and ſhall overcome them, and kill them,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, though the <hi>witneſſes</hi> in their <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> are ſlaine, upon the riſe of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and there we are to begin the <hi>three days and an half,</hi> yet doth he continue his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution till the whole terme be ended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:97351:132"/>
Secondly, There may be ſomething in the words <hi>(make warre, overcome, and kill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> more then hitherto hath been mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In Chap. 12. 14. The <hi>woman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to ſhun <hi>the face of the Serpent</hi> ſlyes into the <hi>wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, where ſhe is nouriſhed for a time, and times, and halfe a time. The ſlaying of the witneſſes, and that ſlight of the woman is at one time.</hi> And I think the occaſion of that flight, is this <hi>war of the Beaſt.</hi> So that he ſlays not the whole <hi>Testimony</hi> or witneſſe, but the Lord preſerves a <hi>remnant</hi> (as he did the 7000 in <hi>Iſrael)</hi> up and down the Nation, which keep the Commandments of God, and have the Teſtimony of Jeſus, all the time that the witneſſesly ſlaine.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>He ſhall make warre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt them, and ſhall overcome them.</hi> Theſe words are taken from <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>2 and have been opened before. It is true in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> there is no mention of killing; The reaſon may be, becauſe he hath reſpect to what the Horn or <hi>Beast</hi> ſhou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d doe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the perſons of the <hi>witneſſes,</hi> but ſpeaks nothing of <hi>killing,</hi> becauſe the Lord will not ſuffer him to proceed unto blood. <hi>John</hi> names killing in regard he ſhould ſlay the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony</hi> in many perſons, though not the perſon for the truths ſake.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:97351:132"/>
This likewiſe is worth the Obſerving to know the Beaſt by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how doth he ſlay the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, many wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In ſome he ſlays their Teſtimony, by preferment, and beſtowing great Offices and places upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here I may ſay (changing a few words) what is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. <hi>Woe to the Inhabiters of heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Church-Officers, and Profeſſours of Religion, for the Devill is come down unto you, having great wrath, becauſe he knoweth that the hath but a ſhort time.</hi> This <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſcornes to be ſerv'd for nought, ſpecially if they are religious, and men ſearing God; theſe rather then others, ſhall be prefer'd in his <hi>Councel, Army, Navy, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Pariſh-Tithes,</hi> ſo they will fall down and worſhip <hi>HIM</hi> and his <hi>Image.</hi> And in this deſigne he hath a double advantage. 1. He is ſure to ſlay in them, the <hi>laſt Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus;</hi> for, <hi>Noman can ſerve two Masters,</hi> He that acknowledgeth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Power of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> to be Lawfull, cannot bear a faithfull Teſtimony to the preſent Cauſe and Intereſt of Chriſt. For to have now the Teſtimony of Jeſus, is to bear a witnes againſt the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> 2. That
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:97351:133"/>
he ſlayes the <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, in many great Profeſſours, ſuch as formerly aſſerted what they now either deny or are ſilent in; By this means, the common people (ignorant of the myſtery of iniquity, working in the laſt dayes) following the others example, have their <hi>Teſtimony</hi> kil'd likewiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another way is by his hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and diſſimulation in religion. As <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaid of <hi>Goliahs ſword, there is none to that, give it me.</hi> So I think there is no weapon or crafty courſe which this <hi>Beaſt</hi> will uſe, like to his hypocriſie in the things of God; as his <hi>faſting, weeping, praying, honouring Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Sermons,</hi> &amp;c, The report and noiſe of this will ring far and neer, and by the ſimple (who believe every thing) ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, and he taken for ſuch a Saint, that now he may do what he will. For though he have all the <hi>Characters</hi> of the <hi>little Horn,</hi> and do whatſoever is foretold of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> yet his hypocriſie will cover all, and hence ſlaves the <hi>Generation Teſtimony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, When Chriſt was put to death by the Jewes, though they could prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt him, neither indeed had any thing to lay juſtly to his charge, yet they pretended great matters, and would have
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:97351:133"/>
men believe what they did in the killing of him, they had cauſe and reaſon enough for it. So will this <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſlay Jeſus Chriſt in his <hi>Teſtimony.</hi> (Hence it is ſaid, <hi>Where our Lord alſo was crucified.)</hi> Howſoever he hath nothing againſt the preſent <hi>Generation Truth,</hi> born <hi>Witneſſe</hi> to: For what can he have? Seeing nothing is Aſſerted by them, but what the Scriptures plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare; nor is he able to reſiſt the Wiſdome and the Spirit by which they ſpeak, yet will he pretend high things againſt them. As <hi>Nero</hi> when his Maſtives would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Chriſtians, clad them in Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins. So will this Beaſt doe, that his <hi>Dogs</hi> may rent and tear the <hi>Teſtimonie of Jeſus;</hi> He will cloth it, with reproachfull names, as Blaſphemy, Errour, Madneſſe, Faction, Treaſon, Sedition, &amp;c. And by this trick the ſooner effect his purpoſe. So that howſoever it be the <hi>Teſtimonie of Jeſus</hi> that he <hi>kills,</hi> yet he will kill it, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that it is the <hi>doctrine of Devills, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, the deluſion of Satan,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This Teſtimony is to be ſlain by War. <hi>He ſhall make war againſt them.</hi> Howſoever I have ſhewed my opinion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, yet the matter being conſiderable; I would have the Reader obſerve.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:97351:134"/>
1. This <hi>Beaſt</hi> (whoſoever he be) ſhall <hi>truſt in the arme of ſleſh;</hi> by this he will ſeek to ſtrengthen his <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Greatneſſe,</hi> and to reach his ends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes every way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His <hi>Army</hi> will be ſo corrupt, that whatſoever he ſhall bid them doe, againſt the <hi>Teſtimonie of Jeſus,</hi> they will doe it, right or wrong; For they will be men <hi>not having principles of honesty or conſcience.</hi> And by this meanes likewiſe, he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile very far over the Witneſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> by his Soldiers: For thoſe men (if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them) will baniſh and impriſon any of the Lords faithfull Servants, that they may not <hi>Witneſſe</hi> for Chriſt, againſt the <hi>Beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, No ſooner is <hi>this Beaſt aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> but doubtleſſe he will enact ſome Law againſt the <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Jeſus.</hi> As for Example, That it ſhall be <hi>Treaſon for men to ſpeak or act any thing againſt his Perſon; promiſe to live quietly under his Government, not call him the little Horn and Beaſt.</hi> And what is the meaning of all this? But to require all men upon pain of death, to deny Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men: For if it be the Government of the <hi>little Horne and Beaſt, in the three years</hi>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:97351:134"/>
               <hi>and halfe;</hi> Not to Witneſſe then againſt it (much more to promiſe not to Act any thing againſt it) is no other then to deny Chriſt, ſo far as concernes a <hi>Generation-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie.</hi> But howſoever this be ſo, yet the dread and terrour of ſuch an <hi>Edict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> will ſo ſeaze upon people of low and poor ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as they will chuſe rather to have the <hi>Witneſſe of Chriſt</hi> kild in them, then be perſecuted by the <hi>Beaſt</hi> for bearing any publick Witneſſe againſt him.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewed,<hi> Who the Beaſt is, and the Witneſſes, and how they are kild.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Third Point is,<hi> How it doth appear, their lying three dayes and an halfe unburied, contemporizes with the laſt Apoſtacie and the little Horn.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>And after three dayes and an halfe.]</hi>
            </q>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak the leſſe of theſe <hi>three dayes and an halfe,</hi> becauſe it is not queſtioned ſcarce by any one (neither indeed rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can it) But here is meant either the <hi>laſt three years and an halfe,</hi> which cloſe the number 1260. Or ſo much time following immediately upon it.</p>
            <p>Indeed there are ſome few, whoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is; the terme here, is the ſame with
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:97351:135"/>
the 1260 <hi>years.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is plainly againſt the Text. For the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are not ſlaine, till <hi>about the finiſhing of their Teſtimony;</hi> that is, when the 1260 <hi>years</hi> are almoſt expired.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To take <hi>dayes</hi> for <hi>years,</hi> and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to reckon ſo many <hi>years</hi> by <hi>dayes,</hi> I ſee no ground for this in Scripture, to caſt up Prophetical numbers. This Point needs no further enlargement.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> is to be in the <hi>laſt days;</hi> Now if we conſider Times and ſeaſons by their appointments and periods. No Days can be ſaid to be laſt, but the diſtinct time cloſing the 1260 <hi>years;</hi> in which Time is the <hi>little Horne</hi> and <hi>Beaſt.</hi> And therefore neceſſarily they muſt contemporize.</p>
            <p>But there are ſome other things which need Explanation.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<hi> What the Street is, in which ly the dead bodies of the Witneſſes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Where they were ſlaine, there doubtleſſe they ly. The Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as it is well obſerved by many (ſignifying a broad and ſpacious place) cannot be taken for any <hi>ſtreet</hi> within the <hi>walls of the great City.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our Lord was ſlaine in no ſtreet of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but without the gate in <hi>Golgotha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:97351:135"/>
2. Men ſeldome make war within the <hi>City walls,</hi> but in open fields.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In Cities are many Streets, but this is expreſſed in the ſingular number, neither is the word properly a <hi>ſtreet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That their <hi>dead bodies</hi> lie viſible and obvious to all <hi>Nations, kindreds, peoples,</hi> &amp;c. it muſt be without the <hi>City,</hi> and not within the <hi>walls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the <hi>great City,</hi> I underſtand here (and ſo alwayes in this Book) the Dominion and Jurisdiction of the <hi>Papal Beaſt,</hi> not onely the Eccleſiaſticall kingdome, but all Civill States and Governments under the <hi>Sea of Rome,</hi> acknowledging the <hi>Pope head of the Church.</hi> This is the <hi>Great City</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mentioned in the <hi>Revelation;</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>And the ſame houre was there a great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and the tenth part of the City fell,</hi> v. 13. Here it is not the <hi>great City,</hi> but <hi>City;</hi> which I take to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the place without the walls of the <hi>great City,</hi> where the <hi>ſlaine Witneſſes lie;</hi> that is, the power and Government of the Beaſt, by which they were kild.</p>
            <p>But to open the matter more fully. The place where the <hi>Witneſſes lie dead,</hi> is not any Kingdome, Common-wealth, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or Country, under the <hi>Authority</hi>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:97351:136"/>
               <hi>and Juriſdiction of the Pope.</hi> Neither are they <hi>ſlaine</hi> (in their <hi>Teſtimony)</hi> by any State or Government, that holds the <hi>Great Antichriſt of Rome head of the Church:</hi> For all this is within the <hi>wall,</hi> and part of the <hi>great City.</hi> So that the <hi>Witneſſes are</hi> not to be ſlain under the power <hi>of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Emperour,</hi> nor <hi>the Kings of France, Spaine, Poland, or any Catholick King, Prince, Duke, &amp;c. ſo called. But by a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and State that is off from ſubjection and Obedience to the Romiſh Beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two things (one I hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) which will give us much light to underſtand where the <hi>Witneſſes lie,</hi> and by whom they are ſlaine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By a <hi>Beaſt</hi> that ſhall not aſcend out of the <hi>Bottomleſſe Pit,</hi> till the 1260 <hi>yeares</hi> are neer expir'd. Neither, ſhall his power and dominion (being riſen) continue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>three yeares and an halfe.</hi> Hence then none of the preſent States, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world which have ſtood ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>three yeares</hi> ſhall kill them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their <hi>dead bodies</hi> lie not in any <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Country:</hi> Nor are they ſlaine in their <hi>Witneſſe,</hi> by any State ſubject to the <hi>Sea of Rome.</hi> So that whoſoever the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is, it cannot be the <hi>Emperour,</hi> nor the <hi>Duke of</hi>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:97351:136"/>
               <hi>Savoy,</hi> or ſuch like, nor in any ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; For it is but one State or Goverment that ſlayes them, neither ſhall they ly dead under more States then one. And this one not under the obedience of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> Reader, <hi>Conſider what I ſay, and the Lord give thee underſtanding in all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object.<hi> Though <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is ſo indeed, and the thing is very much to be heeded. For howſoever the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> by which the <hi>witneſſes are ſlaine,</hi> is not under the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the <hi>Romane Beaſt;</hi> yet it is FOR IT. That is, it doth more ſtrengthen and ſupport <hi>Babylon</hi> at this time, then any State or Government properly the <hi>Beaſts.</hi> For obſerve who are <hi>ſlaine,</hi> the <hi>laſt Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;</hi> that is, the <hi>Testimony of Jeſus</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till now ſo high, eminent, and full of light, and life againſt the <hi>Antichriſtian Kingdome.</hi> The <hi>Witneſſes</hi> before pluckt off but leaves and branches, theſe laid the ax to the Root, and would have the very Foundation of <hi>Babylon</hi> razed down. And now <hi>aſcendeth the Beaſt out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit,</hi> and ſlayes ſuch A WITNES as the like was never before held forth againſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:97351:137"/>
the <hi>Great Whore.</hi> So that in doing ſuch a thing, he hath done more in the behalfe of the <hi>Great City,</hi> then any State under the <hi>Beaſts dominion</hi> ever did before. For in this regard, he would not ſuffer, her abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be ript up, her <hi>baſterdly Brats</hi> to be daſh't againſt the ſtones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the blood of the martyrs found in her to be reveng'd: But ſought to <hi>cure her deadly wound.</hi> And therefore not without cauſe doth the holy Ghoſt tell us, though the <hi>place be without the great City,</hi> yet FOR IT; a friend and brother to it, and one that doth her more ſervice, then any formall member and part of it.</p>
            <p>One thing further may be meant here; Whereas the Spirit of God, tells us, that the place where the <hi>Witneſſes lie ſlaine,</hi> is <hi>without the great City,</hi> yet <hi>of it.</hi> The hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> (the GREAT CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACTER <hi>of him)</hi> is here againe notably laid open. As if he ſhould make war with one part of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (For Example, The <hi>Spaniard)</hi> pretending therein to be <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the great City,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Whore;</hi> and yet at the at the ſame time to be <hi>of it,</hi> and <hi>for it,</hi> in making Leagues and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, Offenſive and Defenſive, with others of the ſame Antichriſtian kingdome (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:97351:137"/>
               <hi>Portugall</hi> and <hi>France)</hi> and as Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and as great Enemies to Jeſus Chriſt, as that <hi>part of Babylon</hi> againſt whom he Wars.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the <hi>ſlaine Teſtimony</hi> of Chriſt, is ſet forth under <hi>dead bodies.</hi> This may be to ſignifie.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As a thing <hi>dead</hi> is ſoon forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yea men will endeavour to put away the remembrance and thoughts of it; So <hi>Apoſtates</hi> having forſaken the <hi>Truth.</hi> It is no other now then <hi>Dead,</hi> and that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences may not ſmite them for it. They fall upon new matters, not intending to bear <hi>witneſſe</hi> any more to the <hi>good old cauſe,</hi> IT'S DEAD.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Perſons <hi>dead</hi> looſe their beauty; No fairneſſe, or comelineſſe appeares in them. Though living ſweet and lovely to behold: So the <hi>Principles of Juſtice, honeſty, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> &amp;c. When once <hi>ſlaine,</hi> what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency can the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſee in them: Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, deceit, pride, oppreſſion, look better in his eye a thouſand fold.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To ſhew the cruell deſign of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> that nothing would ſatisfie his turn but the HEART BLOOD OF GODS CAUSE, the utter extirpation of it, <hi>that the name of Iſrael might be no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:97351:138"/>
4. <hi>Dead men</hi> are not fear'd: Neither doth the <hi>Beaſt</hi> now fear, the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of theſe men; for he hath by craft and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty taken ſuch a courſe: As he thinks himſelf, very ſecure, and the <hi>dead Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Child Jeſus</hi> will never<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> riſe to trouble him more.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When they put Chriſt to death, ſome mockt at him, <hi>Let him come down from the Croſſe, and we will believe him.</hi> As if he could not be the <hi>Son of God,</hi> becauſe they ſlew him. So here is meant, How the Enemies of our Lord, paſſing by the <hi>dead bodies,</hi> will ſcoff, wagging their heads, <hi>Had it been</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the Teſtimony of Jeſus, it would have ſav'd it ſelf and not been kild; but it appears now, it was onely their own Teſtimony, when they were ſo hot against Tythes, Tryers, Prieſts, Lawyers. Ha, ha!</hi> And this is one Reaſon, why the wrath of God will be ſo terrible upon the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and the Apoſtates of his Time; becauſe none before them, cauſed the holy name of God and his Truth to be ſo much blaſphemed: For in the whole Time of his Reigne, men will not ceaſe to curſe and revile the <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus;</hi> yea, the very Apoſtates themſelves, will turne Scoffers. Specially, near the Time of the <hi>Witneſſes Riſing:</hi>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:97351:138"/>
Then <hi>Apoſtate-Profeſſours,</hi> will begin to jeere and taunt indeed; when they ſee <hi>Chriſt in his Teſtimony,</hi> not onely naild on the Croſſe, but (to their thinking) gives up the Ghoſt. Now hearken, <hi>Where is your fiſt Kingdome</hi> (ſay they?) <hi>The little Horne! Your three years and a half?</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they ſpare the <hi>ſlaine Teſtimonie,</hi> in their Pulpits; But there they will break their Jeſts againſt it, to have the people laugh.</p>
            <p>But, Thirdly; It is worth enquiring, Why not onely the <hi>great City</hi> is nam'd, which ſhould be preſerved and defended by the <hi>Beaſt ſlaying the Witneſſes?</hi> But added, <hi>which ſpiritually, is called Sodome and Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, where alſo our Lord was crucified?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is great Reaſon for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To diſcover the groſſe hypocriſie of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> pretending to be againſt <hi>Babilon</hi> in all her lies and beaſtly vanities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To aggravate his wickedneſſe the more. There is little ſaid of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> as to the Characterizing of Him; beſides <hi>ſlaying the Witneſſes.</hi> The Reaſon may be, becauſe this was done before in the <hi>little Horne</hi> and <hi>laſt Apoſtacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which the Holy Ghoſt ſeems here chiefly to intend, is to unmask HIM, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:97351:139"/>
to ſet HIM forth to the life.</p>
            <p>For Example. Should he be askt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſcended out <hi>of the bottomleſſe Pit)</hi> What he comes for? What he means to doe, having taken ſo arbitrary a power to himſelfe? His anſwer will be, <q>He is for Chriſt (I really) againſt Antichriſt: For Zion againſt Babylon; as one of the ſeven Angel, I am com out (ſaith he)</q> of the (Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple note it, not the Bottomleſs Pit) <q>to poure out a Viall full of wrath upon the great Whore: and as one called, choſen and faithfull, to be with the Lamb a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ten Kings, to overcome them. And ask (ſaith he) my Chaplaines, and new made Doctors, if this be not ſo?</q>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſaith the Spirit of God? <q>O thou diſſembling H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> pocrite! Does thou War againſt my Witneſſes, overcome them and ſlay them, and yet pretend <hi>Ex parte altiſſimi letzad,</hi> On the part of the Almighty. For me, and againſt the great Whore; What an impudent face haſt thou? what a Whores forehead! Thou thoughteſt I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelfe: but I will reprove thee. Thy falſhood ſhall not ſerve the turn. For I have a way to make thee known what an hypocrite thou art, in ſpight of all thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:97351:139"/>
and the wiſe ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, though the Prophets will not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> In ſlaying ſo glorious a Teſtimony, to rouſe up thy ſelf out of the bottomles pit, In this the Saints of the moſt high ſhall clearly ſee, that thou art of the great City (not in words but actions) a main ſupporter and prop of it: Nay more, thou haſt kept her up, as ſhe is <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the vileſt of her filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and abominations, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of her cruelties, and oppreſſions: yea and more, as ſhe hath murdered me (I ſay my ſelf) in my truth, and ſervants: thus thou haſt wrapt thy ſelf in all the guilt and blood that hath been ſhed there, and which ſhall be found in her; the blood of the Prophets, and of Saints, and of all that were ſlaine upon the earth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the place gives us more light to know the <hi>Beaſt</hi> by; The Government and ſtate by which the <hi>witneſſes</hi> ſhall be ſlaine, is <hi>without the great City,</hi> not under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> in profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and words an enemy to <hi>Babylon.</hi> But in practice and works not only a bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, but a ſupporter of her, in the worſt and greateſt of her ſins, as in her whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, oppreſſions, blood of martyrs, &amp;c.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:97351:140"/>
Namely, by ſlaying the <hi>higheſt Teſtimony</hi> that ever was upon earth againſt the <hi>whole dominion of the Beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done with the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Wineſſes</hi> as to the <hi>killing-part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains that ſomething be ſpoken of the effects of it.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they of the people, and kindreds, and Tongues and Nations, ſhall ſee their dead bodies three days and an half, and ſhall not ſuffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Here we will conſider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Who theſe People are?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is meant by putting in graves?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Why they will not ſuffer the dead bodies to be put in graves?</p>
            <p n="4">4. How they keep them out?</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is ſaid that <hi>Satan ſhewd Chriſt</hi> (being upon <hi>an exceeding high mountaine) all the Kingdomes of the World,</hi> Mat. 4. 8. I doe not take it <hi>imaginary,</hi> as deceiving the ſence: but a reall ſight: Not that he ſaw <hi>all Kingdomes</hi> abſolutely, but whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were diſcernable in reſpect of the place where he ſtood: that is, all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Countryes. So here by <hi>people, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, tongues, and Nations:</hi> all are not meant under the whole Heaven; but ſuch
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:97351:140"/>
as are within the ſight of the <hi>dead bodyes,</hi> and have knowledge of their ſlaying.</p>
            <p>Againe, Neither doe all the <hi>people</hi> and <hi>kindreds,</hi> &amp;c. which ſee the <hi>dead bodies,</hi> oppoſe their buriall, but a part of them; <hi>They of the people and kindreds,</hi> &amp;c. That is, among the people and kindreds, &amp;c. there are ſome <hi>will not ſuffer,</hi> &amp;c. Now howſoever we are to underſtand the place, no further then of ſuch as know what the <hi>Beaſt</hi> hath done, (for ſo much is clearly in the Text, <hi>They ſhall ſee their dead bodies)</hi> yet the Holy Ghoſt mentions <hi>Peoples, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, tongues and nations;</hi> Becauſe this party which will not ſuffer the <hi>dead bodies to be put in graves,</hi> are not all one People. As for Example, Some may be <hi>Engliſh,</hi> others <hi>Welch,</hi> ſome <hi>Scots,</hi> others <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Dutch,</hi> &amp;c. So likewiſe of divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, Countries, Shires, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As for this Party, I take it not to be cruelty done in deſpight and diſgrace by Enemies, to deny them Buriall; But cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie of Friends and Favorers, to provide for their riſing againe. And my opinion is, here are meant.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Woman</hi> who was occaſioned by the <hi>war of this Beaſt,</hi> to fly into the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:97351:141"/>
2. The Remnant of her ſeed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe whom we named before, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths men:</hi> For howſoever theſe doe not fully cloſe with the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in the <hi>Principles of the fift Kingdom,</hi> yet they are clearly convinc'd, that the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment</hi> of this <hi>Beaſt</hi> is unlawfull, and that they ſuffer unjuſtly under him. And this <hi>Party</hi> I take to be <hi>The earth which helped the Woman, by opening her mouth, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing up the flood, which the Dragon caſt out of his mouth,</hi> Rev. 12. 16. For howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>that thing</hi> they contend for, be but an <hi>earthly Interereſt;</hi> as <hi>Lawes, Liberties, Power of the People, Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c. yet in ſtanding for ſuch things, they give the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſuch a Check, as Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger all his venome and wrath, he cannot devour the woman ſtanding for the <hi>dead witneſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, For the ſecond Point. By <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in graves;</hi> I underſtand an extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Testimony of Jeſus.</hi> That is, Chriſts viſible Kingdome, to be no more aſſerted: the corrupt powers of the world left alone, ſo the Apoſtates and hypocrites in the laſt dayes, not ſo much as nam'd: briefly for the <hi>little Horn and Beaſt,</hi> no more to be ſpoken againſt, But all for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:97351:141"/>
ſake be ſubject to his Luſt and Will. Thus indeed the <hi>Beaſt</hi> would have the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> buried, but he is not ſuffered: They remaine above ground in ſpight of him; that is, kept up for a glorious reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Knowing the <hi>Parties,</hi> we may the more eaſily gueſſe at the Cauſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the <hi>Woman</hi> and her <hi>ſeed</hi> are deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd in the <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> ſo they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour what they can to maintaine it; And the rather, becauſe they know what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever deſigne the Enemie hath againſt it, to bury it, he ſhall not, let him doe his worſt. As when <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Arch-Angel,</hi> contending with the <hi>Devil</hi> about the body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Angel prevailed. So in this Controverſie about the <hi>dead Witneſſes,</hi> the <hi>Woman</hi> and her <hi>ſeed</hi> will certainly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; which is comfort and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They will not ſuffer it,</hi> becauſe of their zeal and affection to the <hi>Testimony of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> Though <hi>David</hi> a long time was <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred among the Dead,</hi> by reaſon of <hi>Sauls</hi> bloody perſecution, yet alwaye; he had ſome friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k faſt to his Int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reſt. It is true, there may ſeem to be <hi>a death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cauſe of Chriſt</hi> during the <hi>Beaſts</hi>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:97351:142"/>
reigne, but it ſhall not want friends to keep it from the <hi>Grave;</hi> The love of God will conſtraine them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Beaſt</hi> in ſlaying the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> will ſhew ſo much hypocriſie, falſhood, lying, Tyranny, &amp;c. As will occaſion <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Tongues, and Nations,</hi> &amp;c. conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually (ſometimes in one place, otherwhile in another) to appear againſt him, and plead the Cauſe of the poor and needy; In ſo much, as he will not know what to doe. Nor how to proceed any further; to wit, (having <hi>ſlaine</hi> them) to put them in <hi>Graves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus</hi> being <hi>ſlaine;</hi> that is, comparatively now dead, to what ſpirit and life it had. (For it ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its feet before, and had Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with it, till the <hi>Beaſt</hi> came up.) Notwithſtanding all this, (I ſay) though <hi>Dead,</hi> in reſpect of Spirit, Life, Power, Authority; yet ſhall not the <hi>Beaſt</hi> be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to extinguiſh it altogether, in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where he hath ſlaine it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe if he ſhould ſo far prevaile, it would not onely ſtrengthen the preſent <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> but open a gap of <hi>Athieſm</hi> to many others: For as the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in ſlaying the <hi>laſt Witneſſe</hi> makes many <hi>Hypocrites,</hi>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:97351:142"/>
ſo ſhould he bury it, he would make as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Atheiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Should he be ſuffered, he would doe more wickedly then he doth; For in that he cannot <hi>bury Chriſts Teſtimony,</hi> he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from acting the miſchiefes, which otherwiſe he would.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is not ſuffered. Becauſe this <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> (though comparatively dead to what life it had) ſhall be his ruine, when the <hi>three years and halfe are expir'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, For the laſt point, <hi>How they keep them out?</hi> To open this it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred; It is the <hi>Witneſſe of Chriſt I take to be ſlaine.</hi> Not ſuffered to be put <hi>in Graves;</hi> becauſe ſome ſhall plead for it, defend it, and hold it forth, all the time of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> rage and Tyranny. So that in one reſpect it is <hi>kild,</hi> in another <hi>alive;</hi> For ſome ſhall ſtill appear for that <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> which in others the Beaſt hath ſlaine. In the days of <hi>Elias,</hi> when they had thrown down the Lords Altars, and ſlaine his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets with the ſword, yea and the Prophet himſelfe forc't to fly for his life: here it might well be ſaid, that the <hi>Lords witneſſe was ſlaine,</hi> yet <hi>not put in grave.</hi> For at the ſame time. <hi>The Lord had</hi> 7000 <hi>which had not bowed the knee unto Baal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:97351:143"/>
And this I take to be the meaning here. <q>The prevailing power of the Beaſt ſhall be ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he will ſlay the viſible Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus, held forth in ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick manner before his riſing; yet he ſhall not be ſuffered to put it in grave: For God will have ſome thouſands ſtill, which ſhall not bowe the knee to the Beaſt; but own and honour the truth n urdered by him, all his Reigne.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much for the firſt Party. The other ſort followes.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they that dwell upon the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>: ſhall rejoyce over them, and make merry, and ſhall ſend guiſts one to another, becauſe theſe two Prophets tormented them that dwelt on the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>To theſe is given a ſpeciall Character, <hi>Dwell on the Earth.</hi> The ſubject of the <hi>firſt Vial is Earth,</hi> Rev. 16. 2. and the ſame mentioned here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>latter Apoſtacy,</hi> whoſe deſcription we had before from 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. The Cauſe of their joy, is the great advantage which they have by the death of the <hi>Teſtimony.</hi> For no ſort of men ſhall outwardly thrive and proſper under the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> like <hi>Apoſtates;</hi> It being a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or State erected by them, and for
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:97351:143"/>
their owne Intereſt alone.</p>
            <p>Another good Note to know the reigne of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> by, <hi>viz.</hi> WHEN APO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STATES FLOURISH. It cannot be his time, if it be not Apoſtates time; if car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Profeſſors doe not hold up their heads, look big, and domineere: and he that will like <hi>Judas,</hi> get the bag, muſt get himſelfe into ſome Church. For as in Chriſts time buying and ſelling was in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and there were the <hi>Money changers.</hi> So under this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> places, offices, and preferment, will be crept into the Church: In ſo much as no conſiderable preferment will be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, unleſſe the perſon be <hi>a Church-member,</hi> or can procure ſome <hi>Church-mans</hi> hand for it. Thus we ſee who they are, that will rejoyce at this time, and make merry, and ſend guifts one to another.

            <p>It is ſaid, <hi>Becauſe the two Prophets tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented them.</hi> But wherein? Becauſe they ſpake againſt all unrighteouſneſſe of men; Preſſed men to keep their Promiſes and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements:
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:97351:144"/>
Declared openly againſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, lying, and hypocriſie; would have <hi>Babylon</hi> down, with all her will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and inventions; People to have their power, freedome, and liberty, according to Reaſon and Conſcience, and none to have any Arbitrary Government fore't upon them. But ſuch a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> as this could not be borne, it was worſe then an <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an boile;</hi> Inſomuch, as they had no peace, or reſt, till they had ſlaine that which ſo <hi>tormented them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This place puts me in mind of what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the Diſſolution of the<hi> little Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: </hi>The Joy then among the<hi> Prieſts </hi>and<hi> formall Profeſſours, </hi>was much like that of the<hi> Philiſtines, </hi>when they had<hi> Sampſon </hi>in their hands.<hi> Then the Lords of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims gathered them together, for to Offer a great Sacrifice unto Dagon their God, and to rejoyce; for they ſaid, Our God hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Sampſon our Enemy, into our hand. And when the People ſaw him, they praiſed their God; for they ſaid, Our God hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into our hands, our Enemy, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of our Country, which ſlew many of us. And it came to paſſe when their hearts were merry, that they ſaid, call for Sampſon, that he may make us ſport, </hi>Judg. 16. 23, 24, 25.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:97351:144"/>
Some of them, more Religious (ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly at leaſt) were for <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Hence Dayes were kept of Thankſgiving (as they call it.) And now the <hi>Trumpets ſound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,</hi> Oh what the Lord hath done for the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Levi,</hi> the <hi>holy Miniſtery,</hi> and <hi>Maintenance;</hi> The <hi>Enemy</hi> and <hi>Deſtroyer of their Country,</hi> had likely to have put out all the lights of the Tabernacle. One of them I remember told the people, <q>The National Clergy, was like good <hi>Iſaac,</hi> bound and ready to have been Sacrificed. And that God by a wonderfull delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance had preſerv'd them, when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-Knife was at the throat of their ſacred Calling, Tythes, and the like.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For the other ſort, what they did, I need not mention: But <hi>when their hearts were merry,</hi> Then <hi>Sampſon</hi> is cal'd for. And what is now the Subject of all their ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Talk and Jeſts, but the <hi>ſhort liv'd Parliament:</hi> Oh this cruell <hi>Sampſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that had it in his heart, not onely to have brought <hi>their Craft in danger to be ſet at nought, but the Temple of the great Goddeſſe Diana.</hi> And to ſay the truth, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were not much miſtaken in it: For pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it is, had not that glorious <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus been kild,</hi> They would have ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Tayle of the Beaſt,</hi> after the <hi>Head;</hi> Swept away that other part of <hi>Popiſh dung and traſh,</hi> which the former Parliament had left in the Nation. Now if the Holy Ghoſt meant not theſe men, and their <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king merry;</hi> yet I am ſure, it was fulfilled in them, according to the letter of the Text.</p>
            <p>One part of the Propheſie yet remaines, and it is the better part; Namely, <hi>The riſing of the Witneſſes.</hi> And here we have the Time, the Means, and the Manner, with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies amazement at it, and the like.</p>

take his Dominion from him, untill it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, that the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are Riſen, the Spirit poured forth, the Beaſt certainly known; and the Lord appearing in ſome viſible providence, making the way plaine for the Angel of the firſt <hi>

            <p>Secondly, By <hi>the Spirit of life from God,</hi> &amp;c. I underſtand and the <hi>ſending of the Comforter,</hi> that great promiſe of the Father to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with power from on high, <hi>Lak</hi> 24. 49. As herbes, flowers, and graſſe, ſeem dead and hang the head, by reaſon of drought; but riſe againe flouriſh, and grow green, when raine falls thereon. So the <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> which ſeemed withered, and ſcorch't, hath now from the Lord life and Spirit put into it, and ſo that <hi>Death</hi> is taken off which lay formerly on it.</p>
            <p>And this I take to be the Time in which Saints may expect the returne of their prayers, concerning the pouring out of the Spirit, and the fullfilling of ſuch Promiſes.<hi> In the wilderneſſe ſhall waters break out, and ſtreames in the deſert, </hi>Iſa. 35. 6.<hi> I will pour waters upon him that is thirſty, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Howſoever before the <hi>riſing of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> there will be ſome ſprinkling of the Spirit, here and there. For the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Time: As a man knows by the dawning that the night is paſt: yet I think till the <hi>witneſſes are riſen:</hi> the Saints ſhall not be endued with power from on high, neither Generally, nor largely.

            <p>Thirdly, No ſooner doth <hi>a Spirit of life from God enter into them.</hi> But <hi>they ſtand upon their feet:</hi> By which manner of ſpeaking (according to the Scripture) is ſignified.</p>

               <q>None of the men of might have found their hands, the ſtout hearted are ſpoiled.

My opinion is, God will ſend ſuch a faintneſſe into the hearts of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſtrike them with ſuch a horrour and dread, that the ſound of a leafe ſhall chaſe them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſhall fly and none purſue them.

But much more now, being aſcended, and gotten above them, to pour out a vial full of the wrath of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads.

Behold the People ſhall riſe up as a great Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and lift up himſelfe as a young Lyon, he ſhall not lie down untill he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the ſlaine.

be amazed one at another, their faces ſhall be as flames, </hi>Iſa. 13. 7, 8. But when ſhall this be? At this time, I ſay now, the Lord having called his<hi> Mighty ones, and his ſanctified ones, and muſtered the hoſt of the battell agaixſt Babylon, </hi>v. 1, 2, 3, 4. And this is one Reaſon why I doe conceive, For material weapons the Saints have no need to make much proviſion before hand. Though<hi> Joſhua </hi>took<hi> All the People of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour; Yet there died more with hailſtones, then they whom the children of Iſrael ſlew with the ſword, </hi>Joſh. 107, 11.

            <p>And here I deſire the diſcreet Reader to obſerve the Method and order which the Lord (as it ſeemes to me) will follow in making Chriſts enemies his footſtool. When the <hi>three yeares and an halfe</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd (for till then the appointed time will not come for him to ariſe and have mercy upon <hi>Zion)</hi> there will be a pouring out of the Spirit in abundance, whereby the hearts of the faithfull every where will be raiſed up to high and great reſolutions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>later Apoſtacie, the little Horn</hi>

            <head type="sub">
               <hi>Ye Precious Ones, and Saints of the moſt High.</hi> It is not much that I ſhall add; But it is to give <hi>YOU</hi> an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Occaſion of this <hi>Work.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>UPON my Baniſhment from <hi>Hull</hi> (for what Cauſe I know not, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this day made known to me.) I went a part (as <hi>Elias</hi> did) into the <hi>Wilderneſſe.</hi> And as I lay under hedges, &amp; in holes, my Soul in bitterneſſe breathed forth many ſad complaints before the Lord. <hi>It is enough O Lord take away my life, for I am not better then my Fathers.</hi> Often and ſore wreſtlings
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:97351:154"/>
I had with my God, to know His <hi>Meaning</hi> and <hi>Teaching,</hi> under this Diſpenſation; And what further work (whether <hi>Doing</hi> or <hi>Suffering)</hi> he had for me, his <hi>Poor old Sevant,</hi> being now againe Baniſhed, after 17 <hi>years Baniſhment before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being brought thus <hi>at the feet of God;</hi> and there waiting and Hearkning <hi>What the Lord would ſpeak.</hi> I had the <hi>Former Things</hi> (for the Subſtance of them) given in unto me. And I can ſpeak it in Truth: I underſtood them not till now; But thought <hi>The Time of the End,</hi> was to be found out and known ſome other way.</p>
            <p>Now howſoever I could not but think, there was <hi>Something of God in This;</hi> As to <hi>an Anſwer of Prayer.</hi> (Eſpecially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving theſe Things upon my heart as I was pouring out my ſoule <hi>at the Throne of grace.)</hi> Nevertheleſſe, Conſidering, the weightineſſe and difficulty of the <hi>Matter.</hi> How differing it was, to what Others Held; And how deeply Some (and my ſelfe alſo) have ſuffered for <hi>our Miſtakes,</hi> in medling with ſuch <hi>High Things:</hi> But chiefly, what a poor worth-leſſe and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thing I was, <hi>More brutiſh then any man,</hi> and had not the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand of a man;</hi> And how ſubtilly <hi>Satan</hi> worketh at this
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:97351:154"/>
Time in Some, by a <hi>ſpirit of deluſion,</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to high things, and that it is God that ſpeaketh in them. Upon theſe and ſuch like Conſiderations, my Soule was ſore diſtreſſed, and I beſought the Lord with Tears Day and Night, that he would take Pitty on Me, and not leave me to <hi>a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as often as I ſet my face unto the Lord, by prayer and ſupplication, I found my ſelfe more Encouraged, and had more of the Propheſies opened unto me. Yea (and the Lord knows I lie not) whenſoever my heart hath been moſt melted and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before him, and my ſoule ſwallowed up with the greateſt Love and Longing after his Glory; AT SUCH TIMES I have been moſt confirmed, and ſtrengthned, to believe, that it was <hi>the Spirit of truth</hi> which revealed theſe things to me, <hi>a Worm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe, being yet unſatisfied in my ſelfe (as Fearfull leaſt I ſhould go aſide from the <hi>Teachings of God.)</hi> I acquainted ſome of ſome of my <hi>Chriſtian Friends</hi> with the Thing, and how the Caſe ſtood with me; and deſired that the <hi>ſame</hi> might be Spread before the Lord: The which was done ſeverall Times; And very earneſtly was the Lord ſought unto, for Counſell
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:97351:155"/>
and Direction, that there might be no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage on either Hand. Much I could ſay concerning this Particular; But I ſhall ſay no more then this, I found the Fruit of their Prayers, <hi>A Greater Confirmation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all this (for I was not quiet yet) having put things into ſome Order, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated my Thoughts unto other Friends: Some of theſe (whoſe Works praiſe them in the Gate) I found to be of my Opinion; For which <hi>I thanked God and took courage.</hi> As did <hi>Paul</hi> when the Brethren met him, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 15. But O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (and Pretious Ones too) were (as I apprehended) otherwiſe minded. And here began, as the laſt, ſo my ſoreſt and ſharpeſt Conflict.</p>
            <p>For ſo much was I diſcouraged now, as I had <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> Complaint often up. <hi>O Lord thou haſt deceived me, and I was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; Thou art ſtronger then I, and haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,</hi> Jer. 20. 7. I muſt confeſſe the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations</hi> before named (eſpecially being conſcious to my own Emptineſſe and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty) hath ſo much affected me. That I have been more ready (except in Prayer) to fall in with any <hi>outward Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and to improve them, whenſoever they came; Then to cloſe with <hi>inward</hi>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:97351:155"/>
               <hi>Ecouragements,</hi> even the <hi>Stirring and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> (I think I may ſay) <hi>the Viſions of God,</hi> which I have powerfully felt upon my ſoule, when I have been neareſt the <hi>Mercy Seat.</hi> But <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> praiſed be the Lord, who hath taken from <hi>Me</hi> (a worm ſtill) theſe <hi>Diſcouragements</hi> and <hi>Fears,</hi> by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up my heart into joy of Believing.</p>
            <p>It may be in Reading of this, you would willingly know my <hi>Intention?</hi> It is Thus: I have not Publiſhed this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> as I have done things heretofore; For in Humility, &amp; an awful fear of my God, Here I can ſay and that truly, THIS IS A WORK OF FAITH AND PRAYER, Not of my own Labor and ſtudy (comparitively) as former Things have been; For here I have been more <hi>out of the Body,</hi> and with the Lord on the Mount. But oh I would be humble in ſuch Expreſtions, that THE LORD ALONE MIGHT BE EXALTED. And I a remaine ſtill a Worme in my hole, and numbred among the dead.</p>
            <p>Neither have I reſted in the <hi>Experiences of Gods inward Workings</hi> upon my ſoule, that is, To his giving forth of the Spirit alone. But the Holy Scriptures have been <hi>The Men of my Counſell,</hi> Pſal. 119. 24. Inſomuch as I have not hearkned any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:97351:156"/>
to the <hi>Perſwaſions</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> Though received as the <hi>Finger of God.</hi> Then what I might doe (yea and ought) by the <hi>Covenant-Promiſe,</hi> I ſay by Faith Grounded upon the bleſſed Word.</p>
            <p>Such Scriptures, through the <hi>Free Grace of a divine Bleſſing,</hi> by a humble Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Intereſt of them, have ſweetly ſupported me. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 9. &amp; 33. 3. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 4. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 20, 21. &amp; 2. 18, 19, 23. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 12, 13. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 17. &amp; 25 9. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 13, 14. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 4, 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 8, 9. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 14, 15. Hence I ſaw clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>with Supplications the Lord hath led his people.</hi> And whilſt they have been Mourning, and by the Spirit making Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for them, with Groanings which cannot be uttered; For <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from the holy One, and to be guided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into all Truth.</hi> The Lord hath mercifully appeared to them. Neither have ſuch <hi>humble and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearted Babes,</hi> met with the <hi>Portion</hi> of <hi>Proud Phariſes,</hi> viz. <hi>Diſappointment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All fleſh is graſſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the Word of the Lord endureth for ever, </hi>1 Pet. 1. 24, 25.<hi> It is a ſure word, </hi>2 Pet. 1. 19.<hi> Believe in the Lord, ſo ſhall ye be eſtabliſhed: Believe

his Prophets, ſo ſhall ye proſper, </hi>2 Chron. 20. 20.</p>
            <p>But howſoever in the Publiſhing of theſe things, I ſeem to declare a <hi>Humble Boldneſſe</hi> in my God, as to the truth of them. Yet this I deſire the <hi>Kingdome-Saints</hi> every where to mind; That as <hi>the three yeares and a halfe</hi> (of which we have ſpoken) are to have their <hi>Period:</hi> So muſt all things following (in order to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>little Horn)</hi> be likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. It is true, the <hi>latter Apoſtacy, the little Horn, and the Beaſt that ſlayes the Witneſſes,</hi> have but <hi>three years and an half:</hi> Yet it muſt not be underſtood, as if at the End of that time, they ſhould preſently be deſtroyed. But when that Time is expired, then <hi>the Judgement ſhall ſit.</hi> The <hi>Witneſſe riſe;</hi> And ſo all the reſt of the Propheſies (concerning them) be fulfild, in due Order and Time.</p>
            <p>This I thought good to mention againe, to prevent <hi>miſtakes:</hi> For ſuppoſe the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Time ſhould End about <hi>June</hi> 57. That which next followes will be no more (as I take it) But <hi>the pouring out of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the riſing of the Witneſſes;</hi> Whereby <hi>the Saints of the moſt High,</hi> ſhall be raiſed up, in <hi>Faith, Light, Love, Zeal, One-neſs,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:97351:157"/>
and ſo <hi>made meet for the Maſters uſe.</hi> But among the <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> Dread, Fear, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Diviſions, Diſappointment, &amp;c. Onely the Lords Work (the <hi>appointed time</hi> being come) will goe foreward, riſe, and alwayes Proſper: Untill <hi>Jehovah</hi> have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fild his whole Counſell upon the <hi>latter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy,</hi> the <hi>little Horn, and Beaſt which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth out of the Depth.</hi>

            <p>Hence it is (through the miſtake of this) that ſtrange conceits have been taken up, to wit, that in theſe <hi>Three years and an halfe,</hi> great Battles would be fought infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite blood ſhed, a generall perſecution of the Saints, by banniſhment, impriſonment, burning, hanging, drowning, &amp;c. And horrible commotions, and hurliburlies the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:97351:158"/>
world over. Whereas to me (humbly be it ſpoken) I ſee no ſuch thing intended by the Holy Ghoſt; No <hi>Civill War,</hi> nor <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill killing</hi> intimated. But as the <hi>Thing ſlaine,</hi> is <hi>Spiritual;</hi> namely, <hi>The Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus.</hi> So this <hi>War</hi> and <hi>killing</hi> is to be taken, Not Civilly, but in a Spiritual ſence. I ſay, it is the <hi>Truth</hi> that ſuffers, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then perſons for it. And in this regard the <hi>Beaſt</hi> will <hi>ſlay the Witneſſe</hi> without any great Noiſe or Notice.</p>
            <p>This alſo may ſerve to remove another <hi>ſtone</hi> out of ſome mens way; Occaſioned, through our ſtreightning Things to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Country</hi> or <hi>Iſle.</hi> As if the <hi>laſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, the Little Horn, and the Beaſt which ſlayes the Witneſſes,</hi> ſhould be applyed more General and Large, then we do.</p>
            <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>The kingdome of God will not come with Obſervation.</hi> I wiſh that this might be Remembred. As the day breaks firſt but in one part of the skie; though the Light from thence, ſwiftly ſpreads it ſelfe all over. So will the work of the Lord, after the <hi>Three yeares and halfe</hi> are expir'd, begin (not every where) but in one Country, and from them proceed, from one place to another, untill <hi>all Chriſts E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies be made his foot ſtool.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:97351:158"/>
2. I am groundedly convinc't that the work ſhall begin upon the <hi>laſt Apoſtacie the little Horn and Beaſt.</hi> But by theſe not the <hi>Germane Emperour the Duke of Savoy,</hi> nor any <hi>Popiſh Power or dominion</hi> can be meant. For my part I doe not apprehend, that there is any probable ground ſo to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it: And therefore if theſe men would but ſoberly, and impartially weigh things themſelves (laying aſide what others have held) they would ſee the <hi>Apoſtacy, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Horn, and the Beaſt ſlaying the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in one Country, and that ONE not within the walls of <hi>Babylon,</hi> But without, at leaſt I think ſo.</p>
