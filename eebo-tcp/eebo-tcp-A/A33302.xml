            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Low-Countries</hi> are seated very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously for all the Provinces of <hi>Europe.</hi> For North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it is but 5 or 6 dayes journey by Sea from <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</hi> Southward it consineth with <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Lorrain.</hi> Eastward with <hi>Almain,</hi> or <hi>Germany.</hi> Westward with <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> It's also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for <hi>Norway,</hi> and <hi>Sweden:</hi> for a Ship went from <hi>Holland</hi> to <hi>Norway</hi> in 46 houres. From <hi>Lisbon</hi> its scarce 10 dayes Voyage.</p>
            <p>The circuit of the Country is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43370:6"/>
about a Thousand <hi>Italian</hi> Miles, or 34 <hi>Flemish</hi> Leagues. In that part of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> that formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> are contained 208 walled Towns: An hundred and fifty Towns priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as walled Towns: Six thousand three hundred Villages with Parish Churches, besides a great number of other Villages, and Hamlets.</p>
            <p>The Beeves of <hi>Frisland</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are very great, and weigh some of them sixteen hundred pounds. Yea, one there was presented to the Earl of <hi>Hockstrait</hi> which weighed two thousand five hundred twenty eight pounds of the Country weight.</p>
            <p>The Ewes in <hi>Holland, Frisland,</hi> and part of <hi>Flanders</hi> bring forth 3 or 4 Lambs at a time, and the Kine often two Calves. The Country brings forth much Mather, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a great part of <hi>Europe</hi> is furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed? Wood, and Hemp, and Flaxin great abundance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43370:6"/>Five principal Rivers are in these Countries: The <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Meuse,</hi> the <hi>Scheld, Haa,</hi> and <hi>Emms,</hi> besides divers smaller. The <hi>Muse</hi> affords abundance of Sturgeons, so big, that some of them weigh 400, and some 420 pounds, and are 12 Foot long of <hi>Antwerp</hi> measure.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Muse</hi> yeildeth also great store of Salmons, and Salmon Trouts, Lamprayes, Shads, Congers, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and divers other sorts of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, which coming into fresh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, become fat, and excellent good.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scheld,</hi> by reason of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity it hath with the mouth of the <hi>Meuse,</hi> hath divers sorts of Fishes that come out of the Sea, as Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, Salmons, Salmon Trouts, Lamprayes, Turbots, Congers, Shads, Mullets, Soles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> besides which, such an infinite number of frie come out of the Sea, and are taken in this River, that multitudes of People are relieved therewith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:43370:7"/>Besides these Rivers, divers Channels are cut out, and made na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable by mans hand, the principal whereof are at <hi>Bruxells, Gant, Bruges,</hi> and <hi>Middlebourg.</hi> The Country hath not many Fountains of running wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, save in the mountainous part: But Lakes, Pools, and Marshes many, which both fortify the Country, and furnish it with Fish.</p>
            <p>The Sea ariseth at <hi>Calais</hi> in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> 18 Foot: but where its pressed into a Straight, as at <hi>Bristow,</hi> it rises 66 Foot: At St <hi>Malo,</hi> and <hi>Mount</hi> St. <hi>Michael</hi> in <hi>Normandy</hi> 80 Foot. The depth of the Sea between <hi>Calais</hi> and <hi>Dover</hi> is 24 Fathom (every fathom 6 foot) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> 23. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Wight,</hi> and <hi>Normandy</hi> 28. Near to <hi>Sylly</hi> 60: and so the nearer the Main the deeper.</p>
            <p>Herrings come out of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Seas in incredible multitudes into our Seas in <hi>August, September,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43370:7"/>
and mid <hi>November:</hi> But the best are taken from mid-<hi>September,</hi> 'till the end of <hi>October.</hi> The sooner the cold begins, the sooner they come, and in the greater number. They once compass our Isle of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and so pass into the Northern Ocean. Their course is hard by the Shore, and they swim gazing where they see any Light, Fire, or humane Creatures.</p>
            <p>They have Kings among them, as Bees have, marked on the Head like a Crown, and are somewhat ruddy, especially upon the Head. The Kings goe before them, and they are followed with an infinite number, which in the Night afar off seem like Lightning, by reason that their eyes are bright like fire. They feed upon water only, and dye as soon as they are taken out.</p>
            <p>Many Cods are taken in the same Months with the Herrings; and some of them are above 50 pound weight.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43370:8"/>
Of these two kinds of Fishes they yearly make vast summs. Salmons are taken at all times of the year in <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Zealand.</hi> These 3 kinds of Fish, yeild yearly to them (the Salt deducted) six hundred thousand pound Sterling.</p>
            <p>They have divers Forrests, and Woods, well stored with Red and Fallow Deer, Goats, Wild Boars, Hares, Conies, Badgers, Wolves, Foxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whcth yeild good Furrs.</p>
            <p>The Fowl in this Country are Partridge, Feasants, Turtle Doves, Quails, Black-birds, and in briefe, all kinds of Fowl, and Birds that be in <hi>England,</hi> both Water, and Land Fowl, especially water Fowl in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The People are valiant, and very skilful Seamen: their Hoyes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good to brook the Seas, by reason whereof they dispatch their Voyages sooner than other Nations. They are good Linguists, and very skilful in Merchandise. They excel
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43370:8"/>
in making Woollen cloth, Tapestry, Fustians, Silks, Velvets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Art of Painting, and the making of Woollen, and Linnen Cloth, and of Dying.</p>
            <p>The Women govern all, both within doors, and without, and make all bargains, which makes them too too injurious and troublesom. The eldest Daughter is of the greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, yet hath no larger a Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than the rest. They marry Noble with ignoble, young with old, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and Servant, into strange Towns, and Forrain Countries.</p>
            <p>There are 17 Provinces, <hi>Brabant, Lemburg, Luxenburg, Guilders,</hi> which are Dutchies; <hi>Flanders, Artois, Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalt, Holland, Zealand, Namur,</hi> and <hi>Zutphen,</hi> which are Earldoms; The <hi>Marquisat</hi> of the sacred Empire, <hi>Frisland, Malines, Utrecht, Over-Issel,</hi> and <hi>Groningham,</hi> which are Senio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. <hi>Lothier</hi> is a bare Title, for the Land remaineth in <hi>Lorrain.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Holland</hi> is as much to say, a <hi>hollow Land,</hi> because the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it stands upon the Water; so that if you go, or ride, the ground will tremble under you. Its boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded North and West with the <hi>Sea:</hi> South with the <hi>Meuse,</hi> and <hi>Brabant:</hi> East with the <hi>Zuiderzee,</hi> and <hi>Guelder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Through it run many armes of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and <hi>Meuse,</hi> besides a number of Channels made by Art, almost between every Village of moment.</p>
               <p>It hath in it a number of Islands made by the Sea, the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the <hi>Meuse,</hi> of divers Names, yet all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the name of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The ground is so low that they are fain to Fence it, with Dikes, and Rampers, as well against the Sea, as against almost all the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Channels into which the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43370:21"/>
Sea Ebbs and Flows; so that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places you shall see the Sea above the Land, yet kept back by these Banks.</p>
               <p>This Country hath few Trees in it, because the ground is so spungy, that it is not able to bear the weight of a Tree; and yet lesse quantity of Fruit and Grain grows in it for the same reason. Yet have they such plenty of Grain from the <hi>Easterlings,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> as is not only suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for their own use, but liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to impart to other Countries. And they have such plenty of <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Wine from <hi>Germany</hi> that they spend more than in the Country where it grows. Flax they have none growing, and yet make more Linnen Cloth than any Country in the World. Wool also they have none of their own, and yet make an infinite number of Cloths.

               <p>Their principal home-commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties consists in breeding of Horses, the Kine in their fat Pastures, and Meddows, and Turfe, whereof they sell an infinite quantity to other Countries. The Butter and Cheese made in a year in <hi>Holland</hi> amounts to above a Million of Crowns. But their greatest commodity comes by Fishing, and Navigation.</p>

               <p>Both these Provinces lye on the North and West side of <hi>Flanders.</hi> In <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the <hi>Meuse;</hi> and in <hi>Zealand,</hi> the <hi>Scheld,</hi> fall into the Sea, in such larg Channels, as loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the condition of Rivers, they seem to carry new Seas into the Sea. On the contrary, the Ocean first washing the said two Provinces
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43370:22"/>
for a long tract of ground, and turning then (as it were) from a Sea to a River, it penetrates into each of them by divers Channels, and hides it self there in sundry <hi>Gulphs.</hi> From hence, joyning with the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and together with them cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Zealand</hi> thorough in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it makes thereof many Islands, and reduces <hi>Holland</hi> into a <hi>Peninsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</hi> And together with these three aforenamed Rivers, which are the chiefest of all <hi>Flanders,</hi> there are in <hi>Holland</hi> divers other lesser ones: And, as if Art would contend with Nature, there are added thereunto an infinite number of Channels cut out by mans hand, which are made for the greater accommodation of the Country.</p>
               <p>There are within <hi>Holland</hi> also a great number of Lakes, and standing waters; so as the situation of both these Provinces being well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it is to be questioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43370:22"/>
the space of ground be greater which by the water is won from the Earth, or from the Water by the Earth. Nor is it less disputable, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Country do more abound with, or be more wanting of those commodities which men enjoy in other places. For through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their situation they want both Corn, Wine, Oyle, Wool, Wood, Hemp, Flax, and almost all other commodities and delights which are used in more temperate and dry Climates: And yet again, there is no Country, not only in the Northern nook, even not in any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> which abounds so much as <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the forenamed commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yea, even of those which are less necessary for the maintenance of humane life: So great is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which these two Provinces receive by the Sea, and Rivers, whereby their commerce with all
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43370:23"/>
other Countries is made so easie, which since they have introduced, and made so familiar in both the <hi>Indies,</hi> it cannot be said how much both Merchandizes, and Merchants are increased in both of them.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that they abound so much with People, and that their Cities, Towns, and Villages are so well inhabited. Yet the Sea like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is as full of Ships, and other Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and all their watry places with other sorts of Boats, which all of them serve for habitations, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to Mariners, and Fishers. Great is the number of People that apply themselves to these two Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itons in <hi>Holland,</hi> and in <hi>Zealand.</hi> They make houses of their Ships, and of their Houses Schools: Here they are born: Here they are bred up: and here they learn their Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And the Marriners especially, who practising their Callings, in running so oft, and so boldly from
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43370:23"/>
the one Pole to the other, and wheresoever the Sun communicates it self to Mortals, grow so expert therein, as though they may be equalled, yet they cannot be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done in this Seafairing Mystery, by any Nation whatsoever. In briefe, these People are generally given to Traffique, and are extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious in Manual, and Mechanical Arts.</p>
               <p>Their greatest delight lyes in their meat, and in their Feasts, by which they temper the melancholly of their tedious Winters, which are rather long than sharp, the Country abounding much more in Rain than in Frosts. They are generally well shaped in Body; and as candid in nature as in countenance: Pleasant in their leasure times; but fierce in their Warrs, and much better in fighting at Sea than by Land: they feed most upon Fish, and are Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, wherein their Country doth
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43370:24"/>
infinitely abound. They have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been inclined to a free Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and have ever tenaciously held their ancient Customs.</p>

                  <hi>Holland</hi> is full of Great Cities, good Towns, and infinite in Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But by reason of the frequency of Forreigners, and multitudes of Natives, <hi>Amsterdam</hi> hath alwayes been the chiefest City of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. Even whilst commerce flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> great was the concourse of Forreigners to <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> But Commerce failing in that City, by reason of the Warrs with <hi>Spain,</hi> it is so mightily encreased in this other, as <hi>Amsterdam</hi> is at this houre the place of greatest Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing, not only in <hi>Holland,</hi> but in all the North.

Its almost impossible to

enter either of these Provinces by force: Becaus not only the chief places but even the commonest Towns are environed, either by the Sea, Rivers, Lakes, or by Earth, than which there can be none more low, nor more miery: So as it is no wonder if these People, being thus favoured by Nature, were both so sierce in taking up Arms against <hi>Spain</hi> at first, and with the like animosity maintained them till they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their own peace. <hi>Bentivog: Hist: of Fland: Pag.</hi> 73.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43370:25"/>
of them growing greater, as they draw neerer the Ocean, before they fall thereinto, they joyn together in divers spacious <hi>Gulphs;</hi> among which the Islands of <hi>Zealand</hi> are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buried than raised up; so low are they seated, and so oft doth the Sea do mischief there. This low si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation is notwithstanding endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be remedied by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants with exceeding high, and firm Banks. But this remedie doth not alwayes give them security, of which the Island of <hi>Zuitbevolant</hi> hath had sad experience, it having in former time been one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, and best peopled of all the <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Islands. In the year 1532, the Sea arose with one of the most ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Tempests that was ever seen in those Parts, and rending the Banks asunder, and bearing down what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever withstood it, it overflowed from the one side to the other, and did actually drown a great part of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43370:25"/>
the Island, to the utter and most horrible destruction both of man and Beast, and a great number of intire Villages, which were misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly swallowed up by that Deluge.

               <p>Towards the South they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with Rampars, and Banks made, and with great pains and charge maintained by the People, being ten <hi>Flemish</hi> Ells high, and twenty five thick at the bottom.

They are made of the hardest clay that can be gotten: within they are thick built with Wood, and Stone, and covered without with Mats strongly wrought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zealand</hi> is a very fruitful Country, and produces excellent pure and bright Corn; great quantities of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander, and Bay Trees that bring forth ripe Berries, which grow not in any Province of the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> besides: It produces also abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of good Madder, and diverse other simples.

                     <hi>Ostend</hi> stands upon the Sea-shoar, in the midst of a Marish ground, and of divers Channels which come from the Continent: But chiefly its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed almost on all sides by two of the greatest of those Channels by which the Sea enters into the Land, and grows so high, when it is full Sea, as that you would rather think the Town was buried than si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate in the Sea. Formerly it was an open Town, and was rather an
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43370:47"/>
habitation for Shepherds than for Souldiers. But the opportunity of the Seat being afterwards considered, the Houses were enclosed with a Platform instead of a Wall; and from time to time, the Line was so flankt round about, as it proved to be one of the strongest Towns in all <hi>Flanders.</hi> Its divided into two parts, called <hi>The Old Town,</hi> and <hi>The new Town.</hi> The former, which is the lesse, stands towards the Sea: The latter, and greater, lyes towards the Land. The old Town is fenced from the fury of the Sea by great Piles of Wood driven into the ground, and joyned together for the defence of that Part, and there the Waves suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently supply the office of a Ditch. The Channels may be said to do the like on the sides, especially at full Sea, when, of Channels, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Havens, being then capable of any kind of Vessel; and by them, at all times, Barks of a middle size enter
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43370:48"/>
into the Ditches, and by them into divers parts of the Town it self: The Town is but of a small compass, and is ennobled rather by its situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and fortifications, than by any splendor of the Inhabitants, or Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>

are not answerable in number to the Houses; many of which being Ecclesiasticks, Forraign Commerce and Merchandizing doth rather lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish than flourish there: Neither doth the <hi>Scheld</hi> yeild commodity for it.

                  <p>The City of <hi>Cambray</hi> is about a League in Compass, and is enviro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with an Ancient Wall, flankt for the most part after the ancient Mode, but with many Bulwarks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, after the Modern Way of Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
