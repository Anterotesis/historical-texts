         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER sent from a Gentleman in

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have taken this opportunity of my Friends going
over, to send you the enclosed Papers: which,
if you think to find your account by it, you may
publish, only I would have you by no means to
disclose my name, while I continue abroad, for
reasons you may easily guess.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE first of these two little <hi>Tracts;</hi>
I met with here at <hi>Paris,</hi> printed
in <hi>French.</hi> If it be not so quick
and smart, as should Answer the
reproof of so great Offenders:
at least I am sure the length of
it cannot be tedious. It is in a manner but a
<hi>Table of the Iesuites Conduct in managing their
Worldly Interest:</hi> and so you ought rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<hi>truth</hi> in it, than <hi>wit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98227:3"/>The Other is what I met with in <hi>Manuscript,</hi>
and (I believe) never yet Printed. The Copy
I made use of, was written in <hi>French,</hi> and
not very Correct: But however there may be
mistakes in some little words; I dare undertake
in the whole it is true; not to be denyed, but by
an impudence whose practice will give it self the
Lie at the same instant. It was found amongst
the Papers of a <hi>Iesuite,</hi> that Died not so near
his Friends, as he might have wished. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he that found it, placed this Text under the
Title of it: <hi>There is nothing covered, that shall
not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be some, who either have not so well
Considered the general Transactions of the
World, or are partially devoted to the Society,
will judg these accounts too extravagant for the
<hi>Iesuites</hi> ever to undertake. But if they please
to go along with me a little further, I make no
doubt but they will change their minds.</p>
            <p>Let us then but look round Christendome,
and see in what posture these good <hi>Fathers</hi> stand.
The <hi>Emperour</hi> is by the confession of all men
beset with them: whose head they fill so full of
Musick, That by their good will they would
leave room for nothing else. The King of <hi>Spain</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98227:3"/>
is a Child, but his Mother (the Queen Regent)
has taken care that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> shall not lose their
share in him, having placed Father <hi>Nidard</hi> her
Confessour the first in her Council, as Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.
How well he has answered that Trust, let
the Revolt of <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> and the high discontent
of all the <hi>Nobility</hi> witness: now in a time when the
lowness of <hi>Spains</hi> fortune lays them open for a
prey to all their Neighbours. The King of <hi>France</hi>
his last Confessour was Father <hi>Anat,</hi> whose
peaceable and quiet behaviour appears suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
out of the Writings of the <hi>Iansenists.
Flanders</hi> is wholly rid by the <hi>Iesuites. England</hi>
gives as great a Testimony of their busy spirit, as
any other Countrey: where by their Rule of not
suffering any of another Order to succeed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour
in the room of one of them, they have
almost thrust out all other, Regulars as well as
Seculars. Of which there is no small complaint
made in these and other parts. Nay, the late
Pope himself had a <hi>Iesuite</hi> his Confessour, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Palavicino,</hi> without whom he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
nothing of Religion or Conscience, which
were managed accordingly, as may be seen in
several Accounts of his Worthy Deeds. It
would be too much to set down their present
<pb facs="tcp:98227:4"/>
Condition in every little Court and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
since it is manifest by what has been
said, that they insinuate themselves into Princes
and other Great Men, for no other good, but
their own.</p>
            <p>I had forgot the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who was
brought up a Novice among them. However,
to give light into their particular actions, I will
only make bold to hint at two or three passages.
The first shall be that of their dealing with the
<hi>Dominicans</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> concerning the Immaculate
Conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> The <hi>Dominicans</hi>
as more addicted to truth, denied the thing:
upon which the <hi>Iesuites</hi> took occasion to shew
that hatred they had always bore them, under
pretence of their zeal for so considerable a
Superstition. And therefore they have recourse
to the <hi>Pope,</hi> pressing him to decide the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
on their behalf. He not willing to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
a point that had so little reason, and no
Antiquity for it; would not resolve; but only
in some measure to gratifie their importunity,
sends a kind of Declaration into <hi>Spain—That
though it was true, The Immaculate Conception
could not be made out, so as to enjoyn the Believing
of it: yet he esteemed it as the more reverend Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb facs="tcp:98227:4"/>
and could wish all Christians rather to be of it.</hi>
But though his Holiness would not speak out
himself, the <hi>Iesuites</hi> made him. For upon these
very words they raise a persecution against the
<hi>Dominicans,</hi> telling the people, that though the
<hi>Pope</hi> had not in express terms Condemned the
<hi>Dominicans,</hi> yet Implicitly he had, by declaring
his own sense so much for the other: Thus did
they put the cheat upon the peoples understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.
But that their Industrious influence may
appear the more; you shall see they will not
forbear to pick pockets when time serves. For
in <hi>Sivil</hi> they set up a Bank, where any man might
put in his money, to be remanded again at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
This they kept in great credit, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by their Trade in the <hi>West-Indies.</hi> At last,
when they perceived most of the stock of City &amp;
Country was got into their hands, presently they
returned all over into the <hi>Indies,</hi> and broke. The
people came upon them for their money, They
as <hi>Church-men</hi> pretend exemption from the <hi>Civil
Courts:</hi> and have so baffled the deceived people,
that I believe e're this they are in despair of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
one farthing.</p>
            <p>And now I have taken notice of their traffick
in <hi>India,</hi> let me refer you to the Letter of <hi>Iohn
<pb facs="tcp:98227:5"/>
Palafox de Mendoza</hi> Bishop of <hi>Angelopolis</hi> in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
&amp;c. to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the X. dated the 8<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1649. And the <hi>Memorial</hi> presented
to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in Defence of <hi>Don Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dino
de Cardenas</hi> Bishop of <hi>Paraguay</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi>
&amp;c. against the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> both put out in
<hi>French.</hi> In both which, the <hi>insolence, ambition,</hi>
and <hi>wickedness</hi> of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> is so discovered,
that were it not recorded upon such publike Acts,
the proceedings would be Incredible. For it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
there, that to serve their own ends, they
made use of <hi>Pagans</hi> to shed <hi>Christian</hi> blood, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to murder their Bishop, and such other
horrid attempts, as must, no doubt, render them
odious to all posterity. The <hi>Eighteenth Canon</hi> of
the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> was so little in their
minds, that they did not so much as observe the
common dictates of <hi>Humanity.</hi> But when a
<hi>Raviliac</hi> has been found amongst them so near
hand; and not only <hi>Libells</hi> scattered abroad to
justify such proceedings, as <hi>Admonitio ad Regem
Ludovicum xiij,</hi> and <hi>Mysteria Politica;</hi> but Books
publikely owned and authorized by Themselves,
written by <hi>Mariana, Aquaviva,</hi> and others, but
chiefly by <hi>Santarel,</hi> who was censured for it by
all the <hi>Vniversities</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> with the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:98227:5"/>
of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> as may be seen
at large in the Book called, <hi>The pernicious Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of the Iesuites new Heresie.</hi> I say, when
we have such sufficient testimony so near home:
we need not make any long voyage for their
discovery.</p>
            <p>Now, that it may appear they have all quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
alike, do but consult the <hi>Provincial Letters,</hi>
and you will find the Morals of these men, as
notoriously faulty, as the rest. For it is plain
there, from the pens of their own approved
Authours, <hi>Tannerus, Emanuel Sa, Hurtado, Castro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palao,
Fagundes,</hi> &amp;c. that <hi>Murder, Sacrilege, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,
Fraud,</hi> or any other sin, may by the
small change of a thought, or easy application
of an intent, either be turned into a virtue, or
at least lose its vitiousness, and become an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
action.</p>
            <p>And why should we then wonder at any thing
that is reported of these men? For certainly, of
late Times, the Devil has not found more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Instruments for the peaceable damnation
of Souls, than the <hi>Iesuites.</hi> The great Enemy
that so often foyls him, is <hi>Conscience:</hi> which
these decoys of Satan do so sweeten and blind
with religious evasions, that they draw whole
<pb facs="tcp:98227:6"/>
flocks after them into the kingdome of darkness,
with as much alacrity, as a Saint goes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>But that I may not be thought to write an
<hi>Invective;</hi> I do declare, I have no pique against
any of that <hi>Society:</hi> but rather an obligation to
wish their practices more open and generous, and
more suitable to their profession; that so many
great Wits, as they have among them, might be
Conversed with, without hazard of a mans being
brought into some inconvenience. Indeed the
only reason that made me think it requisite to
lay them open in <hi>English</hi> at this time, is to let
all men see, what a pack of Knaves we should
be pester'd with, if ever <hi>Popery</hi> crept in. But,
God be thanked, we have a <hi>Prince</hi> knows them
too well to trust them: and a Government well
enough fortified against their Invasions. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
as a restless sort of people, that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
Sea and Land to gain <hi>Proselytes,</hi> and will
leave no stone unturn'd to promote their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest:
all the discouragement imaginable shall not
hinder them from making their attempts. And
therefore, since they are not able to break in at
the fore-door, they try to steal in the back way,
by the help of their Journey-men, the <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98227:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by whose means, having once wrought a
Confusion, they hope the more successfully to
fish in troubled waters. And thus they make
themselves as sure of the booty, as the Ape did
of the Chesnut, when he made use of the Cats
foot to pull it out of the fire.</p>
            <p>For this is that they flatter themselves with.
They look upon the <hi>Phanaticks</hi> as a giddy-headed
rabble, without any foundation or principles, to
establish any Religion upon: Fit for any impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but the right. And so they brag here abroad,
that if they could but once see a <hi>Toleration,</hi> it
should be the same satisfaction to them, to find a
Minister of State's or any Great Man's Coach at
a <hi>Conventicle</hi> door, as if it stood at the <hi>Queens
Chappel.</hi> For they do not in the least despair of
success, if they could get the Reins of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
slackned at this rate. Because, say they,
there is none but the judiciously virtuous part of
the Nation can escape our hands: which will
make so slender a party, that it will not be very
difficult to overcome them.</p>
            <p>For first, the <hi>Male-contents</hi> will naturally fall
into our Nets, or the <hi>Phanaticks.</hi> Next, all
<hi>Knaves,</hi> that either want preserment, or would
have more, take to the Side that is for Change,
<pb facs="tcp:98227:7"/>
which we know by experience to be the <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>
And lastly, which make up the body of
most Countreys, those effeminate spirits, whose
reasons are drowned in their fancies, will, as the
<hi>Apostle</hi> testifies, by the spiritual debauchery of
those Creepers into houses, be drawn into any

not of another generation, but of those very

Hatred to His Person, and Rebellion against His
Authority: were a folly not to be exceeded,

JESUITES
Intrigues.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Laws and Constitutions upon which
the Order of the JESUITES is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
make it plainly appear, that
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had a very holy design
in it. And truly in its first Infancy it
gave great hopes, that it would prove
a very fruitful Branch of Christianity:
For as long as these good Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in works of Charity, following the Rules of their
Order: They really did much good, as well by an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Education of Youth, as by converting Souls, and
maintaining the Faith. But as the Divel would have it,
who is no less industrious and cunning in perverting godly
designs, than good men are to advance them, He takes
occasion from the considerableness of the Order, and the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98227:9"/>
mighty progress they had made in so short a time, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the end, it was first ordained for. So that by his
subtlety, instead of their great Charity, which at present
is almost wholly frozen up, he has possessed them with
the two most pernicious affections of the World, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Covetousness. Which brings so great a mischief
upon Christendom, that a greater is hardly to be imagined,
as I shall make appear by the following Discourse. Only
first, I protest before God, that it is neither Interest nor
Passion, which moves me to Write; but only my zeal for
the publick good: For the advancement of which, I
hold my self obliged to employ the utmost of my power,
in hopes that their hypocrisie and practices being laid open
to the Great Men of the World, they will find some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to remedy the Abuse.</p>
            <p>The first thing then to be known is, That the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
Order being particularly applyed to the Education of
Youth, of which there is no Kingdom nor Town, but
stands in great need; it was sought to, in the beginning
far, and near, and highly favoured by many Princes: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that within a few years it was got to as high a pitch,
as others have attained to in many Ages. But this Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which very often is accompanyed with change of
Manners, stirred up in the Successors of Father <hi>Ignatius</hi>
so great a love toward their own Society; that perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themselves it was of more use to the Church of God,
than all the rest, and more proper for the Reformation of
the World; they concluded amongst themselves, that they
were to apply all their skill and endevours to the aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing
of it, since in that they should encrease the true
Militia of Jesus Christ, the good of the whole Church,
and the ancient Patrimony of the Lord, to use their own
terms. And here it is, that I had need have <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98227:9"/>
Subtilty to discover, and the Eloquence of <hi>Cicero</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the strange Method (which many, perchance for its
novelty think it incredible) by which these Fathers go on,
daily advancing their Society. But I will content my self
to observe only some particulars, leaving the rest to be
made out, as shall seem most probable to each mans fancy.
So that, all I intend to do, is, to give some certain heads,
and directions that may serve, as I guess for good grounds
to any, that will make reflections, or discourses upon this
Subject.</p>
            <p>First, these Father <hi>Iesuites</hi> concluded they should never
bring Their Society to that considerable pitch of Greatness
as They aimed at, barely by Teaching, Preaching, Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
the Sacraments, or by their devout Offices of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For though from the very beginning they had
gained upon the affections of a great many, as I told you
before: yet perceiving that after a little time that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
cooled, they much question'd, whether their Order
had not come short in the effectual Captivating of minds.
And therefore they devised two other means for attaining
to their Greatness; First, to endevour with Princes, and
all others to make the rest of the Orders cheap, by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some great. Defects in them. So that by this wicked
application having set up their own Greatness, by the aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of others, they have made themselves Masters of
divers Monasteries and Abbeys, and other considerable
Revenues, depriving the other Orders of Them (which
before were in possession) by slander and calumny: The
next way was, by insinuating themselves into affairs of
State, engaging to their interest the greatest part of the
Princes of Christendom by so cunning and artificial expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients,
as are not easie to imagine. Their Father Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
to whom they all pay an absolute obedience, resides
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98227:10"/>
constantly in <hi>Rome.</hi> He has made choice of certain Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who, because they are always with him are called
Assistants; and there is at least one of every Nation,
from whence they take their distinction, one calling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the <hi>French</hi> Assistant, the other, the <hi>Spanish,</hi> the third,
the <hi>Italian,</hi> the fourth, the <hi>English,</hi> the fifth, the <hi>Austrian,</hi>
and so of all the other Kingdomes and Provinces. The
charge of each Assistant, is to inform the General of all
Transactions of State that pass, either in the Kingdom or
Province, of the which He is Assistant. This He does by
His Correspondents, who residing in the principal City of
that Kingdom, or Province, make a diligent enquiry of
the estate, nature, inclination and designs of the Prince:
of which they advise the Assistants, giving them notice
especially of the discoveries they have made, or any thing
that falls out new. Thus when all their Pacquets are
come to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Father General calls together His Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
who lay open to Him the affairs of the whole
World, discovering to Him the interest and practices of
all Christian Princes. After which when they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
about all that is written, and examined and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the several accompts, They draw the conclusion,
which is to assist one Prince, and oppose another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as it suits with Their interest and profit. And as the
stander by sees more, than the Gamester; so These Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
having before Them, the interest of all the Princes,
do with much more ease contribute to the affairs of Him,
They know disposed to serve Them.</p>
            <p>The next point best worth consideration is the great
pity, that Regulars should interest Themselves in affairs
of State, when Their Order obliges Them only to attend
the saving Their own Souls and others. For the <hi>Iesuites,</hi>
who do concern Themselves more in the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98227:10"/>
than the Seculars Themselves, make it absolutely
necessary that some course should be taken to prevent so
great a disorder, for fear of most dangerous Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>First, the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Confess a great part of the Nobility
of the Popish States, for the more effectual carrying on
of which, the poor are no longer admitted to Confession,
besides very often They are Confessors to the Princes
Themselves. By which means is it not hard for them to
dive into all the designs, and sift out all the resolutions,
as well of Princes, as of Their Subjects, of which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
They give notice to the General or His Assistants at
<hi>Rome.</hi> How eafie is it then to judge, what prejudice this
may do to Sovereigns, when it is by a party that drive on
nothing but their own advantage? For doubtless all the
World will grant, that nothing can be more essential to
the preservation of a State, than Secrecy, by the disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of which the other frequently is broken. And this
is certainly the reason that all wise Princes conceal Their
minds so carefully, learning by experience what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
They get by knowing the designs of others, which,
for the better carrying on of Their affairs, They spare
no cost to inform Themselves of by Embassadours, and
Spyes: though the intelligence proves oftentimes not so
faithful for want of employing skilful Officers.</p>
            <p>But I dare always undertake that the Father <hi>Iesuites,</hi>
that is, the General and His Assistants have the advantage
of true information one way or other, of all things that
pass in the most private Counsells, what by Confessions,
and inquiries of Their Correspondents placed in all the
principal Cities of Christendom, and by the Mediation of
other Their Complices, of which we shall say more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
Thus They know what strength, revenue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98227:11"/>
or designs any Prince has, than He Himself. And
all this at no more charge, than the portage of Letters,
which indeed are something chargeable too. For, as I
have been informed by the Post-Masters, each Courier
costs Them Fifty or Threescore Pounds, and sometimes
more, to the Sum of an Hundred Pounds. By which
you may easily conceive, having so perfect notice of the
interest of each State, They are likewise able to lessen
one Prince to another, weaken Their authority over the
People, raise against Them, what enemies They please,
and make insurrections at home so much the easier, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by the same means of Confession, and Sifting, They
get into the very Souls of Subjects, and so find out, who are
well, or ill-affected. For, by those accounts They have of all
State-affairs, They may easily set Princes at variance, and
possess them with a thousand Suspicions: and by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Subjects minds so well, They may with the
same facility encourage Their contempt of government,
to the breaking out into all manner of sedition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
From all this every man ought to conclude, that
interest of State forbids any Prince to choose for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
of that sort of men, who are so industrious in
prying into affairs of State, and make that benefit of what
they are acquainted with, to use it for a means, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate
Themselves with other Princes. And much less
reason have Princes to suffer Their chief Ministers and
Counsellors, or the Officers of Their Houshold to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to Them: Especially since we live in an Age repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with Persons, which, neither yeelding to the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
in learning, or piety, may be as serviceable, without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
such a hazard, being such as only concern Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the Direction of Souls and Discharging Their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Functions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98227:11"/>But for the better understanding of what we have said
hitherto, and what hereafter shall be said: it must be
abserved, that there are three sorts of <hi>Iesuites.</hi> The
first consists of certain Lay-people of both Sexes; which
having associated Themselves with that Society, live
under it in the performance of a certain blind obedience,
steering all Their actions by the Directions of <hi>Iesuites,</hi>
and are ever in a readiness to execute, what They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
These are for the most part Gentlemen, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
that pass the rest of Their dayes in widowhood, as
likewise wealthy Citizens, and rich Merchants, who like
good Fruit-trees bring plenty of good things to the
<hi>Iesuites,</hi> that is, store of gold and silver. Of this sort
are those women, which are commonly called <hi>Rigotes,</hi>
who being perswaded by These Fathers to despise the
World, are by Them in requital made a harvest of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wheedled out of rich moveables, and other consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
matters. The second kind takes in only men, of
which some are Priests, and others Lay, who though They
live abroad in the World, and many times by the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
good word obtain Pensions, Canonries, Abbeys and
other Revenues, are yet under a Vow to take the habit of
the Society upon the first Order from the Father General,
for which reason they are called <hi>Iesuites</hi> in Vow. It is by
these, the Father <hi>Iesuites</hi> carry on their business so
smoothly, for the establishing Their Monarchy, keeping
Them in all places, and in all Princes Courts, and in
short, wherever any thing of moment passes throughout
Christendom, and this for such service, as shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the seventh particular. The third sort is of
those politick <hi>Iesuites,</hi> in whom all the authority rests,
who hold the reins of government over their Order,
and who being accosted by the Devil with the same tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98227:12"/>
our Saviour underwent in the Desart, <hi>All these
things will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and Worship
Me,</hi> have taken Him at His Word, and thus in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with Sathan do with might and main prosecute the
Universal Monarchy. Now as almost all the important
affairs of Christendom are passed at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that There
it is, the chief of These noble politicians reside, that is
to say, Their General with a great number of the Order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
So is it upon the same place They have determined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Their Dominion, as They may easily perceive, who
will but take notice of Their behaviour There. Very
hardly shall you transact any thing in that Court, but the
<hi>Iesuites</hi> who have notice of all that passes of importance
will presently meet in Counsell to determine an issue
that may be favourable to Their interest. There you
shall find Them running to the Cardinals, the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dours,
and the Prelates, where bringing about the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse
to the affair Then in treaty, or to be treated of
They represent it, as They please, always considering
Their own advantage, and for that cause often so dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guising
the matter, as to make White appear Black, and
Black White. Thus the first Relation, especially from
men of a religious Order, making the greatest impressio<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
upon the Spirit of Him, that hears, it falls out frequently
that business of importance proposed by Embassadours
and other Great men to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath no<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that success, as Princes could wish: and all this by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
spirits prepossessed by These Worthy <hi>Iesuites</hi> wit<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
partial accounts, which forestalls the Credit, that ough<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to be given to others, who explain Themselves with mor<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
truth and sincerity. Nor is this at <hi>Rome</hi> alone that The
impose these Cheats: but likewise in other Courts, eithe<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
by Themselves, or the <hi>Iesuites</hi> of the second rank
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98227:12"/>
Whence we may conclude, that the greatest part of the
Affairs of Christendom pass through the <hi>Iesuites</hi> hands, and
that those only succeed which they think not fit to oppose.
All this while I must confess, that their address to engage
themselves in Affairs, either for the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or favouring
of them, is so artificial, that 'tis im<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ble throughly
to see into it, so as to give a perfect description: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it shall be no hard matter for any particular Prince to
discover so far as his own Concern requires, if he will but
take the pains to peruse this short Account that I shall
give; because I know it will make him reflect immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon what is passed, by which calling to mind the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
circumstances of his former Treaties, by comparing
them with my observations, it is impossible but he must
descry the subtle dealing of the Society. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this sly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and close management be the chief Engine
they work with, to accomplish their Monarchy, which
is their principal aim; yet they do not omit other means
now and then (so has their Passion blinded them) that
lays open their Ambition to all the World. Was it not a
pleasant request they made, under pretence of a publick
good for the Church, to <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth, That
he would give Order to his Legates and Nuncio's, each of
them to take a <hi>Iesuite</hi> for his Confident, to advise in all
business?</p>
            <p>The fourth thing that requires our consideration, is
that by these devices, and their understanding in Affairs
of State; the Principal <hi>Iesuites</hi> are struck into a great
league of Friendship with many Princes, Temporal and
Spiritual; whom they make believe, that they have done
them great service: And from this one advantage have
proceeded very great mischiefs. The first is, that by
making ill use of the Princes kindness, they take upon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98227:13"/>
them to wrong a great many private Families, which
though Wealthy and Noble, have been brought to utter
ruin by the <hi>Iesuites</hi> ingrossing of Widowes Estates, and
by indirect means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inveigling many young Gentlemen into
their Order, th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave been sent to their Colledges for
Education. F<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>w often do we find it, that when
these young Gentlemen grow sickly, or are found uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of performing the Duty belonging to their Order,
they are dismissed without ever having restitution of their
Estates made to them, or theirs, the <hi>Iesuites</hi> having got
possession before ever they would let them Profess? This
is far from that justice <hi>Ignatius</hi> has enjoyned them; and
no way consonant to that first intention their Founders
had, who left them not according to their insatiate
avarice, but enough to keep them in a condition to serve
the Church.</p>
            <p>The second misfortune, which follows from the access
these <hi>Iesuites</hi> have to Princes, is, that the Fathers boast,
and cunningly make the World believe, their intimacy
with Great Men to be more, than indeed it is. And by
this they awe the very Ministers of State, and cause them
to seek their Favour, and Petition them for whatsoever
they would have pass. Nay, their vanity is encreased
to that degree, as they are so impudent to boast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
able to make Cardinals, Nuntio's, Lieutenants,
Governours and other Officers, so far that some had the
face to say, <hi>Their General could do more, than the Pope
himself;</hi> and others, <hi>That it was better to be of that Order
which could make Cardinals, than be one themselves.</hi> I am not
at all afraid, that what I have said will make me pass for
a Slanderer; because the Fathers speak it all so openly
themselves, that hardly any one, who has conversed with
them, has not heard them say the very same thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98227:13"/>The fifth point is, after the foundation of Policy laid,
that the first thing they demand of those Princes, into
whose good opinion they are got, is to obtain leave to
advance or suppress whom they please, always pretending
Religion, to make their request more acceptable. And
when it so unfortunately falls out, that they have their
will, which is but too often; you must not expect that
they fill up Vacancies with men of desert, and such as
are best able to discharge the Duty of the Place; quite
contrary, if any one recommend such Persons to the Prince,
they shall use all their interest to hinder it, unless they
prove to be some of their Intimates, such as are wholly
devoted to their service. But those they recommend and
stand for, it is no matter how ill affected they are to the
Prince, or how great Knaves, capable of the Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or not, that does not at all concern them. By which
ordinarily we find, that such Officers, as they prefer,
serve for nothing but to torment their Prince, and cherish
the People in Discontents, which in the end break out
into Sedition.</p>
            <p>The sixth observation cannot be made out better, than
by the comparison of the Captain of a Ship, who perceiving
a favourable Gale for his Voyage, has no sooner given
notice by his Whistle, but all the Slaves are at their Oars,
to make for the Place appointed. For it is almost after
the very same manner, when the General has concluded
with his Assistants, that such a person should be so preferred;
the first notice he gives of his purpose to those that reside
upon the place, has a general influence to set them all
at work, tooth and nail, to set <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Person so marked
out. It follows then that he which has received so signal
an obligation, must be very ungrateful, if he does not
requite it, when it lies in his power, By which it comes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98227:14"/>
to pass many times, that they esteem themselves more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> than the Prince who gives them
the Office, and so more devoted to their Interest, than
to his Honour and advantage. Thus are Princes fooled,
who whilst they fancy they have got a faithful Servant,
have taken into their breast a Spy of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> who
oftentimes by that means work the ruin of the Prince,
that raised him. This and all the rest I have mentioned
are so great Truths, that I could easily give many Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of them by sad experience. But because I would not
unnecessarily contract an odium upon my self, I shall omit
them, and content my self to draw only this conclusion
from what I have said in this last point, That this Device
of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> to place their own Creatures in great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
is perchance the reason why they call their Order
a Great Monarchy; forasmuch as by this way they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of Princes and their Ministers. And therefore it
ought not to seem strange, that one of their chief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
having a publick Address to make to a Great Man
in the name of the Society, let fall this arrogant expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>You know very well (Sir) that our Society have alwayes
held a fair Correspondence with your Highness;</hi> importing,
no doubt, that they were Monarchs, as well as he.</p>
            <p>In the seventh place, these Fathers endevour, as much
as in them lies, to make the World believe, that all those
that receive any favour from a Prince, are to acknowledge
it from their Intercession, or some of their Creatures.
And this gives them a greater power over the Subject,
than his natural Prince; which cannot certainly be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
very great danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It being against all reason, that
such froward and amb<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ous Youths, as the <hi>Iesuites</hi> are,
should have the Will of Ministers of State at their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose.
For besides that they have an opportunity by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98227:14"/>
this means to work what Treason or Distubance they
please, they have an infallible expedient by these Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
(their Creatures) to place their <hi>Iesuites</hi> in Vow, of
which we spake before, about Princes, either in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of Counsellors, Secretaries, or what else offers
it self. And no sooner these are in, but that they plye
the Prince night and day to perswade him to take a <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite</hi>
for his Confessor, or Chaplain at least, and all to
make Spies for the Father General, to whom they give
account of the most private passages. Which is, no
doubt, the cause that it so often comes to pass, that what
has been thought to have been carryed most secretly, has
become publick when least dreamt of; and that we find
undertakings of the highest importance frustrated, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being able to imagine who was the Traytor; and what
is yet worse, oftentimes they undergo the blame, who
least deserv'd it.</p>
            <p>The eigth particular to be noted, is, that as it is natural
for the Subject to follow the inclination of his Prince; so
all those who have given themselves up to the Father Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
when they observe his close and passionate applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to State-Affairs, and that he makes it his own business,
by this means to aggrandise and enrich his Society, they,
like Apes, immediately take after their Leaders, and
turn all Politicians to help in carrying on, as they suppose,
so glorious a project. To this end they set their Relations
and Friends at work to get into the hearts of Princes, and
discover their most secret thoughts, ever making report
to the Assistants and General upon the first notice. For
being well assured, that it is the only way to procure their
Superiors good will, and by consequence Preferment
(which is bestowed upon none but such as are thought ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of exalting their Society to that pitch they aim at)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98227:15"/>
they make it their business to recommend themselves, by
some politick Atchievement, that they may be looked
upon as fit to manage greater Affairs.</p>
            <p>My ninth observation therefore shall be, that as by
virtue of the Alembeck, Chymists know how to extract
Ointments for the Cure of almost mortal Wounds, and as
the Bee makes her honey up of the choice of diverse flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
so the <hi>Iesuites</hi> by strength of Reason, compose their
own Interest out of the faithful Intelligence they have of
the Concerns of all Princes, and of all Occurrences of
State; by which they do not only refresh that inward
thirst of becoming Great, but make likewise a mighty
advantage in understanding their own emolument, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of which, they beat down all before them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
their ends. But, what is most remarkable, when,
as we have said before, they are got into the hearts of
Princes, they are used to play them off, by assuring them,
what excellent expedients they have for putting such a
plot in practice, and to bring about such a design. But
scarcely will they have begun in their assistance according
to engagement, but that upon consideration of some
inconvenience this addition of Greatness to a Prince,
whom they have hitherto fed with fair hopes, may bring
to them, they create a thousand delaies, like Advocates
in a Process at Law, and then upon a sudden, by some
excellent sleight of contrivance, turn all into confusion,
and so break the neck of that Plot themselves had laid.
He that will but reflect upon the League of <hi>France,</hi>
which being carryed on, and concluded by them, was
likewise detected, when they saw the King was like to
get the better; and upon <hi>England,</hi> which they so often
promised to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> will need no other proof to
make out the truth of what I have said.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:98227:15"/>May we not then very justly draw this conclusion from
the whole, That the <hi>Iesuites</hi> having no real or sincere
kindness for any, nor will oblige the World beyond their
own Interest, neither Prince nor Prelate can make use
of them without injury to themselves. For at the same
instant they pretend a like respect to all, becoming
<hi>Monsieurs</hi> with the <hi>French, Dons</hi> with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and
so with all other Countreys, as occasion serves, and hopes
of advantage. They are very indifferent who it is they
do harm or good to. And, no doubt, it is that excessive
Self-Interest, and the little regard they have to any mans
Concern else, which makes few enterprises succeed, in
which they have a hand. However I must allow, that
they have an incomparable art in concealing this indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
some of them still pretending a great zeal for the
Crown of <hi>France,</hi> others for that of <hi>Spain,</hi> others for
the Emperour, and for all the rest of the Princes from
whom they expect any favour. But if it so fall out, that
some one of these Princes takes a <hi>Iesuite</hi> into his Cabinet-Counsels,
this fellow shall no sooner know any thing,
but that he will advise the Father General of it, who
presently sends back his result upon it, in order to which
he proceeds, without consideration either of his Princes
Will or Service.</p>
            <p>And though these I have already declared, are very
great inconveniences; I will shew you yet greater. The
first is, That the <hi>Iesuites</hi> being fully informed of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Interests and Counsels of Princes, they amongst
them that feign themselves to be of the <hi>French</hi> Faction,
propound to the King, or his chief Ministers, certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
of State, which may be of some weight,
such as have been sent from <hi>Rome</hi> in their politick Letters.
Those which flatter the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> or any other
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98227:16"/>
Government, where they have access make other propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
in these places, quite contrary to the former, or
at least such as may keep Christian Princes at a distance to
be in perpetual jealousies one of another, which disturbs
the common Peace more than can be imagined, and brings
a misfortune upon all Christendom. For, such a defiance
hinders all possibility of joyning against the Common
Enemy; and indeed makes all Treaties of Peace between
Princes signifie very little. The second inconvenience is,
That by these subtle practices they have so opened the
eyes of all people, that no body minds any thing else but
the Politicks: So as nothing is done now a dayes, that is
not first weighed in this balance, nor any business that is
not directed by this <hi>Iesuitical</hi> Compass. But all this
would be nothing to what mischief would ensue, if they
of the Reformed Churches should take up this example,
and abuse their Interest with Princes after this manner.
For then in stead of <hi>Lutherans</hi> (with whom some accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
may, it is hoped, be found out one day) we
should have spring up a politick brood of irreconcilable
Antichrists. And to make it appear, that I have said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the truth, when I have charged the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
with such abominable Artifices, and Collusions, above all
when they are upon insinuating themselves into the favour
of Princes, I must not forget what was done amongst them
some years since upon the Concern of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> One
of their Fathers, an Assistant of that Kingdom, called
Father <hi>Parsons,</hi> having writ a Book against the Right of
the King of <hi>Scots</hi> to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> Father <hi>Criton</hi>
with others of the same Order defended the Kings Cause,
in a Book Intuled, <hi>The Discourse of the King of</hi> Scots <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Opinion of Father</hi> Parsons, or to that purpose.
And though you may suspect by this, that they are divided
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98227:16"/>
among themselves; yet I do assure you, they do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
one another perfectly well. For this Game was
played by the directions of their General, to the end, that
if the <hi>Scotch</hi> were disappointed of the Succession, then
should be shewed, to whoever came in, Father <hi>Parsons</hi> his
Book; or if otherwise, <hi>Scotland</hi> should carry it, then
they should ingratiate themselves by presenting <hi>Criton</hi>'s
Work: And so whatever came uppermost they were
provided with that should make their Society acceptable.
By which you may judge how true it is, that I told you,
Princes are the main object of all the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Designs and
Actions, and therefore reason good, they should esteem
their Order a Great Monarchy. Nay, is not this an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
argument of my assertion, the small care they
take to please any Prince, when their Interest comes in
competition? We have have many experimental Examples
that convince it beyond dispute, if it were worth the
trouble to set them down: I will only give you one,
which shall be as good as a thousand. Every one knows,
that there is none in the World, that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> are in so
high a nature obliged to, and to whom they owe more
fidelity, than the Pope, not only for the particular Vow
of Obedience they make to his Person, but for many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reasons besides. And yet for all this <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> of
blessed memory, having a mind that these Fathers should
officiate in the Chore, and do all things after the manner
of other Regulars; they would never obey him, but
pretended still some great prejudice it would bring upon
them: Only there were some amongst them that submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to His Holiness, and did as they were commanded. But
how did the rest serve them? Were they not by way of
reproach called <hi>Aviatins,</hi> or Starters aside? And was ever
any of them afterwards preferred in the least? Just so
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98227:17"/>
they set themselves against that worthy Person <hi>Charles Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romeo</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Milan,</hi> when, as Legate à <hi>Latere,</hi> he
would have visited their Society amongst the other Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>But (alas!) what is all this? They break even the
holy Canons by trading, expresly against their injunctions,
in Pearls, Rubies and Diamonds, which are brought them
from the <hi>Indies.</hi> And it is generally believed, that the
greatest part of the Jewels which come from the <hi>Indies</hi>
and are sold at <hi>Venice,</hi> pass through their hands. Neither
is this a bare rumour spread abroad by their enemies; for I
have it from those very men, whom they imploy, as Brokers
to put them off. I could produce other Stories, that
should make it as clear, how ill they serve the Pope, and
how dishonestly; but because I can say nothing in it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mentioning a Prince, who would not very well relish
my discourse, I will be silent. For I desire to serve all the
World, and offend no man, not so much as the <hi>Iesuites,</hi>
which otherwise I honour, and against whom I do not in the
least pretend to write an invective; only a little to abate
their pride, and, if possible, make them behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with more moderation, than hitherto they have
done.</p>
            <p>For who is there almost that has not reason to complain
of the <hi>Iesuites?</hi> And yet, just as it falls out many times
with men in desperate diseases, whilst they make lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
complaints to heaven, such as startle every body
that hear them, though each patient very well knows
what kind of a Disease he is visited with, yet not one in
a thousand can tell from what inward cause it proceeds;
so, notwithstanding all the World cries out upon the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,</hi>
some for being oppressed by them, others for not
being so honestly dealt with, as was to be expected from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98227:17"/>
men of their Robe; yet the inconvenience continues, few
perceiving what is the original of this Mischief. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
if one would but look a little into the business, it
would appear plainly, that the immoderate and boundless
passion of making themselves Great, provokes them to
neglect the satisfaction of Princes, and to deceive them,
to oppress the poor, embezel Widows Estates, ruin great
Families, raise suspicions and promote enmities betwixt
Christian Princes, to introduce themselves into their
Affairs. But would it not be a strange irregularity in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
if one of the meanest parts of the body, which was
made only, as a servant to the more noble, should take
to itself the best blood, and the greatest share of the
vital spirits? Could one after such a disorder expect less,
than a dissolution of the whole? The abuse in Church
and State is no less; when we see the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Order,
which is come in, one of the last, and erected for the
Conversion of Infidels, and drawing sinners to repentance,
assume to itself the Concerns of Prince and Prelate,
drawing out the best, and very life itself of their Affairs
for their own use: Which most assuredly cannot be done
without, both a publick and private disturbance, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under those subjects who most deserve advancement,
and raising none, but the unworthy, with thousands of
other Divels, such monstrous proceedings must call up.</p>
            <p>I could easily bring many reasons here from experience,
besides those I have given, to prove of what a vast extent
the ambition of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> is, and that there is no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in their desires of growing Great. But because I
hate to be tedious, I will only lay before you the project
of Father <hi>Parsons</hi> upon <hi>England,</hi> as he himself has set it
down, in his Book called <hi>The Reformation of</hi> England.
Where after he has fallen upon Cardinal <hi>Pole</hi> (a man of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98227:18"/>
singular piety and worth) and has observed certain faults
and defects in the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> he concludes at last,
that supposing <hi>England</hi> should fall back to the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> he would put it into the Condition of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church. For this purpose, all the Ecclesiastical
Revenues must be brought into one common Stock, the
care and dispensation of which, he would have committed
to seven discreet persons, taken out of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Society,
to distribute, as they should think fit. Moreover, he
would have all other Orders forbid coming into this
Kingdom under severe penalties, only such as they shall
permit, which according to his judgment must be none
but the begging Orders. But as it is the usual fate of
self-love to blind those it has mastered, and be they never
so wise, make them guilty of the greatest follies: I do not
much wonder at what this Father adds, England (says he)
<hi>being once brought back to the Truth, the Pope must not, for
at least five years after, think of making any profit out of the
Church-Revenues, but remit the whole entirely to the seven,
who shall dispose of them, as they think best for the Churches
advantage.</hi> In good earnest a man must be very dull, that
should not perceive their whole design to be to amuse, or
rather cheat the Pope by such a proposal, hoping at the
five years end to find out some other trick, which seldom
fails them, to keep it five years longer, and so by degrees
shut His Holiness quite out. Does not this demonstrate
their greedy ambition to an undeniable degree? Can
any man after this, doubt of their aspiring thoughts of a
Monarchy? Do not the arts they use, put it past dispute?
And do they not at the same time, make it manifest, that
so they have their Ends, they are indifferent, as to the
rest, whether advantaged or ruined by it? In the time of
<hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth, they made it their request, to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98227:18"/>
be invested with all the Churches of <hi>Rome,</hi> no doubt that
they might found their Empire in the Capital City of the
World: But that which was deny'd them for <hi>Rome,</hi> was upon
their importunity, granted them for <hi>England,</hi> where they
made him confer the Dignity of Arch-Priest upon a <hi>Iesuite</hi>
in Vow, who instead of protecting the Ecclesiasticks, plays
the Divel against all Priests, that have no dependance u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> so far as to hinder their communication
one with another, though but to discourse, which has
made them almost desperate. Therefore it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
if at present most of all the Priests in <hi>England</hi> are
<hi>Iesuites</hi> in Vow; since, besides the reasons I have already
given, they admit none into the Colledges, but such as pass
their word to take the habit of the Society. So that
if <hi>England</hi> should slide back again, there is no question
of it, but that it would give beginning to an established
Monarchy of the <hi>Iesuites;</hi> because the Bishopricks, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
and generally, all the other Benefices and Church-revenues
would be bestowed upon <hi>Iesuites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No wonder then, if after this we hear of so few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
especially in that Nation we last spoke of. For
first, the old Stock of Priests which formerly made a
great harvest, that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> falsly attributed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
is near worn out. And these Youths are more
zealous in promotihg their own Interest, than in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Souls. And then besides the Protestants ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the tyranny of the JESUITES over other
Priests of their own Religion, and how they juggle in
all their dealings, have taken so great an aversion, that
for fear of coming under the same lash themselves, they
think of nothing less, than a change. I will say nothing
here of their imaginary pretences to a certain State, nor
the discourses they continually buz in a Princes ears of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98227:19"/>
the great share they boast to have in the hearts of his
people, by which they make him believe, they keep
them in their Allegiance and Loyalty towards him. It
shall suffice for conclusion of my Discourse, only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
four Considerations.</p>
            <p>I. That Men so ambitious, and that drive on such
Designs, must needs be lovers of change and novelty.
And therefore being able to create them, when they
please, by putting men in Arms, the Conduct of which
I have shewed you, how good they are at, it is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
impossible they should forbear; Hence you may
easily judge, That no Prince ought to have any kindnes<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
for them, who loves Peace and the preservation of hi<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
State. For I have already made it appear, they can
do him no more service, than what may, as well be don<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
by others: But then they may ingage him in a thousand
troubles, and it may be, promise his Dominions to
another, if he entertains them in his Territories, and
does not shew them respect enough, by governing
himself after their Directions, which is of equal
danger.</p>
            <p>II. If without any temporal Jurisdiction they make suc<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
a bussle in the world; what would become of us, if unluckily
any of them should happen to be Pope? No doubt, h<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
would fill the Consistory with <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and so entail th<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Papacy upon themselves. Going on then, as they have done
and setting their Interest for a Rule, and having a Pop<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
with all his power to back them; were it not to b<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
feared that the Dominions of many Princes would be in
jeopardy, especially those that bordered upon St. <hi>Peter'<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
Patrimony?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:98227:19"/>III. Such a Pope, chose out of their own Society,
would certainly do his utmost to invest them with some
Town and temporal Jurisdiction, which could not be done
without injury to some Prince.</p>
            <p>IV. If the Consistory were filled with <hi>Iesuites,</hi> the
whole Patrimony and Revenue of the Church would be
in their hands; and as we see a man that has a Dropsie,
the more he drinks, the dryer he is; so doubtless, these
Fathers with such an addition of greatness, would be but
the more covetous of Riches and Honour, in prosecution
of which, the whole world should be disquieted. Now,
all the world knows, nothing is so liable to change as
States, especially where there are those, that never want
boldness to attempt. So that it is very likely the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
in the case we suppose them, would quickly alter
the present state of Affairs, to bring it to their fashion,
and thus to confirm their absolute Monarchy. For,
though hitherto they have done their best to make
themselves acknowledged Monarchs, by drawing into
their Company the Sons of Free Princes, who were
to give up their Rights to them; yet could they never
compass it, because still some other power perceiving
their aim, has crossed their purpose. But if a <hi>Iesuite</hi>
once came to be Pope, then would be their time, after
full possession of the Church-revenues, by their crafty
methods to attain to that so long wished for Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
However I hope, though such an accident might
not prove so fatal, yet the apprehensions of what
may fall out, will be so well considered in behalf of
all Free Princes, that the Conclave will never run the
risk of so dangerous an importance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98227:20"/>From what I have said we may gather this general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
that it is necessary for the preservation of the
publick peace, and the security of Government, that
His Holiness and other Christian Princes give some check
to this Society, whose ambition is got up to that excessive
pitch, as without some speedy prevention will become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediless.
When my advice shall be asked for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this, I am confident they shall be so far from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it amiss, that they will give me thanks for it. All I
would have, being only to make them Monarchs of their
Souls, which are the Elect of Jesus Christ, and leave off
the thoughts of this World, which is but Dirt: And I
offer in Charity to contribute all the help God has inabled
me with the power of.</p>

               <head type="sub">What must be done to get the ear and intimacy of
Princes and Great men.</head>
               <p>THere is great care to be taken in this business. To
bring over any Prince to Us, we must be sure to
take off that prejudice of believing, They have no need
of Us, and perswade Them, what interest We have,
That no man dares lift up his hand against Us.</p>
               <p>Princes have always desired a Jesuite Confessour, when
They have been engaged in hateful practices, that They
might not hear of reproof, but still have some favourable
interpretation put upon Them. This often falls out upon
Matches contracted with near Relations; which are very
troublesome, by reason of the common opinion, That
such Marriages never thrive. And therefore when Princes
are set upon such things, We must encourage Them, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98227:22"/>
espouse Their Concerns, putting Them in hopes, that
We can have what we will of the Pope, and alledge some
reasons, opinions, or examples, which may feed the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
by shewing how Matches of higher consequence
have been approved of for a publick good, and have
many times been indulged to Princes for the greater glory
of God.</p>
               <p>Thus when a Prince attempts any thing; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
He has a mind to make War; We must go along with
Him; fix His mind and resolution upon it, without enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
into particulars, for fear, if things should happen
otherwise than well, the fault should be laid at our door.
And this We may do by pretending Our Rule, which
forbids Us to take knowledge of affairs of that nature.</p>
               <p>To confirm the good will of Princes, it is good to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
some little Embassy, always provided it bring us
in some advantage: by which We may render Our selves
as necessary, as welcome, and let Them see how great Our
power and credit is, as well with the Pope, as all other
Princes.</p>
               <p>There is no better way in the world to win Princes, and
Great Men at Court, than by Presents, which though
never so mean, are better than none at all. And to give
Them a full testimony of Our affections, manners and
inclinations, We must, than which nothing is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to Princes, discover to Them the deportment
and manners of those They have an aversion to. By this
means we shall creep into the hearts of Princes and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees.
Now if They be not married, when we receive
Their Confession, We must propose to Them the Match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into some noble Alliance, to some beautiful Lady,
and a great Fortune, and such, as if they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
at least are very intimate with some of Ours, set
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98227:22"/>
out such Virgins with Commendations suitable to our End
to please These Great Ones. Thus We may by preferring
a Wife make new friendships, as we find by experience
in the House of <hi>Austrich</hi> with the Kindomes of <hi>Poland,</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Dutchies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Women of condition come over to Us, We must
possess Them with as great a love to Our Society as is
possible, and that as well by those that are Our Friends of
their Relation, as by Our selves, to the end they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the more liberal towards Us. Now the way to gain
their affections, is by little Services and trifling Presents,
which will make them lay open their hearts to Us.</p>
               <p>To conduct the Consciences of Noble Persons, We
must follow the opinions of those Authors that write in
a more gentle stile against the rigorous Morals of the
Monks: Which will make Princes reject the latter, to
embrace Our advice and counsel: And thus They shall
wholly depend upon Us.</p>
               <p>Therefore to have the good Will of Princes, Prelates
and other Great Personages, it is requisite that They be
acquainted with Our great Deserts, and that We shew
Them, how considerable We are in all parts of the World,
and that We are able in a high measure to dispense with
reserved cases, which other Monks cannot do: as to absolve
from Fasting, or Paying any just Debt, Untie the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Marriage, and a thousand other Obligations and
Vows. We must endevour to breed dissention among
Great Men, and raise seditions, or any thing, a Prince would
have Us to do to please Him. If a chief Minister of State
to any Monarch that is Our Friend, oppose Us, and that
Prince cast His whole favour upon Him, so as to add Titles
to His Honour; We must present Our selves before Him,
and court Him in the highest degree, as well by Visits, as
all humble respect.</p>

against Our enemies, and make use of Their partiality
to hook in Houses, Villages, Gardens, Quarries of Stone
for Building, especially in the Towns where we have
Colledges, always purchasing under a strange name of
some Confident of Ours.</p>
               <p>We must be very careful to uphold the Bishops and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioners
revenues for Us; lest They should hinder the
exercise of Our Function, where They have to do. For,
In <hi>Germany, Poland,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the Bishops have great
power, and can with a great deal of ease obtain from
their Prince any Convenience for Us, as Monasteries, new
erected Parishes, the priviledges of Serving at certain
Altars, places devoted to holy uses, and other things,
which must be facilitated by stopping the Seculars mouths
with some small consideration. Besides, We may transfer
to Our own use, what foundations We please, where
Catholicks and Hereticks inhabit together.</p>

                  </gap>derstand, that besides
the meritoriousness of the act in such a case, they will reap
a great benefit: Whereas the Secular Priests and the
Monks would pay them with nothing, but a Song.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:98227:23"/>They ought to have immortal praise for their zeal in so
good a deed, that are the Cause of Our getting into the
foundations of some Seculars, and Canons, which may be
effected with ease by the assistance of These Bishops.</p>
               <p>We must see, that when the Bishops and Princes are
founding any Colledges, we have a perpetual Licence
conferred upon Us to assist the Vicar of the Parish-Churches
in the Cure of Souls; and that for some time
the Superiour be a parishioner himself, so to have the
Church wholly at Our dispose.</p>
               <p>The Bishops must be perswaded to build us Colledges
in those Universities that are our Enemies, and where the
Catholicks and Hereticks hinder Us from having any
foundation; and that as well There, as in any other great
Town, We may have liberty to Preach.</p>
               <p>When there is any design of Canonizing one of Our
Order; the business must be followed by Letters of Grace
from Great men to His Holiness. If occasion so require,
that the Princes must appear in person to solicit, We must
look to it, that no Regular go along with Them, or
attend Them, with whom we hold not Correspondence,
for fear they steal away the Princes affection from Us,
and procure our Colledges, where they have any thing
to do already, to be joined to them to Our prejudice.
Therefore when any person of quality comes within Our
Walls, We must treat Him with all modest respect, and
shew of piety.</p>

               <p>THat Princes and other men of Degree may be fully
satisfied that Our whole design is the Great glory of
God, which Our Society has chose for their particular
cognisance; We must pretend all the resolution and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the World. And afterwards try, how pliable They
are to Our Instructions, not all at once, but by degrees,
screw Our selves into their politick Concerns of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Revenue. To arrive thus far, We must often
inculcate, that They ought not confer Honours, Charges,
Offices, or other preferments, but upon such as are able,
and of integrity, and that have merited by some notable
Service. Make them sensible, how great a sin it is to do
the contrary, always dissembling our intention to meddle
in any thing of that nature, protesting against it with all
asseverations, making it only a Case of Conscience, in the
station We are to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>If then the Prince be put to a stand what to do: He
must be told, what endowments and capacity They ought
to have who are to fill up such or such places, and how
they ought to demean themselves. We must suffer none
to come in, that are not of our Intimates. Therefore let
the Prince hear again and again, that to employ men of
integrity and good lives, will be highly for His honour,
absolutely necessary for the maintenance of true Religion,
and the good of His people. Which persons must never
be nominated by any we are not sure of, but by some of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98227:24"/>
our fast friends. Thus we shall strike up a mutual obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and be the more cheerfully served upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>The Confessours and Chaplains must get out of our
Friends, what Lands or Money the eminent men have,
whether virtuous, and bountiful, and be sure to keep a
Catalogue of their names, and then neatly recommend
them to the Prince, that so the way may be laid open for
preferment, when any falls worthy of them. But they
must mark out those in the first place, that by Confession
they discover to be well enclined to Us.</p>
               <p>Above all, they must be sure to handle Princes, and
others, with all easiness and satisfaction, and not to press
them too much in their Confessions, or Sermons. They
that retain to Princes must have very little money, and be
mean in their furniture, contenting themselves with some
poor little hole, as in appearance most mortified persons,
and avoid the suspicion of flattery. For by such a discreet
carriage they may prevail easily with the Prince to do
nothing, in Church or State without their advice.</p>
               <p>All diligence must be used to get the names of all the
Officers of State, to change or continue, as shall be
thought most expedient, but without giving ground to
suspect the removalls come from Us. And this must be
brought about by some of our friends, that are near the
Prince, who may effect it without mistrust.</p>

               <p>FOr this purpose must be called out some of the Fathers
of the livelyest fresh complexions, and of a middle
age. These must frequent Their houses, and if they find
a kindness towards our Society, impart to Them its great
worth. If they come to our Churches, we must put a
Confessour to them, that shall perswade them to continue
in their Widowhood, representing to them the great
pleasure, delight and advantage will accrue to them by
remaining in that state: and this they must be assured of,
and promised an eternal reward, and that this only thing
will exempt them from Purgatory.</p>
               <p>Set them up a little Chappel, and an Altar neatly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
the minding of which may put the thoughts of a
Husband out of their heads. For the better effecting of
which, frequent Masses must be said there, and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
given.</p>
               <p>To facilitate the business they must be induced to lessen
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98227:26"/>
their family, and to take Stewards, and other Officers of
our recommendation, and place some of our Creatures
about them in the House. So that by degrees, having got
a perfect knowledge of all the circumstances of their
Concerns, and their devotion to our Society, we may at
last place what Officers we please about them. The first
thing that their Confessours are to do, is to get into their
Counsels, and to let them understand how necessary it is
for the good of their souls to give themselves wholly up
into their hands. They must be advised to Receive often,
to assist at Divine Service, to repeat the Litanies over, to
take a daily examination of themselves, and their Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
must assist them in choosing out some Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-Saints
for their Tutelaries, especially recommending
the Founder of our Order. Let them be exhorted to make
an entire Confession, that knowing their faults, humours,
and instructions, from beginning to end, it may serve them
as a direction to bring them about to our purpose.</p>
               <p>Twice or thrice a week must be given them a Lecture
in commendation of a Widows life, and how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
vexations and charges a second Marriage incurrs.</p>
               <p>Being thus induced to continue in Their Widowhood,
presently they must be put upon entring into some reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Order, not in a Cloister, but after the manner of
<hi>Paulina.</hi> Thus when they are caught in the Vow of chastity,
all danger of their Marrying again is over. They must
then be earnestly pressed not to admit young people into
their Court, such as are given to Courting of Ladies,
Play, Musick or Poetry; That they avoid much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
But let all this be done with such a moderation,
as may prevent any complaint of our rigour towards
them, for fear of a just repriment.</p>
               <p>All Presentations, Chaplains, and the like, in their
gift, must be disposed of by us. By this we shall insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98227:26"/>
get ground upon them, perswading them to deeds
of charity, and giving alms, without which they can
never gain the Kingdome of Heaven. Always provided,
they never bestow any charity without the advice and
consent of their ghostly Father: because it is very material
to be assured upon whom, or how a charity is placed to
make it acceptable to God. For they must understand,
that alms ill-bestowed will rather do hurt, than good. And
if they do not believe, how much it contributes to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation
of their sins; they must neither be allowed so much
liberty nor liberality.</p>

               <p>VVIdows must be frequently minded of continuing
in their devotion, of performing charitable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
to let no week pass without doing some good work
of their own voluntary motion, to the honour of the
holy Virgin, cutting off all superfluous expences, and
distributing something extraordinary to the poor, and the
Churches of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Now, if besides this general good disposition, they give
any testimony of a particular bounty towards us, whether
by any great sum of money, or otherwise: we must make
them entire partakers in the merits of our Company, and
to set the better gloss upon it, let it be confirmed by the
Provincial, or if need be, by our General.</p>
               <p>If any of our Widows break their Vow of chastity,
they shall be shrived by their Confessours twice a year
with a renewing of their Vow, that the freshness of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98227:27"/>
memory of it may oblige them the more to us. And upon
the day of their reconciliation, they may have leave to
recreate themselves with any civil divertisement.</p>
               <p>It must be proposed to them to live after our Rule, and
if they think fit, that all their Attendants and Domesticks
do the like.</p>
               <p>They ought to be perswaded to come to Confession
every month, as well upon the Feasts dedicated to our
Saviour, as Those to the holy Virgin; The Apostles, the
Patron they have made choice of, and principally St. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
and St. <hi>Xavier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Place Syndikes with them to have an eye upon both
men and women in their Court, and to discover their
miscarriages, for our better information, but not to take
any notice of the Widows vow of Chastity.</p>
               <p>The Domesticks must be forbid to look scornfully, or
talk of things behind peoples backs, which grows ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
into contempt. And therefore offenders in that
kind are to be severely chastised, or else by the Widows
leave turned out of doors.</p>
               <p>These Widows must be served by civil Maids of our
recommendation, such as have skill in working several
ornaments for our Churches, which may be a means to
give their Ladies a pious divertisement.</p>
               <p>We must place a Governess over these Maids of our
own choosing, that may keep them constantly at work,
and have a strict eye over them.</p>
               <p>Visit the Widows, as often as we may be welcome, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
them with pleasing discourses, and godly stories,
and keep up the cheerfulness of their humour, and never
be too severe with them in Confession, lest they take
distaste at us: unless there be no hopes left of making any
advantage by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:98227:27"/>We must comfort them, and advise them to go often
to Confession, that in relyance upon this consolation, They
may be wholly ours, body and goods.</p>
               <p>If there be any hopes of frighting them into good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
we may be a little more rough with them: But a
Confessour must do this with great caution, and not before
he hath consulted with the Superiours.</p>
               <p>It is of great importance for the gaining a Widow's
friendship, to give Them a particular privilege of coming
into our Colleges upon some solemn performances, as the
acting a Tragedy, or such like: and not to let Them go
abroad in extreme cold weather: and to dispense with
Their Fasting, or wearing Sack-cloth, which may be taken
off by Alms. That thus They may be satisfied we are
not less sollicitous for the health of their bodies, than
their souls.</p>
               <p>We must hinder Them, as much as in us lies, from
going to the Churches of other Orders, upon their Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
days: and convince them, that all the indulgencies of
other Orders are comprised in Ours.</p>
               <p>Let them be as sensual as they please, provided
they are liberal, kind to our Society, and handle the
matter so, as not to give scandal.</p>
               <p>When they are in consideration, how to dispose of
their Estates: they must have laid before them the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Saints, who have forfeited their blood,
parents and friends, and cheerfully relieved the poor
Members of Christ. Here it is, that we must represent
that Crown they shall receive, if they give themselves,
and theirs, up to us.</p>
               <p>To induce them the more willingly to this mind, we
must let them see the 123 Articles in the 4<hi>th</hi> chap. of our
<hi>Constitutions,</hi> That by this means they may be informed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98227:28"/>
of the drift of this perfection, and may be weaned from
that fondness after their Relations. So that their whole
affections may be set upon the glory of God, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of their ghostly Father; who must therefore lay
home to them the great hazard of death worldly grief
carries along with it, which does constantly attend the
too great tenderness for near kindred.</p>
               <p>The escaping of this danger wholly proceeds from that
sincere resignation of themselves up into our hands: which
nevertheless was wrought by our importunity; A thing
all other Orders are strangers to; Then tell them of others,
who for this only act of resignation have obtained the
kingdome of heaven: and that they may one day be cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized,
if they will be diligent to prosecute so glorious a
design; promising them moreover under the Seal of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
that they shall be sure of our interest with the
Pope for the effecting of it.</p>
               <p>When therefore the Widows are ready to put their
Estates into our hands, and to give themselves up to the
directions of their ghostly Father; to avoid clamour and
opposition, they must immediately confirm this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance,
if they be willing, and that they are fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that such counsel comes from God, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
of Widows, who has greater care of their souls, than
bodies.</p>
               <p>They must be likewise possessed that God takes great
pleasure in good works and alms bestowed upon religious
Orders, and such poor people, as give themselves up to
devotion.</p>
               <p>And this advice their Confessour must give them, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them understand, that a cheerful giver is a delight
to God, when he acts within the bounds of obedience,
which is the sister of humility. But they must be sure,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98227:28"/>
when they determine any charity, to give an account to
their Confessour, that he may add, retrench or alter, as
he shall think fit.</p>
               <p>Above all, they must be forbid the visiting of other
Orders, lest they intice them away from us. For gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
this Sex is unconstant. They must therefore be made
see, that our Order is superiour to all the rest, more
necessary to the Church, of greater reputation in the
Cities, and has greater interest with Princes. So that it
will be impossible for them to make a better choice. For
the other Monks have none of these advantages: nor
ever look after the salvation of their Neighbours, being
generally ignorant, dull, heavy, sottish fellows, that mind
nothing but their bellies, and voluptuous living.</p>
               <p>When we have got good store of money and other
things out of our Widows, for fear they should take a
freak to marry again, we must put discreet Confessours
to them, who will take care that they assign us pensions,
and certain tributes, or alms, to help pay the yearly debts
contracted by our Colleges, and professed Houses, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
for those at <hi>Rome,</hi> and such Colleges where the
poorer sort of our Order study; as also for the re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
of Novitiates, who have long since been dispersed.</p>
               <p>Dispose them to lay out a good sum yearly for the
buying of Chasubles, Chalices, and other accommodations
for Altars.</p>
               <p>Before a Widow comes to die, if she has not left us to
be Executors, for fear of displeasing her friends, want
of affection, or any other cause, let her be acquainted with
our poverty, the number of our new Colleges not as yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed,
the zeal and numerousness of our Order, the great
want our Churches are in, and advise her to finish those
buildings of our Colleges which are left imperfect, and to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98227:29"/>
be at the charge her self, for the greater glory of God,
of erecting Temples, Refectories, and other foundations,
of which we poor servants of the Society of Jesus Christ
stand in need. And let all this be done warily and with
dispatch.</p>
               <p>After the same method must we treat Princes, and other
Benefactours, that have raised us any great structures, or
founded any Place. First, letting them understand, that
their good works are consecrated to eternity, that they are
the true model of piety, that they are those, we make a
particular remembrance of, and that they shall have their
reward in the next world.</p>
               <p>But if they object to us, that Jesus Christ was laid in a
manger at his Birth, and that he had not where to lay his
Head; and therefore that we who are in a more particular
manner his Companions, ought not to enjoy the perishable
vanities of this world: then must it be pressed home to
them, that indeed at the beginning, the Church was in
that condition, but that now by divine providence she
is become a Monarch; she was then but a broken rejected
stone, but is now grown into a high rock.</p>

               <p>THat the Mothers may the more willingly consent to
this enterprise, we must perswade them gently, that
they must be a little harsh with Daughters that are stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
whipping them with rods, if young; with mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and threats of worse usage, if more gone in years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:98227:29"/>They must be chastised, and denied what were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
befitting their quality. But if they will comply with
our Rules, they must be cherished with all tenderness,
and promised a greater portion, than if they should marry.</p>
               <p>The Mother must lay before them the austerity of a
Husband, and the chargeableness of that condition: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
to them the hardships and vexations of Marriage,
the torments and anguishes they are to endure, and that
nothing but sorrow is to be got by it; whereas the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into some religious Vow, brings along with it all
content. The same doctrine must be applyed to Sons that
are inclinable to marry.</p>
               <p>We must get familiar with their Sons, and invite them
to those Colleges we think fittest to place them in, carrying
them into our Gardens to walk, and to our Countrey-houses,
where we go for diversion.</p>
               <p>Shew them the great content those retreats afford, and
how great respect all Princes pay us. In short, we must
make it our business to draw in the youth, by carrying
them to our Refectories and Chambers, letting them see
the agreeableness of our conversation, and how easy our
Rule is, which has the promise of the glory of the blessed.</p>
               <p>Our sharpness in disputations of Things appertaining to
this world, or that to come, the eloquent discourses that
are made amongst us, from delightful entertainments so
heavenly pleasant, which seem to be bestowed upon us
in the name of the holy Virgin, by way of revelation,
must not be omitted, as so many inducements to bring
them to our Order: convincing them how great a sin it is
to resist a call from heaven. Let them likewise be present
at our Exercises, to see what that will do.</p>
               <p>The Preceptors that teach Widows Sons in the house
must be of our preferring; who must be perpetually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98227:30"/>
them over to us, and promise them, rather than
fail, that if they will enter into our Society, they shall be
received <hi>gratis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We must order it so, that their Mothers disappoint
them of their necessaries from time to time, to make them
consider into what troubles, and difficulties their affairs
are fallen.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">How to encrease the Revenues of our Colleges.</head>
               <p>NOne of our Order shall be admitted to the last pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession;
so long as they are in expectation of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
to befall them: unless he has a Brother amongst
us younger, and more likely to live than himself, or for
some other beneficial reason. In the first place, above all
things we must endeavour the aggrandizing of our Order
according to the will of our Superiours, who alone must
be acquainted with these things, and must do their utmost
to advance the Church of God to the highest sphere, for
his greater glory. To which end, the Confessours of
Princes and rich Widows, must be sure to tell them, that
since they receive at our hands spiritual good, for the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of their souls; it is but reasonable, they should make
us partakers of their temporal good things.</p>
               <p>We must refuse nothing that is offered us. And if they
promise us any thing, it may be committed to writing, if
there be any danger of giving them distaste by over-hasty
importunity.</p>
               <p>We must prefer no Confessours to Princes, or others,
but such as are able and fit to prevail with them, and to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98227:30"/>
reprove them now and then for not being kind enough to
the Society. And therefore if any of them act not their
part, as they should do, let them be called back immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
and others sent in their room. For we have found
to our grief, that many times persons have died suddenly,
and by their Confessours neglect have left nothing of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
to our Church. And the reason was, for want of being
dexterous enough to make them sooner ours, whilest they
lived: which might easily have been done, had we
watched to have taken them in the humour, and not
waited any other opportunity.</p>
               <p>We must visit the Nobility and rich Widows, and sift
out with a Christian address, whether they will leave any
thing to our Churches, as well to get remission of their
own sins, as those of their Relations and Friends. After the
same manner must we handle Prelates, and others of their
Diocess, which will bring us in no small gain.</p>
               <p>Our Confessours must be sure to enquire of those that
come to Confession, their names and sir-names, allies and
friends, what they intend upon the hopes of any Succession,
how they resolve to bestow themselves, how many bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
sisters, or heirs they have, how old, what estate, of
what vocation, or breeding, and perswade them such an
information imports much to the cleering their conscience.
Then if there be any hopes of advantage, let them be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
for penance to Confess every week: that what was
omitted in the first weeks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Confession, may be made out in
the next. Thus when all is got out of a Penitent, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
must have notice, and resolve how he shall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
for the future.</p>
               <p>What has been spoken in the Concern of Widows, must
as well be executed upon rich and wealthy Merchants, that
are married, and have no heirs, and upon rich Virgins that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98227:31"/>
have an esteem for Us. For if we once get into their estates,
we shall soon make them ours. But we must by no means be
too forward in driving on such a design, lest we spoil all.</p>
               <p>To procure any mans good will, we must take our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
from his Conversation, and study to humour him in
his inclinations. And our Provincials must send discreet
persons to those places, where the people are rich, that a
good account may be given to the Superiours of a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
success.</p>
               <p>As soon as our people find they are got into their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
they must presently cry up their great bounty and
deserts: which the other poor begging Fryars, never
think of doing.</p>
               <p>Our Receivers must take an Inventory of all the Houses,
Gardens, Quarreys, Vineyards, Villages, and other Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments,
in and about the Town they reside in; and, if they
can, learn how we are beloved among the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Moreover, they must find out every man's Imployment
and Income, what Land he has, and what encumbrances
are upon his Estate. Which may be done easily by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
the discourse at several meetings, by way of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
at Visits, and by the assistance of our fast Friends.
So soon as ever a Confessour has discovered a man to be
very rich, and that there is hopes of working upon him;
he must immediately give notice.</p>
               <p>They must likewise inform themselves exactly of such,
as will part with any thing considerable, in exchange for
their sons, whom we have admitted into our Society.</p>
               <p>Enquire if any of those, that wish us well, have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to be Benefactors to our Colleges; or if they
have made any purchace, upon condition to return it to Us
after their Decease: Or what better advantage, we are
to expect from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:98227:31"/>Every body must be acquainted with our great necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Debts that swallow us up, and the continual great
Charge we are obliged to be at.</p>
               <p>When our Friends bestow any thing upon us, we must get
it to be upon this condition, that after a little time, we may
have power to incorporate it into the rest of our Demains.</p>
               <p>If any of our Women-friends, that are Widows, or
marryed, chance only to have Daughters, we must neatly
perswade them to put them into a Nunnery with some
small Portion, that the rest of the Inheritance may be ours.
So for Sons, when they have any; we must do all we can,
to get them into Our Society, by terrifying them first, and
bringing them under perfect obedience to their Parents.
Afterwards we must make them despise all things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and shew them the greater Duty of following Jesus
Christ, who calls them, than their Parents, if they regard
their souls. It will likewise be a sort of Sacrifice to Our
Order, to draw in one of the younger Children, unknown
to his Friends; whom we must take care presently to send
to some Novitiate, a great way off, having first given no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to the General.</p>
               <p>If a Widower, and Widow marry, that have Children
by their former Marriages, and likewise by the latter.
Those of the last Venter must first be sent into a Cloister,
and then the former will easily follow.</p>
               <p>If a Widow has sons and daughters, that will not be
induced to a Monastick Life; the Superiour must for the
first default, blame the Confessour, and put another in his
room, that may be more likely to bring the business about.
But if that fail; then must the good woman be perswaded
to make money of all that she has in her power; and give
it us, for the expiation of her own sins, and her husbands.</p>
               <p>When we meet with a Widow that has no Heirs, and is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98227:32"/>
wholly devoted to us, and gives her self up to prayers,
and is in possession of Land, or any other Estate: we must
perswade her to assign it over to our Colleges, and content
her self with some small yearly allowance from Us, that
she may have more leisure to serve God, and be quit of
the incumbrances of this World. Afterwards take off her
pension, and maintain her in Common with our selves, that
under pretence of mortification and poverty, she may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as one of our Domesticks. For we must bring her
thus to our Bent, lest some wicked Relation of hers should
take her off from so good a Work. Therefore it will be
very convenient to send her to some remote place to spend
the remainder of her days; telling her, that such a course
will be in the nature of an Hermitage, which is held the
most devout and commendable of all ways.</p>
               <p>That our Friends may be the more easily induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
our poverty, our Superiour must borrow of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyed
men, giving Bond before a Scrivener. Perchance,
when they lie a dying, they will send to the Scrivener, for
the good of their souls, to deliver us up the Bonds. And
a piece of paper is easier given up, than the counting over
a heap of money.</p>
               <p>For the same reason, we should take up all the money
we could of our Friends, though we put it out again:
that so being sensible of our great indigency, this may be
a more ready way to provoke them in compassion at the
hour of death, to leave us the whole, or a good share, for
the erecting some new College.</p>
               <p>We must not fail to be in Fee with the Physicians, that
they may recommend us to their Patients upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>Our Confessours must be sure not to neglect visiting the
sick, especially those that are in despair, laying before them
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98227:32"/>
the pains of Purgatory, and Hell, which are no ways to be
avoided without Charity. They which have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
covetous are used for the most part to be very
liberal to our Society: and, it may be, put all their Estates
presently into our hands; which our people must press,
as much as they can, for fear the opportunity should slip
by.</p>
               <p>If a Woman in Confession, blames the vitious and harsh
humour of her Husband, that hinders her from observing
our Discipline, and that she be rich, and well inclined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us: She must be convinced, that she can do nothing
more pleasing to God, than to lay out a good Sum of Money
unknown to her Husband, or else spare it out of her own
allowance, as being the only means to procure her quiet
for the future, and remission both of her, owns sins, and
her Husbands. And we find many times by experience,
that this course has abated much of the Husband's ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</p>

most in their Chambers, let it be taken away; that being

Fellows.</p>
               <p>They which scruple the procuring any manner of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage

well born, and rich. To intice them, they must be
carryed into our Gardens, or into our best appartments,
by the Prefect of the Classes, who shall satisfie them, how
acceptable an undertaking it is to God their coming into

with them, to let them see what an affection we have for
them; which to manifest the more, when any others
chance to be in the same fault with them, we will pardon
them meerly for their sakes, and then let them privately
understand as much.</p>
               <p>We must tell them with some seeming kind of passion,
that Youth is always ill-disposed: and if they render not
up themselves upon such warning, they must be threatened
with eternal Damnation.</p>
               <p>For the more easie winning upon them, we must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
them with some small trifles, little Images, Books, or
the like; walk with them in the Gardens, and there give
them some of the best Fruit, sweeten them up with good
words, place them in the best seats upon any publick
Solemnity, and sometimes entertain them in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectories,

for us, and that we are most assured of it, by the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

               <p>When they come to desire to be admitted, it must not
be granted them presently, but put off a little, to try the
strength of their resolution.</p>
               <p>They must be advised to conceal their intention, not
to let their Relations know any thing of it, nor so much
as their Play-fellows at school. All this while we must
cherish their good purpose, of coming into our Society,
with the best words we can give them. So that by heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening
their desire every day more and more, they may
covet their admission with more pleasure and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But, if it so fall out, that any change their mind;
and would go out again: they must be remembred, why
they sought this admission with so much zeal and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and made know, that this inconstancy will turn to

if we have them in their own Countrey: therefore

with any such Design, as entring into our SOCIETY<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they ought to be admitted without any farther Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>

keeping, to some Novitiate, where the Governour of
the place is our Friend; lest the insolency of the people
should prevail against us.</p>
               <p>Now, to reconcile the Friends and Relations of these
Young-men we have admitted: we must extoll the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of their resolution, particularly in that they have
put themselves into the number of the faithful Servants
of Jesus Christ, without any leave of Parents, and that
the whole drift of our Order is to live in all Holiness,
and good Doctrine, to the admiration of all men. And
therefore Great Princes have been pleased to do us that
honour, as to enter into our Society, for a retirement there

               <p>Lastly, we must tell them, how acceptable so great a
Devotion is to God, when so young a man puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the List, to fight under the Banner of Jesus
Christ.</p>

               <p>OUr Confessours must have a great care, to use our
Nuns gently: because they are our greatest Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factrices
for the endowing our Colleges, and many
times give us half their Estates, when they enter into a
Monastery.</p>
               <p>We must get out of our Devout Women to vow
Chastity and Obedience in our presence, that we may be
sure of them.</p>
               <p>Let them know, how well God is pleased with their
vail and spiritual subjection, which comprehend Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98227:35"/>
and Obedience, and their voluntary poverty, which
argues their service to God, to be from the whole heart
and will. Thus into whatever good way we put them,
they will certainly recompence us with all their Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralties.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of reserved Cases and Dismissions from the
Society.</head>
               <p>BEsides the reserves in our Instructions, which our
Superiour, or an ordinary Confessour, with leave, has
power to dispense with: there is in the case of Sodomy,
Adultery, Fornication, a Rape, or any other unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or any thing committed against the honour, or
profit of the Society, a private order to let such know,
that their offence amounts to a Dismission, which can
have no pardon without first promising out of Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the Superiour all the particulars of their enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
               <p>No Confessour shall accuse a Penitent once Dismissed,
and out of Confession. But if any such acknowledge
his fault freely, let him be turned out: and if he will not
own it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he must be kept up for some time.</p>
               <p>When any of our Confessours take the Confession of
an Extern, and that they accuse themselves, for having
been dishonest with one of our Society: let them have
no absolution, before they have first acknowledged their
fault out of Confession. Which if they do, let ours be well
chastised, and give the others absolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:98227:36"/>If a Woman that is a stranger to us, has committed
simple Fornication, and confesses that she has been naught
with some of us: let her not have absolution before she
has sworn never to reveal what has been done, and that
upon receiving absolution, she shall declare with whom
she committed this folly.</p>
               <p>When two of our own people have committed Sodomy
one with the other: he that disowns it, shall be turned out,
and he that first confesses it, shall be kept in. But with
such mortification, as shall make him afraid ever to do
the like again: and presently after, whether willing or no,
let him be dismissed.</p>
               <p>Such as are lewdly given amongst us, whether in word
or deed, we must avoid; and having first acquainted the
General with our reasons, let us use them with all seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
deny them whatsoever they desire, be it never so
inconsiderable, and appoint such over them as shall never
let them lead a happy hour, put them upon all the meanest
Offices: till they begin to murmur, that we may have
occasion to set them Going. And be sure, we never suffer
such to stay with us, as rebel against their Superious, or
that can never agree with their Companions.</p>
               <p>But chiefly if any seem to be dissatisfied with their
Superiours, for making unjust acquisitions for our
Society, cross our interest, diswade people from being
charitable to us, or do not set themselves against those,
that bear us an ill will: they must never be suffered.
For, we must take this for a rule, that if any scorn their
obedience to their Superiours, and presume to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by their own fancies: they will have as little regard
for Christ's own commands.</p>
               <p>It is sufficient cause of Dismission to commend, or have
any esteem for a State or University, that is enemy to our
Society.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:98227:36"/>At the Dismission of any one, he must be more severely,
and sharply reproved, and have it laid home to him,
what a fault he has committed in forgetting his Duty.</p>
               <p>He that shall be appointed at dinner, shall lay open the
crimes of such heinous offenders, so as they themselves may
be convinced of their errour, and sensible of our just
resentment. But we must never think of keeping such
fellows. For they can only serve to bring a Scandal, and
breed Dissention among us.</p>

               <p>SUch as have the care not only of our spiritual affairs,
but temporal also, for the improvement of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
as the Confessours of great Princes and rich Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
our Preachers and Directors of these private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,

               <p>When the Confessour of a rich Widow is grown old,
let him be changed for one that may be more proper for
the place. But in the mean time, let the good old man
that has done us so much Service, have whatever he shall
demand, either for meat, clothing, fire, or any thing else
that his age may require. The Superiours shall not vex
him with penance, nor take much notice of his faults, for
the profits sake, and good harvest he has brought into the
Society by his industry, and well disposing of Souls. And
as to their Servants and Under-waiters, Bedels and others,
they must not be roughly handled, lest their decrepit age
become more chargeable to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:98227:37"/>It would not be handsome for us to send away the old
knaves that have taken so much pains in our behalf, for
faults, which the infirmity of old age makes them liable
to. Their Relations, that wish both them and us well,
would never forgive us.</p>
               <p>All incouragement must be given to our young Jesuites
that are noble and rich, and bring us in, Benefactours and
Founders: they must have all they can desire.</p>
               <p>We must be kind to those that have not yet given their
estates to us, and that expect large inheritances; and not
forget those that have been instrumental in drawing in such
youths, or have any way shewed their affection to our
Society.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Devotion of the Society.</head>
               <p>VVE must all of us take up this opinion, that the
Rule of our Society is much more excellent,
than that of other Orders, and therefore particularly press
this to all our friends, that they follow the Doctrine of
our Fathers, and that our Society is that foretold by
<hi>Vincentius Ferrerius,</hi> as has been proved out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
by Abbat <hi>Ioachin,</hi> our whole design being to
pursue the prescription of the Son of God, Jesus Christ
Crucified, and that it is our business to avoid giving any
Scandal in the least, so that we are the paterns of all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and are they that make learning flourish, and
give education to most people of quality.</p>
               <p>For it is our sense, that whosoever shall do or say the
contrary must not stay with us: Because a Kingdom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98227:37"/>
against it self must needs fall. And therefore we
are the more zealous in keeping up these Principles by
which we expect to prosper.</p>
               <p>Our people must be sure to take all occasions of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
that it is impossible the Church should flourish under
any Monarchy without the concurrence of the Temporal
power: that by this means we may win upon the Great
Ones, ever making appearance of living after the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
rules of any upon the place we are. This shall be
sure, not only to make us welcome to Princes, but
procure us a reputation of Wisdom, which in time will
bring us into their most secret Counsels. Where though
we serve the Society, all must be pretended for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
good, which will advance our Credit.</p>
               <p>Above all things we must still lay before us the glory of
God, and good of our Society. Following the proverb,
that bids us love our selves in the first place, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our neighbours.</p>
               <p>Therefore no matter what mischief we create; since the
advance of our Society is above all other considerations.
For we see by experience, what a help the Dissention of
Princes is to us, as likewise their ordinary follies and
weaknesses.</p>
               <p>But we must be cautious not to be suspected as the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters
of War, or to meddle in State-affairs: though we
avoid no means to serve our Society.</p>
               <p>When we are got into good credit: We must teach,
that learning is needless in a Parish-Priest, being only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for Regulars, that write controversies: and that
if they understand the Gospel, it is sufficient: Thus shall
we at last make them beholding to us for Doctrine.</p>
               <p>So soon as our reputation is got to the height, and that
we are well advanced in Riches, Learning and the favour
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98227:38"/>
of Great Men: Then is our time to enter upon Canonical
Cures and Abbies. Which other Orders are never able to
attain to, for want of parts, and discretion.</p>
               <p>Thus we may be in hopes one day to govern the whole
Church; which would be our golden age, and is a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
we may expect from God, as Protectour of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
in a more peculiar manner.</p>
               <p>For we have so ordered it; that for the time to come,
if we look well about us, nothing can fall out but peace
and tranquility: Since our Society has taken Jesus Christ
for its Shepheard, who will not fail to make it flourish in all
respects.</p>

               <p>THat we may not seem too greedy after gain, it will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
do well to omit taking up the lesser alms, that
are given to discharge our ordinary expenses: though on
the other side, we must not refuse the least thing that is
profered us by our good friends. But when we are
in pursuit of a great sum, we must now and then let slip
a less.</p>
               <p>There shall be no Monuments or Epitaphs set up in our
Churches, though it were for any of our best friends;
lest the number of them should make people mistrust
how rich we are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—Nay we must not permit it so much
as to a Widow, that we have drained to the last Mite.</p>
               <p>Our Society being made up of choice persons; if any
of them grow Scrupulous, and effeminate in their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
let them be dismissed. Also, he that conceals any
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98227:38"/>
thing from us, or that is dull, or sickly, or becomes mad
by over-studying himself, though he has given us all he
had: we must not give him a farthing back again. But
to make his Dismission the more Plausible, we must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to keep what he brought to us for defraying the
great charge we have been at with him.</p>
               <p>Those that are rich we must avoid being rude with in
the least: but send them away quietly, as out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
and great kindness. For by this means, when they
die, they may leave us all they have. Therefore we
ought to cherish their devotion, and if they seem inclined
to a Monastick life, advise them to make choice of St.
<hi>Francis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for such as are very rich and nobly born, we must
not dismiss them for any fault whatsoever: For it is an
easy matter within our own Walls to conceal their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages.
And therefore we must do it, for fear their
wealthy Relations should take it ill, if we handle them so
rudely.</p>

               <p>THe Superiours must keep these Instructions very pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
and look upon them, as the true directions they
are to observe: Nor may they impart them but to very
few of us, and those such as have occasion to make use of
them.</p>
               <p>Now, forasmuch as the greater part of our Order, that
have made the last vow, is acquainted with these Private
Instructions: Therefore the Society has provided, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98227:39"/>
none that are capacitated to know these things, shall have
it in their power, to enter into any other Order but the
<hi>Chartreux,</hi> whose austerity, and perpetual silence will
keep them safe enough.</p>
               <p>We must be very careful they fall not into the hands of
our enemies, who may make an ill interpretation of them.
But if it should happen, which God forbid; we must
absolutely renounce them, and deny that ever our Society
so much as dreamed of them. And therefore in their
stead we must produce our general Rule, that is in Print,
and which is quite contrary to these Private Instructions:</p>
               <p>Our Superiours must be very inquisitive to find out,
whether any of our people have given a Copy of them
to an extern.</p>
               <p>No Superiour shall have them transcribed without leave
from the General: And if the Society find that any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
has been backward in executing these private
Instructions; let him be sent straight to the <hi>Chartreux.</hi>
