            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as thou didst inspire in my deare loue <hi>Oger,</hi> his princely

she saluted him, and sayd, Graue wise man (for so thy white

the will of some almighty willer, one of the thrée goates left
the hermit, and came to the Lady, making not bestiall, but
rather diuine signes, that she would suckle thinfant: which
the Fairy ouerioyd to behold, thanked God, and kissing the
babe, laid it on the ground, and the goat placed hirselfe néere

of Milan in Lumbardy, who was triumphant faire, for faire

Wherefore sweet loue and onely companion of my bed, be

So the Fairie and <hi>Meruine</hi> remained in the house of that

giue testimony of her hugest torment: notwithstanding,
when louelinesse drew her selfe from her selfe, only to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
then would she sommon her conceits, and muster vp
whole armies of cogitations, to think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confirme, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the beauties of her <hi>Meruine,</hi> and to euery conclusiue
argument, swore by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he only should be her loue:
yet had she no sooner decreed that excellent iudgement, but
when she remembred him to be the son of <hi>Barbin</hi> the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
then found she contrary motions, auowing faultines
in her election. But loue, who is as reasonlesse as he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit,
drew her from those doubts, and only taught her thus,
I wil, because I must. Then was her loue such &amp; so great,
that for the space of tenne dayes she left the vse of meate or
drinke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and found no ease but in the sight of <hi>Meruine,</hi> so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
was her frensie, and so impatient her desire, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Meruine,</hi> who all the while had not one thought of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
her, or of her passion: only when he perceiued her ernest
regard of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he being full of princely curtesie, would hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
salute her. All which salutations were torments to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
her paine and woes that held her wounds more open:
for why, she durst not discouer that, which all her wits could
hardly couer, no though in it she had beene assured of a safe
recouerie.</p>
                     <p>3 Thus remained she the space of fiue yeres: in thend
whereof came an ambassadour to <hi>Montment,</hi> who ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

mightie King <hi>Mermont</hi> accompanied with his Queene,
his princely daughter <hi>Berea,</hi> and many of his priuate Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
before whome prostrate on his knees he fell and said:

the mightie <hi>Baucamont</hi> King of Damas, who by mee
wisheth thee health, and thine owne wishes, regreeting thy

heard the speech of the embassadour, hee stoode amazed to
thinke what businesse <hi>Baucamont</hi> should haue with him:
but taking the letter, and breaking opne the seale, he read
the tenure thereof, which instantly sent a displeasing sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

when he sendeth no greater a peere of his countrey then thy

of the pride with which his heart is furnished; say so to
him, for if thou so saist it not, &amp; what besides else I haue said,
by Mahomet in despite or thy King, I will make thy head

King, answered the messenger (whose feare-shaken heart
made all his body tremble) be well assured I will deliuer
all that you haue spoken, or what else your maiestie shall
please to commaund me. Be gone then (quoth the King)
and bid thy maister seeke him a wife in some other climate:
for <hi>Berea</hi> soareth higher then the sunne hath power to carry
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12928:14"/>
his eielight. Thus parted the messenger, on whom no rest
either by night or day dared to aduenture till he came before
<hi>Baucamont</hi> his Lord and Soueraigne, to whom he saide:
By <hi>Apollo,</hi> great King of Damas and my liege Lorde, in
vaine is thy care to entertaine loue, when thou hast lost
<hi>Berea,</hi> whose eies onely create loue: in briefe, her must
thou neuer enioy, for so her father hath sworne, nor I in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
of thée mine eares, vnlesse I tell thée that so he hath
sworne. More would not <hi>Baucamont</hi> endure to heare, but
all inraged with fury, swore by Mahomet, Alcheron, and the
shrine of Meca, hée would enioy <hi>Berea,</hi> yea though shée
were the sole paramor to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> or garded with an Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean
army: all which to performe, hee instantly sent foorth
summons to muster all his people, and to commaund all
his tributaries to serue him, protesting with force of armes
to finde that ioy which by force of words he could not enioy.
But only to desteny are the decrées of heauen knowen, for
he erred in his conceits, sith into the world was borne a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
excellent enough to defend <hi>Berea,</hi> I meane rarely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
<hi>Meruine</hi> the sonne of <hi>Oger,</hi> supposed the sonne

more in minde, most in beauty. <hi>Barbin</hi> who tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him excéedingly, shewed him the trade of marchandise,
and how to exchange for the greatest profite: but the bent of
his mind was contrary to that course, for his minde wholly
was addicted to ride horses, tosse pikes, plant battels, and
other feates of famous chiualrie, to which a while
we will leaue him, and will speake of

                        </gap> whome
spurres were not spared till he came to the tilt-yard. When
the Lady virgin <hi>Berea,</hi> who was enuironed with her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the other Ladies beheld the gallant yong <hi>Meruine</hi>
enter into the listes, her heart daunced in her cristall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
as if not there, but in him was her onely paradise.
Wo alas she loued him dearely, who neglected her wholly,
and often whispered to her soule, so Mahomet would, I
would <hi>Meruine,</hi> to whom onely I am a prisoner, whose
beautie onely hath surprised mine affection, were the sonne

other then himselfe no goddesse would wish for: for pouerty
with him is richer then the pallace of the greatest Emperor

threatned the element; at length a pagan fierce and strong
ranne with his launce in his rest against <hi>Clarissa,</hi> to whom
he gaue such an vnkind blow, that had not yoong <hi>Meruine</hi>
bin, he had tumbled to the ground: but the princely youthes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:12928:15"/>
vertue sustained him, yet so heauy was the incounter, that
<hi>Clarissa</hi> as much or more scared than wounded, returned to
his lodging, where being disarmed, hee laied that heauie
complaint on Fortune which iustly should haue bin intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to his owne weakens. <hi>Meruine</hi> seeing him disarmed,
his heart tickled, and his blood fiered with an emulation of
honour, which set an insatiate longing on his thoughts to
giue some blowes and to prooue his bodie: wherefore hee
fell vppon his knées to <hi>Clarissa</hi> and saide, I beséech you
faire prince, for the honor of Mahomet, bestow your armes
vpon me, to the end I may goe to the triumph, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue

if I can incounter him whose proud arme hatgh dained you
this indignitie, to do mine vttermost indeuour, to humble
him a low or lower then the earth. After <hi>Clarissa</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment
had heard the yong princes desire, he willingly
accorded to his wish: yet so, that <hi>Meruine</hi> should not accuse
him: but when the Iusts were ended, if Fortune made
him conquerour, he should leaue the honour, not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but to <hi>Clarissa. Meruine</hi> to all most willingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed,
saying further: Beléeue mée prince, I will do my
best to gaine the wealthy cup of the King, which also you
shall haue for my desire is knowledge, no honour. At this
<hi>Clarissa</hi> commaunded his chamberlaine to arme <hi>Meruine</hi>
with his owne armes, which hée so secretly did, that the
squiers of <hi>Clarissa</hi> knew it not. When he was armed,
they brought him a most puissant and fierce courser, on
which he mounted, and so departed, attended on by many
squiers, who fully imagined him to be their Lord <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rissa,</hi>
who slept in his chamber like a dromedary with his
cowardise. <hi>Meruine,</hi> whose spurres were Honour, and
Desire, rode so speedily that in the end hee entred the lists,
where valiantly hée meant to winne or conquere his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:12928:16"/>
2 In the end charging his launce, he ran like a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind
against him who had hurt <hi>Clarissa:</hi> to whom he gaue
a requitall blow, with such puissance, that he cast horse and
man to the ground, so furiously, as for fiftéene dayes after
he lay without motion. Then another Pagan of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort,
turned towardes <hi>Meruine,</hi> on whom he brake his
<hi>launce:</hi> but <hi>Meruine,</hi> who tooke pleasure in that martiall
excercise, behaued himselfe with such vertue, that with the
trunchion which remained in his hand, hée gaue him such a
counterbuffe, that breaking his heart in his bosome, the
Pagan died instantly in the place. What shall I néede to
make a tedious discourse of a hastie conflict? In briefe,
<hi>Meruine</hi> so couragiously behaued himselfe, that ere his
thoughts could bée capable of rest, with his broken launce
he threw tenne to the ground, of which not one euer rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
to the wondrous amazement of all the beholders.
Then began the crie of the multitude, to exalt him, thinking
it had bin <hi>Clarissa,</hi> euery one exclaiming aloude, <hi>Clarissa</hi> of
Affrike is he who ought onely to be estéemed. At this excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
a Pagan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on whose helme all the day before. Honour
sate twining her golden tresses, now enuious that <hi>Clarissa</hi>
had courted his mistresse, swore by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he should
neuer enioy her fauour: and forthwith pricked towardes
<hi>Meruine,</hi> who had newly recouered a launce from one of
his squires, and turning his horse, either incountred other
with such a violent incounter, that their staues flying into
small pieces, straue which piece should first flie into heauen
to report neuer like séene vigour. But for all the Pagans
force, it was impossible to mooue <hi>Meruine</hi> in his saddle,
who sate like a tower against a tempest, or a rocke against
the rage of the seas furie. But <hi>Meruins</hi> assault of a cleane
contrary nature, lift the Pagan vppe into the aire with his
launce, and thence let him fall with such violence, that he
brake his right arme: and yet <hi>Meruine</hi> brake not his staffe,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12928:16"/>
but with the same ouerthrew foure more dead to the ground.
At this began a greater crie amongst the knights, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
saying: <hi>Clarissa</hi> of Affrike is onely inuincible, and
Conquest herselfe is to him a handmaid. Then the king cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a retreat, and the triumphes to cease, for so a king intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
and euery one departed to his pauilion, and <hi>Meruine</hi>
to his fathers house, with the squires of <hi>Clarissa:</hi> in whom
ioy shewed the excéedingnesse of ioy, because their lord had
gained the honour of the day. But <hi>Meruine</hi> made great
haste to come to the chamber, which he ascended in all secret
maner, for he had an excéeding great care that <hi>Barbin</hi> should
not know any thing. When hée was come there <hi>Clarissa</hi>
lay solely accompanied with the chamberlaine, who before
had deliuered to <hi>Clarissa</hi> all what <hi>Meruine</hi> had done, he
tooke him kindely about the necke, and kissing him, sayde:
Mine honours crowne, and my liues garland, liue euer in
this circle of mine armes, as thou shalt euer be in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of my heart: for by thée am I renowmed in the court

Pagan prouinces. Many other spéeches he vsed of kindnes,
all which <hi>Meruine</hi> either excused or requited. To stand
longer on accomplements, were tedious, and tediousnesse
wearinesse: therefore in a word, all the honour of the thrée
dayes triumphes, and the cup of golde, the reward of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
were by the valour of <hi>Meruine,</hi> giuen to <hi>Clarissa,</hi> as
most wise, &amp; most valiant. And he was receiued by the king
<hi>Mermont,</hi> to beare in battell, if any assailed him, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
banner of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> So had vnknowen resolution ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
well knowen cowardise: and though <hi>Meruine,</hi> in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was more carefull then in secret kéeping this secret,
yet the most excellent virgin <hi>Berea</hi> afterwards attained the
knowledge thereof by <hi>Clarissas</hi> chamberlaine, which alter

dearely beloued of all men) and sayd, if <hi>Mahomet</hi> would
but grant them safe conduct, they doubted not, but now to
attaine the full perfection of wealth. Then they departed,
<hi>Meruine,</hi> his brother <hi>Tyrus,</hi> and the good marchant <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
to whom <hi>Barbin</hi> committed his children: for he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowed
to them his best endeuours: and at length came to
the port, where being imbarkt, they found the windes so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to their course, that in short space, they all arriued
at the port of <hi>Brandis,</hi> and went to lodge at the signe of the
Harts horne, where <hi>Iacob</hi> was accustomed to inne: and
found the hostesse sitting sadde and alone at the doore, whom
<hi>Iacob</hi> saluted, and inquired if hée might there be lodged.
The hostesse, whose name was <hi>Minea,</hi> answered: you may,
and then sighed: for great was the inward trouble of her
heart. Then the tables being couered, they fate downe: and
the hostesse with regardfull eyes beheld <hi>Meruine,</hi> rarely

<hi>Brohars</hi> found <hi>Croisant,</hi> who did entertaine him as kindly

Thus the false thinking traitour departed and left <hi>

Croisant</hi> and his wife, who when the houre of bed-time
came, betooke them to their rest, thinking of nothing lesse
than that which they neuer knew, to wit, euill. <hi>Basina</hi> at
that instant was great with childe of a sonne, who in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
highly exalted the Christian faith. <hi>Brison,</hi> in whom
treason had taken root, and now beganne to blossome, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his masters directions, was so close hid in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents
chamber, that the cunningest searching eie could
neuer perceiue him: euery minute protesting to himselfe to
accomplish the treason, for which he aduentured. Anon, the
night, as halfe ashamed to beholde such intollerable shame,
whippt her misty waggon with such haste thorow the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
that in the eies of all creatures she had lost hir prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence,
and yet had day in the skie no preregatiue: so as
of waking eies it was then called twy-light. In this fatall
houre arose <hi>Brohars,</hi> and comming to the pallace of <hi>Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,</hi>
sent a squire to tell him he stayed for him: at which
first sommons, by the help of the same squire, <hi>Croisant</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
himselfe, and so departed without disturbing <hi>Basina,</hi>
who as then slept soundly, for her innocency kept hir from
care-taking. Scarcely was the good <hi>Croisant</hi> without the
limits of the Chamber, but <hi>Brison</hi> the varlet of <hi>Brohars,</hi>
profaning so holy a receptacle, entred into the bed, and lay
by <hi>Basina.</hi> By this was <hi>Croisant</hi> and his false fairs-séem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
friend mounted vpon their horses, and gotten without
the walls of the city, when <hi>Brohars</hi> thus began to discourse:
Long time is it since (my déerest second selfe) I made th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

disloyalty of thy wife apparant to thy weake vnretaining
eares, yet armed with flinty dulnesse, thou hast denied thy
heart leaue to belieue me: and now therefore, if thou wilt

inseparable loue and holie marriage rites of our long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
friendship, I will aduise thée, like him that is the
purest part of my being. Yesterday when the declining of
the Sunne made the day deny to be day, as if glory were
gained in being adopted the euening, <hi>Brison</hi> my seruant
reported to me, that he had enioyed the excellencies of thy
excellent wife, this two yéeres and better: which shamefull
report of a villaine, so galled me, that drawing my rapier
the traitour hardly with life escaped: yet seeing him by flight
repriued, I thought it in some measure my duetie, to let
thée know so high a scandall, both that thou mightest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
and regard it. And by <hi>Mahomet</hi> he reported further,
that the false woman concealed him many nights in a presse,
in thy withdrawing chamber, where the strength of my
imagination makes mée beléeue hée is at this present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
if thou wilt approoue, and we finde true, by <hi>Iupiter</hi> he dies,
had he the liues often thousand. Hard it is to say, whether
at this discourse Ielousie or Sorrowe tooke first holde on the
heart of <hi>Croisant,</hi> yet both so excéedingly tormented him,
that ledde by the furie of his passion, hee and <hi>Brohars</hi>
leauing their squires behinde them, returned backe to his
house, where entring secretly at a posterne gate, they light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a torch, and mounting into his bed chamber found <hi>Brison</hi>
layd by <hi>Basina</hi> whome enuious sleepe charmed against this
miserable aduenture. <hi>Brohars</hi> at the first sight drew his
rapier, and slew <hi>Brison</hi> in the bedde, ere almost any eie
would haue iudged hee had seene him in the bedde (a iust
reward for so vniust treacherie.) Then sayd <hi>Brohars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

by <hi>Iupiter,</hi> were she my sister, I would holde it treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

2 At these wordes, the no ill-thinking <hi>Basina</hi> awaked,
and with an amazed shamefastnesse, swéetly blushed to sée
her husband and <hi>Brohars</hi> so néere her bed: but when she saw
the sheetes not full so white as her cheekes exceede them in
blushing and perceiued them all stained with a warme goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
liuorie, then shee scricked out aloud, and asked, what
meant that prodigious token of tragedies? Ah strumpet,
false breaker of wedlocke, and woorse then both, (answered
<hi>Croisant</hi>) burnt shalt thou bee for the sinne wherein this
night I haue found thee: and then drawing his rapier, hee
drew the innocent ladie by the haires, who dead-slaine with
amazment, lay at his feete. Whilest, <hi>Brohars</hi> (euer damned
for this action) thus proudly insulted ouer her: <hi>Basina</hi>
(quoth he) many times haue I tolde thee I would manifest
thy sinne, yet wouldest thou not desist to sinne, but euermore
increase thy sinne with <hi>Brison</hi> my seruant, whom this night
I haue slaine in thy bed, amidst the paradise of his imbraces.
Traitour, sayd the lady (awakened with these words, as
with a cracke of thunder) falsly thou liest. Deare loue and
lord, all dearer then my soule, my <hi>Croisant,</hi> vouchsafe to
heare me. O for pittie couer thy shining weapon, and let my
words haue thorow thine eares a gentle passage. Neuer
haue I in my thought beene guiltie of that execrable treason
which he vniustly vrgeth, nor would I be, were I tormented
with woorse then fiers torture. All this my false imagined
shame, vilde traitour, thou hast vene authour of, because I
haue neglected thine owne monstrous desires, which (by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen)
deare husband, he hath more then this whole yeere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted.
Falser then falshood (sayd <hi>Croisant</hi>) too apparant
is thine euill: and then shaking his sword ouer her, like the
wing of a haggard faulcon ouer a surprised doue, he draw her
from her bed, and had there seuered her guiltlesse head from
her as guiltlesse bodie, had not <hi>Isea</hi> her gentlewoman come
foorth, who seeing her lord tyrannising our her poore inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

Lady cried so loud, that many barons which belonged
to <hi>Croisant,</hi> came forth, and repriued the Lady from the
hands of their then too cruell lord, saying: Alas my lord,
what will you doe against your excellent wife, whose ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
wisedome, and wise virtue, is to women an example,
and to men a iust admiration? Lords, said he, her ill is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the bounds of ill, and more than the degrée of ilnesse.
It is prooued, it is prooued: and then he repeated all that
<hi>Brohars</hi> had reported, and himselfe séene. Lords, said the
Lady, by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or what other god soeuer takes true
patronage of our soule, my inward thoughts are innocent
of this accusation. With that <hi>Isea,</hi> who (as ye haue read)
heard all what had before passed betwéene <hi>Brohars</hi> and the

By <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the god and patron of our country, my lady in
thought and deed is altogether giltlesse: and this treason,
false <hi>Brohars,</hi> is the inuention of thy braine, because shée
hath euer lothed thée and thy detestable desires. When the
lords heard <hi>Iseas</hi> constant affirmation, they chid their lord
for too rashly following his owne will: and bade him listen
to <hi>Isea,</hi> who protested the ladies most pure pure innocencie,
auerring withall, the appeale she made against <hi>Brohars.</hi>
Whereupon they told him, it was conuenient to vse adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

fierce, and couragious, and so excellent a man at armes, that
the world knew not a better, had not the shamefulnes of his

there wanted but thrée dayes of making the yeare accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished:
so that poore <hi>Minea</hi> became her owne tormentor,
because her sister <hi>Basina</hi> in all that space had not found one
that durst vndertake her quarrell: yet it hapned in supper
time, that <hi>Iacob</hi> troubled to sée her sorrow, desired one to

expell mindes melancholie: and she more to satisfie him,
than to please her selfe, came, and set herselfe next to <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine.</hi>
Then they demanded the cause of her griefe: to whom
she reported all the treason of <hi>Brohars,</hi> and how hir inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

if some diuine power vouchsafed her not a knight to defend

nothing else replied <hi>Meruine,</hi> so they retired backe the one
from the other, to take their course with more violence. The
Story saieth this incounter was on a goodly gréene plaine
before the Earles pallace, who as before I said, stood to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them, with him his wife, and a gallant young Prince
his sonne and heire apparant. When <hi>Meruine</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were seuerd more than the length of a good cariere, they
put spurres to their coursers, and cowching their launces,
ranne with such terrour, that the ground trembled at the
chidings of their horses hoofes: and when they ioyned in
the shocke, the Pagan shiuered his launce close to his gant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
yet no more stirred the princely <hi>Meruine</hi> then the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telest
breath of aire, the strongest pyramide in Egipt. But
<hi>Meruines</hi> incounter bore death in his launces point, for he
stroke his staffe more than a foot and a halfe thorow the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
body, and pursued it with such vigor, that he bore him
headlong downe dead vnto the ground: then stopping his
horse triumphantly, he said in himselfe: euen as he thus is
ouerthrowne, ouerthrew I all the knights which ranne
for the golden cup which <hi>Clarissaes</hi> imagined valour enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
What reason now can deny me knighthood? None
but will, and that will is vniust. Marchandise farewell,
henceforth will I traffike nothing but honour.</p>
                     <p>2 Thus said young <hi>Meruine,</hi> growne prowd of this
late ouerthrow: but when the Pagans, and the friends
of the Pagan which was slaine, saw him pay Natures last

and that in such sort, that hée slewe more then a third part of
them. Yet his foes Hydra-like increasing, by killing, had
mightily indangered him, if the other marchaunts and the

ranne and caught <hi>Meruine</hi> by the arme, crying, alas deare

Then went <hi>Minea</hi> towardes the Counte, and falling on

Then demaunded <hi>Meruine</hi> his helmet, which <hi>Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant</hi>

which euer should be adored. Now was <hi>Brohars</hi> (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

for valure; onely treason the impoisoner of vertue hauing

agenst him, for offring to haue forced <hi>Rabions</hi> wife the
son of <hi>Antifer.</hi> But that which giues <hi>Brohars</hi> the greatest

entred into his owne gates, where his wife with all obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances
of true duety, kindly entertained him, and <hi>Tyrus</hi>
the house of <hi>Barbin</hi> his father, who séeing him vnaccompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied

brother that he is vnreturned with thée, to make happy my
desires. Deare father, replied <hi>Tyrus,</hi> he is taken prisoner
at Brandis, which is a strong citie seated vpon the sea: Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,
said his father, tell me quickely for what cause? Sir,
said he, with a fearefull trembling, <hi>Meruine</hi> whom you
call my brother, is too fierce, proude, and of an ambitious
aspiring spirite, me hath he altogether neglected, and bent
his thoughts onely on impossible indeuours. The cause of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12928:34"/>
his imprisonment is, for that he hath slaine seuen renowned
knights at one instant with his sword. And from thence
<hi>Tirus</hi> discoursed to his father all the déeds of <hi>Meruine,</hi> his

to Brandis, his deliuering <hi>Basina,</hi> his being there surprised,
and lastly, his deliuery after six yeares imprisonment with
perpetuall banishment, till when there was no expecting his
returne. When <hi>Barbin</hi> with a grieuing ioy had heard
him recount all these famous exploits of <hi>Meruiue,</hi> he askt
<hi>Tyrus</hi> in all these dangers, what aid or help he had done for
<hi>Meruine:</hi> and <hi>Tyrus</hi> tolde him, not any at all. Then the
blood of anger started into the face of <hi>Barbin,</hi> and he said to
<hi>Tyrus,</hi> False Pagan boy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> recreant to trus nobilitie, whie
didst thou faile him who would haue failed life for thy loues
cause? Where was thy sleepy sword, that vnsheathing it,
thou didst not hazard to die in his rescue? By <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
deare father, said he, I dare not fight, my weapons are only
the words of an honest marchant: let <hi>Meruine,</hi> on whom
the goddesse of warre is inamoured, fight for vs both, whilst
I in a peacefull climate winne honor by my traffike. Thus
disputed <hi>Tyrus</hi> with his father, to whom Chiualry was
nothing beholding: but <hi>Barbin</hi> most sadly sorrowfull for
the troubles of <hi>Meruine,</hi> flung away with great
furie, making a solemne vow to <hi>Mahomet,</hi>

tooke leaue of the Lady, and came to the house of <hi>Barbin,</hi> to

with all spéed to go with me from the K. to Brandis, to fetch
your son <hi>Meruine</hi> home againe. <hi>Barbin,</hi> to whom no sound

for his home occasions they departed together in great hast,
whom on the seas sailing towards Brandis we will leaue,
and a while speake of king <hi>Baucamont,</hi> and thother pagan
princes, who after the late storme found so prosprous a gale,

him &amp; gaue him such a well wishing blowe, that if the pagan
had not spéedily turnd, he had neuer turnd more than the last
turne which turneth to life eternall: notwithstanding, the
blowe was sent from so willing a spirit of anger, that glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
downe, it disseuerd his hand from his arme, which when
<hi>Eclamard</hi> felt, he spurred his horse, and betooke his flight to
his tent, whilest the whole armie which then were sadly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted,
aduised him to returne and inclose <hi>Mermont,</hi>
which <hi>Sallames</hi> vnderstanding, foorthwith gaue counsell to
retrait, lest that a sodaine inclosure should defeit their gotten
happinesse, which they did most honorably, retiring pace by
pace to the towne, their faces still fixt on their enemies: but
in this retraite <hi>Mermont</hi> lost much, because <hi>Baucamont</hi> fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
excéeding close, yet neuerthelesse, the other side lost
much more, who returned to their tents discontented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
vnreuenged. Now was <hi>Mermont</hi> brought to his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
where his Quéene and daughter roially receiued him,
demaunding both his health and successe in battell, which he
reported in doubtfull maner, saying, both sides had lost, yet
assuring them that <hi>Baucamont</hi> should neuer liue to enioy
<hi>Berea:</hi> to which words <hi>Berea</hi> gaue humble thanks with
princely reuerence. Then demanded <hi>Berea</hi> what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

Many other discourses the king and his barons held, til
supper being serued, they sate downe: which no sooner finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

downe this immoueable iudgement, that <hi>Berea</hi> was most

that night indented with his new thoughts that they
should exile sléepe from his eyes, and make his rest the rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>4 But when <hi>Minea</hi> perceiued that <hi>Meruine</hi> must so

his owne country: the which he did, bringing with him to
Brandis foure hundred horsemen his attendants. When
the morning had set open the gates, through which the day
might passe, <hi>Meruine</hi> arose and desired his father &amp; the rest
to make haste in their departure: he longed excéedingly to

that could haue read on the table of his desires might haue
séene it was <hi>Berea</hi> to whom his wishes aspired. By this

that if his maiesty pleased to commaund him or his power

with triumph he returned to his castle, and <hi>Iacob, Barbin,

were (said he) the signes of christianity which he had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
to root from the face of all nations. Scarcely was his
last wordended, but the pagan mariners assaulted the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
whom <hi>Meruine</hi> &amp; the rest with their swords in their
fists, violently seconded, making almost the beginning and
ending one moment. There might the eie of man behold a
lamentable spectacle; for of xxx Christian soules in a trice
were xxvj. breathlesse, only iiij. suruiuing, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien
Drohes,</hi> and ij. others, which breathed scarse a breath,
before their breaths vanished but <hi>Drohes</hi> turning aloft his
stéelehewing sword (which the counte of Meulant had giuen
him, when he fought against <hi>Sodonas)</hi> slew an infinit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the valiantest Sarazens but <hi>Gallien</hi> caried himselfe
so couragiously that he neuer stroke blow with his axe, but
he disseuered the life from the body. When <hi>Croisant</hi> sawe
the prowesse of <hi>Gallien,</hi> he cried vnto his people, that they
should not for a world kil him, bicause he would present him
as a great estimate to king <hi>Mermont:</hi> but that word of lifes
safety cost him more by much than he desired to tender: for
<hi>Gallien</hi> smote so thicke with his axe, that the Pagans in
aboundance tumbled into the sea, <hi>Gallien</hi> still crying S.
<hi>George</hi> and me; and withall crying; Thou holy Lamb of
<hi>Iuda,</hi> comfort thy people. All this while the valiant acts of
<hi>Meruine</hi> the son of <hi>Oger</hi> did, were wonders beyond won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and more than words haue power to deliuer: yet what
he did, he ill did, sith it was to exalt <hi>Mahomet,</hi> &amp; shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

misbeliefe, but curse with immortall malediction, that false
fairy <hi>Gratiana,</hi> who stealing him, told not the trueth of his
birth and being. <hi>Gallien</hi> and <hi>Drohes</hi> made great resistance
against the Pagans, but the highest valure is profitlesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
an higher resolution. Wherefore cosin <hi>Drohes,</hi> said
<hi>Gallien,</hi> let me kisse thee, and bid thée farewell, for here shal

<hi>Gallien,</hi> whom <hi>Meruine</hi> beholding with the eies of perfite
anger, and séeing that none of his people durst approach
him, cried, retire thou valurelesse amated nation, whose ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

<hi>Gallien,</hi> he said, Traitor, all thy defences are but mists that

thy fault for such conquest and greatest now shall be thy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow:
Yet for thy valure sake, I will contradict my
iudgement, yield, and thy life is saued. Were it not for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
(said <hi>Gallien)</hi> I should hate thy soule, but thy body be
assured, I detest, yet my selfe much more, should I haue
but halfe a thought of submission: neuer was there pagan
borne, to whom I will be obedient: and at that word he
strucke a pagan that approched him with such furie, that he
fell dead before <hi>Mernin. Mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had not euen at that instant wrath thrust pittie
from her soueraignty, he had both saued and loued him, but
being blinded with emulation, he rusht vpon <hi>Gallien,</hi> and
strucke him vpon the head, that he claue him euen vnto the
girdle. Wo alas <hi>Gallien</hi> the sonne of <hi>Oliuer,</hi> as memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for his vertues, as famous for his victories, is now
slaine: forgiue him great <hi>Ioue</hi> that slew him, and yet it
was a wound that wounded all christendome.</p>
                     <p>2 Now is <hi>Drohes</hi> alone, and yet not alone, for séeing
<hi>Gallien</hi> dead, he was consorted with infinite perplexities,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12928:47"/>
and as twere armed with their inuisible tumults, he sware
that before he died, he would reuenge his death, then flew
he amongst the proudest Sarazins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sending infinites to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him whom he loued, but alas their courses were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
for <hi>Gallien</hi> ascending, they descended. So like a

did <hi>Drohes</hi> behaue himselfe, that leauing his own,
he boorded the ship where the Pagans were inhaused, and
there defended and offended with such vnspeakable corage,
that not any but started backe and refused to assaile him.
Iesus, said <hi>Drohes,</hi> that madest the crosse glorious by thy
passion, shall I, O must I die here, and thus vnreuenged,
with that word he leapt into a litle boate that was behind
at the st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

entred there, he would be his deaths man: for sithence he
was alone, he would sell his owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; his fellowes liues, at
the rate of a bloody tribute. Then came <hi>Meruin</hi> all amazed,
saying; Christian, for pure loue only of thy vertue, if thou
wilt yield, and trust mine honorable reputation, by <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
and him thou callest thy redéemer, thou shalt haue no

this do, and so do, otherwise by <hi>Alcaron,</hi> my honour and

swéet thunder of <hi>Meruins</hi> speach, albeit it made but a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
melody in his eares, yet entring into many souldierlike
considerations, both of after aduenture, and present dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
guided by the grace of God and his good Angell, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
a will to accept those conditions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saying to himselfe:
By that celestial virgin who bare the fruit of life, it is better
to be in prison, and prolong life with some hope, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
die, and the soule vnsatisfied. Then raising his voice
aloft; Noble pagan, qd he to <hi>Meruine,</hi> on these conditions,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:12928:48"/>
that neither my life be violated, nor I vrged to deny my reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
I yeeld my selfe, Christian qd <hi>Meruin</hi> I assure it thée:
then <hi>Drohes</hi> deliuerd vp his sword, and <hi>Meruine</hi> receiued
it. At the instant of this aduenture, there stood by a pagan,
who boiled to shew himselfe a notable varlet, and séeing
<hi>Drohes</hi> without armes, he smote him ouer the face, saying
Uillaine, thy death is sworne. With that <hi>Meruine</hi> turned
back, in whom rage by desert challenged an interest, bicause
both his faith and honour was profaned, saying to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
Thou son of a common vnsatisfied whore, proue why
thou smotest this Christian, who is yielded my prisoner, and
to whom by warranty my reputation is ingaged: with that
<hi>Meruine</hi> lifted vp <hi>Drohes</hi> sword being naked in his hand,
and stroke the Pagan, that he claue him to the teeth: then
amplifying his protestation, said, By <hi>Mahomet,</hi> if there be
any man, of what estate soeuer, that impeacheth my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
or doth my word wrong to any christian, this hand,
and this sword shall minister reuenge: for all my déeds shal
be iust and religious. O immortall creator (said <hi>Drohes</hi> to
himselfe) how well worthy is this Pagan to rule a monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie!
I haue not séene a creature more wise, gracious, nor
more valiant. O thou that disposest all things, dispose and
conuert his thoughts to christianity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so shal he be well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of all honours, otherwise my thoughts are prophets,
presaging an vnspeakeable losse to ensue by his chiualrie.
These praises whispered <hi>Drohes</hi> of <hi>Meruine,</hi> being but the
first sacrifices of a greater loue which ensued. Now came
<hi>Barbin</hi> to <hi>Meruine</hi> saying, My beloued sonne, too strong a
a witnes is this blow of thy heauy displeasure, I pray thée
of loue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giue not to thy followers matter of indignation, as
you haue done to him you haue slaine. Father qd <hi>Meruine,</hi>
dissimulation is a branch of cowardise, I will be plaine and
iust, if the greatest monarch vnder heauen wrong me, my
sword shall right me. Yea but (said <hi>Barbin)</hi> feare is fellow
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:12928:48"/>
with tyrannie &amp; souldiers must be preserued with affabilitie.
By <hi>Mahomet</hi> answered he againe, I will be feared through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the world, &amp; who so is not feared, is not truly beloued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of
whatsoeuer is gotten by the conquest of these christians, I
desire nothing part it amongst you, saue onely this prisoner:
wherefore let none doe him villanie, for it is mine indignitie.
This sayd: al the pagans trembled, till with a chéerefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
he gaue new life to their terror: such effects of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was in his beholding. Now all troubles being appeased,
the pagans diuided the bootie amongst them, and <hi>Meruine</hi>
withdrawing himselfe into his cabin, onely made himselfe
rich, with heaping to himselfe infinite wishes to behold and
enioy the most admirable <hi>Berea:</hi> and in these cogitations he
sayled with such prosperous successe, that in few dayes they
arriued at the port <hi>Luternia,</hi> where they landed, two leagues
from the host of king <hi>Baucamont,</hi> who as you haue heard,
had besiedged <hi>Mermont</hi> within <hi>Montment,</hi> with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand men, and had so continued fiue moneths, from
the time that <hi>Barbin</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> departed in quest for the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
valiant <hi>Meruine,</hi> whom they brought with 300. fighting
men, 400. they had at their departure from <hi>Brandis,</hi> but in
the conflict at sea, they lost 100. Now as they marched, it
was told <hi>Meruin</hi> that the next morning should a great bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
be fought betwéene the kings, wherefore <hi>Meruine</hi> sayd
vnto <hi>Iacob,</hi> I pray you let vs adde wings to our féete, that
we may flie to the beginning of the battel, for in it shal <hi>Berea</hi>
behold me either honoured or intombed. Thus, and in these
discourses, they shortned the tiresome way, passing by a little
cottage, and thence entred into a small village, but there they
found nothing to eate, for <hi>Baucamont</hi> had destroied al. Thus
will I leaue to speake of <hi>Meruine,</hi> and will returne
to <hi>Mermont,</hi> and his fortunes in the
next dayes mighty battell.</p>

the prize of the most excellent resolution, make her the aime

well ordered march, and pace for pace, in as orderly equipage
approched their enemies, who staied, for them ranged and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

the power of <hi>Mermont</hi> so well deraind and deuided, he
went from ranke to ranke, &amp; cheared his men with these spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
My Lordes and Barons, for the honour of your names

win <hi>Berea,</hi> or al be dissolued and in that hope set forward to

(as you haue before heard) and when <hi>Baucamont</hi> was
mounted, he caused a charge to be sounded: &amp; his foes on the

it was, to heare the reuiuing clamors, to sée the ioyning of the
hostes, to behold the shot of one and other side, in such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
that it seemed like a snow descending from heauen:
when the shot ceased, then began they to fight hand to hand,

downe, trailing their reines in contempt, after them that but
ere while ruled them. There might you sée a hand holding a

fought to keepe away death, now lamenting for nothing, but
that he could not haue death, all things confused, all things

                        <hi>Berea</hi> was at

                        </hi>
Thus armed, he mounted on <hi>Mordant,</hi> and pacing foorth,
found all his troupe ready attending his comming, and so in
warlike maner they all departed, but in their marching <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine</hi>

faith which so much thou holdest inuiolate, thou wilt this
day aide vs in the battell, to which we are marching, I will
both doe thée honour, command thee armes, and reuerence
thy reputation. In faith (replyed he) or what els thou canst
imagine I estéeme déerer, I will: neither doubt mee for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loialtie,
sith if all thine army should renounce thée, <hi>Drohes</hi>
would die faithfully by thee. At those wordes <hi>Meruine</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him armes; and when <hi>Drohes</hi> was armed, he made
a vow, that if that day he encountred the pagans, then the
Discipline and Iustice issuing from his sword, should te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie,
that the death of <hi>Gallien Rothorus</hi> should not sleepe
vnreuenged. Now had they ridden so farre, that by the giant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begotten

aire, they might see they were not farre from the battell: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none
they might heare the noise, the cries and the incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
all which assured their former imaginations.</p>
                     <p>2 Then pricking more eagerly forward, they hasted to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of his followers, taken prisoner: to whom <hi>Baucamont</hi>
with reuiling words, sayd, Uassale to my fortune, this day is
the last of thy lifes date, and thy death shall be shamefull, thy

lie with her but one sole night, for after I will bestow her on

and commanded him to conuey <hi>Mermont</hi> to his tent,
til he had vtterly discomfited the rest of his army. Then took
they <hi>Mermont</hi> and bound him with strong cords, and muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling

<hi>Meruin,</hi> as if awaked from a slumber, at such exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

He approaching so neare that the sound of his words might
be retained, he cried, <hi>Mermont</hi> my king, feare not thy ill

whom he said; Absolutely valiant Christian, I challenge
thée, make good the couenant betwixt vs, spare neither king
nor prince, commander nor follower: then spurred they two

before the shearers, so fell they before them. Then <hi>Meruin</hi>

said vnto him, famous king, and my loues soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
my work is but the work of duty, command my life

do, hereafter shall write mine allegeance: hold, lace on your

                     <p>4 With that he beheld <hi>Antifer,</hi> who was princely moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

horse, and theron mounted king <hi>Mermont,</hi> whose ioy none
can speake of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but those that haue tasted his affliction. Now
began a maruelous battell, wherein all did very well, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one couetous to do more: pleasant and louely it was
to behold <hi>Drohes,</hi> who thinking euery pagan he mette the
murderer of <hi>Gallien,</hi> sent thousands to hell, that had not
seen <hi>Gallien,</hi> but aboue all, <hi>Meruine</hi> surpassed, who neuer
lifted vp his hand, but death followed the falling. At these
two <hi>Mermont</hi> wondred, swearing within himselfe the one
was <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the other <hi>Apollo,</hi> and that they were come,
the one to shew deity, thother to attaine a greater conquest
than the death of <hi>Pithon.</hi> In fine he said, both were his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants,
bicause his quarrell was lawfull. In such sort did
<hi>Meruine</hi> and <hi>Drohes</hi> behaue themselues, that of 3000 that
caried away <hi>Mermont,</hi> not one escaped, but either slaine or
sore wounded. A Sarazen beholding this fight, séeing two

you shall sée them ascending from yonder valley, flie, flie, for

death is in their foreheads. Traitor said <hi>Baucamont,</hi> turn
thée and bring me to them. Not for the wealth of the world
answerd he againe, for by <hi>Iupiter</hi> I had rather mountaines
should fall vpon me, then the wrath of those inraged people
should by aduenture find me: and in this saying, he stroke

the méeting of two tempests from two seuerall corners of

he fel from his courser to the ground, neither had he euer rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

of such vehemencie take hold on me, as no creature can
imagine. Mahomet defend my father, for I feare some euil.
Thus dissembled she with her mother, <hi>Meruine</hi> being the
loadstarre by which all her lodgings were guided. All this
while fell destruction from the sword of <hi>Meruine</hi> vpon the
pagans who like larkes vnder the wings of a hobby, sought
holes in the earth to hide them. <hi>Drohes</hi> pursued his foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steppes,
and the nearest of any imitated his vertues. Now
was <hi>Baucamont</hi> remounted once more, and passing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
his ranks, gaue them new incoragement, reuiling the
new come strangers, and disabling their actions, though his
wounds bare bléeding witnes of their worths.</p>
                     <p>5 When he had done, he charged afresh vpon <hi>Mermont,</hi>
and that with such impregnable violence, as he ouerthrew
him horse and man to the ground, but with nimble agilitie,
he soone recouered his féete, and drawing his sword, brandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
it for his defence. All that shew of magnanimity had
but little auailed to his profit, if <hi>Meruin</hi> had not againe by
chance come to his rescue, who cried aloud, <hi>Mermont</hi> my
king, deferre thy fortune but a moment, and ile yield succor
to thy life: and then rushing amongst the thickest, he strake
<hi>Gyrion</hi> on the head, cleauing him to the waste. After him,
the next, and the next, sparing none that was within his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.
When <hi>Baucamont</hi> sawe death and destiny lie in
<hi>Meruins</hi> sword, like a man made desperat, bicause his estate
was desperate, he ioyned himselfe to <hi>Meruine,</hi> striking
so violent a blowe, as he claue insunder the crest of his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
but to his head did no harme but amazement. <hi>Meruin</hi>
displeased at his entertainement, drew <hi>Entrant</hi> his sword,
and without o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his puissance. The pagan king fearing the blow, retired alit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:
yet had hee neuer breathed anie more malice, if the
sword had not turned in the hand of <hi>Meruine,</hi> which like a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12928:53"/>
thunderbolt fell on the arme of <hi>Baucamont,</hi> and that in such
heauy maner, that the armor, shoulder, &amp; all, were cut asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
When <hi>Meruine</hi> saw him thus spoiled of his defender, in
iesting maner he sayd, king <hi>Baucamont,</hi> it is time now the
world excuse you from these martiall occurrents, sith the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
for you is a monasticall function: say hencefoorth for the
loue of <hi>Mahomet</hi> you will abiure your folly, hauing paied to

sayd, he returned to <hi>Mermont,</hi> &amp; remounted him the second

raised him from his prostracie, saying, no, but you are
deceiued, you are deceiued, I honor him &amp; you: and with that

said the king, but I pray thée, to what ende doest thou cite

Now <hi>Mermont</hi> looking vpon <hi>Drohes,</hi> asked <hi>Iacob</hi> what

                     <p>3 When this was done, the king called <hi>Meruine</hi> and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
him if he found no declining in his memory from that hie

perseuer in his beginning, and bear the glory of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>

is to make famous my religion, and the aime of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to proue my force greater than any christians: this I
loue, in this I liue and thus shall my life consummate. The
king hearing this, was very ioyfull: wherefore embracing
him in his armes, he said, Dearer than my kingdome, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine</hi>

magnanimity, and for thou didst twice restore me fro death
to my former being, I create thée the principal chamberlaine

these honors, were such as made glorious the giuer, yet the
receiuer seemed only glorified. Thus in great pomp <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine</hi>
continued in the kings house, beloued and feared of all
men, except of the traitor <hi>Marant,</hi> nephew to the king, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his sisters son, and espoused to <hi>Butor</hi> that gouernd Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,

and 500 expert souldiers, and with them priuily issued
out of the city, taking an vsuall path, through which he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
so long, till at length he perceiued where <hi>Baucamont</hi>
with his hoste returned from the chase, his arme as then

Now had <hi>Drohes</hi> incountred a giant-like pagan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with

smote him a blowe with such vigour, that he claue his head

<hi>Drohes</hi> recouered himselfe, and flourishing his sworde,
vowed vengeance for his iniurie. But <hi>Meruine</hi> séeing the
pagan by such dishonour had slaine the horse of <hi>Drohes,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented

they marched in souldier like manner to Montment. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

repeated the wrongs their vnlawfull armies had begotten
in his countries, threatning a requital for these indignities.
But <hi>Baucamont</hi> regardlesse of all mistrusting fortunes,
without any amazement in his countenance, made a petition
to <hi>Mermont,</hi> that all the twentie foure prisoners might be
deliuered, onely himselfe and <hi>Antifer</hi> detained for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
which if it would please him to vouchsafe them, would
restore him recompence for all the indmagements, they or
their warre had procured, and that their mightie armie as yet
not wholly vanquished, shuld returne to <hi>Damas.</hi> Upon these
Articles the king concluded, so the 24. were infranchised and
with them also the two imprisoned Ambassadors of <hi>Bauca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
to wit <hi>Morgant,</hi> &amp; <hi>Nygron,</hi> who as then had béene

whose ioy was the greatest of all ioy, to sée himselfe

basest vassall liuing by the graces of his fauour. The reason,
because as he was valiant, maiesticall, and inuincible: so was
he sweete, courteous, affable and pleasant in the eyes of all
creatures. Yet <hi>Marrant,</hi> in whose heart enuy had built her a

because no man else hated him. Thus being great with child

the thing whereof I complaine, is of that honor-deuouring
<hi>Meruine,</hi> whose pride if it take roote, and his life flourish,

departed, he to the king, and the band of 500 to the woods,
where they ambusht themselues in a couert, through whose
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12928:62"/>
thicknes, as yet the sunne had neuer pieped. Now earely in
the morning before <hi>Meruin</hi> went tattend the king on hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
he went to the chamber of lady <hi>Berea,</hi> who that night
dreamt a fearefull and strange dreame, which had not onely
put her sences in amazement, but drowned her heart in a
deluge of extreame sorrow, yet when she beheld <hi>Meruine</hi>
like a flame, she threw her selfe about his necke, heaping vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
infinit kisses infinit redoublings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> said: Ah <hi>Meruine</hi> my

for thée my heart dieth. This night I dreamed a dismall
dreame the solution whereof belongeth, I feare to thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
Me thought I had a most delicate and princely grey
hound, so swift, so nimble, so deliuer, that it was impossible
for Nature to conceiue how to forme such an other. This
greyhound me thought, went into a chamber, where were
many serpents, who with in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>enomed malice so inclosed
and assailed him on euery side, that it was impossible for him
any more to returne to my company: the griefe for his wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
made teares burst from mine eyes, and those teares inuited
fadder lamentations, that striuing to make knowen my
languor, I awakned with my sorrow: what this pretends,
I know not, only I beséech thée for the honor of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
that aboue all men thou beware of mine vnkind cosin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi>
for he is traiterous, and treachery hateth alwaies the
vertuous. Is it possible qd <hi>Meruine,</hi> that in <hi>Marants</hi> faire
countenance should lodge such distemperate malice? Ha my
one onely excellent loue (said she) trust him not, lookes are
liers, and his chéeks are a table of falshood. Madame replied
he, I trust none but my sword, and that in extreames shalbe
mine onely redéemer: what shall be shalbe, onely deare la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
I beseech you commaund some carefull attendance to be
giuen to my neuer-failing friend <hi>Drohes,</hi> who is fallen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly

gaue him assurance with many protestations, and so after
diuers kisses and imbraces, they departed either fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other.
But when <hi>Berea</hi> was alone, her sorrowes gaue a new on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
on her soule, and put all her hopes to slaughter, and that
not without good cause: for before her eies again shall giue
salutation to his forhead, his life and honor shalbe both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangerd,

<hi>Mermont</hi> with <hi>Baucamont, Antifer, Meruin, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
and other noble gallants, departed from Montment,
and came to the forest, where they had kingly pastime, and
killed many wild beasts, continuing their sports iij. dayes
without thought of returning: all which space, an espiall of
<hi>Marrants</hi> attended foot, by foot vpon <hi>Meruine.</hi> The fourth
day approaching, <hi>Mermont</hi> prepared to go home againe to
the city, which he did, but <hi>Meruin</hi> staid behind: the reason
was, he had that morning found out a daintie spotted yong
goate, whose colour and beauty so well pleased him, that he
sware he would haue it to bestow on his ladie <hi>Berea:</hi> but
no sooner offred he to assaile it, but it fled, and with all spéed
pursued it, euen till in the maine chase, he had vtterly l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sight of it, which not alitle grieued him, but when wisedom
told him there was no auaile in anger, he sought te return,
but the greedines of his sport had expelled the knowledge
of his way from his memorie, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s he knew not where.
The spie whose eies neuer forsooke him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perceiuing his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
thwarting through strange paths, placed himselfe
in a way through which <hi>Meruin</hi> of force must passe. When
<hi>Meruine</hi> saw the spie, he was more than well pleased and
demaunded of him: which way king <hi>Mermont</hi> his Lord
rode: Sir said the spie, if it please you to follow me, I will
conduct you: so the spie led the way, and <hi>Meruine</hi> folowed
him, whose hart was thoughtles of any treason. After they
had traueled long in a nightconcealing corner, <hi>Meruin</hi> said,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:12928:63"/>
friend, I feare me we are both out of our way. O sir, (repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he) feare not, I will bring you to the king my master pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently.
And as he was thus saying, they were arriued in the
place where the traitors were ambushed: and as soone as
<hi>Calix</hi> beheld him, hee, and with him fortie lanciers charged
<hi>Meruin</hi> behinde him, not speaking any word, and that with
such violence, that ere he dreamed of disaduantage, they had
throwen him to the ground from his mare foreward: but
like the flower of all knightly chiualrie in a trice he remoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himselfe vpon his féete, and drawing <hi>Entrant</hi> his sword,
flew vpon the spie, and gaue him such a blow that he cleaue
his head &amp; chaps in two pieces, saying: Uillaine thou which
hast led me to my death, in death shalt be my first companion.
But scarce were his words ended, before he was assailed on
euery side, with all fiue hundred: but he defended himselfe
more like a god then a mortall man: and questionlesse, had he
bene armed, as he was naked, twise so many as they, had not
taken him prisoner, for before he remoued his right foote, he
had laine an hundred dead before him. But now faint heat
ingendering within the torment of his incessant labour, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled
such a weakenesse through his all too extreme trauelled
members, that his handes began to wéepe in sweatie drops,
that they had power to weld his sword no longer, and his
bodie faultered, as most willing to die, sith it had least
strength to relieue his master: when they perceiued this, all
at once they cast themselues vpon him, and like a tempest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a princely forsaken building, ouerturned him to the
earth: then, as if too few, they all lay vpon him, some taking
from him his sword, some blinding his eyes, and some bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his handes behind him: this done. violently they dragd
him to a forsaken pine, whose mansion was so horrible, that
no liuing eye till then, had seene where he was planted. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it they bound him, and so leauing him, returned to
Montment. When <hi>Meruine</hi> beheld his pitilesse estate, he
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12928:63"/>
said; Ha diuine prophetesse of the world, faire <hi>Berea,</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
didst thou foretell my danger, and the hatred of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but my deafe resolution would neuer, till too late, beléeue

sighed out such heart-killing lamentations, that if the most
barbarous vplandish pesant, had but heard his meanes, he
would not onely haue melted, but haue beene partner of his
afflictions<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> All night continued <hi>Meruine</hi> in this wofulnes,
who in a moment had bin deuoured of sauage beasts, if som
heauenly power had not inspired his galant mare <hi>Mordant</hi>
with a man-like vnderstanding, who defended and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him from a thousand deadly daugers. <hi>Mermont</hi> who
was returned to his court in Montment, and vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Meruine</hi> was absent, grew excéedingly sorie: but the
traiterous <hi>Marrant</hi> tolde him, he was ridden alittle out of
the way to visite a gentlewoman, who dwelt neare vnto
the forrest, and that no other occasion withheld him. Which
report, although it satisfied the king at that present, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it was nothing sufficient to quiet <hi>Berea,</hi> who
incessantly inquired for her <hi>Meruine,</hi> and that not without
aboundance of teares, and intollerable sorrow, which when
her heart, too publike a tell-tale of her loue could with no

to publish the mountaine of her cares, which else would

she declared how <hi>Meruine</hi> her Lord and loue was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

After this was said, <hi>Marrant</hi> and <hi>Calix</hi> went to their bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chambers,

Madame, your lookes are gastly and dispairefull, how fareth

<hi>Berea</hi> with a sad countenance reported from point to point
all the treason committed against hor <hi>Meruine,</hi> and with
such féeling protestations, that all her amazement flew to

gathering her sences together, she said, It behoueth vs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame

By heauen, said <hi>Berea,</hi> I will tell it to the king my father.

the king:) tis <hi>Calix</hi> said <hi>Drohes.</hi> At that word the King
changed his colour, and calling before him a Sergeant at
armes, commaunding him to take a band of souldiers with
him, and fetch <hi>Calix</hi> before him, which immediately was
done, the rumor whereof astonished <hi>Marant,</hi> who went

pale, bowing his head to his breast, without speaking any
word: which the king perceiuing he said: false traitor, why
takest thou not the gage which he offereth? by the saith I
beare vnto <hi>Mahomet,</hi> if thou be guilty, all the golde in the
world shall not ransome thée from a shameful death. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
it not qd <hi>Calix,</hi> and then lifting aloft his head, took vp
his gage. <hi>Marant</hi> séeing what had passed, aduising himselfe
said to the king: Now your maiesty must assigne vs a day
of combate, to the end we may assemble our friends and
kinred together, to behold the combate, and my selfe will be
pledge for the fealtie of <hi>Calix</hi> my kinsman. By <hi>Mahomet</hi>
saith the king, I vnderstand not your intention, but as I
am king of this region, I will not eate, till I sée an end of
this dissention. Then forthwith was <hi>Calix</hi> commaunded
to be armed, and <hi>Iacob</hi> carried <hi>Drohes</hi> to the chamber of
<hi>Berea,</hi> who gaue him the most excellentest wines, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
conserues, that time or experience had found out, of all
which he tasted with good appetite, making himselfe strong
and lusty. Then was he armed in euery péece according
to his owne liking, and when he was readily prepared, he
mounted on his horse <hi>Marcheuall,</hi> which sometimes was
belonging to the famous duke <hi>Oger,</hi> then taking a launce
in his hand, trotted in stately maner into the great court,
ioyning on the castle of Turgon, which the king had then
caused to be prepared for that dreadfull battell, a world of
gallant cheualiers attended <hi>Drohes</hi> into the lists. And a

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:12928:66"/>
besought, that if he were discomfited, yet that he would not
accuse him, and he would quickely procure his peace with
the king. <hi>Calix</hi> agréed, giuing his faith thereunto, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred

though sickenes had made weake, yet his courage as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible,

were in a readines, the king said, Champions stand forth,
for I will that the occasion of this battell be published vnto
euery one, say therfore <hi>Drohes</hi> of what thou accusest him.
I say qd <hi>Drohes,</hi> and what I say, this sword and arme
shal witnes to be true, that this traitor <hi>Calik</hi> here present,
hath murdred <hi>Meruine</hi> in the forest, where your highnes
yesterday hunted, as I will proue vpon his body before it
be night. It is a false he said <hi>Calix,</hi> I neuer had thought of
so monstrous treason, in signe whereof, I defie thee, and
craue no other redéemer than this hand and the combat.
This said, retiring themselues, the trumpets sounded, and
they putting spurs to their horses, charged ech other. <hi>Calix</hi>
valiantly assailed <hi>Drohes,</hi> breaking his launce into manie
shiuers, but <hi>Drohes</hi> answerd him with so strong a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buffe,
that he threw him to the ground backeward: but in
a moment be rose againe, and drawing his sword, saide to
him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Traitor, if thou dismountest not thy selfe, I will kill
thy horse: at that word <hi>Drohes</hi> alighted, &amp; with his sword
charged <hi>Calix</hi> so mightily, that had not his weapon turnd,
it had bin the first &amp; last of the battel: yet for all this ill hap, it
fell with so huge a power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as hewing away his pouldrons &amp;
laces, it pierced his flesh so far, as the traitor shrunke. Then
said <hi>Drohes,</hi> villaine, ere thou and I depart, I will make
thée dance before the K. a Morisco galliard. <hi>Calix,</hi> as much
ashamed at the contempt, as grieued with the blow, rushed
vpon <hi>Drohes,</hi> and strucke him with so manly a puissance,
as thearth and flowers thereon trembled, and withall, the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:12928:67"/>
sword glauncing downe, cutte away one of <hi>Drohes</hi> spurs,
and alittle of the flesh with it, insomuch, that he wanted li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of falling ouer and ouer: and let no man thinke it anie
dishonour, considering his weaknes, and the long liuing
paine of his sicknes. Then <hi>Drohes</hi> lifting his heart to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
said; Swéet Iesus, thou diuine sauiour of the world,
look downe from heauen vpon me, and lend strength to my
weake arme to vanquish this miscreant, sith all the end of
my act is to exalt thy diuine Godhead. As he was thus
speaking, <hi>Calix</hi> strucke him againe with such mercilesse vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor,
as he turned about and staggerd iij. times in amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Then said <hi>Calix</hi> (whose pride lifted him higher then
his fortune:) by the allegeance I owe to our great prophet,
if thou doest not immediately confesse before the king, that
thou hast accused me falsely of this treason, ere the sunn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mounting his sword, he smote <hi>Calix</hi> on the helmet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he
fell to the ground: yet instantly he rose vp againe, but by
the glauncing of the blade, was cut from his right thigh a
piece of flesh enough to haue gorged a cast of Falcons for a
whole day. <hi>Calix</hi> made mad with this ill misfortune, gras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
his sword in both his hands came right against <hi>Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hes,</hi>
meaning with that blow to make an end of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate:
but <hi>Drohes</hi> turning himselfe sodainely, for the sword
came as thunder or lightning, wisely slipt aside, &amp; the sword
vnstaied by any interception, droue into the ground more
than a foot and a halfe, and that with such vnusuall vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that by no power he had, could it be drawne backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
<hi>Drohes</hi> sé<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing this leapt before <hi>Calix,</hi> and strucke
him in such maner, that he cut off the arme which then was
contending with the sword for mastery: the anguish wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
made him fall to the earth. But <hi>Drohes</hi> striking, in his
falling, cut one of his legges off also: the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orment whereof
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:12928:67"/>
made him cry that the whole assembly heard him. When
the traiterous <hi>Marant</hi> saw <hi>Calix</hi> thus vanquished, in a
moment he mounted himselfe on horseback, and neuer gaue
ouer flying, till he came into the strong city of Minor that
was gouerned by king <hi>Butor</hi> his father, <hi>Drohes</hi> now
séeing there was no power left in <hi>Calix</hi> to defend himselfe
any longer, said, Traitor, this mischiefe hath thy sinne hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
vpon thée, know then I wil kil thee in the sight of this
assembly, if thou confessest not thy treason, and the murder
of <hi>Meruine.</hi> Now by <hi>Mahomet</hi> said <hi>Calix,</hi> my thoughts
are guiltlesse of his euill: at that word <hi>Drohes</hi> cut off his
other arme. Then said <hi>Calix,</hi> ha excellent knight <hi>Drohes,</hi>
be no more my tormenter, but call the king, and to him I
will report all things touching <hi>Meruine.</hi> Then came the
king, and with him many barons to heare his confession, to
whom he told all their committed treason: the first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the continuing, and executing: lastly, how, and
in what maner they left him, &amp; the place where his sword
was hidden. Then to the king he said, My liege, lay hands
on your kinseman <hi>Marrant,</hi> for it was he alone wrought
vs all the mischiefe, for which now my heart is inwardly
sory. When the king had heard all he could say, he caused
him to be dragged by the strength of horses into the field,
where he was hanged according vnto the custome of
traitors in those countries. And thus will we
leaue to speake of him, and returne to
our former matter.

and being come to the woods, they ranged a long
time, but could not find the fatall place of his abiding.</p>
                     <p>2 But at last <hi>Mordant</hi> the courageous mare, neighed

mare in these parts: let vs ride towards her with all spéed,
which doing, they found the mare in the midst of the high
way, but <hi>Meruine</hi> by no means could their eyes recouer.
Then halowed the king alowd, saying: Ha, my dearest and

thou be neare me, conceale not thy selfe from him, who so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

knew by the resounding, hee turned his head with great

reported the king vnto him all the circumstances of <hi>Drohes</hi>

And for mine owne part, I vowe by him that
died for me, this day to giue my name such life amongst the

honour, whose courageous spirites like lions, were neuer
tamed, yet they were all excéeding yoong, the oldest amongst
them hauing not as yet attained to the age of xxj. yéeres.
Now God of his goodnesse prosper their procéedings, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

the signe of battel giuen by the trumpets sounding, <hi>Bertran</hi>

                        </gap>e sayd: Brother, if to euery one I
pay this payment, I beléeue the pagans will game nothing
by my tendure. Nowe began the batttell to bee mightie on
both sides, and <hi>Guion</hi> leauing his brother, thrust himselfe
amongst the middest of the pagans, where the first hée met,
he threw dead to the gronnd, and in like maner made an end
of the second. Briefly, before his lance was broken, he sent
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:12928:72"/>
some to the earth to acompany their forefathers: but when
his lance was broken, then he drew his sword, and méeting
with a pagan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

another. <hi>Bertran</hi> this while being amongst the thickest
bandes of his enemies, encountred a pagan, who was the
cosin to <hi>Esclamart,</hi> to whom he lent such a salutation, that
he claue him downe euen to the girdle, which another pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
beholding, ran to <hi>Esclamart,</hi> and sayd, Generall, thy
noble cosine is slaine by a christian, see where he lieth, and
see where his foe rangeth. When as <hi>Esclamart</hi> saw <hi>Bertran</hi>
possessed with a fellonious rage of immortall reuenge, hee
thrust spurres to his horse, and assailed <hi>Bertran</hi> with such
puissance, that with the force of his present blowe, he strake
his horse dead vnder him: but <hi>Bertran</hi> quickly vawted on
his feete againe, and with his sword in his hand, ranne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the pagan, against whom he boyled to obtaine but one
straight blow, but by any meanes, he could not for the prease:
yet notwithstanding reaching one, he light so violently on
the head of his horse, that it was more then time for <hi>Escla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mart</hi>
to beare him companie on foote also: and <hi>Bertran</hi> then
running against him, had there slaine him, but there swarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
such innumerable troupes of pagans about him, that if
God himselfe had not bene his defender, <hi>Bertran</hi> then had
breathed no longer. Yet for all this, the gentle yong gallant
miraculously behaued himselfe, for he strake not any pagan,
but he seuered the life from the body. <hi>Isay</hi> the king of <hi>Iuda</hi>
seing <hi>Bertran</hi> thus courageous, thrust himselfe against him,
but there was mightie follie in his worke, for <hi>Bertran</hi> met
him in the middest of his carier with such a blowe, that hee
claue his head to his collar. O <hi>Mahomet,</hi> said <hi>Esclamart,</hi>
this christian is possessed with some deuill, what mischiefe he
doeth me: and then he cried to all his souldiers, promising
prizes of great worth to him that could take him. Then was
the famous gallant assayled on euery side, but like an inraged
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:12928:72"/>
bore, he ranged amongst them, and in such sort defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that the pagans like larkes fell vnder the houerings of
his wings. But yet alas, all his prowesse had profited him
but litle, and he was at the point of taking or killing, when
<hi>Thyery</hi> &amp; <hi>Florion</hi> his brothers, with <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi>
with diuors christians, by great chance came to his rescue.
Brother <hi>Bertran</hi> (said <hi>Florion</hi>) now or neuer remember
who you are, and banish the feare of a pagan infidell, and
with that word he thrust into the prease, ouerturning and
killing al that stood betweene him and his brother. When
<hi>Bertran</hi> saw him, he tooke new courage, and like a lion rouz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himselfe with greater furie: in so much, that he strake <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamart</hi>
to the earth, whom <hi>Florion</hi> like a gripe seized vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and deliuered him to two stoute christians, who bare
him to their tents. Then began the battell <hi>Hydra</hi>-like to
renew, in which the pagans died without number, for whom
soeuer <hi>Bertran</hi> touched, neuer more stood need of the phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
on the other side his brother <hi>Guion</hi> did wonders who
encountred a king named <hi>Afriquant,</hi> who was exceeding
strong and valiant, him <hi>Guion</hi> ouerthrew to the ground,
but a band of Sarazens despight his head, mounted him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and assailed <hi>Guion</hi> in cruell maner: but like a wise and
valiant knight, he defended himselfe from their furie. Then
came <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> who like a valiant knight of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
vertue, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

when he saw yong <hi>Guion</hi> in hazard, he turn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Atal this, the battell weakened no deale, yet might you

horses posting about the fieldes, as atomies playing

<hi>Guyon,</hi> it is conuenient that we goe séeke him. Then put
they themselues into the battell to search him out, but could
not find him: and there was reason, for he was straightly
imprisoned at Damascus in a strong tower. When <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tran</hi>
saw he could not find him, he took a solemne oath, that
nothing but the extreame darknes of the night should driue
him from the field, and with that he beganne a new conflict,

entred king <hi>Bandus</hi> into the towne, with tenne thousand
that suruiued of an hundred thousand and better. Thus the
Sarazens were ouerthrowne by the valure of our Barons:
who as the storie reports, were so noble in their conquests,
that nothing could resist them. They in this battel lost but

foure thousand men, and the wealth they gained was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable,
that the basest in the Christian army, was able
to purchase a castle. Besides kings, they had an hundred of
the greatest pagans prisoners. Yet for all this, the generals
were not committed, but sorrowed for the losse of their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Florion,</hi> to whose fortune they knew not what had
chaunced. Briefly, their woe was so great, that no tong

But letting those things passe, tell me I pray
thée, from what line art thou descended? My fathers name,

such wonders, that the bloody liuery my sword shall put on,

couered, the noble company sate downe to supper, where
they were honourably serued. After supper, as soone as the
tables were taken away, and the watch set, the Generals
went to their rest, til the morning starre awakened the sun
from slumber: then rising and arming themselues, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialled
their army into a warlike proportion, intending to
assault the pagans, who on the other side were euery deale so
watchfull, and stoode ready to behold the signall. <hi>Guion</hi> the
vertuous Dane beholding both parties equall preparation,
fell downe vpon his knées, and thus prayed: Thou true

vouchsafe that our soules may be placed with thy saints in

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:12928:81"/>
the Pagans with <hi>Bertran,</hi> who most stoutly made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.
Then <hi>Mermont</hi> rising vp saide to <hi>Bertran:</hi> All thy
linage hath béene the scourge and ruine of our religion: and
I am too well assured, that nothing but your deaths can giue
peace to our quiet: wherefore <hi>(Meruine)</hi> it is most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
they die, to excuse our further trouble. Not so my
Lorde (aunswered <hi>Meruine</hi> againe) wee will not wedde
Tyranny and Conquest together: besides, I vowed in my
selfe, not to doe them indignitie, till I haue taken, as them,
their father <hi>Gautier</hi> prisoner: which done, I will in a royall

and giue battel to the emperor <hi>Charles</hi> that is surnamed
Great: and by the aid of <hi>Mahomet</hi> I doubt not to bring
all France to my subiection. When <hi>Meruine</hi> had thus said,
he commanded the foure brethren and all thother christian
prisoners to be strongly imprisoned in an impregnable tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
where <hi>Bertran</hi> consumed his time in lamentation for his
royall father and mother. It hapned that <hi>Guyda,</hi> &amp; <hi>Goham</hi>
the brother of <hi>Gaifier,</hi> being one day vnder the turret, they
heard the complaints of the haplesse Christians. Sir (saide
<hi>Guyda</hi>) what is he that now speaketh, know you his voice?
Madam (saide <hi>Goham</hi>) it is the mightiest of the 4 brethren,
and the most absolute knight in the world next <hi>Meruine,</hi> &amp;
his name (as I take it) is <hi>Bertran,</hi> whose linage is as great
as his minde, both incomprehensible. After these speeches
they departed: but from <hi>Guyda</hi> neuer departed the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce

him whilest her heart entertained a sympathy of his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Now were they returned to the pallace, where all the

all his army to be mustred, for he would instantly
march towards Babylon. Wherefore calling king <hi>Bandus</hi>
vnto him, he gaue him the charge and gouernement of that
citie of <hi>Damascus,</hi> swearing him to his allegeance, and
with carefull respect to nourish and guard the honourable
christian prisoners, and also with all the reuerent obseruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

we will leaue them, and a while discourse
of other matters.

had heard this thunder of a dismall oracle, his heart

                        </gap>sure: at last,
though it were long ere wordes could find way from amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he said: How can this be true which thou reportest,
when thou saist, my sonnes are detained prisoners? <hi>Gualtier</hi>
(replied the Pagan) it is most true: then leaue to wonder,
and giue answere to mine embassage.</p>
                     <p>3 At this, for a space they dismist the Pagans whilest the
christians betooke themselues to counsell, where <hi>Gualtier</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
what course was to be taken in these times of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie.
Great princes (said Duke <hi>Naymes</hi>) this is my
opinion: to the embassadours should no indignitie be offred,
both because they are but the tongues of others hearts, and
also because our barons whom they detaine, are subiect to the
like vengeance, wherefore let vs demaund aide of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
King <hi>Karaheu</hi> of Iuda, and of the king <hi>Moysant,</hi> and
his sonne <hi>Florion,</hi> intreating them, to whose religion and
land it as nearely concerneth, spéedily to repaire with their
forces, and maintaine the Temples of our God, and our
owne liberties. To this counsell euery one concluded. Then
sending for the Pagans againe, thus <hi>Gualtier</hi> made them
answere: Pagans, returne to your Lordes at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and say to <hi>Mermont</hi> and the others, that I am hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
sorie for the thraldome of my sonnes yet can I not alter
their fortunes: as for their inuasion, if they come to ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

natiue honour in mée, or till the glorious God of my crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
forsake mée. Say hée saide thus, who will doe thus?
With this answere the Pagans reparted, and <hi>Gualtier</hi>
dispatched Letters to King <hi>Karaheu:</hi> and the Emperour
<hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Gualtier</hi> himselfe went to Ierusalem, where
they found the good king <hi>Moysant,</hi> who entertained them
with royalty beyond expectation. To him <hi>Gualtier</hi> receun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his sonnes misfortunes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the threats of his own ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
to whome <hi>Moysant</hi> promised all the aide and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
of his kingdome. Then went they to the holy sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,
where they offered vp their vowes, gifts, and protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and then with all spéede returned backe to Babylon,
where they found <hi>Claretta</hi> the Quéene in great perplexitie
of sorrow for the losse of her foure sonnes. The same daie
arriued king <hi>Karaheu</hi> with seuentéene thousand knights of
estimation, all which were gallantly receiued. The next
morning came <hi>Florion</hi> of <hi>Mesque</hi> with fiue thousand, and
his father <hi>Moysant</hi> with as many: olde <hi>Guyon</hi> of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,

himselfe lord and master of Mesques, dor he had a desire to

priuately conuerse with me, as I know she secretly wéepeth
her loue to him, I would in one naturall day deliuer both my

but <hi>Guyda</hi> entred into the chamber, who with a modest
grauity (the cloud of an impatient loue) saluted them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
of their welfare. Madam (said <hi>Bertran</hi>) my health
is in the hand of thy mercy: and but thou giue end to my
sickenesse, there is no creature can preserue me from a sodaine
dying. When she heard these speeches, with a frosty blush
of a little wonder, she answered, Prince, repose a while,
and immediately you shall know, if helpe bee in my power.
Then she went forth and called the Gaoler vnto her, whose
name was <hi>Corbun,</hi> and intreated him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

leape and caper through the chamber, whilest <hi>Huon</hi> with

Huon</hi> stay here a little till I call thée: Agréed said <hi>Huon:</hi>

be secret, for feare of daunger. Feare not excellent Madam

Then shee commaunded <hi>Corbun</hi> to bring <hi>Huon</hi>
vnto her. Madam, said <hi>Corbun,</hi> I dare not, lest I bring the
life of king <hi>Bandus</hi> in question. Your Ladyship is too bold in
these rash aduentures, and nurse mischiefe in gracing these
christians, I fear some euil wil succeed this hazard: wherfore
if <hi>Bertran</hi> returne not instantly, I will reueale his being to

in so saying, he drew néere to <hi>Corbun:</hi> to whom with his

without anie word speaking. When <hi>Guyda</hi> saw what hée

Pagan ouer-hearing them, without tarrying ranne to the

this said, they marched forward, and the Pagans
likewise: to whom king <hi>Gorbant</hi> made many orations of

that for the honour of his God, he might be the first to
giue the charge in that battaile. <hi>Meruine</hi> in loue with his
forwardnesse, bade him passe on, and be fortunate. At that
word <hi>Thyerrie</hi> thrust spurres to his horse, and comming
euen vnto the face of the Pagans host, he saide: What is

and man to the ground, the Turke had neuer againe risen,

The renowmed <hi>Meruine</hi> broaching the braue

many acts of admriable chiualrie that day seconded him.
There might ye haue heard such clamors, such noyse, and
tempestuous outrage, as if the clouds had resigned to the
earth a greater power, than the power of their thunder. In
the middest of the battell <hi>Meruine</hi> met with <hi>Thierrie,</hi> the
valiant son of <hi>Bourchier,</hi> whom for the valor he expressed
in the first incounter, he embraced about the necke, &amp; after
kissing him, gaue him the sacred order of knighthood, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Hapfull bloome of a happy issue, this houre I giue to

where he shewed his dalour to be augmented by the
honor he had obtained. <hi>Gaultier</hi> all this while made great
slaughter of the enemies, being inflamed with a double fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
the one of reuenge for wrongs forepassed, the other of
desire to sée his foure sonnes, who during this battell were
in the pallace at Damascus, which by the meanes of <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>

Insomuch, that calling vp his brothers, he saide:

then she was offended with <hi>Bertran,</hi> both because he had
most vnkindly left her, and was also one of the sonnes that
had slaine her father, and the rest of her royall kinred. Thus
fled king <hi>Gorbant,</hi> who met with <hi>Bandus, Gryffoy, Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,</hi>
and with ten thousand Pagans, all which, to saue
their liues, were fled to the seaside, vnto whom <hi>Gorbant</hi>
cried, Away princes, away, for he that is tardy in flight,
shall be first and swiftest in his death. At this speach, feare
lent wings to their héels, and they al imbarking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues,

chase was finished, our Christian Princes went towardes
Damascus to assault it, but the Citizens issuing from the
portes, brought the keyes, and with submission deliuered
them to their mercies, so that <hi>Meruine, Gautier,</hi> and the
rest of the Christians entred, who by means of that battell
were not aboue 200. After they had reposed themselues a
while, <hi>Gautier</hi> called vnto him his foure sonnes, and said:

of his prowesse, the taking of <hi>Charles,</hi> the ouerthrow of
the twelue peeres, and al their imprisonments. To be short,
he ran through all the chronicle of <hi>Meruines</hi> heroicall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and how <hi>Charles</hi> discontentedly was returned into
France for the hate of <hi>Huon. Huon</hi> hearing that word, as
rackt with his owne infortune, he said: O God, when shal
the houre come to bind me in perfit peace with that famous
emperor? <hi>Huon</hi> hauing thus said, he, <hi>Gautier,</hi> &amp; the foure
brethren did honor to <hi>Meruine,</hi> who returned them praise
for praise, thanks for thanks, vowing to aide them against
their enemies. Thus was the ioy vnspeakeable among the
Christians, making houres like minutes vanish by theyr
pleasures. Next morning, <hi>Meruine</hi> caused all the citizens
of Damascus to be christned, and whose refused, to be put
to the sword. This done, he caused all the countrey adioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to come in, and be baptized: whereto all the nobles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.
These things finished, <hi>Meruine</hi> called <hi>Florion,</hi> and
said: Cosin, for thy beauties sake, I giue thée this cittie of
Damascus, and the whole realme about it, accept it kindly,
as I giue it willingly: and then he made all the nobles and
citizens sweare homage and fealtie to his Crowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for
a gard to his person, left him those 200. Christians, which
the sword had preserued, mustering for himselfe out of the
citie and country two thousand that hardly before had born

                     <p>2 After that nights repast in the citie, <hi>Meruine, Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,</hi>
and the other princes departed from Damascus, and

be not an agent of our deliuery. Tis true qd <hi>Gotham,</hi> who

any mean for the restitution of our God and religion. The

and that he may the lesse mistrust vs, shalbe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
through the city, our conuersion: what will of this

so they arose, and hauing effected what they would,
took the keys of the city, and marched forth with great ioy
towards <hi>Meruine,</hi> who so soone as he sawe <hi>Mermont</hi> and

Alas his innocency thought not of the treason they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented.
By this they were come eyther to other, whilest

this riuer were made by Magike art, and this city named
Minor founded as a thing impregnable: for it hath before
the entraunce foure ports or passages strongly garded, the

powerfull continually to defend and kéepe it. Oueragainst
it is an other of the same strength, defended by one euen as

whose height séems to touch the heauens. After one

knowing <hi>Mermont</hi> since the bringing of his sister into

These words were spoken so faintly, that his armie like

But as they were in speaking, <hi>Gautier</hi> set vpon them

rage he strake a Christian, euen in the presence of <hi>Bertran,</hi>
such a mighty blow, that he fell dead at his feete. Which
when the vertuous prince beheld, he assailed the pagan so

preparing an inuincible army to returne withall to Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
By the health of my soule said <hi>Bertran,</hi> Ile blocke

Minor. Alas swéete sonne (said <hi>Gautier</hi>) how shall wee

answered the Prince, estéeme not fearefull descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for I haue inuented how and which way, to make
both our selues commanders of the towne, and princes of

and mounted on his horse, spread out his now infortunate
colours, and with such like company as he was attended
with, Ile march towards the towne, into which I know
I shall enter easily, because they will imagine me to be the
king of Nubia: which I will no sooner haue effected, but
I will gard the gates with such carefull resolution, that
famoused, so that in all the haste it was put in practise,
and fiue hundred Christians of the best respect were armed
both your Highnes and your army shal haue easie passage.

that beareth the Armes of Nubia, for whatsoeuer he bee,

<hi>Mermont</hi> (said <hi>Drohes</hi>) thou hast adiudged what best to

When <hi>Drohes</hi> saw there was no meane left him,
but either to acknowledge <hi>Bertran</hi> or denie himselfe, hee
said, Stay, and I will name him vnto you. Then raising
his voyce, that euery one might vnderstand him, hee said:
Princes, it is the most wise and absolute valiant <hi>Bertran</hi>
the sonne of <hi>Gautier,</hi> whose conquests stretch far beyond
these Clymates, and whose death the infants vnborne
hereafter shall bewaile if he miscarrie. When <hi>Butor</hi> had
heard his words, hee commaunded him to bee strongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned:
which was done. Then the Kings consulting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<hi>Mermont</hi> saide: My Lord of Minor, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
vnder your arrest Prince <hi>Bertran,</hi> so famous for
his valure, and renowmed for the discent of his royall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degree:
it behooues your maiestie to be most circumspect,
because at this instant you haue in thrall the triumuirate
of vertue, the itj. famous floures of Knighthood meaning

powerful, there should no euill befall prince <hi>Bertran,</hi> more
than the burden of her best loue, because his valure was
more than euer her eyes had seene before that instant time.
Whilst thus she was talking to her thoughts, all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Barons went out of the pallace, gathering all the
force that they could together to assaile <hi>Bertran,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

of her eies, and the loue-inticing pitie of her countenance,

Madame, so sacred is the beautie of thine heauenly eyes,
that euen me and my heart thou hast taken prisoner: well
maiest thou commaund me, whom thou hast inthralled, and
would God (were the time so gracious) that not here but
in France I might doe you seruice: but sacred Madame,
though my case be desperate, yet doe me a fauour for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,

tell me whether my companion be dead, or breathing

<hi>Bertran</hi> at this conquered with Beauties Oratorie, gaue
vp his sword into hir siluer hand, protesting that no feare
of death made him yield, but onely the commaundement
of beauty: to which beautie and her pittie he surrendered
his life and fortunes. <hi>Bertran</hi> now vnlaced his helmet,
and put it off whose former labour had raised so chearefull a
blood in his face, that <hi>Singlay</hi> esteemed him singuler in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
perfection, and Loud, ready at her elbow, doubled her
wounds, and redoubled her affection: wherefore she saide:
Come yong prince and follow me, but I pray you speake
to my father grauely and humbly; so shall your thraldome
be lesse streight, and I more able to doe you seruice. Hee
consented to do what euer she would commaund him: and
thus they came before <hi>Butor,</hi> whose first salutation was,
that immediately hee should loose his head, if hee fell not
downe and adored <hi>Mahomet:</hi> and <hi>Bertran</hi> inraged gaue
a reply contrary to his promise, saying: The threates of

their false man-deceiuing and diuelish protector. When
<hi>Singlay</hi> heard him speake with this spléene of malice, she
wept bitterly, fearing lest her father (who was subiect to
passion) should subscribe his will to her Loues funerall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which to preuent, she came and desired her father to leaue
argument, and to referre him to her, whom she doubted
not but quickely to change from his puritie, and make him
a religious Sarazen. Daughter said the king, I agrée, but
be you watchfull lest hee escape: for wee haue had toon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame

speake of <hi>Gautier,</hi> who all this while was before Minor,
continuing a siege against it the space of itj. yeares: but all
was to bootelesse purpose, for hee lost many and gained
nothing, the city was so impregnable. Wherefore holding
a Councell, it was thought expedient to raise theyr siege,
and returne backe vnto Montment, which they did, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of Minor: and that was all the reuenge they had for itj.
yeares trouble. Great was the hast <hi>Gautier</hi> made to come
to Montment, where he had left his vertuous wife <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta</hi>
and <hi>Mathaburna:</hi> but when he came, hee found
all his hopes ouerturned, for in his absence the cruel king
<hi>Gorbant</hi> had bin there, taken the towne, put <hi>Claretta</hi> to
death, and <hi>Mathaburna</hi> too, had not faint womanish feare
made her forsake her God, and fall once againe brfore <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet.</hi>
Beside, she did one other déede of great ilnes, that
after was a torment to her: and that was by the means of
<hi>Mordant,</hi> she trode vppon the Crucifire and the Image of
the virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> for which with this curse she was puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
That she would commit high treason against her son
<hi>Orient,</hi> which she did: for when his wife was deliuered
of seuen sons, she made them away, and perswaded her son
she had brought forth seuen dogges; for which the Ladies
life was hazarded, till God the reuealer of trueth, making
the trueth knowne, <hi>Mathaburna</hi> was burned deseruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as you may reade in the historie of <hi>Godfrey</hi> of Bullen.
But leauing those latter déedes, we will againe returne to

both he and his Sonnes fell into a great agonie of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment:

themselues: Alas, alas, these Christians are come to theyr
funeralles: for sith <hi>Meruine</hi> is dead, it is impossible for
them euer againe to see a day of conquest. They were to
the number of an hundred thousand, and thus quartered:
<hi>Griffoy</hi> bare the ensigne of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and had thirtie
thousand, King <hi>Bandus</hi> had other thirty thousand, and
<hi>Griffoner</hi> with a regiment to second him; <hi>Gorbant</hi> with

though not so huge, yet full as strongly: and thus
<hi>Gautier,</hi> after incouragements to his sonnes, put spurres

began a clamorous noise (greater than thunder from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,)
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:12928:127"/>
and the battell was mightily confused, <hi>Gorbant</hi>
if his armes had béene excellently imployed, his vertue in
valure had inherited alittle better than excellent.</p>
                     <p>By letting his déed passe, we will speake of <hi>Iacob,</hi> who
folowing <hi>Gautier</hi> with foure hundred Christians, and sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fearefulnesse and hugenesse of the battell, said vnto
his souldiers; Gentlemen, this day it behooueth vs to be
most circumspect what we take in hand, you do sée the rare
mightines of the battell, and the equalitie of puissance: let
vs then aduise our selues what way is best for our generall
profit, which (in my conceipt) is this, Whilest the two
armies are thus equally busied, we will assault the towne
now vtterly vndefended, and making our entrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
put man, woman and child to the sword, that will not
fall downe and adore the name of Christ Iesus. To this
(with clamours) they all agréed, and forthwith entred the
Towne which was left vngarded, and beganne to put to

                        </gap>he sword all with whom they incountred. But the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
people soone rendred to mercie, and accepted a second
baptisme. The <hi>Iacob</hi> went to the castle of Turgon with
his followers, where he found <hi>Guyda</hi> and <hi>Barrant</hi> her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
sonne, surnamed the Cruell, and <hi>Berea:</hi> to whom <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
said, Madame, great and infinite are the mischiefes
that hang houering ouer thy head, if so soone thou hast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
prince <hi>Meruine,</hi> and renounced the Christian true
lawe of saluation. Ha <hi>Iacob</hi> (said <hi>Mathaburna</hi> with a
wéeping face) chide me not, for in my heart I adore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but that true God of my saluation: what else I haue
done, this life (which onely I loue but for his loue) hath
with carefulnesse drawne me hereto. You make me prowd
qd <hi>Iacob,</hi> with these words: know then, I haue taken
(with these my followers) both the towne and this castle:
wherefore I will leaue two hundred to gard you, and with
the rest returne to the great battell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:12928:128"/>
This said, he tooke his leaue, and (after safe order ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the Towne and Castle) he returned to the tumult,
where he shewed himselfe to be a most resolued and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
gentleman, whose resolution when <hi>Gautier</hi> sawe,
he commended excéedingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with promise of great honors.
My Lord, saide <hi>Iacob,</hi> my beginning hath béene better
than my procéeding, for I haue taken both the citty, and
Turgon. Wherefore if you doubt your successe, you may
make your retraite therein, for it is your owne assured.
When <hi>Gautier</hi> heard this he daunced for ioy, and in that
place created him knight, kissing his chéeke, and praying
for his endlesse good fortunes. <hi>Iacob</hi> so prowd with these
honours, that the first pagan that he met he sent dead to the
ground, and then rushing into the heart of the army, made
wondrous destructions: which king <hi>Gorbant</hi> beholding,
inraged he ranne against him, and gaue him such a blow,
that he felled him to the earth: by means whereof the good
<hi>Iacob</hi> was taken prisoner, and now came the battell to the
extreamest hazard, for the Pagans being an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
and the Christians but twelue thousand, the greater
number prenailed, wherefore <hi>Gautier</hi> commaunded a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait
to be sounded, and so retired into the citie: at the sight
whereof <hi>Gorbant</hi> tore his haire and was madly inraged,
not leauing to assault the towne on each side, but in vaine,
for in his despight it was strongly maintained. When as
armes and fury was laid at rest, <hi>Gautier</hi> went to the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
where reposing himselfe he made inquirie for <hi>Iacob,</hi>
but not any could tell of him or his fortune. Good God said
he! shall we loose that good knight? is it possible that vertue
should so soone vanish? and with that hee shed teares for
affection. This while <hi>Guyon</hi> went to <hi>Guyda,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her by the hand, said, Faire Lady, how comes your
fortune to hale you into this coast? and whose is this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
you beare with you? Ah <hi>Guyon</hi> said she<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is my son:
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:12928:128"/>
but I pray you, how doth your brother <hi>Bertran?</hi> O he
was mightily false to me at Damascus, when leauing me
along he estéemed more his sword, than mine honour, for
hatefull reuenge whereof I instantly married king <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi>
his greatest enemy. Thus she discoursed her aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to <hi>Guyon,</hi> whilest her husband and <hi>Griffoy</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the city, stoode tearing their haires for their losses. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some consultations held, they sent for <hi>Iacob,</hi> and tolde
him that if he would go to Montment and persuade <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier</hi>
to send him forth of the city his wife and yong son, he
would deliuer all the christian prisoners that were that day
taken. <hi>Iacob</hi> glad of these words (for he mightily feared
death) said, willingly I will performe thy desire, so I may
haue sufficient pledge for the trueth of thy promise. Then
<hi>Gorbant</hi> called <hi>Bandus, Griffoy,</hi> and <hi>Grifoner,</hi> and sent
them for hostages of his word: so they came into Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

which done, I will passe into Montment, deliuer your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

their pouerty was so great, they could no longer indure

<hi>Gautier</hi> dispatcht other letters to <hi>Gorbant,</hi> who had then

<hi>Bertran, Drohes,</hi> and the other Pagans. At which feast,
<hi>Guyda</hi> tooke her sonne <hi>Barant</hi> aside, and saide; Deare

boast, who little knew the news that <hi>Adain</hi> brought, who
priuately deliuered a letter vnto <hi>Bertran</hi> from his father:
which when he had read, he shewd it to <hi>Drohes,</hi> then they
two agreed to arme themselues vnder their dublets, which
they did, and then went into king <hi>Gorbants</hi> tent, desiring,
that for the happines of the news there might be a festiual
proclaimed, and solempne banquets and Iubilies made
through all the campe, with proclamation, that for that
day no man, on paine of death, should put on an armour, or
weare a sword, but consecrate all his deeds with mirth to
<hi>Mahomet. Gorbant</hi> though this motion conuenient, and
forthwith sent his edicts and proclamations abroad, which
were fulfilled.</p>
                     <p>2 <hi>Gautier</hi> the holy Dane all this while was within

<hi>Gautier</hi> left the citie, hauing in his army but onely tenne
thousand souldiers, which was all his remainder, and
made so great haste, that they entred the Pagan campe, to
the dismay of their aduersaries. <hi>Gautier</hi> with his sword
naked entred into <hi>Gorbants</hi> tent, and came close to the
table where <hi>Bertran</hi> sate, who when he beheld his fathers
armes, ouerthrew the table, and catching a battle axe in
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:12928:137"/>
his hand which was there, he strucke king <hi>Gorbant</hi> such
a blow betwixt the necke and the shoulders, that he diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his head from his body. At which fight all the pagans
were amazed, but <hi>Griffoner</hi> of Damascus cried, <hi>Bertran</hi>
this day, by treason, will be our destruction: and then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Barant</hi> and his sister, he fled away with twenty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,
whom we will leaue to their flight, and returne
to the battell, which begunne in <hi>Gorbants</hi> tent, and so
generally through all the campe, in which scarce a Pagan
or Sarazen suruiued: mighty was the resolution of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tran,</hi>
and glorious to behold his valure, whom none durst
incounter, and from whom none escaped. <hi>Mermont,</hi> who
before time had lost his hand, séeing this vnmoueable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie,
cried, Woe and alas we are all betraied, ha louely
<hi>Singlay,</hi> thou and this <hi>Adain</hi> are mistresses of our sorrow.

it is now twelue yeares since thou diddest mocke
Christianitie, to which I am conuerted, and most falsly
betrayedst the most exquisite <hi>Meruine</hi> vnto a tormenting
hell that hath no ending, record that mischiefe, and confesse
what thou deseruest. As she was thus speaking, <hi>Bertran</hi>
rushed in vpon <hi>Mermont,</hi> and saide: Uillaine, now shall

Then the Kings and Princes went to counsaile touching
their weighty warres affaires: in which it was concluded,
that the towne should be victualled and manned for many

the Christians mounted on horseback, Prince

Battaile, huge, fearefull, and wondrous vncertaine. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Prince <hi>Bertran</hi> (like a Tyger in a flocke) made
hauocke of the Pagans, and (at the first incounter) slew a
Kinsman of <hi>Bahams,</hi> whose legge hee brake of Minor.
Three other Pagans at one instant charged prince <hi>Loys</hi>

for he would not leaue him till he saw him newly remoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
At these words (with his axe) hee slew a pagan, and
taking his horse (in despight of his Enemies) mounted
<hi>Loys.</hi> Then increased the fiercenesse of the Battaile,

prince <hi>Loys:</hi> to whom they said, that all their liues were
forfeite, and there was no way to saue their honours but
death, beeing now inclosed on euery side. Which when

him; because they prised his life as a holie relique: and for
that cause force perforce they brought him to the pallace, the

themselues carried <hi>Loys</hi> and the rest to <hi>Barant</hi> the Cruell:
who taking a stormy view of them, first asked duke <hi>Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>

a Burgesse of this City, this is my Sonne, these

wine, and an hundred Quarters of wheate, all which I
haue ready in my house in Maiance, of which king <hi>Charles</hi>
hath no notice; for and if he had, he would seaze it, and
leaue me nothing. <hi>Barant</hi> was glad of this offer, because
his victualles were spent, and he had reinforced two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

yet did the Duke desire hostage for the performance of their
deliuerie, which he had: and then went he to the Citie to
<hi>Charles,</hi> whose sorrow smiled to behold him, and tolde
him what was done, which the Emperour highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,

say nothing at all, but I will, and if thou be so pleased,
send thee vnto a place where (as I doe verily imagine)
thou shalt vnderstand any thing: and thus it is, Thou
must goe into Iuda, and inquire for the Hermite of that

Pilgrime (said the Hermite) I vnderstand all that thou
séekest; wherefore, for thy loues sake, which I find to be so
perfect, I will doe mine indeuoure: stay here then till my
returne, and thou shalt haue thy séeking. Then went the
Hermite into his study, and beganne to coniure, till a spirit
appeared vnto him, and demaunded his will. Tell me
quoth the Hermite, where is Prince <hi>Meruine</hi> prisoner?
and by what meanes may he be deliuered? He which will
haue him restored answered the spirite, must goe into the
Ile of Dordon, where dwelleth an Hermite named <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baster,</hi>

till he were deliuered by a man whose mother died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

departed with such a tempest, that all the corners of the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

<hi>Charlemaine,</hi> who was called by the name of <hi>Baldwine,</hi>
but of <hi>Meruine</hi> I neuer heard before, nor of any of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p>2 Then spake <hi>Malabeon</hi> his father, and saide, Sonne,
it is very true, that <hi>Oger</hi> begot the valiant Prince <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine</hi>
of the Fairie Lady <hi>Morgua</hi> in the Fairie land, which
I know right well that was present at his baptizing, as
the Fairie can well witnesse with me, who stole him from
his mother, and for griefe thereof, knowing herselfe to be
damned, suffered a diuell to beget on her a monster with
thrée heads, that hereafter shall bring all Christendome to
a most wofull heauinesse, vntill by that famous and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
renowmed Prince <hi>Meruine</hi> he be brought vnto some
shamefull end, whom it behooueth thée to deliuer, because
now the date of his destiny is expired, and if he be not the
sooner redéemed, all Christendome will be vtterly ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Barant</hi> surnamed the Cruell, against whom no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature
is able to indure battell, except <hi>Meruine,</hi> in whose
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:12928:154"/>
hands the tyrants life is contained: Father quoth <hi>Roba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
by what manner of meanes may I worke his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraunce?
Uery easily answered <hi>Malabeon,</hi> for I will
first goe alone to Minor, and waiting the comming out of
<hi>Mutafier</hi> (who shall not see me) steale priuately away the
keys of the prison, and then returning for thée, by the helpe
of the highest Sonne deliuer him. Good father said <hi>Roba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
help vs in this holy déed. I will dispatch it and returne
quoth <hi>Malabeon,</hi> before the day goe downe. <hi>Drohes</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this, ouercome with ioy, embraced <hi>Robaster</hi> in his
armes, and asked if he euer sawe his father. Yes said he,
but besides my selfe, not any creature. In sundry other
discourses they continued vntill <hi>Malabeon</hi> returned from
Minor with the keyes, and bade them arise, for now was
the time to goe and deliuer <hi>Meruine,</hi> for beholde, here are
<hi>Mutafiers</hi> keys. When the two barons heard this, they
leapt for ioy, and <hi>Drohes</hi> maruelled that he was so soone
returned. Stand not amazed (said <hi>Malabeon</hi>) but let vs be
gone, for if <hi>Mutafier</hi> shall chaunce to returne, and finde
his keyes taken away, it may be he will do the prince some
iniurie. Alas said <hi>Drohes,</hi> how shall wee be able in a
moment to goe more than an hundred leagues? Care not
(said <hi>Malabeon</hi>) onely arme your selues and doe but follow
me, which they did, and then casting pilgrims weedes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
them, went so that no man could possibly perceiue their
armors, and at the last came to the riuer Orbe, ouer which
(by the helpe of <hi>Malabeon</hi>) they passed vpon a little
planke of wood, and then came vnto the view of <hi>Minor,</hi>
where <hi>Malabeon</hi> commaunded them, that as soone as they
should come before <hi>Butor,</hi> that they should fayne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

say, that <hi>Barant</hi> the Cruel had by his prowesse taken both
<hi>Charles</hi> and the twelue peeres, assuring them that hee
woulde stand by them, and giue aduise in euery action.</p>

Then afterwards in the very dead of the night, at what
time euerie creature shall be at their rest, we will goe to
the prison and set renowmed <hi>Meruine</hi> at libertie before it
be midnight. This being said, they went forward euen to
the city gates, where they remained vntill the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that the Sunne was risen, deuising within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with what speaches to entertaine king <hi>Butor:</hi> and
when they perceiued the day began to appeare, they knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
at the gates, and desired entrance: but they answered,
that without the kings Maiesties knowledge, he durst
not suffer any man to enter. Then said <hi>Robaster,</hi> goe to
the king and tell him, we haue brought him newes which
will make his Highnesse ioyfull, and at thy returne wee
will giue to thée three pieces of siluer: Thou speakest well
quoth the Porter, and went his way and tolde the King,
who very well remembring the entrance of <hi>Bertran</hi> and

wherefore causing about thirtie of his best appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
Knights to arme themselues, with them he went to

remembred <hi>Robaster,</hi> for that he had afore time
slaine a monstrous Serpent which had greatly wasted his

a squire came and reported that <hi>Brurant</hi> had borne him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner

haires, lamented, and swowned till <hi>Croysant</hi> came and
perswaded him to be appeased: for <hi>Mathaburna</hi> beeing in
the citie there could no mischance befal him, for he knew that
she was Lady and mistresse of the towne, and the proudest
Sarazin durst not disobey her. This gaue some respite to
his mones. Yet he went and threw himselfe vpon his bed,
and would not be fully comforted. In the end hee fell on

so effectually, that his desire was graunted (as you shall

<hi>Drohes</hi> effected all her wish, and in briefe, brought the

with such entirenesse of spirite, that as they had but one
heart, euen so they séemed to haue but one body, vntill
<hi>Drohes</hi> calling Honour from Loues combate, told them

But now it was fitter to thinke vpon the death of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.
Tis true, tis true, said <hi>Meruine,</hi> and then with all

him to <hi>Brurants</hi> chamber, that I may confes him with this

the doore, and said, euen here he sleepeth, if you can open it.
That shall soone be done (said <hi>Meruine</hi>) and then with his

Thine owne mouth shall be thy iudge, said <hi>Meruine,</hi> and
then heauing vppe his mace, hee slue him as he lay, which

many he had confessed in that manner, as he passed through
the countrey. A world madame sayd he, and then hee pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

which refused to be baptized. To be briefe, there was not a

In briefe, after he had conuerted that mother of
cities, he went to performe his vowes, and visite the holie
sepulchre, which also <hi>Mathaburna</hi> did. Thence went they
to Babilon, which he conquered by assault, and caused all
to be baptized. To be short in my discourse, in lesse space
than a yeare and an halfe, he brought to the knowledge of
Christian religion more than an hundred mighty cities, all
which cities he held vnder his gouernement, and from eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them took the expertest souldiers to furnish vp his
hoast, so that now departing from Babylon, he returned to
Montment, and then he imbarked himselfe for France: in

his hoast into thrée battalions, and rode
from ranke to ranke, giuing such incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that like the méeting of long absent
Friends, so was warre welcome into their bosomes. This
while the Pagans like mad men came running, one here,
one there, and another in another place, in such disorder, that
ioyning with the Christians, they were slaine like gnats,
or new borne infants. The crie of them was so horrible,
that it was heard to the campe where <hi>Barant</hi> lay, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
caused euery man to be in a readinesse, but sware,
not to leaue his tents till hee had newes of the Conquest:
but there remained very few to bring tidings, death was so
bitter amongst them. Of all the Pagans, king <hi>Butifart</hi>
was most worthy in armes, and made the greatest slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Christians, till <hi>Drohes</hi> incountring him, at the

his helmet and head downe euen to his téeth. And then
beganhe a second out-crie, which was heard euen vnto the

escaping, the rest slaine or taken prisoners. After this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
<hi>Meruine</hi> called all his army together, and after prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
giuen to God, he commanded them to sit downe and
refresh themselues with victualls: for he vnderstood by one
of his prisoners, that at midnight <hi>Barant</hi> was minded to
giue them new battell. When they had refreshed them
selues, <hi>Meruine</hi> retired himselfe and his army vnto a forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
place, to which there was but a streight and narrow
way for passage: where hauing pitched his tents, he tooke
<hi>Drohes</hi> aside, and saide: The reason why I haue retired

euery thing in execution with great care. During the

<hi>Barant,</hi> thou so extollest to be thus famously renowmed?
I know not answered the Pagan, but I haue heard them

the middest of the day, I will not leaue of all his number
one breathing Christian.</p>
                     <p>2 Then commaunding a trumpet to be sounded, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
sommooned al his host together, and all his elephants,
which were infinite in number, and with them departed
towards <hi>Meruine,</hi> leauing but onely 300. to guard his
Tents and the Emperour, with the other prisoners. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
himselfe marched the last man, and sware by <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
that whosoeuer turned his backe for feare of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
he himselfe would slay him. Briefly to speake, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
at last came where <hi>Meruin</hi> had fortified himselfe with

the entraunce with 20000 souldiers, all on foote; yet
with solempnity protesting, that whosoeuer would enter,
should for his daring presumption forfeit his life for raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.
By this time <hi>Barants</hi> army came and assaulted the
charriots, and turned them ouer and ouer to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
a passage, at last came to the entrance, where <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine</hi>
and <hi>Drohes</hi> were: who made such a slaughter of the
infidels as was hideous to behold. In briefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before the sun
arose, there were 40000 pagans slaine, and not one christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
The sunne being risen, <hi>Meruine</hi> saluted it with great
ioy, causing all his trumpets to sound, remoued thrée char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,
and made way for his army to issue out, incouraging
them so, that he thought himselfe vnworthy to liue, that
aduentured not to die for the honour of so heroicall a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander.
<hi>Mathaburna</hi> all this while was garded by <hi>Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,</hi>
and two thousand Christians, the rest all in a rout
assailed the Pagans, wounding or killing all with whom
they incountred. Now beganne the battell to be extreame
and fearefull, <hi>Meruine</hi> shewing himselfe still vnuanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>Meruine:</hi> 24. he slew ere his lance broke, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more with his sword, all in a moment; he slew also the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:12928:168"/>
king <hi>Orband,</hi> and diuers other kings. Amongst the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
there was a yong Gentleman of Ierusalem, that
with one blow claue a pagan from the head to the téeth;
which <hi>Meruine</hi> seeing laughed at, swearing to make him
a knight, and did so. In briefe, so coragious were the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
that now the pagans stood amazed, and durst not
come neare either <hi>Meruine</hi> or <hi>Drohes,</hi> so dreadfull they
were. All this while <hi>Mathaburna</hi> wore out her time in
praying for the happy estate of her Lord <hi>Meruine;</hi> whose
valor so far extended, that there was not a Pagan of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
left to assaile them, but now began to take flight: the

hauocke of them. At the length (for their safeties) they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
amongst the chariots, but he followed them crying:
Where is the traitor that hath béene the ruine of mine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie?
let him come and trie his fortune with me. And as
he was thus in speaking, he behold <hi>Mathaburna,</hi> whom
kindely he saluted, and saide: Ladie, well met, assure thy
selfe, this day Ile reuenge my selfe and thee of that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous

my loue his prisoner. Thus spake <hi>Barant</hi> that imagined
the Lady had loued him. Shée the poore soule, being in

more than a fearefull amazement to behold her horror so

but in lesse than an houre he slew halfe of them. Of
which <hi>Meruine</hi> being aduertised, with al speed came to the
rescue, saying to <hi>Barant;</hi> Traitour, thou hast forfeited thy
life with too much hardines, and they daring is not pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<hi>Barant</hi> (with stedfast eies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

at what time <hi>Barant</hi> requested <hi>Meruine</hi> to deferre the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

agréed, because that by the meanes of <hi>Mutafier</hi> that then

<hi>Barant</hi> askt the reason of <hi>Mutafier,</hi> why he could not that

offended, for he is the most valiant, wise, resolute and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
champion of the world: and know, if it had not bin

thee, that to morrow thou depart and goe to king <hi>Charles</hi>
and ayde him against the Christians, who haue besiedged
him, and brought him almost to vtter confusion, by the

thou must take battell, and the Lord will be thy defender,
wherefore sée thou depart without any notice to the queene
thy wife, lest she should follow thee, which were offensiue
to the heauens. This sayd, the Angell departed, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<hi>Meruine</hi> arose, and hauing armed himselfe and
gathered his Souldiors together; told his Queene hee
would passe into Surrey, and make a speedie returne:
wherefore he desired her with her little Sonne <hi>Orient</hi> to

Thus he departed with threescore thousand, and made such

consented, and brought him to his Tent, but the King
was not there, onely he found the faire <hi>Beatrice,</hi> who at

How saiest thou? When <hi>Turniquant</hi> heard this resolute

and therefore was now flatly determined by treason to put

since the <hi>Orke</hi> had vaunted himselfe against twentie, that

and accorded, drawing certaine articles touching the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,

he sheathed his sword, and took his great mace, which hung

that he réeled, and with much adoe held himselfe from
falling: when the <hi>Orke</hi> felt these intollerable woundings,
he flew vpon <hi>Meruine</hi> like a tempest, and thinking to hit
him with his diuellish axe, the good horse Passant turned
so nimbly about, that he failed in his purpose, for why there

their shippes, and with all the haste they could, sailed into
their owne countries: all this while <hi>Meruine</hi> assailed the
<hi>Orke,</hi> but by reason of his lying on the ground, hee could

<hi>Passant,</hi> if neede compelled him, to come and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour

said, <hi>Meruine</hi> went towards the <hi>Orke,</hi> and he seeing him
come, bethought himselfe of his best defence; and <hi>Meruine</hi>
imagining to strike him, the false diuellish <hi>Orke</hi> thrust his
axe before him with such violence, that hitting <hi>Meruine</hi>

one blowe vppon the knee, he made him perforce fall to the
ground, which the monster seeing, hee crawled vpon him,
and gaue him many intollerable blowes, whilest <hi>Meruine</hi>
on the other side drawing foorth a puniard, thought to stab
the monster, but lighting vppon his curaces, the dagger
without hurt brake in two peeces. Then <hi>Meruine</hi> implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
some diuine helpe in his succour, for the <hi>Orke</hi> preased
him most extreamely, yet his strength gaue him some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.
Whereas the historie reportes, if there had beene
an hundred besides himselfe, the <hi>Orke</hi> had force to haue

Passant fell vpon his knées, and then hee mounted vpon
him, and neuer staied till he came to Ierusalem, where he
adored the holy sepulchre, and visited all the shrines of the
Saints, remaining there the space of two moneths, at the
end whereof he went into Spaine, to an Abbey that was
