         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
EPISTLE
To all that love our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt in Sincerity.</head>
            <p>IT may poſſibly be a little wondred at, that I ſhould
write at this time any thing upon this Subject,
which may ſeem to revive the Controverſie, of which
little has been written of late Years; it may
therefore ſeem neceſſary I ſhould ſpeak ſomething by way
of Apology for my ſelf. Firſt of all, I muſt tell you,
that this Treatiſe was wrote the laſt Summer, altho it
had no Birth till now, and many know what Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
I had about that time to write in behalf of our
Practice in reſpect of Baptiſm: having heard how a
worthy Miniſter (whom I reſpect and honour) who
liveth not far off from me, had publickly preach'd up the
baptizing of little Babes, bearing very hard upon thoſe
of our Perſwaſion; and could I have had a friendly
Conference with him, 'tis like this had not ſeen the Sun.
Beſides, we were challeng'd to diſpute the Point with
ſome Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> much about
the ſame time, not far from <hi>London:</hi> But tho they
had rendred us as odious as they well could (and as
if we had nothing to ſay for our Practice, <hi>viz.</hi> for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
Men and Women) yet when all came to all, none
of them would appear to defend what they had ſpoken,
<pb facs="tcp:98169:3"/>
which cauſed ſome to conclude it did behove me, or ſome
other to write ſomething about it. Moreover, a godly
Friend (of ſome Eminency in <hi>London</hi>) ſent for me to
his Houſe (who, tho a Baptiſt, yet walks with our
Brethren called Independents) and deſired me that I
would be pleaſed to write a Sheet or two upon Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
chiefly to ſhew what it was, ſith he perceived
many good People were miſtaken therein, and did, as
he conceived, take that to be Baptiſm, or Baptizing,
which was not the thing, he having examined what the
Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Baptizo</hi> did ſignify, and found
by <hi>Lexicons,</hi> and by conferring with Scholars, it did
not ſignify Aſperſion, Sprinkling, nor pouring, nor any
other Waſhing than <hi>Immerſion,</hi> or <hi>total dipping</hi> of
the Body in Water; and therefore did conclude it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
this thing ſhould be further opened, and would
have me to conſer with one able Perſon who well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the Greek Tongue about it, which I was
willing to do: Nay, and beſides all this, when we
wrote our <hi>Key to open Scripture-Metaphors,</hi> we
promiſed the Reader we would write ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this very matter, as you may ſee if you read
<hi>Pag. 38. Part</hi> 2. which, though it be above ſix
Years ago, we never performed till now. All theſe
things conſidered together, with that great Impulſe of
Spirit I found to do it, I thought I had a ſufficient
Call to undertake the Work, altho I know it has been
more effectually managed by far abler Pens ſome Years
ſince, yet I conclude (with others) a ſhort Tract of
a ſmall Price might come into more Hands than bigger
Volumes would do.</p>
            <p>Moreover I muſt confeſs, I have not a little wondred
to ſee ſo many <hi>Eminent Fathers,</hi> and <hi>famous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi>
both <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern,</hi> ſpeaking ſo <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
as to the literal, proper and genuine Signification of
the word <hi>Baptizo,</hi> and yet finding ſo many wiſe and
learned Men of late ſo ſtrangely contradicting themſelves
<pb facs="tcp:98169:3"/>
by their own Practice. I am ſure if Prejudice and
Partiality were laid aſide, and Men would deal faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with their own Conſciences, they muſt confeſs our
Practice of <hi>Immerſion (or dipping Believers</hi> in
Water <hi>in the Name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c.) muſt of
neceſſity be congruous both with the literal and ſpiritual
Signification of the word <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and Practice of the
Apoſtles and Primitive Church; and ſo it will be found
one day, and that they have no juſt cauſe given them to
reproach or charge us as they do: who laying the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of their own Houſe falſe, or not according to the
Patern; and not contented ſo to do neither, but vilifie
and reproach them who build exactly according to the
Direction of the Maſter-Builder: We marvel how they
can ſatisfy themſelves to keep up that Practice of theirs
of <hi>Rantiſm,</hi> ſince there is nothing to be ſaid in the
Defence of it from God's Word; and if once it was
laid aſide (with the wrong Subject) as an unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
Rite, and they would cleave to the Primitive
Inſtitution and Practice, what a glorious Reformation
in point of Church-Conſtitution and Diſcipline would
there be! and what a ſweet Harmony and Vnion
would follow amongſt us! for there has been no one
thing that hath cauſed like Contention in the Church
for many Years, as this of Infants-ſprinkling hath.
If our Brethren would but lay this ſeriouſly to Heart,
I can't but think it would put them to a ſtand or
pauſe about it. It had need lie clear in the Word of
God, ſince ſo great a ſtreſs as the Foundation of their
Church in ſuch an eminent manner (in reſpect of its
Conſtitution) is laid upon it, and it being that main
thing that obſtructs and hinders that bleſſed Vnion and
Fellowſhip amongſt ſo many good Chriſtians as it doth,
who hardly in any other things differ at all in any
Article of Faith or Practice. And whereas our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
ſeem to fly for Refuge to that indirect and remote
Signification of the word <hi>Baptizo</hi> of <hi>waſhing,</hi> yet
<pb facs="tcp:98169:4"/>

Water, that is ſaid to be baptized; for tho all dipping
or baptizing may be called a waſhing, yet all waſhing
is not dipping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a proper ſenſe the word <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,

and ſignifieth primarily ſuch a kind of waſhing

            <p>
               <hi>Ainſworth</hi> upon <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. 5. ſays, to baptize, or

<hi>Hebrews</hi> affirm in every place, <hi>where it is ſaid in
the Law of bathing the Fleſh, and waſhing the
Cloaths of the Unclean, it is not meant but of
baptizing the whole Body,</hi> &amp;c. but if the <hi>Greek</hi>
word would bear ſprinkling or pouring, yet that
will not juſtify Men thus to baptize, becauſe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Vſage of the Primitive Church; nor
doth it anſwer or reach the Signification of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
which is <hi>the Death, Burial, and Reſurrection
of Jeſus Chriſt, together with our Death to Sin,
and riſing with him to walk in newneſs of Life;</hi>
to repreſent which great Myſtery, it was ordained, as
you will find if you read this Treatiſe. I have been
the larger upon this, becauſe if Baptiſm is nothing
leſs, nor more, nor any other Act than Immerſion, or
total dipping the whole Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than abundance of
godly Chriſtians muſt ſeek after true Baptiſm; neither
can Infants, it appears from hence, be the Subjects of
it, ſith their tender Bodies can't bear it in theſe cold
Climates, without palpable danger of their Lives, as
our Oppoſites confeſs, and formerly, by woful Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
found to be ſo. Jeſus Chriſt never appointed an

               </gap>ution,
and exact Rule of the Primitive Church?
Muſt we content our ſelves with that Light which the
Church had in reſpect of this and other Goſpel-Truths
at the beginning of the Reformation,—ſince God
hath brought forth greater (to the praiſe of his own
rich Grace) in our Days? And why ſhould a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Antichriſtian State, be ſo zealouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended?
The Church will never certainly appear in its
Primitive Glory, till this Rubbiſh be remov'd; which is
nothing leſs than to take a Stone of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and lay it
in <hi>Sion</hi> for a Foundation. Beſides, it doth not a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon the Honour of the Lord Jeſus, thus to derogate
from his holy Law, who is appointed Heir of both
Worlds; who hath ſettled in his Church that Religion,
and every Ordinance thereof, which muſt remain unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the end of Time, or Conſummation of all things.
He (as our Annotators well ſay) is the Builder of God's
Houſe, propagating a holy (not a fleſhly) Seed for
himſelf; and hath appointed, and fixed on the Matter
and Form thereof, as ſeemed good in his own ſight,
who is the <hi>brightneſs of the Father's Glory, and
expreſs Image of his Perſon, &amp;c.</hi> And what an
account our Brethren or others will be able to give to him,
for preſuming to do any thing contrary to the Apoſtolical
Conſtitution, when he comes to judg the Quick and
the Dead, I know not.</p>
            <p>As touching that great Argument for Infant-Baptiſm,
taken from the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> tho
ſomething is here ſaid in Anſwer, and enough hath been
ſaid by others formerly, yet I muſt acquaint the Reader,
there is a moſt excellent Treatiſe prepared, written by a
very worthy and judicious Perſon (and ready for a
timely Birth) wherein that grand Objection, and all

            <p>I Having for many Years laſt paſt obſerved
with what ſtrength of Argument ſome
worthy Chriſtians have laboured to defend
the Sacred Ordinance of Baptiſm; and
how they have endeavoured to refine it

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:98169:7"/>
And that I may the more regularly proceed in
this Work, I ſhall endeavour to prove Baptiſm
in Water to be that Baptiſm which is intended
in the Commiſſion; and therefore to abide as an
undoubted and ſtanding Ordinance of the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt until his ſecond Coming, or the End
of the World.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all,<note place="margin">Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt.</note> it may be neceſſary to ſhew you,
that this Ordinance was inſtituted and ordained
by our Lord Jeſus, and given forth by him ſoon
after he roſe from the Dead, and a little before
he aſcended into Heaven; ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 19, 20.
Mark 16. 16. <hi>And Jeſus came, and ſpake unto
them, ſaying, All Power is given unto me in Heaven and
in Earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations,
baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Spirit: Teaching them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
all things that I have commanded you: and lo,
I am with you alway even to the end of the World.</hi>
The Lord Jeſus firſt of all aſſerteth his Power
and Authority. Secondly, he delegates a Power
to his Diſciples. Thirdly, he ſubjoyns a gracious
Promiſe to them.</p>
            <p>1. The Power and Authority which he aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to himſelf is, all Power in Heaven and
Earth; Power to inſtitute and appoint Laws and
Ordinances, how and after what manner God
ought in Goſpel-Times to be worſhipped; Power
to give Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins; Power
to congregate, to teach, and govern his Church
as the ſupream Lord, Head, and Ruler thereof;
yea, and Power to give Eternal Life to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he pleaſeth. This was inherent in him as
God bleſſed for ever, given to him as our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
given to him when he came into the

and manifeſted to be given him at his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

and Aſcenſion into Heaven. And having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared

               </gap> make Diſciples, that muſt be
by preaching the Goſpel to them, inſtructing
them in the Principles of the Chriſtian Faith,
<hi>teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have
commanded you; and lo, I am with you alway to
the end of the World,</hi> that's the Promiſe. Theſe are
the words of the great Commiſſion, which
contains part of the laſt Will and Teſtament of
the ever bleſſed Jeſus, the glorious Teſtator of
the New Covenant, wherein Baptiſm is found
and expreſly given forth, and with as great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and in as ſolemn a manner as ever was
any Precept or Ordinance that we read of in all
the Book of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But 'tis not ſaid, baptize them in Water, it
may therefore intend the Baptiſm of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which we anſwer; As 'tis not ſaid
baptize them with Water, ſo 'tis not ſaid bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
them with the Holy Spirit: They were
commanded to baptize, that's evident; and that
it was Water our Saviour did require them to
baptize with, and not the Spirit, we prove,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the Baptiſm of the Holy Spirit
was never by our Saviour or his Apoſtles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
it was never injoyn'd as a Precept or
Duty to be done, but was always mentioned as
a Promiſe, <hi>He ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt
and with Fire.</hi> And again, <hi>Ye ſhall be baptized
with the Holy Ghoſt not many days hence:</hi> It argues
great Weakneſs, or elſe Wilfulneſs, that Men
should ſee no better how to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Baptiſm that was commanded as a
Duty to be done, and a Baptiſm promiſed,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98169:8"/>
which was never injoyned as a Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It cannot mean the Baptiſm of the
Holy Ghoſt, becauſe the Diſciples of Chriſt
(nor no Man under Heaven) had ever any ſuch
Power delegated or given to them, as to baptize
with the Holy Ghoſt; 'tis ſtrange Perſons ſhould
be ſo blind and bold to think (much leſs to
aſſert) that meer Men can give the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
or adminiſter that Baptiſm, as if the Holy
Ghoſt was at the diſpoſal of the Will of Man,
or that Men know whom to give it to, which
indeed only lies hid in the Breaſt of God
himſelf, who beſtows it to whom and in what
manner he pleaſeth. And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We do affirm from the Authority of
God's Word, that to baptize with the Holy
Spirit is the peculiar Prerogative Royal of Jeſus
Chriſt, and that he did never impower any
Diſciple of his to give it, <hi>He ſhall baptize you with
the Holy Spirit.</hi> The Father by him, and he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
by himſelf in his own Perſon diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
or gives forth of the Spirit according to
the good Pleaſure of his Will, without impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with this Sovereign Prerogative, or pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Power to any other. Now ſince Chriſt's
Diſciples could not baptize with the Spirit, and
yet are commanded to baptize, it follows clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it muſt be Water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Doth not the Apoſtle ſhew that Men had
Power to give the Spirit? what elſe is the meaning of
<hi>theſe words,</hi> he therefore that miniſtreth to you the
Spirit? <hi>it appears that Perſons who preached
miniſtred the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the Spirit is meant the Goſpel, or
Word of Chriſt: as the Law is called <hi>the Letter,</hi>
so is the New Teſtament called <hi>the Miniſtration of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98169:8"/>
the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6. <hi>The words that I ſpeak unto
you, ſaith Chriſt, are Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. Doth God (as
if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay) concur with our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
and give the Spirit to thoſe who hear it,
and help us to work Miracles to confirm it? And
is this done by our preaching the Law, or by the
hearing of Faith, that is, the Word of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Goſpel, ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. or by preaching the
Word of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Baptiſm in the Commiſſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
intend that of the Holy Ghoſt; becauſe the
Spirit's Baptiſm ſignifies the miraculous Effuſion,
or extraordinary Gifts thereof (and not the
saving Influences, Graces, and Operations of it)
which but a few, and thoſe too in the Primitive
Time, did partake of; but the Baptiſm in the
Commiſſion is injoyned on all that are made
Diſciples in all Nations, and in every Age, even
to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It muſt be Water-Baptiſm, becauſe
our Saviour joyneth it with Repentance and
Believing. Now all along in order of Practice
theſe two went together both before this time
and alſo afterwards. You may be ſure had it
been any other Baptiſm, it would never have been
thus joyned together in order of words, with
that Baptiſm that was ſo united in order of
Practice with Repentance and Faith, without the
leaſt intimation of any thing by our Saviour to
the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Becauſe 'tis a Baptiſm that is to be
adminiſtred in the Name of the Father, of the
Son, and Holy Spirit, how can any with the
leaſt ſhadow of Reaſon, ſuppoſe it ſhould be
meant of the Baptiſm of the Holy Spirit, ſith
it is to be adminiſtred in the Name of the Holy
Spirit? Were any ever baptized with the Holy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98169:9"/>
Spirit in the Name of the Father, Son and
Holy Ghoſt? The Spirit was that with which
they were baptized; and therefore not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
in the Name of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The only way further to remove this
Objection, is to obſerve what the practice of the
Diſciples was after the Ascenſion of Chriſt in the
execution of this great Commiſſion: What was
it they baptized with? See <hi>Acts 8. 36. And they
came to a certain Water; and the Eunuch ſaid, See,
here is Water.</hi> Vers. 28. <hi>They went both down into
the Water, and</hi> Philip <hi>baptized him.</hi> Acts 10. 47,
48. <hi>Can any Man forbid Water, that theſe ſhould not
be baptized?—And he commanded them to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> That Baptiſm
which in the Commiſſion the Lord Jeſus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Diſciples to baptiſe with, was the
Baptiſm which they after his Ascenſion did bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
with; and that it was Water the Scriptures
we have now cited do evidently ſhew; certainly
the Apoſtles well underſtood what Baptiſm it
was their bleſſed Maſter did command them to
adminiſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Beſides, were it not the Baptiſm of
Water which was given to them in the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. They did that in his
Name, <hi>i. e.</hi> by his Authority, which they had
no Authority to do, for other Commiſſions they
had not, this being the only place where Water-baptiſm
is mentioned, as being inſtituted and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in Commiſſion to them to adminiſter, and to
all other Diſciples and Miniſters of Chriſt to the
end of the World.<note place="margin">Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Chriſt to the end of the World.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Secondly, that this Holy Ordinance of
Baptiſm doth continue to the end of the World
is evident,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98169:9"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe whatſoever is given forth by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, is given forth by him as he is King,
and Mediator of the New Covenant, and as part
of his laſt Will and Teſtament; and his laſt
Will and Teſtament, I hope, all will grant ſtands
in full force and virtue, and every Part and
Branch of it unalterable to the end of the World:
<hi>Though it be a Man's Covenant,</hi> or Teſtament, <hi>yet
if it be confirmed, no Man diſannulleth, or addeth
thereto</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 3. 15.</note>. How much more dangerous then is it
for any to diſannul, alter, add to, or diminiſh
from the laſt Will and Teſtament of the Lord
Jeſus the Son of God, who received Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the Father what he ſhould ſay and
speak<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 12. 49.</note>; <hi>And was faithful to him that appointed
him, as a Son over his own Houſe</hi>
               <note n="|" place="margin">Heb. 3. 5.</note>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Arguments that Men bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the continuation of Baptiſm, tend to root
out all other Ordinances of the Lord Jeſus as
well as this. Why may they not deny Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to continue, as well as Baptizing, ſince
Teaching is commanded by no other Authority
than this? Are they not both expreſly given forth
and joined together by our Saviour in this his laſt
and great Commiſſion?</p>
            <p>May I not argue thus; If Teaching continues
to the end of the World, Baptiſm continues?
But Teaching none denies to continue, <hi>Ergo</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
continues. Do but obſerve the conjunction
between Teaching and Baptizing in the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>Go, teach all Nations, baptizing them;</hi> and
again, <hi>teaching them,</hi> &amp;c. Baptiſm is fenc'd in
on both ſides, 'tis ſecured, one would think, (as
our Lord Jeſus has placed it) from all Force and
Violence whatſoever; and that ſuch muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
bold as dare attempt to raze it out,
or ſeek to diſannul it, and make it of none
effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:98169:10"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Promiſe that is ſubjoined in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
words, in the Commiſſion, clearly proves
the continuation of this Ordinance; <hi>And lo, I am
with you always to the end of the World;</hi> not to the
end of that Age only as ſome affirm. See our
late Annotators on theſe words,<note place="margin">Continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Pool's</hi> A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <q>I am, and I
will be with you; and thoſe who ſucceed you
in the Work of the Miniſtry, being called of me
thereunto, I will be with you, protecting you
in that Ordinance, and bleſſing you, and all
other my faithful Miniſters, that labour for
making me and my Goſpel known, with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
to the end of the World; not of this Age
only, but till the end of the World—or till
the World ſhall be determined, and the New
Heavens and the New Earth ſhall appear.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The practice of the Apoſtles and
Diſciples of Chriſt, after his Aſcenſion into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
clearly proves, that the Baptiſm of Water
doth continue; for how frivolous is that Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that ſome make againſt it, <hi>viz.</hi> it was to
abide no longer than till the Baptiſm of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
(which ſay they was Chriſt's Baptiſm) took
place, ſeeing it is ſo evident and plain in the <hi>Acts</hi>
of the Apoſtles, and in divers other places, that
it was both taught and practiſed, after that great
Effuſion, or pouring forth of the Holy Spirit,
which was the Baptiſm promiſed, and was firſt
of all made good to the Apoſtles and Saints of
God at <hi>Jeruſalem; When the Day of Pentecoſt was
fully come, and they were all with one accord in one
place</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 2. 1, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 3.</note>; by the help and power of which Spirit
St. <hi>Peter</hi> preached to thoſe Jews that had put
Chriſt to death: At the hearing of which Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
many of them being pricked in their Hearts,
cried out, <hi>What ſhall we do? Then ſaid</hi> Peter,
<hi>Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98169:10"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of Sins, and ye ſhall
receive the Gift of the Holy Spirit.</hi> Now the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
here enjoined on theſe Penitents, could not
be that of the Spirit; for how abſurd would that
render the reading of the words, <hi>Repent, and be
baptized with the Spirit, and ye ſhall receive the Gift
of the Holy Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> But to make it appear yet more fully,
that Baptiſm in Water continued after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Spirit, or great Effuſion of the Holy
Ghoſt, ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 'tis ſaid, <hi>While</hi> Peter <hi>yet
ſpake theſe words, the Holy Ghoſt fell on all them
which heard the Word,</hi> (that was on <hi>Cornelius</hi> and
thoſe with him). <hi>And they of the Circumciſion,
which believed, were aſtoniſhed, as many as came
with</hi> Peter, <hi>becauſe on the Gentiles alſo was poured
out the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Vers. 45. <hi>For they
heard them ſpeak with Tongues, and magnified God.
Then anſwered</hi> Peter, <hi>verſ. 46. Can any Man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
Water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which
have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> vers. 47.
<hi>And he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of
the Lord,</hi> vers. 48. Here the very Perſons who
were baptized with the Holy Spirit, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the Name (that is, by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
of the Lord Jeſus, to be baptized in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and it was a thing that no Man did or ought
to deny to be their indiſpenſable Duty; ſo that
the higheſt Gifts or Endowments of the Holy
Ghoſt, cannot excuſe or exempt any Perſons from
this Bleſſed Ordinance of Baptiſm in Water; and
how bold and daring muſt that Man needs ſeem
to be, who ſhall adventure to ſay, 'tis a low and
carnal thing, and I forbid it to ſuch who have
the Spirit's Baptiſm. I would to God this were
laid to Heart, for ſuch Men are certainly grown
to a great degree of Pride and Arrogance, as

none of Chriſt's,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>S. F</hi>'s Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm before or after Faith.</note> is very ridiculous, and argues
great darkneſs in the underſtanding of theſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers

that this of Water (as well as that of the

part of his laſt Will and Teſtament, to abide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with teaching, believing and repenting
to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>Theſe Men would fain have us believe, that
the Baptiſm of Water was the Baptiſm of
<hi>John</hi>'s, and none of Chriſt's, but as if <hi>John</hi> had
inſtituted it, and not Chriſt, and as if <hi>John</hi> were
the Author of it, and Chriſt the Finiſher; whereas
nothing is more clear that Chriſt, (conſider'd as
God) was the Author, and the firſt that ordained,
appointed and inſtituted it to be adminiſtred by
<hi>John;</hi> and after <hi>John</hi>'s deceaſe, yea, and after
his own Death, and Reſurrection too, gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to its continuance. And for the obſervation
of it amongſt all Nations, our late Annotators
alſo on <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 5. agree with us exactly herein,
<hi>He</hi> (that is, <hi>John) was ſent to baptize in Water; ſo as
from this time</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the Inſtitution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament

            </p>
            <p>Nothing can be more evident, than that the
Baptiſm with Water was Chriſt's Baptiſm; and
howbeit it is called <hi>John</hi>'s, as <hi>John</hi> was the firſt

<hi>For,</hi>

and one would think Men could not be ſo blind to

for the continuation of it, <hi>in the Name of the

Nations to the end of the World: And in regard
alſo that the Apoſtles after Chriſt's Ascenſion into
Heaven preached the ſame Doctrine of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and commanded ſuch who were diſcipled
to be baptized in Water<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 2. 39. &amp; 8. 16. &amp; 10. 47.</note>, in the Name of the
Lord Jeſus, which ſignifies, as we have already
shewed, nothing leſs than according to the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſt, and that glorious Commiſſion
they had received from him.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>John</hi> Baptized only as Chriſt's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and it was from Heaven he received Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to Baptize; and our Lord's Submiſſion to
it himſelf as adminiſtred by <hi>John,</hi> to fulfil all
righteouſneſs, (that is, as one obſerves, the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
of his own Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Goſpel, to be

of his Son in his Obedience herein, by

put an end to theſe fooliſh Objections.</p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt we ſay, owned Water-baptiſm to

by that <hi>Voice from Heaven, ſaying, This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved

               <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 3. 16, 17.</note> And
certainly had not this Ordinance been to abide,
our Saviour would not have given ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
a little before he aſcended into Heaven
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98169:14"/>
for the continuance of it to the World's end.
Nay, if it had been to ceaſe, he would doubtleſs
have given ſome hint of it, and have told his
Diſciples plainly when at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they ſhould
be anointed with Power from on High, they
should go and Preach the Goſpel to all the World,
or make Diſciples of the Nations, but not
baptize them any more, for that the way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Faith, and the Spirit's Baptiſm,
was all the Baptiſm they ſhould teach and inſtruct
the People in. Moreover, had <hi>Peter</hi> known
this to have been the Mind of his Bleſſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
he would doubtleſs have ſaid to them, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.
(when they aſked what they ſhould do?) <hi>Repent,
and believe in Chriſt for the</hi> remiſſion of your
Sins, but in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt be not
baptized in Water never a one of you, as
some while ſince every Penitent was required to
be, for that was a Diſpenſation and Baptiſm of
<hi>John,</hi> and had its time for a while, meerly to
prepare the Way of Chriſt, but now is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
and out of date; ye muſt forſake <hi>John</hi>'s
old Adminiſtration of Water-baptiſm, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a carnal and low thing, and look wholly to a
higher and more ſublime Baptiſm, <hi>i. e.</hi> that of
the Holy Ghoſt: And had he known this to be
the Mind of his Maſter, would not he rather
have ſaid concerning <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and thoſe with
him, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. (inſtead of ſaying, Who can
forbid Water?) Who can require Water, that
theſe Perſons ſhould be Baptized, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Holy Spirit as well as we?</p>
            <p>No doubt had Water-Baptiſm ceaſed, or been
aboliſhed, we ſhould have had ſome diſcovery of
it as well as we have of the Ceaſing of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
and other Rites of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law; for
the Apoſtles, we find, were as ready, and as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98169:14"/>
to make known the Ceſſation of ſuch Rites,
as Carnal Ordinances that were not to abide in the
Church, as they were in eſtabliſhing and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
all thoſe Precepts they knew were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>If therefore, I ſay, Water-Baptiſm muſt not
have remained, or if it were not, according to
Chriſt's Will and Teſtament an inſeparable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of his Doctrine, we ſhould have had ſome
hint or intimation of it, either by Chriſt's own
Mouth, or by the Mouths of his Apoſtles, who
were to deliver and command nothing to Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but what they had received of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
or what was commanded them of the Lord as
concerning the Ceſſation of that Service, or any
Toleration of any one Perſon to omit it, but as we
find it given forth by Chriſt, and practiſed by his
Apoſtles and Primitive Saints, even from the
beginning of it, which was in <hi>John</hi>'s baptizing
in Water. So we find it, <hi>ad jure,</hi> to continue as
part of his Mind and Teſtament, amongſt other
things, not a tittle of which Teſtament is yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated,
nor ſhall, till he come to take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all Men in reſpect of their Obedience
or Diſobedience, as to the preceptory part of his
Will contained therein.</p>
            <p>But furthermore, whereas theſe Objectors ſeem
to intimate, that Jeſus Chriſt was not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or commiſſionated from the Father to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
with Water as <hi>John</hi> was, becauſe 'tis ſaid by
<hi>John, I verily baptize you with Water, but he ſhall
baptize you with the Holy Spirit;</hi> as if Chriſt had
nothing to do to meddle with the Baptiſm of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as any Ordinance of his, or to give any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
about it, or had any more power to diſpence
or enjoin it, than <hi>John</hi> had power to meddle in,
or take upon him to baptize with the Spirit,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98169:15"/>
which peculiarly belong'd to Chriſt, as that of
Water peculiarly belonged to <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To what they ſpeak upon this account, we
muſt ſay, and tell them, that Jeſus Chriſt had
Command and Commiſſion from the Father, as
Mediator, to give forth and enjoin Water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
though he committed the actual Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of it to his Diſciples; for ſith he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to do it, and ſo Baptized, ſaith
an eminent Writer, <hi>per alios</hi> at leaſt, if not <hi>per
ſe;</hi> read <hi>John 3. 22. And after theſe things came
Jeſus and his Diſciples into the Land of</hi> Judea, <hi>and
there he tarried with them, and baptized. And</hi> John
<hi>alſo was baptizing in</hi> Enon <hi>near</hi> Salim, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> vers.
23. Which is more fully explained, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 2.
<hi>When therefore the Lord knew how the Phariſees had
heard that Jeſus made and baptized more Diſciples
than</hi> John, <hi>though Jeſus himſelf baptized not, but his
Diſciples.</hi> Now if he had not received Command
from the Father thus to do, his Teſtimony is not
true; which to ſay, as the ſame Author obſerves,
were Blaſphemy; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ote, what he affirms, <hi>John</hi>
12. <hi>For I have not ſpoken of my ſelf, but the Father
which ſent me, he gave me a Commandment what I
ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak—Whatſoever I ſpeak
therefore, even as the Father ſaid unto, me, ſo I ſpeak.</hi>
Wherefore ſince he did, by the Hands of his
Diſciples, baptize in Water in <hi>Judea,</hi> and made
and baptized more Diſciples than <hi>John,</hi> he did
it by Command from his Father: And indeed 'tis
evident that the People generally flock'd to him
for the Adminiſtration of Water-baptiſm at laſt,
and left <hi>John,</hi> inſomuch as he in his Miniſtry,
even of Water-baptiſm, increaſed, and <hi>John</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
<hi>John</hi> 3. 26, 27. Thoſe words of <hi>John,</hi>
in Anſwer to the Jews, do plainly intimate no
leſs, but that this very thing was intended by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98169:15"/>
thoſe Expreſſions of his, though there might be
more than this meant, <hi>And they came to</hi> John, <hi>and
ſaid unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond</hi>
Jordan, <hi>to whom thou beareſt Witneſs, behold, the
ſame baptizeth, and all Men come to him.</hi> John <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
A Man can receive nothing, except it be given
him from Above.</hi> Vers. 28. <hi>Ye your ſelves bear me
witneſs, that I ſaid, I am not the Chriſt, but I am
ſent before him.—He muſt increaſe, but I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,</hi>
vers. 30. Doth he baptize? as if <hi>John</hi>
should ſay, that is a ſign he is ſent of God: and
do all Men come to him? do they rather go to
him to be baptized than come to me? Why 'tis
no more than what I have told you, <hi>He ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
but I muſt decreaſe;</hi> He and his Miniſtry
muſt and ſhall flouriſh, or increaſe in Honour,
and Dignity, and Reputation in the World; He
is the Riſing Sun, to give you notice of which, I
was but as the Morning Star; He muſt ſhine eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day more and more. I have had my time,
and near finiſhed my Courſe, but do not think
that the Baptiſm of Water ſhall ceaſe with me;
for as he baptizeth, and riſeth more and more
in Eſteem and Honour; ſo he will do, and his
miniſtration of this very Ordinance will increaſe
and be magnified in his Hands, more than it has
been in mine. I hope none will think it abſurd
to underſtand <hi>John</hi>'s words after this manner, for
it muſt neceſſarily be taken in this ſenſe, in any
ſolid underſtanding, <hi>I verily baptize you with Water
only;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>but he ſhall baptize you
alſo with the Holy Spirit.</hi> He is impowred to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe
higher Matters to you than Water only,
with which he baptizeth (as you tell me) as
well as I, though not himſelf, but his Diſciples;
I can go no further than to that outward Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of Water, but he ſhall baptize you
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98169:16"/>
with the Holy Ghoſt. In which words <hi>John</hi> doth
not oppoſe his Baptiſm to the Baptiſm of
Chriſt, as if that which is called his, were none
of Chriſt's, but rather that <hi>John</hi> might magnify
the Perſon of Chriſt above himſelf; as who
should ſay, I can but diſpenſe with the bare
outward Sign, but Chriſt, who though <hi>he came
after me, yet is preferr'd before me,</hi> in whoſe
Name, and not in my own, I baptize, and
whoſe the Baptiſm is that I diſpenſe, and not my
own; he is able, beſides the Sign, to vouchſafe
you the very Thing ſignified.</p>
            <p>The Baptiſm then of Water, in the Name of
Chriſt, together with Repentance from dead
Works, and Faith in his Name, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was
the firſt Miniſter to begin, in which reſpect it
was called ſometimes his; but he left it, after a
while, to Chriſt himſelf and his Diſciples to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on, who all, till Chriſt was actually crucified,
preach'd and practiſed the ſelf-ſame things that
<hi>John</hi> did, as did the Diſciples after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>All the difference between the adminiſtration
of Baptiſm, as diſpenſed by <hi>John</hi> and the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Chriſt, before Chriſt's Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and the Adminiſtration of it afterwards
were only in ſome Circumſtantials; which briefly
take as follows.</p>
            <p>1. The Baptiſm in Water which was Chriſt's,
and of which <hi>John</hi> was but a Miniſter, together
with Chriſt's other Diſciples before Chriſt's
Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was then the Baptiſm of Repentance for
the Remiſſion of Sins by Chriſt, who was to
come, <hi>i. e.</hi> e're long, to ſuffer Death, be buried,
and riſe again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:98169:16"/>
2. But after Chriſt had ſuffered, it is the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
of Repentance, and Faith, for the Remiſſion
of Sins by Chriſt that is already come, hath
died, was buried, and is riſen again for our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification;
they baptized into Chriſt to ſuffer;
now we are baptized into Chriſt who hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
            <p>3. Neither can this ſeem ſtrange to any Man,
ſith the Doctrine which <hi>John,</hi> Chriſt himſelf, and
his Diſciples, preached before our Saviour ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
differed in the ſame reſpect alſo, for they
all then preached Repentance, Faith and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Chriſt, to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>But had <hi>John</hi> lived till Chriſt had ſuffered, he
would have preached Repentance, and Faith, and
adminiſtred Baptiſm as we now do, <hi>viz.</hi> in and
by Chriſt, who hath ſuffered; and this is all the
difference, I ſay, that I know of, (which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
circumſtantial) between the preaching the
Goſpel, and baptizing, before the Death of
Chriſt, and that after his Death; wherefore the
word of the Goſpel under <hi>John,</hi> and after Chriſt's
Death and Reſurrection, is called the very ſame
Word; and the Word that <hi>Peter</hi> preached to
<hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Houſe, is ſaid to begin from
<hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as the ſame Word which <hi>John</hi>
came preaching; ſo that the Baptiſm with which
<hi>John</hi> came baptizing, continues ſtill, and was
preached and practiſed by Command from
Chriſt, by the Mouth of <hi>Peter,</hi> on Diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
in that very place <hi>Acts</hi> 10.<note place="margin">Acts 10. 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41.</note> And this not
in honour of <hi>John,</hi> as ſome frivolouſly affirm,
but as a thing which ought to be done, as in
force a-new from the Lord Jeſus, in whoſe Name
<hi>Peter</hi> adminiſtred it, and not without Warrant
from Chriſt ſo to do; <hi>He commanded them to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
in the Name of the Lord.</hi>

he baptized no more of them than <hi>Criſpus</hi> and
<hi>Gaius,</hi> and the Houſhold of <hi>Stephanus?</hi>

               <hi>Anſw. Paul</hi> cannot mean, Chriſt ſent him not
at all to baptize; or, that the Goſpel he was
commanded to preach, had not Baptiſm enjoyned
to be preached and practiſed, as an inſeparable
Companion of it, (becauſe his Lord and Maſter,
as we have ſhewed, hath joyned Preaching and
Baptizing together in his great Commiſſion)
<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. and ſo to continue to the End
of the World.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Teaching and Baptiſm, Faith and
Baptiſm, Repentance and Baptiſm were always
preached and practiſed together: But he means
this of Baptizing was not his chief buſineſs; nor
did Chriſt require him abſolutely to the actual
diſpenſing of the Ordinance of Baptiſm with his
own Hands, but to preach the Goſpel, in which
Baptiſm as well as Repentance and Faith were
contained, and as a ſacred Ordinance thereof,
which he was ſent to preach as well as any other
Goſpel-Inſtitution, and that he did preach it,
otherwiſe he could not have ſaid as he did,
<hi>Acts</hi> 20. that he had not ſhun'd to declare the
whole Counſel of God, and ſo, that it was done
too by himſelf or ſome other, but it was not in
his Commiſſion, that he muſt adminiſter it in
but his own P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rion; for it is evident, the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
or Act of Baptizing was not tied up to
the Apoſtles, or to the more ordinary Miniſters,
but that any faithful gifted-Diſciples might admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
it as well as they; nor doth the Efficacy of
Baptiſm depend in the leaſt upon the Quality of
the Perſon adminiſtring of it, whether it be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98169:17"/>
               <hi>Paul, Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> or any other Diſciple
much inferiour to them in Capacity or Office,
it is no matter; for <hi>Ananias,</hi> a private Diſciple,
baptized; and <hi>Philip,</hi> who was no other than a
Deacon, or Over-seer of the poor, baptized ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in the City of <hi>Samaria, Act.</hi> 8. ſo that we find
in the Primitive Times the ſimple Act of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
was a Work inferior, ſervile and ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to that of preaching the Goſpel, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Repentance, Faith and Baptiſm in
Chriſt's Name for Remiſſion of Sins, which was
the great Work the Apoſtles were more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
sent to do, yet baptize they ſometimes did,
(when probably it was deſired of them, or when
the Multitudes to be baptized were ſo great that
it required their help with others to do it;) nor
is it rational to believe that <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf and the
eleven did baptize all the three thouſand, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.
without the hands of the 120; though at that
occaſion the Apoſtles might baptize ſome like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
there is no reaſon to doubt.</p>
            <p>When therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, Chriſt ſent him not
to baptize, he intends not, that that Ordinance
was none of thoſe things he had in Commiſſion
to meddle with (for had it been ſo, he went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his Commiſſion in baptizing thoſe few he
did baptize with his own Hands, which were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
to think, ſith he was ſo faithful a Servant
of Jeſus Chriſt, and poſitively affirms, that he
<hi>would not dare to ſpeak of any of thoſe things which
Chriſt had not wrought by him) to make the Gentiles
obedient by Word or Deed:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 18.</note> The words [not ſent]
do not import not at all, as appears by theſe
Scriptures, <hi>John 6. 27. 1. Tim. 2. 14. Epheſ.</hi> 6. 12.
therefore he muſt mean not chiefly, or only ſent
to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel; or not
sent perſonally to do it, as I might further
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98169:18"/>
make appear in reſpect of Chriſt himſelf, who,
as Mediator of the New Teſtament, (as hath
been proved) received Command from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to baptize; but yet in the like ſenſe it
might be ſaid, he was not commanded to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,
<hi>i. e.</hi> perſonally to diſpenſe the Ordinance
himſelf, for had he received ſuch a Commiſſion,
he had not fulfilled it; for howbeit, it is ſaid
he baptized more Diſciples than <hi>John,</hi> yet he
himſelf diſpenſed Baptiſm to none with his own
Hands, <hi>John</hi> 4. 1, 2. but by the Hands of his
Diſciples.</p>
            <p>If what we have ſaid here in Anſwer to this
Objection were well conſidered, it will appear
to confute ſuch who object againſt the practice
of Baptiſm, for want of a due and lawful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
or Adminiſtrator, indued with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Call and Power to work Miracles.</p>
            <p>Sith the Act of baptizing is a more inferior
thing than that of preaching the Goſpel, and
that any gifted Diſciple may baptize; all that is
recorded of <hi>Ananias</hi>'s fitneſs or qualification
(who baptized <hi>Paul</hi>) is, that he was a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Acts 9. 10. And there was a certain Diſciple at</hi>
Damaſcus <hi>named</hi> Ananias; and there is no cauſe
to doubt but many ſuch Diſciples were imploied
in baptizing thoſe 3000 converted by <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. ſo that there is no reaſon to tie
up this Adminiſtration to ordinary Miniſters or
Paſtors of Churches, much leſs to the great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
or ſuch who have an extraordinary
Miſſion, ſith <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he was not ſent to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,
intimating, as you heard, that that work
was not limited to the Apoſtolical Office, or
that it muſt be done by Men extraordinarily
qualified and called forth, and none elſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:98169:18"/>
Moreover, whereas 'tis ſaid by ſome, that he
who takes upon him to baptize, ought to have
Power to work Miracles as the Apoſtles did;
this ſeems very ſtrange, ſeeing the Text ſaith
expreſly,<note place="margin">Joh. 10. 41.</note> that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, the firſt and moſt
eminent Baptizer, did no Miracle, yet the
People made no Objection againſt him, or his
Power to baptize notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But had not <hi>John</hi> an expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to baptize?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That his Baptiſm was from Heaven, or
that he did receive Command to baptize, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
yet we read not when or how he received
such Commiſſion; but let his Commiſſion be
what it would, and never ſo full, it could not be
fuller or more plain than the Commiſſion we
have leſt us Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.
<hi>Go, teach all Nations, baptizing them—and lo,
I am with you always, to the end of the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as this Commiſſion authorizes the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Jeſus Chriſt to preach to the end of the
World, ſo it equally impowers them to baptize;
and the ſame Argument that is brought againſt
baptizing, <hi>viz.</hi> not having an extraordinary Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
holds as ſtrong againſt Preaching, and the
practice of all Ordinances whatſoever as well
as that; therefore how dangerous a thing is it
for any to plead for the non-continuance of
Baptiſm in the Church, or to ſay it ceaſed when
the extraordinary Gifts ceaſed, ſith there is no
other Commiſſion that injoyns Chriſt's Diſciples
to preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that which as well injoyns
them to baptize thoſe who are diſcipled by the
Word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſince the practice of Baptiſm
in Water was loſt in the Apoſtacy, how could
it be reſtored again without a new Miſſion?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98169:19"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That makes againſt the Reſtoration of
other Goſpel-Ordinances. which were loſt as
well as Baptiſm, in reſpect of the Purity of
them, as practiſed in the Primitive Times:
But as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had loſt for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years the Ordinance of <hi>the Feaſt of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neh. 8. 14, 15.</note> yet by reading in the Book of the Law
there was ſuch a thing required, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
revived it and did as they found it
written without any new Miſſion, or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Prophet to authorize them ſo to do;
even ſo ought we to act, God's Word being

<hi>Luke 11. 38. Heb. 9. 10. Mark</hi> 7. 4. And we
dare modeſtly aſſert, that no Greek Author of

Neither is there one Scripture wherein the word

               </gap>, <hi>Baptizo,</hi> is rendred <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> or uſed
to ſignify ſuch a thing as Sprinkling. This being
so, and certainly ſo it is; How ſtrangely hath
the World, and many Godly Chriſtians, been
deceived, thinking they have been Baptized,
when in truth they never were to this day, but
only <hi>Rantized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have had many long and tedious Diſputes,
and perplex'd Controverſies, about the true.
Form or Manner of Baptizing, whereas the thing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98169:20"/>
in difference, is properly not the Manner or
Form of Baptizing, but what Baptiſm is; for, as
one obſerves, A Man may ride many ways, <hi>viz.</hi>
Eaſt, Weſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> backward, forward, apace,
or ſlowly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet all this is riding ſtill, whilſt
the Man moves to and fro on Horſe-back, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the very formality of that Action of riding,
conſiſts is being carried by a Beaſt; but while he
moves upon his own Legs up and down, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
at that time denominate him riding. In
like manner a Man may be <hi>Baptized [Anglicè,
Dipped]</hi> or put under the Water many ways,
<hi>viz.</hi> forward, backward, ſideway, towards the
right Hand or Left, with a quick or ſlow Motion,
and yet all the while be Baptized; if he is put
under the Water, for in ſuch reſpect the Form or
manner of Baptizing, <hi>i.e.</hi> Dipping, doth conſiſt:
the manner of Baptizing is one thing, and the
manner of Rantizing is another: Sprinkling is
Sprinkling, let it be done how you pleaſe, but
it never was, nor never will be Baptizing.</p>
            <p>And that Baptiſm is any thing elſe than Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
or Waſhing, which is by plunging or dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
we do utterly deny; for as the cutting off
a little bit of the Foreſkin of the Fleſh, and
not the twentieth part round, is not Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;<note place="margin">Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the fore-Skin round about quite off.</note>
so ſprinkling a little Water on the Face is
not Baptiſm: As it would be ridiculous, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

and ridiculous to call Sprinkling, Baptizing.</p>

notes it, for the Greeks wanted not other

words to expreſs any other Act beſides Dipping,
if the Inſtitution could bear it. What reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of the Burial and Reſurrection of Chriſt
is in Sprinkling? All Antiquity and Scripture
confirm, that it was Dipping.</p>

Dr. <hi>Du-Veil,</hi> it was ordered that the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
should take heed, that when they adminiſtred
the Sacrament of Baptiſm, they ſhould not do
it by pouring Water, but always by plunging, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

who was plunged in the Waters of <hi>Jordan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Learned Author affirms, this was

               </note> ſee what they ſay
on <hi>Mat. 3. 6. A great part of thoſe who went out to

and on <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. ſay they, <hi>it is true, the firſt

read <hi>John</hi> the Dipper; and for he baptized
them, <hi>he dipp'd them.</hi> Why our Tranſlators, who
have been ſo faithful and exact generally in all
things (as is acknowledged by all Learned Godly
Men in the tranſlating the holy Bible) ſhould
leave the word Baptiſm (it being a Greek
Word) and not tranſlate it into our Language, as
the <hi>Dutch</hi> have done into theirs, I know not,
unleſs it were to favour their own Practice of

            <head>CHAP. III. Proving that Baptiſm is dipping, plunging,
and covering the Body all over in
Water from the Practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Times.</head>
            <p>CErtainly no better courſe or way in the
next place we can take to find out what
Baptiſm is, than to examine the Scripture, and
see what the thing was which the Saints practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Primitive Time, where we read they
did baptize, or were baptized: for as the Jews
in Circumciſion all along were to practiſe that
Rite, as it was commanded, and practiſed by
<hi>Abraham;</hi> and keep the Paſſeover as it was given
to them from the Lord by <hi>Moſes,</hi> together with
all other Ordinances and Services whatſoever,
it behoved them to obſerve the firſt or Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Inſtitution and Practice of every particular
Duty, and were not to derogate from thence
in any thing whatſoever; and for their adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98169:23"/>
any of the Ordinances of God, they
brought themſelves under the Wrath of God,
and many heavy Judgments from him, as the
Old Teſtament doth ſufficiently witneſs; ſo it
behoveth us, I ſay, to ſee to the firſt or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Inſtitution and Practice of Baptiſm in the
Goſpel-Time, that being a Pattern or Rule to
us, and to all Chriſtians to the end of the World,
in reſpect of every Goſpel-Ordinance; and if
we derogate from that Rule, we muſt expect to
meet with ſharp Rebuke from the Almighty firſt
or laſt. Now that that Ordinance which is called
Baptiſm, is Immerſion, Dipping, or Plunging into
Water, will appear, if we obſerve the Practice
of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, who was the firſt that was
sent by Chriſt to baptize; read <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 6. he
'tis poſitively ſaid baptized in a River, <hi>viz.</hi> in
the River <hi>Jordan.</hi>

            <p>Moreover 'tis ſaid that <hi>John was baptizing in</hi>
Aenon <hi>near</hi> Salim;<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 23.</note> the Reaſon is given, <hi>becauſe
there was much Water.</hi> Now if it had not been
dipping or covering the Body in Water, this
could be no reaſon, for a little Water would
have ſerved to ſprinkle thouſands, as <hi>Cornelius
à Lapide</hi> notes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Piſcator</hi> on this Paſſage ſaith,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Goſnold's</hi> Doctrine of Baptiſm, <hi>pag.</hi> 20.</note> that Baptiſm was
dipping the Body in Water.</p>
            <p>Alſo our late Annotators<note n="*" place="margin">Pool'<hi>s Annot. on</hi> Joh. 3. 23.</note> upon the place ſay
thus, <hi>viz. It is from hence apparent, that both Chriſt
and</hi> John <hi>baptized by dipping the Body in the Water,
elſe they need not have ſought places where had been
a great plenty of Water.</hi> They ſay well, and leſs
they could not ſpeak unleſs they would ſtifle
their Conſciences, or offer Violence to their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98169:24"/>
Reaſon: but if they had from hence ſaid, it is
apparent that Chriſt and <hi>John Baptized,</hi> and not
<hi>Rantized</hi> Perſons, they had come off better, and
had undeceived the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis ſaid when our bleſſed Saviour
was baptized by <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 16.</note> he went up
straightway out of the Water,<note place="margin">Acts 8. 38, 39.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi>
and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> 'tis ſaid went both down into
the Water, and that they came up out of the
Water.</p>
            <p>The Aſſembly in their Annotations on this
Text, ſay, they were wont to dip the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and <hi>Piſcator</hi> on the place (as I find him
quoted by a worthy Divine) ſaith, the ancient
manner of Baptiſm was that the whole Body
was dipp'd into the Water.</p>
            <p>Certainly it had been a vain and weak thing
for them to have gone down into the River to
be ſprinkled with a little Water.</p>
            <p>There is no ground to think they would ever
have done ſo, if Sprinkling or Rantiſm had been
the Ordinance required of them, the manner
was not to apply Water to the Subject, as ſome
do, but the Subject to (nay into) the Water.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 9. 'Tis ſaid, Jeſus was baptized
of <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan:</hi> Now, ſaith one on this place,
it had been non-senſe for <hi>Mark</hi> to ſay that Jeſus
was baptized in <hi>Jordan,</hi> if it had been ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
becauſe the Greek reads it into <hi>Jordan,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, could Jeſus be ſaid to be
sprinkled into <hi>Jordan?</hi> 'tis proper to ſay he was
baptiz'd, that is, dipp'd into <hi>Jordan,</hi> and that
was the Act and nothing elſe, as all the Learned
acknowledg.</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Philip</hi> needed not to have put that
noble Perſon, who was a Man of great Authority
under <hi>Candace</hi> Queen of the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> to the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98169:24"/>
trouble to come out of his Chariot (if Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
had been Baptiſm) and to go into the
Water and dip him; or if Sprinkling might have
done as well as Dipping, ſure <hi>Philp</hi> would on
this occaſion have diſpenſed with Immerſion,
and let Rantiſm have ſerved, conſidering he was
a great Man and on a Journey; he might have
fetch'd a little Water in his hand and have
ſprinkled him in the Chariot. But as <hi>Philip</hi>
had preach'd Baptiſm to him, ſo there is like
ground to think that the <hi>Eunuch</hi> very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
what it was, and readily ſubmitted to
it; but if Sprinkling would not excuſe them, I
know not how any Chriſtian can think it may
excuſe us in theſe days; we have no Reaſon to
think Chriſt Jeſus, or his Apoſtles, did do or
teach any thing in vain, yet ſo we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
if he went into a River to receive no more
than Sprinkling; and ſo we muſt think of <hi>Philip</hi>
and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, here I cannot well omit that
which Mr. <hi>Daniel Rogers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

<hi>the waſhing of Hands, Veſſels, Cups, Pots, and
Beds,</hi> &amp;c. and there VVaſhings are called Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, and what then, for, ſaith Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi>
to baptize, is to dip or plunge primarily, and
ſignifies ſuch a waſhing as is uſed in Bucks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Linnen is plunged and dip'd; and thus they
waſh'd their Veſſels, Hands, and Cups, <hi>viz.</hi> they
swilled, rinſed, cleanſed, and totally waſhed,
dip'd, or wetted them all over with VVater, or
elſe you may be ſure it could never be ſaid they
baptized them. But, Sirs, who-ever waſhes
Hands, Cups, Pots, or Beds, by ſprinkling a
few Drops of VVater upon them? there is
no waſhing by ſuch a kind of Sprinkling. O
that you would give over ſuch Arguing, ſince
the practice of Baptiſm in the Primitive Times
doth, as you have heard, evidently ſhew that
the Baptized were always dipped all over in
VVater; Certainly 'tis no Baptiſm at all, if not
so adminiſtred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Doth it follow that we muſt Baptize
so now? That was in a hot Country; but we
live in a cool Climate, and when Children were
Dipt, ſome of them died; and <hi>God will have
Mercy, not Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Ought you not to make God's VVord
your Rule? Have you a Diſpenſation to make the
Commandments of God void by your Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
VVe conclude, the Inſtitution of Chriſt
and the Practice of the Primitive Church, ought
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98169:26"/>
to be followed in all things as near as we can. But
you ſay this is a cold Climate: Pray, Sirs, did
not Chriſt, when he gave forth his Commiſſion
to his Apoſtles, to teach and make Diſciples,
and Baptize, bid them go into all the World,
and into all Nations? VVere they not to go into
cold Countries as well as Hot? And, were they
not to teach the ſame Doctrine, and adminiſter
the ſame Ordinances alike where-ever they
come? Or, did he tell them they ſhould <hi>Baptize</hi>
thoſe in hot Countries that were Diſciples, and
<hi>Rantize</hi> ſuch who received the Word in cold
Countries? Unleſs you can prove this, I am ſure
all you ſay is nothing.</p>
            <p>Certainly you were as good never pretend
to Baptize, but wholly deny it, and caſt it off as
a low and carnal Thing, as ſome do, as to do
another thing in the room of it, which Chriſt
never commanded, and call it his Ordinance;
Which we do declare and teſtify, by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of God's VVord, and a great Cloud of VVit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
who all underſtand the Greek Tongue,
(may be better than ſome of you do) that 'tis
no Baptiſm at all, but a thing of Man's deviſing
brought in, in the room of Chriſt's Baptiſm, and
unjuſtly fathered upon him.</p>
            <p>Sirs, How dare you, <hi>In the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſay, <hi>I Baptize thee,</hi> &amp;c.
when you do but <hi>Rantize</hi> the Perſon? for you
neither dip the Perſon, nor waſh him. Has the
Holy Trinity given you any Authority ſo to do?
For God's ſake, for time to come, uſe the Names
of thoſe Perſons by whoſe Authority it was firſt
set on foot and given forth, till you can ſhew
you have Authority from Jeſus Chriſt to ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle,
or pour a little VVater upon the Face of a
poor Infant, or an adult Perſon. Nor is it any
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98169:27"/>
marvel, when they did dip poor Children in
VVater, that ſome of them died, ſith they are
not the true Subjects of Baptiſm; if they had,
no doubt God would have preſerved them, as
well as he did thoſe Babes whom once he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be Circumciſed. Can any believe
God would command any ſuch thing to be done,
that ſhould endanger the Life of a Child? that
was doubtleſs a juſt Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uke for the prophanation
of Chriſt's bleſſed Ordinance; he will one day, I
fear, ſay, <hi>Who hath required this at your hands?</hi>
Nay, and who knows what Judgments and
VVrath may come upon this Land for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
abuſe of the Sacred Inſtitution of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.
God many times ſhews Men their Sin, by
the puniſhment he brings upon them, if you are
so fond of Humane Traditions and Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But why muſt the whole Body be
dipp'd? may not the Head be ſufficient, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the principal Part?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I muſt confeſs, in a late Diſcourſe I had
with a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he
pleaded for this, ſeeing he could not defend <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi>
But to give a direct Anſwer, pray conſider
whether it be the Perſon, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
or part of the Perſon that Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be baptized; if not the whole Body,
why might it not ſerve only to waſh or dip the
Hands? But if it were the Hands only, or the
Feet, or the Head only that was to be Baptized,
<hi>i. e.</hi> dipped, a ſmall Veſſel of Water would have
ſerved, and no need for <hi>Chriſt</hi> or <hi>John</hi> to have
gone into Rivers and Places where there was
much VVater, to baptize.</p>
            <p>2. It is not ſaid, <hi>John</hi> baptized <hi>him, i. e.</hi> our
bleſſed Saviour, not part of him: But as the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98169:27"/>
Virgin bore <hi>him</hi> in her VVomb, and brought
<hi>him</hi> forth, and laid <hi>him</hi> in a Manger; ſo <hi>John</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
or dipped <hi>him,</hi> that is, <hi>his whole Body</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Jordan,</hi> or in the River <hi>Jordan.</hi> Moreover,
'tis ſaid, <hi>Acts 8. 12. They were baptized, both Men
and Women,</hi> (that is, the Bodies, the whole Bodies
of thoſe Men and Women) and not ſome Part
or Members of them: If this be not granted,
we ſhall be run into many ſtrange Abſurdities al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every where in reading the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>3. To put this out of doubt, 'tis evident the
whole Body ought to be dipp'd or baptiz'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
(as we ſhall ſhew in the next Chapter)
Baptiſm is a Figure of the Burial and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Jeſus Chriſt, nay, called <hi>a Burial.</hi>
Now a Perſon is not ſaid to be buried, that is
not totally covered in the Earth; no more can a
Man be ſaid to be baptiz'd, except he be covered
all over in the VVater.</p>
            <p>4. VVe have ſhewed how all the Learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and poſitively aſſert, that Baptiſm was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
in the Primitive Times, by a total
dipping the Body in VVater. And indeed at
firſt, when this Innovation of <hi>Rantiſm</hi> came in,
they uſed to ſprinkle the Body all over, being
sure it was not one Part, but the whole Body
that was to be baptized, and ſo they Rantiz'd
the whole Body. But you are gone here too,
for you in (your Practice, and in your own Senſe)
Baptize but the Face only; ſo that all your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are unbaptized Perſons, as evident as any
thing can be, take it how you will, if it ſhould
be granted. I mean, that Sprinkling is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>

            <p>TO make it appear yet more fully, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
is not ſprinkling, pouring, nor any
other thing, than dipping, plunging, or cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Body in VVater, we ſhall proceed to
examine what it was ordained for by our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, to hold forth, or to be a Sign or
Repreſentation of; for like as in the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Supper, it behoveth us to know,
what the breaking of the Bread, and pouring
forth of the VVine ſignifies, or are Figures of;
so in like manner we ought (with as great care)
to endeavour to know what is held forth, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to us, as the Holy Signs of the Bleſſed
Sacrament of Baptiſm; for as all true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
readily do confeſs and agree with us, that the
Ordinance of the Lord's Supper is not, cannot
be rightly nor truly adminiſtred, if the great
Ends and Deſign of Jeſus Chriſt, in the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, are not anſwered thereby, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what
it was ordained and appointed to ſignify, plainly
held forth and repreſented in its adminiſtration;
but it is contrarywiſe a great abuſe and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98169:28"/>
of it; and from hence we, and all true
Proteſtants, always ſay, Let us keep to the exact
words of the Inſtitution, and manner of its firſt
Celebration, that ſo the great Things ſignified,
both by the breaking the Bread, and pouring
forth the VVine, may clearly appear, and be
repreſented in the Adminiſtration thereof.</p>
            <p>Now then, this is that which we affirm, <hi>viz.</hi>
That as the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was
ordained to hold forth the breaking of Chriſt's
Body, and the pouring forth of his Blood; So
in like manner the Sacrament of Baptiſm was
inſtituted and appointed, to hold forth Chriſt
was really dead, buried, and that he aroſe again
for our Juſtification. And that this is ſo, we
shall not only prove it from the plain Authority
of God's VVord, but by the joint Teſtimony of
almoſt all famous VVriters and Divines we have
met with, Ancient or Modern. And indeed we
cannot but be much affected with the great Love
and Goodneſs of our Bleſſed Saviour in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of theſe two great Ordinances, it being
his gracious Deſign and Condeſcention, hereby
to hold forth, or preach, as I may ſay, to the
very ſight of our viſible Eyes by theſe fit and
proper Mediums, the glorious Doctrine of his
Death, Burial, and Reſurrection, which in the
Miniſtration of the VVord, is preached or held
forth to the hearing of our Ears, that ſo we
might the better and more effectually be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
and grounded in the ſure and ſtedfaſt
belief thereof; which is indeed abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to Salvation, as the Apoſtle doth plainly
teſtify, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 1. 2, 3, 4. Moreover, Brethren,
I declare unto you the Goſpel which I preached unto
you, which alſo you received, and wherein you
ſtand,</hi> vers. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:98169:29"/>
By which alſo you are ſaved, if you keep in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
what I preached unto you, unleſs ye have believed
in vain, <hi>vers.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>For I delivered unto you firſt of all, that which I
alſo received, how Chriſt died for our Sins, according
to the Scripture, <hi>vers.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>And that he was buried, and that he roſe again the
third day according to the Scriptures, <hi>vers.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>This being ſo, let none blame us for contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so earneſtly for this Ordinance according to
the Primitive Purity, or its Original Glory,
wherein, according to the gracious Deſign of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt we daily receive, in beholding the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of this Sacrament, (as well as in the
<hi>Lord's Supper</hi> what is repreſented to us) ſuch a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
eſtabliſhment in the Truth of the Doctrine of
Chriſt's Death, Burial, and Reſurrection, as well as
in many other Reſpects, the Profit and Use appears
to us, no Ordinance being more ſignificant, or
ordained upon more weighty and glorious Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
and Deſigns: for certainly, if we conſider
the grand Errors and Hereſies of the preſent
Age, ſo boldly maintain'd amongſt us, (by thoſe
deceived People who cry up <hi>the Light within</hi> to
be the True Chriſt; or that the Light or Power
in that Perſon, called <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> diſtinct
and apart from the Body that was Crucified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
is all the Chriſt they own) it will clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us how gracious Chriſt was to appoint this
Ordinance, beſides the Word to confirm us in
the Belief, that the True Saviour was a Man, and
that he did die, and was buried, and roſe again,
which we ſee in a Figure repreſented before our
Eyes, in the adminiſtration of this Ordinance,
And that this is ſignified in Baptiſm, we ſhall

Baptiſm, which now ſaves us by Water, that is,
by the aſſiſtance of Water, and is Antitypical
to the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> does not ſignifie the laying
down the Filth of the Fleſh in the Water, but
the Covenant of a good Conſcience towards
God, while we are plung'd in the Water, which
is the true uſe of Water in Baptiſm, thereby
to teſtify our Belief in the Reſurrection of Jeſus
Chriſt; ſo that there is a manifeſt <hi>Antitheſis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe words <hi>by Water,</hi> and <hi>by the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
Nor is the Elegancy of it diſpleaſing. As
if he ſhould ſay, the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> not the Flood,
was a Type of Baptiſm, and Baptiſm was an
Antitype of the Ark, not as Baptiſm is a waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away the Filth of the Fleſh by Water,
wherein it anſwers not at all to the Ark, but as
it is the Covenant of a good Conſcience towards
God by the Reſurrection of Chrſt, in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of which Reſurrection we are ſaved, as they
were ſaved by the Ark of <hi>Noah:</hi> For the Ark
and Baptiſm were both a Type and Figure of
the Reſurrection; ſo that the proper end of
Baptiſm ought not to be underſtood as if it
were a ſign of the waſhing away of Sin, altho
it be thus oftentimes taken metonymically in
the New Teſtament, and by the Fathers, but a
particular ſignal of the Reſurrection by Faith in
the Reſurrection of Chriſt, of which Baptiſm is
a lively and emphatical Figure, as alſo was the
Ark out of which <hi>Noah</hi> returned as from the
Sepulcher to a new Life, and therefore not unapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called by <hi>Philo, the Captain of the new Creature:</hi>
And the Whales Belly out of which <hi>Jonas,</hi> after
a burial of three days, was ſet at liberty: And

all Types of the ſame thing as Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi>
not the waſhing away of Sin, but of the Death
and Reſurrection of Chriſt, and our own; to
which the Apoſtles, the Fathers, the Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
and all Interpreters agree. The thing is
so apparent as not to need any Teſtimonies. But
becauſe there are not a few who do not vulgarly
teach this Doctrine, it will not be ſuperfluous
to produce ſome of theſe innumerable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
that I may not ſeem to ſpeak without
Book; and firſt let us begin with St. <hi>Paul,
Know ye not that ſo many of you that have been

               <hi>if the Dead riſe not at all?</hi>
As if he had ſaid, if there be no Reſurrection,
Why are we baptized? In vain does the Church
uſe the Symbol of Baptiſm if there be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.
The like Teſtimonies frequently
occur among the Fathers—<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ignat.</hi> Epiſt. ad Tral. id Epiſt. ad Philadelp.</note> that believing in
his Death we may be made Partakers of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
by Baptiſm. Baptiſm was given in

Reſurrection; Immerſion is a Repreſentation of
Death and Burial. Innumerable are the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
which might be added. But theſe I
think ſufficient to prove that Baptiſm is an
Image of the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt,
(from hence we acknowledg the Myſtery of
our Religion, his Deity and Humanity) and of
all the Faithful who are baptized in his Faith,
from Death to Sin, to newneſs of Life, which
if they lead in this World, they have a moſt
aſſured hope, that being dead they ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
riſe to Glory with Chriſt:—Which things
if ſo, what Affinity is to be ſeen between a
Burial and a Waſhing, that Chriſtian Baptiſm
should be thought to draw its Original from
Jewiſh Lotions? for if it were true that the end
of our Baptiſm were to ſignify a Waſhing, or
Ablution; or if it were true, that the <hi>Jews</hi> of
old did admit their Children or Proſelytes into
their Church, by the adminiſtration of any
diving, as it is aſſerted by many Learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of late Days; yet to prove that our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
is indeed an Image of Death, and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
not of waſhing, enough hath been
said. Thus far Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbul.</hi>
            </p>

our Brethren, who argue for their Childiſh Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
affirming, Though Dipping was the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
that was practiſed in the Primitive Time;
yet it doth not from thence follow, that Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
is eſſential to Baptiſm; they are the words

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But do you not acknowledg Baptiſm
to ſignify our being waſhed in the Blood of
Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In Anſwer to this, we do ſay, in a
more remote ſenſe, Baptiſm doth hold forth our
being waſhed or bathed in Chriſt's Blood, which
we doubt not but is ſignified in that of <hi>Titus</hi> 3.
5. by the waſhing of Regeneration; and in <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 22. Yet certainly Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbul</hi> is in
the right, <hi>The proper end of Baptiſm,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ought
not to be underſtood, as if it were a Sign of the
waſhing away of Sin, although it be often-times taken
thus Metonymically in the New Teſtament.</hi> This
therefore, we ſay, Waſhing is not at all the main
or principal thing, or ſuch as is immediately, or
primarily, but only remotely, and ſecondarily
signified thereby. But the Death, Burial, and
Reſurrection of Chriſt, which is the Riſe and
Root, the Original and Meritorious Cauſe of all
the Good we partake of, is the principal Thing
signified hereby. But what advantage is it to
you that are only for Rantiſm, for us to own
Waſhing is ſignified by Baptiſm, ſith Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
can, as you uſe it, in no proper manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
Waſhing? But ſuppoſe it did anſwer in
that, yet it cannot be Baptiſm, becauſe it cannot,
nor does it in any reſpect repreſent the Death,
Burial, and Reſurrection of Chriſt; nor our
death to Sin, and riſing again in a Figure, to
walk in newneſs of Life; which Baptiſm we
have ſhewed was appointed to do, and therefore
can be no other but Immerſion, Dipping and
Plunging, or covering the Body in Water, which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98169:33"/>
doth reſemble, and moſt lively hold forth the
Things ſignified thereby to our ſight.</p>
            <p>Yea theſe Matters, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's Death, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
and Reſurrection, are the cardinal or
great Things to be conſidered; for as in the
Lord's Supper remotely many Things may be
signified to us, yet all the Things cannot plainly
be repreſented to our Eyes; but ſuch Things
that are the more immediate Significations of it
are the proper Cauſe of all the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt
Crucified, and our feeding on him by Faith, or
the breaking of his Body, and the pouring forth
of his Blood, are moſt lively ſet forth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to our viſible ſight: So in Baptiſm
likewiſe, the main and more immediate Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
which are the Death, Burial, and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of our Bleſſed Saviour, with our death
unto Sin, and vivification to a new Life, is clearly
reſembled, though the Fruit of his Death, and
Remiſſion of Sin, and Purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

That Baptiſm is a form or way of Burial, and
none but ſuch as are already dead to Sin, or
have repented from dead Works, are to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
            <p>Alſo Learned <hi>Zanchy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zanchy.</note> I find, writes thus on
<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. Of Regeneration, ſaith he, there are
two parts, Mortification and Vivification, that
is called a Burial with Chriſt, this a Reſurrection
with Chriſt; the Sacrament of both theſe, ſaith
he, is Baptiſm, in which we are overwhelmed
or buried, and after that do come forth and riſe
again: It may not be ſaid truly, but ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
of all that are Baptized, that they are
buried with Chriſt, and raiſed with him,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98169:33"/>
but only of ſuch as have true Faith.</p>
            <p>Now we may appeal to all the World, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Zanchy</hi> doth not clearly and evidently teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the ſame thing which we aſſert, <hi>viz.</hi> that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
is and can be no other than Immerſion, or
Dipping, ſith Sprinkling, all muſt confeſs, doth
not repreſent, in a lively Figure, the Burial and
Reſurrection of Chriſt, nor our dying, or being
dead to Sin, and Vivification to Newneſs of Life,
saith he, Sacramentally, <hi>i. e.</hi> Analogically; and
in reſpect of the near Reſemblance, yet truly to
be buried with, and raiſed with Chriſt. This,
we ſay, cannot be ſaid of them that are
sprinkled only; for if in reſpect of Mortification,
and Vivification, they may be denominated, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and raiſed with Chriſt, yet that outward
Rite and Ceremony cannot of it ſelf denominate
them ſo much as Sacramentally buried and raiſed
with Chriſt, for there is not ſo much as any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſuch Things in it. But in true Baptiſm,
<hi>viz</hi> total dipping the Body in Water, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it again, it is in a lively Figure held forth to
our ſight.</p>
            <p>Moreover <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith that the old Man
is buried and drowned in the Immerſion under
Water;<note place="margin">Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom.</note> and when the Baptized Perſon is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
raiſed up from the Water, it repreſents
the Reſurrection of the new Man to newneſs of
Life, and therefore concludes (saith my Author)
that the contrary Cuſtom, being not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Eccleſiaſtical Law, but againſt the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
and Myſtical Signification of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is not to be complied with.</p>
            <p>It has been too long, God grant Men Light
to ſee their Error, and do ſo no more.<note place="margin">Prim. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, <hi>p.</hi> 320.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> ſaith that the Party baptized
was wholly immerged, or put under the Water,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98169:34"/>
which was the almoſt conſtant and univerſal
Cuſtom of thoſe Times, whereby they did moſt
notably and ſignificantly expreſs the great Ends
and Effects of Baptiſm; for, as in immerging
there are in a manner three ſeveral Acts, the
putting the Perſon into the Water, his abiding
under the Water, and his riſing up again, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
repreſenting Chriſt's Death, Burial, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;
and in our Conformity thereunto,
our dying to Sin, the deſtruction of its Power,
and our Reſurrection to a new courſe of Life.
By the Perſon's being put into the Water, was
lively repreſented the putting off the Body of
the Sins of the Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by his being under it,
which is a kind of Burial into Water, his entring
into a ſtate of Death, or Mortification, like as
Chriſt remained for ſome time under the State
or Power of Death; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as are baptized into Chriſt, are baptized into his
Death,</hi> &amp;c. And then, by his Emerſion, or
riſing up out of the Water, is ſignified his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
upon the new courſe of Life; that like

buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm—and further
shews, that the external Act of being buried in
Water in Baptiſm, is a lively Emblem of the
Internal Work of Regeneration.</p>
            <p>This,<note place="margin">Auſtin.</note> ſaith <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> ſpeaking of theſe things,
is by a Sacramental Metonimy, and the meaning
of it is, not that one thing is changed really into
another, but becauſe the Sign doth ſo lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
the thing ſignified.</p>
            <p>Thus all Men may ſee how the Learned
agree with us, that theſe Scriptures do hold forth
Baptiſm to be a lively Reſemblance of Chriſt's
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98169:34"/>
Death, Burial and Reſurrection, and not of the
spiritual things ſignified only, <hi>viz.</hi> our Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

but alſo the outward Rite or Form of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of the Sign it ſelf—to be done in
a way of likeneſs or lively Reſemblance to them
both; ſo that either our Brethren and other
Pedo-Baptiſts muſt deny the Apoſtle ſpeaks here
at all of the Ordinance of Baptiſm, or elſe confeſs
they have no Baptiſm; I mean none of Chriſt's
Sacrament of Baptiſm, their's not anſwering nor
repreſenting any ſuch things that Baptiſm was
appointed to do, and ſtill does among thoſe
Chriſtians and Churches who have it according
to the Primitive Inſtitution reſtored to them,
and practiſed by them.</p>

you what thoſe Metaphorical Baptiſms ſpoken

but that which is vehement and overwhelming, as
there are Waves of Perſecution and Tribulation
mention'd in Scripture; ſo ſuch as are drown'd
and overwhelm'd by them may ſeem in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
way to be baptized; the reaſon of the
Metaphor is taken from many deep Waters to
which Calamities are compared; <hi>He drew me
out of great Waters,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 32. 6.
<hi>I am come into deep Waters where the Floods over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow

spake of his Suffering, who was as it were
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98169:35"/>
drowned, or drenched, or overwhelmed in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,

to a leſſer degree or meaſure of them, being
dipp'd and plunged into Afflictions.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> on the Baptiſm of Affliction renders
it to plunge into Afflictions or Dangers as it were,
saith he, into deep Waters; ſo that it appears
alſo from this Metaphorical Notion of Baptiſm,
to baptize is to dip, or overwhelm, or cover
the Body in Water.<note place="margin">See Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotat. on <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>flictions. I am,
ſaith Chriſt, to be baptized with Blood, overwhelmed
with Sufferings and Afflictions; are you able ſo to
be?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. We read of the Baptiſm of the Holy
Ghoſt and Fire:<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 11. Mark 1. &amp; Luk. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>I indeed baptize you with Water,</hi>
saith <hi>John, but he ſhall baptize you with the Holy
Spirit and with Fire.</hi> Now the Queſtion is, What
we are to underſtand to be meant by the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
of the Holy Ghoſt? whether the ſanctifying
Gifts and Graces of the Spirit are intended
hereby, which all the Godly receive? or thoſe
extraordinary Gifts or miraculous Effuſions of
the Holy Ghoſt only, which many received in
the Primitive Times?</p>
            <p>I know ſome are ready to make uſe of the
Baptiſm of the Spirit to juſtify their Rite of
Sprinkling or Pouring, becauſe God is ſaid
to pour the Spirit upon his People, and to
sprinkle them with clean Water, which we
do grant does intend the Graces of the Holy
Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:98169:36"/>
But certainly if they did conſider the ground
and reaſon why Perſons were ſaid to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
with the Spirit, they would ſoon perceive
this Argument would utterly fail them likewiſe,
or ſtand them in no ſtead.</p>
            <p>For we do affirm that every Believer who
hath the Holy Spirit,<note place="margin">What it is to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the Spirit.</note> cannot be ſaid to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
with the Spirit; like as every one that is
under Afflictions and Sufferings, cannot be ſaid to
be baptized with Sufferings, as we have ſhewed.</p>
            <p>But in the firſt place, it is neceſſary to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the difference between the Baptiſm com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
and the Baptiſm promiſed; the Baptiſm
commanded is that of Water, the Baptiſm pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
was that of the Spirit. Our Saviour

to his Diſciples, to <hi>teach and baptize,</hi> and then

               <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 20</note>

why 'tis expreſt in the fifth Verſe, <hi>Ye ſhall be
baptiz'd with the Holy Ghoſt not many days hence;</hi>
and this was made good to them on the day
of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> Acts 2. 1, 2 3. which was no other
than the Spirit in an extraordinary manner, or
the miraculous Gifts thereof; theſe the Apoſtles
and believing Jews received firſt, and in the
tenth Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> the ſame extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Gifts,<note place="margin">Act. 10. 46.</note> or Baptiſm of the Spirit, the believing

Scriptures; We have here cited, ſaith he, theſe
places diligently compared together, evidently
shew that the Baptiſm of the Spirit is a diſtinct
Baptiſm from that of Water, and hath no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
at all to the inward ſanctifying Graces
of the Spirit; but notes out the moſt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Gifts of the Spirit that ever were given
to the Sons of Men, therefore called the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But yet this Baptiſm however was by
a pouring forth of the Spirit, and why may
not Baptiſm be adminiſtred ſo?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis evident 'twas not by a ſprinkling
or dropping of the Spirit, and therefore no
ways for your turn; and though it was by a
pouring out, or a pouring forth of the Spirit,
yet in ſuch ſort that the Houſe in which they
were is ſaid to be filled, and ſo they immerg'd
or baptized with it: But however, all confeſs
this was but a Metaphorical Baptiſm, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Argument from hence at beſt is but
far fetched, and ſignifies nothing, for 'tis a
strange way to go to the Metaphorical Notion
of a word to prove a Practice that is contrary
to the literal and proper Signification thereof.
Moreover, if this be granted which we have
hinted here, it may ſerve to detect the Error
of ſome Men who own no other Baptiſm than
that of the Spirit, and think that the ordinary
Gifts and Graces of the Spirit is the Baptiſm
of the Spirit, which there is no ground, as I
can ſee, to believe; nor was there any other
Baptiſm to continue to the end of the World,
but that of Water without doubt, ſith the
Baptiſm of the Holy Spirit was given only to
the Apoſtles and Saints in the Primitive Time
for the Confirmation of the Goſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l, as theſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98169:37"/>
Scriptures ſhew, <hi>Mark 16. 16, 17, 18, 20. Heb.</hi>
2. 3, 4. Therefore let ſuch take care who ſay
they have the true Baptiſm, and are baptized
with the Spirit, left they are found Liars, and
to be indeed without any Baptiſm at all; for
though the Saints before that great Effuſion of
the Spirit, nay before Chriſt was manifeſted in
the Fleſh, had the Holy Spirit, and ſome of
them in a glorious manner; yet, as ſome learned
Men obſerve, they were not ſaid to be baptized
with it: ſo likewiſe Believers in theſe days have
the Spirit of Chriſt in the ordinary Gifts and
Graces thereof, yea and the Promiſe of Chriſt
is, that the Bleſſed Spirit the Comforter ſhall
abide with us for ever, yet are not we, nor any
now baptized with it, nor have any (as I
humbly conceive) ſince thoſe miraculous and
extraordinary Gifts ceaſed in the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is another Typical or Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Baptiſm ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
or the Fathers are ſaid to be baptized to
<hi>Moſes</hi> in the Cloud, and in the Sea, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.
Some have of late intimated, That the Rain that
fell from the Cloud, ſprinkled them as they paſt
through the Sea, and from hence would have
Baptiſm to be Sprinkling: Truly, if that was a
Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> it raining upon them, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may ſave their Mony, and never go to Prieſt
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or Miniſter more to Chriſten their Children, for
'tis but to carry them abroad when it rains, and
they will be ſo baptized; and it will be as true a
Baptiſm, no doubt: for the uſing the Name of
<hi>the Father,</hi> &amp;c. doth not make Baptiſm, though
true Baptiſm cann't be warrantably adminiſtred
without mentioning the Names of the Sacred
Trinity. But we muſt conclude, there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe than that which theſe Men ſuppoſe in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98169:38"/>
that Caſe, which cauſed the Apoſtle to ſay, <hi>Our
Fathers were baptized unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>in the Cloud, and
in the Sea.</hi> It was doubtleſs a Type and plain Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of Goſpel-dipping, or burying in Water;
for they were overwhelmed, 'tis evident, as it
were, in the Cloud, and in the Sea.</p>
            <p>And we muſt give our late <hi>Annotators</hi> their
due at this turn alſo,<note place="margin">See Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotat. on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2.</note> for they ſpeak much
the ſenſe of the Spirit of God in that place;
pray take their own words, after they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the ſenſe of divers Learned Men upon the
Text; this they fix upon us to be moſt probably
the meaning of the Scripture; <q>Others, ſay
they, moſt probably think, that the Apoſtle
maketh uſe of this term, in regard of the
great Analogy betwixt Baptiſm, (as it was
then uſed) the Perſons going down into the
Waters, being dipped in them; and the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>
going down into the Sea, the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
of Water, though the Waters at that
time were gathered on heaps on either ſide of
them; yet they ſeemed buried in the Waters,
as Perſons in that Age were when they were
baptized.</q>—A very plain Figure doubtleſs,
they having the Water on each ſide of them;
and to which they might have added, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
Cloud over them, whether it broke down
upon them or no, they were, as it were, buried
in the Cloud and in the Sea; ſo that this Notion
of Typical Baptiſm makes nothing for Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>And thus we hope we have fully evinced, and
clearly proved, to all unbyaſs'd Men, what Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
is you have heard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is immerging, or dipping into the
Water, from the proper, literal, and genuine

            <p>WE having clearly evinced and proved

thoſe who have been only <hi>ſprinkled,</hi> whether as
Children, or Adult, are all Unbaptized Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and will certainly be ſo found in the Day
of the Lord; let their Teachers affirm or ſay

that have made it Circumciſion? And truly, they
might have as good a Plea, no doubt, for ſuch an
Invention, conſidering how dangerous and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
a thing Circumciſion was to little Children,
as the firſt Inventers of Sprinkling a little Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

in changing <hi>Baptiſm</hi> into <hi>Rantiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, in the next place it behoveth us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
who or what kind of Perſons they are,
that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath required to be
baptized; and there is no better way certainly
to know this, than to go to the great Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>Matth. 28 19, 10. All Power,</hi> ſaith Chriſt,
<hi>is given to me in Heaven and Earth. Go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt obſerve, that this Commiſſion was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
forth by Chriſt, juſt as he came out of the
Grave, or roſe from the Dead. Certainly what he
said at other times, ſhould with all care be
minded, he being the Son of God; but much
more now at this time. If God ſhould have ſent
a Saint from the Dead, to let us know what we
should do, would we not give all diligent heed
to him? but much more to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. In the ſecond place, eſpecially conſidering
the Power and Authority he teſtifies the Father
had given to him as <hi>Mediator, viz.</hi> to be Head
and chief Governour of his Church; or King and
Lawgiver in all Spiritual Things and Matters
over the Souls and Conſciences of Men, all
Power to diſpoſe of all things in Heaven and
Earth, or Power over Men and Angels, <hi>i. e.</hi>
Power to make and give forth Laws, Statutes,
and Ordinances, how, and after what manner
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98169:39"/>
God ought by us to be worſhipped in Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,
a Power that is given to him alone, whoſe
Laws and Appointments none have any Power
to diſpenſe with, nor change or alter the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of to the end of the World; <hi>Go ye
therefore, teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. Obſerve what is Antecedent to Baptiſm,
<hi>Teach all Nations;</hi> there muſt be teaching, they
muſt be firſt Taught, or made Diſciples, for the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as is well known and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
by all, doth ſignify, to diſcipulize, or make
Diſciples, and next baptize them. And this
alſo we find was his own practice, firſt to make
Diſciples, and then to baptize them; <hi>John</hi> 4.
1, 2. <hi>Jeſus</hi> ('tis ſaid there) <hi>made and baptized
more Diſciples than</hi> John; it is not rantize them,
and then teach or make Diſciples of them, as
the manner of ſome now-adays is, and for a
long time has been.</p>
            <p>Lord, that ever Men ſhould be ſo bold and
preſumptuous, as once to attempt to alter or
change any thing of this Holy or Great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
or adventure to do Things contrary to
what is given forth here by Jeſus Chriſt, as King
and Law-giver of the New Teſtament. <hi>What
will they ſay when God riſes up? What will they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
him when he viſiteth them?</hi> Job 31. 14.</p>
            <p>4. Note the Extent of the Commiſſion here
given by Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Go teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
baptizing them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 16. 15.</note> Go into all Nations; or, as
<hi>Mark</hi> has it, <hi>Into all the World,</hi> Eaſt as well as

5. Obſerve in whoſe Name they are required
to baptize, <hi>viz. in the Name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; into</hi> the Name, ſo
the Greek: In the Name doth not only import
the naming of the Names of the Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit, but in the Authority, and into
the Profeſſion of the Bleſſed Trinity, of the one
Divine Being, dedicating the Perſons baptized
(saith our Annotators) to God the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghoſt. But how dare any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to <hi>Rantize</hi> a Babe that is uncapable to be
taught or made a Diſciple by teaching? In the
Name of the Glorious Trinity, can they ſay and
prove it, Chriſt hath given them any ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?
I am ſure they have no Warrant nor
Authority ſo to do, from this Bleſſed Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

any one Perſon that received the leaſt Hurt

such who are made Diſciples, <hi>viz.</hi> believing Men

do Chriſt's Work, as Chriſt has required? Is it
neceſſary you ſhould alter any of his Holy Laws,
and make void one of the great Sacraments of
the New Teſtament by your Traditions? I pray,

            <p>From hence it is evident, that thoſe who

mean the manner of the Conſtitution of this
Church, it being the firſt Church that was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Goſpel-days, it was the Church at
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and indeed the Mother-Church; for
evident it is, all other Goſpel-Churches ſprang
at firſt from this, and hence ſome conceive the
Apoſtle calls this Church <hi>Jeruſalem above,</hi>

<hi>the Mother of us all,</hi> ſaid to be above, not only
becauſe ſhe was in her Conſtitution from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

having the firſt Fruits of the extraordinary Gifts
of the Spirit poured out upon them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
having all the great Apoſtles at firſt as
Members with her; and hence 'tis that all other
Churches were to follow the Church of God
that was in <hi>Judea,</hi> and were commended in
so doing, and certainly 'tis the Duty of all

            <p>But to proceed, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. we find <hi>Philip,</hi> being

               </gap>o make them Diſciples,

            <p>That it was ſaving Faith that was required of
the Jews and profeſt by them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. is
plain in the Text.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Samaritans</hi> believed, and had great Joy,

            </p>
            <p>The Condition upon which (saith he) the
<hi>Eunuch</hi> muſt be baptized was, if he believed
with all his Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> was baptized after Converſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 18.</p>
            <p>The Holy Ghoſt fell on the Gentiles before
they were baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 44.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lydia</hi>'s Heart was opened before ſhe was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
and was one the Apoſtle judged faithful,
<hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14.</p>
            <p>So he goes over with all the Scriptures we
have mentioned, proving they were Believers,
and none elſe, that all along in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were baptized; 'tis ſtrange to me that the
Man ſhould have ſuch clear Light and plead
for the Commiſſion, and the Practice of the
Primitive Chriſtians, and yet dare attempt to
sprinkle Children, having neither a Command
from Chriſt, or a Precedent from the Apoſtles
for any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I know 'tis objected Baptiſm was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
only to Believers in the Apoſtles time,
but that was the Infancy of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I am not a little troubled to hear any
Man to argue after this manner; for though it
be granted in the Apoſtles days the Church
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98169:44"/>
was newly conſtituted, and ſo might be ſaid
to be new born; yet to ſay that was the Infancy
of the Church, (as Infancy imports in our
common Acceptation, Weakneſs or Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
is a falſe and fooliſh Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe that was in truth the time of
the Churches greateſt Glory, Perfection and
Beauty, and very ſoon after the Apoſtles fell
aſleep, the Church, though ſhe grew older,
yet ſhe decayed, and Corruptions crept in;
the Church might in that reſpect be compared
to a glorious Flower, that as ſoon as ever it is
blown and quite put forth it is in its Glory,
and let it ſtand a while and it ſoon fades, and
loſes much of its Luſtre and Beauty; even ſo
did the Church of God:<note place="margin">Acts 20.</note> and it was foretold alſo
by the Apoſtles, it would ſo after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
come to paſs, by the entring in of
grievous Wolves who ſhould not ſpare the Flock,
<hi>i. e.</hi> the Church;<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 7.</note> nay, the Spirit of Antichriſt,
(<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,) or <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> did even <hi>then
work</hi> in the Apoſtles days.<note place="margin">1 John 2. 18.</note> And St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks
to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Little Children, it is the laſt
time: and as ye have heard that Antichriſt ſhall
come, even now are there many Antichriſts, whereby
we know that this is the laſt time:</hi> and indeed all
generally believe the Church continued not a
pure Virgin to Chriſt much longer than one
hundred Years after his Death; now then ſhall
any preſume to ſay that was the Infancy of the
Church, as if the Church arrived to clearer
Light, Strength, and Glory in after-Times.</p>
            <p>But, 2. Had not the Goſpel-Church in that
Age the extraordinary Apoſtles with it, like
to whom never any roſe after to ſucceed them;
nay ſuch who were converſant with the Lord
Jeſus after he roſe from the Dead,<note place="margin">Acts 1. 3.</note> and ſpake
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98169:45"/>
to him mouth to mouth,<note place="margin">Act. 10. 41.</note> and did eat and drink
with them? as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>3. Had not the Church then extraordinary
Gifts, nay, ſuch an infallible Spirit and Preſence
of Chriſt with her, that her Sons could clearly
diſcern Spirits, and know when they ſpeak, and
when the Spirit ſpake in them? <hi>Now ſpeak I, not
the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Was not that Church ſet up to be a Patern,
or perfect Copy, after which all ſucceeding
Churches were to write? can we think that
others ever attained to the like, much leſs to
greater Light and Knowledg than they? Theſe
things conſidered, fully ſhew the folly and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this Aſſertion and Objection.</p>
            <p>But if Believers were the only Subjects of
Baptiſm in the Primitive Time, and this was
according to the Commiſſion of Chriſt and
Practice of thoſe days, how came this Order
and Adminiſtration to be altered and changed,
I mean by whoſe Authority? nay, and which is

Adult Perſons were baptized only becauſe they
were before they believed either Jews or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;

their Children had a right to Baptiſm
likewiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is ſoon ſaid, but hardly, nay not
at all to be proved. For it cannot be their
Childrens right without Authority or Command
from Chriſt: for if we ſhould grant all our
Brethren ſay concerning <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and of
their Childrens being in Covenant, this will
not juſtify their Practice of baptizing them, if
they argue thus till Dooms-day, except Chriſt
hath left them a Precept, or his Church a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
so to do; for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, though
they were ſuch a thouſand times over, had no
right to Circumciſion until he received the
word of Command to circumciſe them from
the great God. Nor had <hi>Lot,</hi> and other godly
Men in that day, any right to that Ceremony
who were not of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, becauſe
God limited his Command to himſelf, his Sons,

we are ſaid to be buried and riſen both in Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,
and alſo in lively Repreſentation of
the inward and ſpiritual Burial and Reſurrection
with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is mention made of the Sign,
and of the Thing ſignified. And as for that
which is ſpoken of under this Expreſſion, <hi>Buried
in Baptiſm,</hi> 'tis delivered as a <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dium</hi> (saith
one) whereby, as a Motive whereunto, and
as a Reaſon wherefore, as an Image and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation,
wherein we are both to read,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> and
remember, and alſo practiſe and perform that
other; for, do but mark, <hi>how ſhall we that are
dead to Sin, (i. e.</hi> ſhould be) <hi>live any longer
therein? Know ye not, that as many of you as were
baptized into Chriſt,</hi> i. e. into, or in token of an
Intereſt in him, and of a Oneneſs and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with him by Faith, <hi>are baptized into his
Death?</hi> i.e. in token of ſuch a Communion with
the Power of his Death, as to kill Sin, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
the old Man, ſo <hi>that henceforth we ſhould
not ſerve Sin?</hi> therefore hence it is, ſaith he,
that in Baptiſm, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the outward Sacrament)
we are <hi>buried with him,</hi> i. e. outwardly, viſibly,
bodily in Water <hi>into his Death,</hi> i. e. in token and
reſemblance of our dying unto Sin by virtue of
his Death? That we ſhould be ever practically
mindful of this, <hi>That like as Chriſt roſe again</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:98169:47"/>
after he was dead, <hi>ſo we ſhould riſe to a new
Life; for if we have been planted together in the
likeneſs of his Death,</hi> (i. e. ſignally in outward
Baptiſm, ſpiritually, and really in the inward
Work of Death unto Sin, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> performed by the
Spirit upon the Soul) <hi>we ſhall be alſo in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Reſurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Burial and Reſurrection that is
immediately expreſſed by theſe words, <hi>Buried
with him in Baptiſm, wherein ye are alſo riſen with
him,</hi> is made a Motive, Argument, and Incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the ſpiritual Death and Reſurrection;
for therefore are we perſwaded to die to Sin
and live righteouſly, becauſe in Baptiſm we are
buried in Water, and raiſed again, in token that
we ought ſo to do; and to this end are we
baptized, and buried, and raiſed therein, and
so intereſted into all the other Benefits of
Chriſt's Death, Remiſſion of Sins, and Salvation,
<hi>viz.</hi> that we ſhould die to Sin and live holily,
and to the end alſo that we may thereby be
put in mind ſo to do.</p>
            <p>Now if this Death and Burial in Baptiſm be
to this end, <hi>viz.</hi> to teach us, and ſhew us how
we muſt die to Sin: Then I infer two things,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the burial in Baptiſm, here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, is not the Death to Sin; for the Motive,
and things we are moved to do, are two; and ſo
are the Sign, and the Thing ſignified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Infants are not capable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Baptiſm: for this Sacrament calls for
Underſtanding, and Judgment, and Senſes to be
exerciſed in all that partake thereof, or elſe the
whole work will be altogether inſignificant.
Therefore, ſaith one, to carry a poor Babe to
Baptiſm, is as much as to carry it to hear a
Sermon.—A Sign,<note place="margin">Pareus.</note> as <hi>Pareus</hi> obſerveth, is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98169:47"/>
some outward thing appearing to the Sense,
through, which ſome inward thing is at the
same time apprehended by the Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Therefore, ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Perkins</hi> Caſe of Conſc. <hi>p.</hi> 177.</note> the preaching
of the Word, and the adminiſtration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are all one in ſubſtance; for in the one the
Witneſs of God is ſeen, and in the other heard.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another end of Baptiſm is, that it
might be a ſignal Repreſentation of a Believers
Union with Chriſt, hence called a being baptized
into Chriſt, and a putting on of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As many as have been baptized into Chriſt, have
put on Chriſt, and are all one in Chriſt Jeſus,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baxter</hi> on Confirm. p. 32.</note> 
               <hi>saith
Mr.</hi> Baxter, and are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and Heirs
according to Promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27, 28, 29.</p>
            <p>This ſpeaks the Apoſtle of the probability
grounded on a credible Profeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And further, ſaith he,</hi> our Baptiſm is the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing
of our Marriage with Chriſt, and 'tis a
new and ſtrange kind of Marriage where there is no
Profeſſion of Conſent.</p>
            <p>Now if this be true which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> affirms,
and I ſee no cauſe to doubt of it; (moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Men, as well as Scripture, agreeing in this
caſe with him) how abſurd and ridiculous a
thing is the Invention of Infant-Baptiſm, ſith all
Men know they are not capable to ſignify their
Conſent of Marriage with Chriſt; if any thing
in the World cuts in pieces the very Sinews of
Infants Baptiſm 'tis this; for there is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
made between both Parties before the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization
of Marriage; and how can a
Babe of two or ten days old do that? 'tis a
strange Marriage if it be not done, though more
strange indeed without the other. But may be
some will ſay 'tis a Marriage by Proxy or Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as Princes ſometimes are married.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:98169:48"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sometimes there has been ſome ſuch
like Action done I muſt confeſs: But does not
the Prince actually conſent ſo to be married?
But all this while, who has required any thing of
this at our Hands? Are not Sureties in Baptiſm
a meer human Invention? and have not our
Brethren caſt it away as ſuch?</p>
            <p>The third end of Baptiſm, as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>
obſerves, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> 'Tis a Sign to Believers of
the Covenant on God's part <hi>of the waſhing away
of our Sins in the Blood of Chriſt; we ſee,</hi> ſaith lie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>what is done in Baptiſm, the Covenant of Grace is
ſolemnized between God and the Party baptized; and
in this Covenant ſomething belongs to God, and
ſomething to the Party baptized.</hi> Are Infants ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
thus to covenant with God? though we
doubt not but it is ſo in ſome good ſenſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Almighty and a Believer, who is the
only Subject, <hi>i. e.</hi> there is indeed a mutual Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
on both Parties in that Solemnity, but
an Infant can do nothing herein.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Baptiſm, ſaith <hi>Bullinger,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bullinger <hi>upon</hi> Acts 2. 38.</note> is an Agreement or
Covenant of Grace which Chriſt enters into
with us when we are baptized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Baptiſm is called the Baptiſm of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for the Remiſſion of Sins; one end of
this Ordinance therefore is this, <hi>viz.</hi> To teſtify
the Truth of our Repentance, and to engage us
thereby to bring forth Fruits meet for amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <q>As their Sins are not forgiven them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Baxter</hi> on Confirm. <hi>p.</hi> 30, 31.</note> ſaith
Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> till they are converted; ſo they
muſt not be baptized for the Forgiveneſs of
Sins, till they profeſs themſelves converted,
seeing to the Church <hi>non eſſe &amp; non apparere</hi> is
all one. Repentance towards God, and Faith
towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is the ſum of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98169:48"/>
that preaching that makes Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 20,
21. Therefore both theſe muſt by Profeſſion
seem to be received, before any at Age are
Baptized.</q> And that no other, ſay I, beſides
them at Age ought to be baptized, by this very
Argument is very clear and evident.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bullinger,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bullinger <hi>on</hi> Act. 2. 38.</note> as he is quoted by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I find
speaketh thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>To be baptized in the Name
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſaith he, is by a Sign
of Baptiſm, to teſtify that we do believe in
Chriſt for the Remiſſion of Sins: Firſt, mark,
it is not only an Ingagement to believe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
but the Profeſſion, ſaith he, of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Faith. Secondly, And that not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Faith, but that which hath Remiſſion of
Sin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Farewel to Infant Baptiſm; a preſent Faith is
required of ſuch that are to be baptized, nay,
and more, a preſent profeſſion of it too. Infants
have neither Faith, nor can they profeſs it,
<hi>Ergo</hi> they are not to be baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Another End of Baptiſm is, (as one
well obſerves) to evidence preſent Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
whereof, ſaith he,<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 5. Baxter <hi>in his Diſput. with Mr.</hi> Blake, p. 117. <hi>as quoted by Mr.</hi> Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note> it is a lively Sign or
Symbol—Hence 'tis called <hi>the Waſhing of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;</hi>
what ſignifies the Sign, where the Thing
signified is wanting? Baptiſm is frequently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Lave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Regeneration,</hi> it being a Sign or
Figure of it to the Perſon Baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Chriſt hath inſtituted no Baptiſm, ſaith
Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> but what is to be a Sign of preſent
Regeneration; but to Men that profeſs not a
Juſtifying Faith, it cannot be adminiſtred as a
Sign of Regeneration.</q> Therefore he hath
inſtituted no Baptiſm to be adminiſtred to ſuch.
Does not this Argument make void the Baptiſm
of Infants, as well as Adult Unbelievers, by the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98169:49"/>
Ancients? Let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> take it again, but with
a very little alteration. <hi>Chriſt hath inſtituted no Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
but what is to be a Sign of preſent Regeneration;
but to little Babes that profeſs not a juſtifying Faith, it
cannot be adminiſtred as a Sign of preſent Regeneration,
therefore he hath inſtituted no Baptiſm to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
to Infants.</hi> The ſtreſs of the Argument lies
in the Inſtitution of Chriſt, in that no Baptiſm
is inſtituted and commanded by Chriſt, but what
is a Sign of preſent Regeneration, not Future;
therefore Infant-Baptiſm can be no Baptiſm of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Baptiſm is called, <hi>An Anſwer of a good
Conſcience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> 
               <hi>by the Reſurrection of Chriſt</hi> from the
Dead; or <hi>the Covenant of a good Conſcience by the
Reſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> (as ſaith Sir <hi>Norton Knatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bul,</hi>
in his Learned Notes printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> 1677.)
<hi>in the belief of which Reſurrection we are ſaved,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>as they were ſaved by the Ark.</hi> But now In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
cannot Covenant thus, nor Witneſs thus in
Baptiſm by a Belief of the Reſurrection, (which
saith the ſaid famous Learned Man) Baptiſm is
an emphatical Figure, or a particular Signal of,
to the Perſon baptized.</p>
            <p>See what our Late Annotators ſpeak upon the
place;<note place="margin">Pool'<hi>s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notat. on</hi> Tit. 3. 5.</note> 
               <q>In Baptiſm, ſay they, there is a ſolemn
Covenant, or mutual Agreement between God
and the Party baptized, wherein God offers,
applies, and ſeals his Grace, ſtipulating or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
the Parties acceptance of that Grace,
and devoting himſelf to his Service; and
when he, out of a good Conſcience doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
and promiſe this, which is to come up to
the terms of the Covenant, that my be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called <hi>the Anſwer of a good Conſcience</hi>—it
ſeems, ſay they, to be an alluſion to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Baptizing, where the Miniſter aſk'd
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98169:49"/>
the Party to be Baptized concerning his Faith
in Chriſt; and he accordingly anſwered him,
Doſt thou believe?</q> I believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Acts 8. 37.
Now, are Children capable to do any of this?
Can they covenant with God? Can they anſwer
a good Conſcience, by believing the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Chriſt? or can Baptiſm appear
to be a Symbol of it to them? No, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
can <hi>Rantiſm</hi> be ſo to any other, I mean
to the Adult.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Baptiſm hath another End and Use
aſſigned to it, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Party baptized may
have an orderly entrance into the Viſible Church,
and ſo have a right to partake of all other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
and Priviledges thereof, as <hi>breaking of
Bread,</hi> &amp;c. This hereafter I ſhall make fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
nor is it any other thing than is generally
owned by Chriſtians, and eminent Men; but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
cannot be admitted to thoſe Priviledges,
<hi>viz.</hi> to the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and therefore ought not to be baptized; for
he that has right to one, cannot be denied
the other, by any Ground or Authority from
God's Word.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IX. Containing ſeveral other Arguments, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
why not Infants, but Believers
only, are the true Subjects of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</head>
            <p>IF there is no word of Inſtitution,<note place="margin">1. Argument.</note> or any
thing in the Commiſſion of Chriſt for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
Infants, but of Believers only, then not
Infants but Believers only ought to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
            <p>But there is no word of Inſtitution, or any
thing in the Commiſſion of Chriſt, for baptizing
Infants, but of Believers only; <hi>Ergo,</hi> not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
but Believers only are the Subjects of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
            <p>The Major Propoſition is undeniable: for if
Infants may be baptized <hi>in the Name,</hi> &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Authority from Chriſt, or word of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
or the leaſt intimation of it in the
great Commiſſion, what Innovation can we
keep out of the Church? This is enough to cauſe
any Proteſtant to renounce his Religion, and
cleave to the Romiſh Communion, who aſſerts
the Church's Power is ſuch, that without a
word of Inſtitution, ſhe may do the Lord
knows what.—Nor do they, as far as I can
find, aſſert Infant-Baptiſm from the Authority
of the Scripture; but from the Power Chriſt
has left in the Church, in which they ſeem more
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98169:50"/>
honeſt than ſome Proteſtants, that pretend to
maintain this Rite, by plain Scripture-proof,
without the leaſt ſhadow or intimation of any
such thing, to the palpable Reproach of the
Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>As to the Minor, 'tis evident, and owned by
the Learned, that thoſe who are enjoined to be
baptized, in the Commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. are firſt
to be taught, or made Diſciples: But Infants
cannot be made Diſciples, being uncapable of
teaching; therefore there is nothing in that
Commiſſion of Infant-Baptiſm: If they have
any other word of Inſtitution or Commiſſion,
let them produce it, we profeſs we know of
none.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Chriſt commanded his Diſciples to
<hi>baptize all Nations;</hi> Children are part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
therefore may be baptized: Thus you ſee
we have Authority to baptize Children from
the great Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let me have the ſame liberty to argue,
and ſee what will follow, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt commanded
his Diſciples to baptize all Nations; but <hi>Turks,
Pagans,</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> with their Children, are
part of the Nations, <hi>Ergo, Turks, Pagans,</hi> and
<hi>Infidels,</hi> and their Children, may be baptized al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.
Sir, I will appeal to you, is not this Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
as good and as juſtifiable as yours? Come
put it to your Conſciences; Can you ſuppoſe any
should be baptized by virtue of the words of
Chriſt in the Commiſſion, but Diſciples only?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Well, what though that be ſo? yet we
affirm, that Infants are Diſciples, and therefore
may be baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What if we ſhall grant you that Infants
are Diſciples, (which we can never do, it being
utterly falſe) yet they are not ſuch Diſciples
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98169:51"/>
that Chriſt in the Commiſſion requires to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
becauſe they were to be made Diſciples,
by being taught; and that Infants cannot be ſaid
to be, we are ſure.</p>
            <p>The Lord Jeſus hath plainly excluded Infants
in his Commiſſion from this Adminiſtration, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to ordinary Rule; for in that he commands
the them to <hi>Baptize Diſciples,</hi> upon preaching firſt to
them, it follows, that none but ſuch who are ſo
taught, and ſo by teaching made Diſciples, are
by virtue of the Commiſſion, to be baptized;
Infants, after an ordinary rate are uncapble of
underſtanding the Goſpel, when preach'd, and
therefore are uncapable of being made Diſciples
thereby, and there is no other way, according to
ordinary Rule, of being made Diſciples but by that
means: And this the Apoſtles could eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
as knowing that under the term Diſciple,
in common ſpeech, and in the whole New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
thoſe only are meant, who being
taught, profeſſed the Doctrine preached by ſuch
a one as <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples, Chriſt's Diſciples, and
the Diſciples of the Phariſees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Apoſtles adminiſtred Baptiſm. And in
that Chriſt appoints, theſe to be Baptized, we
say, he excludes all others; for the Inſtitution,
Commiſſion, and Commandment of Jeſus Chriſt,
is moſt certainly the only Rule, according to
which we are to adminiſter the Sacrament of
Baptiſm, and all other Holy Things; and they
that do otherwiſe, open a Door to all Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and follow their own Inventions, and are
guilty of Will-worſhip. If you ſhould ſay, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants

not made up of Perſons by meer Humane
Birth, but Spiritual Regeneration. And to ſay
that Infants are born Diſciples by the relation
to the Covenant, and ſo have the Seal ſet on
them, without any precedent Teaching, is but an
unapproved Dictate; as if a Title to Baptiſm
were in its Nature a Seal of the Covenant, which
the Scripture no where affirms; nor is there
any Rule for baptizing of Perſons becauſe of
Relation to the Covenant, ſith Baptiſm wholly
depends upon a poſitive Inſtitution.</p>

called Diſciples, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. Becauſe the Yoak
laid upon the Necks of the Diſciples, was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion;

<hi>ergo,</hi> Infants are Diſciples.</p>

colour of Ground or Reaſon of giving the Name
of Diſciples from that Text to Infants: for tho
true, they are called Diſciples, upon whoſe Necks
the falſe Brethren would have put that Yoak of
Circumciſion; yet what's this, ſith Adult Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Gentiles alſo were required by the
Jews to be circumciſed, as <hi>Timothy, Act.</hi> 16. 3.
And tho it be granted that they would have had
Infants, as well as the converted Gentiles, to
be circumciſed, yet the putting the Yoak of
Circumciſion, is not actual Circumciſion in the
Fleſh; for that the Jews, as well as their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
were able to bear for many Ages. But
the Yoak of Circumciſion is the neceſſity of
it upon Mens Conſciences, and therewith to
oblige them to keep the whole Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
or they could not be ſaved; and this was not
that which they would have put upon Children,
but upon the Diſciples, <hi>i. e.</hi> the faithful Brethren

            <p>The Minor is eaſily proved: Can any thing

than this? as if he ſhould neglect to ſpeak out

about it, that ſorry Man is forc'd to try his
Wit to ſupply what is defective and wanting in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98169:55"/>
this Matter in Chriſt's Word; for he is ſtrangely
left of God and benighted, who will not confeſs
Infant Baptiſm to need much of humane Craft
and Cunning to make it out from Chriſt's New
Teſtament; and when he has done all, he leaves
it as doubtful as he found it in the Judgment of
indifferent Perſons. Did <hi>Moſes</hi> deal thus with
the Children of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> No, no. How careful
was he to deliver every Law, Statute, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
exactly, particularly the Law of the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over!
Do but read how careful and circumſpect
he was in that, in all reſpects and matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to it. Nay, and the Wiſdom of God was
such, to leave nothing then in the dark, but gave
order that all Things might be made plain, <hi>that
he that run might read it,</hi> and he that did read,
might know the Duty, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
(tho in many things they might need in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
how in a right Spirit to be found in it,
and what it ſignified.) But I dare affirm, no Man
who reads the New Teſtament, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>Matthew</hi> to the end of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> a
thouſand times over, ſhall ever from that Holy
Word, or any place or part of it, find it to be
his Duty to baptize his Child; the Word of God
is powerful in convincing Men of their Duties, as
well as of their Sins; but in this it fails, it has no
Power to convince Mens Conſciences. The Faith
of Perſons muſt ſtand in the Wit and Subtilty of
Men, in reſpect of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> and not in the
Power of God, and efficacy of his bleſſed Word.
Let ſome ſhew us the Perſon, who only by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the New Teſtament was convinced of Infant-Baptiſm;
though, 'tis true, divers by reading of
the Writings of Learned Men, and their ſubtil
and ſophiſtical Arguments, (for ſo I muſt call
them) have been perſwaded to believe it to be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98169:56"/>
of God.—Yet, after all, ſome of them have
plainly ſignified the great Ground and Argument
they build upon, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe ſuch and
such Learned, Godly, and Wiſe Men, aſſert it to
be a Truth of Chriſt. So that it appears very
clear, they build their Faith herein, not upon
the Authority of God's Word, but upon the
Credit and Authority of Men. But certainly it
muſt needs, as I ſaid, reflect upon the Honour
and Faithfulneſs of Chriſt, to conclude Infant-Baptiſm
to be of God: for can any think the
Lord Jeſus would leave ſo great an Ordinance,
or Sacrament, of the New Teſtament, ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
and dark in his Sacred Word, had it been
his Mind that Believers ſhould baptize their
Children, ſince the Apoſtle magnifies Chriſt's
Faithfulneſs, who is the Son, above that of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> who was but the Servant? <hi>And</hi> Moſes
<hi>verily was faithful in all his Houſe as a Servant,
for a Teſtimony of thoſe things which were to be
ſpoken after,</hi> Hebr. 3. 5. <hi>But Chriſt as a Son
over his own Houſe,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 6. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>was counted worthy of more glory than</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
ver. 3.</p>
            <p>Beſides, do but conſider what Darkneſs and
Confuſion the Aſſerters of Infant-Baptiſm ſeem
to be in, about the Proof and Right they ſay
Children have to it.</p>
            <p>1. Some of them ſay, it depends wholly upon
the Authority of the Church.</p>
            <p>2. Others dare not baptize them, but as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
and Diſciples, and therefore affirm
they have Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Others can't believe this; and therefore
though they likewiſe baptize them as Believers,

            <head>CHAP. X. Wherein the great Arguments, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Scripture-Proofs for Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
concerning the Covenant Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
and Infants Church-memberſhip,
are Examined, and Anſwered.</head>
            <p>ONE main and great Argument the Pedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts
bring for that practice is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Children of Believers are in Covenant,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Argument from the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </note> as well as
their Parents. The Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi>
was the Covenant of Grace, or Goſpel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
to which the Seal of Circumciſion was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed;
and as Circumciſion belonged to the
Children of the Faithful under the Law, ſo Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
belongs to the Children of the Faithful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Goſpel, or elſe the Priviledges under the
Goſpel would be leſs than thoſe were under the
Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There hath been enough ſaid, over
and over, by Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others, to detect and utterly vanquiſh the
weakneſs of this Argument.</p>
            <p>As, firſt, it hath been proved, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed,
doth not intend his Carnal Seed according to the
Fleſh; but his Spiritual Seed, or ſuch who had
the Faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And one would think the
Apoſtle might be believed in his expounding that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98169:57"/>
Text, <hi>viz. To</hi> Abraham <hi>and to his Seed were the
Promiſes made,</hi> Gal. 3. 16. <hi>He ſaith not, And to Seeds,
as of many, but as of one, And to they Seed, which is
Chriſt.</hi> Compare this with <hi>v. 29. If ye be Chriſt</hi>'s,
<hi>then are ye</hi> Abraham's <hi>Seed, and Heirs. according to
the Promiſe</hi> And again, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8. he ſaith,
<hi>Neither becauſe they are the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>are they
all Children; but in</hi> Isaac <hi>ſhall thy Seed be called.
That is, they which are the Children of the Fleſh,
theſe are not the Children of God: but the Children of
the Promiſe are counted for the Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Could the Apoſtle in plainer words have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
the Error of theſe Men, if he had met
with them in his day? 'Tis true, he did meet
with ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural
Seed, who were ſo blind as thus to argue from
the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
they were the true Seed and Children of
God, becauſe they were the Off-spring of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
according to the Fleſh. But as <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt
firſt endeavoured to undeceive them, when
he ſaw the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> coming to his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm—by
saying,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 7, 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>Think not to ſay with in your
ſelves, ye have</hi> Abraham <hi>to your Father,</hi> &amp;c. So in
the next place, our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf, in
<hi>John.</hi> 8. likewiſe ſhewed them their great Error
and Miſtake herein, and that they might be the
Children of the Devil, notwithſtanding they
were the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the
Fleſh, and thought themſelves ſafe as being in
that Covenant made with him.</p>
            <p>The Covenant of Grace there made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and his Seed, extends to none but the Holy and
Elect Seed, to none but the Spiritual Seed, to ſuch
who are Chriſt's, or true Believers in Chriſt only.
Now if the Covenant of Grace comprehends
none of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s carnal or fleſhly Seed, but the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98169:58"/>
ſpiritual Seed only, to what purpoſe is there ſo
many Sheers of Paper printed by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Sidenham,</hi> &amp;c. to prove the carnal Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
to have right to the Seal of the Covenant?
Their Buſineſs is to prove all Believers Children
to be in the Covenant in the firſt place, or all
they ſay is nothing.</p>
            <p>But, Secondly, if they could prove all the
Children of Believers to be in that Covenant
made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet it doth not from thence
follow neither, that therefore their Children may
be baptized, unleſs they can ſhew the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
hath injoined them ſo to be, becauſe Baptiſm
wholly depends upon the Authority of Chriſt's
Inſtitution, or poſitive Preſcription. 'Tis not
enough for any to ſay, if Children are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
they may be baptized. Who tells them
so? Hath Chriſt any where required it? doth he
say they ought, or that it belongs to them? Had
it been <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Duty to circumciſe his Children,
becauſe they were in Covenant with him, before
God gave him a poſitive Law ſo to do; certainly,
had he done it without any Command of God,
and have called it God's Ordinance, he had ceas'd
being called any more <hi>Faithful Abraham.</hi> Come,
Sirs, your Conſequences and Concluſions you
have ſo long made a noiſe of, will make no
Goſpel-Precept, nor hold equal weight with the
Ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>For, thirdly, pray conſider, Were there not
divers in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> in that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
or Goſpel-Covenant God made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
in that very day and time that the Law of
Circumciſion was given forth? and yet they were
not, from that Ground, to be circumciſed, nor
were they at all circumciſed, becauſe God did not
command them ſo to be? Was not <hi>Lot</hi> a Godly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98169:58"/>
Man, and in the ſame Covenant of Grace? to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> and others I might men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Theſe were in Covenant, and yet without
the Seal, as you call it; we do not read they
were circumciſed. And do you not think that
many of the Females of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s off-ſpring
were in that Covenant of Grace? yet they had
no right to Circumciſion, the Seal (as you called
it) of the Covenant, becauſe none but Males
were required or commanded to be circumciſed.
Suppoſe <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould have gone without a
Command or Word from God, and have Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
his Females, and have reaſoned after the
rate you do, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Female children are in Covenant; and
ſince the Covenant belongs to them, the Seal of
the Covenant belongs to them, which is, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
therefore I will circumciſe them
alſo; would God have allowed him to do any
ſuch Act, think you? You will reply, I am ſure
that God would never have born with <hi>Abraham</hi>
in doing any ſuch thing, becauſe he muſt have
done it without a Command.</p>
            <p>And, pray, how can you think he will bear
with you in Baptizing Children of Believers, ſith
you have no more Command from God ſo to do,
than <hi>Abraham</hi> had to Circumciſe his Female
Children?</p>
            <p>You reply, They are in Covenant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to them belongs the Seal of the Covenant;
even ſo ſay we, his Females might be in the ſame
Covenant, and yet you would have condemned
ſuch an Act in him, though grounded upon the
very ſame foot of an Account, which you ſtand
upon your own Juſtification in, and acknowledg
no Fault, but contrarywiſe blame, nay, reproach
us for holding an Error, becauſe we cannot do
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98169:59"/>
and practice as you do in this caſe, without any
Authority from God's Word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> To prove further, that the Right of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
wholly depended upon the abſolute Will,
Pleaſure, and Soveraignty of God, as Baptiſm
now doth; and that his Will, and not ours, nor
any Conſequence that may be drawn from being
in the Covenant, can give a Perſon a right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
without his Command or allowance; 'tis to
be conſidered, that there were thoſe commanded
to be Circumciſed, who were not (as there is
probable ground to believe) in that holy and
bleſſed Covenant of Grace, God ſaid his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
should not be eſtabliſhed with <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> but
with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> yet he was Circumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 20,
21, 25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29, 30. The ſame might be ſaid
of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and thouſands more of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Seed: It was, it appears from hence, God's
Soveraign Will and Pleaſure that gave right to
Circumciſion, and not being in the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But was not Circumciſion a Seal of the
Covenant of Grace under that Diſpenſation, as
Baptiſm is now a Seal of the ſame Covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Diſpenſation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, for Circumciſion was only a Seal
to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, or a Confirmation of that
Faith he had long before he was Circumciſed;
but ſo it could not be ſaid to be to any Infant
that had no Faith. It was indeed a Sign put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Fleſh of Infants; but a Sign, and Seal too
only to <hi>Abraham,</hi> witneſſing to him that he had
a Juſtifying Faith; but to the Truth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
there was 'tis evident, a two-fold Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> 1. That he ſhould be
the Father of many Nations, and that the Land in
which he was a Stranger ſhould be given to his
Seed; theſe Promiſes ſeem to relate to his Carnal
Seed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:98169:59"/>
2. That he ſhould be the Father of the Faithful,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. Heir of the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. and
that in him, and in his Seed all the Families of
the Earth ſhould be bleſſed, that is, Jeſus Chriſt,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. Now none could receive Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
as ſuch a Seal to them, but <hi>Abraham,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
none before circumciſed had ſuch a Faith,
which intitled them to ſuch ſingular Promiſes:
The Apoſtle in the fourth of the <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ans</hi> ſhews,
that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by Works, nor
by Circumciſion, but by Faith, which he had
long before he was circumciſed; and ſo but a
Seal or Confirmation of that Faith he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and to aſſure him of the Truth of the
Promiſes made to him and to his Carnal and
Spiritual Seed.</p>
            <p>You ought not therefore to call Circumciſion
a Seal to any but to <hi>Abraham,</hi> neither ought you
to call it a Seal of any other thing to him than
what the Scripture calls it a Seal of, <hi>viz. And
he received Circumciſion a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of
the Faith which he had being yet uncircumciſed,</hi>
Rom. 4. 11.</p>
            <p>And that you may ſee we are not alone in
this matter,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact. <hi>Pag.</hi> 117.</note> ſee what <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Theophilact,</hi>
as I find them quoted by Mr. <hi>Danvers;</hi> 
               <q>It was
called a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith,
becauſe it was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> as a Seal and
Teſtimony of that Righteouſneſs which he had
acquired by Faith. Now this ſeems to be the
Priviledg of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s alone, and not to be
tranferred to others; as if Circumciſion in
whom ever it was were a Teſtimony of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Righteouſneſs; for it was the Priviledg of
<hi>Abraham</hi> that he ſhould be the Father of all
the Faithful, as well uncircumciſed as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
being already the Father, having Faith
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98169:60"/>
in Uncircumciſion, he received firſt the ſign of
Circumciſion, that he might be the Father
of the Circumciſed. Now becauſe he had
this Priviledg, in reſpect of the Righteouſneſs
which he had acquired by Faith, therefore
the ſign of Circumciſion was to him a Seal
of the Righteouſneſs of Faith; but to the
reſt of the Jews it was a ſign that they were
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, but not a Seal of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of Faith, as all the Jews alſo were
not the Fathers of many Nations.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, it is evident a Seal is a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that which a Perſon hath made over
to him, and it doth inſure him of it. Now to
call Circumciſion a Seal of the Covenant of
Grace, 'tis all one as to ſay all that were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,
were aſſured of all the Bleſſings of
that Covenant, then muſt all that were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
be pardon'd and ſaved; and ſo alſo would
it follow in the caſe of Baptiſm, were that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be a Seal to all thoſe that are
baptized of the new Covenant. But in a word,
we know nothing called a Seal of the New
Covenant, but the holy Spirit, which the Saints
were ſaid to be ſealed with after they believed,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. &amp; 4. 30. unto the day of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
God by ſetting his Seal upon us aſſures
us that we are his, and that we ſhall have Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life.</p>
            <p>Baptiſm is called a Figure, but no where a
Seal and a Sign or Figure proper only to ſuch
who have Underſtanding to diſcern the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
things and Myſteries that are repreſented
thereby, and wrought in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Say what what you will, the Promiſe and
Covenant of Grace was to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural
Off-ſpring.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:98169:60"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why do you not believe the Apoſtle
who tells you the quite contrary, and that he
<hi>ſaid not of Seeds as of many, but to thy Seed, which
is Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it you will have it as you ſay, ſee what
abſurd Conſequences will follow and ariſe from
your Notion: And firſt take what <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Calvin <hi>on</hi> Gen. 17. 7.</note>
'Tis manifeſt, ſaith he, that the Promiſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of Spiritual Bleſſings pertaineth not to
the Carnal Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
as the Apoſtle himſelf ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 8, 9.
for if you underſtand the Carnal Seed, ſaith he,
then that Promiſe will belong to none of the
Gentiles, but to thoſe alone who are begotten
of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> according to the Fleſh;<note place="margin">Eſtius. Anno <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7.</note>
by this it appears you go about to ſhut out your
selves and Children too from having any part
in that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If God made the Covenant of Grace
with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Carnal or Fleſhly Off-ſpring,
and ſo with all Believers and their Children,
then all their Off-ſpring muſt have ſaving Grace
beſtowed upon them and a new Heart, becauſe
theſe things are ſome of the chief Bleſſings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the new Covenant.</p>
            <p>Now do you ſee that all the Children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
have the Grace of God beſtowed upon
them, ſo that they are new Creatures? certainly
no, for as <hi>Abraham</hi> had his <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> his
<hi>Eſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> his <hi>Abſolom,</hi> ſo have moſt or
many Believers wicked and ungodly Children,
and ſo they live and die to the great Grief of
their Souls: You can't think that God fails in his
Promiſe, and that the Covenant of Grace is not
so firm and ſure as the Scripture declares it to
be, one of them will follow, or you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
your ſelves miſtaken in your Notion:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98169:61"/>
But certainly they cannot miſs of Grace if
Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> is right;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Agr.</hi> Blake, <hi>p.</hi> 6.</note> for, ſaith he, <hi>Chriſtianity is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary;
that as the Children of a Noble-Man are
Noble, the Child of a Free-Man free, of a Turk a
Turk, and of a Jew; a Jew ſo</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">If he had ſaid, Thoſe who are born of the Spirit are ſpiritual, he had ſpoke Truth.</note> 
               <hi>the Child of a

are ſo called, but withal muſt tell him, the
Children of Chriſtian People are by Nature
the Children of Wrath as well as others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This would render Grace to be a
Birth-Priviledg, as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> obſerves, and
Regeneration tied to Generation, contrary to
the Scripture and all good Doctrine; as if a
Believer doth not only beget a Child in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Generation, but a Saint alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Then the Apoſtle ſpake not true in
saving the <hi>Children of the Fleſh, theſe are not the
Children of God,</hi> i. e. of the Promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And it alſo would follow, that all the
whole Off-ſpring of Believers ſhall be ſaved,
without you will aſſert the Doctrine of <hi>James
Arminius,</hi> that there is a falling away from
Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> And would it not follow alſo, that
all the Children of Believers know God, and
need not be taught,<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 34.</note> 
               <hi>ſaying, Know the Lord, for</hi>
(you know who ſaith) <hi>they ſhall all know me,
from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them;</hi> that
is, all thoſe who are in the New Covenant, which
you ſay all Believers Children are, even in
the ſame <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> And then it follows alſo that the
Covenant of Grace and Spiritual Bleſſings made
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> is tied up to Believers and their Seed
only; and if ſo, what will become of all poor
Unbelievers and their periſhing Off-ſpring?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:98169:61"/>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But does not Baptiſm come in the
room of Circumciſion, the one being a Figure
of the other?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no ground ſo to believe, ſince
the Scripture gives not the leaſt hint of any
ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>1. For firſt, if it had, then when Baptiſm
came in and was in force, Circumciſion muſt have
ceaſed immediately: but after Baptiſm was
commanded and adminiſtred, we find Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
in being, and was not diſannull'd till the
Death and Reſurrection of our Saviour. Now
it would have vanquiſh'd, as Shadows do, as
ſoon as Baptiſm the Antitype came in force, had
it been a Type or Figure of Baptiſm, or come
in the room of it.</p>
            <p>2. If Baptiſm had come in the room of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
then the Church of God under the
Goſpel would have been juſt like the National
Church of the Jews, <hi>viz.</hi> made up of the Fleſhly
Seed;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> but the Apoſtle ſhews thè contrary, it
conſiſts of lively Stones, that is, a ſpiritual and
not a carnal Seed.</p>
            <p>3. Then Males only and no Females would have
been baptized; becauſe none but Male Children
were to be circumciſed, as God commanded.</p>
            <p>4. Circumciſion was adminiſtred on <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
natural Seed without any Profeſſion of

another thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the Deſtruction of the Body

                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Taylor <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Down, <hi>p.</hi> 228.</note> who ſaith, <q>That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
from Circumciſion is invalid upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Conſiderations: Figures and Types prove
nothing, unleſs a Command go along with
them, or ſome Expreſs to ſignify ſuch to be
their purpoſe; for the Deluge of Waters,
and the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> were a Figure of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
ſaid <hi>Peter;</hi> and if therefore the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of the one ſhould be drawn to
the other, we ſhould make Baptiſm a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy
rather than a Rite. The Paſchal Lamb
was a Type of the Euchariſt, which ſucceeds
the other, as Baptiſm doth to Circumciſion;
but becauſe there was in the Manducation of
the Paſchal Lamb, no Preſcription of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Drink, ſhall we thence conclude that
the Euchariſt is to be adminiſtred but in one
kind? And even in the very inſtance of this
Argument, ſuppoſing a Correſpondency of
the Analogy between Circumciſion and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
yet there is no Correſpondency of Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity;
for although it were granted, that both
of them did conſign the Covenant of Faith,
yet there is nothing in the Circumſtance of
Childrens being circumciſed that ſo concerns
that Myſtery, but that it might very well
be given to Children, and yet Baptiſm only
to Men of Reaſon, becauſe Circumciſion leſt
a Character in the Fleſh, which being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
upon Infants did its work to them
when they came to Age; and ſuch a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
was neceſſary, becauſe there was no
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98169:62"/>
word added to the Sign; but Baptiſm im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints
nothing that remains on the Body,
and if it leaves a Character at all, it is upon
the Soul, to which alſo the Word is added,
which is as much a part of the Sacrament,
as the Sign it ſelf: for both which Reaſons
it is requiſite that the Parties baptized ſhould
be capable of Reaſon, that they may be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
both of the word of the Sacrament,
and the impreſs made upon the Spirit; ſince
therefore the Reaſon of this Parity does
wholly fail, there is nothing left to infer a
neceſſity of complying in this Circumſtance
of Age any more than in the other Annxes
of the Type; then the Infant muſt alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
be baptized upon the eighth day, and
Females muſt not be baptized, becauſe not
circumciſed: but it were more proper if we
would underſtand it right to proſecute the
Analogy, form the Type to the Antitype by
way of Letter, and Spirit, and Signification.
And as Circumciſion figures Baptiſm, ſo alſo
the Adjuncts of the Circumciſion, ſhall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
something ſpiritual in the Adherences
of Baptiſm; and therefore as Infants were
circumciſed, ſo ſpiritual Infants ſhall be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
which is ſpiritual Circumciſion; for
therefore Babes had the Miniſtry of the Type,
to ſignify that we muſt, when we give our
Names to Chriſt, become Children in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
and then the Type is made compleat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Members of the Jewiſh Church is granted, and

and turned the Bond-Woman and her Son, (<hi>i. e.</hi>
the Fleſhly Seed, Servants and Infants) all out of
doors; the natural Branches are broken off, and
God hath now built him a new, a glorious, and
more ſpiritual Houſe, into which he admitteth
none as his Houſhold-Servants to dwell in his
Spiritual Family, but Believers only, or ſuch as
profeſs ſo to be:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

that the old Houſe, the Jewiſh Church-state,
with all the Appurtenances, Rites, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of it, is pulled down, and a new one built,
into which Infants are not to be admitted, is
very evident from what the Apoſtle ſpeaks,
Heb. 7. 12. <hi>For the Prieſthood being changed; there
is made of neceſſary a Change alſo of the whole Law,</hi>
which muſt needs include Circumciſion with all
the Appurtenances and Priviledges belonging
to it. And therefore as Infants Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip
came in with the Law of Circumciſion,
so it went out and was diſanull'd with it;
they were, 'tis true, of the Houſhold of old,
but it was by a poſitive Law: Shew us the like
now and you do your buſineſs, or elſe you
say nothing; <hi>For evident it is that what Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
ſoever are given to any Perſons by an Act
of Parliament, which ſaid Law was to continue in
force for ſo long a time and no longer, when that time
is expired and another Parliament makes a new
Law, wherein many things are contained that were

thoſe Priviledges by virtue of a Law that is gone,
and now not in force. Or if a Man ſhould have a
Legacy bequeathed to him by the Will and Teſtament
of his Friend, and yet afterwards his Friend ſees
cauſe to make another Will, which is his laſt Will and
Teſtament, and in the laſt Will leaves him quite out
and gives him no ſuch Legacy, it would be a fooliſh
thing for him to ſue for the Legacy left him in the firſt
Will, which is void in Law by his Friends laſt
Will and Teſtament.</hi> Juſt ſo it is here; there
was an old Law wherein Infants were admitted
to the Priviledges of being Members of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church of the Jews, and ſo alſo it was
in the old or former Will and Teſtament; but
that Law was to continue but till Chriſt came,
and now he has made a new Law wherein
Infant-Church-memberſhip is quite left out, and
the Lord Jeſus has made another Will, his laſt
Will and Teſtament, wherein the old Priviledg
is not be queathed to Infants: Now is it not folly
in you to plead for that old Priviledg that was in
the former Teſtament? you muſt find your Infant-Church-memberſhip
in the New Teſtament, as

               </note>, or elſe they and you too ſay

Argument they may be Members of God's
Church, unleſs by any Law or Inſtitution God
has made them ſo to be. The Houſhold of
God is called <hi>the Houſhold of Faith,</hi> or a Family
that conſiſteth of Believers; therefore unleſs

they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by
Faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We anſwer, that the Reaſon why the Jews
and their Children were broken off, was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they had not believing Parents, for <hi>Abraham,
Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were ſtill the Parents of them all,
they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, according to the Fleſh,
when they were broken off as well as before; but
the true reaſon was, becauſe the terms of ſtanding
in the Church were now <hi>altered:</hi> For before the
Goſpel-Diſpenſation came, they ſtood Members
of the old Jewiſh Church, though as much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
for many Generations, as they were
when they were broken off; but now <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
Church-state is at an end, and all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and Immunities ceaſe, the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi>
muſt give way to the Goſpel-Church, the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
being come, and about to build him up a new
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98169:65"/>
and more glorious and ſpiritual Houſe, into
which none are of right to enter but ſuch as
are <hi>profeſt Believers;</hi> for the old Houſe or Jewiſh
Church-state was not intended to abide <hi>for ever,</hi>
but only until the time of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and then
the Law muſt be changed, yea the Covenant
changed, which they not believing, nor cloſing in
with, were broken off, they being willing to
abide in the old Houſe ſtill, and to remain
Church-Members upon the account of a meer
fleſhly and natural Birth, crying out, <hi>Abraham</hi> is
our Father,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and we are his Seed,</hi> and are free,
and never were in Bondage, wherefore they
were broken off, and that whether they would
or not, by reaſon of their Unbelief; that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they would not believe Chriſt was the
true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and that the old Covenant and all
the Priviledges thereof were flying away, the
Subſtance and true Antitype of all thoſe Shadows
being come, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So that thus they were broken off by Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
<hi>and thou and thine,</hi> O Gentile Believer, <hi>ſtand
by Faith,</hi> mark it, <hi>thou ſtandeſt by Faith;</hi> not
by virtue of any Birth-Priviledg whatſoever,
but by Faith, thy ſtanding is by Faith; yet
not thy Seed by thy Faith, but thou thy ſelf
by thine, and they by their own; Faith is that
by which (thou ſtanding and not thy Seed)
haſt right to ſtand in the Church, and not they;
but if thy Seed have Faith, and thou haſt none,
they have right in the Church, and thou ſhalt be
excluded.</p>
            <p>Moſt certain it is, that under the Law the
natural Seed or Progeny of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were all
holy with an External, Ceremonial, or Typical
Holineſs, and conſequently they were then all
admitted to an external Participation of Church-Priviledges.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98169:65"/>
But remarkable to this purpoſe is
that Paſſage of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16.
<hi>Wherefore henceforth know we no Man after the
Fleſh;</hi> it ſeems then, that heretofore there had
been a knowledg taken of Perſons after the
Fleſh; and 'tis as plain there was, that becuaſe the
Jews were of the natural or fleſhly Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
they were therefore all of them admitted
to the Priviledg of an external Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip,
while others were exempted. But we
see the Apoſtle reſolves <hi>henceforth</hi> to diſclaim any
such <hi>cognizance</hi> of them, or any others upon the
account of a meer fleſhly Deſcent: And to this
very purpoſe immediately ſubjoyns in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Verſe, <hi>Therefore if any Man be in Chriſt, he
is a new Creature: old things are paſt away, all
things are become new;</hi> the old Church, and old
Church-memberſhip, Rites, Ordinances and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
and a new Church-ſtate, new Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
a new Seed, and new way of Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
unto the Participation of the Priviledge
of Church-memberſhip now under this new
and more glorious Diſpenſation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Goſpel:
Nothing but a new Creature will ſerve the
turn; for God expects that they <hi>that worſhip
him, do now worſhip him in Spirit and is Truth;</hi> the
Priviledg of being admitted into God's Houſe,
and to ſtand before his Preſence in the actual
Celebration of Goſpel-Ordinances, being now
entailed only upon the Spiritual Seed, even ſuch
<hi>who as lively Stones are built up a ſpiritual Houſe, a
holy Prieſthood to offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 3, 4, 5. or
ſuch at leaſt as make a viſible Profeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>And therefore, when this new and more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Diſpenſation was about to be actually
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98169:66"/>
introduced and eſtabliſhed, <hi>John</hi> who was the
Harbinger of it gives ſufficient notice thereof;
and to this purpoſe deals plainly with the Jews,
<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi> that came to be
baptized of him, and tells them upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<hi>Mat. 3. 9, 10. Think not to ſay within your
ſelves, We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father: For I
ſay unto you, that God is able of theſe Stones to raiſe
up Children to</hi> Abraham. <hi>And now alſo is the Ax
laid unto the root of the Trees: Therefore every Tree
that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down,
and caſt into the Fire.</hi> It cannot be denied but
that they had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father as much
now as before, only the terms of their ſtanding
in that Church was now changed; ſo that every
Tree now of whatſoever natural Stock or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Production, that bringeth not forth good
Fruit, muſt be hewn down; and the reaſon is
rendred for that, Now the Ax is laid to the root
of the Trees, mark it, <hi>now</hi> 'tis ſo; it was not
so before, the Ax was never till <hi>now</hi> laid thus
unto the root of the Trees: which muſt needs
be underſtood in reference to that Birth and
Fleſhly Priviledg ſpoken of before, which they
had ſo long boaſted of, as the whole Context
shews. But now God is reſolved to make other
manner of work of it under the Goſpel-Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
than he did before. Now the root of
the Trees are ſtruck at, a Bar put, natural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
or Extraction from a Religious Root, (<hi>i.e.</hi>
Godly Parents) will not now ſerve turn, as in
time paſt it did, to give any true Right or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to Church-Priviledges. Moreover, if God
now will not ſuffer any of the natural Branches
to abide on their own natural Stock, <hi>viz. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
be ſure he will not admit any Gentiles,
that are not natural Branches of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98169:66"/>
grafted into the good Olive, without Faith and
Regeneration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But if Children may not be baptized,
this makes the Priviledg of Believers Children
under the Goſpel leſs than was theirs under the
Law; for their Children were admitted Members
of the viſible Church by Circumciſion; and we
cannot but conclude, that our Priviledges for
our ſelves and for our Children, are at leaſt
as large, great and comfortable as theirs, and
therefore our Infants are to be baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this we reply, that we do not
doubt but that our Priviledges, in reſpect of the
Covenant of Grace, and all Spiritual Bleſſings
are as great and comfortable as theirs were;
but the Covenant of Grace, the Bleſſings and
Divine Priviledges thereof, were neither made
to the Jews natural Poſterity, nor to ours; and
although Circumciſion was a Priviledg in ſome
reſpect to the Jews above what the Heathens
had,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 10.</note> yet it is termed by the Apoſtle an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Yoke; <hi>Now therefore why tempt ye God to
put a Yoke upon the Necks of the Diſciples, which
neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear?</hi>
Their Children were not circumciſed as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Believers, and ſo ſealed with a new
Covenant-Seal, as being made new Covenant-Children
thereby; Circumciſion did not confer
Grace, nor make them Heirs of the Kingdom
of Heaven, it was therefore no more than an
external Priviledg to the natural Lineage and
Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a typical and ſhadowy
thing, whereby his Poſterity was to be mark'd,
to diſtinguiſh them from all the Nations of the
Earth, and to keep that Line clear, from whence
Chriſt according to the Fleſh was to come,
and to be a Sign in their Fleſh to put them in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98169:67"/>
mind that God would perform the Promiſe
of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and alſo to
oblige them to keep the Law; for he that
was circumciſed was a Debtor to keep the
whole Law.</p>
            <p>Hence it was the Jewiſh Chriſtians, inſtead
of looking upon Circumciſion to be a Priviledg
upon a ſpiritual account, could not but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
it a great Mercy they were delivered
from it; and hence 'tis the Apoſtle exhorts the
Saints to <hi>ſtand faſt in that Liberty in which Chriſt
had made them free,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>and not be intangled again in
the Yoke of Bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither ought ſuch a thing (as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi>
obſerves) to be any more eſteemed the loſs of
a Priviledg than our not injoying literally a
<hi>Holy Land, City, Temple,</hi> a Succeſſion of High-Prieſts,
and Prieſthood, by Generation or Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Deſcent. (For you know their Children were
<hi>Prieſts ſucceſſively</hi> in their Generations, a <hi>Levite</hi>
begat a Prieſt or Miniſter, as well as they and
other Tribes begat Church-Members.)</p>
            <p>Now though all theſe outward Priviledges
are gone, yet our Priviledges being more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,

laid them under a Bond to do and keep all

            <p>So that it is no Abſurdity to grant that the Jews
might have Priviledges in ſome things more
than we; and yet our Caſe and Condition with our
Children, to ſpeak ſimply, better than theirs,
tho the Covenant of Grace is not enlarged nor
leſſened in reſpect of the ſubſtance of it; the
Promiſes of Grace are ſtill belonging to the Elect,
to thoſe that were given to Chriſt, to Believers,
and to no other, nor never were; but the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
we have above them do abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
the defect of thoſe Priviledges of
theirs, whether real or ſuppoſed: And the
truth is, Priviledges are ſo arbitrary and various,
depending ſo much upon the Soveraignty of
God, that he gives them as he thinks good, and
oft-times takes them away without aſſigning
any ſpecial Reaſon of it; ſo that no Arguments
can be drawn ſafely, as our Brethren do, <hi>viz.</hi>
God gave ſuch a Priviledg to the Jews, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt have ſuch a Priviledg too, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we can prove it is God's Will it ſhould
be ſo. This Argument therefore is of no force,
without an Inſtitution, here we are again, and
here we will ſtand; Circumciſion wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
upon a poſitive Law; 'tis in vain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to attempt to prove, that becauſe the Jews
had a Priviledg to circumciſe their Children,
therefore we muſt have a Priviledg to baptize
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98169:68"/>
our Infants, ſith they had a Command to do what
they did, and we have none; beſides, we have
shewed there is no Scripture that proves the
Baptiſm of Infants is a Priviledg granted by
the Lord in lieu of Circumciſion, it being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no Duty or Priviledg at all.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, before I cloſe with this, take what
Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">Danvers <hi>on Bapt.</hi> p. 180.</note> 
               <q>If it ſhould be taken (saith
he) for granted, that Circumciſion was a
Seal of the New Covenant belonging to all
the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> then would not the
baptizing of the Children of Believers anſwer
it, neither amount to ſo great a Priviledg,
nor be equivalent to it for theſe Reaſons:</q>

            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt,</hi> There were all the Families and Tribes
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (and all proſelyted Strangers) with
their Children, without diſtinction of good or
bad, to be circumciſied: But here only one of
a City, and two of a Tribe; for Believers
are but thin ſown, and the Children of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers
and wicked Men are to receive no
such benefit in the Judgment of many.</p>
               <p>And,<note place="margin">Beſides, they are at a loſs to know what to do if the Father only, or the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only is a Believer.</note> 
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> You would be very ſhort in
another reſpect, as being at an utter uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
when you have a right Subject; for if the
Parent is an Hypocrite, or no elect Perſon,
which is out of your reach to underſtand,
you cannot know whether the <hi>Child</hi> be fit
for <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> for the Seed of a wicked Man
you muſt not meddle with by any <hi>means;</hi>
whereas there was not the leaſt doubt or
scruple in <hi>Iſrael</hi> as to the Subject, for the
Father being one of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,
it was an infallible mark they were
right.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>3dly,</hi> neither can the Child when he
is grown up have any certain knowledg that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98169:69"/>
such a Ceremony had paſt upon him in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
he having no infallible mark thereof;
whereas the circumciſed Infant had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible

            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But what hope can we have of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
if they muſt not be admitted unto Chriſtian Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We anſwer; <hi>Firſt,</hi> if the hope of the
Parent for the Child's Salvation be grounded
upon the Adminiſtration of an external Rite or
Ordinance in Infancy, then neither had the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi>
for above two thouſand Years any hope
of their Children, ſith they had neither Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
Baptiſm, nor any other External Rite,
which we find otherwiſe by <hi>Noah</hi>'s Prophecy,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We aſk, whether God hath left it in
the Power of the Parent to ſave or deſtroy the
Soul of his Child, which your Doctrine doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We demand what hopes are inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and by what Scriptures the ſame are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the Adminiſtration of an Ordinance in
Infancy?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We do ſay there is a ground of
hope in Believers in behalf of their Children,
which is grounded upon plain Scripture without
baptizing them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Doth Baptiſm confer Grace or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
the Child? Though ſome have igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98169:69"/>
Goſpel-grounds of the Salvation of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That the Kingdom of Heaven belongs
to little Children we have no cauſe to doubt:
But that they have a right to Baptiſm therefore,
is deny'd; May not our Brethren infer from the
greater to the leſſer thus as well, <hi>viz. Infants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Kingdom of Heaven, which is the greater;

are fit Subjects of Baptiſm ought not to be

deny'd the Sacrament of Bread and Wine. How
often muſt we tell you that Baptiſm wholly
depends, as to Subject, Time, End, and manner of
Adminiſtration, on the words of Inſtitution? 'tis
a poſitive Law, we muſt go to the Pleaſure, and
Will, and Deſign of the Law-maker: what may
not Men infer after this ſort?</p>
            <p>2. Were theſe little Children be ye ſure the
Children of Believers? If you can't prove this,
what ſignifies all you ſay? and how this can
be made appear I ſee not; for though Chriſt
was then in the Coaſt of <hi>Judea,</hi> yet that they
were Children of Godly Parents is a great
Queſtion.</p>
            <p>3. If it ſhould be granted they were Believers
Children, yet it doth not appear how little
theſe Children were, we have no account of
their Age. And as the Learned obſerve, the
Greek work doth not always ſignify a little
Child or Infant, as appears by 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.

            <p>
               <q>From the Action of Chriſt's bleſſing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
saith he, to infer that they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
proves nothing ſo much, as there is a

thus, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt bleſſed Children and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed

Infants are not to be baptized. But let
this be as weak as its Enemy, yet that Chriſt

that he hath other ways of bringing them
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98169:70"/>
to Heaven than by Baptiſm; he paſſed an
Act of Grace upon them by Benediction and

he hath tied all Men of Years and

own Heads ſhall carry Infants to him that way,
without his directions: the Conceit is poor

Water, an external thing, work upon the

that all that were baptized were regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
then all that were baptized ſhould be

for 'tis the Sacrament of Regeneration, as
the Lord's-Supper is of Nouriſhment. As a

Creature without Faith: Put the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Meat into the Mouth of a dead Man,
you do not nouriſh him, becauſe he wants a
Principle of Life to concoct or digeſt it.
Faith only is the Principle of ſpiritual Life,
and the Principle which draws Nouriſhment
from the Means of God's Appointment. Some
indeed ſay, that Regeneration is conferred in
Baptiſm upon the Elect, and exerts it ſelf
afterwards in Converſion; but how ſo active
a Principle as a Spiritual Life, ſhould lie dead
and aſleep ſo long, even many Years, which
intervene between Baptiſm and Converſion,

Water and Spirit in this place, ſignifies the
same thing; and by Water is meant the Effects
of the Spirit cleanſing and purifying the Soul,
as it appears in its parallel place, Chriſt's
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98169:72"/>
baptizing with the Holy Ghoſt and with
Fire: for although this was literally fulfilled
in the day of <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> yet morally there is
more in it; for it is the ſign of the Effect
of the holy Spirit, and his Productions upon
the Soul: And you may as well conclude, that
Infants muſt alſo paſs through the Fire, as
through the Water. And that we may not
think this a trick to elude the preſſure of
this place, <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith the ſame thing: For
where he ſaith that Baptiſm ſaves us, he adds
by way of Explication (<hi>not the waſhing away
of the Filth of the Fleſh, but the Anſwer of a
good Conſcience towards God</hi>) plainly ſaying
that it is not Water, or the purifying of the
Body, but cleanſing of the Spirit that doth
that which is ſuppoſed to be the Effect of
Baptiſm. But to ſuppoſe it meant of external
Baptiſm, yet this no more infers a neceſſity of
Infant-Baptiſm, than the other words of Chriſt
infer a neceſſity to give them the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<hi>Joh. 6. 53. Except ye eat the Fleſh of
the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no
Life in you;</hi> and yet we do not think theſe
words a ſufficient Argument to communicate
with them: if any Man therefore will do us
Juſtice, either let them give both Sacraments
to Infunts, as ſome Ages of the Church did,
or neither: for the Wit of Man is not able
to ſhew a diſparity in the Sanction, or in the
<hi>Energy</hi> of its Expreſſions. And therefore
they were honeſt that underſtood the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to be parallel, and performed it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly;
and yet becauſe we ſay they were
deceived in one Inſtance, and yet the Obligation
(all the World cannot reaſonably ſay but) is
the ſame they are honeſt and reaſonable that do

you can prove there were no whole Houſholds

appear, and this is the beſt Argument you can

how many hundred Houſholds or Families are

Children; and therefore, in his Judgment, Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis evident that <hi>Peter</hi> preach'd this
Sermon to the Jews, and to many of them who
had a hand in mur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hering the Lord of Life and
Glory: And this he laid home, and preſt upon
their Conſciences very cloſe; and they <hi>being
prick'd in their Hearts, cried out, Men and Brethren,
what ſhall we do?</hi> If it be thus,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 37.</note> we are loſt Men
and undone. No: as if <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould ſay, Do not
diſpair, upon your Repentance there is Mercy
for you. <hi>Then ſaid</hi> Peter <hi>unto them, Repent, and
be baptized every one of you, for the Remiſſion of Sins,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98169:74"/>
and ye ſhall receive the Gift of the Holy Spirit—For
the Promiſe is unto you.</hi> Ay, this is good
News indeed, they might ſay; But what will
become of our Children, our Off-spring? for we
have wiſh'd that his Blood might not only be
upon our ſelves, but alſo upon our Children.
Well, what tho? let not this terrify you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as to drive you into deſpair; for the Promiſe
is not only to you who repent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to
your Children, or Off-spring alſo; your Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
shall not be loſt, for the Promiſe is unto them as
it is to you, <hi>viz.</hi> if they repent; and not only to
them of your Race or Poſterity, but alſo to all
<hi>that are afar off,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 13.</note> meaning the Gentiles, who
were ſaid <hi>to be ſometimes afar off.</hi> But now if they
would know who of their Children, and thoſe
who were afar off, the Promiſe was made unto:
In the cloſe of the Verſe, he reſolves them in
theſe words, <hi>Even to as many as the Lord our God
ſhall call.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Promiſe therefore here evident, is that
of the Spirit, and all the Divine Graces and
Bleſſings of it, which was promiſed, and firſt
tendered unto the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Off-spring,
upon unfeigned Repentance, and turning to God;
or being effectually called and brought over, to
cloſe in with the Tenders of Mercy; and then to
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who in like manner ſhould be
wrought upon, or effectually called: This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
was not made to their Children, as Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Seed, nor to them, or any other, uncalled
by the Lord, but with this expreſs Proviſo, <hi>Even
ſo many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> Which Calling,
or effectual Work of Grace upon their Souls, made
them capable Subjects of Baptiſm: Nor are the
words, <hi>to you and your Children,</hi> mentioned as an
acknowledgment of a Priviledg to them above
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98169:75"/>
others, being <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed according to the
Fleſh, but by reaſon doubtleſs of their Wiſh.
<hi>Mat. 27. 25. His Blood he on us, and on our Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is there the leaſt intimation given of a
right to Baptiſm to them, or their Children, as
the Children of Believers, but as an Exhortation
to them and theirs, to <hi>repent, and be baptized,</hi> as
their Duty, for their Benefit and Soul-advantage,
the Promiſe being not mentioned; as though of
it ſelf it gave a title to Baptiſm, either to them
or their Off-spring, without Repentance. But as
a Motive, why both they and their Children
should actually repent, and be baptized, <hi>i. e.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in ſo doing, they would be in the way of
obtaining Remiſſion of Sin, and receive the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, the two grand Branches of the Promiſe
here mentioned. Which Duty of Repentance
little Children being not capable of performing,
are not therefore according to this direction of
the Apoſtle the <hi>proper Subjects</hi> of ſuch an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
            <p>By Children, here ſaith, a Learned Man, is not
meant their Infants, but the Poſterity of the
<hi>Jews:</hi> And ſo Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> grants it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
confeſſeth this place a very unconcluding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
for Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>And, ſays he, though by Children be here
meant the Poſterity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet not the
natural or carnal Seed neither, but the Spiritual;
as appears by the laſt words in the verſe, viz.
<hi>Even to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that it is very evident, that this Text is
groſly abuſed, by ſuch as infer from hence a
title to <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> for Children of Believers, by
virtue of a Promiſe to them as ſuch; whereas it
is manifeſt from the whole ſcope of the Context,
that it is only an incouragement to the <hi>Jews</hi>

            <p>Object. <hi>From hence 'tis aſſerted,</hi> That the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this we anſwer, That the ſame ſort
of Holineſs which is aſcribed to the Children, is
to be underſtood in reference to the unbelieving
Huſband, or the unbelieving Wife, who are both
said to be ſanctified by their reſpective Yoke-fellows;
which cannot be meant of a federal or
a Covenant-holineſs, but that which is matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial:
For if we muſt underſtand it of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-holineſs,
then it will follow, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
Wife, or unbelieving Huſband may,
upon the ſame ground lay claim to Baptiſm as well
as their Children, which yet your ſelves will not
grant. Beſides, it is evident from the words
themſelves, in which the Term <hi>Huſband</hi> and
<hi>Wife</hi> are twice uſed, which ſhews, that the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is from the conjugal Relation, and cannot be
meant of any other than Legitimation. And the
term <hi>Vnbeliever</hi> is alſo twice uſed, and ſaid to be
Sanctified, which can have no other ſence but
this, that the unbelieving Yoke-fellow is ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or made meet in reſpect of conjugal uſe, to
his or her Yoke-fellow: And ſo though the one
be an Unbeliever, yet they might comfortably

Parents are Believers and in the Covenant

their Marriages are not to be pulled aſunder for
their unlike Opinions of God; if the impious
Perſon do not caſt away the other; and for
comfort he adds as a Reaſon, The unbelieving
Husband is ſanctified by the believing Wife.
Meat is ſanctified; for that which is holy in
uſe, that is, it is granted to Believers from
God; ſo here he ſpeaks of the uſe of Marriage
to be holy, and to be granted of God. Things
prohibited under the Law, as Swines Fleſh,
and a Woman in her Pollution, were called
unclean. The Connexion of this, if the uſe
of Marriage ſhould not pleaſe God, your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
would be Baſtards, and ſo unclean:
But your Children are not Baſtards, therefore
the uſe of the Marriage pleaſeth God: And

Commiſſion, and Practice of the Apoſtolical
Church being that alone that can warrant the
ſame: 'Tis God's Word only, not Mens Reaſon,
conceited Grounds and Inferences, that can juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
a Practice, or make a Goſpel-Ordinance; if
all therefore was granted which you affirm of
the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
and <hi>Faederal-Holineſs,</hi> yet Infant-Baptiſm is
gone, unleſs you can prove God hath from this
ground commanded you to baptize your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or that they were for this Reaſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Baptiſm in the Apoſtles Time (for
all your Arguments from thence prove as
ſtrongly, that your Infants may partake of the
Lord's-Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) But that any thing leſs than
a Profeſſion of Faith and Repentance is or can
be a ſufficient ground for baptizing any Perſon,

               </gap>re po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Precepts, and depend only upon the Will
and Pleaſure of the Law-maker. So much to
this pretended Proof of Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>A ſixth Proof of Infant-Baptiſm is grounded
upon <hi>Mark 16. 16. He that believeth, and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98169:79"/>
ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not, ſhall be
damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now they affirm that Infants are Believers,
and therefore are to be baptized.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Smythies</hi> ſays, <q>Infants are Believers in a
ſenſe, or elſe they could not be ſaved,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Smy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Infants are Believers.</note> nor
have right to the Promiſes of Chriſt in the
Goſpel; and if they are in any ſenſe ſuch Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
as are intitled to Salvation, they are
such Believers as have a right to Baptiſm; if
the Estate belongs to a Child in the Cradle,
the Indentures and Seals of that Estate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to him likewiſe: the Child of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
may as well be called a Believer, as the
Child of a Proſelyte was called a proſelyte: if
God gives Children but the denomination of
Believers, it is ſufficient to entitle them to
Baptiſm. Thus Mr. <hi>Smythies.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But how does it appear that Infants are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
in any ſenſe? is there any Argument or
Scripture brought by this Man to prove them
ſo to be? if he can prove they have Faith and
do believe in Chriſt, he will do more than all
the Men that ever lived on Earth could do, I
mean Children, as ſuch in common and in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
way, to be Believers. True, nothing is too
hard for God to do: he that can make an Aſs
to ſpeak, can as well cauſe a Babe to believe:
But how does it appear God has given them
either the Habit of Faith, or the Act of Faith,
or Faith in any ſenſe to render them to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers?
But 'tis intimated <hi>they are Believers by
their Parents Faith:</hi> why may not their Parents
Baptiſm ſerve as well as their Parents Faith,
and they receive the Lord's Supper for them
in their Names alſo, and that be imputed to the
Children by virtue of their Parents Faith? And
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98169:79"/>
what <hi>though the Eſtate belongs to the Child in the
Cradle, together with the Indenture and Seals of that
Eſtate;</hi> Is it required the Child in the Cradle
should therefore ſet his Seal to the Indenture?
is that requiſite, or would it make the Estate
the more firm or ſure to him? But when you
can prove Grace and Salvation to be <hi>Hereditary,</hi>
and that the Father's being a Believer and a
godly Perſon, all his Children muſt needs be ſuch
too, you do your buſineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> But why do you ſay Children muſt
be Believers, or elſe they can't be ſaved? who
told you ſo?<note place="margin">Faith nor Baptiſm is not required of Infants, yet they may be ſaved.</note> Becauſe Faith in Adult Perſons is
required as neceſſary in them, if they are ſaved.
Can't God ſave poor Infants without they alſo
do believe? has God told you he cannot, or
will not ſave them except they believe? I muſt
confeſs I wonder at your Ignorance and daring
Boldneſs: God,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> p. 230.</note> as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> obſerves, <hi>may have
many ways to magnify his Grace through Jeſus
Chriſt to them which we know not of;</hi> and what
have you to do with the Secrets of God? who
made you one of his Privy-Council? you may
as well ſay, unleſs they repent they cannot be
ſaved from Chriſt's words, <hi>Luk</hi> 13. 3, 5. and
that they muſt be obedient and take up the
Croſs, for theſe things are required of Adult
Perſons that would be ſaved as well as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Prove that God has given Children
the Denomination of Believers; or if it was
granted he hath, would it therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> Act. 8. who are fit
Subjects of that Ordinance, or have a ſufficient
Title to it: and would not that believing (in
any ſenſe) you ſpeak of, that entitles them to
Salvation, give them as good a right to the
Lord's-Supper as to Baptiſm? Come, Sir, you
can't infer a right to an Ordinance from what
grounds you pleaſe. Baptiſm depends wholly, I
say again, upon the Authority of a poſitive Law,
and expreſs words of Inſtitution<note n="*" place="margin">I am forc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, becauſe there is the like occaſion given, and it is a full Anſwer to all ſuch Inferencse.</note>; and none
but ſuch who are made Diſciples by preaching,
or who do actually believe, ought from thence
to be baptized.</p>
            <p>I wonder what Faith 'tis you ſuppoſe to be
in Infants? is it the Faith of the Church, as
<hi>Tho. Aquinas</hi> aſſerts, which is intailed upon all
within the pale thereof? Or is it an <hi>Imputitive
Faith</hi> from the Parents in Covenant, as <hi>Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
and others maintain? Or, is it <hi>the Faith of the
Goſſip or Surety,</hi> as many of your Church ſay, <hi>i. e.</hi>
others believe for them? Have they a <hi>juſtifying
Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion is here among the Pedo-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts?</note> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> intimates? or a <hi>dogmatical

Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> obſerves, ſay 'tis a <hi>Phyſical,</hi> ſome
a <hi>Metaphyſical,</hi> and ſome a <hi>Hyperphyſical</hi> Faith.
Some ſay they are born Believers, others ſay
they are made Believers by Baptiſm. Now
when you tell us what Faith they have, we ſhall

                  </gap>, neither was he told ſo by any that
could tell. <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſaith he, Some ſay they
have Imputative Faith: But then ſo let the
Sacraments be too, that is, if they have the
Parents Faith or the Churches, then ſo let
Baptiſm be imputed alſo by derivation from
them: And as in their Mothers Womb, and
while they hang upon their Mothers Breaſts,
they live upon their Mothers Nouriſhment;
so they may upon the Baptiſm of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
or their Mother the Church: for ſince
Faith is neceſſary to the ſuſception of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
(and they themſelves confeſs it, by ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to find out new kinds of Faith to daub
the matter;) ſuch as the Faith, ſuch muſt be
the Sacrament: for there is no proportion
between an actual Sacrament, and an Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Faith, this being in immediate and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
order to that.</q> This ſaith the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</p>
            <p>We know there are ſome argue ſtifly for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
having habitual Faith; but as the ſaid

or conſequent to this pretended Habit?</hi> this
strange Invention, ſaith he, is abſolutely <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

But the Men are to be excuſed, unleſs they had
any better Arguments to defend their Practice;
they are forc'd to confeſs the Truth in the
main, <hi>viz.</hi> That Faith is required of Perſons to
be baptized, and therefore they do what they
can to prove Infants do believe. But I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this with what the ſaid Doctor further ſaith,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> p. 242.</note>
               <q>And if any Man runs for Succour to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded

If indeed our Saviour had declared that Infants

in the Worſhip and Service of God without
any expreſs Word dropt from Chriſt or his

is his Will and Mind it ought to be done, is
unlawful and no better than Will-worſhip.
Muſt Chriſt forbid Infant-Baptiſm? muſt he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
in plain words they ought not to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
or elſe may they, ought they to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized?
Is this good Divinity with Mr. <hi>Smythies?</hi>
Certainly this Man can't long keep out of the
Romiſh Communion: Hath our Saviour decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
indeed that you ſhall not have Crucifixes,
Beads, Altars, and that you ſhall not uſe Salt,
Spittle, Oil, or Chriſm in Baptiſm? that ye
shall not go on Pilgrimages, nor pray for the
Dead? Hath Chriſt, I ſay, or his Apoſtles, as
you read, forbid theſe things, and many more of
like nature? Or, did God forbid <hi>Nadab</hi> and
<hi>Abihu</hi> to <hi>offer ſtrange Fire,</hi> who were deſtroyed
for doing it? <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 1, 2. Did God forbid

forbid him to circumciſe his Male Children on
the ninth day? and might he therefore do theſe
things—becauſe God did no where tell him he
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98169:82"/>
ſhould not do ſo? The like might be ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Bowing at the naming of the Name of

and why not <hi>admit</hi> of other <hi>Rites</hi> and
<hi>Innovations</hi> as well as theſe? Moreover, what
expreſs word againſt Infants receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments?
Beſides, are Bells forbidden to be
baptized? hath Chriſt ſaid indeed, ye ſhall not
baptize Bells? is it therefore lawful to baptize
them? You will object, May be that <hi>Bells</hi> are
not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But why are they not? wherein are they
uncapable? Can you not ſprinkle a little Water
upon a Bell, and uſe the words of Inſtitution in
as ſolemn a manner as you do when you ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
a Child (baptize it as you ſay)? But are
they uncapable becauſe there is no word of
Inſtitution, nothing from the Mouth of Chriſt
or his Apoſtles, to juſtifie ſuch a Practice? We
ſay the ſame in reſpect of your baptizing
Children; and if you ſay, Bells are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the uſe and end of Baptiſm; we have
proved the like concerning Infants. If God had
pleaſed, he could have made them by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
capable of ſome ſacred uſefulneſs, yea
capable of Relative Holineſs or Conſecration, as
<hi>Aaron's Bells;</hi> Nay, and ſince we read of <hi>Bells of
the Horſes that ſhould be Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> Zech.
14. 20. Why may not that Text be a Proof
that Bells in Churches ſhould be baptized, and
so made holy likewiſe? There are thoſe you
know who plead for that Practice (and have
baptized them for many Ages) and they ſay
there is as much ground from Scripture to do
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98169:82"/>
that, as there is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>Sad it is that ſuch a Gap as this ſhould be
opened to all or any Inventions or Traditions

(Sir) is an horrible Sin, when he who is to
perform the Duty ſhall dare to appoint the
Laws: Implying a peremptory purpoſe of no
further obſervance, than may conſiſt with the
allowance of his own depraved Judgment and
Self-Intereſt; whereas true Obedience muſt be
grounded on the Authority of that Power that
commands not the liking or approbation of the

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a new kind of Argument, but
proves nothing.</p>
            <p>For firſt, 'Tis denied that Infants by any
Command of God were ever baptized in any
Nation, no not amongſt the Jews, much leſs
among the Gentile Nations; but if they had
been baptized before, he might as well have

ſaid, Can we imagine Chriſt would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
them from that, conſidering they were
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98169:84"/>
before admitted to the Paſſeover (which there
is no great cauſe to queſtion.)</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, We reaſon thus; If they were
before baptized, either they were baptized as
it was a Jewiſh Rite and Cuſtom, or elſe as an
Heatheniſh one: If Baptiſm of Infants before
was a Jewiſh Rite, it was either appointed of
God, or elſe a Tradition of their own: If it
was a Tradition of their own, can you ſuppoſe
our Saviour would go about to own and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
a Jewiſh Innovation, or one of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Traditions? and if it were an Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, it is very much that no Man
ever found it out before in all the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, If there had been any ſuch le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Ordinance, it had been abrogated, with all
other Jewiſh Ceremonies, <hi>which ſtood</hi> (as the
Apoſtle ſhews) <hi>in Meats and Drinks,</hi>

               <hi>and divers
Waſhings, and Carnal Ordinances impoſed on them
until the time of Reformation.</hi> All thoſe divers
Waſhings that were under the Law it is evident
ceaſed in the Eſtabliſhment of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and therefore how abominable falſe is
that which Mr. <hi>Smythies</hi> ſays concerning Goſpel-Baptiſm?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 5. <q>Our Saviour, (says he <hi>Pag.</hi> 88.)
took this Ordinance from the Cuſtom of the
Jews, who were wont to baptize thoſe who
forſook Heatheniſm and embraced the true
Religion. And whenſoever they made Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes,
they did not only baptize the Parent,
but the Child likewiſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Did any Man aſſert till now the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
of Chriſt to be a Legal Rite, or rather
that it ſprung from Human Tradition? for 'tis
evident the Jews were not required to baptize
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98169:84"/>
them by any Appointment of God: for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
was the Rite by which Proſelytes
(who were Males) were added to the Jewiſh
Church.</p>
            <p>Beſides, doth not our Saviour plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
that <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm was directly from
Heaven, and not of Men? And if Baptiſm had
been ſo frequently practiſed amongſt the Jews,
wherefore did they ſay to <hi>John, Why doſt thou
baptize, if thou art not that Chriſt, nor</hi> Elias?
<hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 25. But doth not Chriſt ſay, that the
Doctrine he taught, he received from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who ſent him? not from <hi>Moſes</hi> nor the
Jews:<note place="margin">John 12.</note> 
               <hi>I have not ſpoken</hi> (saith he) <hi>of my ſelf;
but the Father which ſent me, gave me Commandment
what I ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak.</hi> Now
Baptiſm is poſitively called a Principle of his
Doctrine,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1, 2, 3.</note> it was he that inſtituted it and gave it
forth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. as a pure Goſpel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
as the alone Soveraign Lord and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
of his Church. Moreover, if all thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Waſhings and carnal Ordinances amongſt
the Jews are aboliſhed, as you heard before;
how came this ſuppoſed Jewiſh Rite to eſcape?
Theſe things conſidered, we may perceive 'tis
Ignorance through Tradition that makes a Pedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt,
or rather a No-Baptiſt, <hi>and not Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
(as he affirms) <hi>through length of time that
makes an Anabaptiſt</hi> (falſly ſo called) <hi>Pag.</hi> 91.
But 'tis the knowledg of God's Word, through
the help of the Spirit, by which they, whom
he ſo calls, come to caſt off that unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>Babes Rantiſm,</hi> and to own no Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
but that which Chriſt hath commanded,
and was practiſed in the Apoſtolical Church.</p>
            <p>And whereas he affirms the baptizing of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

Cuſtom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And if the Cuſtom of the Church is enough
to juſtify Infant-Baptiſm, it will oblige us as to

likewiſe.</p>
            <p>

'tis an Invention of Men and no Ordinance of
Jeſus Chriſt? Beſides, were not the Phariſees

of God againſt themſelves, being not baptized?</hi>
God's purpoſe is to confound the Wiſdom of
Man. If Learning once comes to be made an

themſelves, and let them grope in Mid-day as
in the Night, notwithſtanding all their Light,
Knowledg, and Learning.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there are learned Men of all Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
many learned <hi>Cardinals, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet you will not make

few learned Men be of your way if it were a Truth,

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The more cauſe of Grief. But
what though I muſt tell you God's Word is
to be your Guide, and not Men: every Man
muſt give an account to God for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Moreover, ſome Godly Men who have had
great Light, and were glorious Reformers too
in their day, yet lay ſhort of ſome great
Things and Duties; as <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> &amp;c. who <hi>did
not remove nor pull down the high Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Light and Knowledg of Divine Truths
have broken forth <hi>gradually.</hi> When Reformation
firſt begun, thoſe godly Men laboured to reſtore
the doctrinal part of the Goſpel, and yet great
Corruptions remained in point of Diſcipline
(which Errors God hath ſince by degrees
diſcovered.)</p>
            <p>3. Had the beſt and late Reformers (for ſuch
you will find at laſt the Baptiſts to be in point
of the Adminiſtrations of God's Houſe and holy
Temple) been generally learned Men, 'tis very
like this Truth would have been more readily
received among ſuch (I mean learned Perſons)
than we ſee now it is, ſo hard a thing is Self-denial.</p>
            <p>4. Moreover, the baſe Reproaches caſt upon
the true way of Baptizing, hath doubtleſs laid a
great many of good Men under Temptations,
there being hardly any one Truth that has been
rendered more odious and contemptible than
Baptizing, (<hi>i e.</hi> dipping of Men and Women in

that no other Action then that was practiſed in

5. Some ſay thoſe Errors or unſound Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
(as I look upon them to be) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by divers Baptiſts (who I doubt not
are godly Chriſtians) have likewiſe hindred
the Reception and Promulgation of this bleſſed
Goſpel-Inſtitution among many worthy Perſons,<note place="margin">For the Doctrine of Free-will; Falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way totally from a ſtate of true Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not look'd upon as capital Errors, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as will exclude Men out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</note>
and kept them may be from indeavouring
their Satisfaction herein; tho 'tis ſtrange that
ſhould be a ſtumbling Block to any, ſith there
were many Chriſtians in the Apoſtles Times,
who in many things did diſſent and differ (in
as great matters) one from another: beſides,
there are Men almoſt of all Perſwaſions that
hold thoſe very Principles.</p>
            <p>6. Others think the Remiſneſs of ſome of the
Baptized Churches about taking care of their
Miniſters hath contributed ſomething to it alſo:
for nothing lies more clear in God's Word,
<hi>than that thoſe who preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of
the Goſpel;</hi> yea, have a comfortable Maintenance,
<hi>i. e.</hi> that they may be wholly ſequeſtred to the
Work of the Miniſtry (and be in a capacity to
give to others,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> and ſo ſhew themſelves Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in Hoſpitality); and that their poor Wives
and Children after their Deceaſe,<note place="margin">Matth. 10. 10.</note> may not be
expoſed to Want and Poverty. But I am glad
to ſee it,<note place="margin">Luk. 9. 3.</note> our Churches are now daily enlightned

joyn with us<note n="†" place="margin">Some good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are not willing to take up one Ordinance, and ſo joyn in with the Baptiſts, and thereby loſe another which they believe is as great, and a moſt ſweet and Soul-conſolating one.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:98169:87"/>
7. But to proceed: Be ſure the Examples of
the beſt Men under Heaven will never be a Plea
ſufficient for any in the day of Judgment, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing in God's Worſhip that he has not
commanded (or given grounds for the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of) or in their neglecting doing of that
which he hath expreſly required. Shall any be
allowed at the laſt day to plead thus, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch
and ſuch good Men and able Miniſters did ſay
this was a Truth and my Duty? ſurely no.</p>
            <p>8. When Reformation is required of Men in
so great a caſe as this, <hi>viz.</hi> that which tends
to the razing the whole Conſtitution or ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Church, which has been alſo of
ſuch a long continuation; it calls for great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
Courage, and Self-denial, which is hard
for ſome Men to arrive at; conſidering alſo what
great Perſons and Reformers have been on their
ſide; and they not ſeriouſly minding the words
of the wiſe Man,<note place="margin">Prov. 4. 18.</note> where he ſays, that <hi>the Path of
the Juſt is as a ſhining Light, that ſhineth more and
more to the perfect day;</hi> the Church as it was then
<hi>look'd out of the Wilderneſs but as the Morning, and but
as fair</hi> (comparatively) <hi>as the Moon;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant.</note> but ſince
(bleſſed be God) greater Light hath broken
forth, yea to ſuch a degree that now ſhe ſeems
to be come forth <hi>as clear as the Sun,</hi> &amp;c. And
ſad it is to ſee Men content themſelves to walk
only in that Light thoſe worthy Chriſtians had
in the Morning of the Reformation, and refuſe
to follow and embrace a higher and more clear,
and Sun-ſshining Glory. They might be accepted
then, ſince their Day did not afford greater Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations
of Truth in thoſe reſpects; but it may

is that by virtue of the Commiſſion, none were

to be baptized but ſuch as are diſcipled, or firſt
taught, before admitted to that Ordinance. If
the perſon be a Believer, we have no ground to

            <p>2. Can you prove that difference as to the ſtate

<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. By the authority of
which, the Apoſtles did baptize (and all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
ought to adminiſter the ſame Ordinance to
the end of the World.) The nature and order of
the Commiſſion cuts this Objection to pieces:
For if the perſon be a Diſciple, a Believer, he
is to be baptized, let his Parents be Jews, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98169:91"/>
they went, or whereſoever it was done,
it is no matter, they were baptized; which has

the Body in Water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſay what you will, the Baptiſm of
Infants is of God; for there was a multitude of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have ſhewed you that was but tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally

pure New-Teſtament Ordinance; tho 'tis like that
(as ſome Learned Men have ſaid) might be a
Type of this Ordinance, they being as it were
buried or overwhelmed in the Sea, and under
the Cloud. But if that may juſtifie Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
it will allow you to baptize Unbelievers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo;
for there was a multitude of mixt People
who went through the Sea with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> beſides
much Cattel, <hi>And a mixt multitude went up alſo
with them, and Flocks, and Herds, even very much
Cattel,</hi> Exod. 12. 38. All theſe were doubtleſs

do any harm to Infants, 'tis not till they are
grown up, and then it may be a means to blind
their Eyes, and cauſe ſome of them to conclude,
they in Baptiſm became the Children of God,
were regenerated, made Chriſtians, Members
of Chriſt, and Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven;
and cauſe others to think they were then rightly
baptized, and ſo to look after no other Baptiſm.
Whereas, poor Souls, they are all unbaptized

Men, to ignorant Babes, who neither

            <p>3. Is it not an evil thing to fruſtrate the ſacred

as you have heard; and by adminiſtring it to poor
Babes, render it wholly an Inſignificant thing?</p>
            <p>4. Is it not an evil and a ſhameful thing to
change <hi>Baptiſm</hi> into <hi>Rantiſm,</hi> from Dipping the

you not doing the thing? nor have any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
ſo to do, nor to baptize Children at all,
much leſs to ſprinkle them.</p>
            <p>5. Is it not an evil and harmful thing, and a

            <p>6. Is it not a fooliſh thing and a Lye, to ſay,

As if it were in the power, and at the will of the
Parents to ſave or damn their Children. For
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98169:92"/>
this is intimated by this Notion of yours; If the
Parents or Friends baptize the Child, it ſhall (if
it die in its Infancy) be ſaved; but if they, nor
no other, indeavour to get it Baptized, the
Child is loſt, and muſt periſh.—<q>How can out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

How can Water, a material thing,
work upon the Soul in a Phyſical manner?
Neither can it be proved, That ever the Spirit
of God is tied by any Promiſe, to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the Soul in its Gracious Operations,
when the Body is applied to the Water.</q> (He
ſays, Water applied to the Body.) Becauſe the

the Word) cannot be ſaved without Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Can't God ſave poor dying Infants, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the ſame change by the Spirits Operations
paſs upon them? Is not God <hi>a free Agent?</hi> may he
not do what he pleaſes, and magnifie his Grace
to poor dying Infants, through the Blood of his
Son, in other ways than we know of? Do not
ſecret things belong to him, what Vanity is there
in the minds of ſome Men?</p>
            <p>8. Has God ordained Baptiſm to be an Ordinance
to ſave the Souls of any Perſons, either the
Adult or Infants? is the <hi>Opus operatum</hi> of Baptiſm,
think you, a likely way or means to beget or
bring forth Children to Chriſt, or make Diſciples
of them? Baptiſm ſignifies no thing (it being

it is wanting.</p>

Death, Burial, and Reſurrection, and yet do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſprinkle, or pour a little Water upon
the Face; by which act, all muſt confeſs nothing
of ſuch things can thereby be repreſented?</p>
            <p>19. Is it not a ſtrange and fooliſh thing to ſay,
Baptiſm is <hi>an Ordinance of the Solemnization of the
Souls Marriage with Chriſt, and to ſay, 'tis a ſtrange
Marriage where nothing is profeſſed of a Conſent;</hi> and
yet adminiſter it to Babes wholly uncapable ſo
to do?</p>
            <p>20. Is it not a fooliſh thing to cry out againſt
Traditions, and all Inventions of Men, and yet
ſtrive to uphold and maintain them? And doth
not theſe things hinder that glorious Reformation
we all long for, and encourage <hi>Papiſts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21. Is it not ſtrange Men ſhould ſay, all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Believersare in Covenant, and that there
is no falling from a State of Grace; but that the
New Covenant is ſo well ordered in all things,
and ſure, that it will ſecure all that are indeed in
it unto Eternal Life; and yet many of theſe
Children, who they ſay, were in this Covenant,
periſh in their Sins, dying Unregenerate?</p>
            <p>22. We will conclude this Chapter, as Mr.
<hi>Danvers</hi> does with the words of Dr. <hi>Taylor.</hi>
               <q>And therefore,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> Lib. Proph. <hi>p.</hi> 244.</note> ſaith he, whoever will perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly

            <head>CHAP. XIV. Proving Baptiſm a great and glorious
Ordinance, and that 'tis initiating or an
In-let into the Church.</head>
            <p>THE laſt thing I ſhall do, is to prove Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
Baptiſm a very great and glorious
Ordinance, though much deſpiſed by Men, nay
by many Profeſſors of this Age.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, 'Tis <hi>a Principle of Chriſt's Doctrine,</hi>
nay, <hi>a Foundation-Principle, viz.</hi> of a true Goſpel-Church-State;
ſo that according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
and Primitive-Inſtitution, a Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be truly gathered without it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It appears to be a great Ordinance,
if we conſider the Commiſſion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Conſider with what Authority our Saviour
gave it forth;</hi> All Power is given to me in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth: Go ye therefore, teach all Nations,
baptizing them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In that it was one of the laſt things he
gave in charge to his Diſciples before he went
to Heaven. And,</p>
            <p>3. In that he joyns it to Teaching, expreſſing
no other Goſpel-Ordinances beſides, though he
gave other Commandments to them, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>4. In that no Ordinance is to be adminiſtred
in a more ſolemn manner than this is, <hi>viz. in
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
holy Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:98169:95"/>
We are hereby obliged to believe in, adore,
and worſhip the whole Trinity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, No Ordinance in all the New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
was ever ſo grac'd, nor honoured with
ſuch a Preſence as this was at the Baptiſm of
Chriſt; the three Perſons manifeſt their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
at this Solemnity, <hi>the Heavens were opened,
and a voice heard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>ſaying, This is my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> 1. The Father ſeals it
and honours it. 2. The Son is there, and ſubjects
to it, ſhewing what an honourable reſpect he
has to it; nay and came many Miles upon no
other Buſineſs but to be baptized (as we read
of.) 3. The Spirit alſo <hi>deſcended like a Dove,
and reſted upon him;</hi> the Holy Ghoſt puts his
Seal upon it, and in a glorious manner owns it.</p>
            <p>And then our Saviour ſaith, it became him
to be obedient to it; 'tis, it ſeems, a becoming
Ordinance, it became the Maſter, and doth it
not become the Servant to ſubmit to it? It
was not too low for him, and is it too low for
thee?</p>
            <p>He ſaid alſo it was a fulfilling of all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;
that is, it became him to fulfil all the
Commands of his Father, or do his whole Will,
which it appears he could not have done unleſs
he had been baptized.</p>
            <p>And in that of being a Patern or Example
to us, thoſe who neglect it, neglect a moſt
righteous thing, and do not fill up after their
Maſter.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, 'Tis called <hi>a juſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ying of God,</hi> and
our Diſobedience herein <hi>a rejecting the Counſel of
God,</hi> Luk. 7. 29, 30.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It appears a great Ordinance, in that
the higheſt, nay the extraordinary Gifts of the
Spirit can't exempt a Perſon from his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98169:95"/>
hereto, as appears in <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s caſe. Nay,
the greater Gifts and Graces a Perſon hath, the
more fit a Subject he is of this Ordinance (as
<hi>Peter</hi>'s words do import.<note place="margin">Act. 10. 47.</note>)</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Conſider the great things and Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
held forth hereby, <hi>viz.</hi> the Death, Burial,
and Reſurrection of Chriſt, and our dying to
Sin, and Duty to walk in newneſs of Life, it
preaches the Goſpel to our very ſight in a
very lively Figure; and therefore a great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, 'Tis a Badg of Chriſtian Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and an Ordinance, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> obſerves,
of the Solemnization of the Souls Marriage-Union
with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Conſider the great Promiſes made to
thoſe who are obedient to it, amongſt other
things,<note place="margin">Mark 16. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of
the World.</hi> And again, <hi>He that believeth, and is
baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> If a Prince ſhall offer a
Rebel his Life in doing two things, would he
neglect one of them, and ſay this I will do,
but the other is a trivial thing, I'll not do that?
Surely no, he would not run the hazard of his
Life ſo fooliſhly.</p>
            <p>And then in <hi>Act. 2. 38. Repent, and be baptized
every one of you for Remiſſion of Sin, and ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Gift of the Holy Spirit:</hi> See what great
Promiſes are made to Believers in <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ninthly, Nay, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> was warn'd from
Heaven to ſend for <hi>Peter,</hi> and, ſaith the Lord,
he <hi>ſhall tell thee what thou ſhalt do.</hi> Now one
thing that is expreſt, and I think 'tis all that
<hi>Pet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> told him he ſhould <hi>do</hi> (beſides believing
on the Lord Jeſus) was to <hi>be baptized.</hi> Certainly
theſe things demonſtrate Baptiſm to be a great
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98169:96"/>
Ordinance; 'tis miraculouſly confirmed from
Heaven (as it were) ſo to be.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, and laſtly; Baptiſm is an <hi>initiating
Ordinance,</hi> no regular or orderly coming into
the Church of God but at this door; and this
we ſhall make appear, therefore a great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> 'Tis ſaid <hi>they that gladly received the
Word, were baptized; and the ſame day there were
added to them about three thouſand Souls:</hi> thoſe
who were added unto this Church were firſt
baptized; and obſervable 'tis, that as this was
the firſt Goſpel-Church that was gathered after
the Ascenſion of Chriſt: ſo it is ſet forth
as a Patern to all other Churches;<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2. 14.</note> for as others
were injoyned, ſo they were commanded for

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> All along in the New Teſtament,
where we read of the firſt Plantations of the
Churches, we find that all thoſe who became
Members reſpectively, were firſt upon their

            <p>
               <hi>That is, into his Church or Myſtical Body,

               <hi>By one Spirit we</hi> (are ſaid) <hi>all to be baptized
into one Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12, 13, <hi>By one Spirit,</hi> that
is, by the Authority and Appointment of the
Spirit, and by the Guidance, Conduct, and
Leadings of the Spirit; not that all that are true
Members of the Church are baptized with the
holy Spirit, ſith the Baptiſm of the Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
(as we have elſewhere proved) the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Gifts or Effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt,
which was received in the Apoſtles days, and
which continued not in the Church. <hi>And have
been all made to drink into one Spirit.</hi> In theſe
words he alludes to the Ordinance of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
which you may as well ſay, is a ſpiritual

Baptiſm; becauſe 'tis ſaid <hi>by</hi> one Spirit we are
all baptized, 'tis not ſaid <hi>with</hi> one Spirit. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
ſhould any aſſert that the Apoſtle means
the Baptiſm of the Spirit, and that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Gifts and Graces of the Spirit is the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
of the Holy Spirit; then it would follow
that there are two Baptiſms left in the Church,
which ſeems to be contrary to what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Becauſe the Lord Jeſus hath joyned
Faith and Baptiſm together in the Commiſſion,
and both were taught as beginning or fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Principles of his Doctrine, or part of thoſe
firſt Rudiments that belongs to every Babe in
Chriſt, or Chriſtian Man and Woman, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.

                  <hi>Pool</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notat. on <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2.</note> as
our late Annotators affirm, are initiating, and ſo
they muſt be; for if they are Fundamentals, they
muſt either be Fundamentals of Salvation, or elſe
of Church-Communion: Now Baptiſm cannot
be a Fundamental of Salvation, therefore of
Church-Communion, how neceſſary 'tis to lay a
sure Foundation no Man can be ignorant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:98169:97"/>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It is objected from <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. that but
some only of the Church of the <hi>Romans</hi> were
baptized, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>as many of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
you as were baptized,</hi> &amp;c. from thence they would
conclude ſome of them were not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Did the whole Church of the <hi>Romans</hi>
reckon themſelves, think you, to be dead to Sin,
and bound to live no longer therein? If ſo, then
Baptiſm, which was a Symbol of thoſe things,
belonging to them all; <hi>As many as are baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt, were baptized into his Death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> in
token of it: And that they all ſhould become
New Creatures, it is as if he ſhould reaſon
thus;</p>
            <p>As many of us as are baptized, muſt know
this, that we were baptized into Chriſt's Death,
and therefore muſt die to Sin, and live a new
Life. But we have all been baptized or buried
with Chriſt in Baptiſm into his Death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt all die to Sin, and live a new Life.</p>
            <p>Did the Apoſtle intend hereby, do you think,
to preſs them all to die to Sin, and live to God?
if ſo, that Argument he uſes (you may aſſure
your ſelves) reached them all, which it could not
do if they had not all been baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Baptiſm is an initiating Ordinance,
appears, becauſe the way of inchurching Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
or Men and Women, was one and the
same in all the Churches of the Saints; if ſome
were not received till Baptized, there were no
unbaptized Perſons ever received at all. But
some were not received till baptized, <hi>Ergo.</hi> The
Reaſon is not only, becauſe the way and order of
the Adminiſtration of that Ordinance were one
and the ſame in every Church, and ſo Confuſion
avoided; but alſo becauſe there is the like parity
of Reaſon, why all ſhould and ought to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98169:97"/>
as there is for ſome, ſith the Ordinance
is initiating, and ſo a great Priviledg, and all
have right to the thing ſignified thereby: Beſides,
thoſe who believe, are required and commanded
to be baptized; and that which is the Duty of
one Diſciple as a Diſciple, is the Duty of every
Diſciple; and by that Argument you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
one Man from one Sacrament, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm,
you may excuſe another from the Lord's Table,
upon a pretence he doth not ſee it to be his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and yet admit him, and continue him a
Member.</p>
            <p>And that Baptiſm is an initiating Ordinance,
we have all Chriſtians of all Perſwaſions one
with us, they generally aſſert the ſame thing.</p>

or <hi>Independants,</hi> admit any as Members in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Communions, as to partake of the Lord's
Supper, except they have been baptized in their
senſe, they calling Sprinkling, or Pouring, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing;</hi>
which we deny to be the Ordinance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> How dare you deny a Man admittance into
the Church, who is truly Godly, and hath a lively
Faith? If he hath a right to Chriſt, who is ſignified
in the Lord's Supper, may be be denied the Sign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is not baptized?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> How dares any Man, who fears God,
attempt to do any thing contrary to the Holy
Pattern left in Chriſt's New Teſtament? If
Baptiſm was appointed to be an Initiating Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
into God's Houſe, 'tis not only a Man's Piety
that will ſerve the turn, he muſt come into the
Church at the Door Chriſt hath ordained, or not
come in at all. If <hi>Lot</hi> ſhould have offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to come into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, (which was
then God's Church) do you think <hi>Abraham</hi>
would have admitted him, (though he was a
Righteous Man) unleſs he would firſt conſent to
be Circumciſed (which was an Initiating Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
at that time)? Certainly, no; though he
ſhould ſay he was not convinced of Circumciſion,
yet that would not have excuſed him: God's
Laws are not to be diſpenſed with to gratify the
Ignorance of Men. 'Tis a Queſtion whether
<hi>Vzzah</hi> knew he ought not to put forth his Hand
to ſupport the Ark: Yet for doing that thing, God
smote him with Death. Ignorance will not be
a ſufficient Plea for doing God's Work,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 6, 7.</note> in other
manner than he has appointed.</p>
            <p>How dares any Man, who loves and deſires to
honour the Lord Jeſus, violate his Holy and Great
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98169:134"/>
Commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. or act and do contrary
thereto, who requires all Diſciples to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed?
derogating from the Rule in one thing,
opens a Gap to other Diſorders, and it renders
Chriſt's Inſtitution a petty and indifferent thing:
you may as well diſpenſe (with the neglect, or)
with the ignorance of Men in the Lord's Supper,
as well as ſo to do in reſpect of Baptiſm; and let
them abide Members who refuſe to break Bread
with the Church, and yet would continue Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
pretending ignorance; perhaps they will
tell you, they can anſwer the End of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in breaking their common Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 1.</note> But doth not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Such as
are weak in the Faith, receive you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. It cannot be meant received into the Church,
becauſe they that the Apoſtle there ſpeaks of, were
in the Faith, or viſible Profeſſion of the Goſpel,
and were Members of the Church, tho they were
weak ones, or but Babes in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. The weakneſs there meant, was about eating
Meats, and obſerving days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were in
themſelves but indifferent things: And will you
render the great Sacrament of Baptiſm like to
them? It was no Sin to eat, or not to eat, but ſo
it is not to be ſubject, or not ſubject to Chriſt's
Ordinances.</p>
            <p>3. The receiving there intends doubtleſs no
more than this, to let them abide in their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or receive them as poor weak Children to
nouriſh and pity them, and not to cenſure and
judg hardly of their doubtful thoughts.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, ſince my honoured Friend and
Brother, Mr. <hi>William Kiffen,</hi> hath but lately wrote
ſo excellent a Book upon this very Subject, I ſhall
ſay no more to it, but refer the Reader for his
further ſatisfaction to that Treatiſe. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98169:134"/>
to a little Improvement: If Baptiſm be ſo
great an Ordinance as it ſeems it is, this may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
all ſuch who ſlight and diſpiſe it, and may
stir up all to an honourable eſteem of it, and to
move ſuch who are convinc'd of it, ſpeedily to
submit thereunto.</p>
            <p>Let me conclude all with one uſe of Caution to
my Brethren, that are baptized as Believers, and
yet take liberty to walk in Communion with ſuch
Churches as diſſent from them, in reſpect of this
Ordinance, and ſprinkle Babes.</p>
            <p>I am more concerned about you, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
People; becauſe you ſeem to pull down with
one Hand, that which you Build with the other.
Our Brethren with whom you Walk, may be
more Excuſable than you can be, becauſe they
are faithful (I would hope) to their Light;
they will not have communion with any Perſons,
whom they judg in their Conſciences are Unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized;
but you believe thoſe who have been only
Sprinkled in Infancy, are all Unbaptized Perſons,
or otherwiſe why were you Baptized afterwards?
Who can juſtifie you in this Practice? I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
our Brethren cannot, will not do it, if
they rightly conſider the light or dictates of your
Conſciences in this Matter: 'tis not what they are
in their own Senſe, but what they are in your
Judgment. Speak, are they Baptized? Or, is
not that they call Baptiſm, in your Conſciences a
Nullity? Nay, worſe, a Tradition of Men? nay,
a prophanation of the Sacrament of Baptiſm?
How then can you juſtify your ſelves in ſuch a
Practice? I have as much charity for our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
I hope, as moſt of you have, and love
and honour them, yet dare not tranſgreſs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
Chriſt's holy Laws, and Goſpel-Order; and
therefore take heed what you do. If there were
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98169:135"/>
no Baptized Churches with whom you might
have Communion, ſomewhat might be ſaid in
your Juſtification. (For upon a caſe of neceſſity
that may be lawful, or be permitted to be done,
which otherwiſe is utterly unlawful.) Beſides, I
hear ſome of you (daily confeſs) they believe
they are not ſuch Orderly Churches as the Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
Congregations are, (and that is the ſum of what
I ſay and believe concerning them) why then do
you chuſe to have Fellowſhip with them? Ought
you not to follow the beſt and higheſt Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and cleareſt Diſcovery of God, and to be in
the moſt perfect and compleat Order of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
you are able to arrive to the knowledg of?
Yet are not you contented to lie ſhort in doing
this according to the Sentiments of your Minds
and Underſtandings? Is this the way to that
longed-for Reformation? Is not Truth and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
to be joyned with Peace and Love?
Nay, and doth not my Love run out to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in a cleaner Channel than yours, (who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
my Affections ſhall never pilot my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Underſtanding?) I have as great reaſon
to love and honour ſome of the Congregational
Way, as any one Man this day in <hi>England;</hi> it
pleaſing God to work upon my Soul, I hope, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually,
when very young under the Miniſtry
of one that is of that Perſuaſion, who is yet
living, and none of the meaneſt Miniſters, now
Preaching near this City; whoſe Name is dear
to me, and one I do honour, (and ever ſhall)
as long as I live in the World. Yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
my bleſſed Lord and Saviour, and his Truth,
lies nearer my Heart. I ſpeak the more upon
this account, not only to deliver your Souls from
Temptations, and diſorderly Walking; but alſo,
becauſe I know it grieves many very gracious
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98169:135"/>
Perſons, and weakens the hands of thoſe who
carry on the Work of God amongſt us; and
seems to me to obſtruct the further Glory and
Reformation of the Church. Yet I am for ſuch
Communion with our Brethren, as we may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably
promote, as to Pray and Preach toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to love and encourage Grace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
in one another.</p>
            <p>I'll ſay no more, I have done; only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that excellent ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>Now I
pray you, Brethren, that ye remember me in all things,
and keep the Ordinances as I delivered them to you.</hi>
Would to God I could ſay ſo of you. 'Tis not
enough to keep the Ordinances of Chriſt, but ſo
to keep them as at firſt delivered to the Saints.
Let us go forward, and not decline, or ſeem to
draw back in our Zeal and Teſtimony for the
Truth. Let us walk as we have attained; God
may bring our Brethren to ſee wherein they come
short, as well as wherein they know they are
got before others. I hope, what I have written
will be received in good part, and none will be
offended; for I can appeal to God, the ſearcher
of all Hearts, I have done all that I have done
or writ in this Treatiſe, in the integrity and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righneſs
of my Heart, and in ſincere love to
Chriſt and his diſpiſed Ordinances, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
my Conſcience; hoping a Bleſſing will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it, and that it will redownd to his Glory, and
the profit of his Church; and if ſo, I matter
not what Cenſures I lie under: For, <hi>my Record
is on high,</hi> and <hi>my Witneſs is in Heaven.</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to be any thing or nothing, (if I know
my own deceitful Heart) that God may be All
in all; to whom be Praiſe and Glory, by Jeſus
Chriſt, now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
