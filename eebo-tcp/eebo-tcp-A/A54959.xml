            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>By your kind presence, to be kept alive!</l>
               <l>W' have still new things, or old ones we revive;</l>
               <l>We plot, and strive to bring them first o'th' Stage,</l>
               <l>Like wary Pilot for his Weather-gage.</l>
               <l>W' have <hi>Every Act,</hi> and every week a Play;</l>
               <l>Nay, w' have had new ones studied for one Day;</l>
               <l>W' have double Duty, and w' have but half Pay.</l>
               <l>VV' have scaling Monkies, and w' have dancing Swans,</l>
               <l>To match our nimble cap'ring Chairs and Stands:</l>
               <l>There Opera's with, and here without Machines:</l>
               <l>Here, Scenes well wrought, and there, well painted Scenes;</l>
               <l>Castles and Men i'th' Air, the <hi>World l'th' Moon,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Where you, like Swallows fly, but soon y'are gone.</l>
               <l>W've something ev'ry different Taste to hit,</l>
               <l>I gad, I think, w' have ev'ry thing but Wit;</l>
               <l>For w' have full Scenes, and w' have an empty Pitt.</l>
               <l>Faith, Sirs, we scarce cou'd hope, you here wou'd be</l>
               <l>So num'rous, tho' we have a new Comedy.</l>
               <l>For there's in Plays, you know, a Reformation</l>
               <l>(A thing to which y' have no great inclination)</l>
               <l>I fear you'll seek some loser Occupation.</l>
               <l>From those Lewd Poets all these mischiefs flow;</l>
               <l>They, like <hi>Drawcansirs,</hi> maul'd both Friend and Foe.</l>
               <l>Wou'd they'd been serv'd like their Plays long ago!</l>
               <l>All cautious Dons and Matrons hence they scar'd,</l>
               <l>And all this did they do, <hi>because they dar'd.</hi>

               <l>The more they lash'd you, you seem'd tickled most.</l>
               <l>But now no Luscious Scenes must lard their Plays:</l>
               <l>No Lady now will need to hide her face;</l>
               <l>But I'll be hang'd if one i'th' Gallery stays.</l>
               <l>To hear ill-natur'd Truths no more you'll sit,</l>
               <l>But mortifie an inoffensive Wit;</l>

               <l>No Bawdy, this can't be a Women's Play.</l>
               <l>Nay, I confess there's Cause enough to doubt,</l>

                  <p>Because excess of drinking cloys my Stomach, and Impudence in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men absolutely turns it; then I hate the vanity of Dress and Fluttering, where eternal Noise and Nonsence reigns; this consider'd, what should I do here?</p>

                  <p>The third is, not a Whore, but a brisk airy, noisy Coquette, that lives upon treating, one Spark has her to the Play, another to the Park, a third to <hi>Windsor,</hi> a fourth to some other place of Diversion; She has not the heart to grant 'em all favours, for that's their design at the bottom of the Treats, and they have not the heart to marry her, for that's her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign too Poor Creature. So perhaps a year, or it may be two, the gaudy Butterfly slutters round the Kingdom, then if a foolish Citt does not take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, sneaks into a Corner, dies an Old Maid, despised and forgotten. The Men that sit those Ladies are your Rake, your Cully, and your Beaux.</p>

                  <p>Bedlam, o're this, had been my proper mansion if your sweet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had not composed my jarring thoughts, and given the warring Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Intervals of rest.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Beau.</speaker>
                  <p>I must confess, tho I am wild to the very verge that Innocence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50316:5"/>
allows, yet when my Uncle, that dear good man, told me, if e'er I meant to oblige him I must be a Companion, Friend, and Lover of his Mistress. The propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition startled me, but then I did not think there had been such a Mistress as my <hi>Bellinda,</hi> nor Platonick Love in real practice.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
                  <p>True, my dear Friend, our Love is to the Modern Age, unpractic'd and unknown; yet so strict and so severe, are rigid Honour's Laws, that tho' not grosly, yet we still offend: had not Fate fixt a bar unpassable between us, how shou'd I'have blest the accident that brought us first acquainted.</p>

                  <p>In short, 'twas thus; coming from the Play, mask'd with a Young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, a fluttering Fellow seized me, and spight of my intreaties grew rudely troublesome; I was never used to such Behaviour, and it throughly frighted me; Sir <hi>Charles</hi> being near, saw my unfeigned concern, and generously made the Brute desist, then led me safely to a Coach, observing where I bid the Coachman drive, he came to wait upon me, my fair Friend agen was with me and 'twas by her perswasions that I saw him: we found his conversation nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly civil and full of Innocent delight, I blush'd, and fondly thought this man my Amorous Stars in kindness destin'd for my happiness, but oh!—</p>

                  <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
                  <p>Therein I only can accuse him of deceit: He kept his marriage a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Secret till I had lost the power to banish him.</p>

                  <p>Only this I'll tell you, Madam, and as a warning never resolve, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you think it fully in your power, to keep your resolution.

                  <p>For Humane Laws, I know not what to say, but sure Heaven had no concern, 'twas a detested match.
