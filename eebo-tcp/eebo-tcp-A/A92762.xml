            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Numerous and Active Army cloſely beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us hath rendred me, and thoſe engaged with me, (in regard of perpetuall duty, without reliefe of Guards for five weeks together) incapable of preſenting your Lordſhip with an exact Relation thereof; I can therefore hint it only for a better Mercury. The Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Gentry, (whereof I ſhall ſend a Liſt) Clergy, Citizens, and Common Souldiers, behaved themſelves all gallantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their duty, many eminently; to particularize each, would be too great a treſpaſſe on your Lordſhips more weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. Briefly beleeve me (my Lord) the walls of their vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant breaſts were all ſtrongly lined with Courage and Loyalty.</p>
            <p>On the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> I ſent out a Party of 20 Horſe over <hi>Wye-bridge,</hi> who diſcovering their Forlorne-hope of Horſe, charged them into their maine Body; and retreated in very little diſorder, and with loſſe only of one Trooper, (taken Priſoner) ſome of the <hi>Scots</hi> falling. Immediatly after this, their whole Body of Horſe faced us, about ten of the Clock in the morning within the reach of our Cannon, and were wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed with our mettall; good execution being done upon them, their Foot as yet undiſcovered. About halfe an houre after, I cauſed a ſtrong Party of Foot (ſeconded with Horſe) to line the hedges, who galled them in their paſſage to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113223:3"/>
Fords, after whoſe handſome retreat, I began to enſafe the Ports, which I did that night. In the morning, appeared their Body of Foot, and we found our ſelves ſurrounded. I injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Bells ſilence, leaſt their ringing, which was an Alarme to awaken our devotion, might Chime them together to the execution of their malice. For the ſame reaſon, I ſtopt our Clocks, and hereby though I prevented their telling tales, to the advantage of the Enemy, I my ſelfe loſt the punctuall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of many particulars, which therefore I muſt more confuſedly repreſent unto your Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>Before they attempted any thing againſt the Towne, they invited us to a Surrendry, and this they did by a double Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, one from <hi>Leven,</hi> directed to me; the other from the Committee of both Kingdomes (attending upon the affaires of the Army) ſent to the Major and Corporation: but we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed ſo well in our Reſolutions, that our poſitive Anſwer ſerved for both Parties, which was returned by me to their Generall.</p>
            <p>This not giving that ſatisfaction they deſired, they began to approach upon the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> but very ſlowly and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly; as yet intending more the ſecurity of their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, then the ruine of ours: but all their Art could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them from our ſmall and great ſhot which fell upon them. Beſides this, our men galled them handſomly at their ſeverall Sallies, over <hi>Wyebridge,</hi> once beat them up to their maine guard, and at another demoliſht one ſide of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Martins</hi> Steeple; which would have much annoyed us at the Bridge and Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; this was performed with the hurt only of two men, but with loſſe of great ſtore of the Enemies men.</p>
            <p>When they ſaw how difficult the Service would prove, before they could compaſſe their deſignes by force, they made uſe of another Engine which was flattery. The Major and Aldermen are courted to yeeld the Towne by an Epiſtle, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by ſix of the Country Gentlemen, very compaſſionate and ſuaſory: but upon our refuſall to ſtoup to this lure, they were much incenſed that they had been ſo long diſappointed, and having all this while continued their line of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113223:3"/>
they raiſed their Batteries, commencing at <hi>Wyebridge,</hi> from whence they received the greateſt dammage, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of revenging that loſſe upon us, they multiplied their owne, by the death of their much lamented Major Generall <hi>Crafford,</hi> and ſome others that fell with him. This provoked them to play hot upon the Gate for two dayes together, and battered it ſo much, (being the weakeſt) that it was rendred uſeleſſe, yet our men ſtopt it up with Wooll-ſacks and Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and for our greater aſſurance of eluding their attempt, we brake an Arch, and raiſed a very ſtrong Worke behind it.</p>
            <p>The Enemy fruſtrate of his hopes here, raiſeth two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Batteries, one at the <hi>Fryers,</hi> the other on the other ſide of <hi>Wye</hi> River, and from both theſe, playes his Ordinance againſt the corner of the wall by <hi>Wye</hi> ſide, but we repaire and line our walls faſter then they can batter them, whereupon they deſiſt.</p>
            <p>About the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> we diſcover a Mine at <hi>Frein-gate,</hi> and imploy workmen to countermine them. When we had ſtopt the progreſſe of that Mine on one ſide of the Gate, they carried it on the other; which we alſo defeated by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Sally-port: and iſſuing forth did break it open and fire it.</p>
            <p>About the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, they raiſe Batteries round about the Town, and make a Bridge over <hi>Wye</hi> River.</p>
            <p>The 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, Doctor <hi>Scudamore</hi> is ſent by them to deſire ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance for three Country Gentlemen, who pretended in their Letters to import ſomething of conſequence to the good of the City and County, free leave of ingreſſe and egreſſe was allowed them, but being admitted, their ſuggeſtions were found to us ſo frivolous and impertinent, that they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſd, not without ſome diſreliſh and neglect: and the ſaid Doctor, after they were paſt the Port, comming back from his company, was unfortunately ſlaine by a ſhot from the Enemy.</p>
            <p>About the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, they diſcover the face of their Battery againſt <hi>Frein-gate,</hi> with five ſeverall gun-ports, from hence they played foure Cannon joyntly at our walls, and made a breach, which was inſtantly made up; they doe the like on the other ſide with the like ſucceſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:113223:4"/>
The 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, a notable Sally was made at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Owens</hi> Church with great execution, and divers Priſoners taken with the loſſe only of one man, at which time little boyes ſtrived, which ſhould firſt carry Torches and Faggots to fire their works, which was performed to ſome purpoſe, and ſo it was at the ſame Sally-port once before, though with a fewer number, and therefore with leſſe execution.</p>
            <p>And I may not forget to acquaint your Lordſhip with thoſe other foure Sallies, made by us at the Caſtle to good effect, and what emulation there was between the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and Citizens, which ſhould be moſt ingaged in them: Now their loſſe of Priſoners, ſlaughter of men, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of being beaten out of their works, which they found ready to flame about their eares if they returned preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, had ſo kindled their indignation, that preſently they rayſed Batteries againſt Saint <hi>Owens</hi> Church, and plaid fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at it, but to little purpoſe, which they ſo eaſily perceived, that from the 20. unto the 27. there was a great calme on all ſides, we as willing to provide our ſelves, and preſerve our ammunition for a ſtorme, as they could be induſtrious or mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to bring it upon us: yet I cannot ſay either ſide was Idle; for they ply'd their Mine at Saint <hi>Owens,</hi> and prepared for Scaling, we countermined, imploy'd our boyes by day and night to ſteale out and fire their Works; ſecuring their retreat under the protection of our Muſquetiers upon the wall, and what our fire could not perfect, though it burnt farre, and ſuffocated ſome of their Miners, our water did, breaking in upon them and drowning that which the fire had not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and this ſaved us the pains of purſuing a mine, which we had ſunk on purpoſe to reader theirs in that place ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall.</p>
            <p>The 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>Leven</hi> (a mercifull Generall) aſſayes the Towne againe by his laſt offer of honourable conditions to ſurrender, but he found us ſtill unrelenting, the terror of his Cannon, making no impreſſion at all upon our Spirits, though the bullets diſcharged from them, had done ſo much againſt our walls: this (though ſome of their chiefe Commanders
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113223:4"/>
were remiſſe and coole at the debate and ſome contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) drives their greateſt ſpirits into a paſſionate reſolution of ſtorming.</p>
            <p>And to that purpoſe <hi>Auguſt</hi> 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and <hi>September.</hi> 1. they prepare Ladders, hurdles, and other accommodations for the advancing their deſigne, and ſecuring their perſons in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and played very hot with their Cannon upon <hi>Byſters</hi> gate, and the halfe moon next Saint <hi>Owens</hi> gate, intending the morrow after to fall on, preſuming as they boaſted, that after they had rung us this paſſing peale, they ſhould preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly force the Garriſon to give up her Loyall Ghoſt, but the ſame night His Majeſty advancing from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> gave them a very hot alarum, and drawing a little neerer to us, like the Sunne to the Meridian, this Scottiſh miſt beganne to diſperſe, and the next morning vaniſhed out of ſight. My Lord, I ſhould give your Lordſhip an accompt of the valor of our common Souldiers and Towneſmen, that would hazard themſelves at the making up of breaches (to the aſtoniſhment of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, till their Cannon played between their leggs, and even the Women (ſuch was their gallantry) ventred where the Muſquet bullets did ſo, and I ſhould acquaint your Honour, what frequent alarums we gave them by fire-balls, lights up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Steeple, by Dogs, Cats, and outworne Horſes, having light Matches tyed about them; and turned out upon their works, whereby we put the enemy in ſuch diſtraction, that ſometimes they charged one another; this recreation we had in the middeſt of our beſiedging: and one morning, inſtead of beating Reveillie, we had a crye of Hounds, in purſuit after the traine of a Fox about the Walls of the Citty, ſo little were we diſmaied at the threats or attempts of them. I may not forget one remarkable peece of Divine Providence, that God ſent us ſingular men of all profeſſions, very uſefull, and neceſſary for us in this diſtreſſe, and ſo accidentally to us, as if they had on purpoſe been let downe from Heaven, to ſerve our preſent and emergent occaſions: as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
