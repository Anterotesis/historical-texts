            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS Diſcourſe which was at firſt haſtily
Compos'd, whilſt I was a Candidate for

into the hands of <hi>Thoſe Men,</hi> who were always
juſtly eſteemed as a moſt Accompliſh'd and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
Part of the Engliſh Nation. But this being
the firſt Command with which You were pleaſed to

imprudent Earneſt of my future Obſervance. If Your
Choice of this occaſional and peculiar Subject, cannot
exempt my Performance from the Cenſures of other

Protection. That I am now happily Entitled to it, I
can aſcribe to nothing but the known Candor and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity

SERMON
Preached before the
Levant-Company.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM cvij. 23, 24.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <l>They that go down to the Sea in Ships, that do Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in great Waters;</l>
                  <l>Theſe ſee the Works of the Lord, and his Wonders
in the Deep.</l>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is the great Deſign of this Pſalm to
remind the ſeveral Orders and Degrees
of Men of their Obligations to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God; and to recollect to them all that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Gifts, of Encouragements, and of
Mercies, that they have receiv'd from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95972:4"/>
A Conſideration this, very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neceſſary in our corrupted Age, in
which the Affairs of this World are apt to
terminate even our higheſt Thoughts, and
teach us to forget God <hi>with whom we have to do.</hi>
Whereas there is nothing more certain than
that the beſt of us here below are nothing
but ſo many Agents, or rather Inſtruments
of Providence, directed and ordained by the
high hand of God, to act by his Commiſſion,
to make uſe of his Aſſiſtances, and to fulfil
his Purpoſes in our appointed ſtations. In
the mean time, the only true End we can
propoſe to our ſelves, is to attain, as near as
we are able, to the Good of our own Souls,
and the Glory of our Maker. And as the
meaneſt Peaſant upon Earth ought not to do
leſs than this; ſo the greateſt Monarch can
do no more. However, the different Poſts
and Stations, in which we are all to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
after this Common End, have given
different names and degrees to Vertue; and
according as our Talents are more or leſs,
ſo more or leſs Improvement is expected of
us. For ſome there are who can exerciſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95972:4"/>
little other Vertue in this Life, except that
of Patience and Submiſſion to the Yoke of
Providence; and who are for the moſt part
conſtrain'd to bring Glory to God by their
Sufferings only. Others again there are,
who are indeed called to an active ſtate of
Life, but that of ſo inferiour a Rank, and
ſo confin'd a Compaſs, that the benefit of
their Duty can hardly be deriv'd to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
themſelves. At the ſame time there is
a Nobler part of Mankind, ſet up as Lights
in the World, and ordained to be the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
of their Age and Country; Men adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Wiſdom, Ability and Renown; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing
the Gifts of Heaven to all that are
round about them. But however theſe may
be again diverſified in the ſeveral degrees,
and qualities, and circumſtances of Life;
there are none either more happy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or beneficial to their fellow-creatures,
than thoſe whom God is pleaſed to imploy
on more than one Scene of the Creation;
thoſe whom he leads, as it were by the Hand,
over the Paths of the Watry Deep, and
whom he takes as Witneſſes of his Power,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95972:5"/>
his Juſtice, his Mercy, and of his Immenſe
Goodneſs even to the unconverted World.
For whilſt others are confin'd at home to a
more narrow ſort of Obſervation, and have
no other Notices of an Univerſal Providence
but ſuch as are receiv'd by Report only; in
the mean time, <hi>They that go down to the Sea in
Ships, that do Buſineſs in great Waters, Theſe ſee
the Works of the Lord, and his Wonders in the
Deep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Diſcourſing on which words, the <hi>Scope</hi>
of the whole Pſalm, the <hi>Import</hi> of the Text
it ſelf, and that which is the <hi>Natural Inference</hi>
from both, direct me to do theſe Three
Things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. To prove that the Glory of God ought
to be the principal Aim of all our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings.</item>
               <item>II. To ſhow that the Glory of God may
more eſpecially be promoted by <hi>Travel,
and Foreign Commerce.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. To conſider what Duties are more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
incumbent upon thoſe whom
Providence has call'd to <hi>this important
Service.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95972:5"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Therefore I am to prove that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
Glory of God ought to be the principal Aim
of all our Undertakings.</p>
            <p>When I ſay of all our Undertakings, I
thereby directly exclude all that is indelibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
all that is idle and trivial, much more
all that is vitious in the Conduct of our Life.
For theſe are ſo many Scandals of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and blemiſhes to our Moral Prudence,
that either indeed they do not, or at leaſt we
could wiſh they did not, make up any part
of our real Character: But in every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous
and important Scene of our Human
Life, in this or that conſiderable Enterprize,
in this or that hinge of our main End, and
indeed every thing which we think produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of our true and chiefeſt Good, in this
we ought directly and formally to intend the
<hi>Almighty</hi>'s Glory: and that not only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Command of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.
31.) <hi>Whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God;</hi>
but likewiſe according to the Example of our
Bleſſed Saviour, who <hi>ſought not his own Glory,
(John</hi> 8. 50.) but in all his Deſires, his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95972:6"/>
his Endeavours ſtudied the ſole Glory
of him who ſent him: And though there is
no Name under Heaven, which in reſpect
of Gods Glory, can bear any degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
with our Lord and Saviour; yet
becauſe we all are parts of the Rational
World, endow'd with capacious Faculties,
and preſcrib'd a large variety of Duties,
therefore as far as we are capable of arriving
at any Perfection in theſe, ſo far are we ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of promoting our Makers Glory; <hi>i. e.</hi>
of anſwering thoſe remote Ends for which
God created the World in general, as well
thoſe immediate ones, for which he created
us in particular. In the mean time that it
ought to be our concern ſo to do, or at leaſt
ſo to intend, will appear from the Three fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Reaſons. And,</p>
            <p>1. The Glory of God ought to be the
principal Aim of all our Undertakings, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this is a certain Method to be conſtantly ſecure
of Succeſs.</hi> For thoſe Men alone can be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
in their Undertaking who terminate
their hopes in Temporal Riches or in World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Honour; whereas he who firſt enters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95972:6"/>
any laudable Profeſſion, and then dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
his Services therein to the Glory of
Almighty God, that Perſon has done all,
which in this uncertain Life, he was capable
of doing. Whether or no he ſhall execute
his Deſigns, lyes hid in the Counſel and
good Pleaſure of him that made him; but
that he intended well was the free and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
Choice of his own Will. After
which, though he be oppreſs'd by Envy,
though he be frown'd upon by Fortune, nay,
though he be intercepted by Mortality it
ſelf, yet he has taken an effectual Method
to enſure the Succeſs of his Deſigns: He
has approv'd his Reſolutions in the Sight of
an All ſeeing God, he ſhall at length be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into his <hi>Maſter's joy,</hi> and accepted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Character of <hi>a good and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 21.</note>
But,</p>
            <p>2. The Glory of God ought to be the
principal Aim of all our Undertakings, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the happyeſt Succeſs we can promiſe to our
ſelves is not due to us, but to God alone.</hi> We are
all the Servants and Vaſſals of our Heavenly
Lord and Maſter, Commiſſion'd in our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95972:7"/>
Earthly Pilgrimage to trade with that Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
which he has entruſted to us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is but Reaſonable that the Gain and
the Credit of our Service ſhould finally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue
to the great Proprietor. We our ſelves
are the Workmanſhip of his Hands; our
Being he renews to us every moment of our
Life; he is pleaſed to concur with us in
every Action that we undertake; we live
freely upon his Earth, and are dayly fed by
the Bounty of his Hands; we act by thoſe
Faculties which he has lent to us; and we
make uſe of ſuch Materials as are ſupplyed
by his Providence; and if after all this, we
can attribute any Honour to our ſelves, or
can take Pleaſure in our Productions, as if
they were the Works of our own Hands,
what do we elſe do, but idolize the Creature,
and adore Duſt and Aſhes for thoſe Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which we borrow'd from above? An
eminent Preſumption this, to rob God of
that Glory of which he is known to be ſo
Jealous, and of which he has peremptorily
declar'd, <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 42. 8.) <hi>That he will not give it
to another.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:95972:7"/>
3. The Glory of God ought to be the
principal Aim of all our Undertakings, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Glory of God is no other than our own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</hi>
For though the Glory of God, and
the Happineſs of Mankind are often repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to us under diſtinct Characters, yet
if duly apprehended they cannot but appear
to be one and the ſame thing. Whatſoever
is the ultimate End of our beſt and honeſteſt
Endeavours, that at the ſame time is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to make Man happy, and to glorifie
his Maker. As it is the end of our Labours,
and is agreeable to our Human Nature, ſo
it is the Creatures Good; but as it is the
Reward of our Vertue, and is agreeable to
the Divine Will, ſo it is the Creator's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And upon this account it is, that God
who created Man on purpoſe to make him
happy, ſays likewiſe by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that he <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him for his own Glory.</hi> But if this
indeed be the Caſe, we need not then be
directed to aim at the <hi>Glory of God</hi> in all
our Undertakings: for as we are Men, and
Maſters of right Reaſon, we ſhall be ſure
ſo to do. It remains only, that as we are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95972:8"/>
Chriſtians we propoſe it to our ſelves under
that Notion, and that we terminate our
Hopes in this or that ultimate Reward, not
for our own ſake, but for the ſake of our
Creator. This, if we could once practice
it, would prove an excellent Rule for the
Conduct of our whole Life. This would
be ſuch a bleſſed ſubordination of our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nature to the Heroick Spirit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
that we according to the Dictates
of right Reaſon, ſhould in all things be made
happy; and God according to the Dictates
of Religion in all things ſhould be <hi>glorified.</hi>
(1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11.) But having thus far inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Firſt General Head, and prov'd
that the Glory of God ought to be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Aim of all our Undertakings; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
now,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To ſhow that the Glory of God
may more eſpecially be promoted by <hi>Travel
and Foreign Commerce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It having been already aſſerted, that the
Glory of God is not really to be diſtinguiſh'd
from the Good of the Creature, it will here
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95972:8"/>
follow that thoſe may be chiefly Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
in promoting the Glory of their Maker,
who either by Nature, by Fortune, or
Education, are fitted to be beneficial to
their Fellow-Creatures. For the further
illuſtration of which; We are to know that
God is a bountiful and indulgent Parent
to the Univerſe. He no ſooner had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the World by his Power, but he plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
endow'd it by his Goodneſs. He
has provided not only for the Neceſſities,
but alſo for the Pleaſures and Perfections
of Life. He has furniſh'd us with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible
variety of Materials for the
Goods of the Mind, the Goods of the
Body, and the Goods of Fortune; for
Riches, for Pleaſure, for Vertue, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the like. In the mean time,
there needs only ſome large and exalted
Spirits to be the Diſpenſers of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties
Bounty: Men who are worthy
to diſplay, to propagate, and to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
the Gifts of Heaven: Men who
by long Habits of Induſtry and Reſolution,
have made it their familiar Province, to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95972:9"/>
improve themſelves, and enrich the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
But that theſe happy Opportunities
of being ſerviceable to the Glory of God,
are in a great meaſure peculiar to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of Travelling and Traffiquing
with Foreign Nations, is what I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to prove from no other than thoſe
Three Particulars, which are plainly hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in my Text; namely, 1. Becauſe it
advances our Native Country. 2. Becauſe
it acquaints us with the Works of the
Creation. 3. Becauſe it acquaints us
with the Diſpenſations of Providence.
Therefore,</p>
            <p>1. Travel and Foreign Commerce may
be ſerviceable to the Glory of God as
they are a Means of advancing our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country.</p>
            <p>When at firſt Providence diſtributed its
Goodneſs to the ſeveral Inhabitants of the
Earth, to theſe it gave Fruits, to thoſe
Metals, and to others Precious Stones:
but on its Favourite and beloved People,
<hi>It</hi> beſtow'd a Spirit and a Genius to uſe
theſe Treaſures of the Creation. Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95972:9"/>
not ſprung up amongſt them, leſt
they ſhould adminiſter to their Ignorance
and Idleneſs; but rather ſhown them at
a diſtance, the better to incourage and to
provoke their Induſtry. Theſe Men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
receive Vigour and Activity from their
own, but Food and Raiment from other
Climates. At Home they make Laws and
erect a Polity; but Abroad they ranſack
both the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and the <hi>Weſt</hi> for Riches. Valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Bleſſings <hi>theſe;</hi> if we imploy'd them
to the Credit of Religion, and in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of him, who firſt planted this Wealth
in other Countries, and then ſhow'd us
the way to bring it hither. But whatever
be the Ends to which they are at Home
converted, 'tis the Traveller and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
to whom we are beholden for thoſe
good things of the Earth, which others
make the matter either of their Vice or
Vertue. Theſe are they who bring us in the
Fruits, the Treaſures, and when they too
are laudable, even the Cuſtoms of our
Neighbours. Theſe are they who have rais'd
not only whole Trading Nations, but even
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95972:10"/>
leſſer <hi>Marts</hi> and Cities of Traffick, to be
the Wonder of the World. Inſomuch
that either in Sacred or Profane Hiſtory,
no Place of old was ever mention'd with
a Veneration equal to that of <hi>Tyre: Tyre,</hi>
ſays the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 23. 8.</note> 
               <hi>the crowning City,
whoſe Merchants are Princes, whoſe Traffickers
the Honourable of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Travel and Foreign Commerce are
ſerviceable to the Glory of God, as far
as they are the Means of acquainting us
with the Works of the Creation.</p>
            <p>When the Sea was as yet lock'd up from
the Uſe and Obſervation of Mankind, they
were then ſtrangely unacquainted with the
parts of the Creation; and the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of that Sphere wherein they convers'd,
detain'd them from any large and exalted
Speculations. But when the Experience
of Navigation had open'd another Scene,
and the new World of Waters was added
to that other of the Earth, then the
boundleſs Curioſity of Man was overcome
with a variety of Wonders. With Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and Amazement he travell'd over the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95972:10"/>
trackleſs Ocean: and the immeaſurable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Main led him by degrees to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Infinity of Him, <hi>whoſe way is in
the Sea, and his path in the great Water.</hi> To
ſay nothing of thoſe other ſurprizing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that adorn the proſpect of the Deep:
<hi>thoſe</hi> raging Waves, <hi>thoſe</hi> impending Rocks,
<hi>that</hi> herd of monſtrous Animals. Add to
this, <hi>thoſe</hi> various Conſtellations, <hi>that</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
appearance of the Planets, <hi>that</hi> new
viciſſitude of Days and Seaſons, together
with <hi>the</hi> innumerable unknown Productions
of diſtant Countries. All which when
we reflect upon, we ſhall think that the
Pſalmiſt had reaſon to cry thus Pathetically
towards the Throne of Grace; <hi>Lord, how
manifold are thy Works! in Wiſdom haſt thou
made them all: the Earth is full of thy Riches.
So is this great and wide Sea, wherein are things
creeping innumerable, both ſmall and great Beaſts.
There go the Ships; there is that Leviathan,
whom thou haſt made to play therein. (Pſal.</hi> 104.
24, 25, 26.) For theſe are all matter of
Aſtoniſhment, even while they continue
under the ken of Reaſon only: but being
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95972:11"/>
once ſubject to the naked Eye, and become
the viſible Objects of our outward Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
they then directly lead us to the
Contemplation of Things above, and fix
our Thoughts on him, who is the Author
and Diſpoſer of them all. So that view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Univerſal Cauſe in this multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Effects, and taking ſome Eſtimate
of God from the Grandeur of his Works,
we may preſume with holy <hi>Job</hi> to make
that familiar Exclamation; <hi>I have heard of
thee by the hearing of the Ear; but now mine Eye
ſeeth thee. (Job</hi> 42. 5.) But,</p>
            <p>3. Travel and Foreign Commerce are
ſerviceable to the Glory of God, as they
are a Means of acquainting us with the
Diſpenſations of Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To illuſtrate which Propoſition, I need
only cite that part of this exalted Pſalm
which follows the Verſes of my Text:</hi>
They that go down to the Sea in Ships, that do
Buſineſs in great Waters; Theſe ſee the Works
of the Lord, and his Wonders in the Deep. For
he commandeth and raiſeth the ſtormy Wind, which
lifteth up the Waves thereof. They mount up to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95972:11"/>
the Heaven, they go down again to the depths;
their Soul is melted becauſe of trouble. They reel
to and fro, and ſtagger like a drunken Man, and
are at their wits end. Then they cry unto the
Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out
of their diſtreſſes. He maketh the ſtorm a calm,
ſo that the waves thereof are ſtill. Then are they
glad becauſe they be quiet; ſo he bringeth them to
their deſired Haven.</p>
            <p>Lo, here a large deſcription of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
Goodneſs! Lo, here a mixture of
Judgment and Mercy, that will admit of
no Comment or farther Illuſtration. It is
ſo lively, and ſo Poetical a paſſage; it ſo
repreſents that Scene of Danger to all who
have had the leaſt Experience of Maritime
Affairs; it ſo recollects to them the whole
variety of their Fortune; it ſo urges them
to remember, how in the midſt of theſe
Fears and Uncertainties they have yet ſail'd
ſecurely over that dangerous and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Element. But if we take a view of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
as well as of Perſonal Providence;
It cannot but be entertaining to all thoſe
who have been call'd into Foreign Parts,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95972:12"/>
to obſerve the dealings of Almighty God
with thoſe places which heretofore were
the Seat of his true Religion. To ſee that
unworthy Land of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> unworthy
aforetime of the Prophets, the Meſſiah,
and the Apoſtles, now deſervedly become
a Shame, and a Deſart, and the Portion of
an ignorant and unbelieving People. In
the mean time, <hi>we</hi> who were then a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
overſpread with Error and thick Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
do now enjoy the pureſt Light and
Profeſſion of the Goſpel. Nay, it has
been the Fate of <hi>this very Kingdom</hi> to have
got to it ſelf not only the Religion, but
alſo the Trade of thoſe Eaſtern Countries.
And as the greedy<note n="*" place="margin">Vid.</note> 
               <hi>Tyrians</hi> of old traffickt
to theſe Iſles for <hi>Tin</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bochar.</note> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
us as their peculiar Mart,<note place="margin">Geogr.</note> unknown
as yet to other Nations of the Earth;<note place="margin">Sac.</note> ſo
we who were then impoveriſh'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
by them,<note place="margin">lib. 1.</note> do <hi>now</hi> by an happy turn
of Providence,<note place="margin">cap. 39.</note> fetch in our Stores and
our Riches from <hi>the Land of Tyre and Sidon.</hi>
Wonderful things are theſe, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to thoſe other, of which it was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95972:12"/>
once ſaid in a ſtrain of Propheſie, <hi>Who
ſhall live when God doth this? (Numb.</hi> 24. 23.)
But having inſiſted thus far upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
General Head, and ſhown that the
Glory of God may more eſpecially be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
by <hi>Travel and Foreign Commerce;</hi> I
proceed now,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To conſider what Duties are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
more immediately incumbent upon thoſe
whom Providence has call'd to <hi>that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If what has hitherto been urg'd can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
any conſiderate and thoughtful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
1. That the Glory of God ought
principally to be endeavour'd after; and
then, 2. That it may thus happily be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by Travel and Foreign Commerce;
it will here naturally follow that thoſe,
whoſe Lot is fall'n in this ſo Honourable
a Service, are lyable to many great and
ſignal Obligations: Which that they may
the better be exemplified, with an eye to
the ſeveral parts of the foregoing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
I ſhall endeavour briefly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95972:13"/>
them under theſe Three General
Heads. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Duty of Praiſe to
God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Duty of Example to
our Neighbour. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Duty of
Conſideration with our ſelves. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thoſe who are imploy'd in Travel
and Foreign Commerce are oblig'd to the
Duty of praiſing God.</p>
            <p>It is a confeſt Principle, and that too
even in Natural Religion, That as far as
we are poſſeſs'd of the good things of this
Life, ſo far we are Debtors to the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Hand of God. Which as it is true
of all, ſo moſt remarkably of that Order
of Men, to which we are now addreſſing.
For there is a wide and palpable difference
betwixt the Profeſſion of the <hi>Husbandman
and the Merchant.</hi> The one is inrich'd by
the ordinary Womb of Nature; but the
other by the immediate Care of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
The one grows fat in his own
Land, but the other in a Land that is not
his: The one is wont to reap in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to what he ſows, but the other is often
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95972:13"/>
bleſt with a much more abundant unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Affluence. From all which Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
the true and genuine Inference muſt
needs be this; <hi>viz.</hi> That if the Benefits
which <hi>thoſe</hi> enjoy are ſeven times due to
God, then <hi>theſe</hi> are indebted to him ſeventy
times ſeven. But be it more or leſs which
Heaven has intruſted to us; As a <hi>Jew</hi> or
an <hi>Heathen</hi> would repay theſe with the
Firſt-Fruits of his Temporal Increaſe; ſo
a true Chriſtian will prepare his devout
Acknowledgments <hi>in better Sacrifices than
thoſe.</hi> He will thank his Almighty Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
not in an air of Boaſting, but in
devout and mental Adorations: Not in the
Market-place, but in the inmoſt privacy
of the Cloſet: Not for that he has made
him Rich, but that of his Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
he has granted him enough. After
which, he will be careful to imploy the
Overplus, to the Honour of Religion, in
the Education of his Family, or for the
Benefit of his Native Country. <hi>And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi>
this is the moſt likely progreſs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the ſeveral degrees of an Hearty and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95972:14"/>
Religious Praiſe. For a truly generous
Mind is ſenſible of all its real Obligations;
a ſenſe of our Obligations will remit us
to the thoughts of Providence; the
thoughts of Providence will commemorate
Gods Mercies; the memory of Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
will beget a Chriſtian Gratitude; and
that Gratitude will break forth into the
Ejaculation of the Bleſſed Pſalmiſt; <hi>Oh
that Men would therefore praiſe the Lord for his
Goodneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 31.</note> 
               <hi>and for his wonderful Works to the
Children of Men.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe who are imploy'd in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
and Foreign Commerce, are oblig'd to
the Duty of good Example to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>As the Example of each ſingle Perſon is
always to be meaſur'd by the Character
which he bears; ſo in ſome ſence it is true,
that none bear a greater Character than
thoſe, whom Providence has ordain'd to
any Foreign Imployment. For the Charge
which they carry with them is, in truth, a
ſacred and ineſtimable Charge: no leſs
than the Credit of their Religion and their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95972:14"/>
Native Country. They ought to approve
themſelves Abroad not only as Perſons of
ſober and honeſt Converſation; but what
is much more, as becomes true Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and ſincere Chriſtians. So that if by
means of thoſe who ſhall travel from hence
into the Unbelieving World, <hi>this Nation is</hi>
not eſteem'd as a Brave, a Generous and
Heroick People; <hi>this Faith as</hi> an Holy,
Sincere and Heavenly Profeſſion; the fault
will lye at their doors, whoſe Life and
whoſe Behaviour have miſrepreſented ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But as theſe are the Circumſtances
of our Country-men Abroad; ſo being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
Home, the Caſe is not much alter'd.
For <hi>theſe</hi> are the Men who committed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their Fortune to Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Protection; <hi>theſe</hi> are the Men who
have proſper'd in that ſtate of Life; <hi>theſe</hi>
are the Men who have <hi>ſeen the Works of the
Lord, and his Wonders in the Deep;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>theſe</hi> too are the Men who ſtand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to a more exact performance of their
Duty. Otherwiſe there never will be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch weak and unwary Perſons, who
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95972:15"/>
being leſs acquainted with the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Providence, will be led by <hi>theſe
great Authorities</hi> into the like remiſneſs of
Obedience. And then they, by whoſe
<hi>Example</hi> our moſt holy Religion is thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
diſhonour'd, will appear at the
great Tribunal, not only guilty of their
own, but likewiſe <hi>as partakers of other Mens
Sins.</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22.) But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Thoſe who are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in Travel and Foreign Commerce,
are oblig'd to the Duty of Conſideration
with themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Art of <hi>knowing ones ſelf is</hi> what ſome
Heathens have much talk'd of, but what
ſome Chriſtians have better practic'd. And
in truth it is ſo deſirable a Perfection, that it is
much to be wiſh'd that the ſeveral ſtations
and degrees of Men were acquainted with
it: Eſpecially the <hi>Merchant and the Traveller,</hi>
in whoſe Life there muſt needs be ſo great
a variety of Accidents, ſo many remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Events, and ſuch a mixture of Joy
and Wonder, as will be always entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to themſelves. To this end it would
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95972:15"/>
prove a Method of excellent good Service,
if each ſingle Perſon preſerv'd a faithful
<hi>Regiſter</hi> of all his Actions, and as it were
an <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of his own Life. There it
might be pleaſant, as well as uſeful to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
what diverſity of Men, of Things,
or of Places, they have ſeen; what Works
of Gods Power, or what Diſpenſations of
his Providence; what Dangers they have
eſcap'd; what Difficulties they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter'd
by Sea or Land; with how little,
or with how much, they at firſt began;
and finally, with what increaſe of Fortune
God has bleſs'd their induſtry. After
which it will be neceſſary to deal ſincerely
with themſelves, and to put to an Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Conſcience theſe or the like Queſtions.
<hi>Have</hi> they been deſirous to praiſe and to
adore God for his manifold and repeated
Mercies? <hi>Have</hi> they been fair and juſt in
all their Dealings? <hi>Have</hi> they improv'd
the Talent of Grace, as well as that of
Fortune? <hi>Have</hi> they been Charitable to
the Diſtreſſed according to their Ability?
<hi>Have</hi> they been ſtudious to do Honour to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95972:16"/>
the Country from whence they came, but
chiefly to that unblemiſh'd Religion which
they profeſs? <hi>In general, Have</hi> they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
themſelves as wiſe and faithful
<hi>Stewards</hi> to their great Maſter, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
the good Things of this Life to the
<hi>Glory</hi> of him who lent them? <hi>Theſe</hi> are
thoſe only pious Conſiderations which ſhall
compleat the admir'd Perſon, who is in
Favour both with God and Man: <hi>Theſe</hi>
are they which ſhall make him happy in
<hi>himſelf,</hi> and happy to his Fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
<hi>Theſe</hi> are they which ſhall lead
him from Honour to Honour, and from
Vertue to Vertue; till by ſeveral grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Prudence, his Character ſhall at
length come up to that <hi>Idea,</hi> and that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of the Wiſe <hi>Solomon; Happy is the Man
that findeth Wiſdom, and the Man that getteth
Underſtanding: For the Merchandiſe of it is
better than the Merchandiſe of Silver, and the
Gain thereof than fine Gold.</hi> (Prov. 3. 13,
14.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:95972:16"/>
Now the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who
accepteth the Doers of the Word and not Hearers
only, bleſs, confirm, preſerve, ſtrengthen us, and
eſtabliſh us in every good Word and Work!</p>
            <p>The Peace of God which paſſeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
