            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THou ſeeſt that in this Epiſtle, which for the moſt part of it was written above two years ago, I have ſpoken a word of <hi>Stage-playes, prophane Interludes, Comedies,</hi> &amp;c. at that time, and ſeveral years before, much in uſe amongſt us; whereto I would now add a few words more, and deduce a little their infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, idolatrous, deviliſh, and damnable Pedigree and Original, and give thee a brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the judgement of the ancient Chriſtian Church about them; that the Actors in them, with the Patrons and haunters of them, may with the greater diſſatisfaction reflect on there own by-paſt unſuitable and diſconform practiſe, and that all others may for ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after learn to fear, and to do no more ſo unchriſtianly: To which I am the rather induced, that the worthy Author of this Treatiſe, hath onely in paſſing made mention of them as a breach of the ſeventh Command, they being then utterly in deſuetude with us, and it having not ſo much as once entered into his thoughts, that after ſo bright and glorious a Sun-ſhine of Goſpel-light, the Generation would ever, let be ſo quickly, have ſo far degenerated, as to ſuffer themſelves to be tempted to have any fellowſhip with ſuch unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: I ſay then, that <hi>Stage-playes,</hi> in their ſeveral ſorts, were prohibited, reprobated, and condemned, and the Actors in them appointed to be excommunicated by the Canons of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral more particular, and of ſome general Councels (which Canons I forbear for brevities ſake, to ſet down at length) as namely, by the fifth Canon of the firſt Councel at <hi>Arles</hi> in <hi>France, Anno</hi> 314. in the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great; by the twentieth Canon of the ſecond Councel held there, <hi>Anno</hi> 326. or more probable 389. as <hi>Fr. Longus a Coriolano</hi> reckoneth in his ſum of all the Councels; by the fifty ſeventh, ſixty ſecond, and ſixty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Canons of the <hi>Eliberine</hi> Councel in <hi>Spain, Anno</hi> 305. by the eleventh and thirty fifth Canons of the third (to wit, from <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time as <hi>Spondanus</hi> reckoneth) Councel of <hi>Carthage, Anno</hi> 397. the very ſame with the thirteenth and thirty fifth Canons of the Councel of <hi>Hippo</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> held <hi>Anno</hi> 393. as <hi>Longus a Coriolano</hi> ſheweth; who ſets down the ſum of the Canons framed at <hi>Hippo</hi> at the cloſe of the Canons made in this third Councel of <hi>Carthage;</hi> by the twelfth Canon of the <hi>African</hi> Councel held <hi>Anno</hi> 408. where <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was preſent; the Canons of both which Councels ſuppoſe perſons to have been excommunicated on this account, and provide for their reconciliation to the Church, in caſe of repentance and turning from theſe practiſes to the Lord; and by the fifty firſt and ſixty ſecond Canons of the ſixth general Councel (called by ſome the fifth) held at <hi>Conſtantinople, Anno</hi> 680. the Canons whereof were renewed in that Councel held at <hi>Conſtantinople, Anno</hi> 692. which is called <hi>Quimſextum;</hi> theſe two Canons are very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and peremptory in this thing. And can any Chriſtians warrantably, and without ſin, recreate themſelves with beholding ſuch playes, the Actors wherein deſerve to be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated? what? is there no better, no more innocent and inoffenſive way? or is this the onely or the beſt way to recreate men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to refine, ſharpen, and poliſh their wits; to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and prevail with them to hate and flee vice, and to love and follow vertue; to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them from Hiſtory with, to impreſs on them the remembrance and to excite them to the imitation of, the noble and truely imitable actions of illuſtrious Heroes, and other great men; to breed them to a ſuitable confidence; to make them eloquent and fine ſpokes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and to help them to a becoming geſt in all actions, places, and ſocieties? the grave Seers, and great Lights of the Church, did never ſee any ſuch thing in them; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb facs="tcp:31633:12"/>
have with common ſuffrage judged them to be the moſt effectual and compendious way to make men ſoft, diſſolute, and ſenſual; nay, even in a manner quite to emaſculate, if not to brutifie them; and have without any diſcord declared, that the lightneſs, laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and leudneſs that in theſe playes were touched under, and covered over with ſuch shreds and pieces of Learning, Hiſtory, Eloquence, Invention, Wit, and Art, were thereby onely made the more dangerous; and that Satan shewed his pernicious and peſtilent policy not a little in thus tincturing, ſugaring, and guilding theſe poyſonable Pills, that they might go the better down, diffuſe themſelves the leſs ſenſibly, and operate the more ſtrongly. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome empty and effeminate, vain and vicious, Roman Emperours reduced ſuch Playes, yet ſome of the graveſt and ſobereſt, manlieſt and braveſt, even Heathen Emperours, did oppoſe and exterminate them (ſo that <hi>Guevara</hi> noteth it to have been one of the tokens and characteriſticks to know a vertuous or vicious Prince of <hi>Rome</hi> by, to wit, whether he maintained Players, Jeſters, and J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As they have been thus forbidden &amp; cenſured by <hi>Councels,</hi> ſo I ſay more particularly they have been very unanimouſly condemned by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> on theſe and other ſuch like grounds; 1. As being a breach of the ſeventh Commandment, wherein a multitude of modern Divines writing on this Command, accord with them. 2. As being a conforming to, and participating with Pagans in their idolatrous and ſuperſtitious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, expreſly forbidden to the people of God in the Scripture; which put <hi>Cyprian deſpect.</hi> peremptorily to conclude, <hi>That the Scripture hath everlaſtingly condemned all ſorts of ſuch Spectacles and Stage-playes, when it took away Idolatry, the Mother of them, whence all theſe Monſters of vanity, lightneſs, and leudneſs did proceed.</hi> 3. As being croſs to, and a practical renunciation of, the baptiſmal Vow of Chriſtians, wherein they ingage to renounce the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and all his pomps and works, of which ſort they account the acting and beholding popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Stage-playes to be. 4. As being the removal of a diſtinguishing character of Chriſtians from Heathen Gentiles, <hi>Who</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſayes, <hi>lib. deſpect. cap.</hi> 24.) <hi>did moſt of all diſcern men by this, that they abandoned and renounced all Stage-playes.</hi> 5. As being unſuitable to, if not inconſiſtent with, the Goſpel, which forbiddeth Chriſtians to make proviſion for the fleſh to fulfill the luſts thereof, to be Caterers for their corruptions, and to be conform to the World; and commandeth them to walk circumſpectly, accurately, even with ſpiritual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs and ſtrictneſs, not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming the time; wofully waſted away, and miſerably miſpent this way; to abſtain from all appearance of evil; to rejoyce in the Lord; and when they are merry, to ſing Pſalms, and to vent and expreſs their mirth in Songs of praiſe to God, and not in this wanton way; and aſſureth them withal, that evil communications corrupt good manners. 6. As being a corruption of manners, incentives to lightneſs and luſt, and ſeminaties and nurſeries of wantonneſs and uncleanneſs.
And 7. as holding their pedigree, original, and inſtitution from the Devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Inventer of them: and being at firſt Idolatrouſly and ſuperſtitiouſly celebrated to the honour, and for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years together, dedicated, devoted, and appropriated to the worship and ſervice of the Heathen-Devil-Gods; <hi>Who</hi> (as <hi>Augustine</hi> affirmeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Civ.

In the Conſulſhip of <hi>C. Sulpitius Petieus,</hi> and <hi>C. Lucinius Stole, Anno ab urb. cond.</hi> 390. in the time of the great and raging peſtilence wherein <hi>Furius Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus,</hi> Dictator and Deliverer of <hi>Rome</hi> from the <hi>Gaules</hi> died; <hi>wherein for procuring the mercy of the Gods there was a lectiſterne, but when by no device of man, nor help of the Gods, the violence of the plague could be aſſwaged, their minds were ſo poſſeſt with ſuperſtition, that the Stage-playes were, as men ſay, firſt invented</hi> (that is belike, Playes in that pompous; ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous, effeminate, and luxurious mode on the Stage, which had never before been uſed in the City (for ſeveral Playes they had ere this time) <hi>a ſtrange device for a martial people, who before time</hi> (for moſt part at leaſt) <hi>accuſtomed to behold games of activity and ſtrength in the great lift called</hi> Circus; <hi>and from this ſmall beginning</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>in a ſecond and wholſome State, this folly grew to ſuch a height of madneſs, as is untolerable to the moſt opulent States and Empires; and yet theſe Playes ſo brought in, and ſet forth</hi> (called by <hi>Florus</hi> in his Breviary on that Book, <hi>new and ſtrange Religions) imployed about a religious buſineſs, did neither rid mens minds of ſcruple and ſuperſtition, nor eaſe their bodies:</hi>
Thus they are condemned as ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and an innovation of their old Religion, by theſe two famous Heathen Hiſtorians. The <hi>fourth</hi> may be that which is made mention of by <hi>Tit.

Manlius Occidinus, Ann. ab urb. cond.</hi> 575. <hi>Who declared that before he would meddle with his Office, he would diſcharge both himſelf and the City of duty towards the Gods, in paying the Vows that he had made on that ſame day, that he had his laſt battel with the</hi> Celtiberians, <hi>anent the celebrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Playes to the honour of the moſt mighty and gracious God</hi> Jupiter, <hi>and to build a Temple to</hi> Fortuna Aequeſtris; and accordingly levied a great Tax for that end, which behoved to be retrenched, becauſe of the exorbitancy of it. The <hi>fifth</hi> and laſt ſhall be that which is
<pb facs="tcp:31633:13"/>
touched by <hi>Pol. Virg. ubi prius pag.</hi> 377. concerning <hi>the Romans, their taking care for</hi> Apollo <hi>his Playes, which were firſt dedicated to him in the time of the ſecond punick War for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictory from him, to drive</hi> Hannibal <hi>out of</hi> Italy. To theſe may be added what <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſ. Annal. pag.</hi> 263. reports from <hi>Zozimus</hi> concerning <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, when he returned victorious over the <hi>Germans</hi> to <hi>Millan, That he quite neglected and contemned ſuch Playes, to the great grief of the Heathens, who alledged that theſe Playes were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the Gods for the cure of the peſtilence and other diſeaſes, and for averting of wars.</hi> From all which it is manifeſt, that the original of theſe Stage-playes and ſuch others, was from the Devil, and celebrated by the Heathens to the honour and worſhip of their Devil-Gods in way of religious Sacrifices to them, either as pacificatory or gratificatory; with whom in their Idolatries and ſuperſtitions, the Scriptures forbid all ſymbolizing and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Let us hear now in the next place ſome more of theſe Fathers ſpeak their own and the Churches thoughts, a little more particularly of Stage-playes, with reſpect to ſuch grounds, having heard ſome of them already: <hi>Clem. Alex. orat. adhort. adv. Gentes,</hi> calls <hi>Stage-playes, Comedies, and amorous Poems, teachers of Adultery, and defilers of mens ears with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications;</hi> and ſayes, <hi>That not onely the uſe, the ſight, the hearing, but the very memory of Stage-playes should be abolished:</hi> And elſe-where (for I do here purpoſely forbear very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular citations, becauſe ordinary Readers will not much, if at all, ſearch after them; and the Learned that have a mind to it, will eaſily find them out) tells Chriſtian youths, <hi>That their Paedagogues muſt not lead them to Playes or Theaters, that may not unfitly be called the chairs of Peſtilence, becauſe theſe Conventicles, where men and women meet together promiſcuouſly to behold one another, are the occaſion of leudneſs, and there they give or plot wicked counſel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cyprian de ſpect.</hi> ſtiles Theaters <hi>the ſtewes of publick Chaſtity, the maſtership of obſcenity, which teach theſe ſins in publick, that men may more uſually and eaſily commit them in private, he learneth to commit who accuſtometh himſelf to behold the theatrical repreſentations of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: It is not lawful for faithful Chriſtians, yea, it is altogether unlawful, to be preſent at theſe Playes:</hi> And elſewhere he ſaith, <hi>She that perchance came a chaſt Matron to the Playes, goes away a Strumpet from the Play-houſe:</hi> (We may here notice what the Satyrical Poet <hi>Juvenal</hi> ſayes to this purpoſe, <hi>Sat.</hi> 6. That a man in his time could not pick one chaſt woman, whom he might ſafely love as his wife out of the whole Play-houſe; and that all women, who frequent Stage-playes, are infamous, and forfeit their good names It were good that our women, who love and haunt ſuch Playes, would conſider this: as alſo what is reported of <hi>Sempronius Sophus,</hi> a noble Roman, who divorced from his Wife for this alone cauſe, that ſhe frequented Stage-playes without his knowledge, which might make her an Adultereſs; which Divorce the whole Roman Senate did approve (though it was the very firſt they did approve) as being a mean to keep women chaſte: So great an enemy to chaſtity were theſe Playes judged to be; which is touched by <hi>Rhodiginus,</hi> amongſt others, in his Antique Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>lib.</hi> 28. <hi>cap.</hi> 16.) <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls the <hi>Play-houſe, the Chappel of Venery, the Houſe of Letchery, the Conſiſtory of uncleanneſs:</hi> And in his <hi>Apol. adv. Gent. We renounce your Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles and Stage-playes, even as we reject their original, which we know to have had their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from Superſtition; we have nothing at all to do with the fury of your Circus, with the dishoneſty of the Theater, we come not at all to your Playes. Origen in Epiſt. ad Rom.</hi> ſayes, <hi>That Chriſtians muſt not lift up their eyes to Stage-playes, the pleaſurable delights of polluted eyes, leſt their luſts be inflamed by them. Lactantius de vero cultu,</hi> ſayes, <hi>That theſe Interludes with which men are delighted, and whereat they are willingly preſent, becauſe they are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt inſtigations to Vice, and the moſt powerful inſtrument to corrupt mens minds, are wholly to be abolished from amongſt us.
Greg. Naz. de rect. educ.</hi> calls <hi>Stage-players the Servants of lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Stage-playes, the dishoneſt, unſeemly inſtructions of laſcivious men, who repute nothing filthy but modeſty; and Play-houſes the Laſcivious chops of all filthineſs and impurity.</hi> Ambroſe in Pſal. 118. ſtiles <hi>Stage-playes ſpectacles of vanity, by which the Devil conveys incentives of pleaſure to mens hearts; Let us therefore</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>turn away our eyes from theſe vanities and
<pb facs="tcp:31633:13"/>
Stage-playes.</hi> Hierom. Epiſt. ad Salvinam, <hi>Have nothing to do with Stage-playes, becauſe they are the pleaſing incendiaries of mens luſts. Auguſtine de Civ. Dei,</hi> brands Stage-playes with this black mark, <hi>That they are the ſpectacles of filthineſs, the overturners of goodneſs and honeſty, the chaſers away of all modeſty and chaſtity; whorish shews, the art of miſchievous vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, which even modeſt Pagans did blush to behold, the inventions to lewdneſs, by which the Devil uſeth to gain innumerable companies of evil men to himſelf.</hi> In another place he calls <hi>Theaters, Cages of uncleanneſs, the publick profeſsions of wickedneſs; and Stage-playes, the moſt petulant, the moſt impure, impudent, wicked, shameful, and deteſtable attonements of filthy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil-gods; which to true religion are moſt abominable.</hi> And elſewhere he declares, <hi>That when the Goſpel came to be ſpread abroad in the World, Stage-playes and Play-houſes, the very caves of filthineſs, went to ruin almoſt in every City, as inconſiſtent with it; whence the Gentiles</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>complained of the times of Chriſtianity, as evil and unhappy times.</hi> Epiphanius contra haereſ. ſayes, <hi>That the Catholick and Apoſtolick Church doth reprobate and forbid all Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Stage-playes, and ſuch like Heathenish ſpectacles.</hi> Chryſoſtom. Hom. in Matth. ſayes, <hi>I wish the Theaters and Play-places were all thrown down, though as to us they did lye deſolate and ruined long ago:</hi> Elſewhere he ſayes, <hi>That nothing brings the Oracles and Ordinances of God into ſo great contempt, as admiring and beholding Stage-playes: And that neither Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments nor any other of Gods Ordinances</hi> (pray mark this diligently, O! how often is it ſadly verified?) <hi>will do a man good ſo long as he goes to Stage-playes.</hi> Bernard Serm. ad milites templi, ſayes, <hi>That all the faithful Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt abominate and reject all diceing and Stage-playes, as vanities and falſe frenzies.</hi> Let <hi>Salvian</hi> his weighty words, <hi>de gub. Dei,</hi> ſhut up this ſhort account of the judgement of theſe ancient Fathers anent this matter, who ſayes, <hi>That in Stage-playes there is a certain Apoſtacie from the Faith.—For what is the firſt confeſsion of Chriſtians in their Baptiſm, but that they do proteſt they renounce the Devil, his Pomps, Spectacles and Works; know thou Chriſtian, when thou doeſt wittingly and knowingly return to Stage-playes, thou returneſt to the Devil, who is in his Playes, for thou haſt renounced both of them together:</hi> wherein many Fathers agree with him, they being harmonious in condemning Stage-playes, as being ordinarily ſtuffed with the Names, Hiſtories, Perſons, Fables, Rites, Ceremonies, Villanies, Inceſts, Rapes, Applauſes, Oaths, Imprecations, and Invocations of the Idol-gods; as when the Actors cry, Help <hi>Jove, Juno, Apollo, Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> &amp;c. and exclaim, <hi>O Jove! O Cupid! O Venus! O Apollo! O Mars! O ye Gods!</hi> &amp;c. and ſwear by <hi>Jove, Mars, Venus, the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

(beſide all theſe, they are often fraughted in theſe dayes with wicked and prophane ſcoffs and jeſts, abuſes of Scripture, and bitter invectives againſt piety) and as drawing men on to Profanity; Idolatry, and Atheiſm. In fine, to shew the perfect agreement betwixt the Primitive and Proteſtant Church anent ſuch Playes, it will neither be impertinent, nor I hope unedifying, to ſubjoyn here the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the famous Reformed Proteſtant Church of <hi>France</hi> (from which other reformed Proteſtant Churches in this do not differ, yea, the ſtream of Proteſtant Divines runneth this way) declared in a National Synod held at <hi>Rochel, Anno</hi> 1571. where this Canon was unanimouſly framed; <hi>Congregations shall be admonished by their Miniſters ſeriouſly to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and ſuppreſs all Dances, Mummeries, and Interludes, and it shall not be lawful for any Chriſtians to act or to be preſent</hi> (mark well) <hi>at any Comedies, Tragedies, Playes, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes, or any other ſuch ſports, either in publick or in private Chambers, conſidering that they have alwayes been oppoſed, condemned, and ſuppreſſed, in and by the Church, as bringing along with them the corruption of good manners, eſpecially when as the holy Scripture is prophaned, which is not delivered to be acted or played, but onely to be preached.</hi>
What uſeth now to be ſaid in Apology for, and defence of Stage-playes, and for reforming of them, yet ſo as to retain them ſtill, was long ſince objected by the witty and voluptuous Pagans, and ſolidly anſwered, and ſtrongly confuted by the Fathers; as it hath been by ſeveral Modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, particularly Doctor <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stubbs,</hi> and notably by Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> (to whoſe indefatigable diligence in collecting, and great judgement in diſpoſing of many of the

            <p>THe Decay of Religion at this day in the World, is come to ſuch an height, as that it is obſerved by all who pretend unto any Concernment therein, and Complained of by Many. By Religion we underſtand the Power of it in the Hearts and Lives of Men, and not any Outward Profeſſion of it only; much leſſe the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pretence that is made unto it, in them by whom its power is openly denied. Neither is it manifeſt onely in the fruits of Sinfull ſecurity and the flagitious lives of all ſorts of men, but begins to be ſo alſo in its effects, in the preſent ſtate of things in the World filled with Miſery and Confuſion: <hi>For the Wrath of God</hi> is many wayes <hi>revealed from Heaven againſt the ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men, who hold the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>th in unrighteouſneſs:</hi> and in many Nations the Viſible tokens and demonſtrations of it do abound. <hi>For, there is in them no peace; to them that go out, nor to them that come in; but great vexation is upon all their Inhabitants. Nation is deſtroyed of Nation, and City of City; for God doth vex them with all adverſity.</hi> For whatever may be the thoughts and counſells of men in theſe things, the Judgements of God are not meerly ſubſervient unto their luſts and paſſions; it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his own controverſie with the world for neglect of the Goſpell and oppoſition unto it that he pleadeth in them, neither can our preſent reſpite in the enjoyment of outward mercies be any evidence unto us, that we are not the objects of the ſame diſpleaſure. All men are in the ſame condition among whom the ſame ſins and the ſame relapſes from the power of religion are ſound; for God is no Reſpecter of perſons, It is indeed an effect of divine patience, which if abuſed unto ſecurity, will iſſue in a more ſore revenge. In the mean time the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>oice of God unto us in all the miſeries and deſolations we hear of in the world, is, that unleſs we Repent, we shall all likewiſe perish. Neither are we altogether left without pregnant warnings among our ſelves in many ſevere diſpenſations of divine providence. And thoſe who are not utterly hardened through the deceitfulneſſe of Sin, may eaſily ſee the hand of God lifted up in various intimations of his diſpleaſure. But hitherto it muſt be acknowledged, and ought to be bewailed, that the Security of the world ſeems to be unshaken, and the inundation of Sin not to be ſtemmed in the leaſt meaſure.</p>
            <p>What are the reaſons and cauſes of the preſent general defection, from the Truth, Power, Holineſſe and Glory of the Goſpel or Chriſtian Religion, I have enquired into and declared in a peculiar Treatiſe deſigned unto that end. Some few things ſuited unto the preſent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be here obſerved. All decays in Religion begin in individuall perſons, though it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ſelf unto families, and ſo the infection ſpreads unto greater ſocieties, Ecleſiaſticall and National. For ſuch alſo is the order in the genuine progreſſe of the power of Religion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it is oppoſed. The teſtimony that God gave unto <hi>Abraham</hi> was, that keeping the way of the Lord himſelf, he taught and commanded his Children and houſehold after him ſo to do. And if the living power of Godlineſſe expreſſed in the Hiſtory of Chriſt, and the Goſpel in an holy Conuerſation, be not preſerved in Individual Perſons; the Profeſſion of the pureſt Religion in Churches, or the higheſt Pretence unto it in Publick, National Acts are neither uſeful to the Souls of men, nor do any way tend unto the Glory of God. And the ſole uſe of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Religious Order and Profeſſion is loſt, where they are not applyed unto the Ingenerating and promoting of Holyneſs, or Evangelical Obedience in particular Perſons. Wherefore if any Revival of the Power of Religion in the World may be yet hoped for; if any ſtop may be put unto the Fatal Declenſion, which it ſuffers under, the forming and reſtoring of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of it in the Hearts and Conſciences of ſuch Perſons is the way whereby it muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e attempted; from and by them muſt it be diffuſed into Families, and greater Socities: Here muſt all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation begin, or in the uſe of means ſuited thereunto. How this may be effected, we have one inſtance among many, propoſed unto us in the enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The General and undoubted Reaſon of all ſins and miſcarriages amongſt men, is the neglect
<pb facs="tcp:31633:15"/>
of the Holy and Perfect Rule of Obedience, or of the Law of God, without a recourſe unto a Diligent Conſcientious Attendance thereunto, without a due Senſe of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Authority of God therein; and of the Account which they muſt shortly give of their regard unto it; there can be no juſt Expectation of the Re-introduction of the Power and Glory of Religion. And many wayes there are, whereby men are diverted from the due Conſideration of, and holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e with this Rule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Falſe and Corrupt Interpretations of the Law, do countenance many in Various Luſts; and the neglect of Mani old Duties. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> of Old repreſenting the Deſign and Senſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> as regarding Outward Acts and Practices only, laid an Axe to the Roo: of all True H lineſs and Religion in the Apoſiatizing Church of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> Under a Pretence of Eſtablishing a falſe Legal Righteouſneſs, they deſtroyed the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Righteouſneſs of the Law. And theſe things go together alwayes. Thoſe who plead for a Righteouſneſs of their own, as it were by the Works of the Law, do conſtantly by Falſe Gloſſes and Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations deſtroy the Spirituality, and all Animating Principles of the Law it ſelf. For, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to underſtand the Senſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> and to ſeek for Righteouſneſs by it, or as it were by i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Works, are altogether Inconſiſtent: whereas therefore, many men, partly by their Natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Blindneſs, are not able to diſcerne the Spiritual Senſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> and partly out of their Diſlike of, and Enmity unto it, will not comply with the Light which is tender<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d unto them, they have ſought by Falſe interpretations to Accommodase the <hi>Law</hi> it ſelf unto their own Luſt and inclination. So evidently was it with the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of Old. Nor are the Preſent Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of many about thoſe things much different from theirs. For ſuch Expoſitions of the <hi>Law</hi> are embraced, wherein there is little Reſpect unto the Spiritual frame of the Heart, or the Internal Actings of the Adverſe Principles of Sin and Obedience: The Extent of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is alſo by many exceedingly ſtrained, nor will any thing ſcarcely be allowed to be Commanded or Forbidden in it, but what the Letter doth plainly expreſs. And it is evident how ſuch Apprehenſion, will inſenſibly weaken the Senſe of a Neceſſity of Univerſal Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and abate the Diligence of the mind in endeavouring after a renewed Spiritual Frame of Heart; by ſuch means a Declenſion from all true Holineſs and Piety will be effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted. For, when men once begine to ſatisfie themſelves in the outward Duties of Divine Worship and Righteouſneſs, which if alone, are but a dead Carcaſs of Religion, they will not long abide in a Conſcientious Obſervation even of them.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> The ſeparation of the Duties of the Law from the Grace of the Goſpel, will have the like effect. For this will quickly iſſue in a pretence of Morality, ſet up its oppoſition unto true evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obedience. And there is no way whereby the whole Rule of Duty can be rendred more ineffectual and uſeleſs unto the ſouls of men. For take away that Reconciliation which is made in Chriſt between the Law and the Goſpel, and it will prove a killing Letter only. And ſo far as this imagination is gone about it quickly manifeſts it ſelf in its Fruits. For every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of men againſt the Grace of God will iſſue in the ruine of morality among themſelves.</p>
            <p>Such Apprehenſions as theſe in a coincidence with abounding tentations ſuited unto the Luſts of all ſorts of men, cannot but promote the Intereſt and prevalency of Sin and Antichriſt in the World. However manifeſt it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that that is a great neglect and contempt of the holy Rule of obedience in the moſt, with great ignorance and miſunderſtanding of the deſigne and ſenſe of it in many. Wherefore an upright endeavour to Declare and Vindicate the Authority and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, as alſo to make Application of it unto the Conſciences of profeſſed Chriſtians, to direct them in, and preſs them unto the conſtant performance of obedience, cannot but be eſteemed ſeaſonable, and through the bleſſing of God may be ſingularly uſeful. So our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf obſerving the miſchief that had befaln the Church by the falſe expoſition of the Law, obtruded on the people by the Phariſees, began his Prophetical Miniſtry in the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it from their corrupting gloſſes, reſtoring its priſtine Crown of purity and ſpirituality, as the Jews have yet a Tradition, that it shall be ſo in the dayes of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> And on the ſame conſideration it cannot be denied, but that the Endeavour of this worthy ſervant of Chriſt in the work of the Goſpel, the Authour of the enſuing Expoſition of the Decalogue, is both ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and worthy of Acceptation. For as other endeavours alſo are required in all them on
<pb facs="tcp:31633:15"/>
whom it is incumbent, to take care in their reſpective ſtations for the improvement of Holineſs in the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the obſtruction of the progre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, what in them lyeth; ſo for the reaſons before-mentioned, that in this particular way is peculiarly ſeaſonable and uſeful. And I am perſwaded, that every pious, humble and unprejudiced Reader, will judge that much benefit may be obtained by his performance. Some may eaſily ſee how short that meaſure of Duties which they have preſcribed unto themſelves doth come, of what is indiſpencibly required of them; and others may take a plain proſpect of that whole Scheme of Obedience in principles, matter, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and end which they ſincerely endeavour to come up unto. And ſundry things there are which appear to me with a notable degree of Excellency in the whole diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Plainneſs and perſpicuity in teaching, ſeems to have been deſigned by the Authour throughout the whole book. Hereby it is accommodated unto the meanest Capacities, which is the greateſt excellency of Diſcourſes of this nature as unto outward Forme and Order. For, whereas its only end is to direct the Practiſe of all ſorts of Chriſtians, all Ornaments of Speech, every thing that diverts from plainneſs, ſobriety, and gravity, is impertinent thereunto. Wherefore as the things themſelves treated of, are ſuch, as the moſt wiſe, knowing, and learned among Believers ought to be exerciſed in continually: So, the way and manner of their Delivery or Declaration, is accommodated unto the underſtanding and Capacity of the meaneſt of them that are ſo, that benefit may redound unto all.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> In particular inſtances and caſes relating to daily practiſe are ſo diſtinctly propoſed, ſtated and determined, as that the whole is a compleat Chriſtian directory in our walking before God in all duties of obedience; let the pious Reader ſingle out any one duty or head of duties to make his tryall upon, and if I greatly miſtake not, he will diſcerne with what wiſdome, and from what deep experience his plain directions are managed, and do proceed. As to give a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance, let him conſider what he diſcovereth concerning publick Prayer, and the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages therein, which men are lyable unto, <hi>pages 52. 53.</hi> or apply himſelf unto what he ſuppoſes himſelf more immediately concerned in, unaffected plainneſs, perſpicuous brevity, with ſolidity of judgment, will every where repreſent themſelves unto him.</p>

And thence it is that theſe Diſcourſes, (though delivered with all plainneſs of ſpeech) will not be well underſtood by any, but thoſe who in ſome meaſure have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE excellent and uſefull labors of this worthy Author, have long ſince obtained the beſt Epiſtle of commendation; even that which the great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> accounted ſo compleat a Teſtimony, as made all other commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory Epiſtles in his eſteem to appear ſuperfluous; that, I mean, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by him, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3. where he tells the believing <hi>orinthians,</hi> that <hi>they were his Epiſtle,</hi> meaning that their Converſion and graces wrought in them by his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, gave a ſufficient witneſs to the worth and dignity thereof. This Epiſtle of commendation (I ſay) God hath ſo eminently beſtowed upon the miniſterial endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of this holy man Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> both in Preſs and Pulpit, that the prefixing my Epiſtle of commendation to this excellent Expoſition of the Decalogue, was judged by my ſelf to be but an attempt, to make the Sun appear more reſplendent by the faint and feeble light of a Candle. But ſince ſome are pleaſed to put an undeſerved value upon my approbation of this worthy undertaking, I could not but upon this occaſion ſignifie that in my apprehenſion, the enſuing Treatiſe its deſign and tendency ſo advanceth holineſs of heart and life, and withal is compiled with that ſtrength and clearneſs of judgment, and holy warmth of affection, as that (by Gods bleſſing) it may preſerve and reduce many in this ſinful age from thoſe impieties, that ſo abound therein and may prove an excellent antidote againſt them, as by the good providence of God, it is brought forth in a time wherein't is coetameous with them.

               <p>The firſt is the Excellency of this Scripture, it being by the Lord himſelf intended as a comprehenſive ſum of his peoples duty, and commanded to us from this, that though all the Scripture be his Word, yet this in a ſingular manner is ſo; for he ſpake all theſe words himſelf, and by a Voice immediatly formed by himſelf he pronunced them firſt to his people, and afterward twice by his Finger (that is, immediatly by himſelf, without making uſe of any Pen-man, as in other Scriptures) he wrote them for his peoples behoof upon two Tables of Stone, which were afterwards commanded in a ſingular manner to be kept in the Ark, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 2. 5. and to be learned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 1. as alſo to be written on the Poſts of their Doors, and diligently preſſed on their Children, <hi>Deut.</hi> 67. 8. 9. 10. In opening of which Commandments, not only the Prophets and Apoſtles, but our bleſſed Lord in that Sermon of his upon the Mount, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 6. 7. doth much inſiſt,</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the uſefulneſs of this Scripture, and of the knowledge of it to all that would know what is pleaſing to God, that they may be fitted for duty to him and may know what is diſpleaſing to him; that may know ſin, and how to eſchew it, and may be ſtirred up to repentance when they have fallen into it, this being the Laws property, that thereby is the knowledge of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. and ſo likewiſe the knowledge of duty; therefore it is ſummed in ſo few words, that it may be the more eaſily brought into, and retained in the memories and hearts of his people: For which cauſe alſo of old and late, has it always been recommended, both in the Word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 1. and in all Catechiſms to be learned as a Rule of mens wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; and yet ſo comprehenſive is it, that without pains and diligence to come to the underſtanding thereof men cannot but come short of the great ſcop thereof.</p>
               <p>The third is the great ignorance, that is amongſt not a few, of the meaning of the uſeful and excellent Scripture, and eſpecially in this ſecure time, many not knowing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31633:17"/>
they break the Commandments when they break them, at leaſt in many mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial things, and this draweth with it theſe ſad effects: 1. That there are few convictions of ſin. 2. Little repentance for ſin, 3. Much ſecurity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preſumption confidence in ſelf-righteouſneſs, and the like, upon which the ignorance of this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath great influence, even as amongſt the Jews the ignorance of its Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made many neglect the chief part of holineſs, and proudly ſettle on ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſlight Chriſt the Mediator; as we may ſee in <hi>Pauls</hi> example, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. and this was one reaſon why our Lord expounded it, that by it ſinners might ſee more the neceſſity of a Mediator, who is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to all that believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. And as theſe effects are palpable at this time, ſo we conceive it uſeful to follow the ſame remedy; this evil being not only amongeſt the prophane, but amongſt the moſt formal and civil, who ſtumble at this ſtone; yea, many believers are often ſo much taken with caſes and light in Doctrinal truths, that they heed not ſnfficiently the meaning of the Law, whereby their convictions of ſin tenderneſs in practiſe, conſtant exerciſe of repentance, and daily fresh applications to the Blood of Sprinkling are much impeded.</p>
               <p>And although it may ſeem not ſo to ſuit the nature of this exerciſe (for it would be noticed, that the Author delievered this Doctrine of the Law in ſeveral Lectures on the Sabbath-morning before Sermon, in which time he formerly uſed to read and expound a Chapter of the Holy Scriptures, or a conſiderable portion thereof; which Lectures are not now diſtinguished, becauſe of the cloſe connection of the purpoſes) yet conſidering the foreſaid reaſons, and the nature of this excellent Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which cannot haſtily be paſſed through (it having much in few words, and therefore requiring ſome convenient time for explication) &amp; conſideriing the weight of it, and its uſefulneſs for all ſorts of hearers, we are confident it will agree well with the end of this Eexerciſe, (which is the end of opening all Scripture) to wit, peoples inſtruction and edification, to inſiſt a little thereon.</p>
               <p>Our purpoſe is not to aim at any great accuracy, nor to multiply queſtions and digreſſions, nor to inſiſt in application and uſe, but plainly and shortly (as we are able) to give you the meaning of the Law of God: 1. By holding forth the Native Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required every Commandment. 2. The ſins which properly oppoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict each Commandment, that by theſe we may have ſome direction and help in duty, and ſome ſpur to repentance, at leaſt a furtherance in the work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, that ſo by it we may be led to Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>who is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to every one that belives,</hi> Rom. 104. which is the principal intent of this Law, as it was given to <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make way for the Expoſition, we shall 1. Lay down ſome Concluſions which ariſe from the Preface. 2. Give you ſome ordinary diſtinctions. 3. Clear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm ſome Rules or Obſervations uſeful for underſtanding of the whole Law.</p>
               <p>The firſt Concluſion that we take for granted is, that this Law (as 'tis Moral) doth tye even Chriſtians and Believers now, as well as of old; which appears from this, that he who is God the Law-giver here, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 38. is the Angel Chriſt, and 'tis his Word, as is clear, <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. 31. as alſo the matter of it being connatural to <hi>Adam,</hi> it did bind before the Law was given, and that obligatory force cannot be ſeprated from its nature, (though the exerciſe of Right Reaſon in Nature be much obliterate ſince the Fall) therefore Chriſt was ſo far from deſtroying this Law in its Authority, and <hi>Paul</hi> ſo far from making it void by the Doctrine of Faith, that our Lord tells he came to fulfill it, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 17. and <hi>Paul</hi> shews, that his preaching of Faith was to eſtabliſh it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. which truth being confirmed by them both in their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31633:17"/>
Practiſe and Doctrine, sheweth that the breach of the holy Law of God, is no leſs ſinful to us now, then it was to them before us.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Concluſion is, that though this Law, and obedience thereto, lye on Chriſtians, and be called for from them, yet it is not laid on them as a Covenant of Works, or that by which they are to ſeek or expect Juſtification; no but on the contrary, to overturn ſelf-righteouſneſs, by this Doctrine which manifeſteth ſin and of it ſelf worketh wrath? which is alſo clear, in that he is here called, <hi>Our God,</hi> which he cannot be to ſinners but by Grace: And alſo it appears from the Lords owning of this ſinful people as his, and his adjoyning to this Law ſo many Ceremonies and Sacrifices which point out and lead to Chriſt: and from his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> as a help to the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, Geneſ.</hi> 17. (which was a Covenant of Grace, and was never altered, as to its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) in which the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as his Seed, was comprehended; therefore it appears that this was never the Lords intent in covenanting thus with his people, that they should expect righteouſneſs and life by the adjoyned Law, but only that it should be uſeful in the Hand of Grace to mak the former Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> effectual: So then, though we be bound to obey the Law, we are not to ſeek righteouſneſs or life by the duties therein enjoyned.</p>
               <p>The third Concluſion is, that both Miniſters in preaching, and people in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this Law, would carry with ſubordination to Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the duties cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for here are to be performed as a part of the Covenant of Grace, and of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that lyeth upon us thereby, &amp; ſo all our obedience to God ought ſtill to run in that Channel.</p>
               <p>If we ask how theſe two differ, to wit, the performing the duties of the Law, as running in the Channel of the Covenant of Grace, and the performing of them as running in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Channel of the Covenant of Works, or how we are to go about the duties of the Law with ſubordination to Chriſt and his Grace? I anſwer, they differ in theſe four things, which shew, that theſe duties are not onely to be done, but to be done in a way conſiſtent with, and flowing from Grace: which alſo follows from this, that in the Preface to the Commandments, he ſtileth and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himſelf forth as <hi>Redeemer</hi> to be the object of our duty, and the motive of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They differ, I ſay firſt, in the End or account upon which they are perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; we are not to perform duties that life, pardon, or enjoying of God may be meritoriouſly obtained by them, but to teſtifie our reſpect to him who hath provided theſe freely for us, that we should not reſt in duties which are engraven on theſe Covenant-Bleſſings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They differ in the Principile by which we act them, 'tis not in our own ſtrength as the works of the firſt Covenant were to be performed, but in the ſtrength of Grace, and by vertue of the promiſes of Sanctification comprehended in the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They differ as to the manner of their acceptation, duties by the firſt Covenant are to abide their tryal upon the account of their own worth, and the inherent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that is in them, and accordingly will be accepted, or rejected, as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form or diſconform to the perfect Rule of Gods Law; but by the ſecond Covenant, the acceptation of our performances, prayers, praiſes. are founded on Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and Gods mercy in him, in whom only are they ſweet-ſmelling Sacrifices, and accepted as our perſons are, for he hath made us to be accepted as to both only in the beloved <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They differ in reſpect of the motive from which they proceed; or the great
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31633:18"/>
motive of our obedience in the Covenant of Grace, is not fear of threatnings and wrath in caſe of diſobedience, which by the Covenant of Works is the main thing ſways men to duties, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is it a purchaſe of Heaven to themſelves by their holineſs, which alſo by that Covenant is a predominant motive of mens obedience, but it is love and gratitude, and that not ſimply to God as Creator, but as Redeemer, as the Text here sheweth. <hi>I brought thee out of the Houſe of Bondage,</hi> it is that we may ſet forth <hi>the praiſes of him who called us,</hi> and that we may glorifie him that has bought us: where Duties have theſe qualifications, they are conſiſtent with Grace, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to it; but when thoſe are wanting or excluded, Chriſt is wronged, and men turn legal, and in ſo far fall from and overturn Grace.</p>
               <p>Theſe Concluſions as neceſſary Caveats being laid down, we shall propoſe theſe diſtinctions for clearing of them,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We would diſtinguish betwixt a Law and a Covenant, or betwixt this Law, conſidered as a Law, and as a Covenant; a Law doth neceſſarily imply no more then 1. To direct. 2 To command, inforcing that obedience by Authority; a Covenant doth further neceſſarily imply promiſes made upon ſome condition, or threatnings ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded if ſuch a condition be not performed: now this Law may be conſidered without the conſideration of a Covenant, for it was free to God to have added, or not to have added promiſes, and the threatnings (upon ſuppoſition the Law had been kept) might never have taken effect; but the firſt two are eſſential to the Law, the laſt two, to Believers, are made void throngh Chriſt; in which ſenſe it is ſaid, that by him we are freed from the Law as a Covenant, ſo that Believers life depends not on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes annexed to the Law, nor are they in danger by the threatning adjoyned to it: Hence we are to advert when the Covenant of Works is ſpoken of, that by it is not meaned this Law ſimply, but the Law propounded as the condition of obtaining life by the obedience of it; in which reſpect it was only ſo formally given to <hi>Adam:</hi> This then is the firſt deſtinction betwixt the Law, and the Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Diſtinguish betwixt theſe Ten Commandments ſimply and ſtrictly taken in the matter of them, and more complexly in their full Adminiſtration, with Preface, Promiſes, Sacrifices, &amp;c, in the firſt ſenſe they are a Law having the matter, but not the form of the Covenant of Works: ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> by it is ſaid to deſcribe ſuch righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as the Covenant of Works doth require, yet he doth not propond it as the righteouſneſs they were to relye on, but his ſcope is to put them to a Mediators, by revealing ſin through the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. In the ſecond ſenſe it is a Covenant of Grace, that ſame in ſubſtance with the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and with the Covenant made with Believers now, but differing in its Adminiſtration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Diſtinguish betwixt Gods intention in giving, and the Believers in <hi>Iſrael</hi> their making uſe of this Law, and the carnal multitude among that people their way of receiving it, and corrupt abuſing it contray to the Lords mind: In the firſt ſenſe it was a Covenant of Grace, in the ſecond, it turned to be a Covenant of Works to them; and therefore it is that the Lord rejects as we may ſee <hi>Jſaiah</hi> 1. 13. 66. 2. 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 22. their Sacrifices and Services as not commanded, becauſe reſted on by them to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Grace, and contrary to the ſtrain and ſcope of this Law complexly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Diſtinguish betwixt the Moral, and Ceremonial, and Judicial Law; the firſt concerns manners, and the right ordering of a Godly Converſation; and becauſe theſe things are of perpetual equity and rectitude, the obligation of this Law as to that is perpetual; and therefore in the exponding of it, theſe two terms, <hi>Moral,</hi> and of <hi>Perpetual Authority,</hi> are all one, and to be taken ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. The <hi>Judical</hi> Law is for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31633:18"/>
regulating outward Society, &amp; for Government, and doth generally (excepting what was peculiar to the people of <hi>Iſrael)</hi> agree with the Moral Law; this as given to them is not perpetual, their policy being at an end. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law is in Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, Types, and Shadows, pointing at a Saviour to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is alſo abrogate, the ſubſtance being come; but there is this difference, that the Judicial Law is but <hi>Mortua,</hi> dead; and may, where't is thought fit, with the fore-going caution, be uſed under the New Teſtament; but the Ceremonial Law is <hi>Mortifera,</hi> deadly, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without falling from grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. be revived.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When we ſpeak of things Moral, we are to diſtinguish between things <hi>Natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Moral,</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch (as love to God and our Neighbour, and ſuch-like) which have an innate rectitude and holineſs in them, which cannot be ſeparate from them, and things <hi>poſitively Moral,</hi> that have their obligation by a ſpecial poſitive ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added Sanction, ſothat their rectitude flows not from the nature of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as in the former: As for inſtance, in the fourth Commandment it is naturally Moral that God should be woshipped, Nature teacheth it; but that he is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped on ſuch a day particularly, that comes to paſs by vertue of his poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; the firſt cannot be altered, the ſecond by the Lord may; but till he alter it, the Authority lies ſtill on all, and it is equally ſin to ſin againſt any of them, though without the poſitive Sanction, there is no obligation naturaly requiring obedience in ſome of them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſixth diſtinction is of the Moral Law in two Tables, firſt and ſecond; The firſt contains our immediate worship, and ſervice and obedience to God himſelf, and is comprehended in the firſt four Commandments; the ſecond contains our mediate obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God in all the duties we owe to other, in the laſt ſix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were at firſt ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by the Lord himſelf, for there are Ten in all, <hi>Dent.</hi> 4. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> From this diſtinction take notice: 1. That all the Commandments of the ſecond Table are of like Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the firſt, <hi>God ſpake all theſe words;</hi> yea, as it appears from <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 38. it was our Lord Jeſus. 2. The ſins immediately againſt the firſt Table, are greater then thoſe againſt the ſecond; for this cauſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 38. the firſt is called the <hi>Firſt and Great Commandment:</hi> Therefore 3. In Morals (if they be things of the ſame nature) the duties of the ſecond Table cede and give place to the duties of the firſt Table, when they cannot ſtand together; as in the caſe of love to God, and the exerciſe of love to our Father and Neighbour, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. <hi>Matth.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0. 37. when obedience to God and obedience to our ſuperiours cannot conſiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are <hi>to obey God rather then man, Acts</hi> 4. 19. and we are to <hi>lore the Lord, and hate Father and Mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Luke</hi> 14. 6. 4. Yet take notice, that Ceremonials or poſitives of the firſt Table, for a time cede and give place to Morals in the ſecond; as for relieving or preſerving our Neighbours life in hazard, we may travel on the Sabbath day, according to that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice, and the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſeventh diſtinction (which is ordinary) is of the Commandments into affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative and negative, as ye ſee all the Commandments in the firſt Table are negatively ſet down, forbidding ſin directly: <hi>Thou shalt not have an other gods,</hi> &amp;c. only the fourth is both negative and affirmative, forbidding ſin, and commanding duty direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as alſo the fifth only, which is the firſt of the ſecond Table, is affirmative, all the reſt are negative.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction is not ſo to be underſtood, as if nothing were commanded or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in negative Precepts, or as if nothing were forbidden in affirmative Precepts (for what ever be expreſſed as forbidden, the contrary is alwayes in plyed as comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31633:19"/>
and whatſoever is expreſly commanded, the contrary is alwayes implyed as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden) but the diſtinction is taken from the manner of ſetting them down, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which take theſe Rules or general Obſervations for your better underſtanding, many whereof are in the larger Catechiſm.</p>
               <p n="1">1. However the Commandments be expreſſed, affirmatively or negatively, every one of them hath two parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one affirmative, implyed in negative Precepts, requiring the duties that are contray to the ſins forbidden; another negative, implyed in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative Precepts, forbidding the ſins that are contrary to the duties commanded; as for example the third Commandment, <hi>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain;</hi> it implies a Command reverently to uſe his Name: So, <hi>to remember to keep Holy the Satbbath day,</hi> implies a Prohibition of prophaning it; in which ſenſe all the Commandments may in ſome reſpect be called negative (and ſo a part of the fourth Commandment is negatively expreſſed, <hi>Thou shalt d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>no work)</hi> or affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; in which reſpect Chriſt comprehendeth all the negatives under theſe two great affirmative Commandments, <hi>of love to God and our Neighbour,</hi> for every Commandment doth both enjoyn and forbid; the like may be ſaid of promiſes and threatnings, there being in every promiſe a threatning, and in every threatning a promiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally implyed: And this may be a reaſon why ſome Commandments are negatively expreſſed, ſome poſitively, to show us that both are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dended.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though the poſitive Commandment, or (the poſitive part of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) be of alike force and Authority with the negative, as to the obligation it layeth on us to duty, yet it doth not tye us to all occaſions and times, as negatives do: Hence is that common Maxime, that affirmative Commands tye and oblige <hi>ſemper</hi> ever, that is, they never want their Authority, and we are never abſolved from their obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they do not oblige and tye <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> that is, in all differences of time we are not tyed to the exerciſe of the duties enjoyned; negatives again oblige both <hi>ſomper and ad ſemper,</hi> that is, alwayes, and in all differences of time: For inſtance, in the third Commandment, the affirmative part is to uſe the Lords Name and Ordinances holily and reverently in prayer, reading and hearing, &amp;c. So in the fourth Commandment we are required to ſanctifie the Sabbath, by wating on Ordinances, &amp;c. This makes theſe ſtill duties, ſo as to pray, hear, &amp;c. are ſtill duties, but we are not to be, and should not be alwayes exerciſed in theſe duties, for we muſt abound in other duties alſo of neceſſity, and mercy, we muſt eat, and ſleep, &amp;c. and when we ſleep, we can neither act love, nor ſear. Again, the negative part is, not to prophane the Lords Name in his Ordinances; this may not be done at any time: The reaſon of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is this, becauſe in affirmatives we are not alwayes tyed to the acts of Duties and Graces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to the Diſpoſition and Habit. Habits are a Spiritual Quality, a <hi>(Vis)</hi> or Power ſitting and enabling for bringing forth theſe acts; and for the bringing them forth in the due time and ſeaſon, when they shall be called for; but in ſinful things we are prohibited, not only the habits, but the acts alſo: the one is alwayes and ever a ſin, but the other is not alwayes called for as duty. If any deſire Rules to know when a duty is called for; as for inſtance, when we are to pray, hear, &amp;c. it is hardly poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be particular in this, yet we may try it by theſe Generals.</p>
               <p n="1">1, Any affirmative Precept binds to preſent practiſe, when the duty required tends to Gods glory, unto which every thing should be done (as 1 <hi>Corinth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 10. 31.) and when the omiſſion of the duty may dishonour him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When it tends to others edification, and omitting will ſome way ſtumble and offend.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:31633:19"/>
3. When ſome ſpecial Providences meet and concur, to give opportunity for ſuch a duty; as for inſtance, the giving of Aims when we have it, and ſome indigent perſon offers, whoſe neceſſity calls for it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. So when ſecrecy for prayer is offered, (and no other more neceſſary duty at that time is called for) which we are to watch unto, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 2. or when we meet with ſome ſpecial occaſion or Diſpenſation, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to us this or that as a duty called for, ſuch a Providence invites us to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of that duty: for though Providences will not make theſe things to become du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are not duties, yet they will ſerve to time and circumſtantiate duties that lye on us, by vertue of affirmative Precepts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some ſpecial occaſions and times are ſet down in the Word, as for praying Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening, for hearing the Word on Sabbath days; and in theſe, and other the like duties, the examples of the Saints, ſo recorded for imitation in Scripture, would be obſerved as a Copy and patern.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When they have not ſuch inconveniences with them, as croſs and hinder other Moral duties of Edification, love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. for if they do that, they muſt yield and give place to theſe; but if no other duty be called for, then they ought to be done, for we should be in ſome duty. And though ſuch dnties be in themſelves Moral, ſuppoſe praying, hearing, and ſuch others, which might be inſtanced, yet the timing of them, or going about them at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not Moral ſimply, but as theſe are by circumſtances called for.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When without ſin ſuch a duty cannot be omitted; and although there be not any inward exerciſe of mind, or frame of ſpirit ſutable thereto, yet the Conſcience calls for it, or there is ſome on ſpecial occaſion or other that puts us to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Obſerve, that this Rule of Negatives tying <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> or obliging in all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time, is not to be underſtood, but where the matter is Moral; therefore we would diſtinguish again betwixt negative Morals, and negative Poſitives, for Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, whether negative or affirmative, give ſtill place to Morals, As for inſtance, that part of the fourth Commandment is negative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>In it</hi> (that is, one the ſeventh day) <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ou shalt do no manner of work,</hi> yet ſometimes, when neceſſity calls for it, ſome manner of works is lawful on that day, becauſe it is only a negative Poſitive, and not a negative Moral: And ſo <hi>David's</hi> eating of Shew-bread, was againſt a negative Command, though not againſt a negative Moral, but a negative Poſitive.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Take this Rule, that in all Commands, joyntly and ſeverally, we would have ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reſpect unto the ſcope God aims at by them all in general, or by ſuch a Command in particular: now the general ſcope is (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) perfect and abſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lute holineſs, even as he is holy; and therefore whatever he requires, he requires that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it be abſolutely perfect in its kind, as that our love to him be with the whole heart, &amp;c. and ſo our love to others be as to our ſelves; our Chaſtity and Purity, all muſt be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. (ſee 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5.) This Rule will teach us what we are to aim and level at: And whatever Expoſition of the Commandments comes not up to this ſcope, is no doubt defective; and by this Rule only can we be helped to the right meaning of every Commandment, for each of them has its peculiar ſcope, both as to the duties it requires, and ſins it condemns. And by this Rule it is that our Lord Chriſt (whoſe Expoſition with that of the Prophets is beſt) draws in the leaſt and ſmalleſt branches of filthineſs to the ſeventh Commandment, which diſchargeth all things contrary to perfect and compleat Purity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth Rule is, that the Law is ſpiritual, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14. and that not only outward obedience to ſuch duties, or outward abſtinence from ſuch ſinful acts is called for, but the Law, having a ſpiritual meaning, calls for ſpiritual ſervice, and that in theſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31633:20"/>
three: 1. As it requires ſpiritual duties, ſuch as Faith, Fear, Love to God, and <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> others; right habits, as well as right affections, and outward actions, and therefo<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> to prove the ſpirituality of the Law, inſtanceth in the habit of Luſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> a thing thereby diſcharged. 2. The Law is ſpiritual, in that the obligation thereof reaches to the Spirite, and very inwards of the Heart, affections and thoughts, as wel<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as to the outward man; the love it requires, is love with all the Soul, Heart and Mind. Hence there is Heart-Idolatry, Murder, and Adultery, as well as outward, therein condemned. 3. It is ſpiritual, in reſpect of the manner; it requires as to all outward duties, that they be done to a ſpiritual end, from a ſpiritual principle, and in a ſpirital way, oppoſite to the carnal way, to which the unrenewed heart of man is inclined, in which ſenſe we are commanded to walk in the ſpirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16. and ſo praying and praiſing, which this Law calls for, is praying and praiſing in the ſpirit, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 14, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A ſixth Rule is, that beſide the duty expreſſed, there is more implyed in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative Commands; and beſide the ſin pitched on, there is more forbidden in the negative Precepts, even all duties and ſins of theſe kinds, in whatſoever degree: As for example, in the affirmative Commands: 1. Where the duty is commanded, all the means that may further it are commanded likewiſe: Hence under care to preſerve our Brother, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17. 18. it is commanded that we should reprove him, &amp;c. 2. Where any thing is commanded as a duty, all duties of that kind are commanded, as keeping holy the Lords Day, is commanded in the fourth Commandment: there hearing, praying, watchfulneſs all the Week over, and all things belonging unto the Worship of God that day, ſuch as Tythes, that is, maintenance for a Miniſtry, calling of fit Miniſters, bulding Churches, &amp;c. are required, though they be not all duties of that day. 3. Where a duty is required, the owning and ſuitable avowing of the duty is required alſo: and ſo believing in God, and the profeſſion of Faith are required in the ſame Commandment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10. 4. Where the duty of one Relation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puired (as of Childrens ſubjection) there is required the duty of the other Relation (as of Parents) yea, and alſo of all under that name.</p>
               <p>Again, in negative Precept; obſerve: 1. Where great ſins are forbidden, all the leſſer of that ſort are forbidden alſo: as under Adultery, Murder, and Idolatry, all light, obſcene Whorish words, wanton looks, unchaſte thoughts, revenge, rash anger, wordly affections, &amp;c. are forbidden; and they are comprehended and prohibited under the groſſeſt terms, to make them the more deteſtable, odious, and dreadfull. 2. All means that may prevent theſe ſins are commanded, and all ſnares, or occaſions, or incitements to them are prohibited. 3. Where any ſin is forbidden, there the leaſt ſcandal about it, or the leaſt appearance of the guilt of committing it, is forbidden alſo; for God will have his people holy, and shining in holineſs, unſpotted, and without ſcandal, and abſtaining not only from all evil, but from all appearance of it, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 22. 4. We are not only forbidden the committing of ſuch ſins our ſelves, delighting in them, and inclining to them, but accounting light or little of them in others; yea, we are commanded and ought to mourn for them, when committed by them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſeventh Rule is, whatever duty lies upon others, we are commanded in our places to further them in it, as Maſters are to further their Servants, Husbands their Wives, one Neighbour another; by advice, direction, incouragement, prayer, and other helps, as in the fourth Commandment is clear, where the Servants duty, &amp; the Strangers, is impoſed on the Maſter; and whatever ſin is diſcharged in our ſelves, we are diſcharged any manner of way to partake in the ſame with others, whether by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, example, connivance, miniſtring occaſion, or by ſporting and laughing at it in

               <p n="10">10. The tenth and laſt Rule is, the Law is holy, juſt, and good: therefore the leaſt motion againſt it, or diſcontentment with it, is ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12. In ſum: take theſe few watch-words concerning the obligation of the Law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it obligeth to all duties, and to all ſorts of duties, publick, private to God, to others, and to our ſelves: and that words, actions, geſtures, yea thoughts, and the leaſt motions of the heart, come under its obligation: his Commandment is exceeding broad, ſo that there is nothing ſo little, but it ought to be ruled by this Word, and that in all perſons of all Ranks, whether as to doing or ſuffering.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it obligeth to the right manner of duties, as well as to the matter, and to every thing that belongeth to duties; and thus in its true extent it reacheth to the forbidding of all the ſins that are contrary to duties commanded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it obligeth the whole man, the outward, in deeds, words, geſtures, and appearances or shews; the inward, in the underſtanding, will, affections, memory; conſciences; and ſo it requires that the mind, will, and whole nature be ſanctified, and conform to all theſe Commands.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That it obligeth to obedience in all theſe alwayes, and in the higheſt degree, ſo that the leaſt diſconformity in habit or act is a tranſgreſſion, the obedience it requires is perfect in all theſe reſpects, that not only there muſt be no breach of any of theſe Commands directly, much leſe a continuance in a breach; but that alſo 1. There muſt be no appearance of breaking them, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 2. 2. There muſt be no conſent to break them, though it come not forth to act, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 28. There muſt be no caſting our ſelves in the way of any temptation or ſnare, whereby we may be inticed or occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (to ſpeak ſo) to break them; as <hi>Davil</hi> was by his looking on a woman, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2. which <hi>Job</hi> guards againſt, <hi>Job</hi> 31. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. there muſt be no corrupt motion, affection, or inclination to evil, even where it gets not aſſent, there muſt be no tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of delight in the thing, though the heart dare not conſent to act it, nor any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment with the reſtraint that keepeth from ſuch a thing, or ſecret wishing that ſuch a thing were lavvful; but on the contrary, we muſt account every commanded thing right, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 128.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The involuntary motions of the mind which never get aſſent to any of theſe evils, nor are delighted in, yet even theſe are prohibited by this Law, becauſe they flow from a corrupt Fountain, and are the Evidences of diſconformity to Gods Image in our nature, and they ought not ſo much as to be in us. Hence doth the Apoſtle complain of luſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. though reſiſted by him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It teacheth not only to ſtreams of actual corruption, but to the Fountain of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin, whereby we entertain within us the ſeed and incentives unto actual evils that contradict this holy Law. By all which we may ſee what holineſs it calls for, and how
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31633:21"/>
often (if we were examined in all the Commands by theſe Rules) we would be found defective and faulty, and what matter of humiliation and repentance we may have for what is paſt, and what challenges we may have hereafter from this Law, with what need of continual applications to the Blood of Sprinkling, and of Waſhings in that open Fountain, to the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for ſin and uncleanneſs, and what need of endeavours to have our ſteps ordered more exactly according to it.</p>
               <p>Before we cloſe the Preface, I shall firſt add two diſtinctions more, then two more Rules: 3. Give you ſome Scriptures for your memories cauſe, 4. Give ſome directions or helps to thoſe who make conſcience to ſtudy this Law. 5. Anſwer and clear a ſpecial caſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then ye would diſtinguish betwixt this Law as given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and as given to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> for as given to him it was a Covenant of Works, but as given to them it's a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and ſo from us now it calls for Goſpel-duties, as Faith in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. Repentance, Hope in God, &amp;c. and although it call for legal duties, yet in a Goſpel manner; therefore we are in the firſt Commandment commanded to have God for our God, which cannot be by ſinners obeyed, but in Chriſt Jeſus, the Covenant of Works being broken, and the tye of Friendship thereby between God and Man made void; ſo that now men, as to that Covenant, are without God in the World, and without Chriſt and the Promiſes, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. 13. And ſo our having God for our God, (which is pointed at in the Preface to the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) and Chriſt for our Saviour, and cloſing with his Righteouſneſs, and the Promiſes of the Covenant (which are all Yea and Amen in him) muſt go together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Diſtinguish betwixt the divers Adminiſtrations of the Covenant of Grace, and of the Law, in reſpect of Poſitives, falling under the ſecond Commandment; for that Commandment tyed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> before Chriſt to Circumciſion, Sacrifices, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the Week, and other Ceremonies agreeable to the Adminiſtration of the Law, and Covenant of Grace then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but now it forbiddeth them to us, and requireth other duties, for the Prieſt-hood being changed, there is of neceſſity a change alſo of the Laws belonging thereto; yet that Commandment, as a part of the Moral Law, doth perpetually oblige and tye to worship God, and none other, and that according to the manner which he preſcribes.</p>
               <p>Next unto the Rules already laid down for the better underſtanding of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, we add two more.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that the Commandements are ſo to be expounded, as that none of them may contradict another, that is, there is nothing commanded in one that is forbidden in another, or contrary; one duty doth not juſtle with not thruſt out another, but they differ only; and then two duties coming together, in that caſe one of them ceaſeth to be a duty for that time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is ſaid in that diſtinction of affirmative and negative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Rule is, that all theſe Commandments bind and call for obedience from men, according to their places, and other qualifications and circumſtances: The fifth Commandment calleth for one thing from a Magiſtrate, another from a Subject; a Magiſtrate is to edifie one way, a Miniſter another, a private Chriſtian another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is one way to reprove his Fellow-ſervant, a Maſter another way: The Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more from a man of parts, power and riches, then from another, as to exerciſe and improvement of theſe gifts: The Law being juſt, has in it a proportionableneſs to places, parts, &amp;c. and ſets bounds to ſtations, but alters them not, nor confounds them.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:31633:21"/>
3. For the help of your memories, and that ye may have theſe Rules more obvious, ye may draw them all under theſe five Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The firſt Scripture is, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. <hi>v.</hi> 96. <hi>Thy Commandment is exceeding broad;</hi> which though it be more extenſive in its meaning, yet it doth certainly include this Law, which in an eſpecial way is <hi>the Commandment,</hi> and in the ſenſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive meaning thereof is <hi>exceeding broad;</hi> for it takes in the fulneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the whole Law, in its obligation, as to all things, perſons, and duties of all ſorts.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Scripture is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14. which ſpeaks to the Spirituality of the Law in the obedience which it calleth for, <hi>the Law is Spiritual,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Scripture is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12. which ſpeaks the perfection of its nature, <hi>the Law is Juſt;</hi> therefore fretting againſt what it commandeth, or wishing it were otherwiſe, is a breach thereof; <hi>It is holy;</hi> therefore to be diſcomformable unto it, is to be unholy; it's good, and therefore it ought to be loved and delighted in.</p>
               <p>The fourth Scripture is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. and it ſpeaketh the great end of the Law; <hi>The end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure Heart, and a good Conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Faith unfeigned;</hi> which threefold End ſpeaketh out the abſolute purity and holineſs called for in our love to God and others, ſo as to have a good conſcience in this before God: all which muſt flow from unfeigned Faith without preſumption, reſting on Jeſus Chriſt, who is in this ſenſe the end of the Law.</p>
               <p>The fifth Scripture is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>The Law is good, if a man uſe it lawfully:</hi> and this guards againſt abuſing of the Law, and putteth us to the lawful uſe of it: There are extreams in abuſing the Law; as 1. When it is uſed to ſee Righteouſneſs by it. Again 2. When the Authority of it is pretended for ſomething it Warrants not, ſuch as the Traditions of the Fathers, <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. ſeeking of Salvation by the obſervation of Circumciſion, &amp;c. 3. When its Authority in practiſe is denyed. 4. When it is turned from practiſe to vain ſpeculations and queſtions. 5. When it is ſo uſed as it deters and ſcares from Chriſt. 6. When it is ſo made uſe of, as it oppreſſes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages a Believer, for whoſe ſake (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19.) it was never made or appointed, as to its threatnings and condemning Power: And laſtly, in a word, when it is not uſed to the ends, and in the manner expreſſed, in the former Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becauſe the ſtudy of this Law is ſo ſingularly uſeful, we not only preſs &amp; commend it, but add further ſome few directions, whereby we may be helped rightly to uſe it, and to guard againſt the abuſe of it in our hearing and reading of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt direction is, ye would look on it as Gods Word, and take it as if ye heard himſelf from <hi>Sinai</hi> pronounce it, that ſo ye may tremble; and be more affected with holy fear when ever ye read, hear it, or meditate upon it; for ſo was the people affected when it was firſt promulgate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be much in prayer for grace to take up its meaning; <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 119. 18, &amp;c.) prayed often for this, and thought it not unbecoming a King, yea a believing King, and a Prophet, to ſtudy this Law, and pray much for opened eyes to underſtand the meaning thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In your reading ſeek to underſtand ſo as to practiſe it, for that is the end of knowledge, and the end the Law it ſelf aims at, <hi>Deuv.</hi> 5. 1. 2. we knowing no more in Gods account then what we endeavour honeſtly to practiſe; and not aiming at pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, indiſpoſeth both for underſtanding and practiſe, and makes men exceeding careleſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As ye hear and learn any thing to be duty or ſin, reflect on your ſelves, and try whether that be ſin in you, and how far short ye are in that duty, for this is the proper
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31633:22"/>
uſe of the Law, to reveal ſin and tranſgreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>8. and therefore it is ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed a <hi>Glaſs, Jam.</hi> 1. 23. 24. and ye would look in it ſo as ye may know what manner of perſons ye are, and may know what ſports are upon you.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When the Law diſcovers ſin, ye would open your Boſom to let in Convictions; for the Law entered that ſin might abound, not in practiſe, but in ſenſe feeling, and conſcience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 20. and follow theſe Convictions by repentance, till they neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate you to flye to Chriſt, and leave you there.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Take help from Chriſts Sermons, and the Prophets, to underſtand this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for they are the only Canonical; and therefore the beſt Commentary upon the Commandments; yet ye would not deſpiſe the light holden forth in humane wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, ſuch as the larger Catechiſm, which is very full as to this, and if concionably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, will prove exceeding profitable for your inſtruction.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Grave Caſe that we would ſpeak unto, before we enter particularly on the Commandments is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether any of theſe Commandments may be broken in our ſleep, by Dreams, Imaginations, Actions, &amp;c. which otherwiſe are unlawful, or whether when a man is ſleeping and dreaming he be ſubject to the Rule of the Law, and if its obligation extend to him even then? This queſtion hath its own difficulty, and althought it be not good to be curious in it, yet it wants not its own profit, as to the peace and quietneſs of Gods people, or to their humbling and ſtirring up unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, if it be rightely decided. I know almoſt all run on the negative, as if men were not in the leaſt guilty of ſin by ſuch Dreams<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon this ground, upon this ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not then in a capacity to uſe and exerciſe their reaſon, but that they are in this caſe as mad, diſtracted, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> frantick men. I deſire to be ſober in ſpeaking to this; yet I shall adventure to ſpeak my mind a little about it, with the reaſons of it.</p>
               <p>And 1. we ſay there is a great difference betwixt ſleeping dreaming men, and mad-men. 1. Becauſe madneſs is wholly in it ſelf penal, and is a diſeaſe following ſinful man as other diſeaſes: but ſo it cannot be ſaid of ſuch dreaming; for as ſleep was natural (there being before <hi>Adams</hi> Fall a Day and a Night as well as now, and there being an inſtance then of <hi>Adams</hi> ſleeping) ſo muſt dreaming be, being procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the reſtleſneſs of the Fancy; and the roving of the Imaginations, which is ſome way natural; but that men dream of ſuch ſubjects, or that their dreams are of ſuch a nature (as filthy or prophaine) ſeems clearly to follow ſin, which dreaming ſimply doth not; and therefore man is not ſo paſſive in this, as in madneſs. 2. Becauſe in dreams men have more uſe of Reaſon, then in madneſs, though (as the School-men ſay) that uſe be imperfect, yet as they grant (and Experience confirmeth it, and <hi>Auguſtine lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Confeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> acknowledgeth it in himſelf) their may reaſon and debate in ſleep, yea ſometimes reject ſome motions, and though dreaming yet not give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto them; and that upon reaſons which at other times poſſibly they will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace. Hence is it that there is a ſort of ſutableneſs and likeneſs betwixt mens dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their rational actings when walking; children and mad men, or men in a diſtemper, having more foolishneſe and leſs reaſon in dreams, then theſe who have more uſe of reaſon; but wiſe men in a diſtraction, and natural fools, have no ſuch difference then: Beſide, we conceive that dreaming is more proper to reaſonable men then Beaſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to men that have exerciſe of reaſon then to children, but madneſs may be in all. 3. Becauſe a mans former carriage in moral things hath much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on his dreams when he has clear uſe of reaſon, then it can be ſaid to have upon him when in madneſs, as to the things committed by him in it. 4. Neither is it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome weight, that under the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 10. Sacrifices and Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were appointed for ſome ſins committed in ſleep and dreaming (whatever they be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31633:22"/>
in themſelves) which were not appointed for the ſins of ſuch as were frantick: All which put together, and duly conſidered, we cannot look upon ſins, I mean things otherwiſe unlawful, in dreaming; and ſins in diſtraction, as equal.</p>
               <p>Yet ſecondly, there be ſome things that we willingly grant in this matter: As 1. That we do not comprehend under theſe ſinful dreams every paſſing tranſient thought or motion in ſleep, which has meerly an idleneſs and unprofitableneſs with it, which though it might poſſibly be ſiuful in men waking, (when they ſhould aim in the leaſt thought at ſomething edifying) yet we think dreams that are meerly (ſo to ſay) negative, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not ſinful on the matter, are not to be accounted ſins; nay, not yet ſins hiſtorically, as it were, objected to the fancy, or only objectively propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay they are not ſinful, becauſe mans fancy at ſuch a time is open to ſuch Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cannot hold them out, eſpecially ſeeing they may poſſibly be carried in by the Devil, who certainly waits theſe times; but there are other ſinful dreams, ſuch as that ſpoken of, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. through occaſion of which there is effuſion of ſeed, riſing in paſſion, delighting in revenge, it may be (as we have heard) to the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſome act, ſuch have (as it were) a more diliberate conſent with them, and ſometimes delight, yea, ſometimes external motion of the body endeavouring the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments of its deſires: in all which it ſeems hard to ſay, that a man is paſſive only; and when the ſubject of the dreams are ſuch things as a natural Conſcience will ſcare and tremble at, it is of theſe we ſpeak.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We conceive there is a great difference, as to degrees of ſinfulneſs, betwixt ſuch ſinful motions, deſires, delectations, &amp;c. that are in a waking man, and the ſame in one a ſleep; the guilt is much leſs by many degrees in the one, then in the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A difference is to be made betwixt groſs ſins objectively repreſented to the fancy in ſleep, and the ſame ſins which are not only ſorepreſented, but alſo have more ſetled motions following thereon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a difference alſo betwixt diſtempered men in their dreams of this kind, and men who are ſober, and well at themſelves; yet we cannot but incline to think, that there is ſome guilty that may and ought to be repented of in ſuch dreams, and ſo that men may in their ſleep ſin againſt theſe holy Commandments, ſeeing that in <hi>many dreams,</hi> as in many words, <hi>there are divers</hi> (even ſinful) <hi>vanities, Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
               <p>This Truth is ſomething clear from the grounds already laid down; but we shall for further clearing and confirming of it, and theſe following Arguments. The firſt is this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That tickling delight, as an evil againſt the Law of God, is a fruit of original ſin, which ſin infects all our imaginations, and make them evil, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 6. 5. yea, they are the flowings out of habitual luſt, which is now natural to us; and if they be a Fruit of that Tree, or a Daughter of that Mother, muſt they not be of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo ſinful? and that they muſt flow from Original ſin, may thus be made out; That none can imagine ſuch dreams to have been incident to <hi>Adam,</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency, while all was pure, even though ſleep and dreams were natural to him: And this may be confirmed from that one Maxime of the School-men, that <hi>Adams</hi> Innocency was capable of no deception, nor of any thing which might make him ſad, either ſleeping or waking; but ſuch dreams certainly imply both. If it be ſaid, ſuch dreams may be from an external cauſe, as the Devils objecting ſuch and ſuch things to men in ſleep: I anſwer, I grant in part it may be ſo; but 1. Though he object them to us ſleeping as well as waking, yet it is, we that entertain theſe objected Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it is we that delight in them, and move by them, though tempted thereto by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31633:23"/>
him: we may ſay he is Father and as it is, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 3. <hi>he filleth the heart,</hi> and furniſheth fewel; but we are the Mother (I ſay it is our corruption) that bringeth forth, and can any ſay, that if there were no corruption within us, that theſe would be ſo entertained? 2. Though they come from him as an external cauſe, yet conſidering that our nature is inclined to ſuch things, ſo that Powder or Flax taketh no ſooner with Fire caſt into them, then our corrupt nature doth with theſe temptations: Is it poſſible to imagine that a Dart of temptation should be thrown in, and not at leaſt awake and ſtir the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of corruptions? Indeed, pure Nature in our bleſſed Lord (who was without Original ſin) was like water, preſently to quench all ſuch Fiery Darts. 3. If they come from the Devil, to what end can he object them to men; it muſt either be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſinful, that being his aim to defile them thereby, and draw them to ſin, or becauſe they are troubleſome and heavy to men, he having delight alſo in mens mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, but ſuch dreams are no way weighty and troubleſome to the moſt part of men, that therefore is not his aim, nor would they be ſo much burdenſome to others, were it not from their apprehenſion of guilt under them; and therefore Satans aim muſt be thereby to defile men with ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Argument which confirmeth the former, (and let us conſider it with reverence) our bleſſed Lord Jeſus was made in all things like unto us, except ſin, none of the fruits of original ſin, which are ſinful, are to be found in him; and yet, I ſuppoſe, none can without horrour imagine ſuch dreams to have been incident to him, or that his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Holineſs was capable of them. He is the only inſtance of one free from original ſin, yet may he be ſuppoſed lyable to any other penal thing, excepting 1. What im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies ſin. 2. What implies diſtempers and infirmities in the contemperature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his body from inward cauſes, becauſe he had no inward cauſe, being free of ſin as <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall; and therefore not naturally (I mean from inward principles, or neceſſity, as we are) ſubject to ſickneſs or death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Argument is, That men are often acceſſary to theſe ſinful dreams them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, either 1. By exceſs, diſpoſing themſelves to ſuch inclinations, or 2. By a looſe mind that delights in following ſuch things throughout the day in their more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meditations, and more determinate purpoſes; it being ordinary, that dreams fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low much the conſtitution of the body, or the habitual ſtrain of our practiſe: in which reſpect mens Callings, or particular Imployments, will run up and down before the Fancy in their ſleep, and ſo their ſinful exerciſes alſo: or 3. By not praying to God to guard againſt them, and neglecting to preſs more after mortification for that end: or 4. By not being ſuitably affected with them after they are paſt and gone: In which caſes even the School-men (who are not the moſt rigid and tender Caſuiſts) will grant (all things being conſidered) ſin to be <hi>ex conſequenti</hi> in dreams; and we ſuppoſe few fall in ſuch dreams, who may not in one circumſtance or other read their acceſſion to ſin therein, and though our frame and conſtitution be in it ſelf na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, yet that it should incline us ſleeping or waking to any thing ſinful, that is and muſt be from corrupt nature, ſeeing it clearly ſpeaketh the inordinateneſs of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclination.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Argument is from the Law of Washings and Sacrificings for the ſin of uncleanneſs in mens dreams, when they paſs ſeed in their ſleep, which ſeemeth to ſay thus much, that both ſleeping and waking men should be holy; and although there be ſacrifices and cleanſings appointed for ſomethings that are not morally ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as the touching of a dead body, having Leproſie, &amp;c. yet ſimply to ſay ſo of the caſe in hand were hard: For 1. If it be ſaid there was no moral ſinfulneſs in that kind of pollutions, what then could theſe Sacrifices and Washings ſignifie? If any ſay,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31633:23"/>
as they muſt ſay, they looked to ſecret actings of original ſin, it doth confirm what we have ſaid: But 2. Is there in any ſuch things as are not accounted ſinful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſuch a dependency upon, or likeneſs to any Commandment, as there is in that which is mentioned <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. to the ſeventh Commandment, to which it ſeemeth to have a direct reference?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth Argument may be taken from the extent of the Law, which reacheth to the whole man outward and inward, ſoul, heart, mind, and if to the whole man, then why not to the fancy, memory, imagination, &amp;c. And we are ſure when Spirits are made perfectly comform to the Law of God, there will not be found in them any ſuch fancy imaginable as conſiſtent with it: Beſides, doth not this Law oblige and tye alwayes? even ſleeping men (as we conceive) are under the negative Precepts of it, that is, although they be not bound to pray and hear in their ſleep, yet they are bound not to Murder, nor commit Adultery, &amp;c. in their ſleep; and the more renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and holy Chriſtians are in their ordinary walk, ſo are they in their dreams; and even in this ſanctified perſons differ from unrenewed ones.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſixth Argument it this, we ſuppoſe theſe grounds that prove involuntary luſt in the firſt motions thereof, and before they can come to conſent to be ſin, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe motions in ſleeping men (of which we ſpeak) to be ſinful alſo: For 1. Though theſe motions of luſt be involuntary, and weaken not the deliberate uſe of Reaſon more then the other: And 2. Though they be in the Regenerate wreſtled againſt, and not approved more then the other, yet becauſe theſe are not according to reaſon, (though not brought forth by it) and not anſwerable to that ſimple purity and Angelick holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which should be in man, and it is hard to imagine the moſt paſſing motions of luſt running never ſo ſwiftly through us, not to leave behind them ſome dreg of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement by reaſon of our corruption, that ſideth ſtill in leſs or more with temptation (which cannot be ſaid of ſins objected by the Tempter to our Lord) and ſuch luſts, or motions of luſt, have ſtill by the Orthodox, according to <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. been thought ſinful upon the foreſaid reaſons, and we ſee not but theſe ſame reaſons will hold here.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we add, that generally the Conſciences of the Godly look on this kind of practiſes, although committed in ſleep, with horrour, and no reaſoning or diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting will truly quiet them, till they be humbled before God under them, and yet they uſe not to be ſo troubled in other things that are meerly Ceremonial: How doth <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> complain of this, yea confeſs and lament it, <hi>Confeſſ. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 30. (though elſewhere he accounts it no ſin) yet he crys out of it, and that he thought it a mercy, that he had not done what in ſleep he conſented to act, <hi>reperimus nos non feciſſe, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leamus tamen quoquo modo in nobis factum ſuiſſe,</hi> It grieves him that it should be any way done in him, and he aggreadgeth it thus, that he had not alwayes rejected theſe as ſometimes he had done: And do not the Godly ſometimes in their ſleep make oppoſition to theſe motions? and how often do they in prayer wreſtle againſt this evil, and that (as I conceive) from another apprehenſion of it then ſimply, becauſe of any punishment or affliction that is in it? for many things more afflicting do not ſo effect them; and yet even theſe know the reaſons that are made uſe of againſt the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of it, which maketh me think there is ſomething directly againſt Conſcience and Purity in theſe ſinful actions or motions.</p>
               <p>To conclude, ſure we are this Opinion is not unſuitable to the end of the Law, and that abſolute Purity and Angelical Holineſs God calleth for in it; namely, that not only when we are awake we are to be ſtill with him, but that our ſleep should not break our Communion with him: And certainly it is moſt ſafe for man
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31633:24"/>
to humble himſelf under the ſenſe of his ſinful nature, and the ſad neceſſity of ſinning, both waking and ſleeping, he hath brought on himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that thereby he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſs on himſelf the neceſſity of a Mediator for Righteouſneſs, which are the great ends and uſes of the Law.</p>
               <p>We come now more particurarly to the words which the Lord himſelf ſpok: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the number of theſe Commandments, and general ſcope of them (as hath been ſaid) there is no queſtion: but there be four things we would ſpeak a little to, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clearing of the Text, before we come to ſpeak particularly to the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. The firſt is, whether theſe words, <hi>I am th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. be a part of the firſt Commandment, or a Preface to all the Ten? <hi>Anſw;</hi> We think it is a ground laid down for preſſing and drawing forth our obedience to all the Commandments, yet it hath relation more eſpecially to the firſt Commandment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the negative expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there cleareth, which is, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> that is, no other then <hi>Me:</hi> what <hi>Me?</hi> even <hi>Me the Lord thy God that brought thee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ut of the Land of Egypt:</hi> So then there is a ſpecial relation betwixt this Commandment and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, as including the poſitive part of this negative Commandment, and it doth eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially clear theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is the right object of worship, it is <hi>Jehova, Elohim, the Lord,</hi> that sheweth the Unity of the Divine Eſſence; for ſo <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>hovah,</hi> being a word in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is ordinarely look't on as pointing out this, then <hi>Elo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>im,</hi> which is a word in the plural number, ſpeaketh the plurality of Perſons in the God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>head; ſo that the Lord commanding and requiring obedience, here is one God, and three Perſous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It cleareth what is the right Channel in which our ſervice should run, it is in the Channel of the Covenant, our obedience is to be directed, not to God abſtractly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, but to God as our God, <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> ſaith he, and thy God by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; ſo the expreſſion is, Deut. 28. 58. <hi>That thou m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſt fear this glorious and fearful Name,</hi> THE LORD THY GOD. This maketh our ſervice and worship ſweet and kindly; and without this relation there can be no acceptable ſervice per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſinful man to God; and that relation (that by the Covenant of Works once ſtood betwixt them) being broken, it ſaith it muſt be made up again, which only can be done in Chriſt: and it ſaith alſo, that this relation to God in him, and obedience to the Law, can conſiſt well together.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It cleareth what is the right and great motive of obedience, to wit, the benefit of Redemption, love and thankfulneſs, upon that account, conſtraining to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of theſe duties that are commanded, that they may be done willingly, and in a chearful manner.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may be asked, why the ſecond Commandment, and the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, have reaſons preſſing obedience annexed to them, which none of the other hath, at leaſt expreſly ſet down by the Lord? <hi>Anſw.</hi> This may be a reaſon, becauſe all the other Commandments are by the Law of Nature determined in mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and the ſins againſt them are by Natures Light ſeen to be evil; but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of theſe two, to wit, what way he will be worshipped in externals, and on what day as the ſolemn time of worship, being determined by Gods poſitive Law, they are not ſo impreſſed on mens Conſciences as the duties required in the other Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are; therefore the Lord addeth reaſons to each of theſe to perſwade to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of them, as to the ſecond, <hi>I am a jealous God;</hi> and therefore will not admit of any the leaſt appearance of declining from me, even in externals, and to the fourth, keep the Sabbath day, for I have put a difference betwixt it and other dayes, though before there was none, which is further amplified in the Text: Now by this reaſon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31633:24"/>
(which is alſo given by the School-men) it may appear, that the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning outward worship, according to our way of diſtinguishing them, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> diſtinct from the firſt, which requireth the inward worship due to God: for the firſt Commandment is Moral-Natural, and can never be altered, and has as much impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on a Natural Conſcience as any; and therefore, according to this ground, needed no reaſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It may be obſerved alſo, that ſome Commandments have Promiſes added to them, which others have not; not that any Commandment wants implied incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, but in ſome they are expreſſed, as in the ſecond. <hi>He sheweth mercy to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,</hi> &amp;c. and in the fifth, <hi>That thy days may be long,</hi> &amp;c. The reaſon given why Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are particularly expreſſed in theſe two is, that obedience to theſe two ſeemeth to bring moſt hurt to men, and is moſt contrary to their corrupt wills and affections; it ſeemeth not ſo prejucidial, nor is it ſo obnoxious to the hatred of the World, that men love God, and fear him in their hearts, &amp;c. as it is outwardly to confeſs him before men, and that by adhering cloſe to the true manner of worſhipping him: This maketh men obnoxious to perſecutions, croſſes, loſſes, &amp;c. to be ſeriouſly taken up in the externals of godlineſs, ſometimes bringeth much prejudice with it, and is to many troubleſome, and ſo to be obedient to Superiours, and tender of Inferiour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, is not eaſily condeſcended unto; therefore God to counterbalance the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that accompany the obedience of theſe two Commandments, hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Promiſes to them, the more to incourage and ſtir up to the obedience of them.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing we would take notice of is, that ſome Commandments have threatnings expreſſed in them, which others have not, as the ſecond, and the third, not that any Commandment wanteth implied threatnings, but the reaſon is, becauſe men ordinarily count light of the breach of theſe two Commandments, if they be (as they think) honeſt at the heart, though they be very negligent and careleſs in many outward things; and though in the manner of worship they be very ſlight and perfunctorious, yet if it be to the true God, they think the leſs of it: And ſo alſo men are given to count very light of reverent uſing Gods Holy Name; therefore he hath put a threatning to both theſe Commandments, to make men know he will not ſo eaſily paſs them, as men oft-times imagine; and that all theſe three, reaſons, promiſes, threatnings, are added to the ſecond Commandment, it doth very clearly and convincingly shew of what concernment that Commandment is, and how ready men are to break it, and that there is ſpecial conſideration and regard to be had to it, ſo far is it from being to be attempted to be expunged out of the number,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="commandment">
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Exod. 20. 3.</bibl>
                  <q>Thou shalt have no other Gods before me.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN this firſt Commandment we may conſider theſe two: 1. The thing comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. 2. The qualification of the Command.</p>
               <p>The thing Commanded is negatively ſet down, <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting to the right object of worship, and differencing the true God from all ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Gods; for though there be but one God, yet are there many who are <hi>called Gods,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 8. 4, 5, 6. The qualification added, is in theſe words, <hi>before me,</hi> which tend not only to the aggravation of the ſin here diſcharged, as being done in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and done, as it were, in contempt and deſpite of God who alwayes ſees;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31633:25"/>
but eſpecially to ſhew the extent of the Prohibition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it tyeth up not only from outward Idolatry, but even from that which is inward and ſecret, and that men ſee not, and is known to God only; and ſo this Commandment requireth not only external worſhip, but that which is inward and ſpiritual before God. Hence the ſcope of this firſt Commandment lieth clearly in theſe two things, (wherein it diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from the ſecond) to wit, 1. That it ſheweth who is the right object of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and directeth men thereto. 2. That it regulateth mens internal worſhipping of God, and calleth for that, whereas the ſecond Commandment ſuppoſeth both theſe, and directeth as to the <hi>manner</hi> of worſhipping the true God in externals, and regulateth theſe.</p>
               <p>This Commandment, as all the reſt, hath a poſitive part requiring ſomething, and a negative part prohibiting ſomething: We ſhall, in the firſt place, ſpeak to what is required here, and we take it up in theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And firſt it requireth the right knowledge of God; for there can be no true worſhip given to him, there can be no right thought or conception of him, or faith in him, till he be known: He muſt be known to be one God in Eſſence, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 4. and three Perſons, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. He muſt be known in his Attributes and Eſſential Properties, Jnfiniteneſs, Immenſeneſs, Unchangeableneſs, Eternity, Omnipotence, Omniſcience, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Juſtice, and Faithfulneſs: He muſt alſo be known in his ſpecial works, whereby his Soveraignty and Majeſty appeareth, as his works of Creation, Providence, Redemption, and what concerneth it; as the Covenant of Grace, and its terms; the Mediator, and his Offices: no ſervice or worſhip can be offered to God, nor can we have any ground of Faith in him, without ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of diſtinct knowledge of theſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It requireth from us a ſuitable acknowledging of God in all theſe his Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: As 1. That he be highly eſteemed above all. 2. Loved. 3. Feared. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and truſted in. 5. Hoped in. 6. Adored. 7. Honoured. 8. Served and obeyed. And ſo 9. He muſt be the Supreme end in all our actions, that ſhould mainly be aimed at by us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It requireth ſuch duties as reſult from his Excellency, and our acknowledging him to be ſuch a one: As 1. Dependance upon him. 2. Submiſſion to him, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience under croſs Diſpenſations from him. 3. Faith reſting on him. 4. Prayers put up to him, 5. Repentance for wronging him. 6. Communion, and a conſtant wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with him. 7. Delighting in him, 8. Meditating on him; and ſuch other as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily may be inferred as duties incumbent to Creatures in ſuch a relation to ſuch a God, whoſe Excellency and worth calleth and inviteth men to all ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able duties.</p>
               <p>Next, it is neceſſary that we add ſome Advertiſements to theſe Generals.</p>
               <p>And 1. That the Commandment requireth all theſe, and in the higheſt and moſt perfect degree.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it not only requireth them in our ſelves, but obligeth us to further them in all others, according to our Places and Callings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it requireth the diligent uſe of all means that may help and further us in theſe; as Reading, Meditation, Study, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That theſe things which in ſome reſpect may be given to Creatures, as love, fear, &amp;c. yet when they are required as duties to God, they are required in a far
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31633:25"/>
more eminent way; ſo that Creatures muſt yield and give place when God cometh in competition with them in theſe; and theſe things which are proper to God, as reſting on him, adoring of him, are to be given to no other.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All theſe things are ſo required, as none of them thruſt out another; but that all ſo conſiſt, as every duty may keep its own place, without prejudice to any other.</p>
               <p>In the next place, we would conſider the negative part of this Commandment, for the extent thereof will be beſt diſcerned by conſidering what is forbidden therein, and how it may be broken: It is indeed the Commandment, in reference to which, beyond all the reſt, almoſt the generality of men think themſelves moſt innocent; and yet upon tryal it will be found, that men are moſt guilty of the breach thereof: We may look upon the breach of this Commandment more <hi>largely,</hi> as God is any way wronged in that which is his due; or more <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> as it relateth to that which is more properly Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Being more largely conſidered, it is broken two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When what is proper and Eſſential to God, is denied to him in effect, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically; as when he is not accounted Eternal, Omnipotent, one bleſſed God in three Perſons: And thus men are guilty, either in Opinion or in practiſe, when they walk ſo before God, as if they thought him not Omnipotent, Omniſcient, &amp;c. And ſo <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16. it is ſaid of ſome, <hi>that they profeſs to know God, but in works they deny him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is broken, when any thing unbecoming the Holy Majeſty of God is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto him; as that he changeth, favoureth prophanity, &amp;c. So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50. 21. it is ſaid of ſome prophane men, that they thought him like unto themſelves. Theſe two may be called more general Idolatry; we ſhall ſpeak further to them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third way it is broken (conſidering the breach of this Commandment ſtrictly) is by attributing that which is due to God, and properly belongeth to him, to Creatures; as truſting in them, calling on them by prayer, accounting them Omnipotent, Omniſcent, or believing that they have influence or power to guide the World, which ſome do attribute to Stars, to the Heavens, to Fortune, to Saints, to Angels, yea to Devils, this is properly Idolatry: And becauſe it is the chief ſcope of this Commandment, and we are bidden expreſly to keep our ſelves from Idols, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5. we ſhall inſiſt a little on it.</p>
               <p>And 1. We ſhall premit ſome diſtinctions of Idolatry, 2. Shew how men fall in it. 3. What are the ſpecial Idols men commit Idolatry with. 4. Which are the moſt ſubtil and dangerous Idols. 5. Give ſome rules whereby ye may try this ſin of Idolatry, even when it is moſt ſubtil.</p>
               <p>And 1. Idolatry may be diſtinguiſhed, 1. Into Idolatry againſt the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, when worſhip is not directed to the right, but to the wrong object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Idolatry againſt the ſecond Commandment, which ſtriketh againſt the preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed manner of worſhipping God: We are now to ſpeak to the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This Idolatry is either 1. Doctrinal, or Idolatry in the Judgement, when one profeſſedly believeth ſuch a thing beſide God to have ſome Divinity in it; as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens do of their <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Jupiter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and Papiſts do of their Saints: Or 2. It is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical, when men believe no ſuch thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will not own any ſuch Opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet on the matter they are guilty of the ſame thing as covetous men, &amp;c. The firſt taketh
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31633:26"/>
in all Heathens, Turks, Hereticks, that by their Doctrines and Opinions wrong the true God, or his worship: The ſecond taketh in all ſelf-ſeeking, ambitious, covetous, and voluptuous perſons, &amp;c. who fall in with the former in their practiſe, though not in Opinion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may be diſtinguished into Idolatry that hath ſomething for its object, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> worshipped Beaſts, and the <hi>Perſians</hi> the Sun or Fire, and that which has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but mens imaginations for its object, as theſe who worship feigned Gods; in which reſpect the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>an Idol is nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We would diſtinguish betwixt the objects of Idolatry, and they are either ſuch as are in themſelves ſimply ſinful, as Devils, prophane men, or they are ſuch as are good in themſelves, but abuſed and wronged when they are made objects of Idolatry, as Angels, Saints, Sun, Moon, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Diſtinguiſh betwixt Idolatry that is more groſs and profeſſed, and that which is more latent, ſubtil, and denied: This diſtinction is like that before mentioned into Opinion and practiſe, and much coincideth with it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Diſtinguish betwixt Heart-Idolatry, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 11. 12. and 16 2, 3. and external Idolatry, the former conſiſteth in an inward heart-reſpect to ſome Idol, as this tumultuous people were inſlaved to their caſe and bellies in the laſt two fore-cited places; the other in ſome external Idolatrous geſture or action.</p>
               <p>In practical Idolatry we are to diſtinguish betwixt the letting out of our affections upon ſimply ſinful objects, and the letting them out exceſſively upon lawful objects. Thus men are guilty of Idolatry with ſinful objects, when they love and covet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Houſe, Wife, or Goods, when things unlawful and forbidden have the heart. Again, men are guilty of Idolatry in making lawful objects Idols; as when by exceſs or inordinateneſs of love to their own Means, Wife, Houſe, &amp;c. they put them in Gods room, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did with <hi>Babylon, Dan.</hi> 4. 30. So then, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſenſe, men make their luſts or ſins. whatever they be, their Idols, Gluttons that ſerve their appetite, Drunkards their drunkenneſs, make their Bellies and Appetite their Idol; for to whatever men <hi>yield themſelves to obey, they are ſervants unto that which they obey,</hi> Rom. 6. 16. An Idol is ſomething exceſſively eſteemed of, and Idolatry is the transferring of Gods due, outwardly or inwardly, to what is not God, whether we eſteem it God or not.</p>
               <p>We shall firſt ſpeak of practical Heart-Idolatry, eſpecially when lawful things are made Idols, which is the moſt ſubtil kind of Idolatry, and that which men moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily fall into: And it may be cleared theſe five wayes, by all which, men give that which is due to God unto Creatures. There are five things that are incontrovertibly due to God, to wit, 1. Eſtimation and honour above all. 2. Love with all the heart. 3. Confidence and truſt. 4. Fear and reverence. 5. Service and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>Firſt then men commit Idolatry, when any thing, even any lawful thing, getteth too much <hi>reſpect</hi> from them; ſo that their happineſs is placed in it, and they can leſs abide to want it in effect, whatever they may ſay in words, then Communion with God himſelf: When men have ſuch an exceſſive eſteem of Wife, Children, Houſes, Lands, great Places, &amp;c. and when they are taken from them, they cry as <hi>Micah,</hi> Judge 18. 24. <hi>Ye have taken away my Gods from me, and what have I more?</hi> When all the other contentments a man hath, yea all the Promiſes, and God himſelf alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proveth but of little value to him, in reſpect of ſome particular he is deprived of by ſome croſs Deſpenſation; it is a token it had too much of his heart: Try this by two things. 1. When any beloved thing is threatned to be removed, it then appeareth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31633:26"/>
how it is affected, and ſtuck unto. 2. What is made uſe of to make up that; ſee a notable difference betwixt <hi>David</hi> and his men, or moſt of them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6. when he wanted aſmuch as they, they know no way to make it up, therefore they think of ſtoning him, but he incourageth himſelf <hi>in the Lord his God:</hi> they had no more left at all, its like, he hath his God abiding, in whom he may yet be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way whereby men commit Idolatry with Creatures, is in their love which is due to God with all the heart; but men ordinarily give away their hearts to Creatures, in being addicted to them in their deſires, ſeeking exceſſively after them, in their doating on them, or ſorrowing immoderately for want of them. Hence the covetous man who loveth the world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 15. is called an Idolater, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 5. Thus it diſcovered it ſelf in <hi>Achab,</hi> who ſo loved <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, that he could not reſt without it: So <hi>Demas</hi> idolized the World, when for love of it, he forſook his ſervice with the Apoſtle (though it had been but for a time) 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. Mens love to Creatures is exceſſive. 1. When their contentment ſo dependeth upon them, as they fret when they cannot come at the enjoyment of them, as we may ſee in <hi>Achab,</hi> when he cannot get <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, and in <hi>Rachel</hi> for want of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. 2. When it ſtands in competition with God, and duty to him is shufled out from reſpect and love to the World, or any thing in it, as we ſee in <hi>Demas,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. 3. Though duty be not altogether thruſt out, yet when love to theſe things marreth us in that zealous way of performing duty to God, as it did in <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 24. who is ſaid to honour and love his Children above God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. not that he forbore them altogether, but becauſe his sharpneſs was not ſuch as it should have been, and (as it is like) it would have been, had not they been his own Sons whom he too much loved; whereas to the contrary it is ſpoken to <hi>Abrahams</hi> commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that he loved God, becauſe he with-held not his only Son when God called for him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is, when <hi>confidence and truſt</hi> is placed in any thing beſide God, (to wit, exceſſively, as before we ſaid of love.) Thus when a mans protection is placed in men, though Princes, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 146. 3. or in Multitudes, or in Horſes and Armies, it is idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of them. Thus rich men may make (as it is <hi>Joh</hi> 31, 24. <hi>gold their confidence, and fine gold their hope;</hi> that is, when men account themſelves ſecure, not becauſe God hath a Providence, but becauſe they have ſuch means; as <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a</hi> truſted to the Phyſicians, and not to God; namely, in that particular, the cure of his diſeaſe; or as the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 19. who founded his taking reſt to his Soul on his full Barns, and ſo ſome truſt their ſtanding to ſuch a great Man who is their Friend: And this is known; 1. By the means to which men betake them in a ſtrait, as when they ſtand not to make uſe of ſinful means. 2. By what noiſe they make when they are diſappointed. 3. It is known by this, when their leaning on ſuch a Creature marreth their reſting on God, and on his Providence. Hence it is hard for men to be rich, and not to place their confidence in riches; and ſo Chriſt ſpeaketh of the difficulty of rich mens being ſaved. 4. Then men truſt in their riches, when the having of them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them to think themſelves the more ſecure, and maketh them proud and jolly, as if they added ſome worth to thoſe who poſſeſs them, which could not be, if they were not ſomething too much thought of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth way how Creatures are idolized by men, is in their <hi>fear,</hi> when men or events are feared more then God, and fear maketh men ſin, or at leaſt keepeth them back from duty, in leſs or more like thoſe Profeſſors, who for fear of the Jews <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 42.) did not confeſs Chriſt. Thus men may idolize their very
<pb facs="tcp:31633:27"/>
Enemies whom they hate, when they fear more him that can kill the body, then him that can deſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oy both ſoul and body. Thus great men and powerful in the World are often idolized, and good and well-qualified men may be made Idols alſo, when men become ſo addicted and devoted to them, as to call them <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and to be (as it were) ſworn to their words and Opinions (as the Sectaries in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> were, and ſuch at all times, for the moſt part, are to their Leaders) when it is not the matter or reaſon that ſwayeth, but the perſon that teacheth ſuch Doctrine, or holdeth ſuch an Opinion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth way of committing this Idolatry is by <hi>ſervice,</hi> when a man is brought under the power of any thing; ſo whatever a man ſerveth this way is an Idol, every predominant, every perſon or humour that a man ſetteth himſelf thus to pleaſe is an Idol: in this reſpect it is ſaid men cannot ſerve two Maſters, <hi>God and Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mon;</hi> and if we yet <hi>ſerve</hi> men, we are not the <hi>Servants of Christ, Gal.</hi> 1. 10. This may be known, 1. By what men are moſt exceſſively taken up with, and moſt careful to fullfil and accompliſh. 2. By looking to what it is for which they will take moſt pains that they may attain it. 3. By what getteth moſt of their time and labour. 4. By what overſwayeth, and overcometh, or overaweth them moſt, ſo that they cannot reſiſt it, though it thruſt by duties to God; and when they are ne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ver ſo taken up with <hi>Gods ſervice,</hi> but it indiſpoſeth them when ever they come to immediate worſhip; it is an evident token that ſuch a thing is the mans <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dol.</p>
               <p>Theſe be the moſt ordinary wayes how men fall in this ſin of Idolatry: it were hard to ſpeak of all the ſeveral Idols which may be loved, feared, reſted on too much, and ſo put in Gods room: I ſhall inſtance in a few.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the World; this is the great Clay-Idol that both covetous and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous men hunt after, crying, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good? Pſalm</hi> 4. 6. By this thouſands are kept in bondage, and turned head long: An exceſſive deſire to have the World's Goods, and to have by theſe a name in the Earth, is many a mans Idol.</p>
               <p>A ſecond is the Belly, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 19. a ſhameful God, yet worſhipped by the moſt part of men, who travel for no more but for a portion in this life to fill the Belly, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 17. 14. to win their living, and provide for their Families. To this ſort alſo belongeth Gluttons, Drunkards, Palate-pleaſers, (who are look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> upon as the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men in the World, abounding alace in our dayes) being according to Satans Maxime, ready <hi>to give skin for skin, and all they have for their life;</hi> and aiming at no more, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 4. Thus Satan thought to have found out <hi>Job</hi> when his riches were quite gone; thus he tempted the Lord Chriſt to provide Bread in an anxious way; and thus fear of want captivateth many.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third great Idol (which is comprehenſive ſome way of all) is a mans life, his Honour, Credit, Reputation, good Name, and Applauſe in the World; his own Will, Opinion, Tenets, Judgements, whereof men are moſt tenacious, and will not quite ſometimes (as the Proverb is) <hi>an inch of their will for a ſpan of their thrift.</hi> Thus men are ſaid <hi>to live to themſelves,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. in oppoſition to living unto God, when ſelf-reſpect ſwayeth them to be <hi>lovers of themſelves,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Tim. 3. verſ. 2. 4. <hi>and lovers of their pleaſures more then God, and ſelf-wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Pet. 2. 10. Ah, who are free of this!</p>
               <p>The fourth is Men of Parts, &amp;c. who have done or may do ſome conſiderable good
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31633:27"/>
or evil to one, or have ſomething in them eminent beyond others: Theſe oft-times, in regard of the fear, love, or truſt, men place in them, are made great Idols.</p>
               <p>The fifth is Lawful Contentments, as Houſes, Wives, Children, unto which men are often too much addicted, and with which they are often too much taken up, even ſometimes with that which is in it ſelf very little, and ſo they prove their Idols.</p>
               <p>A ſixth is <hi>Self-righteouſneſs,</hi> mens prayers, their repentance, blameleſs, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, &amp;c. theſe may get, and often get more of their confidence, and weight of their Eternal Peace, then they ſhould: So the Jews laid the great ſtreſs and weight of their Salvation upon this Idol, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh may be outward Ordinances in purity, external forms, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Religion, when men reſt upon theſe, and preſs not after the Power; as the Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who cryed up the Temple of the Lord, the Covenant betwixt him and them, and their external relation to him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 4. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The eighth is any gift of God which he hath beſtowed on men, ſuch as Beauty, Strength, Wit, Learning, when men who have them lay too much weight on them, or think too much of them; yea, Grace it ſelf, the ſenſe of Gods love, and inward peace, may be put in Chriſts room, and more ſought for ſometimes then Chriſt himſelf: Now when theſe are reſted on, delighted in, and he ſlighted, or when they are miſſed, and he not delighted in, then they are Idols.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Eaſe, quietneſs, and a mans own contentment, is oft-times a great Idol; and it is ſo when a man is ſo addicted to his eaſe, as he cannot abide to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, Thus was it with that man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 19. <hi>Soul take thee reſt:</hi> His Eaſe was his Idol, and he reſted on it, and made it the end of all his buildings, and laying up of goods; but his riches were his Idol, as he grounded his expectation of reſt upon that which he poſſeſſed: So many idle men who frame their life ſo as they may not be troubled, though they be no wayes profitable, but ſpend what they have, making this the drift of all they do, that they may have an eaſie life, when this overſwayeth them as their laſt end, (though otherwiſe, if they were not wedded to their caſe, might be more profitable) and often with abſtaining from, and neglecting of many neceſſary duties, that they may eſchew trouble, it is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Idol.</p>
               <p>A tenth is wandering fancies and <hi>Chimera's,</hi> the mind pleaſing it ſelf with them, and delighting to entertain them, and purſuing them from a deſign to find ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in them, even in ſuch things as never had, nor it may be, can have a being, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in their own imagination and fancy; ſuch are called by <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>The wanderings of the deſire</hi> (oppoſed to the <hi>ſight of the eyes,</hi> which others delight in) as when men ſpend their wits and inventions on penning Romances, Love-paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Stage-playes, Comedies, Masks, Balls, &amp;c. or which is more ſubtil, yet much practiſed, when the minds of men frame imaginary and fictitious revenge, delight, eminency, &amp;c. to themſelves.</p>
               <p>The means and ſecond cauſes, Phyſitians, Armies, Miniſters, Stars, and Natural Cauſes, by which God uſeth to work (by ſome called <hi>Nature)</hi> are oft-times ſo tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and leaned to, as they are made mens Idols, nay by many in theſe dayes, Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary Aſtrology, Palmeſtry, &amp;c. are much ſtudied and doted on, and the Scriptures antiquated and laid aſide in a great meaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:31633:28"/>
Next, if it be asked, what Idols are moſt ſubtil? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. An Idol is then moſt ſubtil, when it lurketh in the heart, and ſcateth it ſelf principally in mens mind, aim, and inward contentment, and they inwardly aſcribe too much to ſuch a thing, and yet, it may be, in their external practiſe, there is not much to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then are Idols moſt ſubtil, when they lye in ſuch things to which ſomewhat of fear, love, delight, &amp;c. is allowable, as in lawful things, which may in ſome meaſure be lawfully loved, feared, and ſought for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When they are in negatives, as in Omiſſions, Eaſe, &amp;c. then they are more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til then when they lye in ſomething men poſitively ſeek after, or in the Commiſſion of ſomething forbidden.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When they paſs under a lawful name, as when Pride goeth under the name of Honeſty, Anxiety under the name of Lawful Care, &amp;c. then they are hardly diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When ſticking to one Idol, the man rejecteth all others, (as he conceiveth) out of reſpect to God, as may be inſtanced in the caſes of a Monaſtick li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, regular obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſome ſingular opinion ſo much ſtuck to, and laid weight on by many.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When it is in means that have been uſed, or are allowed by God for attaining ſuch an end; as it is hard to keep bounds in this caſe, ſo it is hard to diſcover the Idolatry of the heart in it.</p>
               <p>In all which it is to be advertiſed, that Idolatry in theſe things conſiſteth moſtly in the inordinateneſs of the heart, and affections to them, and that it lyeth not ſo much in our actions about them, as in the manner of our acting, and the circumſtances accompanying us and our actions, anxiety, eſtimation, exceſſive care, love, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For clearing the difference betwixt this idolatrous love, fear, ſervice, and true love, fear, &amp;c. take theſe Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When our love to Creatures drowneth our love to God, and maketh us to caſt off duties we owe to him, as in <hi>Demas.</hi> 2. When in part it marreth us in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of duties to God, as in <hi>Eli.</hi> 3. When it ſo taketh us up in our practiſe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the day, that we give not neceſſary time to the Worship of God, in praying, reading, hearing, &amp;c. 4. When it indiſpoſeth for theſe; ſo that when we are praying or hearing, the heart is carried away after Creatures, and the mind is taken up with ſome other thing then God, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 33. 31. 5. When they too much, and very unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily haunt the heart in meditation, or when we lye down or riſe, and at ſuch times when our thinking on ſuch imployments contributeth not to the furtherance of them, it sheweth that they have too much of the heart when they poſſeſs it alwayes, and when it is ſeldom taken up actually with better things, but theſe ſteal in eaſily and at all times.</p>
               <p>It may appear now 1. How common this ſin of Idolatry is. 2. How great guilt and hazard men are lying under thereby, becauſe 1. Few are convinced of it. 2. Many years Idolatry lyeth together upon the Conſciences of many. 3. There is little repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for it, though many ways one may inſenſibly ſlide into it.</p>
               <p>It is not ſo very uſeful or needful here particularly to enquire what Idol is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and hath chief room, if theſe three things be granted. 1. That there may be, and are many Idols often at once, as Legions diſtracting the man, and ſwarming in his heart. 2. That ſucceſſively they may be changed, according to mens tentations and conditions. 3. That men should ſtudy the mortification of all, and the giving God his due, ſo as none be ſpared; for if any one be ſpared, none at all are mortified &amp; ſlain.</p>

It would become Believers, and it would be their advantage, to think much upon ſuch Scriptures as theſe, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 30. 22. <hi>And ye shall be my People, and I will he your God.</hi> Luke 14. 8. <hi>VVhen thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, ſit not down in the higheſt room; l ſt a more honourable man then thou be bidden of him.</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. to <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. And that they would ſtudy conformity to them, and learn to abhor Idols; yea, all Creatures in ſo far as they become Idols to them.</p>
               <p>We are now further to proſecute the Branches of this Commandment, which is a Key to all the reſt; and becauſe Gods Soveraignity is holden forth here, there is no ſin that may not be reduced to it, as being a diſobedience to this Soveraign God: We shall firſt permit ſome general wayes whereby it is broken, then inſiſt in ſome particulars.</p>
               <p>More generally it is broken three wayes, as hath been ſaid already.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By derogating from God that which is his due; ſo all contempt of him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to him, wronging his infinite Attributes, as if he were not Omnipotent, Omniſcient, Infinite, &amp;c. denying of his Providence in leſs or more, are breaches of this Commandment. Thus he is wronged, when he getteth not everyway that which is his due.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By attributing to God what is not conſiſtent with his abſolute Perfection, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Holineſs, as that he doth or can do wrong, change, not keep his Promiſes, or not guide the World wiſely; that he hath any bodily shape, or may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When what is due to God, as Faith, Hope, Love, Fear, &amp;c. is given to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whether to Idols litterally, or to Men, to Saints, Angels, Ordinances, (as the Sacraments) Stars, Herbs, Gold, Phyſicians, &amp;c. when too much weight is laid on them, or any thing not agreeing to them is aſcribed to them, by which Witchcraft, Charming, Covetouſneſs, Judicial Aſtrology, &amp;c. are reproved, as drawing the hearts of men away from the living God.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, May not ſome things in the World be loved, and may not ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence be placed in men, means, &amp;c. I anſwer, Love may be given to ſome things, and naturally is called for to ſome things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but 1. Not ſimply, but with ſubordination to God; not for themſelves, but out of obedience to God; and as they may be uſefull to us in helping us to honour him, and as they are his gifts. 2. We are not exceſſively to love or reſt on theſe, but ſo, as from love to God, we be ready to quit, yea, to hate them, as Chriſt ſpeaketh of Father and Mother, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. Again, there may be ſome kind of confidence given to ſome things, but 1. Not ſimply, nor 2. For them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. 3. Nor alwayes. 4. Nor in all things; but 1. This confidence muſt be ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to Gods appointment. 2. It muſt be with dependance on his bleſſing for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king means effectual, and ſo may we expect health from Meat, Drink, Phyſick, &amp;c. for they are looked on as means conducing to ſuch an end, and yet it is the Lord alone that muſt be reſted on. 3. There may be comparative confidence, whereby men lean more to one mean then to another, as more to a skillful Phyſician then to an unskill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and more to an Army, as to overcoming an Enemy, then when it is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, becauſe that confidence is in ſome external thing, and concerneth not Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and but compareth means amongſt themſelves, as they are ordinarily made uſe of by God for attaining theſe ends; but in this caſe the means are not ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in.</p>
               <p>Next, we are to conſider that this Command may be broken all theſe ways, in four reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:31633:29"/>
1. In Doctrine; as when men maintain ſuch things as diſhonour God, or give his due to Creatures, and do teach them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5 33. to 38.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Opinion or Judgement; as ſuppoſe men ſhould not vent and publiſh ſuch things, yet if they in their heart think or believe ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though it come not to a ſetled judgement, but only reacheth the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſo that looſe unbecoming thought of God, or miſapprehenſions derogatory to him are entertained, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 29.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In practiſe, when men live as if there were no God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. <hi>v.</hi> 1. as if he were not omniſcient, juſt, &amp;c. theſe do indeed deny him, whatever be their profeſſion to the contrary, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16. Thus all propane men, who live looſly, are guilty; as alſo formal Hypocrites who reſt on the out-ſide of duties.</p>
               <p>Therefore, in the third place, we are to conſider, that this Commandment, in the extent thereof, doth condemn 1. All groſs Idolaters of any ſort, who uſually are mentioned under the name of Heathens, 2. Jews, who worſhip not the true God in his Son Jeſus Chriſt. 3. All Hereticks, that deny the Godhead of any of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; as <hi>Sabellians,</hi> who make but one Perſon; <hi>Arrians,</hi> who make Chriſt a Made-God; <hi>Photinians,</hi> who make him a pure Man; and all that make a plurality of Gods, or that leſſen the Divine Attributes, and give to Saints Gods due, in Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Invocation; or, in a word, whoever contradict any Truth, or maintain any Errour; for thereby they faſten it upon God and his Word, and wrong him who owneth no ſuch thing: And to theſe may be added all ignorant perſons who know not God. 4. All prophane men, whether Atheiſts in heart or in practiſe, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient perſons indeed denying God, and not giving him his due, which is obedience, whatever in words they profeſs concerning him. 5. All Hypocrites, who give him but an an outſide ſervice, and ſo are not in their obedience ſinćere and perfect as before him. 6. All Compacters with the Devil, who conſult him, or who leave Gods way, and ſeek to come to the knowledge of any thing by an unlawful way; which is 1. To meddle with Gods Secrets when he has not revealed them. 2. It is to be beholden to Gods Enemy, the Devil, for revealing ſuch things. 3. It is a making uſe of an unwarrantable mean, which has no bleſſing Promiſed to it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be uſed as a mean with ſubordination to God, even though the matter enquired after by ſuch means, or by the Devil, be ſuch as he may know. 7. All charming by words, herbs, or ſuch means as God hath not appointed for that end, or which have no Natural and Phyſical Efficacy for bringing it forth; as in ſeeking health from Witches, when there muſt be words ſo often repeated, or they muſt be ſaid faſting, or going backward, &amp;c. all laying weight on theſe, or the like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, without any reaſon. 8. All Spells, fearing of events, and uſing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious means to prevent theſe, as laying bits of Timber at doors, carrying a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meerly for a Charm, without uſing it, eſteeming dayes and times unlucky and unfortunate: theſe draw men off from God to ſome other thing: Of this ſort is all Divining by Lots, Stars, Rods, or any other way, not having a Warrant, to find out ſome ſecret, or to know ſomething that is to come; (it being Gods Property and Prerogative to declare what is to come, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 41.) for when there is no Efficacy, no Reaſon in the mean uſed, the Effect muſt be looked for, either from God, or from the Devil: Now when God has neither put it naturally in the mean, nor by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will any way warranted it, as ſometimes he doth, (as when he appointed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31633:29"/>
Waſhing in <hi>Jordan</hi> for curing <hi>Naamans</hi> Leproſie, and Anointing in the Primitive times for healing the Sick) it cannot be from him. Hence ſometimes one Charm or word to one at one time, will do what it never doth to another: Theſe means have alway ſome circumſtance in word or action immediately and explicitly, or implicitly flowing from the Devil, which may be good in it ſelf, yet has no force for the end, and ſo draweth men to own the Devils Inſtitution, which is exceeding derogatory to the honour of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We gather the breaches of this Commandment from the duties that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in it, ſuch as Faith, Love, Obedience, Hope, Fear, Knowledge, &amp;c. in which we may fail theſe ways in the general. 1. When we want theſe Graces, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not theſe duties required. 2. When they are counterfeited, and not real; as when our humility is not real, our prayers not ſincere, but in ſhew only. 3. When they are defective, as to the meaſure of Knowledge, Faith, &amp;c. which we ſhould be at. 4. When they degenarate, as when knowledge turneth into Curioſity, and Faith into Preſumption, and Hope into vain Confidence, Fear into Unbelief and Anxiety, by which we may ſee how often this Commandment is broken.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we may the better underſtand the breaches of this Commandment, we would firſt take a view of Gods Excellency and Attributes, and ſee how we ſin againſt all theſe, for we ſhould walk worthy of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 10, And here ye may obſerve, that his infinite Wiſdom is wronged by not ſubmitting to him, or not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king direction from him, his Power by not imploying him, his Grace by not truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, or abuſing it to wantonneſs, his Omniſcience by wiſhing he ſaw not not ſome things, hiding them from men, and not fearing him, counterfeiting in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, &amp;c. ſo is his Juſtice wronged by expecting mercy without making uſe of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, not fearing his threatnings, not ſcaring at ſin, but hazarding on his wrath: and the like may be inſtanced in all the reſt of his Attributes, which are all ſinned againſt, either by ignorance, or by omiſſion of ſomething they call for, or by the Commiſſion of ſomething unbecoming them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider God in his relations to us, how often is he ſinned againſt as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? how is his kindneſs abuſed, and he not reverenced as Creator of whom we have our Being? yea, he is kicked againſt, and we live not to him from whom and by whom we live; he is a Husband, and yet we go a whoring from him, and prove unfaithful in all our tyes to him; he is a Redeemer of his People, and a Maſter and Lord of all, but what fear, love, ſubjection getteth he from us, notwithſtanding of all theſe Relations?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider Gods works for us, about us, and to us, of Creation, Providence, and Redemption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſides his particular Diſpenſations both of Mercies and Judgments, all which call for ſomething ſuitable from us; and yet every one of them is more ways then one ſlighted, by attributing whether good or evil, to Chance, Luck, or Fortune, by unthankfulneſs to him, and abuſe of what he giveth; and by not ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe works, ſo as to admire and love him who is the Worker.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider our obligation to God in all the parts of our Covenant with him, ſealed by Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper: Sure we ſhould ſtudy to be like all theſe Covenant-relations, and to anſwer theſe Obligations; but alace, how ſhamefully unanſwerable are we to them all?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider his Will revealed in his Word, and ſee how far ſhort we are in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:31633:30"/>
Laſtly, conſider what care there is of uſing the means that may bring us near to, and abſtaining from thoſe things that draw us away from God, ſuch as ſinful Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracies, evil Company, light and unſound Books, travelling needleſly to ſtrange pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c. all which, and whatever elſe taketh the heart off God, are breaches of this Commandment.</p>
               <p>Next, we ſhall inſiſt more particularly upon ſome manifeſt breaches oppoſite to the great and principal ſcope of this Commandment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is <hi>Ignorance,</hi> which is a direct breach; for the Commandment requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth us to know him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8, 9. and if he be not known, there is no other duty can be rightly performed, the knowledge of God being the ground of all duties.</p>
               <p>For clearing of it, conſider that ſome things concerning God are kept up from us, other things are revealed to us; theſe things which are kept up from us we cannot know: And 1. They are either ſuch as we cannot ſee now, becauſe they are, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible in themſelves, as Gods infinite Nature and Attributes, which as they are in themſelves, cannot be comprehenſibly conceived, no not in Heaven; but while we are upon earth, we ſee but darkly, as through a glaſs, and our knowledge of him is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith then ſight; or they are ſuch things which are conceiveable, but God has not thought good to reveal them unto men; as when he will end the World, when he will take every man from this life, who are particularly Elected, &amp;c. to be ignorant of theſe is no ſin, it is a duty not to ſeek to know them, yea curioſity in theſe is ſinful; Ignorance here is called rather a Neſcience then Ignorance, which implieth a privation of knowledge which men ought to have; or 2. Theſe things concerning God are ſuch as not onely in themſelves may be known, but ſuch as we ought to know, becauſe they are revealed to us; ignorance of theſe is ſinful: As 1. Being a diſconformity to that knowledge and holineſs after which God created us. 2. A fruit of original ſin. 3. A cauſe of many ſins. 4. A diſconformity to the Law, which requireth us ſo to know and acknowledge God as he has revealed himſelf to us; and that in his Eſſence, in the Trinity of Perſons, in his Attributes, Covenants, works of Creation and Redemption, and in his Relations to us; and that we should ſo know him, that we may thereby know our ſelves alſo: And this is that great duty called for in this Commandment, that we may know him, and his will.</p>
               <p>Again, this ignorance, as to theſe things, we ought to know, may be looked on as threefold, according to the diverſity of its cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a natural ignorance, that is the fruit of our natural corruption and blindneſs, which hath ſeized on mens memories and judgements, and, as they think, incapacitateth them to learn, and indeed doth ſo, as to the ſpiritual and ſaving up-taking of the matters of God, till the eyes of the mind be opened by the power of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a willful ignorance, when men have parts, means, and occaſions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may attain knowledge, and yet they will not know, but ſlight and deſpiſe the means which draweth often a judicial blindneſs along with it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a lazy ignorance, whereby ſome do not wilfully reject the means of knowledge, yet are ſo negligent, that they do not actually ſtir themſelves for attaining of knowledge: Now though there be a difference among theſe, yet the leaſt of them is ſinfull, and will not wholly excuſe, it being a fruit of original ſin (at the beſt) enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by our own neglect of ſuch means as might have more removed it: And thus a dull wit, or weak memory, can no more ſimply excuſe, then other groſs diſcomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31633:30"/>
to the Law in our natures (appearing in ſome more then others) which follow upon original ſin.</p>
               <p>In ſum, men may be three wayes guilty of the breach of this Law, in reſpect of ignorance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the object matter whereof they are ignorant, which may be leſs or more, according as leſs or more of that is known, which we should know concerning God, and which he hath revealed; and this is eſpecially to be underſtood of the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial things more neceſſary to be known, there being a great difference betwixt theſe, and other things, which do not ſo immediately concern God; ſuch as Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologick Queſtions, ſome Prophecies, Caſes, &amp;c. which yet are recorded in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They may be guilty of leſs or more ignorance, in reſpect of the degree; ſo ſome men are abſolutely ignorant, others are doubtful only, and not confirmed in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truths of God, who yet have not contrary impreſſions of theſe things, as others have.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are divers kinds of ignorance in men, ſome are guilty of wilful ignorance, ſome are negligent, and ſome (even the beſt) are labouring under the remainder of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural blindneſs, who yet are not negligent.</p>
               <p>If it be asked whether ignorance can excuſe a man, and how far it excuſeth. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. There is no ignorance (properly ſo called) that excuſeth <hi>wholly, pro toto,</hi> it being of it ſelf ſinful, and men being obliged to know what is ſin, and what not; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can ever men do that out of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they do in ignorance, and know not if it be in it ſelf ſinful or lawful: this is to be underſtood in reſpect of <hi>ignorantia Juris, non facti,</hi> of the ignorance of the <hi>Law,</hi> and not of the ignorance of the <hi>Fact,</hi> (as they call it;) for men may ſometimes be ignorant of this, and yet be Innocent; as when one is cutting with an Axe, and it falleth off the Helve, &amp;c. but in reſpect of the Law, there is no invinciable ignorance that can excuſe any for their not knowing Gods mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are obliged to know it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ignorance that is wilfully entertained with neglect of means that might help it, is ſo far from excuſing, that it doth aggravate the faults occaſioned thereby, becauſe in that caſe there are two faults that concur. 1. Ignorance. 2. Another ſin produced thereby.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Ignorance natural, or proceeding from paucity of means, or leſs occaſion to learn, though it doth not fully, yet in part excuſeth: Hence it is ſaid, they that <hi>know not</hi> the Maſters will, shall be beaten with few ſtripes; but <hi>Corazin,</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> and other places, having plenty of means, shall not in the leaſt be sheltered under that excuſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In ſome things we would diſtinguish betwixt ſinning <hi>ex ignorantia</hi> out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſinning <hi>ignoranter</hi> ignorantly; one may do a thing out of ignorance (as <hi>Paul</hi> perſecuted the Church) that would not have done it had he known it; it was not malice but ignorance that led <hi>Paul</hi> to that ſin of perſecuting, this excuſeth in part; but to do a thing ignorantly, is when a man is more immediately the cauſe of his own ignorance, as when by drunkenneſs, paſſion, hatred, malice, &amp;c. a man is ſo blinded and prejudiced, that he cannot diſcern what is duty, and what is ſin: So ſome of the <hi>Phariſee</hi> were, who might have ſeen that Chriſt was God, and to be acknowledged as ſuch, but prejudice marred it. Thus a ſin conſidered in it ſelf may be leſs, which being conſidered more compleatly, will be found a far greater guilt; as ſuppoſe one in drunkenneſs ſwear, commit Adultery, or in paſſion commit Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Murder or Adultery conſidered in themſelves, as done in drunkenneſs,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31633:31"/>
or paſſion, are leſs, then when done in ſoberneſs; or deliberately; yet theſe ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> being compleatly conſidered, the perſon is more guilty, becauſe he hath Murder and Drunkenneſs, or Murder and Paſſion, both to anſwer for, which Drunkenneſs or Paſſion he cauſed to himſelf by his unwatchfulneſs, and all the effects that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon theſe are to be imputed to him, both as the actor and procurer of that which is the occaſion, or rather the cauſe of them. Thus ye ſee how many wayes ignorance breaketh this Commandment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſhall inſtance the breach of it in what is oppoſite to Faith, or Confidence which floweth from Faith; to wit, unbelief, diffidence, temerity, or tempting of God (which floweth from unbelief, and is oppoſite to Faith) the infidelity of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Jews, and the Atheiſm of ſuch as believe not the Word: Thus alſo Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks who abuſe it, and Apoſtates who fall from the truth thereof, and are oppoſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of it, are guilty of this ſin; as alſo thoſe who receive the Word in vain, and for all his invitations reſt not on him; theſe make God a Lyar, and deſpiſe him and his offers, being unwilling that he ſhould reign over them: Here cometh in alſo anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in reſpect of his Providence, and diſtruſt or diffidence, in reſpect of his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which is a ſin queſtioning the fulfilling of Promiſes from the apprehenſion of ſome weakneſs in the Promiſer, or in means uſed by him to bring about the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment. Temerity, or tempting of God, is againſt Confidence alſo; this is an eſſaying or attempting ſomewhat without Gods Warrant, without which none can lawfully undertake any thing; that of Diffidence wrongeth Gods Faithfulneſs, this of Temerity wrongeth his Wiſdom, in not making uſe of the means preſcribed by him, as if we would attain the end another way of our own; oppoſite to Faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and the profeſſion of it, are diſſembling of the truth, fainting in the profeſſion thereof, eſpecially in the caſe of Confeſſion, by which we diſhonour God, and by our fearful, puſillanimous, and cowardly carriage, ſome way tempt others to think that we do not indeed believe theſe things, on which we ſeem by our faint deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to lay little or no weight.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may inſtance the breach of this Commandment in what is oppoſite to Hope; namely, Deſperation and Preſumption, or vain Confidence; and becauſe every Grace has many oppoſite Vices, ye may ſee it is the eaſier to fail in obedience to this Commandment: Deſperation wrongeth many Graces; it is twofold, either total from want of Faith, or partial from weakneſs of Faith: There is alſo a Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Diffidence that is good, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 20. which is when we deſpair in our ſelves, or from any thing in our ſelves or in the World to attain happineſs, or what is promiſed; that holy Self-deſpair is good, but that is not it which is meaned here, for it is not abſolute deſpairing, but ſuch as hath ſtill a reſervation with it. <hi>If he help me not,</hi> which implieth hope. Preſumption runneth on the other extreme, looking for what is promiſed, without taking Gods way to attain it, and it differeth from native and true Confidence, which with peace and boldneſs reſteth on his Word, and in his way expecteth the thing promiſed; the fault of Preſumption is not that it accounteth Gods mercy too great, or expecteth too much from him, but that it accounteth him to have no Juſtice, nor hath it reſpect to his Holineſs and Greatneſs; even as Deſperation faileth not in attributing to him too much Juſtice, but in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it inconſiſtent with his Mercy and Promiſes, and extending ſin, wants, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs beyond his mercy and help, as <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:31633:31"/>
4. For finding out of the breaches of this Commandment, ye may conſider the oppoſites to love with the whole heart, ſuch as luke-warmneſs, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 15. cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of love, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12. ſelf-love, exceſſive love to Creatures, hatred of God, not as he is good, but as he is averſe from ſinful men, prohibiting what they love, and puniſhing them for committing ſin; for it is impoſſible for men to ſerve two Maſters, as Sin and God, but the one muſt be loved, and the other hated: And is there any thing more ordinary then love to ſin which is evil, and hatred of God which is the great Good? which appeareth in little zeal for him, and little reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider what is oppoſite to Fear and Reverence, and there you will find much carnal ſecurity and vain confidence in it, obſtinacy, ſtout-heartedneſs, little trembling at his Word, not being affected with his Judgments, raſhneſs and irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in his Service, whereas there is a general fear in all our walk called for, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 17. We ought to be in the fear of the Lord all the day long; and there is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar fear called for in the Ordinances of his Worſhip, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 23. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. which was commended in <hi>Levi, Mal.</hi> 2. 5. On the other hand, oppoſite to this, is that carnal fear and anxiety, which is commonly called ſervile and ſlaviſh fear, and the fear of man which bringeth a ſnare, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 25.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Look after the breaches of this Commandment, by conſidering what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the obedience we owe to him as God, and our God: Now internal and external obedience may both be comprehended in this, every man ought wholly to give away himſelf, and the uſe of all his faculties and members, for the Glory of God, and to him only, and to none other: And this requireth a practiſe that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, both as to the inward bent of the will and heart, and alſo as to all the external parts thereof, which being ſeriouſly pondered, O! how often will we find this Commandment broken? as the particular comparing of our life with the Word, and the explication of the reſt of the Commandments, may eaſily clear and diſcover.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſin of impatience, which is oppoſite to that patience and ſubmiſſion we owe to God in his wayes and Diſpenſations, is one of the ſpecial breaches of this Commandment: it is very broad, and doth many wayes diſcover it ſelf: As 1. In fretting at Events which befall us. 2. In not ſubmitting chearfully to Gods way with us but repining againſt it. 3. In wiſhing things had fallen out otherwiſe then God hath diſpoſed. 4. In limiting God, and preſcribing to him, thinking that things might have been better otherwiſe. 5. In not behaving himſelf thankfully for what he doth, even when his Diſpenſations and croſs and afflicting.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This Commandment is broken by the many ſins which are oppoſite to that Adoration and high eſteem, that we ſhould have of God in our hearts; he ought to have the Throne, and be ſet far up in our minds and affections; but oh! how many are there that will not have one ſerious thought of him in many dayes, and are far from being taken up with him, or wondering at him and his way with ſinners, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, When Invocation and Prayer is ſlighted, this Commandment is broken, when he is not by calling upon him acknowledging in every thing, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when internal prayer in frequent ejaculations to God (as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 2. 4.) is neglected.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THis Commandment is more largely ſet down then the former, partly to clear the Mandatory part of it, and partly to preſs it; in which two it may be taken up.</p>
               <p>The preceptive, or commanding part, is expreſſed in two things, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and <hi>v.</hi> 5. at the beginning. 1. That no Image be made: And 2. That it be not worshipped.</p>
               <p>Next, it is preſſed three wayes: 1. From a reaſon. 2. By a threatning. 3. By a Promiſe: The words are multiplied, that they may the more fully and clearly expreſs what is intended.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Commandment is againſt all making of Images for Religious ſervice, is clear from a threefold extent mentioned in the Prohibition. 1. The Image of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Heaven above, or the Earth beneath, or under the Earth; that is, the ſimilitude of no Creature is allowed for this end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men are forbidden to make either <hi>ſimilitude or likeneſs,</hi> that is, no ſort of Image, whether that which is ingrave in, or hewn out of ſtone, wood, ſilver, &amp;c. or that which is made by painting, all kinds are diſcharged.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No ſort of worship or ſervice religious is to be given to them, whether mediate or immediate, whether primarily as to themſelves, or ſecondarily with reſpect to that which they repreſent. This is underſtood under the ſecond part of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor ſerve or worship them:</hi> under which two, all external reverence is diſcharged, which is clear from the reaſon adjoyned, becauſe God is jealous, and he will not only not endure Idolatry, but whatever may look like it; as a jealous Husband will not abide any ſuſpicious-like carriage in his Wife.</p>
               <p>That we may have the clearer acceſs to the meaning &amp; uſe of this Commandment: let us ſee 1. What is the ſcope of it. 2. Wherein it is different from the former.</p>
               <p>The ſcope of this Commandment, is not mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly and only to forbid making and worſhipping of Images, which is the moſt groſs way of abuſing the worship of God; but under that to forbid all manner of groſneſs in the external worship of God, and to command exactneſs and preciſeneſs in it (as well as internal worship) according to the Rule preſcribed there anent by the Lord; and ſo this Commandment includeth all
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:31633:32"/>
externals commanded in the Ceremonial Law, and doth forbid all will-worſhip, and ſuperſtition in the worship of God, all honouring him by precepts taught by men, and not by himſelf, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29. 13. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 9. So then in the firſt Commandment the worshipping of the only true God is commanded, and the worshipping of any Idol is forbidden: here the true worship of that God is preſcribed, and the contrary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; the firſt Commandment sheweth who is to be worshipped, the ſecond how he is to be worshipped, not in the manner that Heathens worshipped their Idols, nor in any other manner that men shall feign and deviſe to themſelves, but in the manner he himſelf preſcribeth.</p>
               <p>In ſum, this Commandment holdeth forth theſe three things. 1. That God will not only be ſerved inwardly in the heart, by good thoughts and intentions (which is preſcribed in the firſt Commandment) but alſo outwardly in the confeſſing him before men, in external ſervice and worship, in words and geſtures ſuitable; for the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this ſort of external geſtures, worshipping and bowing before Idols, doth include the contrary affirmative in all its kinds (according to the firſt Rule before-mentioned for the right underſtanding of all the Commandments.) Thus it taketh in all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Word, Prayer, Sacraments, Ceremonies, &amp;c. and failing in theſe, breaketh this Commandment, when even they are not rightly gone about.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It holdeth forth this, that in that external ſervice and worship, God will not have men following their own humour, but will have them to walk by the Rule gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or to be given by him to them, and otherwiſe it is in vain whatever worship men perform to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 9. Hence it is ſaid here, <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy ſelf;</hi> that is, at thy own pleaſure, without my Command, otherwiſe what is by Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is made to him; and this is to be extended to all Ordinances, yea both to the worship it ſelf, and alſo to the manner of that worship, all is to be done according to Gods Command only.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It holdeth forth a ſpiritual ſervice due to God, or that we should be ſpiritual in all external ſervice, there should not be in us any carnal apprehenſions of God, as if he were like any thing that we could imagine, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 29. as is fully clear from <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 15, &amp;c. Alſo all rashneſs and carnality in external performances is here diſcharged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>be wing to Images.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So then, under theſe three, we take up the ſum of this Commandment, whereby it differeth from the former, which may alſo be cleared from theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is, that this Commandment looketh to external worship, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of that; which is clear: 1. Becauſe the things forbidden in it, as making of Images, and bowing to them, are external acts. 2. Theſe are mentioned as relating <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o Gods Worship, for they are placed in the firſt Table of the Law, and for this end Images are only mentioned, as made uſe of by Heathens in all their worship, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 1. The Lord will not have his people doing ſo to him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. 3. Add, that making and worshipping of Images are but one part of mens abuſing of the external worship of God, which is mentioned for all of that kind (as Adultery is put for all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs in the ſeventh Commandment) and all kinds of falſe worship, or all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes of mens abuſing the external worship of God are condemned under it. 1.

                  </gap>arve out unto you.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon to clear this to be the meaning, may be taken from the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Law, which lieth in this, that it condemneth all ſin, and commandeth all duties: now it is a ſin not only to worſhip falſe gods, but to worſhip the true God in a falſe way; and it is a duty alſo to worſhip him rightly, according as he hath appointed in his Word; now theſe ſins muſt be forbidden in this ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, or they are forbidden in none at all; and theſe duties muſt be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this Commandment, or they are commanded in none.</p>
               <p>Next, that we may clear, that it is ſinful to worſhip God otherwiſe then he hath commanded, it would be obſerved, there was a twofold Idolatry found in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and condemned in the Scripture: the firſt was, when Groves and Images were planted, and made to Idols; and ſo the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did often to the Heathen Gods: the ſecond was, when they had Groves, and worſhipped in high places, but not to Idols, but to the Lord their God, as 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 33. 17. ſo in that place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3 4. &amp;c. you will find two things forbidden. 1. Making of Image to the falſe Gods, which the <hi>Cana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nites</hi> worſhipped. 2, Making uſe of their manner of worſhip, and turning it unto the true God, both are forbidden, the firſt by the firſt Commandment, the laſt by the ſecond; compare <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. (which hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth forth this ſcope.) <hi>Ye ſhall not do, every man what ſeemeth right in his own eyes,</hi> with what followeth, and with <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. and 31. <hi>See thou enquire not how theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons worſhipped their gods,</hi> to wit, by Images. &amp;c. <hi>as if ye would do ſo to the Lord,</hi> no, but <hi>verſ.</hi> 32. <hi>Whatſoever thing I command you, obſerve to do it, thou ſhalt not adde thereto nor diminiſh from it,</hi> which cleareth the ſcope of this Command, as being purpoſely there opened up, <hi>Ye ſhall not do ſo to the Lord your God,</hi> wherein more is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded then is expreſſed; namely, not onely ye ſhall not ſerve the Lord, as they do their gods, but alſo ye ſhall ſerve him, as he himſelf preſcribeth.</p>
               <p>Hence will it clearly appear, that this command is to be reckoned a diſtinct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from the former, becauſe 1. It containeth diſtinct matter, forbiddeth ſins of another kind, and commandeth duties of another kind. 2. Becauſe they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ten in number, and there cannot be ſuch a reckoning made up if theſe firſt two be one, it being clear (as after will appear) that the laſt is only one, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be divided into two. 3. Beſide, it is the common reckoning of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Jews, as may be ſeen from <hi>Joſephus, lib.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> and others; This then being laid down as a truth; we ſhall 1. ſhortly put by ſome Queſtions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Images for clearing the words. 2. Come particularly to ſhew, what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and what is forbidden in this Commandment, and how we break it in our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary practiſe, Then 3. Open the Reaſons that are annexed,</p>
               <p>Concerning Images, two things are to be enquired. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If no Image be lawful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if any be lawful, what theſe be? 2. If any uſe, eſpecially religious, of Images be lawful? and if adoration of any kind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to be given to them; We ſay for Anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That making of Pictures of Creatures, which are viſible, or may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, or hiſtorical phanſies (to ſpeak ſo) ſuch as the ſenſes and elements uſe to be holden forth by (which are rather Hieroglyphicks then real Pictures) theſe I ſay,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:31633:33"/>
are not ſimply unlawful, but are ſo, when they are abuſed; (ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> made Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Lions for his uſe, and thus the gift of engraving and painting as well as others which God hath given to men, may be made uſe of, when (as hath been ſaid) it is not abuſed.) As<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. When ſuch Pictures are obſcene and filthy, and againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian modeſty to behold, ſuch break this Commandment, but more eſpecially the ſeventh, becauſe as filthy communication doth pollute the ears, ſo do they the eyes. 2. When men become prodigal in their beſtowing either too much time, or too much expence on them. 3. When they dote too much on them by curioſity, and many other wayes they may be abuſed: but eſpecially in the fourth place, if they be abuſed to any religious uſe, then they become unlawful, as afterward ſhall be cleared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p n="2">2. Though making of Images ſimply be not unlawful and diſcharged by this Commandment, yet thereby every repreſentation of God (who is the Object to be worſhipped) and every Image <hi>religiouſly made uſe of in worſhip</hi> is condemned (though civil and political Images and Statues, which are uſed as ornaments, or badges of honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or remembrance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch Images cannot but beget carnal thoughts of God, (as <hi>Acts</hi> 6, 29.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this Commandment. 2. Becauſe God diſcovered himſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4, 15, 16, &amp;c. by no likeneſs, but only by his Word, that they might have no ground of likening him to any thing. 3. Becauſe it is impoſſible to get a bodily likeneſs to ſet him out by, who is a Spirit and an infinite Spirit, ſo then every ſuch image muſt be derogatory to God, as turning the Glory of the inviſible God, to the Shape of ſome viſible and corruptible Creature, which is condemned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 22, 23. for every Image ſuppoſeth ſome likeneſs; Now there can be no conceivable or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable likeneſs betwixt God and any thing, that we can invent, therefore it is ſaid by the Lord, Iſai. 40. 8. <hi>To whom will ye liken God, or what likeneſs will ye compare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>Therefore upon theſe Grounds, 1. We ſimply condemn any delineating of God, or the Godhead, or Trinity; ſuch as ſome have upon their buildings, or books, like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Neither is there any warrant for drawing him in theſe shapes, more then to look on every living Dove, as repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him: and the like may be ſaid of Gods appearing ſometimes in humane like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it was but that men might have ſome viſible help to diſcern ſomething of Gods preſence, but not to give any repreſentation of him, and theſe bodies were but for a time aſſumed, as a praeludie and fore-running evidence of the Sons being to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man.</p>

politick worſhip (ſuch as is given to living men, yea from that civil reſpect which one will give to the Image of a King, or of one they love, which is not properly worſhip even civil) and conſiſteth in other circumſtances of a religious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it may be known to differ from what is Civil, by theſe things. 1. By the thing to which the worſhip is given, that is, if it be a thing, which paſſeth not under a Civil, but under a religious account, as bowing to a living man is one thing, to a Saints Image, a Sacrament, or ſuch like, which have nothing in them, calling for ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil honour is another thing; and therefore, if any honour be given them it muſt be on another account. 2. By the actions, wherein we give ſuch worſhip, as if it be in prayer or in worſhipping of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or in ſacrificing, it is one thing to bow then to or before an Image or man, and another thing to do it when occaſionally or hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorically we are relating ſomething, or doing ſome civil buſineſs, as tying the ſhoo or ſuch like. 3. By the ſort of worſhip that has been given to Idols or uſed in religious ſervice to God, and not ſuitable for any civil reſpect to ſuch an object, as bowing the knee, uncovering the head, praying, building Temples, Altars, making Vows unto them, or before them, ſwearing by them, or before them, carrying them about with us becauſe of ſome religious influence they are ſuppoſed to have, ſetting them up for reverence to be given to them, ſetting up lights about them, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, burning incenſe to them, &amp;c. or ſomething of that kind uſed ſometime in Gods ſervice, or in the ſervice of Idols.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider, that what is ſaid of Images may be ſaid of all creatures and things to which divine honour, or religious worſhip in the ſervice of God is attributed, for if the one fall all will by this Commandment be overturned, ſuch as 1. Worſhipping of Angels or Saints by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as Mediators and helps in our ſerving the true God. 2. All adoration of the reliques of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, ſuch as their bones, duſt, cloaths, &amp;c. Eſpecially the adoration of the very Croſs (as they ſay) whereon Chriſt ſuffered, which hath by Papiſts a divine ſacrifice offered to it, and a divine worſhip given in the higheſt degree. 3. The adoration of ſuch things as are uſed in worſhip, as Temples, Altars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bread in the Sacraments <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> Maſſes, &amp;c. 4. The Images of God, Chriſt, Saints, Angels, yea of the Croſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are ſaid to be worſhipped with reſpect to the true God, and not as derogatory to his ſervice.</p>
               <p>For further clearing of this purpoſe, we ſhall ſpeak to a queſtion which here ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily occurreth; namely, whether theſe things mentioned; being worſhipped by any ſort of religious ſervice, whether directly or indirectly for themſelves or for ſuch things to which they relate, or which they ſignifie, even when men pretend the worſhip is not given to them, but ultimately referred to the honour of the true God, whether I ſay worſhipping them ſo, be not Idolatry and a breach of this Commandment?</p>
               <p>In anſwering this queſtion. 1. We ſhall clear that there may be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is Idolatry committed with Images<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and means of Gods ſervice, even in ſuch worſhip wherein the Images which men worſhip are not accounted gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only repreſentations of God, and although theſe means of worſhip, which they worſhip are made uſe of in ſerving the true God. 2. We ſhall clear, that all ſuch ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as being Idolatry is forbidden by this command, however it be diſtinguiſhed. If it be performed as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſervice, though ſome ſuch ſervice be more groſs, and other ſome more ſubtle and refined.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:31633:35"/>
Firſt then, That there is ſuch a kind of Idolatry in worſhipping of Images, when men reſt not on the Images, but direct their worſhip to the God repreſented by them, we may clear it divers wayes.</p>
               <p>And 1. From the Heathens, who though ſome did, yet all of them did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count their Images their Gods, but only ſome repreſentation of them, and firſt we may gather this from <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 22. 23. where it is ſaid of them, 1. That they knew God, and yet 2. That they turned the glory of that incorruptible God into the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of Beaſts and men, corruptible Creatures. Their fault is not that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted theſe repreſentations or Images, which they made gods, but that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined in their worſhip, in the worſhipping of the true God by ſuch Images.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may alſo appear by the frequent changes of their Images, while they retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their former gods, and by their multiplying Images of one ſort, and divers ſorts to one and the ſame god, and by their giving all theſe Images one name, and when it is ſaid that <hi>Solomon</hi> and other Kings ſet up Images to <hi>Aſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oroth, Baal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp;c. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought they ſuppoſed theſe Images to be the very gods themſelves which they worſhipped, but that they were only ſet up for their honour, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. 13. And when <hi>Manaſſes</hi> made Chariots to the Sun, he ſuppoſed them not to be to the Sun. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. 11. Yea was not this commonly acknowledged that <hi>Jupiter</hi> was in Heaven, as appeareth <hi>Acts</hi> 19 39. and that that Image came down from him, but was not he, nor yet the feigned Goddeſs <hi>Diana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It may appear by the Heathens own confeſſion, and the ſhifts they uſed, when they were charged with the worſhipping the works of their hands, as 1. They uſed to ſay they worſhipped but the <hi>Numen</hi> or god which was in them, and which inviſibly after their dedication of them (and not before) dwelt in them; yea, ſome of them would ſay, they neither worſhipped that Image, or any Devil, but by a bodily ſign they beheld what they ſhould worſhip. 3. When Chriſtians further urged them, that what was ſignified by their Images was not the true God, but a creature, as by <hi>Neptune,</hi> the Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by <hi>Vulcan,</hi> the Fire, &amp;c. They replyed it was not thoſe bodies which they worſhipped, but the gods which governed them. So <hi>Augustine, Pſalm</hi> 113. <hi>nobis</hi> 115. concerning the Idols of the Gentils, and <hi>Auguſtine de Civitat. Dei lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. where he ſheweth that <hi>Varro</hi> giveth that reaſon, why the gods where rather pourtrayed in mans picture (though they were inviſible) becauſe, ſaith he, mans Soul is a ſpirit and cometh neareſt them, and the body is the veſſel of the Soul, and therefore is uſed to repreſent it. See <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And it may alſo 4. appear from this, That the Heathen gods for the moſt part (even thoſe of them that were moſt commonly worſhipped) were ſome famous men, after death ſuppoſed to be Deified, to whom they made Statues and Images, and yet ſtill the honour was intended to thoſe to whom they appointed the Images, though they ſuppoſed that their gods in an eſpecial manner dwelt in theſe Images, and anſwered from them.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place this may be made to appear from the Command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 31, where the Lord forbiddeth not onely the worſhipping of Idols, but of himſelf by Images, <hi>Thou ſhalt not do ſo to the Lord thy God;</hi> that is, Thou ſhalt not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me by Images as the Heathen do their gods; and therefore this is not onely poſſible, but is alſo, and that moſt certainly, a grievious guilt, even though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31633:36"/>
it was not idols but God they worshipped; yet it was not ſo they worshipped not him but the idol.</p>
               <p n="3">3, We shall clear it yet further, That the true God may be worshipped (by Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) as they pretend, and yet in Gods account, their worship is nothing but idolatry committed with their images.</p>
               <p>We shall give four inſtances of this. The firſt is from <hi>Exodus</hi> 32. where it is clear, 1. That the image they ſet up was not it ſelf acknowledged to be God, but as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to repreſent the true God, for 1. It cannot be thought their minds were ſo ſoon darkened as altogether to forget what God had done, and to imagine that the thing which was new made with hands was God, though they be charged with forgetting God, becauſe they were practical forgetters of him, and their ſin did ſpeak it out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. 2. The image is called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was a mercy paſt before the Calf had a being, and therefore the reaſon why they gave it this name, muſt certainly be, becauſe they aimed by it to repreſent <hi>Jehovah.</hi> 3. It is not likely that now they would have worshipped the gods of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or that they would have attributed their delivery from <hi>Egypt</hi> to them, ſeeing theſe gods were alſo plagued; alſo that <hi>Aaron</hi> should do ſo, is incredible, who yet joyned with them in this tranſgreſſion. 4. Beſide can it be thought, that ſo ſoon they thought it to be God, and yet ſo eaſily afterwards paſſed from it? certainly the words, <hi>That it may go before us,</hi> that is, not to <hi>Egypt,</hi> but <hi>Canaan,</hi> whether God called them, do clearly imply, that they looked on it only as a repreſentation of <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is clear, that they ſacrificed burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before this image, and this was the ſame ſervice which was due to the Lord, and ſo it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 5. and therefore it was to the Lord, and not to the image (for it ſelf) that they ſacrificed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is clear, that they are charged for <hi>turning out of the way,</hi> and that becauſe of their <hi>making a molten image,</hi> which ſeemeth to infer, that their guilt was rather in the manner of worship and making of that image for worship, then in quitting God alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and thus they groſly failed in the manner of worshipping him, by occaſion of <hi>Moſes</hi> his abſence, for now they want that ſign of Gods preſence, which formerly they had, and have not ſuch a viſible commerce (as it were) with God, it is that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, and this want of a viſible ſign (and not of God ſimply) do they intend to make up by this image.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This may be further confirmed from <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 40. 41. 42. where it is ſaid, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this ſin they were given up to groſs idolatry which could not be, had this been idolatry of the groſſer ſort.</p>
               <p>The Second inſtance is from <hi>Judges</hi> 17. where you will find that that Idol, which <hi>Micah</hi> made, is not by him or his Mother accounted God, but is made uſe of by them, as they think, for furthering them in Gods ſervice, as appeareth. 1. From this, that it getteth not the name of any ſtrange god. 2. That he ſeeketh a Levite for a Prieſt to it, and promiſeth to himſelf Gods bleſſing from that, not that the idol would bleſs him, but <hi>Jehovah, verſ,</hi> 13. 3. That it is ſaid, the Prieſt asked counſel of <hi>Iehovah</hi> for the <hi>Danites, Judges</hi> 18. 6.</p>
               <p>The Third inſtance is that of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who did ſin and made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin, by the Calf he ſet up at <hi>Dan &amp; Bethel,</hi> that they were not intended to be worshipped as idols, for themſelves, but as means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby they might be helped to worship the true God, may appear, 1. From <hi>Ieroboams</hi> motive, which was not to divert the people from the true God, atleaſt as he ſuppoſed, or to make them alter their God, but to alter their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worship, and to divert them from going up to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to worship, from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31633:36"/>
which his fear of their revolt to <hi>Rehoboam</hi> aroſe; hence the Calves are not provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to prevent worſhipping of God, but are put in place of their going up to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> as the colour of reaſon pretended by him for this alteration ſheweth; and ſo one ſervice is put for another, without changing their God, and all the reproofs that his ſins meeteth with from the Prophets run at this, that he altered the manner of Gods worſhip in putting up new ſigns in new places, and appointing new Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Prieſts. 2. It appeareth from this, that as it was diſtinct from that way of ſerving God, which was in <hi>Judah,</hi> ſo was it from the way of the Heathens, yea from the way uſed by ſuch idolatrous Kings as <hi>Achab,</hi> who are ſaid to do worſe, becauſe they did ſet up ſtrange Gods (which the Calves are not called) and <hi>Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim;</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> when he deſtroyed the falſe Gods, yet he retained this manner of Worſhip; and there were no cauſe to diſcriminate <hi>Jeroboams</hi> ſin from <hi>Achabs,</hi> or to look upon it as any thing leſſer, if all the difference had been only in the change of worſhipping the image of one Idol into the worſhipping of the image of another, but the difference was in this, that the one worſhipped the true God in theſe images<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other Idols indeed. 3. Hence there was ſtill ſome knowledge of God in that Land, and Prophets ſometimes ſent them by the Lord; yea, when they were led captive, and others ſent into their place, it is ſaid 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 26, &amp;c. They lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the manner of the god of the Land, that is the true God, though they corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted themſelves with ſerving their Idols alſo, and thus the <hi>Samaritans</hi> continued worſhipping they knew not what, though they pretended to worſhip the true God, <hi>John</hi> 4. 22.</p>
               <p>The Fourth inſtance is that corrupt practiſe, uſed ſometimes in <hi>Judah</hi> of ſetting up high places and groves, when yet they did not thereby intend to ſerve Idols, but the true God, and yet they are reproved for this as a groſs Corrupting of the worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>And it would ſeem clear ſometimes in <hi>Judah,</hi> and often in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even when they are charged with Idolatry, that yet the knowledge of the true God, was not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate among them, nor they ſo bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tiſh in their worſhip as other Nations about them; we take it then for a clear truth, that they often did worſhip the true God, by Images, when they did not worſhip the images directly.</p>
               <p>The Second thing may be eaſily cleared and made out, to wit, that all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God by images though the worſhip be pretended to be given to the true God, and not to the image, but to the thing ſignified or repreſented by the image, is yet unlawful and Idolatry, forbidden by this commandment what ever ſort of worſhip it be, if it be religious, as hath been ſaid, and this we ſhall make out by theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p>The firſt is from the general ſcope of this Command, which is to forbid not only the over-turning of Gods Service, but alſo all Will worſhip, though mixed in with the Service (as it ſeemeth, that was which is mentioned, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8. of worſhipping Angels, which yet was ſo ſubtile that they pretended, they were far from taking from God any thing that was his due<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) that this is the ſcope of this Command, is clear from <hi>Deuter.</hi> 12. 8. where the Lord forbiddeth men in his Worſhip, <hi>To do what ſeemeth good to every one in his own Eyes:</hi> But ſo it is, that the worſhipping of God before Images, &amp;c, is Will-worſhip, &amp;c. till it be ſhewen that it is preſcribed by God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:31633:37"/>
Secondly: That way of Worſhipping God is clearly condemned by them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This binds us to the Word for all inſtitute wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but eſpecially reſtraineth us from Idolaters, their way of worſhip as well as from their Idols, <hi>Thou ſhalt not do ſo to the Lord thy God:</hi> Note, that <hi>So</hi> ſet down, <hi>v.</hi> 4. relateth to Groves, Images, High places, &amp;c. mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 3. which place doth not only diſcharge ſuch Service to be given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that worſhipping him by Groves and High places be condemned, why not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping him by Images alſo? for the prohibition <hi>So,</hi> looketh to all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: This Command hath a general prohibition in it, that leaveth no Image out, whether of God, Saint, or any other thing for any Religious uſe under what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhape: For 1. It diſchargeth the making of any Image of any thing, for any Religious uſe. 2. It diſchargeth all Worſhip to be given them, whether outward by <hi>Bowing,</hi> or inward by <hi>Service,</hi> or whatſoever followeth on theſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no diſtinction uſed by Idolaters can ſalve the matter, or avoid the ſtrength of this Command, eſpecially conſidering that it directeth men in the manner how they ſhould ſerve the true God, and doth not ſimply preſcribe who is to be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as true God, which is done by the firſt Command.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: If by this Command Heatheniſh Idolatry, or the Serving God by Images be condemned? then the ſerving of God by Images alſo amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is here condemned; But the Heathens ſerving God by Images, is here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If it be anſwered that Heathens did repreſent by their Images that which wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as they made uſe of to repreſent them; then alſo Chriſtians muſt be ſaid not onely to worſhip what is repreſented, by thoſe Images, but the Images themſelves, and ſo to be guilty of Idolatry on that account: the Reaſon will hold alike in both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if their Exception, that they worſhipped not the Images, but what they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented did not exempt them from being found guilty of worſhipping ſuch Images in particular, neither will Chriſtians upon that Plea be found exeemed from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the Papiſts in worſhipping of their Images, and God by them, is to be condemned
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:31633:37"/>
as Idolatry: But the former is condemned in Scripture as groſs Idolatry, becauſe it falleth off, and declineth from the way of worſhip the Lord hath preſcribed, and turned Gods People like to Idolaters in their way; therefore alſo the latter is to be condemned as idolatry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>There is no exception which the Papiſts give in here againſt this Argument, but the like might have been given by the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 1. If they ſay, They worſhipped not the true God before theſe Images, that is anſwered already.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If they ſay, it was condemned becauſe they repreſented him by ſuch images, that is not enough: For 1. The Command forbiddeth all images of any thing: 2. The oppoſition mentioned, Deut. 4. <hi>Thou ſawest no likeneſs, or Image, but heardeſt a Voyce,</hi> hath no middle, but argueth againſt all alike: Hence theſe Images, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 115. that had Noſes and Mouths, but ſmelled not, and ſpoke not, were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as well as thoſe complained of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If they ſay, It was not lawful then, but is lawful now; this were to ſay, that the Goſpel admitteth of more Carnal Ordinances then the Law, whereas its Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is more ſpiritual without all doubt.</p>
               <p>From all which we may clearly conclude, that in ſuch Service there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Idolatry committed: 1. In that, becauſe of ſome holineſs and venerability, that is ſuppoſed to be in ſuch Images, Reliques, &amp;c. Religious worſhip (though inferiour to what is attributed to God) is given to them for themſelves, according to the Decrees of that ſecond Counſel of <hi>Nice:</hi> 2. In that they pretend by ſuch Service to worſhip the true God, though in an idolatrous manner forbidden by him, beſides what <hi>Aquinas</hi> and his followers maintain, who give to the Images of God, Chriſt, <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Croſs, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> it ſelf, <hi>part</hi> 13. <hi>q.</hi> 25. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 1, 2, 3. And Reaſon ſayeth, it is a ſnare unto them that worſhip them, and a ſcandal to others; for, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (ſpeaking againſt the expreſſions uſed by Heathens from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. and from that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. (after he hath rejected their images, and their interpretation, and excuſes alſo) ſayeth, <hi>he who worſhippeth and prayeth towards an Image is an Idolater;</hi> for, <hi>who,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>worſhippeth and prayeth towards an Image, who is not affected with it as if it heard him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort then, the Idolatry that ſtriketh againſt this Command, may be ſummed up in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When by ſome viſible ſign, repreſentation, or Image, the God head is wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as being thereby made like to it; this is againſt <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 15, 16, 17, &amp;c. where every Image made to repreſent the true God, is condemned as unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When by our worſhip we tye the preſence of the true God, to ſome Place, Image, Statue, or Relique, as if they had ſomething in them, or communicated to them more divine then any other thing; or, as if God heard our Prayers better at Images, and by them; or as if there were a more ſpecial preſence of God there, or a more ſpecial diſpenſation of grace granted by them; as Heathens ſuppoſed their Gods dwelt inviſibly in their Images, and did anſwer them there. Now the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that there is in any thing ſomething venerable and worthy of ſuch reſpect, is the ground of all idolatry; the inward leaning to it, and truſting in it, is againſt the firſt Command; but the outward expreſſing of this eſteem and truſt is againſt the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:31633:38"/>
ſecond Command: Thus men ſin in praying to things that are (though rational Creatures) as Angels and Saints; or to things that are not, as empty Images that have no Deity dwelling in them, or to lifeleſs Creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Croſs, Bread, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is Idolatry, when idolatrous worſhip, uſed in the Service of Idols, is given to God contrary to his Command; ſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 30. 31. <hi>Thou ſhalt not do ſo to the Lord thy God;</hi> and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 17. Their keeping up of Groves for the worſhip of God; and that invention of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calfs, are condemned as Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When any thing of that External worſhip, which is due to the true God, is given to any other, even though it be with a purpoſe not to ſhut him out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together from his due, yet when it is in part given to any other thing, as to the Croſs, Saints, Images, &amp;c. it is called worſhipping of them; ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Pſalm</hi> 106. 19, 20. there they worſhipped the Images of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, &amp;c. yea, <hi>verſ.</hi> 37. Devils, though they intended to worſhip God in theſe Images.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When any thing of this worſhip, due to God, is given to Servants or means, as if ſomething adorable, and to be worſhipped, were in them, although they be not accounted God himſelf: Thus <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſinned in worſhipping <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 10. 25, 26. when he knew he was not God, and <hi>Peter</hi> rejecteth it on this ground, that he was a Man and not God; and that therefore it was due to none but God: which Reaſon, taketh off all that can be ſaid by men for palliating this kind of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: Thus the ſcope of the Command, and the reaſon and ground of worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered, it is evident that all theſe are idolatry.</p>
               <p>We would now further conſider, firſt, the poſitive part of this Command, and next what is forbidden in it.</p>
               <p>And 1. For the poſitive part of this Command, we conceive it doth reach, 1. To all external Ordinances, ſuch as Doctrine, Worſhip, government, and Diſcipline: We are here enjoyned to keep all theſe pure, according to his word: Thus any errour breaketh this Command, when it is vented and made publick, as ſecret er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours break the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It reacheth to all external <hi>Obedience,</hi> ſuch as receiving the truths of God, ſubmitting to the government and diſcipline of his Houſe, entering therein as Church-Members, often hearing the Word, not only on the Sabbath, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the fourth Command, but at all occaſions, when God ſhall give the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, it being a ſpecial part of his worſhip; right uſing of the Sacraments, and worthy receiving of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> praying externally, internal prayer being required in the firſt Command; outward confeſſion of ſin, when called for; confeſſion of the truth in times of tryal, &amp;c. and this obedience is to be extended to extraordinary duties as well as ordinary; as Vowing, Swearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faſting, &amp;c. when they ſhall be required in providence; external Covenanting with God, an Ordinance neceſſary for keeping pure publick Service, &amp;c. Alſo it is to be extended to ſecret duties, and to private duties in Families, and Chriſtian fellowſhip, as well as to publick, and to diligence in them all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It reacheth to the right manner of doing duties; eſpecially, it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth 1. That they be not done in Hypocriſie, for God will not be ſo worſhipped in any duty. 2. That all our worſhip and duties be directed to God, in, and through
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31633:38"/>
the Mediator, and that none come to God but by him, who is the appointed High Prieſt. 3. That all our Obedience and Service be Spiritual.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It taketh in all external geſtures, and outward reverence in praying and hearing, &amp;c. as, that the eye be fixed, and the carriage not light, but decent; that there be no laughing, that the look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be ſtayd and grave; theſe in a ſpecial manner, in worſhip, are to be looked unto.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It requireth every Mean that may further Gods publick Service, as edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating and training up men for the Miniſtry, entertaining them, providing places and accommodations for publick worſhip, and every thing of that kind, without which the external worſhip of God cannot be performed.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It requireth the removing of all letts and impediments of Gods worſhip, or whatever is contrary thereto, according to our places and ſtations; ſuch as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies and Hereticks by condigne cenſuring of them, removing all idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and whatever may be occaſions of it, or whatever hath been, or may be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to it, purging the Houſe of God from corrupt and inſufficient Miniſters and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Members.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee in the next place what is forbidden in this Command, and how it is broken.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Command, what immediatly reflecteth upon God himſelf, is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; here, what immediately reflecteth on his Ordinances and appointments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting them and Him in them, is diſcharged; there is none of the Commands more frequently broken, and yet men moſt readily think themſelves free of the breach thereof, and therefore ye ſhould conſider, that it is broken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>1. In Doctrine, or doctrinally. 2. In practiſe. 3. In both, when the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines vented and publiſhed againſt truth, have external practiſes following on them, as that doctrine of Image-worſhip hath, which we have ſpoken to already, and is the groſs breach of this Command; and the Lord inſtanceth it as being the greateſt, becauſe where this is, all ſorts of idolatry are: for it ſuppoſeth idolatry againſt the firſt Command, and that ſome eſteem and weight is laid upon that Creature we worſhip, beyond what is its due; as if there were in it ſome divinity or ability to help, whereby it is thought worthy of ſuch honour, whereupon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that external worſhip which is given to it upon that account; and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Saints are thought able to hear and help, men pray to them; and becauſe the Croſs is thought holy, men worſhip it, &amp;c. and as this idolatry is manifold among the Papiſts, ſo it is palpable when Prayer is made to Saints, Reliques, Bread, the Croſs, images, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now that we may further explain this; conſider, that this Command is three ways broken doctrinally. (all which have a great influence upon mens breaking of it in their practiſe;) or, the Service and Worſhip of God, is three ways wronged by the Doctrines of men. 1. When ſome thing is added to his Service which he hath not commanded, and this is ſuperſtition and will-worſhip largely ſo taken: Of this kind are 1. The 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Popiſh Sacraments added to thoſe two the Lord apppointed. 2. Other and more Mediators then the One Mediator Chriſt. 3. More merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſes of Pardon and Juſtification, then the blood and merits of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. More Officers in his Houſe then he hath appointed, ſuch as Biſhops, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. More Ceremonies in worſhip, as Salt, Spittle and Cream, added in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:31633:39"/>
Baptiſm to Water, and Kneeling, &amp;c. to the Lords Supper. 6. More Holy dayes then God hath inſtituted. 7. Other things to be acknowledged for the Word of God then the Scripture, as Traditions, Apocrypha, &amp;c. and many ſuch things, whereof (for the moſt part) Popery is made up.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is broken when his Ordinances are diminiſhed, and any thing which he hath commanded, is taken away from them, as is clear from Deut. 4. 2. <hi>Ye ſhall not add unto the Word which I command you, neither ſhall ye diminiſh ought there from:</hi> and thus they break this Command, by taking away the Cup from <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>icks</hi> (as they call them) in the Lords Supper, and the uſe of the Bible from the People in their own Language; alſo it is broken by taking away Baptiſm from Infants, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline or Excommunication from the Church, and by taking away the Sabbath-day, and publick ſinging of Pſalms, or ſuch like; not to ſpeak of that Blaſphemous, and ſome-way Pagan-Hereſie of <hi>Quaqueriſine,</hi> over-turning moſt, if not all the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, deſtructive to all true Religion and Chriſtianity, and introducing, at leaſt having a native tendency to introduce, old Paganiſm and Barbarity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This Command is broken by corrupting of Gods worſhip, as when the Word is miſ-interpreted and miſ-applyed, Prayers are uſed in a ſtrange Tongue, the Word is mixed with Errours, and the Church, both left without Diſcipline and abuſed in civil things, which tendeth to the corrupting of Gods Service; unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied-men put into the Miniſtry and kept in it, when Sacraments are reſted on and worſhipped, even as the Brazen Serpent was abuſed, and the Temple though appointed by God at firſt for good ends, was afterward reſted on and Idolized.</p>
               <p>Again, this Command is practically broken four wayes: Firſt, by groſs propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and neglect of the practiſe of known duties of worſhip; this way, are guilty all prophane Contemners of Sacraments, Word, Diſcipline, &amp;c. All Neglecters of them when they may have them: and all theſe that ſet not themſelves to go right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about them, in ſecret, in Families or in Publick; and where many opportunities of Goſpel Ordinances are, this ſin is the more frequent; and ſo all Atheiſts that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne Religion, and theſe that would only ſerve God with a good heart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as they pretend, without any outward worſhip, are condemned here; and alſo thoſe, who for fear or advantage give not teſtimony to the Truth and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt, when ſuch a teſtimony is called for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men ſin againſt this Command, when they practiſe will-worſhip and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition in ſerving God by duties he never required, whether 1. It be Will-worſhip in reſpect of the Service it ſelf, as when that is gone about as duty, which is not in it ſelf lawful, as when ſuch and ſuch Pilgrimages and Penances are appointed by men to be done as Service to God: Or 2. When worſhip, or Service under the Goſpel is aſtricted to ſuch a place, as if it were Holier to pray in one place then in another, and that therefore God did hear Prayer there more willingly and eaſily then in another place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or 3. In reſpect of bodily poſture, as if there were more Religion in one poſture then in another; as in receiving the Lords-Supper knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or Praying in ſuch and ſuch a poſture, except in ſo far as it is decent, and otherwiſe rightly regulate by rules of Prudence and Natures light. 4. When it is without a Divine Warrant tyed to ſuch a time only, as <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> (commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Yool) Eaſter, Paſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> &amp;c. which is an Obſerving of times that God hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:31633:39"/>
5. When it is tyed to ſuch an occaſion or accident, as, to Pray when the Clock ſtriketh, or when one Neeſeth, which <hi>Plinius</hi> marked of <hi>Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erius,</hi> who was no Religious man, yet could not abide one who lifted not his Hat when he Neeſed, and ſaid not, <hi>God bleſs;</hi> and he obſerveth it among theſe things he can give no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for; the Prayer is good, but the timing of it ſo, and aſtricting it to that thing, is ſuperſtitious; ſo your Lightwakes and Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iges (as ye call them) are upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be condemned, either as ſuperſtitious, or as prophane, or at the beſt, as the reliques and cauſes or occaſions of both: For 1. Once in times of Popiſh dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they were ſo uſed, or rather abuſed. 2. Why are your Viſits ſtinted to ſuch a time more then another? It profiteth not the defunct, and it hurteth the perſon you come unto; a multitude not being ſit for comforting or inſtructing; and yet it cannot be called a meer civil viſit, being tryſted with ſuch an occaſion; but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it ſuiteth not, nor is it a Chriſtian carriage toward the Dead, and after the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of the Dead, to ſpend time together in ſuch a way as is commonly uſed: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, it is ſuperſtitious, when a thing without reaſon is aſtricted to ſuch a time or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as giving and receiving of gifts on <hi>New-years-day,</hi> too too common amongſt Chriſtians, though a Heatheniſh cuſtome; which day, as <hi>Gratian</hi> obſerves, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to their Devil-god <hi>Janus:</hi> He aſſerts like wiſe, that ſuch Chriſtians, as in his time did obſerve it, were Excommunicated; and <hi>Alchuinus,</hi> with others, write that the whole Catholick Church appointed once a ſolemne publick Faſt to be kept on a <hi>New-years-Day,</hi> to bewail thoſe Heatheniſh Interludes, Sports, and lewd Idolatrous practiſes that had been uſed on it. 6. When ſome weight is laid on the number of words, or ſet repetitions of Prayers, <hi>Ave Maria's,</hi> or <hi>Pater Noſters,</hi> or on the reading ſo many Chapters, or ſaying ſo many Prayers. 7. When any take a word of Scripture at the opening of the Bible, or by a thought ſuggeſted, as more befitting their condition becauſe of that, without weighing the Word it ſelf; and lay more weight upon that word then upon another that hath the ſame authority and ſuitableneſs to their caſe, which is to make a Weerd, or Fortune-book of the Book of God, for which end he never appointed it. Thus alſo men are guilty, when they account Sacraments more valid, or lay more weight on them, becauſe diſpenſed by ſome Miniſters, then when diſpenſed by others, though having the ſame warrant, or becauſe of the difference of perſons that partake therein with them;</p>
               <p>However ſome of theſe things may be in themſelves good, yet they are abuſed by ſome one circumſtance, as in unwarrantable timing them, or in laying that weigh on them which is not warranted in the Word, which 1. Altereth the way that God has laid down. 2. Bringeth us to prefer one circumſtance to another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any warrant. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Maketh a neceſſity where God has left us free, and ſo brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us into Bondage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may go wrong in practiſing lawful duties many wayes, as to the manner of performing them, when they are not ſo done as is required: As 1. When we do not propoſe to our ſelves the right end we ſhould have before us. 2. When they are not done from a right inward Principle. 3. When they are done in Hypocriſie and Formality, and reſted on; all which may go along with men in all Duties and Ordinances; and generally all our ſhert-comings in the right manner of comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded duties, ſtriketh againſt this Command.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:31633:40"/>
Fourthly, We may alſo conſider the breach of this Command, by taking a view of what is oppoſite to every thing required; and ſo want of Reverence in Worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> want of Zeal againſt errour of falſe worſhip, not ſtreatching our ſelves in all lawful endeavours to entertain and maintain the true worſhip of God, are here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; ſo likewiſe the putting in, and keeping in unworthy Miniſters; the traducing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> holding out, and putting out of Faithful Men; the with-drawing and Sequeſtring their maintenance from them; the diminiſhing of it, or ſtraitning them in it. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſins, though little thought of, and lightly looked on by Men, drawing no leſs deep before God then obſtructing the free courſe of the Goſpel, breaking up the treaty of peace betwixt God and Sinners, carryed on by Faithful Miniſters, as the Ambaſſadors of Jeſus Chriſt; and ſaying on the matter that he ſhall not ſee of the fruit of the travel of his ſoul in the ſalvation of the ſouls of men to his ſatisfaction, ſo far as they can impede it by outing and diſcountenancing his Miniſters, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made uſe of by him for bringing about that laſt warrantably; and thus alſo, all Sacriledge, <hi>Simony,</hi> and the like, cometh in as breaches of this Command; and all Partiality in Church proceedings, Tolleration of Errours, countenancing the ſpeaders of them, ſlighting of diſcipline, converſing unneceſſarily and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with ſuch as are Excommunicate, and all unwarrantable innovating in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal worſhip of God; and when we are not ayming and endeavouring to have our Children and Servants, and all under our charge, brought under ſubjection and conformity to the Ordinances and Service of God as well as our ſelves.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this Command in an eſpecial manner looketh to publick Ordinances, let us ſee a little more particularly how it is broken in theſe: 1. In reſpect of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Hearing. 2. Publick Prayer. 3. Praiſing. 4. Sacraments. 5. Faſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in all theſe, there are faults of three ſorts. 1. Some going before the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theſe duties. 2. Some following after. 3. Some going along in the performance of them.</p>
               <p>And again, 1. Some are guilty of the breach of this Command by neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe duties. 2. Some are guilty in the wrong manner, of going about them.</p>
               <p>And 1. Before hearing the Word men break this Command. 1. In not Praying for the ſpeaker. 2. In not Praying for themſelves, in reference to this end, that they may profit by the Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. In not ſetting themſelves to be in a ſpiritual compoſed frame for ſuch a work. 4. In not watchfully preventing what may divert them or diſtract them, or ſtraiten their minds when they come to hear, not ordering their other affairs, ſo as they may not be a hinderance to them in meeting with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Goſpel. 5. In not aiming to have the right eſteem of the Word. 6. In not bleſſing God for it, or for any good received before by it. 7. In not coming with hunger and thirſt, as new born Babes, having laid aſide what may hinder its, being received with deſire, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 8. In not denying our own ſtrength, as to the right diſcharge of that duty, that ſo we may make uſe of Chriſt. 9. In not minding that when we are called to hear, it is to tryſt with God in his Ordinances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. In going to hear with prejudice. 11. In coming without expectation of, and longing for the preſence of God, or of meeting with him. 12. In not coming from reſpect to the honour of God; nor out of Conſcience, but from cuſtome, and for the faſhion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Men ſin againſt this Command, when they are come to hear, and while
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31633:40"/>
they are about this duty of hearing: 1. In not looking to God, or not receiving the Word as Gods Word, but as Mans. 2. In extravaging and wandring in their minds and thoughts. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. 3. In ſleeping when they ſhould hear. 4. In letting the Word ſlip out of their mind, and not retaining and laying up what they hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 5. In not yielding their ears and memories, or yielding onely their ears and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but not caſting open their hearts to the Word, to let it ſink down in them. 6. When though it be heard, yet it is not underſtood, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 13. 7. When though underſtood, it is ſoon forgotten. 8. When there is not a peculiar trembling and fear in our waiting upon the Ordinances, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66. 2. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 1, 2. and <hi>Malach.</hi> 2. 5. There is a ſpecial fear which we ought to have <hi>before his Name.</hi> 9. VVhen there is not Faith mixed with hearing, giving credit to the VVord, it muſt be a great fault not to believe Gods VVord when we hear it, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 1, 2. 10. VVhen we fret and canker at the reproofs of the Word. 11. VVhen we needleſly ſtumble at any expreſſion, eſpecially when we carry ſo lightly as to laugh at what is ſpoken, to the prejudice of the Ordinances. 12. VVhen we are more for knowing then for doing, more for informing the mind, then for reforming the heart and life. 13. VVhen there is carping at the VVord, or cenſuring of it rather then our ſelves. 14. VVhen we make no application of it to our ſelves, and try not whether we have ſuch a fault, or if we perform ſuch a duty, &amp;c. 15. VVhen we are not preſent, as before God, to hear, as <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> was, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 33. 16. VVhen we itch after novelty of expreſſions, or words, or things, rather then thirſt after the ſincere Milk of the Word, that we may grow thereby. 17. When theſe novelties are more entertained and laid weight on then known duties or truths. 18. When the Word is heard with reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the ſame truth, or expreſſion, or Scripture cited by one, is not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected and received, as when ſpoken by another, contrary to <hi>James</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. 19. When there are vain looks as well as idle thoughts. 20. When there is a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, light, unreverent carriage. 21. When there is immodeſt and ſtrange Apparel unbecoming that Ordinance. 22. When there is ſpeaking or talking, out of the caſe of neceſſity, in time of Sermon, though it were by way of Prayer, it is ſinful, except it were Ejaculatory in reference to what is at preſent ſpoken. 23. When there is reading of ſomething, (even though Scripture) unſeaſonably. 24. When there is inſiſting on good thoughts, that tend to divert from hearing. 25. When men are obſerving Vanities in time of hearing, ſuch as the Apparel that others have on, or the painting that is on the Houſe, or the cuplings of the roof, or ſuch like. 26. When there is not an intermixing of Ejaculatory Prayer for our ſelves and others, and the Speaker, that God would help him, and them, and us, to keep ſuch a Word to the time when we may have need of it; and when God is not bleſſed when a word is rightly ſpoken. 27. When there is any quenching of convictions, or the motions, or ſtirrings of affection wakened up by the Word. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>8. VVhen thero is diverting to a doting love of the Speaker, or the thing as ſpoken by ſuch a Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; or the manner of expreſſion, and a delighting in theſe, more then in God, or a reſpecting of Him or our own profiting. 29. VVhen we do not look upon, and make uſe of the Preached VVord as a means to con ert, but onely as a mean to confirm. 30. VVhen we do not make uſe of Promiſes offe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed in Preaching, and directed by God to us by an Authorized Ambaſſadour, and do not ſo lay weight on them as from him. 31. VVhen we reject the many ſweet offers of the Goſpel, and come not to the Marriage of the Kings Son. 32. VVhen we do grieve Gods Spirit who preſſeth it upon us. 33. VVhen we tread
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31633:41"/>
under-foot Chriſts Blood by our little eſteem of it. 34. When we give no credit to, nor lay doe weight upon threatnings. 35. When we have not the Faith of Gods Providence, or of the Judgement to come, 36. When there is not an accepting of Chriſt. 37. When there is not imploying of him. 38. When there is not reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in removing from our hearing of the word.</p>
               <p>After hearing alſo, there are many wayes whereby we are guilty of the breach of this Command. 1. Forgetting what we have heard. 2. Letting the heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily look back again to other objects, and follow other thoughts, and not meditating on what hath been heard. 3. Not comparing what we have heard with the Scriptures. 4. Not following the Word with prayer for the watering of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.

Finding out ſhifts to put by its directions or challenges. 16. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them to others rather then to our ſelves. 17. Miſ conſtruing the Miniſters end in preſſing of them. 18. Miſ-interpreting his words. 19. Miſ-reporting or miſ-repreſenting them. 20. Not being troubled for fruitleſneſs in hearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without any uſe, but being as a ſtone without ſence or feeling. 21. Leaning o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>All theſe wayes men may ſin, when they come to hear the Word; they ſin alſo by abſence when they come not, neglecting the opportunities of the Goſpel; there are alſo divers ſins which men are often guilty of in reference to hearing, even on week dayes: As 1. Little love to the Word, or delight in the opportunities of it on ſuch dayes. 2. Too much love to ſome other things that procureth luke-warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in hearing. 3. Contemning occaſions of hearing the Word on ſuch dayes. 4. Improvidently bringing on a neceſſity on our ſelves that we cannot hear. 5. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring little to have a Miniſtry, whereby we may be inſtructed at all times, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we want ſuch occaſions. 6. Setting our ſelves, and uſing our wits to diſcourage the Miniſters we have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. Not being weighted on, with our abſence from week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes Sermons. 8. Mocking at them who are preſent. 9. Diſ-reſpecting the Ordinance for ſome worldly or perſonal reſpects, preferring any ſmall trifle thereto, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us inſtance the breach of this Command in publick prayer, which is a part of worſhip, which very nearly concerns the glory of God; and certainly when it is wronged through the unſuitable, and nor right diſcharging of this duty, this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is in a ſpecial way broken.</p>
               <p>We ſhall not here look to every thing, but eſpecially to what concerneth publick Prayer, indeed we fail alſo in ſecret Prayer, and in giving Thanks both alone and in

our Families. 1. By contempt of this excellent Ordinance, many ſlight Prayer in ſecret and in their Families, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> which is a clear breach of this Command as well as neglecting it in publick, when men do not countenance Sermon or Prayer, though at the ſame time walking Idlely in the Street or in the Fields. 2. By caſting up of Prayer to others, reproaching it, calling it Hypocriſie, and thoſe who uſe it Hypocrites. 3. By mocking the Spirits work in Prayer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Before we come to Prayer, we ſin. 1, By not watching to keep the heart in a frame for Praying always. 2. By not watching over every opportunity that we may have for Prayer, whereby many occaſions are loſt. 3. In not longing for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Prayer. 4. In not ſtirring up our ſelves to ſeriouſneſs when we are about to Pray. 5. In letting the heart run looſe when we are about other things, which indiſpoſeth for Prayer. 6. In having a ſelfy particular end before us in our Prayers. 7. In our little reſpecting God for ſtrength and fitneſs, and little looking to him for his Spirit to our ſelves, or theſe who are to go before us in this duty of Prayer. 8. In our little examining our ſelves that we may know what to Pray for, and what diſtinctly to confeſs. 9. In our not meditating on what we are to ſay, that we may as to the matter of our Prayers ſpeak in Faith. 10. In aiming more to find and exerciſe gifts, then to have grace acting in us. 11, In our ruſhing raſhly on ſuch a weighty and ſpiritual duty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In Prayer; and 1. On the Speakers part there are divers ways where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this Command is broken: As 1. By raſhneſs and ſenceleſneſs, not exerciſing the ſpirit, but the mouth, telling over our Prayers as a Tale without life. 2. Praying in our own ſtrength, without looking after the influence of the Spirit. 3. Not drawing near to God by Faith in Chriſt, but leaning too much on our Prayers, from a ſecret falſe opinion of prevailing more with many words well put together, then by exerciſing Faith on Chriſt, and reſting on Him, as if God were perſwaded with words. 4. Inadvertant Praying, uttering unadviſed Petitions and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without underſtanding. 5. Not praying humbly and with ſoul abaſement: Nor 6. Singly to pleaſe God, but men, ſeeking expreſſions that are pleaſant rather then ſenſible. 7. Saying many things we think not, not being touched with the weight of ſin when we confeſs it, nor with the deſire of holineſs when we mention it: counterfeiting ſometimes liberty and boldneſs, ſometimes reſtraints and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints more then is real. 8. Limiting God in particular ſuits. 9. Cold in what is of greateſt concernment. 10. Want of reverence and holy fear. 11. Want of a right impreſſion of a preſent God. 12. Not praying for others, and little reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition of thoſe we pray with; or what we do of this kind, is either but cold, and for the faſhion; or if there be more apparent zeal and ſeriouſneſs for others, it would be adverted that it be not upon deſign to flatter and pleaſe them rather then to obtain ſpiritual bleſſings to them. 13. Deſiring things for ſatisfying our ſelves more then for Gods honour. 14 Breaking off before we come to live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and liberty, having begun lazily and without life. 15. Not inſiſting to wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle with God when under Bands. 16 Precipitating with the words before the heart ponder them, or the affection be warmed. 17. Poſting through it, as duty, only for the faſhion, without reſpect to God, or love to the exerciſe, or driving at any profit by it. 18. Wearying and not delighting in it. 19. Not aiming at Gods preſence or ſenſible manifeſtations in it, or at a Hearing in that which we
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:31633:42"/>
pray for. 20. Being more deſirous of Liberty in publick then in private. 21. Fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting when we are put or kept under Bonds. 22. Growing vain and light when it goeth well with us, and turning carnal and unwatchful when we get liberty. 23. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent uſe-making of Scripture-words, either ignorantly or vainly. 24. A ſecret expectation of ſomething for our Prayer, and ſo reſting upon the work done, as if there were merit in it. 25. Uſing expreſſions not eaſily underſtood. 26. Uſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent geſtures, and ſcurrile expreſſions. 27. Not obſerving Gods diſpenſation to us, nor his dealing with our ſouls in the time of Prayer, that we may conform our ſuits accordingly, as we find many of the Saints have done, who end in Songs after they had begun ſadly. 28. Not praying with fervency for Chriſts Kingdom, and for Jews and Gentils. 29. Exerciſing gifts rather then grace, when we pray. Theſe are Sins upon the Speakers part.</p>
               <p>Next, ye ſhould conſider the ſins of them that joyn: And beſide, what is general and common in the duty of praying, we fail often in joyning. And 1. In this, that many think, When another prayeth they need not pray, but let the Speaker be doing alone. 2. When we obſerve not what is ſpoken, that we may go alongſt in what he prayeth for, and be upon our watch that we may joyn, and that we may do it in judgement. 3. The mind waving or wavering, and we hearing, but not praying. 4. Cenſuring the words or geſtures of the Speaker. 5. Fixing our eyes or minds on ſome other things, and giving way to other thoughts that may divert from joyning. 6. Sleeping in time of Prayer. 7. Confuſedneſs in that exerciſe, and not diſtinctly joyning with what agreeth to our ſelves and our own caſe, nor with what agreeth to others joyning with it for them. 8. More cold and indifferent in what concerneth others, then in what concerneth our ſelves. 9. More careleſs of being heard and anſwered when we ſpeak not, as if we were leſs concerned, thinking it enough to be preſent, although in our heart we joyn not; and not being affected with the prayer of another, nor acting Faith in it, we ſoon weary when others pray. 10. Not being edified by the praying of another, nor taking up our ſins in his Confeſſions, nor our duty in his Petitions. 11. Much Hypocriſie in ſuch duties, while we ſeem to be joyning, but are doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. 12. Not endeavouring to have affections, ſuitable to what is ſpoken, ſtirred up in us. 13. Not praying that the Speaker may be ſuitably guided and helped in bringing forth Petitions that may anſwer our wants. 14. More indifferent that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other who ſpeaketh as mouth for the reſt, want liberty, then when we are put to ſpeak our ſelves, although it be Gods Ordinance. 15. Not rightly touched with any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion we cannot joyn with, but rather ſtumbling at it. 16. Our being ignorant of the meaning of many expreſſions through our own fault, ſo that we cannot joyn in them. 17. Muttering words of our own, and not joyning with what is ſaid. 18. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctneſs in conſenting or ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> at the cloſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. After Prayer both Speaker and Joyners fail. 1. That they watch not over their hearts, but ſoon return to other things, as if then they might take liberty. 2. Not waiting for an anſwer, nor obſerving whether Prayers be anſwered or not. 3. Not being thankful for Anſwers when they come: Nor 4. Intreating and preſſing for an anſwer if it be delayed. 5. Not reflecting on our failings, whether in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or joyning. 6. Not remembring what we have uttered in Prayer, but preſently returning to a carriage that is very unlike thoſe things we have been ſpeaking before Him. 7. Not keeping up a frame for new opportunities of Prayer. 8. Not preſſing after a conſtant walk with God betwixt occaſions of Prayer. 9. Reſting on Prayer after we have done, and thinking ſomething of it if we ſeem to have been helped to Pray 10. Carnally heartleſs and diſpleaſed, if it hath been otherwiſe. 11. Not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31633:42"/>
being humbled for the ſinfulneſs and defects of our Prayers. 12. Not having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe by Faith to the Blood of ſprinkling for pardon of theſe ſinful defects.</p>
               <p>We are to conſider how men break this Command in Praiſe and Thankſgiving: And here there is failing, in general. 1. In the utter neglect of this neceſſary duty; alace, what of that duty do we in ſecret, and yet it is ſingularly for Gods honour, and as clear a duty as Prayer. 2. In mocking praiſe often, by prophaning Pſalms for our carnal mirth. 3. In neglecting and ſlighting of it, though not altogether, yet by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequent going about it. 4. In accounting it to be almoſt no duty at all, and in being but little challenged for ſlighting of it, or for irreverent uſing of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly. We ſin before we go about this duty: 1. In not preparing for it. 2. In not praying for the Spirit, to fit and enable us to Praiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15. and for a fixed heart for that work, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 108. 1. 3. In our not aiming at a ſpiritual diſpoſition for ſuch a ſpiritual duty. 4. In our not endeavouring for a right impreſſion of the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of God. And 5. For clearneſs of our intereſt in him: And 6, For an impreſſion of the excellency of his way, and meaning of his Word; all which are exceeding neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary unto the right performance of this duty, and without them we cannot Praiſe ſuitably.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. We are guilty of many faults in the time of praiſing. 1. Doing it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to Gods glory, and for the fashion only. 2. Hypocriſie, not praiſing him with the whole heart, performing it only with the lips, when the heart is away. 3. Ignorance, when we want underſtanding of the words we expreſs. 4. No ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble impreſſion of Gods greatneſs and goodneſs upon our hearts when we praiſe. 5. Not aiming at Communion with God in this duty, as deſiring, minding, and hoping to praiſe him for ever. 6. Not being taken up with Spiritual and Heavenly delight in him, and in the work of his praiſe, 7. Lightneſs, laughing, or mainly affecting of, and carnally doting upon, ſome tone or voyce more then being ſuitably affected with the matter, and making melody in the heart to the Lord. 8. Forgetting what we do ſing, and not knowing or conſidering what it is we ſing, the heart not being preſent nor fixed. 9. Not being conſtrained by love to praiſe, but ſome cuſtome or natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience conſtraining us to it. 10. Not offering up our praiſes in and through Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 15. 11. Soon ſatisfied in our praiſing, as if we were little troubled to be fitted for it, and becauſe little of our ſelves lyeth in it, we are the leſs careful how we diſcharge it, but ſtint and limit our ſelves to ſome certain cuſtomary matter which puts us to few prayers before, and makes but few challenges after. 12. Not intermixing ejaculatory prayers in our praiſings. 13. Much Hypocriſie when we ſing the caſes of others, or their thoughts and eſtimation of God, and ſtudy not to be ſomething-like their frame and exerciſe. 14. Not framing our affections in praiſing to the ſubject of our praiſe; whether it be ſome ſad caſe or ſome chearful condition, or ſome Hiſtorical or Prophetical ſubject; and when imprecations are a part of the Song, we ſoon fall off, or praiſe one and the ſame way in all. 15. Not ſerious in bleſſing God for former mercies to his Servants, if it be not ſo well with us in the mean time, nor chearfully acknowledging his former deliverances of his Church and people in which we have not perſonally shared. 16. Not being affected with his keeping of us free of many ſad caſes we ſing, and others have been in, nor bleſſing him for delivering them. 17. Not letting the Word of the Lord which we ſing, ſink down in us for engaging our hearts to, and chearing our ſpirits in good. 18. Not aſſenting to, and giving him glory in the acknowledgement of the juſtneſs of his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt threatnings, and the moſt fearful Scripture-Imprecations. 19. Not rightly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving thoſe things that are the ſubject matter of Scripture Songs, ſo as to put a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:31633:43"/>
difference between ſome things we are to tremble and ſcare at, ſuch as the falls of the Saints; and other things which we are to imitate and follow for our edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 20. Gadding in idle looks, ſo that ſome ſcarce look on their books (although they can read) that they may the better have the ſenſe of what they ſing. 21. Not putting a difference betwixt praying a Petition that is in a Pſalm, and ſinging of it, which ſhould have a ſweetneſs with it that may incourage us to pray for, and expect what others before us have obtained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22. Wanting ſuch conſiderations about the matter ſung, when it ſuits not our preſent caſe, as may ſuitably affect us, and fit us to glorifie God in that duty: as when we ſing of the eminent holineſs of ſome of the Saints, we are to bleſs him that ever any was ſo holy, whatever be our ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and that we have hope of pardon, though under many failings, and much unlikelineſs to that caſe we ſing. 23. Not ſinging with the voyce at all, although the tongue be given us as our <hi>Glory,</hi> that we may therewith thus glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. After we have been about this duty of praiſe, we ſin. 1. By fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling immediatly into a carnal frame. 2. Not looking back or examining when we have done, how we carryed it in praiſing God. 3. Few challenges for our many failings in praiſe. 4. Little Repentance for thoſe failings. 5. Not keeping the heart right for a new opportunity of praiſe. 6. Not keeping a record of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in our memories, and upon our hearts to engage us to praiſe him. 7. Not walking in the exerciſe of love, which would ſweetly conſtrain us to this duty, and make us delight in it.</p>
               <p>Theſe are but a few of the many Iniquities that are to be found in our holy things, <hi>Exod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 28. 38. Its good we have a High Prieſt to bear them: O, what if all our ſins were reckoned, how hainous would they be? and what a ſum will they come to, if our performances of holy duties have ſo many ſins in them? and when the ſins of a Sabbath are counted, how many will they be? hundreds of divers ſorts, in praying, hearing, and praiſing; and multiply theſe to every looſe thought, and every declining or wavering of the heart, now many times may they be multiplyed? Ah! how many unholy words do we let ſlip, and then conſider all the Sabbaths and Sermons, Prayers and Praiſes we have had, how many hundred thouſands will they amount to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is ſad that men ſhould lye under all theſe with few or no challenges, or without minding repentance, or think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the neceſſity of employing the High Prieſt for doing them away; therefore we ſhould accept theſe challenges, and give Him employment who only can bear the Iniquity of our holy things. If this bring not down ſelf-Righteouſneſs, and convince you of the neceſſity of a Mediatour, what will do it?</p>
               <p>We ſhall proceed in the next place, to conſider the ſins that wait on receiving the Sacraments, which as they were a ſpecial part of the Worſhip of God under the Old Teſtament, ſo they are yet under the New; and our ſins in reference to them ſtrike againſt this Command, as it preſcribeth and carveth out our external Worſhip, and ſo much the rather ſhould we conſider this, becauſe there cannot be a more expreſs Covenanting with God in giving and receiving, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing terms and accepting of them for cloſing the Covenant, then is in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
               <p>Before we enter to ſpeak of the faults we are here guilty of, we may in general
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31633:43"/>
propoſe ſome things concerning the Sacraments: As 1. For what ends God hath appointed them, that ſo we may know what is to be expected in them. 2. How they effectuate the ends, that we may know how we ſhould go about them; and we ſhall ſpeak to theſe two joyntly, becauſe we cannot ſpeak to the one, but we muſt ſpeak to the other.</p>
               <p>But before we ſpeak to theſe, ſome things are to be premitted: As 1. That God hath thought good alwayes to add Sacraments to his Covenants; thus the Covenant of Works had its Sacraments: <hi>Adam</hi> had the Tree of Life for a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to confirm him in the Faith of that Covenant; ſo the Covenant of Grace in all its adminiſtrations had its Sacraments alſo for confirmation thereof, as before Chriſts incarnation it had, Circumciſion, the Paſsover, and divers Sacrifices effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual for that end; and the Fathers before <hi>Abraham</hi> had their Sacrifices for Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d ſince his Incarnation, it hath Baptiſm and the Lords Supper; for as the Lord has for mans ſake condeſcended to deal with him after the manner of men, by Covenants and mutual Engagements, ſo he keepeth the manner of men in Swearing, Sealing, and confirming theſe Covenants for their greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>conſolation, who are within the ſame, <hi>Hebr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 6. 18.</p>
               <p>Secondly. Although the nature of the Covenant alter the Sacrament, in reſpect of our uſe making of it; yet, as all Covenants have ſome eſſentials in which they agree, to wit, a Promiſe and a Reſtipulation; ſo all Sacraments have ſomething common, to wit, that they Signifie, Seal, and Strengthen the Covenanters in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of enjoying what is promiſed according to the terms of the Covenant to which they are as Seals appended, the Tree of Life confirmed the promiſe of Life to <hi>Adam</hi> upon condition of perfect Obedience; Circumciſion confirmed it to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> upon condition of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. The Sacraments of the Covenant of Grace before and after Chriſt, differ in circumſtantials, as the Covenant it ſelf under the Old and New Teſtament doth; but in eſſentials they agree, for they ſeal one and the ſame thing, and after one and the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. There are ſome chief things common to all Sacraments of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant under one adminiſtration; As for example, Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, they agree both in this that they ſeal the Covenant, and repreſent Chriſt and his benefits, &amp;c. yet in either of them there are ſome peculiar promiſes and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits eſpecially looked unto: and alſo they have their peculiar manner of ſealing theſe things which are common to both; Believers are alſo confirmed in the ſame things by the Word, but the Sacraments confirm them in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, more clearly, and ſenſibly, and proportionally to our weakneſs and neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Fifthly. No Sacrament is of, and from it ſelf valid, but its validity and efficacy is from the Covenant and Promiſe, whereof it is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo it is a ſeal to none but to ſuch as are in the Covenant, and keep the condition of it, to them it ſealeth the benefits promiſed, though abſolutely and ſimply it ſeal the truth of the conditional promiſes: and ſo it may be ſaid conditionally to Seal, to all the Members of the Church, the Truth of what is promiſed upon ſuch a condition; as for example, The Tree of Life ſealed this Truth, that who ſtood in perfect
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31633:44"/>
Obedience should have Life, but it did not ſeal to <hi>Adam,</hi> that he should have Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except upon condition of his perfect Obedience; the like may be ſaid of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Baptiſm, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sixthly. Hence every Sacrament doth ſuppoſe a Covenant, and the Receivers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into the Covenant, to which the Sacrament that he receiveth relateth: ſo that we come not to the Sacrament properly to enter into Covenant with God, but firſt the Covenant is entered, and then the Seal is added, as <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17. Firſt, God entered into Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and then the Seal of Circumciſion is added as a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</p>
               <p>Seventhly. No Sacrament giveth any new right which the Receiver had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; onely it confirmeth the right he had before; he hath acceſs to the Sacraments upon the account of his external right.</p>
               <p>Eighthly. Sacraments confirm ſtill ſomething that is future, and to come, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtituted for the confirmation of our Faith and Hope in thoſe things, of which we are moſt apt to doubt; as the Paſsover ſtrengthened the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> againſt the fear of being deſtroyed; the Tree of Life confirmed what was promiſed to <hi>Adam</hi> and not performed; and ſo all Sacraments help us to believe the making good of ſome promiſe not performed, for they ſerve as the Oath and Seal; and indeed, when we Preach the Goſpel, we offer a ſealed Covenant, and a ſworn Covenant.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being promiſed, we come to ſpeak to the things propoſed; and we ſay, The Sacraments of the New Teſtament (of which only we ſpeak purpoſely) have in Gods appointment and our uſe, theſe three ends eſpecially;</p>
               <p>The 1. is, to repreſent clearly the nature of the Covenant, and the things promiſed therein, as, the washing away of ſin, Chriſt himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his death and benefits, and the way how we come to the application of all theſe, to wit, by Faith freely, putting on Jeſus Chriſt for taking away guilt, and ſtrengthening us to an holy walk; in all theſe the Sacraments (that is, the ſigns and word of inſtitution added) do fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1. To the Ears: 2. To the Eyes: 3. To our other ſenſes of feeling, &amp;c. not only hold forth what is offered, but our way of cloſing with and accepting of that Offer; as if God, who by Preaching letteth us hear him ſpeak (inviting us to be reconciled to him) were in the Sacraments, letting us ſee him tryſt and cloſe that bargain with us by his Ambaſſadors; in which reſpect, the Sacrament may be called the <hi>Symbol</hi> and <hi>Token</hi> of the Covenant, as it is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. and this way the Sacraments have a teaching uſe to bring to our remembrance Chriſt, his ſufferings and benefits, as well as our eſtate, what it was without him, and before our cloſing with him; all this by the word and elements with the actions concurring, is repreſented to us, as if it were acted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, for making the way of the Goſpel the more clear to our judgements and memories, who either ſenſeleſly take it up, or ſluggishly forget theſe ſpiritual things; the Lord, who ſometimes maketh uſe of Parables and figurative expreſſions or ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, to ſet forth ſpiritual things to make them take with us the more, hath choſen this way to make uſe of external ſigns, and actions for the ſame ends alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond end of Sacraments is to ſeal and confirm Gods mind and revealed will to man, and to put him out of queſtion of the truth of his promiſes, that ſo he may have a further prop to his Faith, and may draw more ſtrong conſolation from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Covenant upon this ground. In this reſpect they are called Seals <hi>(Rom.</hi> 4. 11.) of the Righteouſneſs by Faith; that is, not the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, but of his obtaining Righteouſneſs by it, and not by works; that is, They are ſeals of that Covenant which offereth and promiſeth Righteouſneſs to ſuch as believe: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o was the Tree of Life a confirmation to <hi>Adam</hi> of the promiſe of Life; ſo was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:31633:44"/>
to <hi>Abraham</hi> a Seal and Confirmation of the promiſes of the Goſpel, as Gods Oath was, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 18. And ſo are the Sacraments to us,</p>
               <p>This Confirmation may be three wayes looked on: 1. As that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the Propoſition, 2. The Aſſumption, 3. The Concluſion of a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Syllogiſm, whereby the Believer concludeth from the Goſpel that he ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>The Propoſition is this, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved;</hi> this by the Sacrament is ſimply confirmed as a truth, that one may lean unto: Then the Believers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the Faith of that ſubſumeth, I will then take me by Faith to Chriſt: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is a ſure truth, I will reſt on him and hold me there; or more clearly, I do believe in him.</p>
               <p>Now 2. This aſſumption that <hi>I,</hi> or ſuch a man hath Faith, is not confirmed ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply by the Seal, for the Sacrament is to be externally applyed by men, who can ſay no more, but, They charitably judge ſuch a one to have Faith; yet it may be ſaid to be ſo far confirmed as one whoſe Faith doubteth may by this be encouraged to reſt on Chriſt, and quiet himſelf on him; Thus Faith is confirmed while it is helped to Aſſume, though the man be not clear that he hath aſſumed; as alſo one having according to Gods command, caſt himſelf on Chriſt, and according to his inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, taken the Seal, I ſay ſuch a man may conclude from the Seal, as well as from the Promiſe that he is accepted, even as one having prayed may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude he hath been heard, having done it according to Gods will in the name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When the Concluſion is drawn, <hi>Therefore I ſhall be ſaved,</hi> the Sacrament doth not confirm that ſimply to us, more then it did to <hi>Adam</hi> (who afterward brake the Covenant of Works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo attained not the thing Promiſed) but it ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it conditionally. <hi>If thou Believe,</hi> thou ſhalt be ſaved, and ſo the Aſſumption muſt be made out by the ſearch of the conſcience before the concluſion receive any confirmation by the Sacrament; yet by ſtrengthening the <hi>major propoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such as Believe ſhall be ſaved;</hi> it ſtrengtheneth the <hi>Concluſion</hi> alſo: for if that were not true, my having Faith, or flying to Chriſt were no great comfort; and ſo conſequently it has influence on the Believers comfort in the <hi>Concluſion,</hi> as Gods Oath and Seal did confirm thé Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and alſo ſtrengthened his Faith in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it ſhould be made out to him, <hi>Rom</hi> 4. 11.</p>
               <p>Again, it is to be conſidered that the Sacrament ſealeth particularly, not only as it ſayeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>All that Believe ſhall be ſaved,</hi> but alſo as it ſays, <hi>Thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if thou wilt Believe, ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> and the ſeal is ſo appended to that conditional Offer, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſtandeth not only ſure in general to all Believers, but to Me particularly upon my cloſing with it, as if God were particularly ſingling me out to make the offer unto me, and to take my engagement, and to put the ſeal in my hand, by which Faith is more particularly helped and ſtrengthened then by the Word alone; there is great uſe therefore of the Sacraments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that thereby we get Faith quieted in the believing of this, that God will lay-by his Controverſie, and keep his Covenant, and make forth-coming his Promiſes to thoſe who flye for refuge to Jeſus Chriſt, according to his Oath and Seal: Thus he ſealeth the <hi>Major</hi> Simply, the <hi>Minor</hi> Conditionally, but Particularly; Or we may ſuppoſe God ſpeaking to us from the Covenant thus, He to whom I offer Chriſt, he may receive Him; and all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:31633:45"/>
and receive the Offer, ſhall obtain the Bleſſing offered: But I offer Chriſt to thee: therefore thou mayſt and ſhouldſt receive him; and if thou accept the Offer, hou ſhalt obtain the Bleſſing offered, and ſhalt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And thus the Sacraments may be called <hi>Teſtimonies,</hi> of Gods Grace to us, becauſe particularly they ſeal that Offer of his Grace unto us, namely <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> by him, and his being content to give Him upon condition of our believing.</p>
               <p>The Third end and uſe of the Sacraments; is, to exhibit and apply Chriſt or his Benefits to Believers; hence in the Sacraments we put on Chriſt, and ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>

Hence it is that all this Communion is ſpiritual, conferred by the Spirit, and received by Faith; yet it is moſt real, and having a real Ground and Cauſe, and real Effects following, not by vertue of the Sacraments in themſelves, more then by the Word or Prayer conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the vertue of the promiſes being laid hold on by Faith. And now Word and Sacraments being joyned together, they concur the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually for bringing forth thoſe ends intended in the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. There is a fourth End which reſulteth from theſe, and that is a <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Conſolation,</hi> Hebr. 1. 6, 8. which by the ſtrengthening of Faith, and beholding of Chriſt in that Ordinance, and being confirmed in the hope of his Coming again, &amp;c. proveth very ſweet, and corroborateth the Soul ſo much the more, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that therein he tryſteth often with the Believer, and by it Communicateth himſelf to his Senſe and Spiritual feeling.</p>
               <p>Fifthly. The Sacraments hold forth a Mutual Engaging betwixt God and his People; God holdeth out the Contract, the Covenant and Offer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We by our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking do declare our acceptance of that Offer on thoſe Terms, and ingage accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, that we ſhall make uſe of that righteouſneſs therein held forth for our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and of that Wiſdome and ſtrength therein offered for our direction and Sanctification: In this reſpect our taking of the Seal, is called our <hi>Covenanting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17. he was to be puniſhed that wanted the Seal of Gods Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus our accepting and receiving, looketh to the Word, holding forth the Terms, and God ſealeth and confirmeth on theſe Terms the particular Promiſes of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and ſtrength to the ends before-mentioned, that our Faith may be ſtrengthened in making uſe of them.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the main and principal ends of the Sacraments, though they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:31633:45"/>
ſerve alſo for outward diſtinguiſhing of Gods People from all other ſocieties and perſons.</p>
               <p>In ſum, the Word offereth Chriſt and his benefits, the Hearer accepteth him, on the Terms on which he is offered, and conſenteth; both theſe are ſuppoſed to precede the Sacraments, though (as we may ſee in the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. and others) it may be but for a very ſhort time; yet in the order of Nature at leaſt, they are <hi>Prior,</hi> and then come the Sacraments, which have in them, 1. a clear view of the bargain, that we may cloſe diſtinctly, and know what we attain, 2. A ſolemn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation on Gods ſide of the Covenant, and the particular offer he therein maketh. 3. A furthering of us in part, and helping us to believe, and a conferring of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing offered. 4. A comforting of thoſe upon whom the Bleſſings are conferred. 5. The Receivers ſolemn and publick ingaging to God, that he ſhall obſerve and make uſe of all theſe; the Fifth may be looked upon, as the Second in Order.</p>
               <p>We may come now to conſider the Faults we are guilty of in reference to the Sacraments. And firſt in general, then more particularly in reference to Baptiſme and the Lords Supper: We ſhall not ſpeak to thoſe faults common to <hi>Popiſts</hi> and others, which are more Doctrinal, ſuch as Errours about the perſons who may Adminiſter them, as that Women may Adminiſter Baptiſm, &amp;c. But we ſhall ſpeak to thoſe that are incident to us in our practiſe.</p>
               <p>And firſt in general we fail, either when too much weight is laid on them, or when too little; Firſt, when too much, as 1. When there is an abſolute neceſſity ſuppoſed to be of them, in order to ſalvation. 2. When they are thought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Grace of themſelves, by the very partaking of the outward Elements, although without Faith. 3. When they are reſted on in the outward Receiving; as if that made us ſome way acceptable to God. 4. When there is a ſuperſtitious blind preferring of them to, and with, the prejudice of all other Ordinances, ſo that one will neglect Preaching and Prayer long, but muſt have Baptiſm and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. 5. When there is a preferring of the outward Ordinance to Chriſt and the thing ſignifyed; that is, when men ſeek more to have the Baptiſm of Water then the Baptiſm of the Spirit, and the External Communion more, then the inward; in which any Heaven that is to be found in the Ordinances, lyeth; and when men are more commoved for wanting the Sacrament once, then for wanting Chriſt often and long. 6. Coming unto, and going from, the External Ordinances neglecting him and without dependance upon him who giveth the bleſſing, and thinking that then all is well enough, ſeeing they were preſent at the Ordinance. 7. Going far off for the partaking of a Sacrament to the prejudice of neceſſary Moral Duties called for at that time. 8. Placeing more in them then in works of Mercy and Charity, or doating on them, to the neglect of thoſe. 9. When they are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo holy as if they might not be given, where Chriſt alloweth them to be given; or as if that wronged them, when they are not Adminiſtrated in ſome conſecrate place, as if one place were now under the Goſpel more holy then another. 10. Adding to Chriſts Inſtitution, in the way of Adminiſtration, as if what he hath appointed, becauſe it is common and ordinary, were baſe, and too low for them.</p>
               <p>Again, they get too little eſteem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1, When people uſe them as bare and empty
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:31633:46"/>
ſigns, without reſpect to their due ends. 2. When there is not that Reverence given to God in them as ought to be according to his command, when we are about ſo holy and ſo ſolemn pieces of Worſhip. 3. When men carnally and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preparation, and obſervation, can hazard on them as common things. 4. When Gods Grace and Goodneſs in condeſcending in them to us, is not admired and bleſſed. 5. When they are not pondered and ſtudied, that we may know them. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Want of delight in them. 7. Careleſneſs of them whether we have them or want them. 8. Corrupting the Lords Inſtitution in our manner of going about them, either adding to it, or diminiſhing from it or changing it, as if men might do ſo. 9. Little zeal to keep them pure. 10. Neglecting the occaſions of them when we may have them with ſome little pains. 11. Accounting them better when Adminiſtrated by one Miniſter, then when by another; or eſteeming little of them, becauſe diſpenſed by ſome men, (though lawful Miniſters) as if men added any worth to the Ordinance of God. 12. Never actually laying weight on any of them, or drawing comfort from them, or leſs then ſhould have been done. 13. Not wiſhing and praying that others may have good of them. 14. Not fearing the wronging of them by multitudes who partake of them, and not endeavouring to have abuſes of that kind helped, but making them common to all indifferently and promiſcuouſly. 15. When Folk fear not the breaking of their ingagements in them. 16. When men hang the Fruit of them on the Adminiſterers intention, or on the grace of them that are Joynt-partakers with them. 17. When there is little Zeal againſt the Errours that wrong them, as when they are denyed by <hi>Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptists,</hi> and when they are corrupted, as in the <hi>Maſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To come particularly to Baptiſm; we may conſider, 1. The ſins of thoſe who ſeek it for their Children. 2. The ſins of theſe who Adminiſter it. 3. The ſins of on-lookers, eſpecially thoſe who are called to be Witneſſes. 4. The ſins of thoſe who are baptized.</p>
               <p>The Parents or Preſenters of Children to Baptiſm fail before, in the time, and after the Adminiſtration of this Ordinance; Firſt, before, 1. By not ſerious min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that which is to be done. 2. Not conſidering the Childs condition as needing Chriſt in that Ordinance. Nor 3. The end of that Ordinance. 4. Miskenning Chriſt, and not going firſt to him, for conferring the things and bleſſings ſignified. 5. Not praying for the Child, for the Miniſter, and for a Bleſſing on the Ordinance. 6. Not bleſſing God, that there is a Covenant of Grace that taketh in our Children; not offering them to be ingaged and received in it. 7. Not minding the moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and edifying way of going about it, but walking by other Rules. 8. Needleſs delaying of it for carnal ends. 9. Being more deſirous of the Sign, then of the Thing ſignifyed.</p>
               <p>Secondly. When we come to it, we ſin. Firſt, Not ſeeking to have our own Covenant with God (by which we have this priviledge of bringing our Children to Baptiſm.) renewed and made ſure. 2. Not conſidering by what right we claim it to our Children. 3. Not repenting of our own Breaches of Covenant, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> wondering that God keepeth with us, who have often broken to him. 4. Not coming with the exerciſe of fear and reverence. 5. Waiting on it oft-times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attention or minding our Duty in what is ſpoken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. Promiſing for the faſhion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:31633:46"/>
when we ingage for the Childrens Education, and wthout either Judgement or Reſolute purpoſe to perform. 7. Being ignorant of what is ſaid or done. 8. Not concurring in Prayer for the bleſſing. 9. Not undertaking in Chriſts ſtrength to perform the Duties called for.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. After the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, we fail. Firſt, In forgetting all our engagements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. In growing careleſs to maintain any ſuitable frame, and falling carnally in our Mirth on ſuch occaſions. 3. Not being much in Prayer for the Children, nor inſiſting or continuing in Prayer for the bleſſing. 4. Not being Faithful according to our ingagements, in Educating them. 1. In knowledge, that they may be ſo trained up as to know what God is. 2. In the fear of God, preſſing it upon them by frequent Exhortations. 3. In giving them good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 4. In giving them ſeaſonable Correction (but rather ſparing them though to their hurt) when there is cauſe of Correction. 5. Being alſo unfaithful in not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly minding them of their ingagements by Baptiſm. And 6. Much more by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them evil Example. 7. Conniving at their faults. 8. Adviſing them to what is ſinful, or ſending them where they may meet with ſnares, or ſuffering them to go there. 9. Providing for them the things of this Life, without reſpect to that Life which is to come. 10. Not enabling our ſelves that we may diſcharge our Duty to them. 11. Not inſiſting to preſs thoſe things upon them, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their Souls alwayes; thinking it is enough that ſometimes they be ſpoken to. 12. Never purpoſely ſtirred up and driven by that Tye to ſee for their good. Nor 13. Repenting our many ſhort comings. Nor 14. Lamenting for what we ſee ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in them, when they follow not faithful advice. Theſe are things that would carefully be looked unto, both by Fathers and Mothers, and all ſuch as engage for the Chriſtian Education of the Children, whom they preſent to that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
               <p>Next in him that Adminiſtreth Baptiſm, there are oft-times diverſe failings. As 1. When it is cuſtomarily diſpenſed without reſpect to its end. 2. When in Prayer the Childs ſalvation is not really and ſeriouſly aimed at, but for the faſhion. 3. When it becometh a burden to diſpenſe it. 4. When it is not thought much of, that Chriſt admitteth ſuch into his Houſe, or himſelf to be a partaker of ſuch mercies, but be a Diſpenſer of them to others. 5. When he followeth it not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately with his Prayers for a Bleſſing; beſides what failings may be in unſuitable words, and humane Ceremonies, &amp;c. And ſeeking himſelf in the words that are ſpoken, rather then the Edification of the Hearers.</p>
               <p>When we are Witneſſes and On-lookers, we fail. 1. In wearying and fretting, becauſe we are detained a while. 2. Not ſetting our ſelves to be edified by that we ſee done and hear ſpoken. 3. Not ſympathiſing with the Child or its Parents in Prayer. 4. Not being thankful to God for ſuch a benefit and Ordinance to ſuch a Childs behoove. 5. Lightneſs of carriage, and in looking, ſpeaking, or thinking in the time, as if we were not preſent at ſuch an Ordinance of Chriſts. 6. Not ſo ſeriouſly taken up in ſympathiſing with other Folks Children, becauſe they are not our own. 7. Removing and withdrawing and not ſtaying to countenance it. 8. Not minding the Child when we are gone. 9. Not helping them as we may to be anſwerable to that tye they come under in Baptiſme. 10. Not admoniſhing them when we ſee Parents and Children walk unanſwerable, nor teſtifying againſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:31633:47"/>
them, nor mourning for the diſhonour God getteth by baptiſed Perſons unſuitable carriage.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. All of us that are baptiſed, fail wonderfully, leſs or more, Firſt, That we never (as we ought) reckon our ſelves obliged by that tye we come under in Baptiſm. 2. That we neither are, nor ſeriouſly ſtudy to be, as we ought, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it. 3. That we are not thankful for it to God, who admitted us to that Ordinance. 4. That we do not eſteem it above all bare carnal Birth-Rights how great ſoever 5. That we do not ſeek to have it cleared, in the extent of it, as to the Priviledges and Benefits thereby conferred on us and our Children. 6. That we do not purſue after the Bleſſing therein covenanted to us. 7. That we do not endeavour the performance of the condition of believing and truſting in Chriſt which is the condition of the Covenant of which Baptiſm is the Seal. 8. That we do not lay weight on our Baptiſm for ſtrengthening our Faith both in ſpiritual and temporal Difficulties, as if it were no Seal of the Covenant. 9. That we are ofte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ignorant how to make uſe of it. 10 That we do not account our ſelves wholly Gods, as being given away to Him in Baptiſm, but live to our ſelves. 11. That we do not fight againſt our Luſts, Satan, and the World, according to our baptiſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Vow. 12. That we do not adorne our Chriſtian Profeſſion with an Holy Life, 13. That we walk and war againſt Chriſt, inſtead of fighting under his Banner. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That we do not aggravate our ſins, as being committed againſt this T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

That we do not meditate on our ingagements nor repent for our Neglects. 17. That we do not aim and endeavour to come up to the main ends of this Ordinance. Which are, 1. The evidencing out Regeneration and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Chriſt. 2. The giving up our ſelves to the Father, Son, and Spirit. 3. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icking by Chriſt on the moſt coſtly and deareſt terms. 4. Taking directions from him and walking in him. 5. Seeking the things above, and not the things that are on Earth. 6. Mortification to Creatures, and to be crucified with Chriſt, 7 The improving of this Tye, not onely for obliging us to theſe, but for ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening us in Him to attain them, and to comfort our ſelves in all Difficulties from this ground. Theſe things are much a miſſing: Alace, they are much a-miſſing: For we lamentably neglect to draw all our Strength and Furniture under all tent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and for all Duties from Chriſt by vertue of this baptiſmal Obligation and Tye: We reſort but ſeldome to this Magazine and Store Houſe; this precious Priviledge is (Alace!) but very little manured and improved by us.</p>
               <p>We come next to ſpeak of the ſins we are uſually guilty of in reference to the Lords Supper, and they be of ſeveral ſorts. 1. Some are Doctrinal when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is corrupted, as in Popery: Theſe we will not now meddle with. 2. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are practical, and they are either in Miniſters and Elders, who admit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, or in ſuch as are admitted or debarred.</p>
               <p>And Firſt, we are to conſider, that men may ſin againſt this Ordinance, by not Communicating. As 1. When they contemn and wilfully neglect it. 2. When they are not frequent in it, but careleſly ſlight it, when conveniently it may be had, 3. By not fore-ſeeing and ordering our Affairs, ſo as we may not be hindred, when an occaſion of that Ordinance offereth it ſelf near to us. 4. By incapacitating
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:31633:47"/>
our ſelves to be admitted through ignorance or ſcandal, and by negligence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move theſe. 5. By fretting at our being debarred, or at theſe who has a hand in it. 6. Not repenting of the cauſes which procureth our being debarred. 7. Not ſeeking to be humbled under ſuch a weighty cenſure, and to get the right uſe of it for the time to come. 8. Suſpecting that it proceedeth from carnal ends. 9. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting amiſs of thoſe who do it. 10. Not praying for them that partake in this Ordinance, where-ever we hear of it in any place. 11. Looking rather to the unfitneſs of ſome that are admitted, and the neglect of duty in Office-bearers in debarring, then our own. 12. Not ſympathizing with them, and yet on that ground abſenting our ſelves, to wit, for the faults of others.</p>
               <p>And here, by the way, we beſeech you take theſe few words of Exhortation. 1. Look on debarring of ignorant and ſcandalous perſons from the Lords Table as Chriſts Ordinance. 2. Conſider wherefore your ſelves are debarred, and as you may be aſſured it is from no particular prejudice or diſ-reſpect, ſo ye would repent and be humbled for that which procureth it. 3. Be making up what is wanting for the time to come: your failing in any of theſe is a fault, and let none think themſelves the leſs bound to the ſtudy of holineſs, becauſe they are kept from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of it: But the ſin of ſome is; they ſhift it, becauſe they will not ſtir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to a ſuitable frame for it, and yet they are not ſuitably affected with the want of it.</p>
               <p>Next, there are faults in them that are admitted to Communicate, and theſe both in Hypocrites and true Believers reſpectively; and that 1. Before. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the time, and 3. After receiving the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>And firſt: Before receiving there are many failings: As 1. Ignorance of the end and nature of this Ordinance. 2. Not ſtudying to know it: Nor 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To have the heart rightly affected with it. 4. Not endeavouring to keep up a high eſteem, and holy reverence of the wonderful Love of God in giving of his Son, and the Sons condeſcending Love in coming to dye for Sinners. 5. Not ſeeking to have the Covenant clearly cloſed with by Faith, before it be ſealed by the Sacrament. 6. Not endeavouring to have all by-gone quarrels removed, and our Peace eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. 7. Not ſearching our way, that we may be well acquainted with our condition, ſo as we may have the diſtinct knowledge of it, when we come. 8. Not carefully endeavouring a ſuitable frame of heart by Prayer, Meditation and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. 9. Not praying for a bleſſing, either for him that adminiſtreth, or for thoſe who are to joyn with us, to prevent their ſin. 10. Not minding their inſtruction who are under our charge. 11. Not preſently renewing (if before cloſed with and conſented to) our Covenant before our partaking. 12. Not ſequeſtring our hearts from other things for that end. 13. Not fearing to miſs the thing offered, and to contract guilt inſtead of getting any good, 14. Not ſearching after the ſins of former Communions and other ſins, and repenting of them. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What we ayme at in theſe, not ayming at them in Chriſts ſtrength. 16. Not ayming and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring conſtantly to walk with God, and keep commuuion with him in all duties, that we may have the more acceſs to communion with him in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. 17. Not laying aſide of rooted prejudices and ſecret malice. Nor 18. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing ſuch whom we know to lye under any offence of that kind, that they may repent and reform. 19. Unſtayedneſs in our ayming at commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

               <p>Secondly. In our going about this Ordinance, there are many faults that uſually concur: As 1, Our giving too little reſpect, or too much to it, as is ſaid before of the Sacraments in general. 2. Our not exerciſing Faith in the preſent time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant and Chriſts Inſtitution. 3. Want of Love to conſtrain us, and want of that Hunger and Thirſt that ſhould be after Chriſt. 4. Want of that diſcerning of the Lords Body, which ſhould be, ſo as, 1. To put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, and common Bread and Wine in reſpect of the end. 2. To put a difference betwixt this Ordinance, and Chriſt himſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

then to be no Sacrament, as it is in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Ceremonies, ſinfully deviſed by men, are mixed and added beſides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Chriſts Inſtitution. The firſt everteth the Nature of the Sacrament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and its hence-forth no more a Sacrament. The ſecond poyſoneth it, ſo that it may not be received without partaking of that ſin actively.</p>
               <p>There is another way of polluting the Sacrament, that is Extrinſick and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, not in Eſſentials, but in ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> uſe making of it; and the Application thereof beyond Chriſts Warrant, as when it is Adminiſtred to one upon whom Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth it not. In that caſe it is not a Sacrament to that perſon; yet it is ſo in it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell. This Pollution is a prophaning of it to us, or a making it common. Thus the Word of Promiſe generally applyed in a Congregation without ſeparation, in Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, betwixt the Precious and the Vile, is a prophaning of the Word, (for the word of Promiſe ſhould not be made common more then the Sacrament,) as it is marked, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. verſe 26. <hi>The Priests have prophaned my Holy Name, they have put no Difference between the Holy and the Prophane, between the Clean and the Unclean.</hi> Yet in that caſe, the Word ceaſeth not to be Gods Word, though it be ſo abuſed: Or, As an Admonition caſt before a Prophane Mocker, is but the abuſing of an Holy thing, yet it altereth not the Nature of it; as a Pearl caſt before a Sow, is pudled and abuſed, yet it doth not alter its inward Nature, but it ſtill remaineth a Pearl: So it is here in the Word and Sacraments; they are abuſed in their uſe when miſ-applyed, yet ſtill (the Inſtitution being kept) they are the Ordinances of God: Thus was the Temple ſaid to be prophaned, when it was made more common in its uſe then was allowed; yet was it ſtill the Temple of the Lord: And ſo admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſcandalous perſons may thus be called, a polluting of the Sacraments, but not eſſentially in themſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider Pollution with reference to perſons who are admitted; and ſo the Sacraments may be polluted. 1. By groſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly. As to the Office-Bearers, who are the admitters, the Sacrament can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prophaned Eſſentially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Inſtitution being kept pure; yet may they ſin, and be guilty of prophaning it, by opening the Door wider then Chriſt has allowed, and not keeping the right bounds: And Miniſters may ſo ſin, in promiſcuous applying of the Promiſes and Conſolations of the Covenant, as well as in applying its Seals, and both theſe are ſins to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet theſe caſes would be excepted.</p>

It is hard to think, a Communion is celebrated, but there is one or more who ſhould not be admitted, and the admiſſion of one or two, as well as of many is a prophaning of the Ordinance: yea, if we thought them to be ſcandalous; yea, if we knew them not to be holy, we could not in Faith communicate with them, left the Ordinance be defiled by us, if their defiling were ours.</p>

               <p>The laſt thing in which we shall inſtance the breath of this Command, is in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the duty of Faſting; concerning which we would take notice of two things: 1. That Faſting is a ſolemn piece of external religious worship, when rightly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly diſcharged. 2. That men may be guilty of many ſins as to their practiſe in reference thereto.</p>
               <p>Firſt: That it is a piece of external worship, is clear. 1. From Precepts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it. 2. From the practiſes and examples of the Saints in Scripture. 3. From Scripture-directions given to regulate us in it; yet it differeth from Prayer and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 1. That thoſe are ordinary pieces of Worship, but this is extraordinary, proceeding from ſpecial occaſions, either of a Croſs lying on, or 2. Feared and immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; 3. or ſome great thing which we are to Suit for, or ſuch like. Although it be an extraordinary piece of Worship; yet the more holy we read any to have been, we find they have been the more in this duty of Faſting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are to conſider that Faſting is not of it ſelf a piece of immediate Worship, as Prayer, &amp;c. but medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>e only as it is made uſe of to be helpful to ſome other duty, ſuch as Praying humbling of our ſelves, Mortification, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Again, 3. Faſting may be conſidered in four reſpects: 1. As it is gone about i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> ſecret, by one ſingle perſon ſetting himſelf a part for Prayer, and for Faſting to that end; many inſtances whereof are in Scripture. 2. As its private, or a little more pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick, being gone about by a Family, or ſome few perſons joyning together, as <hi>Eſther</hi> and her Maids. 3. As it is publick, being performed by a Congregation, as <hi>Acts</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:31633:51"/>
13. 2, 3. 4. As gone about by a whole national Church: Theſe four are all mentioned, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 11. 12. where we find, 1. the whole Land. 2. Families together. 3. Families a-part. 4. Particular Perſons or Wives a-part, ſetting about this duty.</p>

                  </gap> is to be minded in a ſpecial way for helping us againſt ſpiritual evils, caſting out of Devils, mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Luſts, as alſo under ſad temporal Croſſes and Loſſes <hi>Math.</hi> 17. 21. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9 ult.</p>
               <p>Next, as there are ſome times and caſes in all theſe which call for Faſting with Prayer to be ſeriouſly gone about; ſo we may ſin in reference to this duty many ways: As 1. When it is ſlighted, and not gone about at all; and thus men are guilty either 1. By contemning it, or 2 Counting it not neceſſary; or 3. By negligence, ſo that we will not be at pains to ſtir up our ſelves to a frame for it: Or 4. Will not leave our pleaſures or work for it. 5. In not eſteeming highly of it. 6. In not labouring to have fit opportunities to go about it. 7. In ſcarring at it as a burden. 8. In caſting it up as Hypocriſie to others, and mocking at it in them. 9 In not joyning in our affection with others we know are Faſting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. In our unfrequent uſe of it. 11. In neglecting cauſes that relate to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick, or to others; contenting our ſelves with what relateth to our own neceſſity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12. In not being affected with our neglect of that duty, nor mourning for it, and repenting of it, nor being humbled under the many evils which the neglecting of it carryeth along with it. 13. At leaſt neglecting on part or other of this duty of Faſting. 14. Not ſetting our ſelves ſeriouſly to be at the end deſigned in Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which maketh us either neglect it, or go formally about it</p>
               <p>In going about this duty of Faſting, there are two Evils to be avoyded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The 1. is, giving too much to it, as if it did merit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 1. or as if it ſelf did mortifie ſin, or make holy, or were Religious worſhip in it ſelf: The 2. is one the other hand, when it getteth too little, being looked on as not neceſſary or profitable for the framing of ones ſpirit, and fitting them for Prayer, ſelf-examination or wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God, and not accounted a fit mean for that end, more than when it is neglected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>In ſpeaking of the ſins we are guilty of, as to this duty, we are to conſider more particularly how we ſin before it in our preparation to it. 2. In our going about it. 3. When it is ended</p>
               <p>And firſt, before our going about it, we ſin 1. When the right end of a Faſt is miſtaken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is not conſidered as a mean to help us to a more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual frame. 2. When we do not ſtudy to be clear in, and to conſider the ſpecial grounds that call us to it, not ayming to have our heart from conviction affected ſutably with them. 3. When we are not put to it from the right motive, but go about it ſelfily, to be ſeen of men; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 16. or for the faſhion. 4. When its not gone about in obedience to a command of God, and ſo we Faſt to our ſelves. <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. 5. 5 When there is no ſecret examination of our own hearts, to try what frame we are in, what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uſts reign in us, or prevail over us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any particular dealing with God before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hand to be enabled for this duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and helped in it, and that both for our ſelves and others. 7. When we are not endeavouring to be in good terms with God, and ſtudying to be clear as to that, before we come to put up ſuits to him. 8. When we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect Chriſt, and turn legal in it. 9. When we do not ſeparate our ſelves from all other affairs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

When we do not (if it be ſecret) labour to be unſeen in it to any. 12. Not ſetting our ſelves ſeriouſly to it. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 3. abſtracting our ſelves from diverſions, and rouſing up our ſelves for it.</p>
               <p>Secondly. In the time of Faſting, we ſin. Firſt, By Eating unneceſſarily, though it be little: as we may ſin by not eating, when not eating diſableth us in Duties; yet the Body ought to be in ſuch a meaſure affected, as may uot hinder us in Prayer; but many ſcarce ſuffer it to be touched, or in the leaſt meaſure affected, or afflicted with Abſtinence. 2. In Lightneſs of Apparel, or ſuch fineneſs in it, as they make uſe of on other dayes. 3. In Geſtures, looking light, like Laughing, and in ſuch a carriage, as is very unſuitable for that day. 4. In Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, there being a more ſeeming weightedneſs and heavineſs, then really there is. 5. In having wrong ends before us. As firſt, To ſeem holy. 2. To carry on ſome Temporal or Politick Deſign, as <hi>Jezabel</hi> did againſt <hi>Naboth</hi> to get his Vineyard. 3. To get advantage of ſome other, and to make ſome finiſter Deſigns, digeſt, and go down the better, as Iſaiah 58. verſe 4. <hi>To ſmite with the Fiſt of wickedneſs,</hi> as <hi>under pretence of Long Prayers,</hi> to take the more Liberty to injure others. 4. For Strife and Debate, and ſtrengthening of Factions and Parties. 6. We ſin here by neglecting Works of Mercy. 7. By taking pains in Works Lawful on others dayes, <hi>Exacting all our Labour,</hi> or a part of it, which is unbecoming on that day. 8. By taking delight in Temporal things, finding our own pleaſures. 9. By words or thoughts of Lawful things, diverting us from the Work of the day. 10. By wearying of it as a burden; <hi>Not calling it a Delight.</hi> 11. By wiſhing it were over, that we might be at our work or paſtime again, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5. 12. By negligence in Prayer, or not being frequent and fervent in it, nor pertinent to that day, and the end of it; for there ſhould be in all theſe ſomething on a Faſt-day ſuitable to it; and which is called for on that day, more then on other dayes. 13. By not joyning ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly with others, when they pray, eſpecially in particulars which concern others. 14. By little Mourning or Heart-melting, eſpecially in ſecret Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which on that day would be more frequent, more ſerious, and affecting, then on other dayes, that day being ſet apart for it: And if private, we ſhould be more abſtracted, even from ordinary Refreſhments and Mirth, then upon a Sabbath: and the frame of the Heart, would be then more humble, mournful, and denyed to otherwiſe-Lawful Comforts. 15. By little of the Exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance or ſenſe of Sin, that day for humbling the Heart in the ſenſe of our own Vileneſs, and loathing of our ſelves. 16. By little ſuitable uptaking of God in his Holyneſs, Diſpleaſure againſt Sin, &amp;c, Which on that day, is in an eſpecial way called for. 17. By not diſtinct Covenant with him, and ingaging to him againſt our ſeen Evils and Defects; a Faſt-day, would be a Covenanting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, as we ſee in <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> 18. By being defective in Reading
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:31633:52"/>
and Meditating on what may humble us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but much more when by Looks, Words, or Thoughts, we marr the right frame, and ſet of our Hearts. 19. By Reſting on Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, or being Legal in it. 20. By not minding the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Thirdly. We ſin after faſting. 1. Soon returning to other thoughts. 2. Letting any frame we had attained, ſlack and wear out. 3. Forgetting our Confeſſions and Engagements, and falling to former Sins, and neglecting theſe Duties to which we have engaged, 4. Being rigid with others, we have to do with. 5. Not inſiſting in Prayer, for thoſe things we aimed at in faſting. 6. Not trying and obſerving if any thing we prayed for hath been obtained. 7. Not Reflecting upon our carriage in it, that we may know how it was diſcharged. 8. Not humbled under our many short-comings, and failings in it. 9. Glad when it was done, becauſe that Reſtraint is taken off our carnal Humours. 10. Sitting down and reſting on that we have done, as if all were done. 11. Thinking our ſelves ſomething better, by our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward performance. 12. Being vain of it, if it be well to our Senſe. 13. Being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchful after it, and not ſtudying ſuitableneſs in our following carriage, ſo that it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe Particulars applyed to our own Hearts, may be uſeful for our Conviction, and Humiliation. Ah! Who can ſay, I am clean? All of us are guilty, either by neglecting ſuch Duties, or by thus and thus going about them unſuitably: from theſe Sins, we may read alſo the contrary Duties, or Qualifications, that are required for the right diſcharge of theſe Duties. The preventing of theſe Sins, will bring in the Duties called for, and the right manner of going about them. Otherwiſe, the going about theſe Duties, without the manner requiſite, is but as it were the making of ſome Image, for our ſelves in the Lords worship, which he has not commanded, and ſo he may ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Is it ſuch a Faſt that I have choſen?</hi> Iſai. 58. 5. or, Is it ſuch a Prayer I called for; and, <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your hands?</hi> Iſai. 1. 12. Theſe Queſtions, which the Lord putteth to our Conſcience, will make many Prayers, and Praiſes, and much worship, that now ſeemeth to be in great Bings or Heaps, come down to a ſmall bulk, when they are thus fanned, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We come now to the manner how this Command is preſſed, which is. Firſt, By a Reaſon. Secondly, By a Commination. Thirdly, By a Promiſe. All which ſpeak a readineſs in men to fail in this Command, and a ſpecial notice that God taketh of the Duties required in it, and of the Sins forbidden in it. Men might readily ſay; What needeth ſo much Rigidity in the manner of worship? and, If it be to the true God, though it have in it ſome mixture of thoſe things, which have been formerly abuſed, it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> much to be ſtood upon: The Lord therefore in preſſing it, addeth this Reaſon, <hi>I am a jealous God,</hi> (ſaith he) that will not only have my Church and Spouſe, Honeſt and Chaſt indeed, but Chaſt-like: As <hi>Caſar</hi> ſaid, His Wife behoved, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A Facility or Aptneſs, as it were to ſuſpect any thing which may look like a giving that to any other, which is due to God: So a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is ſaid to be jealous, when he is apt to ſuſpect want of Love in his Wife, and is

ready to gather from every Circumſtance, her inclination to another; even though there be no palpably Demonſtrative ground of it. Thus jealouſie is taken amongſt Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It importeth a ſevere Indignation, againſt every thing which giveth ground of ſuſpition; it cannot abide that: Hence jealouſie is called, <hi>The Rage of a Man,</hi> Prov. 6. 38. This Wrong will not be endured, when many others will be diſpenſed with. Any thing that ſeemingly ſlighteth him, or inclineth the Heart to another, is to jealouſie inſufferable. Theſe two, after the manner of men (as many other things) are applyed to God, to shew that he will not admit, that which is ſuſpicious-like in his ſervice; but if his People depart from him in deviating in the leaſt from the Rule given, He will be provoked to be avenged on them for it. This is the force of the Reaſon: The Commination or Threatning added, confirmeth this; it is in theſe Words, <hi>Viſiting the Iniquities of the Fathers on the Children.</hi> To <hi>Viſit</hi> here, is, To pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Children, for the Fathers faults; though God should ſeem for the time to forget the Breaches of this Command, and not to take notice of Corruptions intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by men in his worship; yet, ſaith he, <hi>I will Viſit,</hi> or revenge that Iniquity, not only upon the preſent Race, but upon the following, even <hi>upon the third and fourth Gen<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>For clearing this, let us ſee. Firſt, What is the Punishment here threatned? 2. On whom it is? Upon the Children of them that tranſgreſs this Command. 3. How it is executed? 4. Why the Lord doth ſo? That we may vindicate this place, and clear it from appearance of Contradiction, with that in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18. Where it is ſaid, <hi>The Son shall not lear the Iniquity of his Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Firſt Queſtion then; is, What it is that is here Threatned? <hi>Anſw.</hi> We do not think that this place ſpeaketh only of Temporal Punishments, and that of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> of Eternal: For the ſcope of both, will contradict this; for that paſſage <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. is occaſioned from the People preſent ſtraits, and ſpeaketh directly of Temporal Judgements; ſo, that Diſtinction will not clear this ſeeming Contradiction. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we conceive here to be underſtood mainly Spiritual and Eternal Evils, which God threatneth to the Children of Wicked Parents. (For, that Temporal Judgements follow them, and are included in the Threatning there is no queſtion.)</p>
               <p>This will be clear. Firſt, By conſidering that the thing threatned here, is, that punishment which the Breach of, or Iniquity committed againſt this Command, or other Commands, deſerveth: yea, it is the punishment, that ſinful Parents deſerve, he <hi>Viſiteth the Iniquities of the Fath<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. The ſcope may clear it, which is, To reſtrain Parents, from the ſins here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; becauſe by ſuch ſins they bring Wrath, not only on themſelves, but on their Poſterity after them, even when they are gone, as ye have it <hi>Jerem.</hi> 32. 18.

Now ordinarily the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wicked men in outward things, thrive beſt unto the third and fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and after that come their temporal Judgement; therefore it cannot be that, which is here only, or Principally, meaned.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider <hi>Cain, Ham,</hi> &amp;c. upon whoſe Poſterity, this Curſe was peculiarly derived, and there you will find ſomewhat more then what is Temporal.</p>
               <p>The Second thing to be cleared here, is, the Party threatned to be thus puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: It is not the Fathers that are expreſſed, but the Children after them, as it is <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 18. All is fore-faulted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the whole Stock, and Family. Concerning which, let us take theſe three Conſiderations along with us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That theſe Children puniſhed, are not innocent in themſelves, but being guilty before the Lord by Original Corruption; or by both it and Actual Sin, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelves lyable to ſuch Plagues; they have no reaſon to ſay, <hi>The Fathers have eaten ſour Grapes; and the Childrens Teeth are ſet on edge:</hi> For whether the Judgements be Temporal or Spiritual, the Children have deſerved them, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay they are wronged. And this Conſideration reconcileth this place, with that of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where God putteth them to it, thus: None Innocent are plagued; but ye are plagued: therefore ſaith he, Read your own ſin out of your Plagues.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, that the Threatning againſt Children of ſuch Parents, is here limited to the third or fourth generation; all their Poſterity is not curſed thereby. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gods kindneſs is ſuch, as to leave a Door open for Penitents. All fell in <hi>Adam,</hi> yet Mercy opened a Door of Hope to ſinful Man: And ſurely the Threatnings of this new Covenant, are not ſo peremptory, as to ſhut the Door of <hi>Mercy upon Sinners.</hi> 2. The third and fourth generation are eſpecially threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe theſe are neareſt the Parent, and have moſt of his Nature in them; he knoweth them beſt; and often he may live to ſee theſe: Therefore the Lord threatneth theſe, that it may moſt affect Parents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it being for the ſecond, third, and fourth generation, that they moſt ordinarily travel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, that in this Threatning, (as alſo in the Promiſe following) God doth not give or lay down a conſtant Rule, to which he will be tyed, as if he could not do otherwiſe at any time; For to ſay that, were Derogatory to his Election, and the Soveraignty of his Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore that is not the Scope: But here he giveth a Declaration of what uſually, and ordinarily he doth, and what men, if he deal with them in Juſtice, may expect from Him: Yet it is ſtill ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as the Son of a wicked Perſon, may be found to be an Elect, and the Son of a Godly Perſon rejected: that he may continue his Plagues longer then the third or fourth Generation, or break them off ſooner when he thinketh good: For though by this, He would reſtrain Parents from ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet hath he a Door open to many ſuch Children for mercy; even as the contrary promiſe hath many exceptions as to the Children of Godly Parents, that walk not in the paths of their Parents going before them, as many known inſtances of both, in Scripture, do make out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:31633:53"/>
The third Queſtion is, How God doth execute this threatning? or, How he doth reach Children with eternal plagues for their Parants ſins?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He doth it certainly, and he doth it Juſtly: therefore the Children muſt not only be conſidered as guilty, but as guilty of the ſins of their Parents, which we may thus co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ceive; 1. As to the Child of a wicked Parent, lying in natural Corruption, God denyeth and with holdeth his renewing and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace which he is not obliged to confer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Lord in this may reſpect the Parents guilt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Juſtly. 2. When grace is denyed, then followeth the temptation of the Parents practiſe, the Devil ſtirring up, to the like ſin, and they furthering their Children to wickedneſs by their example, advice authority, &amp;c. So that it cometh to paſs in Gods juſtice, that they are given up to vent their natural corruption in theſe ways, and ſo come as it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 13. to approve their Parents ſayings. 3. Upon this followeth God's caſting the Child, now guilty of his Parents faults, into eternal Perdition with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that this is the meaning of the threatning, will appear by the examples of Gods juſtice in this matter, when wicked Parents have Children that are not ſo much miſerable in regard of temporal things, as they are wicked, curſed, and plagued with Ungodlineſs; ſo was <hi>Cains</hi> Children, ſo were the Children of <hi>Cham,</hi> and ſo were <hi>Eſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If it be asked, Why God thus plagueth and threatneth the Children of wicked Parents? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. God doth it to make ſin hateful, ſeeing it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth often a forfeiture of ſpiritual bleſſings, yea, of bleſſings of all ſorts, upon whole Generations and Families<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. To ſtrike the more terrour into others, who by this may be ſcared from ſin, and made to ſtand in awe of God, who is ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to put a mark of Infamy on the race and poſterity of his Enemies. 3. The more to effect and weight the Sinner; it is a part of his puniſhmen to know that by his ſin he has not only made himſelf miſerable, but all his Poſterity: And theſe may be the Reaſons, why, as it were by the light of nature, all Nations in ſome caſes are led not only to puniſh the perſons of ſome Malefactors, but to fore fault, and put a note of Infamy on their Poſterity, for ſome kind of faults<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Gods greatneſs, that men may know how ſoveraign he is; and how, Treaſon againſt the moſt high is to be accounted of. 5. It is to commend holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the neceſſity of it, to God's people, and to put them to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Children, in God, and a good Conſcience, rather then in all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral riches.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſame Queſtions and Anſwers may ſerve to clear what concerneth the Promiſe alſo, they being ſuitably applyed to it.</p>
               <p>It is further to be obſerved that the Lord expreſſeth wicked men under that notion, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

it; therefore, they muſt hate God, who giveth contrary Commands: and ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Sinners wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h that there were not ſuch Commands. Again, he expreſſeth the Godly in the Promiſe, under theſe two deſignations. 1. <hi>Thoſe that love me,</hi> that is the inward Fountain and comprehenſive ſum of all duties. 2. <hi>Thoſe that keep my Comm ndments,</hi> that looketh to the outward effects of Love, and is the proofo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it, ſo that there is no mid's betwixt theſe two, to love God, and keep his Commandments, and to hate him, and ſlight, or break his Commandments, and ſo no mid's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Gods gracious promiſe to Parents and Children, and his Curſe on both.</p>
               <p>Laſtly: It would be in a particular way obſerved, that though every ſin hath ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to God in it, yet he putteth this name of hating him, in a ſpecial way upon the ſin of corrupting his Worſhip and Service, to shew that there is a ſpecial enmity againſt God in that ſin, and that it is in a ſpecial way hateful to him; as upon the other hand he taketh Zeal for the purity of his Worſhip, as a ſingular evidence of love to him.</p>
               <p>Let us cloſe this Command with ſome words of uſe; and 1. Ye may ſee what good or evil to us and ours, and that eternally, there is in Diſobedience or in Holineſs: O Parents! what mercy is it to you, your ſelves, and to your Children that you be Godly? Alace, this Curſe here threatned, is too palpable upon many Children, who are curſed with profanity from the Womb upward: Why do you that are Parents wrong your poor Infants? and why neglect ye that which is beſt for them? Here alſo there is matter of much comfort to Parents fearing God; this Promiſe is a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding portion to a thouſand Generations, which though it be not peremptory, as to all individual perſons; yet 1. It ſecludeth none. 2. It comprehendeth many. 3. It giveth ground for us to be quiet for all our Poſterity, till they by their own carriage diſclaim that Covenant wherein this Promiſe is included. 4. It giveth Warrant for a Believer to expect that God may make up his Election amongſt his Seed rather then amongſt others: It is true, ſometimes he chooſeth ſome of the Poſterity of wicked Parents, yet oft-times the Election of Grace falleth upon the Poſterity of the Godly. 5. It is a ground upon which we may quiet our ſelves for temporal things needful to our Children; certainly theſe promiſes are not for nought, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 102. <hi>ult.</hi> 112. 2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 17.</p>

And therefore, as amongſt men, there are ſpecial crimes beyond ordinary procuring ſuch a ſentence, ſo is it here. And 1. They be guilty by following their foot-ſteps, in walking in their Parents ſins, as <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Children did. 2. In approving their Fathers way, praiſing their Fathers ſayings or doings; as it is <hi>Pſalm</hi> 49. v. 13. 3. In winking at their Parents ſins and wickedneſs. 4. In boaſting of their Oppreſſions, Blood-shed, &amp;c. as if they were

Singleneſs in the end, that it be not to deceive any, but to expreſs the truth truly and faithfully, called <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 4. 2. And for the moſt part theſe properties or qualifications may agree to Oaths, Aſſeverations and Imprecations.</p>
               <p>For the further clearing of this matter, we would ſpeak to ſome queſtions.</p>
               <p>And the 1. Queſtion is, How then differ Oaths from Aſſeverations?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They ſhould both be in Truth and Judgment with fear, and when cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto; but in this they differ, that in Oaths we are only to make mention of the true God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſwear by him, but Aſſeverations may be thus expreſſed, <hi>As thy Soul liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A2d. <hi>Question</hi> is, What may we Judge of ſuch Oathes, as are By Angels, Saints, <hi>Mary, Paul,</hi> and <hi>By</hi> other Creatures, as Heaven, Light, the World, by Soul, Conſcience. &amp;c. Or by Graces, as by Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We need not uſe much Curioſity in Diſtinctions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, we conceive them all to be ſimply unlawful. 1. Becauſe none of theſe are God, and ſwearing is a Peculiar piece of his Worſhip, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13. And ſwearing by any thing what ever it be, which is not God, is condemned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5 7. <hi>They have ſworn by thoſe who are not Gods.</hi> 2. Becauſe we cannot invocate any of theſe, and therefore cannot ſwear by them, ſeeing an Oath carryeth along with it, an Invocation of him we ſwear by. 3. Becauſe they want theſe Properties due to ſuch, to whom this Worſhip belongeth. As 1. Omniſcience, to try whether we mean as we have ſworn or not. 2. Omnipotency. And 3. Juſtice to avenge, if it be not ſo as we have ſworn. 4. Soveraignty, to call the Swearers to a Reckoning. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would derogate from the Scope of this Command, which giveth this to God alone, as his due, and implyeth, that he alone hath all theſe Properties in him. 5. Becauſe ſuch Oathes are expreſly Prohibited by Chriſt, <hi>Matth</hi> 3. 34. <hi>Swear not at all, neither by Heaven nor Earth;</hi> For, they ſtand in an Inferiour Relation to God, and are his Servants. 6.

We think, there is no Queſtion, but if theſe were rightily, and in the due manner made uſe of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they might be lawfully uſed, as Scripture cleareth. 2. Yea, we think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If any Oaths be made uſe of, theſe would firſt be uſed; and a man may be called to uſe one of theſe, when he is not, directly to ſwear. 3. Therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we think they cannot be uſed, but in neceſſity when leſs will not ſerve, and ſhould be uſed with Fear, Reverence, Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the other Qualifications: And that therefore they ſin, who in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Diſcourſe, raſhly and vainly uſe them, which we conceive to be forbidden here; and when they are not Conſcientiouſly uſed, they lead men to a greater Degree of the ſin, here diſcharged: as we ſee ſome begin with Aſſeverations, then idle Oaths; and then Imprecations, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſinfully did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. Reaſon 1. All theſe Aſſeverations are reductively Oaths, and imply the contrary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations in them. Thus, Let me not be eſteemed a Chriſtian, nor have a Soul to be ſaved; which muſt relate to God for executing theſe; therefore, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct Oaths, they ought to be uſed as Oaths, and belong to this Command. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the very end of any vehement Aſſeveration, is to confirm what is ſaid, further, then an ordinary Aſſertion can: Now in ſo far, it is an Oath; it being proper to an Oath, to confirm what is ſpoken, and ſeeing it agreeth with an Oath in the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls, they muſt be materially one, though Aſſeverations, be pronounced in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Form. 3. Vain Aſſeverations, are againſt that Rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5 37. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Let your Communication be Yea, Yea, and Nay, Nay, and what-ever is more</hi> (i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ordinary Communication) <hi>is Evil:</hi> And it cannot be denyed but this is more, and therefore needleſs and ſinful. 4. We do not find Aſſeverations, ſuch as <hi>My Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience beareth me witneſſe,</hi> to be uſed (warrantably) by Saints in Scripture; but with great Reverence, even almoſt in ſuch things as they uſed to confirm by Oaths; therefore Swearing is often joyned with them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1. 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31. 5.

Yea, would he not be thought Infamous in breaking his Good Faith? Therefore it is more then Yea or Nay, and ſo not ordinarily to be uſed. Yea, we conceive that theſe Aſſeverations will have more weight on Natural Conſciences, than ſimple Aſſertions; and therefore the Challenges of dealing Falſly in theſe, will bite and and wound the Conſcience, much more ſharply than falſifying ſimple Aſſertions, which ſpeaketh out this; that they are nearer of kin unto, and more involved i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The 4. <hi>Question</hi> is, What may be ſaid of Imprecations? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Diſtinguiſh betwixt ſuch as one uſeth againſt himſelf; as, <hi>Let me not ſee Heaven i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that be not Truth,</hi> or the like. 2. Such as are uſed againſt others, (I ſpeak by private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,) as, <hi>Shame fall thee, Divil take thee,</hi> and the like; which are either Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, as, If thou do not ſuch a thing, &amp;c. or abſolute, without any ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. We ſay then, 1. That keeping the Qualifications, formerly mentioned, and required to an Oath; one may in ſome caſes lawfully uſe ſome Imprecations, even to ones ſelf, the Scriptures having ſuch Patterns in them; but with great Caution, Circumſpection, and Tenderneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Curſing of others by private Perſons, out of Paſſion or Revengs, is ſimply prohibited, and that is ſeveral Reſpects. For 1. It derogateth from the Glory of God, if He be therein invocated in making Him ſubſervient to our Paſſions, and to Execute our Revenge; or if He be not Invocated in theſe Imprecations; it's worſe, becauſe the Devil, or ſome other thing is put in His room<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. It deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth alſo from that love we owe to others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As mentioning the Devil in ſuch Imprecations, as <hi>Devil a bit,</hi> or <hi>Fiend, a Body,</hi> or ſuch like, it is moſt Abominable: For thereby the Devil is employed in Gods Room, and God is forſaken; becauſe there is no ground to exſpect a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch a Suit from Him, and ſo you betake you to the Devil, praying him, employing him, reverencing and worſhipping him; as if he were juſt, to Executer your Judgement, when God doth it not: And ſometimes by ſuch Imprecations; you call on the Devil who is the Father of Lyes, to witneſſe a Truth. Ah! How Ahominable to be heard amongſt Chriſtians! Men need not go to the <hi>Wild-Indians,</hi> nor to Witches, to ſeek Worſhippers of the Devil! Alas! There are many ſuch to be found amongſt Chriſtians! How ſound theſe Words? What Devil now! The Meckle Devil, &amp;c.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is Horrible to mention, that which goeth out of ſome Mens mouths without any fear! What can be the Reaſon that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians thus Worſhip the Devil, and ſwear by him, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did by <hi>Baal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There remain yet ſome things concerning Oaths, eſpecially Promiſſy Oaths to be cleared. As 1. How Promiſſory oaths differ from an Aſſertory Oath.</p>
               <p>And 1. They agree in this, that Truth is the Scope of both. But. 2, They differ in this, that Aſſertatory Oaths, have but one Verity, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the thing be, in the Preſent time, true as the man ſayeth or ſweareth: But Promiſſory Oaths have a Twofold Verity, to wit; One preſent, that the Swearer meaneth what he promiſeth. 2. That for the time to come he ſhall endeavour, effectually to make the thing Truth which he ſayeth and ſweareth: The Firſt is only a Truth in the Perſon; The Second is alſo a Truth of the Thing or Matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We would difference Vowes from Promiſſory Oaths. Vows have God both for Party and Witneſs. Oaths may have ſome other for Party, but God for Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to the giving an Oath or Promiſe to ſuch a Party: Yet in ſome things there is a great Affinity, as to the matter, in both.</p>
               <p>Concerning Promiſſory Oathes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may enquire. 1. Concerning the making of them. 2. Concerning the Obligation of them; That a Man may make ſuch Oaths tying himſelf to ſome things in which he was before free; is without all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and clear in the Scripture. Concerning ſuch Oaths, it may be enquired. 1. In what Matter. 2. On what Occaſions. 3. With what Conditions, they may be engagedin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:31633:58"/>
And 1. For the matter of them; they may be in three ſorts of Matter. 1. In ſuch matter as is Morally neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Fearing, Serving, Worſhipping the true God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. So was <hi>Jacobs</hi> Oath and Vow, Geneſ. 28. 20, 21. <hi>That the Lord ſhould be his God.</hi> And many of the Covenants mentioned in the Old Teſtament; and <hi>Davids</hi> ſwearing, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 106. <hi>To keep Gods Statutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a Civil lawful good Matter; ſuch as Duties to Superiours, or to make ſome Obligation we owe to others forth-coming; or to return and requite ſuch a particular good turn to one. Such are Oaths of Allegiance to lawful Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours: Such did the Spies ſwear to <hi>Rachab, Joſhua</hi> 2. 12, &amp;c. And <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Jonathan:</hi> and that theſe are Lawful, having due Qualifications, cannot be denyed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are ſomethings indifferent; as Eating, or abſtaining from ſuch and ſuch Meats or Drinks, or on ſuch and ſuch dayes: and although the thing be not ſimply unlawful, yet Oaths therein would be engaged in, with much Prudence, on ſuch Grounds, and with ſuch Qualifications and Conditions, as may make it appear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Swearer is not uſing the Name of God unneceſſarily, and that he cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gain his Point: Nor ſuperſtitiouſly to make it appear, that he doth not bring his Conſcience under a Yoak of Will-worſhip. One of which wayes ordinarily men fail, in theſe Oaths; and ſo they are neither to Gods Honour, nor others good: and therefore ſuch Oaths are either rarely to be ingaged in, or not at all.</p>
               <p>Next, ſuch Oaths as to the occaſions of parties ingaging in them, may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into theſe three.</p>
               <p>The 1. is, When we ingage in Publick Oaths and Promiſes ſolemnly, when Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority calleth us to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Edification or Satisfaction of another in private calleth for it. There are ſometimes when a Chriſtian may be; Yea, is called to it, for gaining Credit to ſomething, (that the other is called to believe) to interpoſe reverently the Oath of God, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did to <hi>Laban.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. One in ſecret may thus ingage himſelf to God, in Lawful and neceſſary things; As <hi>David, I have ſworn, that I will keep thy righteous judgements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet in the third place, all theſe Oaths, would ſtill be with theſe Qualifications, mentioned <hi>Jerem.</hi> 4. 2. Firſt, in Truth, namely, the two-fold Truth before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. 2. In <hi>Judgement,</hi> that is, with Knowledge and Deliberation, minding and underſtanding what it is we ſwear. 3. With righteouſneſs or juſtice, that is, That it be in things, that are according to the Law of Equity, as well as Piety, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wronging God, nor others by our Oaths; for Oaths are in themſelves ſtill, <hi>Vincula <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There are alſo to be obſerved theſe Tacite or Expreſs Conditions in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory Oaths, (and ſometimes it is fit to expreſs them, and ſometimes not;) <hi>If God will,</hi> and if nothing intervene to hinder, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. <hi>If I live,</hi> and health permit. As much as in them lyeth, they ſhall aim at it, if ſome impoſſibility intervene not. 3. So far as the fulfilling of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall be Lawful; for it can onely tye to Lawful things, and Lawful means and courſes; and this is eſpecially to be underſtood of Indefinite Oaths. 4, While things ſtand ſo; but if the Caſe alter Eſſentially, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:31633:58"/>
men turn Enemies to the Kingdome or Common-wealth, to whom we were by Oath obliged, to give or ſell ſome-what that we know would be made uſe of, to the Probable ruine or hazard thereof; then its not in our power, <hi>Salvâ potestate ſuperioris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be asked, How we ſhall judge of Indefinite Oaths; ſuch as Souldiers give to their Officers, to be obedient to them; or of Oaths in things which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct, and the matter not obvious, as Oaths in Colledges, Incorporations, Towns, &amp;c. Where the things ſworn are Complex.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe cannot altogether be condemned. 1. Becauſe though a man have not, yea cannot have, a particular and diſtinct knowledge of all Particulars; yet he underſtandeth ſuch Oaths, as binding to all neceſſary and lawful things, as the general Condition requireth. 2. Becauſe he taketh the Oath for the end, and in the ſenſe, that it is Commonly taken, which bindeth in the Eſſential things, pertaining to the being of that Incorporation, but taketh not in, every particular ſtrictly.</p>
               <p>By what is ſaid, then: We may, 1. Condemn Oaths in Trivial things, as Oaths in Complements; when men ſwear they will not go one before an other. That men are wellcome to their Houſes: That they will not let them go ſo ſoon: That they ſhall drink ſo much, though it may not be to Exceſs: That they ſhall return ſome petty thing they have borrowed, and the like. 2. Raſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, ſuch as are haſtily and unadviſedly or doubtingly made. But ere we come to Particulars; let us conſider what is condemned as <hi>Perjury,</hi> which is the higheſt Degree.</p>
               <p>There are theſe ſeveral ſorts of Perjury mentioned; ſome whereof are more direct and immediate; ſome more mediate and indirect.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſort of Perjury is: When one upon Oath aſſerteth as a Truth, that which he knoweth is not a Truth, or doubteth of it: or is miſtaken in it, through his own negligence, not being certain that it is as he ſayeth, whether he affirm or deny: Thus <hi>Naboths</hi> falſe witneſſes were guilty; and many other Inſtances may be adduced.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is: When one promiſeth ſomething<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he mindeth not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and confirmeth that with an Oath; he is no doubt Perjured, becauſe there is not a correſpondent verity betwixt his Oath and his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The third is: When men promiſe and intend for the time to perform<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet, upon no juſt ground, fail afterwards in performing what they have ſworn. This is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, becauſe there is not Truth in fulfilling the thing ſworn, according to the Oath, Theſe are direct Perjuries.</p>
               <p>More largely again, a man may be ſaid to forſwear himſelf. 1. When he ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to perform a thing, which is ſimply impoſſible; eſpecially while he knoweth it to be ſo: For as the former is not a ſwearing in Judgement and Truth; ſo this is a prophane and wicked ſwearing, againſt Light and Judgement, of a manifeſt lye and falſhood: So that betwixt his Promiſe to perform ſuch a thing, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, there is implyed a Contradiction. As for one to ſwear, to be to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at <hi>Rome,</hi> who is to day at <hi>Glaſgow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the very ſwearing is forſwearing. 2. When one ſweareth an unlawful or wicked thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or confirmeth it with an Oath; like thoſe forty that ſwore to kill <hi>Paul;</hi> eſpecially if that Oath be contrary to ſome
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:31633:59"/>
Duty which lyeth formerly by Oath on the Perſon ſwearing: For, that is not to ſwear in Righteouſneſs and Juſtice: Beſide, that it draweth on a neceſſity, either of breaking that Oath, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o of being perjured, or of going on to fulfill it; and ſo of being doubly perjured. 3. Men are forſworn and perjured, when they fulfill a wicked Oath, as <hi>Herod</hi> did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14 in beheading <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> for, though he ſeemed not to over-turn, and make void his own Oath, but to keep it: Yet this (as alſo the former) over-turneth and maketh void, the ſcope and Nature of an Oath in general, and is a plain Contradiction to it, and maketh an Oath, which ſhould be <hi>Vinculum Aequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tatis,</hi> a Bond of Equity: (there being <hi>Nulla Obligation</hi> but <hi>ad Officium,</hi> no Obligation but to Duty,) to be <hi>Vinculum Iniquitatis,</hi> a Bond of Iniquity: And ſo thwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>teth with the very end wherefore ſuch Oaths are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In which reſpect <hi>David</hi> did better in not executing his raſh Oath, but keeping the general ſcope of all Oaths, when he refuſed not to hearken to <hi>Abigails</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, even to the Non-performance of what he had ſworn.</p>
               <p>It may be Queſtioned here, Whether one man may be acceſſary to anothers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, if he conſtrain him to ſwear, of whom he hath a ſuſpition that he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear?</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Diſtinguiſh 1. The matter in which, if it be of grave Concernment, or of little Moment. 2. Diſtinguiſh, betwixt the Publickneſs and Privacy of it 3. Diſtinguiſh betwixt Parties, as betwixt a Judge, who is to decide, and a Party that is the Purſuer.</p>
               <p>We ſay then. 1. A Party purſuing, in a Particular of his own Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; eſpecially if it be of no great Concernment; may, Yea, ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear preſſing ſuch a Perſon to ſwear, both for ſparing the Party, and for reſpect to the Name of God; ſince he can hardly, in this Caſe, be very hopefull to gain by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſay, (notwithſtanding in ſome Caſes,) that the Judge may admit ſuch to ſwear, eſpecially in Publick ſcandals. 1. Becauſe none can certainly know, but God may conſtrain them to ſwear Truth. 2. Becauſe it is his way, left to decide all Controverſies; and a Judge cannot eſchew it, when it lyeth on him to put a cloſe to ſuch a Controverſie, at which he cannot win by any other means; though great Prudence is to be uſed in proceeding in ſuch a caſe, eſpecially it being of that Nature as is in Scripture appointed to be decided by Oath, as <hi>Exod,</hi> 22. 17.</p>
               <p>The great queſtion is concerning a promiſſory Oath, if in any caſe it may be made void, and ceaſe to oblige, or, in what caſes that may be?</p>
               <p>That every Oath bindeth not according to the Letter, we ſuppoſe needeth no reaſons to clear and confirm it: There are two ways in general how the obligation of an Oath promiſſory ceaſeth. 1. When the Oath it ſelf is null, and never had any obligation. 2. When by ſome other thing intervening, there is a looſing from the obligation which the Oath once had.</p>
               <p>That it may be clear that, notwithſtanding of this, Oaths are of a moſt ſtrict Obligation, having the great and dreadfull Name of God interpoſed in them; and that many things, what-ever weight be layed on them by men that way, do not looſe from it, ſuch as theſe following which we ſhall put by, in the firſt place.</p>

Perſons at their own diſpoſe muſt do even in ſuch caſes as they have bound their Souls. 3. Though we were engaged in the Oath by the deceit and guile of others, the deceit being circumſtantial only, yet if the things be not ſinful, it bindeth us, as is clear in that Oath to the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> wherein the deceit was ſuch, 4. Though by fear or violence the Oath hath been extorted, yet the matter being lawful, it bindeth becauſe of the honour of God's Name interpoſed. 5. Though it was ſinful as to the manner, and raſhly made at firſt, as that with the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> was; yet is it binding, if lawful in the matter, there being a great difference betwixt <hi>juramentum illicitum,</hi> an Oath unlawfully come under as to its manner, and <hi>jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum de Re illicitâ,</hi> an Oath in an unlawful matter. 6. Though we could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe and find out ſome interpretation or meaning of the words of the Oath that might ſeem to make forlooſing us from its obligation; yet, if that was not mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the firſt tendering of the Oath, but otherwiſe underſtood by him that did take it, it will not abſolve not excuſe from the guilt of Perjury, To put after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a new gloſs on it; becauſe an Oath is <hi>ſtricti jurts,</hi> and will not admit for any reſpect nor on any account, of interpretations prejudical to the native truth of it, leſt it ſhould be found to be, according to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. a Swearing deceitfully. 7. Though there may be a good meaning and intention in reverſing the Oath, and going croſs to it, men not doing ſo for a particular end of their own, but for a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick good as is ſupoſed; yet that will not abſolve from obligation of the Oath, nor from the guilt of Perjury, as is clear in God's puniſhing <hi>Saul's</hi> Family for breaking that Oath with the <hi>Gibeonits,</hi> even though he did it out of his Zeal to the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> as the Scripture expreſly affirmeth. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 2. 8. Though the Oath be conceived by a Creature, as at leaſt the immediate object ofit, and ſo ſinfully made in that reſpect; yet, being made, it tyeth from reſpect due to God, who ſhineth in his Creatures. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 19 20. 21. 9. Through the thing become impoſſible, if that impoſſibility might have been prevented by our ſearching our ſelves as far as in us lay, we are not freed from the guilt of Perjury, though the thing Sworn do now by onr own ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Though a ſinful Oath, to wit, being made on a ſinful promiſe, in it ſelf, bind not; yet the ſinful condition being fulfilled it bindeth; as in the caſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> his promiſing a Kid to <hi>Thamar,</hi> upon that wretched condition of proſtituting her ſelf to his ſinful Luſt, who did offer the performance of what he had engaged to, upon that moſt ſinful condition now fulfilled; for the condition being fulfilled, the promiſe is abſolute, and the ſin was not in giving the Kid, but in the condition that was made, which is paſt. 11. Much leſs will it exempt any man from the guilt of Perjury, that in Swearing he had a meaning of the words of the Oath, contrary to what in common ſenſe they bear, and in the conſtruction of all in different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb facs="tcp:31633:60"/>
or to their meaning <hi>ſine juramento</hi> or <hi>extra juramentum;</hi> or that he had any reſervation in his own mind; the firſt is, <hi>Ae</hi>quivocation; the ſecond is mental Reſervation, that have no place in ſuch an Oath which ſhould be plain; ſingle, and clear. Neither 12, will a diſpenſation from any other, as for inſtance, from the <hi>Pope,</hi> who hath no power to diſpenſe in Oaths, nor from lawful Superiours, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in things wherein by our relation to ſuch Superiours we are ſubjected to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> looſe the obligation of our Oath, nor free us from the guilt of Perjury; if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, the matter of the Oath be in things to which their power over us doth not extend, in ſuch things doubtleſs they cannot diſpenſe. 13.

               <p>But they are null. and of no force. 1. When the thing ſworn is ſinful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in it ſelf, becauſe there is <hi>nullum vinculum iniquitatis.</hi> there is not, neither can there be, any obligation to iniquity. 2. When it is unlawful to him that ſweareth, as ſuppoſe one would ſwear to do that which were incumbent for a Magiſtrate or Miniſter, he himſelf being but a meer private perſon, and it no wayes belonging to his ſtation: it tyeth him indeed to endeavour by all ſuitable means the effecting of the thing by them, but not to do it himſelf, for it altereth not ſtations. 3. When the thing is ſimply impoſſible, oaths cannot bind, in that caſe. 4. When the oath is engaged in by any, in whoſe power the thing ſworn is not, as by Children, Wives, Servants, or Subjects, in ſuch things wherein they are ſubject to others, and of which they are not Maſters; it tyeth them onely to endeavour it with their approbation or permiſſion, ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 5. When the deceit is not in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials, but in eſſentials: as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuppoſe one ſhould ſwear to ſuch another perſons to pay him ſuch a debt, or to give ſuch obedience, thinking him to be the very perſon to whom he oweth theſe things, who yet is not the perſon we ſuppoſe him to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ground of the oath is null, and its obligation accordingly ceaſeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as when <hi>Jacob</hi> was deceived by his getting <hi>Leab</hi> firſt for <hi>Rachel,</hi> becauſe ſuch an oath wrongeth another, to whom that which is ſworn is due, and ſuppoſeth the condition of being due. 6. When the oath is impeditive of a greater good, or of a moral duty; as ſuppoſe a man had ſworn not to go to ſuch a place, nor to ſpeak to ſuch a perſon. nor to eat ſuch meat; that oath (being at firſt raſh, and without judgement) if duty and neceſſity call him to the contrary of what he hath ſworn, bindeth not, becauſe a moral command may require him to go thither to take on ſuch a charge there, or to ſpeak to that perſon for his edification, &amp;c. yet this would be tenderly applyed, and with great circumſpection. 7. When the oath is interpoſed to oblige to the performance of ſome thing which hath a tendency to an ill end; as for inſtance, if a Man ſhould ſwear to meet with a woman for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting filthineſs, to give arms for helping to oppoſe an innocent, or any ſuch like thing; for though coming to ſuch a place, or giving ſuch arms may be lawful, yet as ſo circumſtantiate: this coming, and this giving of them with ſuch an intention, is nnlawful, and therefore the oath is null.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:31633:60"/>
For looſing from the obligation of an Oath which is lawful, there are theſe caſes granted. 1. When it is contradicted by a Superiour, having power in that very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 31.</p>
               <p>2. When the caſe materially altereth, as ifone ſhould ſwear to give ſuch a man arms, who afterward turneth mad, or an Enemy; to give obedience to ſuch a Commander, who afterwards becometh a private man, and ceaſeth to be any more a Commander, becauſe in ſuch caſes the relation upon which the duty and Oath is founded, ceaſeth. 3. When the party ſworn unto, relaxeth us: for though none can abſolve from a Vow, yet in a promiſſory Oath, whereby ſome right accrueth to one from another, a man may diſpenſe with his own right; as for inſtance, he may in whole, or in part, forgive and diſcharge ſuch a ſum of money that another by Oath has ſworn to give him, which when he doth, in ſo far the Oath and its obligation is looſed; he having, as himſelf thinketh fit, accepted ſatisfaction for whole or part; but in Vows to God no man can diſpenſe, He being party there. 4. When by ſome after and unforeſeen intervening Emergent, the man is quite diſabled from performing his Oath, as by ſickneſs, plundering, &amp;c. In that caſe, ſo far and ſo long as he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, in ſo far and ſo long is he looſed; that condition being neceſſarily preſuppoſed in giving the Oath at firſt, though the obligation to performance lyeth ſtill on him ſo far and ſo ſoon as he shall be able.</p>
               <p>It may be marked, by the way, that often prophane men are more ſtrict in keeping ſinful Oaths, then thoſe which are lawful: the Devil putting home that obligation on them as a ſnare, and their own corruption ſiding with the Oath in its matter, maketh it appear ſtrongly binding to them.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, Wherein it is that an Oath bindeth more then a Promiſe doth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> An Oath bindeth to nothing but what is in the Promiſe, but it bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more ſtrongly, and ſo the ſin is greater in breaking an Oath then a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; becauſe not onely our truth to men is engaged in the Oath, but our reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſpect to God alſo, and his dreadful Name thereby notably taken in vain.</p>
               <p>So then againſt this Doctrine of Oaths faileth perjury or forſwearing, rash-ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, indeliberat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſwearing, as incomplements (as for inſtance, if one should ſwear he will not drink, or go before ſuch another perſon:) Solemne Oaths entered into, at Communions, at Baptiſm, or in other lawful Covenants not performed: Ah! how often are theſe broken, even in that which we might eaſily do? We ſo carry and keep to God as men could not but quarrel; irreverent ſwearing even in what is right; groſly prophane ſwearing, as by Gods Soul, his Wounds, Blood, &amp;c. Uncouth'd, ſtrange, newly-coin'd and invented Oaths, no doubt, by ſpecial help of the Devils art, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, wherein the Devil is mentioned, and his aid implored for the execution of mens paiſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Adjurations differ thus from Oaths, that by an Oath we bind our ſelves to do or forbear ſomewhat, or to tell truth; by Adjurations we bind others by interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Name of God for commanding, charging, perſwading to do or forbear ſuch a thing, and implying, if not expreſſing ſome threatning or curſe if it be not done or forborne: There are three ſorts of theſe in Scripture, 1.

               <p>As to the 1. We ſay that men may ſometimes adjure other men in matters weighty, ſutable, and neceſſary to be done: when it is rightly gone about, and not in paſſion or for ſelf ends, but ſoberly, gravely, and ſingly, for the glory of God immediately, or mediately by anothers good being interpoſed; ſo, many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples confirm, and ſo neceſſity requireth, that when regard to men doth not ſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably weigh that ſuch a deſire be put home tothe Conſcience from reſpect to God and his Authority, who is Witneſs and will Judge: this ſome way ſifteh a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

When one of you putteth not another <hi>ſerionſly</hi> to it, to forbeare and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don fin, or to practiſe ſuch a duty, charging them, or rather obteſting them, as they will anſwer to God to do ſo, as often in the Canticles we find, <hi>I charge you, O Daughters of</hi> Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In your overly, raſh, and ſlight way of uſing obteſtations and grave intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, meerly or moſtly for the faſhion, or by way of complement, or in petty and trivial things; as when ye ſay, for God's ſake, for God's bleſſing do this or that, only as acuſtomary by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> word; this is no doubt more then on ordinary taking of God's Name in vain in common diſcourſe, becauſe ye take on you to bind others in the Name of God, not conſidering what ye are doing; and in a matter not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and of no weight expoſing the Name of the Lord to contempt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by tempting others to care but little for it; this is a moſt horrid and crying ſin amongſt our ordinary Beggars, whereof others alſo are guilty, who are not ſutably affected with it, and do not in their places ſeriouſly endeavour to have it mended; as alſo this is, when we deſire one another lightly &amp; irreverently to do ſuch &amp; ſuch a little thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Name of God, as to ſit down or riſe up, in God's Name, &amp;c. which things are alaſſe too too frequent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For adjuring of Devils, it is two ways lawful, and two ways not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is lawful to command Devils in the Name of God by thoſe who are called to it and are gifted to caſt them out. 2. It is lawful for any by Prayer to God, and the exerciſe of Faith on Him to endeavour to repel and reſiſt them, and to beg that he would rebuke them; as thus, The Lord rebuke thee Satan; this way we neither command the Devil, nor pray to him, but pray unto the Lord to command him.</p>
               <p>Again: It is unlawful, 1. when one adjureth him who is not called to it, as thoſe Sons of <hi>Sceva</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 13, 14. This certainly being a peculiar and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gift, as thoſe of prophecying, foretelling of things to come, ſpeaking with Tongues, and healing of the Sick with a word, were; ought not without ſpecial warrant to be uſurped more then they.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is unlawful when it is done by exhorting or obteſting of, or praying unto the Devil himſelf, &amp; intreating him as we do God, which way implyeth, 1. Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him when we intreat him as a Friend. 2. Prayer or worſhip to him who is not the object of it. 3. An obligation on us to him, when he yieldeth to obey; and he will not fail, if by any means he can, to put that complement or obligation on us, and ſo Necromancers, Witches, Exorciſts, &amp;c. may caſt out Devils by colluſion (though poſſibly not in a way ſo explicit), whereby the Devil gaineth his point upon ſuch as effectually, as if there were a moſt expreſly formed Covenant betwixt him and them, and thus the <hi>Phariſees</hi> falſly and blaſphemouſly, charged on our bleſed Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. as if by Belezebub<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is by Colluſion with the Prince of Devils, he had caſt out Devils. There are no doubt, many Sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this way, while ſome take on them confidently to Command the Devil, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f with an <hi>Avoid Satan,</hi> they could put him into Bonds: And others ſeek Health from Devils or Witches, eſpecially when it is ſuppoſed to come from them,) and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atreat them to do ſuch and ſuch things: All which are Breaches of this Part of the Third Commandment.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:31633:62"/>
3. What is ſaid of Adjuring Devils, may be ſaid Proportionally of Adjuring Unreaſonable Creatures, which is the ſame ways Lawful and unlawful: Charming alſo, and naming the Lords Name over Diſeaſes, as if ſome ſpecial worth and Efficacy were in ſome words; is unlawfull and Condemned by this Command.</p>
               <p>It followeth now that we ſay ſome-thing to Vows, which are Bonds, whereby a man bindeth himſelf (and ſo they differ from Adjurations) to God only as party, and that in things belonging to God; willingly, and upon Deliberation. (And ſo they differ from Promiſſory Oaths, wherein we bind our ſelves to others: and in matters which are not of themſelves Religious.)</p>
               <p>Under Vows we comprehend, 1. Sacraments. 2. Covenants, ſolemnly inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into before others. 3. Particular Vows to God. 4. Promiſes and ingagements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether inward in the Heart onely, or alſo outwardly expreſſed to, or before the Lord: For though theſe have not alwayes Gods Name, formally and expreſly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet He being Party, and they being made to him, he cannot but be ſingularly looked at, as Party, Witneſs, and Judge, in the making and performing of them: Therefore, do we comprehend all even purpoſes, expreſſed in Prayer to him, as being of the ſame kind, though not of the like Degree.</p>
               <p>We mind not here to medle with ſpeculative Debates about Vows, but to hold us only at what concerneth Practiſe: And ſay, 1. That ſuch Promiſes to God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, being rightly made and taken on, or rightly goneabout; are not onely Lawful, but ſometimes neceſſarily called for, as appeareth. 1. From the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which is to Vow, as well as to perform, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 76 11. 2. From Example of Saints in all Ages: <hi>David</hi> faith, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. when his frame is moſt tender, Verſe 57. <hi>I have ſaid. I will keep thy words.</hi> And thereafter, Verſe 106. <hi>I have ſworn, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> well perform it, That I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll keep thy righteous Judgements.</hi> For, ſaying and ſwearing to God are near the ſame; and who ſincerely ſay in ſecret, may in ſome Caſes alſo Articulatly ſwear. 3. From the end of Vows, which is to bind us to ſomething the more ſtraitly, and to evidence our greater deſire and willingneſs to be ſo bound: And therefore they being Midſes, for that end; when the end is in a ſpecial manner called for: and may, in all probability, be the better obtained, by the uſe of this Mean: then is it called for alſo, and cannot be omitted. 4. From the Lords gracious accepting of ſuch Engagements and Vows, and approving of them. 5. From the ſeveral Promiſe and Prophecies of them, as commendable and good ſervice, from Men to God, under the Goſpel, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 19. 18. and 21. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 4, 5. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44. 5.</p>
               <p>So then, I ſay, 1. <hi>In ſome Caſes;</hi> to wit, when it glorifieth God, and edifieth others; or is profitable to our ſelves: But if it thwart with any of theſe, there is a fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: or when ſome preſſure of Spirit, or cogent Reaſon, putteth us not to it, or ſome great need calleth for it; (as <hi>Abraham,</hi> for the weighty Reaſon, expreſſed by himſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. ſwore he would take none of the ſpoil, he had reſcued from the Kings over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by him:) For we are not alwayes called to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſay, <hi>Not in all Things:</hi> Becauſe the matter of a Vow, muſt be one of theſe two: Either, 1. Some commanded Duty, as <hi>Jacob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Vow, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 28. and <hi>Davids, Pſalm</hi> 119. 106. were: Or 2. Something that relateth to Worship: or may further ſome commanded Duty, or prevent ſome ſin, to which we are given, and much inclined: As ſuppoſe a Man should engage himſelf to riſe ſooner in the morning, that he might the more effectually croſs the luſt of his lazineſs, and to keep more at home, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to prevent the ſnare of evil, and Looſe-Company: It is not Houſe-keeping ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, or riſing ſoon, that is the matter of his Vow: but as they relate unto, or are made uſe of for ſuch ends: Therefore Vows can onely be made to God alone, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 76. 11. and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 132. 2.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:31633:62"/>
3. I ſay, <hi>Rightly gone about:</hi> That is, 1. Deliberately, and Judiciouſly; for Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Haſte, and Raſhneſs will ſpill all. 2. With Humility, and due ſenſe of our own Corruption, which maketh us (Alace!) to ſtand in need of ſuch Bands to keep it in, and of ſuch Up-ſtirrings and Excitments to Duty. 3. With fear, ſingleneſs, and Zeal for God; with love to his Honour, and to true Holineſs: Not for our ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends, to gratifie an Humour or Paſſion, or in Fits of Conviction, to ſtop the Mouth of a Challenge, and ſo put it by.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Vow would be heartily, and chearfully undertaken, not as a piece of Bondage, but of Liberty, that we may be thereby indeed ingaged unto the <hi>Lord</hi> having no hink or Heſitation; nor Reſervation in the making of it: what can be expected as to the performance, if therebe Heſitation, in the very under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking?</p>
               <p n="5">5. There should be much denyedneſs in it. 1. To our ſelves. 2. To the Oath as not accounting our ſelves to be more Religious by it; or more pleaſing to God, as if it merited ſomewhat; nor yet more ſtrengthned by making of it, but more ingaged to perform, and keep what we have vowed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There should be Diligence in doing, going on, and helping and inciting others to joyne with us; that ſo it may through Grace be made irrevocable, which is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the people of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 4, 5.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There should be ingaging, in the lively Exerciſe of Faith; drawing ſtrength from Jeſus Chriſt, according to his own promiſe; and of our ſelves to make uſe of him, for that end: Yea, that should be laid for the foundation of our undertaking: Therefore every ſuch ingaging, is a Covenanting with God, and there is no Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with Him, but by interpoſing of Jeſus Chriſt, both for the procuring of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for by-paſt failings and guilt; and for Grace and Strength, to perform, called for, and ingaged into Duties, for the future. See a frame of Spirit fit for Covenanting, when ſeriouſly and ſuitably gone about. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Concerning theſe Ingagements, we ſay. 2. That they are of themſelves Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and binding to thoſe who come under them, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. 2, 3. Vowing is called the binding of a Mans ſoul; And <hi>Pſalm</hi> 36. 12. its ſaid, <hi>Thy Vows are upon me, O Lord,</hi> as preſſing him with a Weight, till they were payed.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, 1. How Vows bind? We Anſwer, 1. In moral Duties, they make the Obligation no greater; for, they being laid on by the Command of God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Authority, there can be no Addition to that in it ſelf: But there is a two-fold Addition. 1. In reſpect of us; ſo that though the Obligation be not greater in it ſelf, yet we joyn our Approbation or Conſent unto that, whereby, as by a poſitive Super-added voluntary Conſent, we bind our ſelves; ſo that in ſome reſpect we have two Bonds (the Law, and our Oath both) for one. 2. Though it make not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Obligation, to bind more ſtrongly in it ſelf; yet it maketh that Obligation to have a more deep Impreſſion upon us; ſo that a man, by Vow bound to a commanded Duty, will think himſelf more bound to it, then before; and that Command will have a deeper Impreſſion, and more weight on him, to perſwade him to do, and to challenge him when he hath omitted, then before. Again, in things that are meerly Acceſſories to a Religious end, as Extrinſick means; for inſtance, faſting, ſtaying at home, &amp;c. Vowing, never maketh the doing of theſe of themſelves, to be Acts of religious Worship; but it maketh our keeping of them to be by a Religious Tye: ſo that without Prophanity they cannot be altered, out of the caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, 2. What is to be thought of our common and ordinary Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:31633:63"/>
1. By Baptiſm. 2. At the Lords Supper. 3. By Oaths in Covenants. 4. Ingagements in Private to God by Vows, Purpoſes, Promiſes, Reſolutions, in thoughts within; or expreſſed in Prayer: (I ſuppoſe it doth not a little concern all of you to know, how they bind and when they are broken.) We Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That, All theſe are binding, and ſtill accounted ſo, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 119. 106, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67.) is not to be doubted, yea binding in an Eminent Degree, as being made to God and not only Before Him: The nature of the thing and our conſent alſo bindeth, For, 1. If interpoſing the Name of God to men doth bind, much more to God: 2. If a Promiſe ſolemnly ratifyed bind to men, much more to God. Hence 3. Our, Obligations in Baptiſm, and the Lords-Supper, receive Strength and Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt us from the Covenant, which we ſolemnly Ratifie and renew with God therein, and that before the World: And our Breach of theſe Vows is charged on us by the Lord, as an open Breach of his Covenant; the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof is pleaded from them, <hi>Geneſis,</hi> 17, verſe 10. and 14. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet do they not bind abſolutely, as the Duty lyeth upon us and as we ſhould aim at it; for though we be bound by the Law to be perfectly Holy, and without ſin; yet doth not a Vow ſo tye us, or that Obligation is not from our Vow, but from the Law; becauſe our Vow is to be underſtood, 1. With Reſpect to our Nature, now Corrupt and ſinful: and therefore to Vow, abſolutely, to be without Sin, or abſolutely to abſtain from it, is injurious and impoſſible, 2. With reſpect to our aim and deſire. 3, With reſpect to our not Approving, or Diſ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving onr ſelves in any thing, wherein we come ſhort. 4. In reſpect of the Obligation to endeavour it, which is, alway, and by all ſuitable means to preſſe at it, and to leave nothing undone, which may further it: So then 1. They do not bind Abſolutely or Simply, but Reſpectively. 2. Not as to the Victory, but as to the Wreſtling and Fighting for Victory. 3. Not as to the Event, but as to the Means which are in our Power; and therefore ſome plead, That they had not broken Covenant, though they had Sins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 17</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though they bind not Simply or Abſolutely, (and are not therefore to be ſo taken or underſtood) yet they tye Abſolutely, 1. To the main of having God ours in Chriſt. 2. In other things, thus:</p>
               <p>1. They tye us to live in no known Sin, eſpecially Outward Sins and to delight in none. 2. To omit no Known Duty, but to eſſay the doing of it. 3. As to the Maner, to eſſay it ſeriouſly; ſo that though a man cannot ſwear, that he ſhall have no Corruption in him, while he is upon Earth: Yet in ſo far he may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As 1. Not to approve of it. 2. To leave no means uneſſayed, conſiſting in his Knowledge, that may help to mortifie it. 3. Seriouſly, and in good Earneſt, to be aiming at the Mortification of it, in the Uſe of theſe. And ſo this Tye of a Vow is, 1. As far as in us lyeth. 2. As Univerſal as the Duty is. 3. Conſtant and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways binding. 4. When it's taken on, we ſhould not let it lye on, (to ſay ſo) till the Sun go down, but endeavour that we may be free of it; it bindeth us to quit Sin, as well as to eſchew it. It reaches not all Infirmities, to make them Breaches; but known Sins, or the leaſt ſins ſtuck to.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning theſe Vows, we ſay; That the Breach of them is a very great Sin, and doth much more aggravate Sin, where it is, then where it is not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:31633:63"/>
Sins of Chriſtians againſt Baptiſm, Communions, Oaths in Covenants, Secret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, Reſolutions, and Promiſes to God, are much greater then the Sins of others. Hence the Lord chargeth <hi>Iſrael</hi> with Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Breaking, by vertue of their Circumciſion which they had received as a Seal thereof, and aggravateth all their Sins by that, and looketh on them in that Reſpect as ſingularly ſinful, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 24. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 8. &amp;c. which could not ſo well be, if there were not ſome Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity in that Obligation. Our Baptiſm, doubtleſs, is no leſs binding unto us, nor the Breach of our Baptiſme Vows leſs ſinful, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. Neither can there be any reaſon given, Why the Breach of an Oath to man, ſhould be charged on a Perſon, as a Sin and Infamy; and the Breach of an Oath to God, not be much more charged ſo. Oh! Take notice then, ye who ſin willingly, who Drink, Swear, omit Prayer; Let your minds wander, and ſtudy not Holineſs in good earneſt, that your ſins have theſe Aggravations to make them horrible, infamous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable. 1. There is manifeſt Perjury againſt the Oath of God, which even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Phariſees Doctrine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 33. was Abominable: Thou ſhalt not (ſay they) Forſwear thy ſelf, but ſhalt pay or perform thy Oath to the Lord. 2. There is unfaithful dealing, and abominable Treachery, to break under truſt, and to keep no ingagement to Him. 3. There is not onely Perjury, and Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſimply; but towards God. which is more, and draweth a great deal deeper, then towards any other. It's Dreadful to deal Unfaithfully, Treacherouſly, and Perjuriouſly with Him. 4. All this is in things that are very equitable and much for your own good, which maketh no ſmall aggravation. 5. This is done not onely againſt promiſes, but againſt many promiſes, and many other bands. 6. That its often and in many things that you ſin againſt theſe promiſes. 7. That ſin is little reſented or laid to heart on this conſideration, and as ſo ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, Then it is better to make no promiſes at all, then to come under ſuch aggravations of guilt by breaches of them, for none keep them exactly: and ſo men muſt needs be in great and continual diſquietneſs and anxiety while under them; Were it not better, then, to be doing without promiſing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is not free to us, Not to make them more then it is to break them, or not to keep them; and when we are called to make ſuch Promiſes, and make them not, it becometh ſin to us as was ſaid. Its not free to us, whether we ſhall be Baptiſed, &amp;c. communicate, &amp;c. or not; therefore, whoſoever would not ſo engage, were to be cenſured and puniſhed as utter deſpiſers of the Lords Covenant, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17. 14, &amp;c. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They, who refuſe to take them, ſay themſelves open to the temptation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more eaſily prevailed with, not to perform theſe duties, or of being ſooner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ared in ſuch ſins, becauſe they are not formally engaged by Vow againſt them, &amp; ſo they make themſelves culpably acceſſory to the ſtrengthening of tentation, and weakning of reſolution; to the contrary whereof, they are no doubt obliged.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you intend indeed to perform theſe duties, then ye may ingage to do ſo; but if ye will not ſo much as Promiſe and engage to do them, it cannot be expected in reaſon that ye will do them; eſpecially conſidering that even theſe who honeſtly promiſe and ingage, do yet notwithſtanding, find a great difficulty to do and perform. O take heed that you be not, by your refuſing to engage, making a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:31633:64"/>
back-door for your ſelves to go out from your duty, that ſo you may the more eaſily, and with the leſs challenge, shift it.</p>
               <p>If it be yet ſaid, that the ſin of ſimple omitting the duty, is leſs then the omitting of it after engagements and Vows to the contrary. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is not ſo to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, who is called to engage himſelf: yea, who by Baptiſme is already ingaged; for 1. The man that neither ingageth to do, nor doth the duty, faileth twice, whereas he that ingageth and performeth not, faileth but once: though that once failing, is, by its being croſs to his ingagement, not a little aggravated; ſo that in ſome reſpect each fault or failing exceedeth the other: the one is a greater ſin conſidered in it ſelf, but the other is greater conſidered complexly. 2. The man that ingageth not, is more acceſſory to his own falling, in reſpect that he uſed not that mean to prevent it; yet the other when fallen, is more guilty, in reſpect of the breach of his ingagement. 3. The man that will not ingage, bringeth him elf under a neceſſity of finning; for if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not, he faileth twice, as is ſaid; if he perform, he faileth, becauſe he ingaged not when he was called to it, ſo his performing is not the performing of a Vow to God, who requireth promiſing, in ſome caſes at leaſt, as well as performing. 4. The man that Promiſeth and Voweth, and alſo performeth what he Promiſed and Vowed, his performing is ſo much the more acceptable, as it proceedeth not only from the awe of a Command, but from a ſpontaneous and free-will offering of it to God, and ſo is both Obedience to a Command, and the performance of a Vow; for thus, he choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth obedience, as it is <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 30. It is not ſo with the other, whether he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it or not, though we think, that God often letteth the man fall that will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, becauſe he ſayeth by his refuſal that he truſteth not to God for the performance, otherwiſe he would ingage and undertake on his account alſo; he ſayeth withal, that he aimeth to perform, onely becauſe he cannot eſchew it: And if he could shake off, and be freed from that Obligation to Holineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he would not out of reſpect to God, or love to Holineſs, take on a new one. 5. The man that ingageth not, ſinneth more unexcuſably in that he will not do that which is the leſſer, and in his power. The leſs and more eaſie a thing it be to promiſe and ingage (as it is no doubt more eaſie then to perform) the omiſſion of it is the greater ſin, and more inexcuſable. The caſe is indeed, as to Heathens, otherwiſe, who were never thus engaged, nor called to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themſelves; but unto Chriſtians it will be no excuſe.</p>
               <p>If it be replyed that this is very hard; for then no Chriſtian will be free of Perjury, not have Peace. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I grant the caſe is hard, and the Strait great; but it is ſuch as floweth from our own corruption in this, as in other duties and parts of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for as the Law is holy, juſt, and good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and is not to be blamed as acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory to our ſin; ſo ſhe Vow is holy, juſt, and good, and is not to be blamed, if in the circumſtances right, becauſe of our breach. 2.

That they had ſome teſtimony as to what was paſt, that they had in ſome meaſure walked according to their engagements, and had left nothing undone, at leaſt willingly, and with approbation of themſelves therein, that might have furthered them in keeping Covenant, but had ſtuck to him in doing and ſuffering honeſtly; a man ſincerely, and in the ſtrength of grace ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying this, may attain to ſuch a teſtimony from his own Conſcience, and to a good meaſure of peace; yea, a man that may have quietneſs in his performing duty upon the account of other tyes, without engaging, may alſo come to have quietneſs in his engaging to it.</p>
               <p>If then there be a neceſſity to engage, it may be asked, How peace may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, and how we may be helped to perform? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.

Delayes make the impreſſion of the weight of the Vow, &amp; of the dread of him to whom it is made, much to wear out: and taking liberty to be ſtack in paying of it, for, but for this once, or for a little while, is a direct breach of it ſelf, and maketh way for more. 3. Keep in mind, and entertain ſuch a frame of ſpirit as ye were in when they were at firſt made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch humility, tenderneſs, awe of God, &amp;c. We often, alace! take on Vows in a good frame, to be on the matter a ſort of excuſe for us in letting ſuch a frame go, or at leaſt to eaſe us a little for the time, as if engaging were performance, which is not the leaſt part of the deceit of our hearts. 4. The performance of the thing would be followed as it is undertaken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, in the ſtrength of grace, and by virtue of life derived from Jeſus Chriſt, quickning and ſtrengthening us both as promiſing and performing. 5.

               <p>The great breach of this Command is Blaſphemy, though Perjury be moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. That we may ſee how this ſin is fallen into, we ſhal 1. Define it; 2. Divide or diſtinguiſh it, which we ſhall find to be exceeding broad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Blaſphemy then againſt God, (as the word beareth) is a wronging of Gods holy Majeſty by ſome reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpeeches or expreſſions, uttered to his diſgrace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſay <hi>Uttered,</hi> becauſe that which is in the heart is moſt part <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and Infidelity, and ſo belongeth to the firſt Command.</p>
               <p>Of this there are three ſorts, or there are three wayes whereby men fall into it: 1. When any thing unbecoming God, is in word attributed to him, is unjuſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, unmercyful, &amp;c. ſuch as that complaint, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 25. <hi>The wayes of the Lord are not equal.</hi> 2. When what is due to him is denyed him; as when he is ſaid, not to be Eternal, Omniſcient, Almighty, &amp;c. as he was by proud <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and railing <hi>Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When what is due to God is attributed to a Creature, or arrogated by a Creature; thus the <hi>Jews</hi> charged <hi>Christ</hi> as guilty of blaſphemy, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 49. and <hi>John</hi> 10. 33. (ſuppoſing him to be a Creature) becauſe he forgave ſins, and called himſelf God; of this ſort of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as to ſome degree of it, is the commending or crying up our own or others parts, pains, wit, &amp;c. for attaining, effecting, and bringing to paſs of ſomewhat to the prejudice of divine providence; ſo thoſe of <hi>Zidon</hi> did to <hi>Herod,</hi> Acts 12. 22. And thus often men make Mediators and Saviours, as it were of themſelves and of other men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Blaſphemy may either be immediately and directly againſt God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or any of the perſons of the bleſſed Godhead; or mediately and indirectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, when it is againſt his Ordinances of the Word, Prayer.

               <p>But this ſin is 1. in the main of the Goſpel, and as to its ſaving work. 2. It is not only againſt light, but againſt the Spirits preſent teſtifying of it, or bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it, and after fore-going convictions yielded unto in ſome meaſure, and ſticking or lying on as weighty, and making the Conſcience to challenge, as may be gathered from <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 3.

Who not onely rejected Chriſt as to themſelves, but oppoſed him in all others, and ſought utterly to undo the Truth; <hi>This is the Heir, come let us kill him,</hi> ſay they. 4. This oppoſition flows from malice againſt the Truth, hatred of it, and from accounting it a thing unworthy to be in the World; not out of fear or infirmity, or from miſtake, but out of envy and deſpight at it for it ſelf: On this account the Lord objecteth it to the Phariſees, John 15. 24. <hi>But now they have both ſeen and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, and my Father,</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 5. It is univerſal againſt every thing of the Spirit, and obſtinately conſtant, without any relenting, grief, or fear, except onely left it attain not its end: the fear of that tormenteth it; but its malice and hatred groweth, as it is marred or obſtructed, being delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately begun and proſecuted. 6.

               <p n="1">1. That ſeeing this ſin (which can be ſaid of no other ſin) doth willfully, and out of deſpight, reject Chriſt, there can be no other Sacrifice gotten to expiate it, Hebr. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. That the Perſon guilty of this ſin cannot be renued by Repentance, the heart of him ſuppreſſing that work maliciouſly; this impoſſibility is not from the ineffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Grace, but from the order which God hath laid down in the working of Repentance, and in the pardoning of the Penitent; ſo that as he will pardon none but repenting Believers, ſo he will work repentance in none but in thoſe who yield, through Grace, to his Spirits Work.</p>

               <p>Theſe wayes of breaking this command ſpoken unto are more groſs and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary: we ſhould now ſpeak a word to ſuch as are more common in our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and theſe are of two ſorts.</p>
               <p>The firſt is more groſs, when the Name of God, or any thing bearing the Name of God as his Ordinances. Word, Sacraments, Prayer, &amp;c. are prophaned, out of Duty. This is done. 1. When theſe are mocked, or ſcorned, which is a high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of prophaning his Name, 2. When the Scripture-phraſes, expreſſions, or terms are baffled (to ſpeak ſo) to our ſinful ſcoffing, Jeibing, and geiring of others, though we do not directly mock or geir at the Scripture it ſelf. 3, When in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diſcourſe, and unneceſſarily, Gods Name is uſed, though we intend not ſwearing, neither think that we do ſwear. 4. When ordinarily upon ſuch and ſuch occaſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lords Name is uſed in irreverent, and unwarrantable exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as, <hi>O Lord, O God,</hi> what is this or that, &amp;c. I hope in God, or truſt in God to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:31633:67"/>
ſee ſuch a thing, &amp;c. And poſſibly ſometimes in paſſion. 5. When it is uſed in way of by-word, or of certain irreverent prayers, when a perſon is troubled and grieved, and would expreſs that paſſion at ſome thing that falleth out not deſired, God help me, God ſave me, what is that? what mean ye? God forgive me, God bleſs me, for Gods bleſſing do ſuch a thing: If God will, in Gods ſtrength, and I truſt in God, &amp;c. I ſhall do ſuch and ſuch a thing: for Gods ſake do this or that, &amp;c. 6. When it is uſed in meer complements, God keep you, God be with you, God bleſs you, &amp;c. which, with many, are too ordinary Complements. 7. When it is uſed lightly in way of aſſeveration and indirect ſwearing, God a bit, God have me, if it be ſo, &amp;c. 8. When it is uſed in a ſenſeleſs and ſuperſtitious cuſtome, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch and ſuch particular occaſions, as when men ſay, O, God be bleſſed, and <hi>God bleſs</hi> at ſternutation or neeſing (which <hi>Plinius</hi> reporteth to have been uſed by Heathens, and particularly by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who was none of the moſt religious men) God be here, God be in this houſe, when one entereth into a houſe; or when the Clock ſtriketh.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way (which is leſs groſs, but more ordinary) whereby we fail in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to this Command, is in lawful and neceſſary duties of worſhip, by ſinful and unprofitable diſcharging of theſe; whereby the Name of God is often taken in vain, and his holineſs which he loveth prophaned: this fault and failing is two wayes fallen into.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the manner of going about ſuch Ordinances or duties of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. 1. When the Lord is not ſanctified in them, nor the rule and manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Him, kept; this way, ſinned <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, Levit.</hi> 10. by their offering of ſtrange fire. The Lord complaineth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as guilty of this, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 29 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

While <hi>they drew near with their lips, and their hearts were far away, they worſhip me in vain,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>teaching for Doctrines the commandments of men.</hi> 2. When men uſe not ſuch ordinances, and perform not ſuch duties profitably, when prayer, reading of the Scripture, Sacrament, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, &amp;c. want their native fruit, then his Name is taken in vain, and in that reſpect his Ordinances fruſtrated and made, as if they had not been uſed or performed, ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. To <hi>receive the Grace of God in vain,</hi> is to miſs or let go the benefit of it, and to fruſtrate and diſappoint our ſelves of the native end and uſe of it; This is the firſt way in reſpect of which our duties are in vain as to God, ſo as he will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> regard them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way is as to our ſelves, and here again we may conſider the taking of the Lords Name in vain, in ordinances and duties two wayes, either 1. Simply, where there is no honeſty at all in them, not fruit from them, but meer Hypocriſie, or at leaſt Hypocriſie in ſuch particular Acts. Or 2. when it is Comparative, that is, though there may be ſome reality and fruit, yet conſidering what it ſhould be; yea, conſidering what means the perſon hath, there is a great defect as to that which ſhould and might have been; thus were the <hi>Hebrews</hi> challenged, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. 12. not that they were altogether fruitleſs, but that they were not ſo fruitful as under, and by ſuch means they might have been, and that therefore they had in a great part uſed them and received them in vain; this may and often doth befall even thoſe who have ſome meaſure of ſincerity, yet fall far ſhort of what they might have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the knowledge of God, and of other bleſſed fruits by the right improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the means they had.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:31633:68"/>
We may add a third way how his Name is taken in vain, and that in reſpect o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it ſelf, or of the ordinance or duty; what indeed it is, and in reſpect of what it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be, when the ſhew is much more than the ſubſtance; and when the ſincerity, reality, and inward Reverence and eſteem of our heart in nameing God, keepeth no juſt proportion with the words of our mouth, and our large external profeſſion; thus did the Phariſes, and thus do all Hypocrits take and bear Gods name in vain, not being at all anſwerable to what they ſeem to be; thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> may be alſo in others comparatively, in reſpect, 1. of the Law. 2. in reſpect of the means we have, 3. in reſpect of our profeſſion.</p>
               <p>That our Conviction may be the clearer, let us ſee what belongeth to the righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> going about of duty, or to the ſuitable mentioning of the Lords Name, the want whereof, or any part thereof maketh us more or leſs guilty of taking it in vain 1. Then there is a neceſſity that we propoſe a good and right end, and al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ſingly at it; for if all things ſhould be done to Gods glory, this of the Naming of the Lord ſhould be in a ſpecial manner ſo: this is a mans call to Pray, Preach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hear, &amp;c. to wit, the concernment of Gods Name, that is, 1. That God may be honoured. 2. That we our ſelves, or others may be edified. 3. That a command may be obeyed in the Conſcience of Duty; Thoſe then who adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to profeſs or name God, or to go about any ordinance, ſeeking themſelves and not the Lord, as is ſuppoſed men may do, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. 2. out of envy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they did of whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 15, 16. 3, To be honoured of men, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> deſigned by their long prayers. 4. For the faſhion, or out of meer cuſtome. 5. For making peace with God, by mentioning his name ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Ordinances, miſ-regarding and taking no notice of the Mediator in the mean time: theſe <hi>I</hi> ſay and ſuch like will meet with that ſad word, <hi>In vain doy worſhip me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a neceſſity of a good principle in naming the Lord (to ſpeak ſo) both of a Moral and Phyſical principle: the Moral, is Conſcience, and not Cuſtome, which falleth in with the end, the Phyſical is the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>No man calleth Jeſus Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</hi> 2. A renewed heart, thus Duties muſt be done with the ſpirit, as well as with the underſtanding 3. Sinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erity, as to the exerciſe even of the natural faculties; Thus what ever unrenew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men ſpeak in Duty, without the Spirits influence and exerciſe of grace, they make themſelves guilty in it; and, when they ſay, what in ſincerity they think not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is neceſſary that that principle act in the right manner, that is, 1, Sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 14. 2. In fear and reverence, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 1, 2. 3. With faith an dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. 4. With Judgment and underſtanding. To ſpeak of him, not knowing what we ſay, or to whom we ſpeak, wrongeth him: thus ignorant, paſſionate, raſh, irreverent and inadvertent mentioning of God, or medling with any Ordinance or Duty, wrongeth him, and is a bringing of vain oblations, which he expreſly forbiddeth, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When ever we make mention of God, we ſhould ſtudy to be in caſe to mention him as ours, as our God and Father in Chriſt, in all ordinances and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that is, 1. Taking up our natural diſtance. 2. Looking to Chriſt for remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. 3. Reſting on him, and making uſe of him for that end. 4. Delighting
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:31633:68"/>
in the mentioning of God as ours. 5. With thankſgiving and bleſſing, when ever he is named, as the Apoſtle often doth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is required in reſpect of the uſe, fruit, and effect, that ſomething which is profitable may remain and ſtick with us, according to the nature of the duty which is gone about, or the way of mentioning God, ſuch as ſome conviction and teſtimony of the Conſcience. 1. That Gods honour; 2. The edification of others in way of Inſtruction, or Conviction, or of Reproof, or of Comfort, &amp;c. 3. My own edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſpiritual advantage, or, 4. My own exoneration and peace, as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch a duty, were in ſome meaſure of ſingleneſs aimed at and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and as there is a miſſing of any of theſe, Repentance ſhould be exerciſed, and faith for pardon; ſome fruit, ſome ſenſe, ſome leſſon, ſome diſcoveries, ſome convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, &amp;c. would be ſought after to remain. When theſe or any of theſe, (if all the reſt of them can be altogether without one) are wanting, this command is ſimply broken; if in part they be wanting, it is comparatively more or leſs broken.</p>
               <p>Let us then take a view in particulars. 1. Look to our profeſſion, Oh! what emptineſs is there, much more appearance and shew, then reality and ſubſtance? yea, what deſiring to ſeem ſomething, rather then to be? if our profeſſions (who are leaſt in them) were met and meaſured by our reality, O how lamentable vaſt a diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be found? the one would be quickly found much broader and longer then the other, the outer-half much bagged as it were, being a great deal larger then the inner, even where there is moſt ſincerity and reality.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Look through publick duties, if there be not much taking of Gods Name in vain, in hearing, praying, praiſing, uſing the Sacraments, &amp;c. and if ſo, O what a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell might be drawn up againſt us from every Sabbath, Prayer, Sermon, &amp;c. whereof we often cannot tell what fruit remaineth, except it be ſin, guilt, and hardneſs; and therefore doubtleſs his Name is much taken in vain in them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Look through private duties in Families, Reading, Praying, Singing, Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Catechifing, ſaying Grace, or ſeeking a Bleſſing, and giving thanks at Table; how little regard is often had to the name of the Lord in theſe? and how little care and pains is taken to walk by the former rules in them?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Look through ſecret duties, betwixt God and you, how ye pray in ſecret before God: Ah! often ſo, as ye would be ashamed to pray before men; how do ye Read, Meditate, &amp;c. in ſecret? how do ye joyn in prayer with others? which in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is ſecret; God knoweth how poorly we acquit our ſelves in theſe ordinarily, and how much we take his Name in vain in them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Look through occaſional duties, wherein ye have occaſion to make mention of God with or to others, as when upon any Emergent of providence, we will ſay, It is Gods will, God hath done it, God is good and merciful, &amp;c. or in any particular duty of Chriſtian Communion, in inſtructing, comforting, admonishing, or convincing of others, or debating with them; how often, when the Scripture, and the name of God will be in our mouths: in theſe, and the matter of debate may fall to be ſome of his Ordinances, will there be but very little reverence and reſpect to God in our hearts?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider how this ſin of taking his Name in vain is fallen in by writing, not only when Treatiſes are written, but almoſt in every Epiſtle or Letter, there will be found ſome prayer or wish, for fashion-ſake, wherein there is but little Conſcience made to have the heart joyning in it; how much irreverent uſing of the Scripture and of Gods Name, is there in writing of Letters, particularly of Burial-letters, thus.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:31633:69"/>
It hath pleaſed the Lord, it hath ſeemed good to God, it hath pleaſed God or the Almighty, &amp;c. I am not condemning the thing ſimply, but our way of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it,</p>
               <p n="7">7. Look through accidental mentioning of God (if we may ſay ſo) in ſalut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, God ſave you, God be with you; In prayers for Children, evidencing rather our fondneſs on them thereby, then our love and reverence to the Name of God; for ſuch as are in any preſent hazard, God ſave; for any favour, curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or complement, God bleſs; theſe are good (as the Apoſtle ſaith of the Law) if uſed lawfully, but they are often ſinfully, raſhly, ignorantly, yea prophanely abuſed, we having often more reſpect to them we ſpeak unto, then unto God. I would not condemn the uſe of them being duties, but exhort you to gard againſt the abuſe, and to uſe a grave, reverent, underſtanding, and ſenſible way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of them, or of any thing like them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Conſider narrations of Scripture-ſtories, or other ſtories, queſtions, tales, &amp;c. wherein the Name of God is mentioned, and poſſibly when we tell them, to make a ſport of them, and to make merry with them; how often is his bleſſed Name taken in vain in them? certainly the mentioning of his Name were often better forborn, then ſo irreverently uſed.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Conſider the uſurping of Gods Attributes, or of an intereſt in him, raſhly, as when men confidently, yet without all warrant, aſſert God is mine; I truſt in his mercy, ſweet Chriſt my Saviour, my Mediator: Ah! how often is this, which is the very Crown of grace, to wit, in Gods doing good and ſhewing mercy, abuſed and prophaned moſt ſinfully and ſhamefully!</p>
               <p>There is one particular, which yet remaineth to be ſpoken of on this Third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which concerneth Lots, Omens, Superſtitious Obſervations and ſuch like, whereby the Name of God is wronged, in being not only ſlighted, contemned and taken in vain in theſe events (which yet are guided by Him) but the Diſpoſal of things, which is due to God, is denyed to Him, and Attributed to Chance, Luck, Fortune, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>We ſhall then: 1. Shew what <hi>Lotting</hi> or <hi>Lottery</hi> is. 2. How it concerneth this Command. 3. Diſtinguiſh Lots, into ſeveral ſorts. 4. Shew what are Lawful, and when they are Lawful. 5. What are Unlawful.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Lot</hi> or <hi>Lotting</hi> is, The Committing, of the Deciſion of ſome thing, in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate way to Divine Providence, without the intervening Cauſalities, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, of any ſecond Cauſe, to ſway in that Deciſion: So that when the thing falleth out, and is decided, there can be no Reaſon given, Why it is ſo on Mens part, but that the Lord was pleaſed to diſpoſe: As it was in that Inſtance of Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, about the Election of the twelve Apoſtle, in <hi>Judas</hi> his room, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. So from <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 33. It's clear that that is a Lot; <hi>Whereof the whole diſpoſal is of God:</hi> And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>To cauſe Contentions to ceaſe, and to part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Mighty:</hi> Becauſe none can quarrel, concerning that which Man hath no hand in.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Lot</hi> may be many ways appointed, either by the throw of a Dice, or the like; or by ſome other mean putting difference, betwixt one and other, even as men ſhall appoint: as when it is; By what Beaſt they ſhall firſt ſee, by what ſaying, or by what Book they ſhall firſt hear, or look on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. Onely we think Lots differ from
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:31633:69"/>
Omens, or ſuperſtitious Obſervations, thus: 1. Lots are to decide betwixt two; the other are Collections, which one may make concerning himſelf. 2. Lots follow on ſome appointment that is mutual and are free; the other may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</p>
               <p>That Lots in the uſe of them, concern this Command, theſe things will make it out ſeveral wayes. 1. That which putteth God to it, in an immediate way, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth this Command, eſpecially; I mean, whatever putteth him to declare his mind, or reveal himſelf, that putteth him to it, and is a ſpecial implicite invocating of Him: But Lots or Lotting, putteth him to it, in an immediate way; For, 1. None other can diſpoſe of them but he, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 33. 2. What is diſcovered by thoſe Lots, is either Gods mind or the Devils, or is by chance; but it cannot be any of the latter two, therefore it is the firſt. 3. It is the putting him to it, more then he is by Prayer: Becauſe, 1. It is by an Extraordinary way, and often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Prayer. 2. It is for the manifeſting of a ſecret Decree; For by it, we are to underſtaud, what God has appointed, and Eternally decreed, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an event. Hence it is, that in Scripture, Prayer is ſo often, if not alwayes joyned with it; and therefore it muſt in a ſpecial manner belong to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: Yea, if God be ſlighted in it, he is wronged: if acknowledged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Intereſt, he is in a ſpecial manner concerned, where he wholly ordereth the thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is either a Mean, appointed by him to underſtand his mind or not; if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him, then it is in ſo far his Ordinance, and his Name is concerned in it; if not, then it is abuſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The medling with Gods Secret, or with his Will, or Way of revealing it in his Providence, muſt belong to this Command; but this eſpecially, meddleth with all theſe: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That which cannot be gone about, but the Name of the Lord, is either wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or honoured, in it: muſt neceſſarily belong to this Command, for that is the ſcope of it: But none can Lot without either depending on God, for the ordering of, and acknowledging of him in it, when it is done; and ſo without honouring him, or neglecting him, and ſo taking his Name in vain. 1. By miskenning his Providence, and thinking to get that decided ſome other way. 2. By irreverent going about it. 3. By Attributing it to ſome other thing. 4. By not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging God in it, nor ſubmitting to it, when done ſo. So then theſe three wayes men fail, and take Gods Name in vain. 1. Before the Lot. 2. In the time of it. 3. After it is paſt.</p>
               <p>Lots, are ordinarily divided into three ſorts. 1. <hi>Divine,</hi> which are from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Warrants. 2, <hi>Deviliſh,</hi> wherein the Devil is either invocated, or, in Circumſtances, the Deciſion is put to him, and guided by him. 3. <hi>Humane,</hi> which are ordinarily gone about amongſt men.</p>
               <p>Again, They are divided: 1. In <hi>Divinatory.</hi> 2. <hi>Conſultatory,</hi> whereby men find out ſomewhat that is ſecret, as <hi>Soul</hi> found out <hi>Jonathan;</hi> or are led to ſome Duty. 3. <hi>Diviſory.</hi> By ſuch the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was divided, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 13. 6. 4. <hi>Luſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yea, they ſeem to be from the Light of Nature, <hi>Jona</hi> 1. 2. The uſe of them, is Moral and perpetual, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 18. To cauſe Contentions to ceaſe, and to part between the Mighty. 3. When they are rightly gone about, they are a Honouring of God, and are a Manifeſt acknowledging of his Providence. I ſay, Rightly gone about: Where, 1. The matter ſhould be weighty or of ſome Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; that is, It should either be weighty in it ſelf; or it should be ſo by ſome Con equence, or Inconvenience; making a light thing in it ſelf weighty, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is (as Swearing is, in a matter of no moment) but a baffling of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It should be Neceſſary, that is a thing, that without many Inconveniences, cannot be in another way decided: otherwiſe to put God to reveal his mind, in an Extraordinary way, when there is an Ordinary at hand, is a tempting of God; even as, to leap over a Wall is, while there is an ordinary paſſage to go thorow by.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It should be with a due Reſpect to God, acknowledging him, to be the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, calling on his Name in the uſe of it, and looking to him for the Deciſion, as we ſee almoſt in all Lottings, and even of thoſe Heathens, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It should be gone about, in the right manner. 1. With Reverence, as if we were to hear God pronounce the Sentence, and ſpeak his Mind; as while <hi>Saul</hi> is a-taking, the People <hi>ſtand before the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 19, 22. 2. In the Faith that God guideth it; and ſo, without Anxiety and fear. 3. In Singleneſs, Committing it to Him, even in Heart, as well as in Appearance; Abſtaining from all Fraud or Tricks, or any thing which may have influence, as a ſecond cauſe, to mar or caſt the Deciſion; this were a high way of mocking God, to put the Deciſion to Him, and yet to endeavour to give the Anſwer our ſelves,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, After the Lot, there should be a reverend acknowledging of Gods Mind, without fretting or grumbling, and a chearful ſubmitting to it, as we ſee in all the Caſes inſtanced in Scripture. Theſe Rules being obſerved, we think that for dividing of Stations or Charges; or of Portions, which cannot be other-ways done, without offence or prejudice; Lots may be uſed.</p>
               <p>Yet, I would ſay theſe few things, for Caution here: 1. Ye should not in petty things uſe them, when the matter is of no value at all, or of very ſmall value; ſo that ye are indifferent, how it falls out: Or when it is not of that weight, that ye would give an Oath in it; but rather quit it, (and there would be here a Proportion kept,) ye should rather in ſuch a Caſe hazard ſome Loſs then put it to a Lot, out of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence ye owe to Gods Name: All the Caſes in Scripture are weighty: In your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Merchandize, I deſire you to remember this:</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ye should not fail to uſe your Reaſon, and honeſt skill, more, in Sharings and Diviſions, for preventing of a Lot. Folks ſometimes, betake themſelves to theſe for
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:31633:70"/>
caſe, when yet their Reaſon, rightly made uſe of, might bring to a ſatisfying Deciſion. God hath not given Reaſon to Man in vain, or for nought: when Reaſon then may do it; eſſay it, and forbear a Lot.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let it be in ſuch a matter, and ſo uſed, as ye may ſeek God in it, and in-call His Name by Prayer: To lote in a thing, that folks will not, or dare not pray in, agreeth not with Scripture examples, nor with that tenderneſs which a Believer should have at ſuch a time: It should then be in a thing reſpecting a promiſe.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, we may ſee how men fail here, 1. In weighty things, by not keeping the right manner before the <hi>Lot,</hi> in the time of it, and after it is paſt, when it endeth not ſtrife. 2. In Trivial things, by making this too Cuſtomary; ſo that folk uſe the <hi>Lot</hi> almoſt in every thing, making that which is extraordinary to become ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, contrary to the nature thereof. It is an ultimate Judge and Decider, even as an Oath is for ending all Controverſies: it is like unto <hi>Moſes</hi> (as one ſaith,) the great matters should be reſerved to it; yea, it is greater then <hi>Moſes,</hi> its God himſelf, thus in His providence paſſing a Deciſion; The leſſer things would be other wayes decided.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may gather from what is ſaid, what is to be thought of ſuch Games and Paſtimes as run on Lottery (having that for the very foundation of them) and have an immediate dependance on providence for the iſſue of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they are <hi>Lottery</hi> cannot be denyed, for they have all that is in <hi>Lotting;</hi> there is in them a putting of things to a doubtful event as to us; and that event is guided ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by God, or by ſome other, and which-ever of the two, we ſay, it will be a breach of this Command; ſo trivially for our pleaſure to take the Name of God in vain, as many formally do; for none can tell, how ſuch a thing will come to paſs by any reaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That to do ſo, or to uſe a Lot in this caſe is a ſin, may alſo be made out clearly. 1. Becauſe it is againſt the end of Lots, which is to divide or decide where there is Controverſie, and ſo it interverteth their end, and becometh ſinful; even as ſwearing where no Controverſie is, is a ſin. 2. There is either no neceſſity at all to take that way, orthere is but a made-neceſſity of our own, it muſt therefore be a tempting of God; as ſuppoſe this to be the end of Lotting, to know in the upshot whether ſo much Money should belong to you, or to me; no doubt, that point of right to whom the Money belongeth, may be decided as well at the entry; therefore this way of deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is in vain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Lotting which hath in it no reverence to God, but baffleth his Name, nor is conſiſtent with the right manner of <hi>Lotting,</hi> cannot be lawful: but this is ſuch: for it is not only, <hi>de facto,</hi> contrary to the former rules, but in its own nature is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with them: this is clear, 1. From the great frequency of <hi>Lot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing</hi> in theſe Games. 2. In the little dependance on God for the event that is in them; and indeed a ſpiritual frame of dependance on him, cannot well, if at all conſiſt with them. 3. From its inconſiſtency with ſerious prayer: what! can or dare men pray in earneſt for Gods guiding in theſe things, in every throw of Dice, or shuffling of the Cards? or in faith expect ſtill the revealing of his Decree that way? or when it is done, and paſt, can they ſuitably acknowledge Him in it? Men dare not look ſo ſeriouſly on theſe things, yea, they know they dare not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That way of <hi>Lotting;</hi> which cannot but occaſion the wronging of the Name of the Lord, and his providence, cannot be right; but this is ſuch: for we muſt ſay, that either Gods hand is not at all in ſuch things, and ſo we deny his providence; or we muſt ſay that he may be put to it, by this common and coarſe way, and that in our
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:31633:71"/>
ſport, and for our pleaſure in his immediate providence to declare his mind; which is a notable Baffling (to ſay ſo) and Prophanation of his Name; hence it is that men ſo often Swear, Curſe, Fret, and exclaim in theſe Games at Cards, Dice, &amp;c. (wherein chance, luck, fortune, &amp;c. are ſo much looked to, and in a manner dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) and altogether overlook and miſ-regard the Majeſty of God, as if he had no Providence at all in ſuch things.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What is done without warrant of either Scripture-precept or practiſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be dose in faith? Now there can be no ſuch warrant drawn from Scripture for ſuch playes or games, the very foundation whereof is <hi>Lottery,</hi> and not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally and rarely incident to them, as may be on the matter to other lawful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, if that can be called <hi>Lottery</hi> at all, which is rather an undeſigned, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſurprizing incident of providence; whereas in the other, the deciſion by a <hi>Lot</hi> is deſigned, waited for, and all along the game referred unto, and hung upon: yea, it is inſuitable and inconſiſtent with the Scripture-way of uſing <hi>Lot is,</hi> which is alwayes in moſt grave and important things; but this way of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſing them is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly to abuſe them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That which hath a native tendency to make any Ordinance of God vile and contemptible, cannot be warrantable; Now that <hi>Lotting</hi> in theſe Games hath ſuch a tendency to make the Ordinance of a <hi>Lot,</hi> and of Prayer, which ſhould at leaſt be joyned with it, Contemptible; is obvious to any ſerious and impartial conſidere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of it, neither can it in reaſon be thought that, that which is in ſo ſacred a manner, and with Prayer to God, to be gone about in one thing, and is by Him appointed for ſuch an end as an Oath is; can warrantably be uſed in a manner, and for ends ſo vaſtly different from the former in an other thing.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If <hi>Lots</hi> belong at all to this Command, then theſe <hi>Lotting</hi>-Games are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: for they cannot with any Religious reaſon be ſuppoſed to be commanded in it, and therefore they muſt be forbidden. And if in trivial things <hi>Lots</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, much more in ſuch Games which end not ſtrife and contentions, but often and ordinarily begin them, and bring them to a height: and therefore do the Ancients declaim againſt this as a Sacrificing to Devils, and invented by Idolaters.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid here, that theſe things are thought but very little of by men: <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, and no great wonder; for moſt men uſe but to think little of the breach of this Command. Yet are their breaches ſinful notwithſtanding; as many take Gods Name in their mouth lightly, and think but little of it, and yet that maketh not their doing ſo, ceaſe to be a ſin. God hath added his Certification here the more peremptorily for that very end, that men may not think little, or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the very leaſt breach of this Command (to let paſs more groſſe breaches of it.)</p>
               <p>If it be further objected here, Why may not ſuch Playes or Games be uſed as well as other Playes, wherein ſometimes Chance or Fortune (as they call it) will caſt the Ballance? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Though in thoſe other, Chance may now and then occaſionally occur, yet that is but accidental, theſe are ſimply, or at leaſt moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guided by <hi>Lotting,</hi> and immediate providences, and cannot be prevented or made to be other wayes by the beſt art and skill of men. 2. In theſe other Games there is an intervention of ſecond cauſes, and an uſe of mens parts; Natural and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:31633:71"/>
Moral, for obtaining ſuch an end ultimate (in ſome reſpect) and immediate; as for example, when men ſtrike a Ball with a Club, or throw a Boul to a hole, they are guided therein rationally, as they are in coming down a Stair; and they act therein, as in other things by ſecond cauſes and uſe of means, whether of Body or mind; but in theſe <hi>Lotting</hi>-Games it is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o, for all is caſt and hung upon extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary providence, even as if a man, who cannot, would be take himſelf to ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in, or walking upon the Water, when an other betaketh himſelf to a Bridge, or to a Boat.</p>
               <p>In ſum: As <hi>Lots</hi> and Oaths are much for one end, to wit, the ending of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie and ſtrife. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 18. So ought the ſame Rules almoſt to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in them both. Then 1. Before the <hi>Lot</hi> we ſhould look to and follow Gods call, and depend on him in it. 2. In the time of <hi>Lotting,</hi> we ſhould act reverently. 3. After the <hi>Lot</hi> we ſhould reverence the Lord, and ſubmit to the event of it as to his mind, even though our frame has not been ſo right: As an Oath bindeth when taken in lawful matter, though there hath been raſhneſs as to the manner, by vertue of Gods Name which is interpoſed; So do <hi>Lots.</hi> Becauſe how ever we be as to our frame, it is He who decideth as to the event; therefore ought that deciſion to be looked on as moſt Sacred; God having thought good beſide the general rules in his Word to give evidence of his mind by <hi>Lots,</hi> as to ſome particular events; and though theſe Games at Dice or Cards may in the compleat frame of them require ſome skill, how to manage ſuch throws or ſuch particular Cards when a man hath gotten them; yet that, that-throw is ſuch, caſting up ſo many blacks and no more, that ſuch a man hath ſuch Cards and no other, that is meerly by immediate provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſo muſt of neceſſity be a <hi>Lot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or it is by ſome other means which would (if aſſaid) wrong God alſo very much: And though skill may poſſibly influence the event as to the upſhot of the Game, yet in theſe throwings or ſhufflings the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This is ſtill to be underſtood as to ſome particular fact or event, and not in a common Tract, or for the determination of a general Truth; as for example, <hi>Mary</hi> believed that Chriſt was to be born, but knew not that she was to be his Mother; but <hi>Zacharias, John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> Father, did (it ſeemeth) doubt of Gods power, or of the event or Truth of what was told to him; and therefore he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſeeking a ſign when the other did not: The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> ſinned moſt groſly, when they ſent back the Ark and did hang the Deciſion of that queſtion, whether then plagues came from the hand of God, or by chance, upon the motion of the Kine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. And it is alwayes a ſinful tempting of God, when men out of curioſity from unbelief, or needleſly, put him to give a ſign that they may thereby know his power, will, or wiſdom.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Obſervation</hi> is, when we gather ſuch a thing from ſuch a providence that occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth without any fore-caſting of ours, or determining with our ſelves before hand about it, being a meerly ſurpriſing unexpected Emergent: we shall only ſay in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concerning <hi>Omens,</hi> and <hi>Obſervations,</hi> that when they agree not with the Word, and our Duty revealed and injoyned therein, they are not to be adventured on nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, but utterly ſlighted, becauſe then certainly they degenerate and become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant; neither are the examples of ſuch who being led by an extraordinary Spirit have uſed them, to be followed by others who have not the ſame Spirit: doubtleſs it is ſafe for us to take heed to the more ſure word of Propheſie, and to follow the uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rule of the Word of God, and not extraordinary examples for which we have no warrant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Superſtitious Obſervations</hi> are not ſo much about daily occurring providences, which all are obliged piouſly to mark and improve to the beſt ſpiritual advantage, and in the careful marking and ſuitable improving whereof, there lyeth a ſpecial piece of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wiſdom, more eſpecially of ſuch providences which may, from the Lord, help either to confirm a man in his Duty, or deterr him from a ſin or ſnare; as they are about ſome ſet and marked actions of Creatures, and theſe very fechleſs and ſilly too (though I deny not, but that ſimply they are providences alſo) which are reputed to be ſo many fixed Rules and Canons of natural wiſdom, but really inſtituted Spells, or Freets, or the Devils Rudiments and Grammar (to ſay ſo) to ſink mens minds into <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> And <hi>Obſervations</hi> are alwayes ſuperſtitious, when we collect and conclude that ſuch and ſuch events evil or good, will happen to us, or befall us from ſuch and ſuch occurring works and paſſages of providence, for which no reaſon can be drawn either out of the Word of God, or out of the courſe of nature; in a word, for which there is neither Scripture-warrant, nor can any natural cauſe or reaſon be aſſigned; as for inſtance, To think, it is unlucky to meet ſuch and ſuch Perſons firſt in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (which uſeth to be called an evil foot) for a Woman with child to ſtep over a <hi>Hair-teather,</hi> for Folks to neeſe putting on their Shoes, for one to have Salt falling toward him on the Table (the fear whereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maketh ſome to ſuffer no Salt to com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Of this ſort, or very like them is, Folks meeting with ſuch a word in ſuch a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which may have ſome alluſion, or ſeeming anſwerableneſs to a caſe, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, formerly dark, or doubtful to them, which they take for clearing of them, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of the thing without due examination thereof, according to the true meaning of the Scripture, and the Analogy of Faith: And their having ſuch a place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture brought to their mind, or at the firſt opening of the Bible caſt up to them, which they look on as more befitting their condition, and that becauſe ſo ſuggeſted and caſt up, without pondering the word it ſelf: and lay more weight on that word on that very account for ſolving of ſuch a doubt, and for clearing and determining them as to ſuch a thing, then on any other having the ſame Authority, and no leſs, and it may be much more ſuitableneſs to the thing, without any further tender and ſerious ſcrutiny, as if that were of ſpecial and extraordinary Revelation of Gods mind to them thereabout; which is a moſt dangerous practiſe. And (as we diſcourſed before on the practical breaches of the ſecond Command) is to make a Weerd or Fortune-Book of the Book of God, which he never appointed for ſuch an end; again I ſay, a moſt dangerous practiſe, and yet too frequently incident to ſome Religious Perſons, eſpecially in their trouble aud difficulty, whereof ſome ſtupendious inſtances might be given, which would fright all from ever daring any more to adventure on ſuch a practiſe not bottomed on the Word it ſelf, which God hath certainly given to his people to be uſed by them with Chriſtian prudence, according to its own principles, and not to be lotted with, or to have their ſtate or condition, or the deciſion of what they are dark or doubtful about, at hap-hazard caſt on it, according to their own groundleſs fancies and imaginations.</p>
               <p>We come now to the threatning or certification wherewith this Command is preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>The Lord will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh His Name in vain.</hi> In which, three things are contained: 1. The fearfulneſs and terribleneſs of the Judgement and Punishment, whereby the Lord will avenge the breach of this Command. 2. The Extent of it, as to every particular individual perſon ſound guilty, <hi>the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs.</hi> Him, whoever he be, whatever he be; if there were but one, he shall not eſcape; and if there be many, not one of them shall be miſſed or paſſed by in this reckoning. 3. There is the peremptorineſs and infallible certainty of it, God will not be diſſwaded from it, nor will he alter this Sentence, but it muſt and shall ſtand againſt him.</p>
               <p>The punishment is implyed in that, <hi>Not to be holden guiltneſs,</hi> wherein there is more contained then is expreſſed, implying theſe Three: 1. That he shal not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given nor abſolved, and ſo shall never enjoy Gods favour and friendship, which no man, who hath ſinned, can without pardon, enjoy; thus the Judgement is nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to be underſtood, He shall never enter into Heaven, nor ſee the Face of God, if he repent not. 2. Poſitively it implyeth that he shall be found guilty, and shall be dealt with as a guilty perſon, that he shall be eternally condemned, shut out from Gods preſence, and caſt into Hell to be there tormented for ever
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:31633:73"/>
and ever. 3. Eminently it implyeth a very high degree of puniſhment, that the degree ſhal be eminent, and that in reſpect of other ſins this ſin ſhall have a peculiar weight added unto its Curſe, and be ranked amongſt thoſe ſins which ſhall be in the Juſtice of God moſt ſeverely puniſhed; a particular inſtance, and proof whereof, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The peremptorineſs is implyed in theſe words, <hi>The Lord will not bold him guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the Lord will not,</hi> &amp;c. which implyeth. 1. That Sinners ſhall be reckoned with and judged for ſin, in which reckoning this ſin ſhall be eſpecially taken notice of. 2. That all Sinners ſhall be ſummoned to appear before the Judgement-Sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If any ask, How this <hi>Threatning</hi> is to be underſtood? for <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ſhould diſtinguiſh betwixt ſuch, who repenting for it, do by Faith in Chriſt make peace with God, and others who continue in it without repentance: and ſo ſay. 1.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:31633:73"/>
this account, that it pardoned him who was a <hi>Blaſphemer:</hi> As for ſuch who never betake themſelves for pardon, nor obtain mercy, it has theſe effects; 1. It ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth their Conſcience lyable to the ſore and grievous challenge of this ſin, and to the plain and ſharp threatning that is pronounced againſt it, which being deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and God himſelf much wronged thereby, cannot but bite, nay, gnaw the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſo much the more. 2. Juſtice hath a clear ground to proceed upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, not only as Sinners in general, but as guilty of this ſin in particular, and ſo becauſe of it, in a ſpecial manner lyable to wrath. 3. An eminent degree of wrath in Hell; for as there are different degrees of torment in Hell, ſo this ſin, no doubt, will make thoſe who are guilty of it, ſhare of that torment in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. 4. That it further hardeneth and incapacitateth for pardon (though not ſimply) the perſons that are guilty of it.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, Why this ſin is ſo threatned and puniſhed even beyond other ſins?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe it is accompanied with the moſt hainous aggravations, and ſo draweth on the greateſt guilt; As 1. It is a ſin immediately againſt God himſelf, and is not, as ſins of the ſecond Table, nay not as other particular ſins of the firſt Table, whereby men divert from God to Idolatry, giving to Idols what is his due, or turn their back on him, or ſlight his commanded worſhip, as in the firſt, ſecond, and fourth Commands; but this doth immediately and directly, and by commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on terminate on God himſelf moſt daringly and preſumptuouſly, as it were baffling and affronting him who has made himſelf known by his Name. 2. It is the fruit, ſign, or ſymptome, yea, and cauſe of the moſt groſs Atheiſm in the heart, and enmity againſt God; for it is his Enemies property <hi>to take his Name in vain,</hi> Pſalm 139. 20. It cannot be in the heighth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but where Atheiſm is, and the awe of God is not; and where there is much of it, there is proportionably much Atheiſm; it ſpeaketh forth plainly, that there is no right knowledge or faith of his Greatneſs, Holineſs, Power, Juſtice, &amp;c. which would make men fear him, and ſtand in awe of him; hence ordinarily thoſe who are groſs in this, are other wayes groſs in many other things; for it fitteth and diſpoſeth for Atheiſm, and it inureth and habituateth a man to contemn and deſpiſe God, whereas, on the contrary, if a man make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of any thing, it will be of this. 3. It is that which diſhonoureth God moſt amongſt others, and giveth them occaſion to blaſpheme, as <hi>Davids</hi> ſin did, and as thoſe falſe Prophets and Seducers with their followers are ſaid to do, 2 <hi>Petr.</hi> 2. verſe 1, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and where this prevaileth, all Religion is accounted among ſuch, but as a fancy and nothing, and therefore he will puniſh it ſeverely. 4. It is often and moſt ordinarily the guilt of ſuch as acknowledge God in profeſſion, but in works deny him, and do not worſhip him as God: It is againſt light and convictions, yea, and profeſſions of an intereſt in God; therefore, there is an emphaſis here, The Name of the <hi>Lord thy God.</hi> 5. It is not ſo of infirmity, as other ſins, which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or profit may puſh men on to; there is ordinarily here none of theſe, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimple Atheiſme; or prophane cuſtome that maketh it ſo much the worſe, that it is cuſtomary.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon why the Lord thus threatneth and puniſheth that ſin, is that he may thereby vindicate his own Holineſs, and imprint the awe and terribleneſs of this great and dreadful Name <hi>the Lord our God,</hi> upon the hearts of all, it being
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:31633:74"/>
one of the greateſt benefits beſtowed, or which can be beſtowed upon men, to wit the manifeſtation of the Name of God, when it cometh to be abuſed (being the abuſe of the beſt thing, and ſo the greateſt abuſe) it is the more ſeverely avenged, and thus one way or other the Lord will have his Holineſs and Greatneſs known amongſt all his Creatures; and therefore, whoſoever shall think little of his bleſſed and Holy Name here, and thereupon baffle and prophane it, God shall make them think more of it hereafter, when he riſeth up to take Vengeance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſo threatneth and punisheth it, becauſe men take a liberty and latitude in it, in formal Praying, rash Swearing, Jeſtings, Writings, Tenents, Diſputes, Plays, by Lots, &amp;c. and therefore he putteth the greater ſtamp of his Indignation on it, either to reſtrain them from that liberty, or to make them ſmart for it; and men alſo but very ſeldom ſeverely punish it, therefore He himſelf will.</p>
               <p>If any should ask the cauſe, why men do ordinarily take ſo little notice of this Command, and ſo generally ſin againſt it? I confeſs it may be at the firſt wondered at, conſidering that it has ſuch peremptory threatnings, and is very often followed, even here in this World, and in the ſight of men, with shame and viſible judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that there is ordinarily no profit, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> credit, nor any ſuch ſatisfaction to carnal luſts or pleaſures to tempt and push on to it, as are to other ſins; and that yet, notwithſtanding all this, men should ſo frequently ſin this way, muſt be alſo as wonderfull as it is abominable. But we may conceive it to proceed from theſe Cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Much Atheiſm, and the little heart-eſteem that there is of God, and of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; the little Faith that there is of his dreadful juſtice, and ſevere and peremptory execution of his threatnings; little of theſe within, maketh men careleſs to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and what wonder if this break forth, when in his heart the man ſayeth; There is no God; then this followeth, as is clear, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 37. in <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> who when once he ſaith, <hi>Who is the Lord,</hi> then he treadeth on his Name.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a natural pride and ſtout-heartedneſs in men againſt God, flowing from the former, whereby they ſet their mouth againſt God, and think it is a piece of bravery not to ſtand in awe of him; and (as <hi>Goliah</hi> did) to defie the living God, and to contemn and trample upon all Religion and Holineſs which appears ſooner and more clearly in nothing, then in ſtout words againſt the Lord, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 13. and in prophaning of his Name; hence it is to be obſerved, that where this ſin reigneth, there is either a height of deſperate ſecurity and ſtupid ſenſeleſneſs, or a devillish gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry in contemning God and all Religion, all Prayer, and other ſpiritual exerciſes as not becoming pretty men, or men of ſpirits; as if, forſooth, topping with God, and bidding a defiance to the Almighty, were true knowledge, and the grand proof of a brave and gallant ſpirit, and of a pretty man: O! what a dreadful length is this that men are come? to ſay in effect, Who is the Lord, that I should reverence his Name?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Devil knowing well both theſe, taketh occaſion to ſtir men up to it; and what by offering occaſions of irritation to vent their paſſion, and what by habituating them to it from cuſtome, and the example of others, whereby keeping them off ſome other ſins which others may be guilty of, he is in Gods righteous Judgement permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to harden them in this.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There may be alſo ſomething in the nature of this ſin, becauſe it doth not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily wrong others externally, or becauſe it may be in a truth, or in profeſſion of duty, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in worship; or becauſe it may be fallen into inadvertantly without fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought or deliberation; therefore the Devil hath the greater advantage to drive
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:31633:74"/>
men on to it, if not by ſwearing falſly, yet prophanely and raſhly; if not by God, yet by ſome Creature; or if not ſo, yet by formal and fruitleſs diſcharging of duties, or by ſome other way; and becauſe ordinarily there is no ſuch evil that ſticketh thereby to others, as to make them reſent it, nor no ill meant to themſelves, as they in their proud ſelf-love, do conceit; therefore they are the leſs affraid of it before, and the leſs challenged for it afterward.</p>
               <p>Let us make ſome uſe of all this in a few words. 1. Then ſee, and gravely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what ſin this is, what wrath it deſerveth, how far, and how wide in its guilt it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth it ſelf, and what ſevere reckoning will be for it? O then! what is your ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and what will be your ſentence when this Judgement ſhall be ſet, and when the Judge cometh to pronounce it? tell me, who of you will be able to purge your ſelves of this guilt? This Sentence may, and will one day make many of you to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when the Lord will ſay; <hi>Man, thou tookeſt my Name in vain in ſuch a Company; at ſuch a Play and Sport, in ſuch a Conteſt, in ſuch an Oath, yea, in ſuch a Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. Here is your Sentence, <hi>I will not hold you guiltneſs, but guilty for this cauſe;</hi> This, this is the Truth of God, if we believe his Word, yea, whether we believe it or not.</p>
               <p>Let me therefore ſpeak two words further to all of you, Old and young, Godly and Prophane, Rich and Poor, &amp;c. O take more notice of, this ſin, and be more watchful againſt it, think more of it, and look more to every way it may be fallen into; and by all means ſtudy to prevent it, fear to name <hi>the great and dreadful Name of the Lord our God</hi> irreverently; tremble when ye hear it named; and when ye read, hear, pray, or do any duty, as ye would eſchew this Curſe and Threatning, and be found guiltleſs in the day of the Lord, eſchew this ſin of taking his Name in vain.</p>
               <p>For helps to this, let me commend unto you, 1. A ſerious endeavour to walk under the impreſſion of Gods greatneſs, and to have your heart filled with his awe; if his fear be in the heart, there will be expreſſions of reverence to his Name in the mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Believe, and be perſwaded of the reality of this Truth concerning the terrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the reckoning for this ſin, and the fearful Judgement that will certainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Uſe and mention his Name reverently in Prayer, Hearing, Conference, &amp;c. For, habituating our ſelves to formality in ſuch duties, maketh way ordinarily for more groſs violations of this commands; and ſtudy to be more affected even when narratively ye are telling ſomething wherein his Name is mentioned, then otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Tremble at this ſin, and ſuitably reſent it; when ye hear it in others, be affected with it, and labour to make them ſo, that ye may thus train your ſelves to an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating of that evil.</p>

This Fourth pointeth out the Time which moſt ſolemnly the Lord will have ſet apart for his Worſhip, that ſo He, who is both Lord of us, and of our time, may ſhew what ſhare he has reſerved as a Tribute due to himſelf, who hath liberally vouchſafed on us the reſt; which time is not to be underſtood excluſively, as if he would have onely that ſpent in worſhip (there being no excluſive determination of the frequency of the exerciſes of worſhip, or duration of them in Scripture, that is to ſay, that they ſhall be ſo long and ſo often, and no longer, nor oftner) but that he will preciſely have this time as an acknowledgement from us, even as when he gave <hi>Adam</hi> the uſe of all the Trees in the Garden, he reſerved one; ſo when he giveth ſix dayes to us, he keepeth a ſeventh for himſelf.</p>
               <p>This Command is placed in a manner betwixt the two Tables, becauſe it is a tranſition as it were from the one to the other, and containeth in it duties of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Service to God, and of Charity towards men, and ſo in ſome ſort ſerveth to reconcile (if we may ſpeak ſo) the two Tables, and to knit them together, that ſo their harmony may be the more clearly ſeen: It is alſo more largely and fully ſet down for plurality and variety of expreſſions and words, then any other in either of the Tables; yet hath it notwithſtanding, been in all times in a ſpecial manner aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſet upon, and endeavours uſed to overturn it: Satan aiming ſometimes to darken the meaning of it, ſometimes to looſe from the ſtrict tye of obſerving it, and that not onely by old <hi>Sabbatarians, Anti-ſabbatarians,</hi> and corrupt School men, but even by thoſe whom God hath made Orthodox in the main; And eſpecially by a Generation in theſe dayes, who having a hatred at all Ordinances, and at all the Commands of the Decalogue, yet do eſpecially vent it againſt this Command; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in it is contained a main foundation of Godlineſs. As it is wonderfully great preſumption for men to aſſault and ſet upon Gods Authority, even where he hath ſtrengthned himſelf (as it were) moſt, by more full explication, and more large and particular preſſing of duty, and forbidding of the contrary ſin, as he hath done in this Command, more then in any of all the reſt; So it will be neceſſary before we can ſpeak to the practical part of piety comprehended in it, concerning the ſanctification of the Chriſtian Sabbath, or Lords day, either in the negative or poſitive part of it, to ſpeak doctrinally (for clearing of the precept) to theſe three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether this Command be moral, and do oblige us in its Letter as other Commands do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is the particular morality of it, and the literal meaning of the words.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How our Lords day ſtandeth in reference to this Command? and whether thereby the ſame ſanctification be required as to it, though its inſtitution ariſe from another ground, then is required to the Seventh-day Sabbath? Somewhat of all theſe muſt needs be ſpoken unto, and we begin to ſpeak firſt of its morality before we ſpeak of its meaning, becauſe all dependeth on this, both in reſpect of expoſition and practiſe; for if it be not moral and perpetually binding, it's not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary either to explicate it, or to ſtudy and preſs the practiſe of it; but if it be found to be moral, then no doubt it concerneth us, and requireth the ſame moral ſanctification of a day now as it did before.</p>
               <p>Our Aſſertion then in reference to this is, that, The duty of ſetting apart and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:31633:76"/>
ſanctifying of a portion of time; as it is limited in the fourth Command, for Gods ſervice as it recurreth, is moral, and the Obligation thereunto perpetual, even as in the duties of the other Commands; the obligation to this, being no more diſſolved then to thoſe, though there may be difference in the degree of the obligation which they lay on in reſpect of the matter contained in them; my meaning in a word, is, that a day o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> one of ſeven is as neceſſary to be kept holy unto God now, (upon ſuppoſition of his determining the particular day) as it is neceſſary to hold and keep up the worship preſcribed by God; neither without ſin can another day be put in the room of it, more then other worship can be ſubſtituted in the place of divinely preſcribed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; for the time is ſet and fixt by the fourth Command (pointing at a ſolemne and chief time) as the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ship it ſelf is by the ſecond.</p>
               <p>For clearing of this, conſider, 1. That we mean not here moral-natural, as if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any poſitive Law, ſuch a thing had been binding; no, but moral-poſitive, that is laid on by a Command which is ſtanding unrepealed, and ſo bindeth by vertue of the authority of the Law-giver, as ſeveral other commands and precepts do; as namely, thoſe concerning Sacraments, belonging to the ſecond Command, and thoſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Wife, and forbidden degrees of Marriage belonging to the ſeventh; which being ſo often broken by many Saints, and diſpenſed with in ſome caſes, cannot be thought to be morally naturally ſince the Lord diſpenſeth not ſo in theſe, nor can it be thought in reaſon, that his Servants would have been ignorant of ſuch a natural thing: It is then moral-poſitive that we mean, to wit, that which is binding by a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider in this queſtion, that there is a great difference betwixt theſe two, to ſay the ſeventh-day Sabbath which the <hi>Jews</hi> kept, is moral, and to ſay the four<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h Command is moral; the one may be, and is abolished, becauſe another is brought in its room: The other, to wit, the Command may ſtand, and doth ſtand, becauſe it tyeth morally to a ſeventh day, but ſuch a ſeventh day as the Lord should ſucceſſively diſcover to be choſen by him; and though the ſeventh be changed, yet one of ſeven is ſtill reſerved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is need to diſtinguish betwixt the moral ſubſtance of a Command, and ſome ceremonial appendices belonging to it: So the fourth Command might thea poſſibly have had ſomething ceremonial in the ſeventh day, or in the manner uſed of ſanctifying that ſeventh day, which now is gone as double Sacrifice, &amp;c. or in its reaſons whereby it is preſſed; (as there is ſomething peculiar to that People in the Preface, to all the Commands) as there was in the Sacraments of the old Law belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſecond Command; yet both a Sabbath-day and Sacraments may be, and are very neceſſary and moral in the Church; it is not then every thing hinging on this Command, as proper to that adminiſtration, and ſo but accidental to the ſanctifying of a Sabbath, that we plead for; but this is it we plead for, that the Command is, as to its main ſcope, matter, and ſubſtance, moral-poſitive, and that it ſtandeth as ſtill bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and obliging unto us, and cannot without ſin be neglected or omitted; it might be enough here to ſay, that if this Command were never repealed in the ſubſtance of it, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It ſaith that a day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s moral and neceſſary. 2. It ſaith a day of ſeven is moral and neceſſary, which is all
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:31633:76"/>
we ſay; and why neceſſary? as agreeable to this Command no doubt; whence we may Argue, if the ſubſtance of this Command be kept even when the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar day is changed, then is the Command moral (which this very change confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) but the former is true, as is clear in experience; therefore it followeth that the Law ſtands unrepealed; for its palpable that the day, as to its number or fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, and duration, with the manner of ſanctifying of it, belongs to the ſubſtance of the Commandment, but what day as to its order, firſt, ſecond, or ſeventh doth not, becauſe the firſt cometh in immediately upon Religion, Gods Honour, and the good of Souls, which the other doth not: This Argument will ſtand good againſt all who acknowledge this Law, to have been once given by God, till they can evidence a repeal.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak ſomewhat more particularly to this, the way we ſhal make out the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of it, is by conſidering, 1. How the Scripture ſpeaketh of it in general. 2. How it ſpeaketh of the Decalogue. 3. How it ſpeaketh of this Command in particular. 4. By adducing ſome Scriptural Arguments for it; As for the 1. To wit, the Scriptures ſpeaking of it in general, we ſay, If the Scripture ſpeak as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in clearing the fourth Command, or the Sabbath (which is the morality of it) and preſs it as ſeriouſly, and that in reference to all times of the Church, as it doth any other moral duty; then for ſubſtance this Command is moral and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually binding, (for that ſeemeth to be the Character whereby moſt ſafely to conclude concerning a Command, to conſider how the Scripture ſpeaketh of it,) but the Scripture doth as often mention, and is as much, and as ſerious in preſſing of that Command, and that in reference to all ſtates of the Church as of any other, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.

the change of the particular day. Yet Thirdly, it is clear that from the mentioning of theſe ſervices this will follow, that there ſhould be ſet and fixed Ordinances, and a way of worſhip in the New Teſtament, as well as in the Old, and that there ſhould be a ſolemn chief ſet-time for the Sabbath which men ought to ſanctifie, and that they ſhould no more admit any other times, not ſo ſet apart into a parity with it, then they were to admit any ſervice or Worſhip not allowed by God, or that was contrary to the ſecond Command: for if any thing be clear in them, this is clear, that they ſpeak firſt of ſervices, then of ſolemn times and Sabbaths, and of the one after the other, which muſt certainly infer, that both external ſervices, and a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn chief time for them, do belong to the New Teſtament; Hence it is that many Divines (from that Propheſie of <hi>Ezekiel)</hi> do draw concluſions for ſundry things out of thoſe places, as 1. Concerning the neceſſity and continuance of a ſtanding Miniſtry, and though Miniſters now be neither Prieſts nor Levites, yet (ſay they,) it followeth clearly, that there will be a Miniſtry, becauſe ſuch are ſpoken of there. 2. Concerning the neceſſity of, and a Warrant for Church-Diſcipline, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not only doctrinally, but diſciplinarily the precious from the vile, and debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of thoſe who are Morally unclean from the Ordinances: becauſe theſe things (ſay they) are Typified in the ſubſtance by the Porters being ſet to keep the Doors, and by the charge given to the Prieſts. 3. Anent the continuance of a Church, and of the Ordinances of Word, Sacraments, &amp;c. And the Congregating of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to attend theſe, though there ſhall be no material or Typical Temple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>al things there being expreſſed and propheſied of, under the names of the old Levitical ſervices; yet could not a warrant be inferr'd from them for theſe, (and that <hi>Jure Divine)</hi> if the things were not Morally to bind, which were ſo ſigni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Hence I argue, if the ſanctifying of a Sabbath as a piece of worſhip to God be propheſied of to belong to the New Teſtament, then are we bound to the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a Sabbath as a neceſſary duty; but the continuance of ſanctifying a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath unto God is ſpecially propheſied of, and fore-told as a piece of worſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Teſtament, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The third place is <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20. <hi>Pray that your flight be not in the Winter,</hi> neither on the Sabbath-day, where the Lord inſinuateth, that as travelling is troubleſome to the Body in Winter; ſo would it be to the minds of the Godly (for he is now ſpeaking to his Diſciples alone) to Travel on that day, ſpecially and ſolemnly ſet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

not the other Feſtivals of the Jews which were to be kept holy alſo, and by this he diſtinguiſheth the ordinary Sabbath from thoſe other dayes, and oppoſeth it to many, as being now the only Holy-day on which they ſhould eſchew, if poſſible, to travel; and would therefore pray to have it prevented: for in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Sabbath ſpoken of as the ſolemn time for worſhip is ever meaned of the weekly Sabbath, and other Holy dayes are called the firſt or laſt day of the Feaſt, and therefore if the Lords meaning were that they ſhould pray, <hi>that their flight might not be on any of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Holy dayes,</hi> to mention the weekly Sabbath only, would not be ſufficient for that end.</p>
               <p>To ſay that it was for fear of ſcandal, that they ſhould pray not to be put to flye, will not remove the former reaſons; beſides at that time the Apoſtles and other Chriſtians had given up with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſtood not on ſcandal in ſuch things in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to them, on whom, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wrath had come to the uttermoſt, and who were not infirm but malitious, and ſo in reſpect of offence to be dealt with as the Lord did with the Phariſees; and therefore, all things being conſidered, it appeareth from our Lords words, that a Sabbath among Chriſtians was to be ſanctified 40. years, or thereabout, after his death, which proveth that the Scripture mentioneth a Sabbath to be ſanctified under the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>We come unto the ſecond way of making out the Morality of this Command, to wit, by ſhewing how the Scripture ſpeaketh of the whole Decalogue, and thus we reaſon:</p>
               <p n="1">1. If all the Commandments of the Decalogue be Moral, then muſt this be ſo alſo; for it is one of them; and if it were not moral and binding, there would not now be <hi>Ten words</hi> (as they are called by the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 4.) but Nine onely, which at firſt bluſh, will and cannot but ſeem ſtrange and abſurd to thoſe who have from Gods Word drunk in that number: But all theſe are moral and binding, as is granted by all, (except the Papiſts who deny the ſecond, and therefore ſcore it out of their Catechiſms.) And that they muſt be all alike moral and binding, may be made out, theſe two waves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All of them in the Old Teſtament had alike Authority, Priviledges, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, which neither the Judicial nor Ceremonial Law had, as 1. To be diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounced by God himſelf, without adding more, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 22. 2. To be written by his own finger in Tables of ſtone, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 18. 3. To be laid up and kept in the Ark, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 16. And if theſe and other Prerogatives did put a difference, and ſhew a difference to be put betwixt the other nine Commands, and all Judicial or Ceremonial Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Why not betwixt them, and this alſo? 2. In the New Teſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are all alike confirmed; when the Law in general is ſpoken of, none of them is excepted, and therefore this Command is neceſſarily included.</p>
               <p>For which we would look firſt to that place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 17. Where our Lord in a ſpecial manner intendeth to vindicate the Moral Law of this fourth, and to preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> tranſgreſſor of that, and eſpecially of this Command in it (for that Sermon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And his ſcope is to wipe off that imputation, and how? by ſhewing that He ſtill preſſeth the Moral Law, even beyond what the Phariſees did. 2. It was the Moral Law eſpecially, which the Phariſees corrupted, and whereof he undertaketh the Vindication, and it is Holineſs in Obedience to that which he preſſeth as neceſſary beyond what the Scribes and Phariſees did; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was in that Law they failed mainly, and not in the Ceremonial Law. 3. The offence and miſtake that Chriſt is to preoccupie and rectifie amongſt his Hearers, requireth this: for many of them fancied that by the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> there ſhould be a Relaxation from the duties of Holineſs called for in the Moral Law; and therefore, ſaith he, think not ſo; now a Relaxation from ſome other Laws might have been thought of warrantably. 4. It is ſuch a Law whereof to teach the Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation at any time is ſinful &amp; pernicious, therefore it is certainly the Moral Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We reaſon thus, when he ſpeaketh of the Law, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or by way of eminency (meaning no doubt the Decalogue.) He ſpeaketh alike of all its Commandments, even of the leaſt of them and ſo of this. 4. Alſo <hi>that he came not to deſtroy it,</hi> which yet the Lord never did of Ceremonials, but rather fore-told the Abolition of them, as he did of the ſeeking and worſhipping of God in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, when he cleareth the Doctrine of the Sabbath from the Phariſees corrupting Traditions, he doth never weaken its former Obligation, nor inſinuate its weakneſs, but ſheweth the true meaning thereof, which from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning made it not only conſiſtent with the works of piety and mercy, but excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly helpful to both.</p>
               <p>A ſecond place, Confirming the whole Decalogue (or rather aſſerting its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,) is in the Epiſtle of <hi>James, Jam.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>He that offendeth in one, is guilty of all:</hi> Why! Becauſe he is the ſame God, and Law-giver (and no Servant nor Angel) who ſpake them all, one as well as another of them: And it being clear there, that he ſpeaketh of the Decalogue, called the <hi>Royal Law;</hi> (there being no Law inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in; nor any other, that can be of a like authority, in theſe Laws inſtanced, but onely it; nor that could be pleaded for, by <hi>James,</hi> on ſuch grounds, in ſuch a time,) and it being alſo clear, That he giveth to all thoſe Laws, which the Lord ſpake at that time, alike Authority; (otherwiſe, his reaſoning would not be good, if any one Law or Command, could be inſtanced to him, of the Ten, which the Lord ſpake, and was abrogated, and not binding) it neceſſarily followeth, that this fourth Command, being one of the Ten, muſt be of equal Authority with the reſt.</p>
               <p>It may be noted alſo, That <hi>James</hi> here doth not, (as neither doth our Lord, nor any of his Apoſtles, when they cite the Law) give New Authority to the Laws he citeth; but ſuppoſeth them to have it already; and maketh uſe of them, as Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the thing he preſſed, which could not be, if their Authority depended on, or ſlowed from the preſent Citation of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we reaſon further thus; Either there is ſome Moral duty, contained in this Command, and laid on by it; which is not in any of the former: or there is but ſome Ceremonial thing in it, reducible to one of them: For, the Perfection of this Law requireth, that all things needful to the Worſhip of God, ſhould be ſummed in it, and the ſcope thereof, which is, briefly to compend all requireth
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:31633:79"/>
there ſhould be nothing in it, that's needleſs, ſuperfluous, or that might have bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> left out.</p>
               <p>Now if the matter be Moral; not contained in any former Command, then is the Command it ſelf Moral; ſeeing a Moral ſubſtance, and Matter denominateth the Command ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea, it muſt be Moral, otherwiſe ſomething Morally neceſſary to Gods ſervice, (ſuch as the determination of its chief time) ſhould be omitted. It may be aſſumed, yet further: It muſt be Moral, (be it what it will) to eſchew a Tautology in this ſhort Compend of Duties; and that, of Moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties too.</p>
               <p>Again, If it be not Moral, but contain ſome Ceremonial thing reducible to one of the three former Commands: Then 1. It might have been put amongſt other Ceremonials. 2. Other Ceremonials might have been put in with it: Or. 3. A Reaſon given, Why all are not Reducible to ſome Moral Command. 4. If the matter of this be Reducible to another Command, then can it not be accounted a diſtinct Command, neither ought it here to have been given as ſuch, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to ſome other; as the Servants and Beaſts reſting, is ſub-joyned to this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. It would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hewn to what Command it's Reducible as to the ſubſtance of it, if it be Ceremonial: 6. A Reaſon would be given, Why amongſt Ten, One<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and onely One, is ſet down, ſo far different from all the reſt. And if all theſe Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities follow the Denyal of it's ſubſtance to be Moral; then, for eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, we muſt conclude it to be Moral: and ſo the fourth Command is Moral.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we reaſon thus; If it be not Moral, it muſt either be Judicial, or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, for the matter and ſubſtance of it; but it is not Judicial: that is, it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not to External Policy, and Civil Society, principally and eſpecially, in that one Nation, becauſe no ſuch duties are comprehended, at leaſt Primarily, in any Command of the firſt Table; but in the ſecond, which teacheth Duties to others, as this firſt, doth to God: Neither is it Ceremonial; For, All Ceremonies, that are Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical, have their riſe ſince the fall, and relate ſome way to Chriſt to come. But this of ſanctifying one Day of ſeven, had it's riſe in the ſtate of innocency, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> before he fell, and therefore cannot be called Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial properly, more then the Command of a Man's leaving Father and Mother, and cleaving to his Wife, ſo that they two ſhould be one fleſh, which the Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. maketh uſe of. Beſides, if it were Ceremonial in the ſubſtance, then were it Typical and ſignificant of ſome thing to come, which is hard to ſhew: Then alſo had it not been Lawful to have retained it; for Ceremonials now in their uſe are not only dead, but deadly: But this Morality, in ſubſtance the ſame with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which we plead for, was retained by the Apoſtles, and primitive Church; (to ſav no more) Therefore it is not Ceremonial: And ſo this Law muſt needs be Moral.</p>
               <p>To ſay, That the Command is partly Moral, partly Ceremonial; if we reſpect it's ſubſtance, will not hold: For, 1. There is no ſuch other Law. 2. That were to make Confuſion, betwixt Ceremonials, and Morals; which it ſeemeth, the Lord himſelf hath aimed and reſolved to keep clearly diſtinct. 3. What ever be Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial; That which was allowed, and injoyned to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may agree with Him, under the Goſpel, cannot be Ceremonial: For, neither
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:31633:79"/>
of theſe States are capable, of proper Ceremonies; but both agree on a ſeventh Day. Therefore, it is not Ceremonial.</p>
               <p>The third way, we make out the Morality of this Command, is, By particular conſidering of it ſelf; and here we argue thus:</p>
               <p>If it be not onely put into the Decalogue, with the other Moral Commands; but more ſingularly explicated and preſſed even in it then they; then it is certainly Moral; that is, perpetually Obligatory with the reſt, But ſo it is put and ſet down in the Decalogue; and preſſed even more then the reſt of the Commands, as on other accounts, ſo poſſibly on this; becauſe it's Ground is Poſitive, and Men need the more Words about it: Juſt as in the ſecond Command; <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. Now, that it is thus put, and preſſed; appeareth theſe ſeveral wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſhareth of all common Priviledges, with the reſt of the Commands, ſet down in the Decalogue, that were all ſpoken, yea, Written by the Lord imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, and laid up in the Ark.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is propoſed, and ſet down in it's Form, both Poſitively; <hi>Remember the Sabbath, to keep it Holy</hi> (and Negatively) <hi>in it thou ſhalt do no manner of work,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas all the other Commands, are but one of theſe wayes ſet down.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It hath the Particularity in it, that all the reſt have; to wit, To be in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Number; <hi>Thou ſhalt,</hi> &amp;c. To ſhew, That it ſpeaketh to every one in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; Yea though all the Commands, concern all Ranks, yet onely here are Son, Daughter, Man-ſervant, Maid-ſervant, and Stranger, expreſly mentioned, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a ſpecial Equity, holden out here in the proportioning of this time: There are ſix dayes given us, to Labour on; and therefore it is all the Reaſon in the World, that the Lord have the ſeventh: And if this Conceſſion of Gods, of ſix dayes to work on, be Moral, (For all the time is Gods; and we cannot, for our uſe, take any part of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>geſt Share: to wit, Six parts of ſeven:) Then muſt the ſetting a part of a ſeventh Day be Moral alſo: And ſo the Command it ſelf; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both are comprehended. <hi>viz.</hi> The ſixth given to us, and the ſeventh reſerved for him: they muſt needs ſtand and fall together: For they mutually put each other: Thou ſhalt labour ſix dayes, and reſt on the ſeventh: Thou ſhalt reſt on the Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>day, and Labour ſix.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This Day is claimed by the Lord, as a thing wherein he hath a ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety: Its the <hi>Lords day;</hi> for though he did give ſix, yet he reſerved a ſeventh. And can, or dare, any ſay, That he diſcharged that, or diſpenſed it away from Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to any other? If not, it muſt be His ſtill, and cannot without Sacriledge, be other wayes applyed.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Obedience to this Command, is preſſed by an exceeding weighty Reaſon, drawn from Gods own Example, which maketh it clearly Relative, to its firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. <hi>Geneſ</hi> 2. Where it is ſaid. That He reſted after ſix dayes Work, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Day: <hi>viz.</hi> the whole ſeventh day, and ſo ſhould we: which is the more effectual, for proving the Morality of this Command: Becauſe 1. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s a Reaſon that took place, even in innocency, and ſo reſpecteth no Type or Ceremony.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:31633:80"/>
2. It is Univerſal, belonging to all Men, who are God's Creatures: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince the Reaſon is perpetual, ſo muſt the Command be like-wiſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This Command alone, and beſide all others, is expreſly preſſed in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of it, not only on Maſters and Rulers for themſelves, but as taking bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on them, for all under them; and within their Families to endeavour the ſanctifying of the Lords day with them, and by them as well as by themſelves; whereby the extent of this Command is clearly and earneſtly holden forth in more expreſs terms, then in any other of all the Commands; though this be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in them alſo.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The obſervation of it is preſſed and encouraged unto, by a ſpecial bleſſing which He hath annexed to the time ſet a part by himſelf; <hi>He bleſſed it,</hi> that is, He made and ſtill maketh it uſeful and refreſhing as a ſpecial bleſſing to his people who keep his Ordinances, ſeeking Him therein: this day has a double portion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, beſide any other day, for his peoples Repoſe, Edification, Comfort, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of His Preſence, &amp;c. And to ſay now that this Solemn time were not moral, were to rob the Church of a great bleſſing; ſeeing this day, ſet a part by God for his Service, hath the bleſſing, beyond any other day commanded, on it; and in the experience of his People often hath it been found to be ſo.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It is ſpecially and ſingularly uſhered in with a <hi>Memento,</hi> or <hi>Remember,</hi> which is not expreſſed in any other Command; and, Shall we think, that where God ſaith <hi>Remember,</hi> there is nothing to be taken notice of; or, ſhall we think, that it ſaith not Remember now as well as then; and if ſo, Who can warrantably for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that which he biddeth remember? which is, not to keep the Seventh day, but the <hi>Sabbath</hi> holy unto the Lord: And may not all theſe Characters, put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one Command (ſo many not being to be found in all the other Commands if put together); May not all theſe, I ſay, convince us that it is the Lords purpoſe to have this Command ſtanding obligatory in its ſubſtance to the end of the world? Which is ſo preſſed, that if there be little help from Natures light, to determine the day, or to preſs its obſervation, it may be ſtrongly born in, by the more clear and weighty reaſons.</p>
               <p>And ſo we come to the fourth way propoſed for making out the morality of this Command, which is by adducing ſome Arguments drawn from Scripture.</p>
               <p>The firſt whereof is, If the Law bind under the New Teſtament, not only in reſpect of its matter, as its natural; nor only as it is repeated in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo by vertue of the Authority enacting it: then this Law of the fourth Command, though not explicitly determined by nature, and though it were not mentioned particularly in the New Teſtament, muſt be binding alſo, for it hath that ſame Authority: But the firſt is true, and is acknowledged generally by Divines (excepting a few) and is clear by Chriſt and his Apoſtles their citing of it, as ſuppoſing it to be binding: Therefore the laſt muſt be true alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> If this Command be founded on moral grounds, then it ſelf muſt be moral: But the grounds on which it is founded are moral: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. 1. It is moral that God ſhould have a ſolemn and chief ſet-time. 2. That he himſelf, and none other ſhould determine that time, ſeeing no other could do it and bleſs it. 3. Theſe reaſons in the Command it ſelf dividing time, into ſix parts of it to us, and a ſeventh part to God; and Gods reſting after ſix days working; with his
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:31633:80"/>
making only ſeven dayes in the week, and employing ſix of them to work, &amp;c. theſe reaſons, I ſay, are all moral and binding now as before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Arg.</hi> If all moral duties be contained in the ten Commands, then this Command muſt needs be moral: But the firſt is true: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. This Command containeth a moral duty, which is in none of the preceeding Commands; to wit, the ſtinting and determining of the ſolemn and chief time to be ſet a part for Gods worship, to be one day of ſeven. It is true, Time is commanded to be allowed to Gods worship in thoſe other Commands, wherein the duties of worship themſelves are commanded; for, worship cannot be performed more then any other duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome time; but that the chief time should be ſo much, and ſo often, is onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in this Command; from which it appeareth, 1. That an indefinit time of worship, or for it, is not the morality of this Command, becauſe this followeth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, as being ſuppoſed needful for the performance of every poſitive duty contained in the other Commands; its morality, therefore, muſt be, The determining of that definit time. 2. We may hence ſee a reaſon why there is no new Command for this in the New Teſtament; becauſe this ſtandeth in the Law; neither are, <hi>Thou shalt not Swear, Kill,</hi> &amp;c mentioned as new Commands more then this; ſo that, had they not been mentioned in the New Teſtament (as ſome are not) yet had they ſtill obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: It is juſt ſo as to this; and the reaſon why they are mentioned, may be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be, becauſe the main fault about them was defect and short coming, but in this it was exceſs, which our Lord alſo regulateth by holding forth the right obſervance of it, and clearing what was wrong, and ſo is ſuppoſed to confirm what he repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Arg.</hi> If it be not free for men to carve out Gods ſolemn chief time of worship at their pleaſure, then is this Command moral (for that liberty is reſtrained, by this Command and no other:) But it is not free for them to chooſe what time they pleaſe, or to carve it out: This ſeemeth to be only queſtionable, which is therefore thus confirmed.</p>

                  </gap>e to men to carve out what ſolemn and chief time is to be given to, and ſet apart for Gods worship; then, either it is free to them to chooſe no time at all, or it is free for them to chooſe a longer or a shorter then this: But neither of theſe can be ſaid: not the firſt as is clear; not the ſecond, becauſe it will not ſo quadrate with the end; for if the time be shorter, it incroacheth on Gods due; if it be longer, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croacheth on Gods conceſſion of ſix dayes to work in. If it be shorter, it incroacheth on Gods due (as is ſaid) and our ſouls good; if longer, it incroacheth on our temporal calling; and, Can any reſtrain man when God giveth him liberty?</p>
               <p>Again, If it be free to men ſo to cut and carve at pleaſure, on the ſolemn and chief time for Gods worship, its either free for all men together to agree on a day, even one and the ſame; or its free for each Country, or each man, to chooſe what day they pleaſe: but neither of theſe are either poſſible or practicable to edification: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt the day he determined to them: and if ſo, then ſure by this Command: And ſo its ſtill binding, and cannot in that reſpect be altered without ſin, which was the thing to be proved.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Arg.</hi> That there is a morality in a ſeventh day, we may argue from four famous and main Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>The 1. whereof, is the general practiſe of all Chriſtians (I ſay nothing of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,) Apoſtles, and generally all in the primitive times, have ever thought that one day of ſeven is to be obſerved, and have in leſs or more accordingly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:31633:81"/>
2. As the practiſe of all, ſo the Judgment and opinion (which is often more ſound then mens practiſes) of all, doth confirm it: Was there ever any Churches that did not in all their Catechiſms and Canons, take in this fourth Command with the reſt? do not all Writers, who comment on the Decalogue, comment on this Command, and urge the ſanctifying of the Lords day from it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take mens Conſciences for a third Witneſs, and it will be found that for no ſin, do they more frequently and more ſharply challenge, then for Prophaning of the Lords day: The Conſcience directly making uſe of this Command, and of the <hi>Memento,</hi> and other reaſons in it for aggravating of that ſin, when yet it will ſay nothing for the Seventh day; but this firſt-day of ſeven it preſſeth moſt exactly, neither will any reaſon alleaged againſt its morality quietit; and the more tender that Chriſtians be, the more will they find a preſſure of Conſcience for obedience to this Command; and the more eaſily will they be convinced of, and ſadly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged for the leaſt breach of this Command.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Gods Diſpenſations of Bleſſings or Plagues, eſpecially in ſpiritual things, bear witneſs to this Truth: Doth not experience tell us, that thoſe who make moſt Conſcience of keeping this Command, are often, yea, ever the moſt thriving Chriſtians as to univerſal holineſs and tenderneſs, and moſt near and intimate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God? and will not the unſutable ſanctification of but one Sabbath, or the interruption of their wonted ſeriouſneſs therein, giue them a ſore back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet? and on the contrary, doth it not appear that thoſe who are groſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender in this, are often groſs and untender in all manner of Converſation, and are followed with ſpiritual plagues of hardneſs, deadneſs, and Hypocriſie at the beſt, or elſe fall into groſs outward acts of prophanity, or into errours in judgment, which are the bad and ſad effects of prophaning this day, on them who prejudg themſelves of the bleſſing of it; and if the bleſſing of this Law continue, muſt not the Law it ſelf be moral and perpetually binding? the obedience whereof, hath this bleſſing perpetually more or leſs annexed to it, as the prophanation thereof hath uſually Plagues, at leaſt ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>There are ſome Objections that are moved againſt the morality of this Command; I ſhall ſpeak to three of them which are moſt inſiſted on.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Obj.</hi> This Law is not mentioned, as being renewed or confirmed, in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It's Authority dependeth not on the mentioning of it ſo in the New Teſtament: the Law is Gods Word, and hath its Authority as well as the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſome other clearly moral and binding Law had been omitted, or not mentioned in the New Teſtament, as there ſeemeth to be no palpable and expreſs Command againſt Images, though there be againſt will-worſhip; ſure, it is enough that it is not repealed in it, ſo it is here, as is ſaid.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sundry other poſitive Laws are binding, which are not mentioned in the New Teſtament, ſuch as theſe, For a man not to Marry his Siſter or his Aunt. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It will be found on the matter to be confirmed, when we ſhall ſee what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant there is for the Lords day, which is one of ſeven, and yet is clearly holden forth in the New Teſtament: But this Command, as alſo that relating to Idolatry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:31633:81"/>
are ſo little mentioned, becauſe the <hi>Jews,</hi> after the Captivity, were not ſo much in the defect of obedience to theſe Commands, but were rather diſpoſed to a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious exceſs, which maketh Chriſt often rectifie that abuſe of the fourth Command, but never to annull it. The third Command alſo anent Swearing, might be ſaid to be abrogated, becauſe it is not ſo poſitively aſſerted in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Obj.</hi> The Apoſtle, <hi>Rom,</hi> 14. 5, 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 10. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. ſeemeth to caſt away difference of times, eſpecially of Sabbath days; which could not be, if this Command were moral.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle cannot be underſtood ſimply to caſt away the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all days as a bondage, and ſo to make all times alike; For 1. That would contradict his own practiſe, and the practiſe of the other Apoſtles: for it is clear that they differenced the firſt day of the week from other dayes, and one day in ſpecial is called, The Lords-day, which other dayes of the week are not. 2. It all times be alike ſimply, and all making difference be there reproved, then could there be no time ſet apart to be obſerved by men, to the marring of that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency; and if ſo, then hath the Chriſtian Church been ſtill in a palpable groſs ſin; for if the keeping of a day by vertue of Gods Command, marr that indifferency, much more will the keeping of a day by mans command, and ſo there could never be a Sabbath. 3. We muſt therefore underſtand theſe places not as caſting all days and times ſimply, but ceremonial and Jewiſh days, or dayes invented by men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſcope of the places runneth that way, <hi>viz.</hi> againſt the bringing in of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial worſhip as neceſſary, which while ſome weak ones, not yet ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, did ſtill practiſe, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. the Apoſtle would not have them haſtily condemned in days, more then Meats; yet is there ſtill a difference betwixt Bread and Wine in the Sacrament of the Supper and other meats, which this diſcourſe of the Apoſtle taketh not away; ſo is it in dayes. And in theſe Epiſtles to the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> he ſpeaketh of dayes, and not (as would ſeem of the weekly Sabbath, which is ordinarily called a day) as taking in all the extraordinary Feaſts of the Jews, which is the more probable, becauſe the ceremonial Law was preſſed on them as ſtill neceſſary, by falſe Teachers: or he ſpeaketh of mere Jewiſh dayes, and ſo of the ſeventh day which they kept; for it is of ſuch obſervation of dayes as was ſinful, and brake them off from Grace and the Goſpel, as other ceremonies did; that he ſpeaketh of: but that cannot be ſaid of all dayes, or of keeping one day of ſeven: Therefore this cannot be meaned there.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Obj.</hi> The fourth Command preciſely commandeth the ſeventh day from the Creation to be kept; but that is not moral; therefore, neither is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection goeth upon that miſtake, as if the very ſeventh-day were ſtill commanded in it. as the main ſubſtance of it, which our next diſcourſe on the true ſcope and meaning of the Command will clear; ſo that if a ſeventh-day, and not that ſeventh-day be commanded as the main ſubſtance of that Command, that Objection falleth. 2. There is a difference to be put betwixt the mandatory part of the Command, and what is further added for preſſing the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, or for explaining its meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The precept ſtrictly is, <hi>Remember the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:31633:82"/>
Sabbath day to keep it holy:</hi> It ſaith, Remember the Sabbath, or the Holy re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what-ever day it ſhall be on; and ſo it is ſaid in the cloſe, that, <hi>He reſted the ſeventh day,</hi> but that, <hi>He bleſſed the Sabbath:</hi> Drawing it ſtill from the ſeventh preciſely, to the Sabbath: Even as in the ſecond Command: This is, 1. commanded in ſpecial, that no Image be made, then. 2. This in general, that all Gods Commandment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his worſhip, even ſuch as were Ceremonial, for the time, should be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with whatever others should be given: So here this fourth commandeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly one of the ſeven; becauſe the Recurrency of that time is bounded: and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, whatever ſeventh the Lord shall be pleaſed to pitch on.</p>
               <p>We have ſaid the more on this, becauſe it doth not only clear the true ſcope of the Command, but sheweth the neceſſity of the obſervation of that time, which the Lord hath ſanctified for himſelf. 3. We should put a difference alſo betwixt <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial</hi> and <hi>Mutable:</hi> All the Judicial Laws are Mutable; and the Decalogue it ſelf, in reſpect of its Curſe; and as it was a Covenant giving life, is actually changed and abolished: Yet is not for that to be reputed Ceremonial, and not Obligatory: (Though all Ceremonials be mutable, yet all mutables are not Ceremonial.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this change is not in the matter. Why may not therefore, the ſeventh day in order, (which was obſerved from the Creation, to the Reſurrection of Chriſt,) be changed to the firſt day of the week, which is a ſeventh day in number ſtill, without abolishing the morality of the fourth Command?</p>
               <p>Amongſt other things in this Command, there is more expreſs mention, of the whole Families joyning in this duty, then is in other Commands: Therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a concerning-duty to us; and a ſpecial thing included in the Command; we shall ſpeak to that Point concerning Family worship, (before we ſpeak of the ſecond gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral propoſed about the particular morality of this Command, and the meaning of the words of it,) that ye may ſee, that it is no invention of Men; when ye are called to it, and when it is preſſed upon you.</p>
               <p>We shall here, 1. shew you, that, This Command holdeth forth a Family, or Domeſtick Worship. 2. We shall confirm it more largely from other Scriptures, and grounds of Reaſon. 3. We shall shew, wherein it conſiſteth in particular, and on whom it mainly lyeth to be diſcharged. 4. We shall shew the advantages, of conſcientious diſcharging of it, and the Prejudices of neglecting it, with the Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of that ſin.</p>
               <p>That there is ſuch a thing as Family-worship, included in this Command, will be clear, by conſidering, 1. What worship to God in general is. 2. What Family-worship is. 3. What this Command requireth</p>
               <p n="1">1. By worship, is underſtood ſome Tribute payed, by the reaſonable Creature to God, as the great and ſoveraign Lord Creator; whether it be immediatly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly payed, and performed to him, as prayer and praiſe; or for him and at his Command, and for his honour, as preaching, hearing, and receiving of Sacraments; which are worship, when rightly gone about. In a word, we call that worship, more ſtrictly and properly, which is a duty of the firſt Table; and cometh in as comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it, for the honour of God, and not for our own, or others external profit; which, though commanded in the ſecond Table, cannot be ſo properly called wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, much leſs Immediate - worship. Thus, Teaching others the Duties of Piety, may be worship, when teaching the Duties of any other ordinary calling, is not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We call that Family-worship, which is to be performed, by ſuch and ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; or by all the conſtituent members of the Family jointly: And ſo it differeth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:31633:82"/>
1. From ſecret or ſolitary Worship, which one performeth alone to, and before God. 2. From publick Worship, which one performeth by joyning in a Congregation of many Families together. 3. From that worship performed occaſionally, in mutual fellowship amongſt Believers, or profeſſors of divers Families: For 1. That may not be ordinary as this, nor ſo frequent. 2. That is free to this or that Believer, as they shall chooſe; or as occaſions do caſt them to be together. This is not at choice, but is neceſſary, as to the ſame perſons. 3. This is performed by vertue of domeſtick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and not of Chriſtian only. 4. This may have, and should have an Authority-Domeſtick in its regulation; For a Maſter of a family, may authoritatively command the members of the family, to pray, keep the Sabbath, &amp;c. and may ſuitably correct for the neglect of thoſe duties; whereas that other is by Chriſtian Communion, and Admonition onely.</p>
               <p>Ye will ſee this Family-worship clear: 1. By conſidering the <hi>Jews</hi> eating of the Paſs-over: Where there was, 1. Secret worship, no queſtion apart. 2. There was publick-worship; a holy convocation the firſt day, and the laſt: But 3. There was peculiarly a Family-worship; or, if the family was little, two joyned together, for eating the paſs-over within the Houſe, wherein all the members of that family; or of thoſe two little families that were circumciſed were neceſſarily to be preſent, and to be joyners: this is Family-worship.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By conſidering, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 101. compared with other Scriptures, where ye have 1. <hi>David</hi> mentioning his private carriage, and longing for God, and walking in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect way. 2. His publick carriage as a Magiſtrate in cutting off the wicked from the City of God, as ye have. 3. Elſewhere his publick-worship, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 122. 1. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 4. His fellowship with all the Godly, being a Companion to them that feared God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. verſe 63. Yet fifthly, and laſtly: Ye have a walk within his Houſe with a perfect heart, mentioned there as contradiſtinct from all; which muſt infer ſome religious performances of duties, or exerciſe of worship in his Houſe in reference to that ſtation, as well as in private or in publick, yea, a joynt-exerciſe, becauſe it is ſuch an exerciſe as he performed onely at home in his Houſe; whereas had it been praying for them, or any thing, that otherwiſe he might have done apart: he needed not go home to them, for performing of it: Yet, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. verſe 20. when the publick worship is done, he goeth home to bleſs his Houſe; which manifeſtly sheweth a peculiar duty performed by him, in his Family, according as he reſolved in that 101. <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It will yet further appear, that there is ſuch a thing, and ſome way, what it is; by conſidering <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. from verſe 10. to the laſt: where there is, firſt, A publick mourning of the whole Land. 2. Of ſeveral families together: Families shall mourn then. 3. Families apart. 4. Their Wifes apart, and ſo every particular Perſon in ſecret. In which place, it is clear, 1. That there is a worship of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, beſides publick and ſecret worship. 2. That, that worship includeth the ſame duties, jointly performed by the members of the family, which Perſons in ſecret perform<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo Family-worship, will be a worshipping of God, (beſide what is in publick and ſecret,) in a Domeſtick and family-relation, jointly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That this Command requireth ſuch a family-worship diſtinct from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick and ſecret, and ſomething to be performed in worshipping of God amongſt perſons of related, which is not required of others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may thus be made out.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The thing called for in this Command is certainly worship, yea immediate wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; it being a Command of the firſt Table, and ſuch a thing as the ſanctifying of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:31633:83"/>
2. This Command taketh in all Domeſtick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Relations, Parents, Children, Son<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and Daughters, Maſters, and Servants, Men or VVomen, yea and Strangers that may be for the time, or on that day, ſojourning there; theſe are all conſtituent Members of a Family.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The thing required of them is not ſimply reſt from labour, for 1. That is commanded for the Beaſts (leſt men ſhould be hindered from or interrupted in their holy reſt by their waiting on them) and none will ſay, we hope, that there is no more required as to Children or Servants, then as to the Beaſts. 2. Under the Negative, Thou ſhalt do no work, is included the Affirmative, Thou ſhalt ſanctifie that day to the Lord. 3. The ſame Duty is required of all alike (in ſome reſpect) thou Father, and thou Son, thou Maſter, and thou Servant, and if wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip be called for from the Father, and Maſter, for the ſanctifying of that day, ſo it muſt be alſo from the Child and Servant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The manner of performing this Worſhip of ſanctifying the Lords day in Holy duties, is required not only to be in publick, nor only in ſecret, but by the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of each Family joyntly, and apart from other Families.</p>
               <p>For 1. It cannot be underſtood to require worſhip only in publick together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe 1. there may be in ſome caſes no acceſs to publick worſhip, and yet the Command of ſanctifying the Lords day lyeth ſtill on, and no doubt by Families. 2. Waiting on publick worſhip is but one piece of ſanctifying the Lords day, and that but in apart of it; therefore there muſt be ſome other thing included here. 2. It cannot be underſtood of the Maſter of the Family, his putting the Members of the Family ſeparatly to ſeek and worſhip God, and of his own going about Holy duties himſelf apart.</p>
               <p>For 1. Though that be worſhip, yet is it not worſhip from perſons in ſuch a Relation or Family<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>worſhip, more then if they were not in ſuch a Relation, or of ſuch a Family; and though it might be ſaid that ſuch and ſuch perſons ſanctified the Sebbath, yet could it not be ſaid that the Family as ſuch did it; even as Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies or perſons ſeeking God in ſecret, could not be exonered thereby, as to their being in the Congregation; nor their ſerving of God be ſo accepted as Congre; gational ſervice. if they met not together when they might: Juſt ſo it is here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>yea as it lyeth, by this Command, on a Congregation and a Miniſter to ſanctifie the Lords day, and to come together for that end; ſo doth it lye on the Family and Maſter of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By this Command there is more required then ſecret or ſolitary ſanctifying of the Sabbath, even a peculiar ſanctification of it within one Family diſtinct from another: I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. more then ſolitary worſhip, becauſe the Lords ſaying <hi>thou,</hi> without repeating Son, Daughter, &amp;c. had been ſufficient to have laid it on all ſeparately for themſelves; the enumeration therefore of the whole Members of a Family muſt import ſome other thing, for the former is implyed in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> that is, as far as in thee lyeth, thou nor thy Son, &amp;c. There muſt I ſay, be ſomething more underſtood by the peculiar enumeration pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed in this fourth Command. I ſay, 2. Even a peculiar worſhip, becauſe it's ſomething laid on by this Command which is holden <hi>within Gates</hi> or doors, and neither goeth to the Congregation, nor to the perſons of other Families, at leaſt ordinarily, but reacheth the Members of ſuch a Family who are within ſuch a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:31633:83"/>
Mans Gates or Doors; therefore it muſt be a diſtinct Family-worſhip mainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by that Family together.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The thing required here is not only worſhip ſimply, but worſhip as from a member of ſuch a Family; therefore it is not ſolitary worſhip: for ſeeking of God and moral duties in ſecret ſtill agree to perſons in all places and Families alike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this draweth a line as it were betwixt Families, and ſo divides one Family from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; yet maketh the duty more obliging to theſe within ſuch a Mans Gates or Doors, then others without Doors; therefore it muſt be joynt-worſhip: for apart, or as concerning ſecret worſhip, all are every where alike obliged.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If by this Command ſomething more in the worſhip of this day be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a perſon that is a member of a Family, in reference to that Family, then there is required of one who is not a member of ſuch a Family, or is required of that perſon in reference to another Family whereof he is not a member; then it requireth a diſtinct Family-worſhip, for no other thing can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but a joynt going about the ſanctifying of that day in a ſtricter and nearer way of Communion amongſt the members of that Family, then with perſons and Families in and to whom they are not ſo intereſted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If ſecret and publick worſhip were onely required in this Command, then ſhould we equally and alike ſanctifie the Lords day with other Families and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, not of that Family whereof we are members; for in theſe we joyn alike for them and with them, but there is ſome peculiar thing required here, which will not agree to be performed by all alike; therefore it is Family-worſhip that muſt be here required.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This Command requireth of Maſters, (ſuppoſe them to be Miniſters, or Magiſtrates) another way of ſanctifying the Sabbath, and worſhipping of God, in and with their Families, then it doth in reference to other Families; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand being ſo particular to him, and to all that are within his Gates or Doors, and members of his Family, ſpeaketh this clearly. But except it be joynt going about of duties with them, there can be no other thing underſtood to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for, 1. One may exhort another. 2. All come in publick together. 3. By the Maſters example after the publick, they all withdraw (or ſhould at leaſt) to ſecret exerciſes. 4. Magiſtrates and Miniſters may Command other Families to ſanctifie that day; What is peculiar then, as to their own Families, but to joyn with them in duties of worſhip?</p>
               <p n="7">7. If there were not Domeſtick-worſhip required on this day, then except it were in publick, Members of a Family could not converſe together; for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not converſe together in doing their own works, or in ſpeaking their own words, their fellowſhip therefore muſt be in exerciſes of worſhip, and ſo that muſt needs be required in this Command.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Some other thing is required by this Command, of a member of a Family which ſeeketh God, then of a perſon in an heatheniſh Family; or ſome other thing is required from ſo many perſons joyned together as members in one Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then from ſuch perſons ſuppoſe them to be ſcattered from one another, amongſt heatheniſh Families; certainly where Husband, Wife, Children, and Servants are Chriſtians, and Profeſſors of the ſame true Religion, there is ſome other
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:31633:84"/>
thing required of them then where onely the Husband, the Wife, the Child or the Servant is ſo; but if they were ſcattered and became parts or members of diverſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies among Heathens, they would be obliged to ſeek God apart; therefore no leſs, but much more is joint-ſeeking of God required of them, when they are united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as members of one family.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This Command (when it mentioneth <hi>all within his Gates</hi> or Doors) requireth ſome other thing of a Maſter when at home with his family, then when he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from them: But a Maſter at a diſtance may command all in his family to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God, and pray to God for them, and ſo may they all if they were ſcattered, worship God ſecretly; therefore when they are together, there is ſome other thing required of them by this Command, which is, no doubt, To worship God together.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The duties that are to be performed on this day will require this; ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing one another, exhorting, admonishing, comforting, ſtrengthening one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and talking to, or conferring with one another, of the Word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. verſe 7. 8. Which cannot be denied to be duties called for on this day; and yet they cannot be done but by joint concurring together in that work, and therefore it concludeth ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that family-worship, at leaſt on the Lords-day, is commanded here; and if families be called to worship God jointly on the Lords-day by the worship competent for that day, then by proportion are they alſo called to worship him jointly on other dayes by the worship ſuitable to them, there being the like ground for all.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And laſtly, that which is required of families, is ſuch a worship as ought to be performed by them, ſuppoſing there were no publick worship, nor yet any other family, worshipping him in the World.

               <p n="3">3. Ye will ſee it thus practiſed and preſſed before the Flood; God was honoured and worshipped in families after it (before the Law) by <hi>Abraham, Iob,</hi> and others in their Families; under it, there was the Obſervation of it, and that by peculiar Ordinances, as namely, by the Paſsover yea, it is mentioned, and that moſt expreſly in the very Law, as is ſaid; it was kept up under the Captivity, and after the return renewed by <hi>Zachariah</hi> eſpecially; yea, it is alſo renewed in the New Teſtament, whereby it appeareth to be of very ſpecial Obſervation; from all which it is not a little commended to us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we conſider the many wayes whereby the Scriptures preſs this duty, it will be found that there is hardly any duty more cleared and preſſed then it. Its preſſed: 1. By Command? 2. By examples of Godly-men held forth as Paterns for imitation. 3. By promiſes made to it, and 4. By bleſſings conferred on the conſcientious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of it, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 18. <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. verſe 18. 19. 20. 21. 5.

               <p>Hence the Argument runneth ſtrong, That duty which in Scripturs is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by many examples commended, and by other motives preſſed, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect whereof bringeth guilt and offence upon the perſons neglecting; is no doubt a neceſſary duty, but Family-worship is ſuch: therefore it is a neceſſary duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That it is commanded, what we have ſaid from this fourth Command may ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently make it out, yet we further add, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 7. 8. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 18. 19. In which two places it is clear that obſerving of the Law, is not onely to be ſtudied by a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a Family himſelf alone, but that the Religious duties of frequent ſpeaking of it, diligent teaching of it, whetting and preſſing of it on his Family, are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him; yea, it is to be written on the poſts of his Door, to shew that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion muſt be in the Family, and in all that enter into it, even as car ying the word on the fronlets betwixt their eyes, was to mind them of the peculiar and particular ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification that was called for from them.</p>

Wherein he goeth to concur with them; Intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a Holy Solemnity ſhould be partly ſpent in publick, and partly in Family<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duties, without neglect of ſecret duties: beſide that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. it is clear; and appeareth to have been alſo practiſed by all that built houſes, who did Dedicate them, and that not without Prayer, as is manifeſt by <hi>Davids</hi> Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30 as is ſaid, <hi>Job's</hi> example likewiſe maketh it out <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. where there are 1 Sacrifices in his Family, as well as for his Family. 2.

               <p n="3">3. I ſay the neglect of it is ſadly threatned as <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> ult. <hi>Pour out thy fury on the Heathen that know thee not, and on the Families which call not on thy name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> If not worſhipping of God in Families, be a Character of a Family appointed to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and be threatned with a Curſe, then prayer-worſhip in Families is a neceſſary duty; for it's clear from that place, 1. That by calling on Gods Name, is meant Gods worſhip in general; and prayer in particular, which is a ſpecial part of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. That by Families are meant particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Societies and Companies whether leſſer or greater that want this worſhip, and ſo are the Objects of that Curſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be ſaid, that by Families there, are meant People and Nations, yea (comparing this place with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79. <hi>v.</hi> 6,) Heathens that called not on God. <hi>Anſ</hi> 1. That doth confirm the Argument: for if Heathens, whether Kingdoms or Families be deſcribed by this, that they call not on God; then ſtill it muſt be a Heatheniſh Kingdom that has not publick worſhip, a Heatheniſh perſon who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſecret worſhip, and ſo a Heatheniſh Family that wanteth Family-worſhip. 2. The Curſe here is not threatned to Families as Families, but as ſuch Families that call not on Gods Name, therefore it reacheth them: for, <hi>à quatenus ad omne,</hi> &amp;c. So then what ever profeſſion Families have otherwayes, if they want this duty they are thereby laid open to the Curſe. 3. It is all one upon the matter whether by Families be meant Societies leſſer or greater: for if it be a fault in Nations to neglect Gods worſhip, and if the neglect thereof bring a Curſe on them, will it not be a fault in particular Families, and bring a Curſe on them? 4. Families cannot be excluded, ſeeing they are expreſly named; though more be included, to wit, that the Curſe cometh on multitudes of Families, or upon Nations made up of Families. And we conceive Families to be particularly named, 1. To ſhew that the Curſe will reach all Societies leſſer as well as greater, who have this Character. 2. Becauſe Nations are made up of Families, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſibneſs (to ſay ſo) betwixt the carriage of families in religious worſhip, and the carriage of the whole Land. 5. The comparing of <hi>Jeremy</hi> 10 with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79 will not enervate any of the places; but, when put together, they ſhew that the Holy Ghoſt doth mean both Families and Kingdomes, and that what is implyed in the one place is expreſſed in the other, to ſhew that God will have both publick-worſhip from whole Kingdoms and Family-worſhip from particular Families as parts of theſe Kingdoms. 6. The ground whence the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rſe is derived, is becauſe that ſuch a Society neglecteth ſuch a duty, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:31633:85"/>
therefore how-ever we expond the place and the word <hi>Family</hi> there, it will hold of all Societies in general.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I ſaid that the having of Family-worſhip is looked upon as a ſpecial qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, and the want of it as a ſcandal and offence, for. 1. Who are to be admitted Elders or Deacons? Is it not ſuch who have this qualification of <hi>Ruling their own Houſes well?</hi> 1, Tim. 3. v. 4. Tit. 1. 6. (yea even Widows, 1 Tim. 5. 10. are to be tryed by this, that <hi>they have brought up Children,</hi> no doubt Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Religiouſly, which can very hardly, if at all be, without worſhipping of God with them) 2. If that qualification, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ruling their own Houſe well, be found to be wanting, they are accounted to be unmeet to rule in Gods Houſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
               <p>Whence we may reaſon thus: That which caſteth a man as unmeet for bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule in Chriſts Houſe, how-ever otherwiſe he be qualified, is an offence and a ſcandal; but the want of Family-worſhip doth that; therefore the want of it is a ſcandal.</p>
               <p>In theſe places it is clear, 1. That Ruling of their own Houſe is meant not only in outward and temporal things, but alſo, if not mainly, in what concerneth the honour, ſervice and worſhip of God; for 1. it's the Ruling of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Children together, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>verſe</hi> 4. 5. Now it is clear that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are to be brought up in the fear of the Lord, 2. It's a Ruling that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth them as gracious, which no Ruling in temporal things will do; ſeeing many meere natural men, are wiſer in their own Generation that way, then the Children of light. 3. Many much leſs fit for Ruling in theſe things, may yet be fit to Rule in Gods Houſe, as experience cleareth. 4. Theſe words, <hi>having Children in ſubjection in all gravity,</hi> ſpeak out a Chriſtian and Religious Rule and order to be kept in the Houſe or Family in reference to a Religous end, which cannot but take in Family-worſhip; yet it is alſo clear, that he meaneth not ſimply of inability to rule, but mainly of defectiveneſs in the improving the ability which God hath given for Ruling; therefore it is not ſaid here, He that cannot Rule his Houſe (though that be in part truth) but he that doth not Rule; and it is tanked with exceſſive drinking, ſtriking, pride, and other groſſe ills; it having that ſame effect that they had, to wit, to declare incapacity for ſuch Offices; Hence this is not to be the Rule of tryal, if he can Rule his own houſe well, as having gifts fitting him for it, but (ſuppoſing him to have theſe) it's to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired if he doth actually Rule it well, which is the evidence of the right im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of his gifts; therefore here Ruling in the mans own houſe, and ruling in the Church or Houſe of God, are looked on as two degrees of one thing of the ſame nature, becauſe both taken in, not only gifts fitting for the diſcharge of the duty of this reſpective ruling it, but conſcience and faithfulneſs in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We ſhall not here to this purpoſe inſiſt on the frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is made in the Scripture of Churches being in Families; But ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to add to what we have ſaid, Six or Seven Reaſons or grounds that will further prove and clear the thing.</p>
               <p>The firſt is drawn from nature, which teacheth not only that the true God ſhould be alone ſerved and worſhipped, but that according to the Stations God hath put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in, they ſhould improve them with their gifts &amp; parts for a higher end
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:31633:86"/>
then their own behooff or advantage; to wit, his glory: And that as they have a peculiar fellowship given them by him as his gift, ſo he should have anſwerable and peculiar acknowledgement from them; and therefore ſeeing the appointment of Families is Gods Ordinance, and that its he that giveth to ſome Children and Servants which are with-held from others, there ought in all reaſon a Tribute to be given to him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from that Society and the Family: hence it was that before the Law the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs had their worship ſpecially in their Families; yea Heathens, beſide their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick idolatrous worship, and idolatrous Temples, had their peculiar <hi>Penates</hi> or <hi>Houshold-Gods,</hi> on whom for their particular families, delivery from enemies and protection, they depended.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond is drawn from the nature of Chriſtian Communion amongſt Believers, which as it requireth the performing of Chriſtian duties, according as we are in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence called to them, ſo it requireth the making uſe of that tye of Family-intereſt or relation ſuper-added to the former for furtherance and entertaining of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, becauſe there is a ſpecial acceſs miniſtred by ſuch a relation to the attaining of that end; Hence it is we conceive (as is ſaid) that ſome Chriſtian Families are called Churches, becauſe ſo many Chriſtians caſten together, lived in a Chriſtian diſcharge of all Family-Ordinances (ſo to ſpeak.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord by his Covenant doth eſpecially (though not alway) derive mercies to Families taking them in together, and making promiſes to them, and conferring priviledges on them. So <hi>Abrahams</hi> whole Family was taken in Covenant, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17. And in the New Teſtament whole Families were at once Baptized, which certainly calleth them to a peculiar way of being anſwerable to ſuch priviledges and ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And is not this one ſpecial and very proper way of being anſwerable to them, that they worship God together, and joyn in bleſſing him for ſuch mercies, and in prayer to him for grace to carry ſuitably to them?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The mutual intereſt that uſually is in the condition of members of the ſame Family, calleth for joynt-ſeeking of God, and worshipping of him, as they are joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned in the ſame dangers, the ſame ſins often, the ſame ſtroaks, the ſame du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the ſame mercies; for what is ſo to one, is ordinarily ſome way ſo to all, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought they to joyn in confeſſing of ſins, acknowledging mercies, deprecating dangers and ſtroaks, and diſcharging of duties.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Private</hi> worship is profitable to all the ends of a family. Its an acknowledging of God and honouring of him, it helpeth the Maſter to keep his authority, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth every one in their Family to walk the more reſpectively towards the reſt, and it keepeth from many out-breakings, when they are to meet ſo often together to ſeek and worship God; hence, in experience, we often ſee that theſe families, where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worship is, are generally more civil, at leaſt, then other families, where it is not, and that the children and ſervants of ſuch families readily profit moſt, are moſt countenanced by Gods bleſſing, and are in greateſt capacity to get good of the publick Ordinances.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Lord loveth to have a diſtinction betwixt theſe that ſerve him, and theſe that ſerve him not; Now as to a family relation, what difference is there betwixt a profeſſing Chriſtian family, where the joynt worship of God is not, and a heathenish family? Heathens live, and eat, and work together, and when no more is ſeen, they look very like the one to the other. Even as in a Nation where no publick worship is, though private Perſons privately ſeek God, yet there ſeemeth to be no publick national difference betwixt that Nation and a heathen Nation: ſo in the former caſe a family difference will hardly be found, if any should inquire of what ſort of families theſe are.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:31633:86"/>
Add that it will be hard to ſay that a man should take care of the outward Eſtate of his Family, and neglect the ſpiritual, and keep Communion with his Family in temporal things, and none in ſpiritual duties; yea, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he should be much more in theſe, as being both more neceſſary and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>
               <p>Having firſt shewed that this fourth Command holdeth forth a family worship, and having ſecondly confirmed it more largely from other Scriptures and grounds of reaſon, it followeth now according to the method propoſed, that we shew in the third place, how particularly the Scripture deſcribeth wherein it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, whereby it will further appear to be of God. The Scripture deſcribeth it four wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In general it is called in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Joshuas</hi> Caſe, <hi>keeping the way of Lord, ſerving the Lord,</hi> very comprehenſive expreſſions, taking in much, and here its <hi>ſanctifying of the Sabbath;</hi> that is, performing of the duties which are to be diſcharged for the right ſanctifying of that day; we conceive it to be in short, to do theſe things in a joynt family-way, which a Servant of God may, and ought to do, alone; that is, to pray, read, ſing Pſalms, &amp;c. or to do in a Domeſtick way, what Chriſtians in providence caſt together may do, as to pray, read, further one anothers edification by repeating of Sermons, ſpiritual conference, inſtruction, exhortation, admonition, &amp;c. for they have their tye of Chriſtianity, and this of a Family-relation beſide, which doth not abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the former, nor derogate from it, but doth further corroborate and add more ſtrength to it, as to make it more neceſſary and leſs elective, more frequent and leſs occaſional, and to be now by Domeſtick rules authoritatively regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar for edification, which cannot ſo be by the ſimple tye of Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſpeaketh of particular duties, wherein they should joyn, as firſt, Here of ſanctifying the Sabbath in all the duties of it, adding more to our Family-worship that day then other dayes, as well as to our ſecret wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for the Sabbath was to have its double offering. Secondly, Of praying, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> which is neceſſarily included in that mourning, mentioned, Zech. 12. <hi>A fruit of the poured out Spirit of Grace and Supplications,</hi> So 2 Sam. 6. <hi>Davids</hi> bleſſing his family is to be unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſtood of his going before them in prayer to God for a bleſſing on them, not in common as a publick Prophet, which he did with the People, but as a peculiar duty diſcharged by him to his family, whereof he was head. Thirdly, Of family faſting, or ſetting of time apart in the family extraordinarily for Faſting and Prayer, as in <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. in that ſolemn mourning, and in <hi>Eſther</hi> 4. where it is recorded, that she and her maids (who were her family) and all the Jews at <hi>Shuſan</hi> (who yet could not have in that place a publick faſt) did go about that duty. Fourthly, Of Inſtruction, a moſt neceſſary duty to inſtruct and teach the family the knowledge of God; the Command goeth expreſly on this, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 6. 7, 8. and 11. 19, 20. where we commanded to talk of the Law within the Houſe, to teach it our Children di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, or (as the word is) to whet it on them by catechizing, and to write it on the poſts of our Doors, and on the walls of the Houſe, for what end I pray? Sure for this very end, that the Houſe might have the means of knowledge in it, and that the knowledge of Gods Law might be taught and learned in it, and will any think that the Walls should teach and the Maſter be ſilent?
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:31633:87"/>
Eſpecially, ſeeing it is for the Families behoof, that theſe things were written? What if ſome in the Family could not read? which on ſeveral accounts might be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it would follow that they were loſt, if there were no more nor other teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then what was by writing on the walls; when <hi>Abraham</hi> commanded his houſe to keep the way of the Lord, and to ſerve him, will any think he did not teach them, who he was, and how he ſhould be ſerved? By proportion other things fit for edification, and as worſhip to God, come in here, particularly praiſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scripture ſpeaketh of, and holdeth out the duty of the particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Family, and that in reference to the ſtations they are in, and the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they ſuſtain and ſtand under, as of Husband and Wife, that they live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Heirs of the grace of life, and ſo as their prayers may not be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of parents, that they do not onely provide for their Children tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, but that they alſo being them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. and 12. both Children and Servants are put in together.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Scripture ſpeaketh of ordering of Families by a ſpecial Family diſcipline and Authority, therefore it is called in <hi>Abraham, commanding or charging his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to keep the way of the Lord,</hi> and 1 Tim. 3. <hi>a ruling of their own houſe well,</hi> with ſome reſemblance unto ruling in the Church by Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, with which it is ſome way compared, as having a fitneſs, or as being an evidence of fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for that.</p>
               <p>This Diſcipline conſiſteth eſpecially in theſe three, 1. in making good dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Laws for Children and Servants in ordering every thing aright, that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the promoting of godlineſs and edification amongſt them, and in timing of things rightly, ſo as every duty that is to be done in the family, may be done in the beautiful ſeaſon of it. 2. In putting forth a paternal or parental and maſterly authority in carrying on theſe ends, commanding or charging as <hi>Abraham</hi> did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ruling ſo as Children and Servants may be kept in ſubjection; it is very inſuitable and no wayes allowable, that Maſters ſhould command in their own buſineſs, and onely intreat in the things of God. 3. In exacting an account of obedience and cenſuring diſobedience; <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David</hi> do reprove their own Wives by vertue of the authority of their headſhip, <hi>David</hi> will not ſuffer a wicked perſon to abide in his houſe; that is, when commands and rebukes will not do, he will even extrude and put away.</p>
               <p>If it be asked here, on whom doth the burden of diſcharging duties in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily eſpecially lye, and what is to be thought of <hi>Chaplains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will not altogether condemn <hi>Chaplains,</hi> for certainly, Maſters may make uſe of helps, and God as often bleſſed it, and that practiſe of <hi>Levites</hi> being in Families, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. <hi>verſe</hi> 13. 18, 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (though it was a ſnare through his own fault to that Levite, who went ſeeking a place to ſojourn in <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. in <hi>Micahs</hi> houſe) ſeemeth to inſinuate that there hath been, and might have been, ſomewhat of this, and good if well improved; yet when putting the charge upon Chaplains, either meerly for Maſters of Families their own eaſe, and when they think themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together exoned of that burden, becauſe they have ſuch with them, or when
<pb facs="tcp:31633:87"/>
it's becauſe they think leſs of, and undervalue that duty themſelves, or account it below them to catechize and inſtruct ſervants, or to pray in their Families, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot beſtow ſo much time on theſe duties, who yet can beſtow much more idly, that is utterly culpable and inexcuſable; the burden lyeth on the Maſter primarily and chiefly, and therefore he can never denude himſelf wholly of it, more then of his other neceſſary affairs, except when more publick affairs call him, or when infirmities impede him; for here the Command ſaith, thou, to wit, <hi>Maſter, nor thy Son, nor Servant,</hi> &amp;c. it ſpeaketh directly and immediately to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the performance of the duty is eſpecially called for from him; ſo in that example of <hi>Abraham</hi> it's he that commandeth his houſhold to keep the way of the Lord, <hi>Job</hi> himſelf offereth the ſacrifice, <hi>David</hi> will not ſend home, but goeth himſelf to bleſs his houſe (though they had other wayes much employment if that could excuſe) and the man that is to be choſen an elder, is ſuch as ruleth his own houſe well; having of a Chaplain, will give no great proof of the Maſters own dexterity, yet we ſay, that one may for the better effectuating the end take help, though he cannot altogether devolve the burden on another; yea, we think when the Maſter is negligent or abſent, Duty falleth to be performed by theſe of the Family, on whom the weight of his affairs doth in his failing or falling ſhort, lye, if qualified; ſo that amongſt other defects they ſhould make up this, or in ſuch a Caſe the moſt fit and beſt qualified in the family ought to be pitched on for this.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid Family-worſhip appeareth to be ſo convincingly clear, neceſſary and important a duty, that any Objections or Scruples, that can be moved againſt it, moſt needs be but of little weight and importance, and may be eaſily ſolved and ſatisfied: It will not therefore be needful to condeſcend particularly on them: And as for the advantages that wait on the conſcientious and ſuitable practiſe of this duty they are many, a few whereof we ſhall very briefly touch upon: As 1. It hath Gods ſpecial approbation, teſtimony, and commendation, and he hath a great delight and complacency in the diligent and faithful Practiſers of it, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 18. <hi>verſe</hi> 19. 2. It advanceth to a high degree of familiarity with God, and is attended with ſweet Communications of his mind as himſelf thinketh fit, <hi>ibid.</hi> comparing verſe 19 with verſe 17. and 18. 3. It is readily and often followed with ſucceſs more or leſs towards the ſpiritual good, and edification of Servants and Children, either in the Maſters life time, or when he is gone, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. v. 19. Abraham <hi>will command his children and houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, they ſhall keep</hi> is emphatick and obſervable; and with promiſed bleſſings on the Maſter, or head of the Family, <hi>ibid. That the Lord may bring upon</hi> Abraham, <hi>that which he bath ſpoken of him.</hi> 4. It is a notable mean of the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and encreaſe of the knowledge of God: O what plenty of the growth of the knowledge of God might, and would be, in the Church, if all Maſters of Families made Conſcience of Family-duties? and particularly of catechiſing and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the knowledge of the principles of Religion! And what can one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter do as to this alone in a numerous Congregation, if all, or moſt, Maſters of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies be negligent, who yet muſt anſwer to God for the Souls of their Children and Servants, as well as the Miniſter muſt for the Souls of all under his Charge; theſe being under their Charge, as well as the other are under his, as is clear, from
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:31633:88"/>
this ſame Command. 5. It very much furthers through Gods bleſſing all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily for profiting by the Miniſtry of the Word, and for joyning in publick duties of Worship, as is obvious. 6. It procureth, or at leaſt, is a fit, hopeful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing mean for procuring a ſuitable diſcharge of all ſorts of Duties, called for from the ſeveral Members of the family in their reſpective capacities. 7. It is nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly contributive, through Gods bleſſing, for preventing many publick ſcandals in the Church, whereby the Name of God is much dishonoured, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion thereof diſgraced. 8. The ruling of a mans own houſe well, doth not a little fit him, that is otherwiſe qualified for it, and called to it, for ruling in the houſe of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4. And by proportion for other publick Employments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof he is capable, and to which he is called. 9. It is wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſweetly, ſmiling, quieting and ſatisfying Reflexions in a ſtrait, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at death; and failings in it (let be utter neglects) are waited then with ſad and bitter challenges, as may be gathered from <hi>Davids</hi> laſt words, 2 Sam. 23. 5. <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God,</hi> &amp;c. The contrary prejudices either of the utter neglect, or of the careleſs and overly performance of theſe family-duties, may be eaſily diſcovered by the due conſideration of theſe fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and other ſuch like advantages: And from all that is ſaid on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the horrid aggravations of the grievous ſin of neglecting family worship ſo clearly commanded, ſo much commended and preſſed; ſo much practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Saints, held forth to be ſo advantagious in its practiſe, and ſo prejudicial and ſeverely threatned in its neglect, cannot be but at firſt view obvious to any that will but with ordinary ſeriouſneſs take notice of them.</p>
               <p>Having cleared that this Command is moral, not as to the ſetting a part of time for duty (which every Command ſuppoſeth) but of ſo much time, particularly ſtinted and defined in the Command: We come now to ſee what is ſpecially comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded here; the Command divideth it ſelf in a <hi>Mandat,</hi> or mandatory part in the firſt words thereof, and in an amplicatory part, wherein it is more fully cleared and preſſed: The 1. is, <hi>Remember the Sabbath-day to ſanctifie it, or keep it holy:</hi> for the opening up and winning at the clear meaning whereof, we would conſider three words.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, what it is to <hi>remember</hi> or (as it is infinitively ſet down) <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring</hi> to remember; this is prefixed and would look rather like the inferring of ſomething commanded already, then the new inſtituting of a command, and ſo indeed, it ſeemeth to ſuppoſe a day formerly inſtitute and ſet apart for God (as was hinted before) which by this Command his people are put to mind: It doth beſide import theſe four with a reſpect it were to four times. Firſt, A conſtant and continued duty at all times, and in all dayes; that is, that we would remember, that God has ſet apart a ſeventh day for himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every day we would remember to caſt our Affairs ſo, as they may not be impediments to us in the ſanctifying of that day, and we would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour alwayes to keep our hearts in ſuch a frame as we may not be diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when that day shall come, and this affirmative part of this Command bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>ſemper</hi> or alway, and its negative <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> on other dayes as well as on the Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It importeth a timely preparing for the Sabbath, when it is a coming, or when it draweth near, this <hi>remembring</hi> it calleth for ſomething to be done in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to it; before it come a man by this is obliged to endeavour to have a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:31633:88"/>
frame of heart, that he may be ready to meet the Sabbath, and enter kindly to the duties of it, when it ſhal come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or otherways, if it come on him while he is in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or courſe frame, and not fitted for it, it will ſay he has not been remembring it before it came.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Remembring</hi> importeth an intenſeneſs and ſeriouſneſs in going about the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the day, when it cometh, and that it ſhould be with all carefulneſs ſanctified, and that men ſhould be mindful of the duties called for, leſt their hearts divert from them, or ſlacken, benſil and grow formal in them; whereby mens inclination to forget this duty, or to be ſuperficial in it, is much hinted at, this word we take to be moral, being a mean for furthering the great duty aimed at of ſanctifying the Lords-day, or Sabbath coming.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Remembring</hi> may import this, that the Sabbath even when it is paſt, ſhould not be ſoon forgotten, but that we ſhould look on the Sabbath paſt to remember it, leſt by looſing the fruits of it, when it is by, we make our ſelves guilty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning it.</p>
               <p>The next word is, <hi>the day of the Sabbath.</hi> By <hi>Sabbath</hi> here is meaned reſt, as it is exponed by the <hi>Apostle, Hebr.</hi> 4. and that not every reſt, but a holy reſt from our own works, that there may be acceſs to poſitive ſanctifying of that day, for the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of that day is the end, and this is but a mean and neceſſary ſuppoſed help, without which the day cannot be ſanctifyed in holy duties; holy duties and our own works being for the time inconſiſtent; beſides, that reſt on this day is not onely called for, as ceaſing from our ordinary affairs in the time of worſhip is called for on any other day, but more eſpecially and ſolemnly in reſpect of the day it ſelf; for at other times our duties require a time for them, and therefore that time cannot be employed in another ordinary work and in worſhip alſo, but here the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth time and reſt to be ſanctified, and therefore we are to perform holy duties <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that time, becauſe it is to be ſanctified; other times and reſts are drawn after worſhip, this time and reſt draweth worſhip neceſſarily after it; hence it was that onely the Jews feaſts were called Sabbaths, I mean religious Sabbaths, not civil or politick, as their years were, becauſe they included a reſt upon deſtination to an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:31633:89"/>
The day mentioned here is the natural day, becauſe it's a ſeventh day, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to each of the ſix dayes, given unto us, and they with the ſeventh making up the Week, it muſt contain as many hours as any of the reſt doth; but <hi>the ſix dayes wherein God made Heaven and Earth,</hi> &amp;c. are natural days; therefore the ſeventh to wit, the day of reſt, muſt be ſo alſo.</p>
               <p>Let us only for further clearing and for directing our own Practiſe ſpeak here a word or two more, 1. We ſay it is a whole natural day, that is, as it's uſually employed by us on any of the ſix Dayes for our own Works, that as we ſpend ſo much time in our ordinary Callings on other dayes, ſo would we employ ſo much in Gods Worſhip ſecret, private<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and publick on that day; what proportion of time we uſe to give, or may and ſhould give ordinarily to our Callings on other dayes, we would give as much to God and his Worſhip, to our Souls, and our ſpiritual ſtate on the Lords day or Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. there is not to be underſtood here a rigid preſſing of all theſe hours to be ſpent in Duties of immediate Worſhip, but our Working and Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, having a reſpect to our infirmities, and alſo to our Duties, leſt under pretext of infirmity we incroach upon Gods day, and give him leſs then we give to our ſelves, or ſhould and may give him: And ſo in Scripture they accompted, what is betwixt riſing and going to bed, as ſtill the Work of one day, or one dayes Work; for as God in conceding ſix dayes to us, hath yet ſo done it, as there may be a Reſerve of particular times for Worſhip called for from us to him every day for keeping up our Communion with him; ſo on the ſeventh day doth the Lord allow ſo much conveniency of ſleep and other refreſhing, as may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient for the main end of the day, theſe being Works of mercy and neceſſity, which Chriſt allowed on the Sabbath, which was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet care would be had leſt under pretext of theſe we exceed, and apply too much of what is the Lords unneceſſarily for our ſelves and on our luſts; and if we will wake for ordinary buſineſs, and keep up on ſuch and ſuch a Dyet, other Dayes, yea if we might do it, or others no more ſtrong then we, do it, the pretence of infirmity will not excuſe us, eſpecially ſeeing hardly it can be often inſtanced, that timeouſneſs at Gods Work in that day, or earneſtneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in it, hath proved hurtful, which we may account as a part of Gods bleſſing on the ſeventh day, that leſs meat and ſleep may be as refreſhful as more at another time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus much for the <hi>quamdiu,</hi> or the Continuance of the day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be enquired how often by vertue of this command that day doth recur? if it be one of ſeven? or, if it be the very ſeventh? And ſo if this day be to be taken definitely for the very ſeventh day after the Creation, or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely for one day of ſeven, as the Lord ſhould otherwayes determine, or had elſewhere determined; a ſtricting then to a day: but not any particular day by vertue of this command, but to ſuch a day as was formerly deſcribed or preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed from the beginning, during the Jewiſh State, and to ſuch another day as God ſhould after Chriſts coming reveal unto them, and pitch upon for his ſervice? for taking it for granted, that a Seventh day as moral is commanded, it followeth to be inquired, whether it be the Seventh in number, that is, one of ſeven, or the ſeventh in order, that is, the Seventh day?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:31633:89"/>
For anſwering this we would permit, 1, That there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two; the one, to wit, that there be a Seventh doth concern the matter and ſubſtance of piety; the other, to wit, which of theſe Seven it be, is more circumſtantial and is alike, if it be appointed by God, and have the bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is uſual for God in his commands concerning worſhip, not at firſt to expreſs a particular definitely, but to deliver it in the boſome of a general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, mediately, and by clear conſequence, as it were ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one <hi>Genus.</hi>

               <p>As for inſtance, 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when <hi>Deut,</hi> 12. 5. he commandeth his people to offer their Sacrifices in the place which he ſhould chooſe, here there is a ſtinting or aſtricting of them to the place which God ſhould reveal unto them; this before the Temple was built, tyed them to the Ark, and ſometimes to one place, and ſometimes to another, as it was removed and placed, till it was brought to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> but after the Temple was built and choſen for the place, it aſtricted men to that; yea when the Temple is deſtroyed, and Chriſt come, it a ſtricteth men to no place by another, but it obligeth men to worſhip God every where in ſpirit and truth: It's true, this is a Ceremonial precept, and will not hold in all things, eſpecially as to its oblition, yet while it ſtood by a poſitive Authority or Precept, it ſheweth that God may command a particular, as one day of ſeven, and yet not inſtantly ſo determine, but that one and the ſame command may inforce to diverſe dayes at diverſe times, upon ſuppoſition of Gods manifeſting his mind, even as by one command men were aſtricted ſucceſſively to diverſe places</p>
               <p n="2">2. See it inſtanced in the ſecond Command, wherein God requireth ſuch a worſhip, as he himſelf ſhould preſcribe, which is the moral affirmative part of it, and diſchargeth all worſhip by Images, that is, the moral negative part thereof; by vertue whereof Believers were then tyed, to offer Sacrifices, to Circumciſe, to keep the Paſſover, &amp;c. but now Believers are tyed to Baptize, to celebrate the Lords Supper, &amp;c. yet by vertue of one and the ſame command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo here, that command which requires the Seventh day from the Jews, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Firſt day from us Chriſtians, for the Sabbath, becauſe theſe particulars are not expreſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> directly, and immediately called for by theſe commands, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly and by conſequence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet this ſecond command tyed the <hi>Jews</hi> to abſtain from blood, and to circumciſe, before the ceremonial Law was added to them, becauſe theſe commands were formerly revealed to them, but it tyed them to theſe accidentally (to ſay ſo) and by conſequence only, even ſo we ſay of the fourth command as to the Seventh day, it being inſtituted before: conſider for this <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 26. where ſix dayes for gathering of Manna, &amp; a ſeventh for reſt, are ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>A third Inſtance is in Tithes, which was the Lords requiring apart of their Means or Subſtance, as this was apart of their time; he there required the tenth part of their increaſe, as here he doth the ſeventh part of their time; yet God, in proportioning their eſtates, did not particularly limit to any exact and preciſe order, but as to this proportion of their eſtates whatever they were; ſo we ſay here, had not the day been determined other wayes then by this command, it would not have implyed any particular definite day of the Seven,</p>

                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:31633:90"/>
3. We premit, that though the ſeventh day be called moral, as is expreſſed in the Command, or underſtood, yet it is but moral poſitive, and ſo alterable at the will of the Law-giver, and therefore the queſtion would not be much different, if acknowledging the ſeventh day to be commanded to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as one of ſeven, we yet aſſerted the ſeventh to be diſcharged, and one of ſeven to be ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſo one of ſeven would be binding now, and not the ſeventh.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet leſt we ſhould ſeem to admit ſomewhat changeable in the very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it ſelf preciſely conſidered, we would put difference betwixt the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding part of the Law, and its explicatory part; the command may be moral and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite, although ſome things in reaſons and motives were not ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face which inforceth all the commands, &amp; in the promiſe annexed to the fifth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was ſomething peculiar to that people, yet cannot we caſt off all becauſe of that; ſuppoſe there had no more been in this fourth Command, but <hi>remember in the day of reſt to keep it holy,</hi> that would not have inferred the ſeventh day, though we think the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe of its former ſanctification, would have been obliged to keep that day by vertue of this Command: And ſuppoſe that in the explications or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons there may be ſomething added peculiar to that people (which cannot be a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, but at the moſt (if any thing) the ſeventh day) yet that which is in the commanding part, will ſtill ſtand moral, to wit, that the day of reſt ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred; and if it can be made out that it was determined to the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the ſeventh day (though it were in the reaſons added) and to us afterward to ſanctifie the firſt day, they will be both found to be a ſeventh day, and a day of reſt, and therefore to be remembred and to be ſanctified; this would reſolve into the ſame thing on the matter; yet we conceive it ſafeſt to aſſert that in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand God hath ſet apart a ſeventh day to himſelf, which is to be ſanctified by us, by our application of it to holy uſes, but doth not by it expreſly, directly, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily bind to the ſeventh day, but ſecondarily and by conſequence, to wit, as it was other wayes before declared by him, and ſo it bindeth now that ſame way to the ſanctifying of the firſt day of the week, as being now revealed by God, juſt as in the former inſtances or examples we touched upon.</p>
               <p>That a ſeventh day (whatever it be which is choſen of God) and not the ſeventh day in order, is to be ſanctifyed by vertue of this Command, as injoyning that, as the ſubſtance and matter of it, may be made out by theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That which is the ſubſtance of this Command is moral, and bindeth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, as we have formerly proved (for if its ſubſtance be not moral, then it ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is not ſo either) but that a ſeventh day ſhould be ſanctified hath been maintained in the Church by the Apoſtles in their retaining the firſt day of the week, while the ſeventh hath been laid by and never uſed; therefore it was not the ſeventh, but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſeventh day which was primarily commanded in this Command; ſo that no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular day is inſtituted here more then any poſitive ſervice is preſcribed in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Command: yet the obſervation of what was preſcribed, or ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed was included. Even ſo it is here in reference to that day; and as we may inferr that the ſecond Command injoyned not ſuch and ſuch Ordinances primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they are aboliſhed; and that ſuch as were negative or prohibited, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not making of Images, are moral, becauſe they are continued, and Images are to be rejected; juſt ſo may we conclude that a ſeventh day here was primarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:31633:90"/>
and is moral becauſe it is continued, and that the ſeventh was not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, becauſe it is rejected and laid aſide.</p>
               <p>This Argument eſpecially made out in the deſignation of the Lords day will prove this, for if that ſeventh day was the ſubſtance of this Command, then either it is to be continued as moral, which were againſt the current of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein, as Chriſt hath ſet forth different Ordinances, ſo a different chief ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn time for worſhip; or we muſt ſay that this fourth Command belongeth not to us at all, the contrary whereof we have made out: It muſt then follow, that it was not the ſeventh day, but a ſeventh day which this Command reſpecteth, which therefore belongeth to us, as it did to the Jews, as well as any other Command (and particularly the ſecond Command) doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If God hath put a difference ſome way betwixt the Sabbath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded here, and the day of his own reſt, the ſeventh day, then it would ſeem its not that day which it commanded: But he hath put a difference, firſt, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory part, <hi>Remember;</hi> what? not the ſeventh day, but the Sabbath day, or day of reſt: 2. In the bleſſing, it is not ſaid, he <hi>bleſſed the ſeventh day,</hi> but <hi>the Sabbath;</hi> therefore is that difference ſo palpable, as being ſpecially intended; whereas if the ſcope of the Command were only the ſeventh day, it had been much more clear to have ſet it down other wayes; and no other probable reaſon of the difference can be given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Either a ſeventh day is commanded primarily, and then the ſeventh but ſecondarily and conſequentially, or the ſeventh was commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and one of ſeven but conſequentially (for both were commanded to them) and the firſt, to wit, the ſeventh as being in uſe before. But it cannot be ſaid that the ſeventh day was primarily commanded, and one of ſeven conſequentially only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the general is firſt commanded, and then the particular; as when God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Tithes of increaſe and Cattle, by the Command of Tithes he firſt required the proportion, and then what particular proportion as to order, he himſelf ſhould carve out to them; and ſo conſequently came in the tenth Beaſt (which paſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rod) by a particular command, <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. 32, 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe there God determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but if that tenth had not been ſet down, the general command had but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined upon the tenth of Cattle, as of Sheaves, or bolls of Corn, even ſo it is as to the day, the Command requireth one of ſeven primarily: but that it is this ſeventh, followeth from another determination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If the moral grounds and reaſons which preſs this Command do moſt directly reſpect a ſeventh day, and not the ſeventh; then its not the ſeventh day, but a ſeventh day, which is primarily commanded in it (for the reaſons bear out eſpecially what is moral in it, and principally intended) but the moral reaſons preſſing it plead more ſtrongly and directly for a ſeventh day, and but indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for the ſeventh day as it was then inſtituted; <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. That the reaſons do directly preſs a ſeventh day, and in a manner ſtick cloſely to it, may thus be made out.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the reaſons equally preſs on us the firſt day, and the obſervation of it (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it now to be obſerved according to Divine warrant) then they do not primarily preſs the ſeventh, but the reaſons equally preſs on us the firſt day, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. the major is clear, for the ſame thing cannot preſs two different dayes
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:31633:91"/>
primarily nor equally; that the reaſons concern us as well as them upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition aforeſaid, may thus appear:</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are univerſal, and do not belong to that people more then any other, for the conceſſion of ſix dayes is to all, and Gods example of reſting, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the breaking of that Command be equally ſinful to us with them, and ſtrike againſt the equity of the Command, and Gods example in us as well as in them, then theſe reaſons concern us alſo, and us as well as them: Now that they do ſo, and agredge the ſin of prophaning our Lords day as they did the ſin of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning their Sabbath, we muſt either grant, or we muſt deny that they concern us at all: Beſide the weight of a challenge from the conſcience by vertue of them, will put a tender heart out of queſtion of it, ſeeing God giveth us ſix dayes to our ſelves, as he did to them, and his example propoſed to us ought to be reſpected by us, as well as by them, and the ſame general equity is in both.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the reaſons be a ſufficient ground of allowance to us for ſix working dayes together, even the laſt ſix of the week, as they were to them for the firſt ſix; then they determine not the ſeventh day to be the day of reſt primarily, but a ſeventh following theſe ſix of labour; but they do allow us warrantably to work ſix dayes, even the laſt ſix of the week; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they do not determine the ſeventh day prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; the connexion of the major ſeemeth to be very clear: For firſt, theſe muſt ſtand and fall together, if the conceſſion (to call it ſo) concern us in the ſix working dayes, ſo muſt the reſervation of a ſeventh. 2. As the conceſſion concerneth us in the ſix working dayes, ſo muſt the prohibition of work on a ſeventh of reſt, for the one determineth the other, if the conceſſion be for ſix in number, ſo muſt the prohibition be for a ſeventh in number; but if the conceſſion be of ſix in order, then it is the ſeventh that is to be reſerved, and if the ſeventh be related to in the prohibition of work, then the conceſſion muſt look to the firſt ſix dayes, which it doth not, as we have ſhewed. And therefore 3. ſeeing the ſix dayes conceſſion looketh to ſix in number, ſo many thou mayeſt or ſhalt work together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no more, the prohibition muſt alſo reſpect the number, to wit, a ſeventh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not the ſeventh day: the minor will be clear to the judicious conſiderer, by a particular application of the reaſons of the fourth Command.</p>
               <p>Further, if the conceſſion reſpect not the number, but the order (as it muſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the prohibition of work on the ſeventh reſpect the order and not the number) then 1. what warrant have we for our ſix work dayes? if it be not here, where is it? for ſure we cannot take Gods time without his order and warrant: 2. and more eſpecially, then could not we by vertue of this Command plead allowance for working ſix dayes different from the firſt ſix; if ſo, we would not be aſtricted by the Command to ſanctifie one (ſeeing the one inferreth and determineth the other, and they muſt go together) which were abſurd.</p>
               <p>Yet again, it may be made out that the reaſons preſs a ſeventh, and not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth by conſidering the words and force of the conſequence in both.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon is, <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour, but the ſeventh is the Lords.</hi> 1. It ſayeth not, take the firſt ſix, but of ſeven take ſix to labour, and give the Lord the ſeventh, for he has reſerved it to himſelf. 2. The ſame equity is in the inference for a ſeventh; that is, for the ſeventh, if not more; he has given thee ſix, therefore
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:31633:91"/>
give thou him a ſeventh, will conclude more formally then give him the ſeventh; a ſeventh is the ſeventh part of time as well as the ſeventh, which is the equity the Command goeth on. 3. Had the Command intended to inferr the ſeventh pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, it would have been more clearly expreſſed thus, he hath given thee the firſt ſix, therefore give thou him the ſeventh.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon from Gods example inferreth the ſame, he wrought ſix and reſted the ſeventh, do thou ſo likewiſe, and ſo theſe that work ſix and reſt a ſeventh (as we now do) follow Gods example, as well as they that wrought ſix and reſted the ſeventh did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. If the poſitive part of the Command muſt be expounded by the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, &amp; <hi>contra,</hi> then it concerneth one of ſeven, and not the ſeventh: But the firſt is true, 1. To poſitive part commandeth a day without reſpect to its order, therefore the negative doth ſo. 2. The negative is to be reſolved thus, ye ſhall not work above ſix, not thus, ye ſhall not work above the firſt ſix, as the event cleareth. 3. If it be not the firſt ſix, but ſix, that is, in the conceſſion, then it is not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, but a ſeventh that is in the inhibition, but the firſt is clear, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg</hi> 6. If this Command, for the ſubſtance of it, concern us, as being moral, and bind us to the firſt day, and the ſanctifying of it equally, as it obliged the Jews to the ſeventh; then its one day of ſeven and not the ſeventh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is intended primarily by it: But it bindeth us to the firſt, <hi>Ergo,</hi> That its moral, and bindeth us now, is cleared. Thus 1. it either bindeth to this day, or to nothing, therefore it primarily granteth ſix, and not the firſt ſix, for labour, and by clear conſeqnence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth primarily a ſeventh, and not the ſeventh, for a day of reſt. 2. If it be a ſin againſt this Command to break the Lords day or Chriſtian Sabbath, and prophane it, then it obligeth us to it, and that directly; for indirectly and by conſequence the breach of the Sabbath is a ſin againſt any, or all of the three former commands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. If the prophaning of the Sabbath be forbidden on this ground, becauſe it is the Lords (as it is in this Command) then prophaning of the Lords day is equally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in it, becauſe its the Lords, and is now appropriated to him according to his own will. 4. The Teſtimony of mens Conſciences, and the conſtant challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of all (when tender) as being guilty of breaking this Command when ever they prophane the Lords day, do convincingly hold forth that this Command concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and are as ſo many witneſſes of it; and conſequently prove that it is not the ſeventh day, but a ſeventh day, whether inſtituted, or to be inſtituted by God, which is the ſubſtance of it, and primarily commanded in it; for its never counted a breach of this Command to neglect to ſanctifie the ſeventh day, neither do the Conſciences of well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>informed Chriſtians challenge for that, though they do moſt bitterly for the other, as is ſaid.</p>
               <p>In ſum, ſuppoſe now the firſt day being inſtituted, that the Command were to ſanctifie the Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we would underſtand it of the firſt day, becauſe its already inſtituted; and the ſame reaſons will inforce it, even ſo the ſeventh day came in then, becauſe it was formerly inſtituted; beſide the Sabbatiſme ſignifieth not this or that day, but what day ſoever, ſhall be by God ſolemnly ſet, or is ſet apart for holy reſt; and the Command will run for our obſerving the Lords day, ſuppoſing its inſtitution as well as it did for that; although it more directly tye them, yet it doth ſo but as a reaſon, even as the preface prefixed to all the Commands, and the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:31633:92"/>
promiſe affixed to the fifth, concern them literally; yet are binding in ſo far as they are moral, as appeareth by the Apoſtles applying the laſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 2. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relation to that particular Land or People, but as applicable and common to any Land or People making conſcience of obedience to Gods commands.</p>
               <p>But here it may be objected, 1. The Jews kept the Seventh day. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Not by vertue of this command, but by its prior inſtitution, even as they were obliged to Sacrifices and Circumciſion by the ſecond command, though they were not particularly named in it. 2. So we are obliged to the keeping of the Firſt day of the week by this fourth Commandement: yet it followeth not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is expreſly commanded in it, there being indeed no particular day pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily at leaſt inſtituted in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be objected, But God reſted the Seventh day? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Gods reſt is not principally propoſed as the reaſon of that Seventh day, but that he reſted one day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after ſix imployed in the works of Creation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I'ts to inferr the number<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not the order, otherwaies it would not concern us. 2. The Seventh relateth not to the order of the dayes of the week, one, two, three, &amp;c, but it's called the Seventh with reſpect to the former Six of work.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the <hi>quoties</hi> and <hi>quamdiu,</hi> how often the Sabbath recurreth, and what is the day.</p>
               <p>It remaineth here to be inquired what is the beginning of the ſanctification of this day (which belongeth to the <hi>quando)</hi> or wherefrom we are to reckon it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it's granted by all to be a natural day; Now it is queſtioned mainly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its begininning is to be reckoned from evening about Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſetting or darkneſs, to Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſetting the next day, or if it be to be reckoned from morning, that is (as we fix it) when the Sun beginneth to aſcend towards us after midnight, which is morning largely taken, as its evening largely taken, when the Sun beginneth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline after mid-day.</p>
               <p>In this debate then, we take morning and evening largely, as they divide the whole natural day, ſo the morning is from twelve at night to twelve in the day, and the evening from twelve in the day to twelve at night: And it muſt be ſo here, for 1. <hi>Moſes; Gen.</hi> 1. divideth the natural day in morning and evening, which two put together, make up the whole day; and theſe ſix dayes, made up each of them of morning and evening, are natural dayes, the whole week being divided in ſeven of them: and that reckoning from Gods example is no doubt propoſed for our Imitation in this. Hence the morning watch was before day, and the morning ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice about nine of the clock, ſo the evening ſacrifice was about three in the afternoon, and the evening watch about nine at night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. It is granted by all, and is clear from this command, that as we account the ſix working dayes of the week, ſo muſt we account the ſeventh, for one muſt begin where another endeth; and if one of them begin at the evening or morning, all the reſt muſt do ſo likewiſe. 3. We ſuppoſe the ſanctifying of the ordinary Sabbath was from morning to evening, I ſay, of the ordinary Sabbath; becauſe for extraordinary Sabbaths, as of the <hi>Paſsover. Exod.</hi> 12. and of the <hi>Atonement, Levit.</hi> 23. there were ſpecial reaſons; and though otherwayes they were to be ſanctified as Sabbaths, yet that they were to begin in the evening before, was added as aſpecial ſolemnity of theſe ſolemn times, and therefore the example or inſtance of theſe will not be concludent
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:31633:92"/>
here to the prejudice of what we aſſert, but rather, to the contrary, ſeeing there is a particular excepting of them from the ordinary rule, and the particular intimation of their beginning in the evening, will rather confirm our aſſertion, that the ordinary Sabbaths did begin in the morning. 4. Its not queſtioned, if on the evening before, people ſhould be preparing for the Sabbath following, we ſaid that this is included in the word <hi>remember;</hi> but if we ſpeak of the Sabbath to begin at the evening before, then it will be comprehended as a part of the very day, and ſo it will conclude the work or obſervation of the day to cloſe at the next evening.</p>
               <p>We conceive, eſpecially to us Chriſtians, the day is to begin in the morning, as is ſaid, and to continue till the next morning, for which we reaſon thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. As other dayes begin, or as dayes began at the firſt, ſo muſt this, but days ordinarily begin in the morning, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If the firſt ſix of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s reckoning begin ſo, then this beginneth ſo alſo, but they do begin ſo, which may be cleared from <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. where the evening and the morning make the firſt day after the Creation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If there the morning and the evening do fully divide the natural day, then the morning muſt go before the evening, every morning being for its own evening: But they do divide the natural day, all being comprehended under ſix dayes, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. the conſequence is clear, to natural ſenſe, for the fore-noon, which is the morning muſt be before the afternoon, which is the evening; the aſcending of the Sun is ſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its declining, and ſeeing the morning natural (to ſpeak ſo) of the natural day, is from the twelfth hour at night, this muſt be the beginning of the day.</p>
               <p>Again, the queſtion then, being onely, whether to reckon the evening or the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning firſt; it would ſeem neceſſary to reckon the morning firſt; for if the evening be firſt, that evening muſt either be, 1. the evening of a day preceeding morning, ſeeing every evening ſuppoſeth a morning to go before it in proper ſpeech (and I ſuppoſe the Hiſtory of the Creation, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1. is not ſet down in metaphorical terms;) or 2. it muſt be an evening without a morning, and that in proper ſpeech (here uſed) is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and ſeems alſo to be as impoſſible in nature, to wit, that there should be a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and poſterior evening or afternoon, without a preceeding morning or forenoon, as that there should be an effect without a cauſe; or 3. it muſt be the evening follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its own morning, and ſo that morning muſt be loſt proceeding the firſt evening re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>The evening and the morning were the firſt day;</hi> which to affirm would not onely be abſurd, but would alſo manifeſtly faſten the loſs of a dayes time on the Scriptures calculation: and it ſeemeth hard in all ſpeech and Scripture-phraſe, to put evening before its own morning, ſeeing there muſt be both morning and evening in each day; neither doth the Scriptute ſpeak any way of evening, but when its drawing towards night, which ſtill ſuppoſeth the morning of that ſame day to be paſſed, or elſe we muſt divide the day in the middle of the Artificial day, and make the natural day begin at twelve of the noon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>day, which will be as much againſt the Scripture phraſe, that reckoneth ſtill the whole Artificial day as belonging to one natutal day, the Artificial day and night being the two parts of one whole natural day.</p>

There had not otherwiſe been any intermiſſion betwixt his labour and his reſt, which is yet ſuppoſed by diſtinguiſhing the dayes.</p>
               <p>Again, if by vertue of the command of a day to be ſanctified, we ſhould begin the night or the evening before, then, theſe two or three abſurdities would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, 1.

ſaid <hi>Luke</hi> 23. <hi>verſe</hi> 56. and 24. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. of the Women that ſtayed from the grave till the firſt day of the week, that they reſted according to the commandment on the Sabbath day, and early in the morning came to the Sepulchre. 3. Becauſe Chriſt accounteth a whole natural day, that which laſteth till men cannot work, 4. Gods working dayes (to ſay ſo) were ſuch, he made not any thing in the evening before the Firſt day. 5. The ordinary phraſe, <hi>To morrow is the holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, Exod.</hi> 16. 23, &amp;c. ſheweth that the day preſent will laſt till to morrow come, and to morrow is ever by an intervening night: So if on the forbidden day men may not work till to morrow, then that evening belongeth to it by this Command, and if on the ſixth day the ſeventh be not come till to morrow, that is, after the night intervene, then it doth not begin at even, but ſo it is in theſe places and phraſes.</p>
               <p>Yet again, its clear that in all the examples of ordinary Sabbaths keeping and ſanctifying in Scripture, they began in the morning: For inſtance, it is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 27. <hi>Some of the people went out to gather on the ſeventh day,</hi> no doubt, in the morning, for they knew well there was none of it to be found any day after the Suns waxing hot; they might have dreſſed of it the night before, and not been quarrelled with, they being forbidden gathering on the Sabbath: the proofs of the former Argument give light to this alſo.</p>
               <p>There are yet two Arguments to be added, which do eſpecially belong to us Chriſtians, for clearing the beginning of our Lords day to be in the morning; the firſt is taken from Chriſts Reſurrection thus:</p>
               <p>That day, and that time of the day, ought to be our Sabbath, and the beginning of it when the Lord began to reſt after finiſhing the work of Redemption, and aroſe; but that was the Firſt day in the week, in the morning, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. This bindeth us ſtrongly who take that day on which he aroſe to be our Chriſtian Sabbath.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is taken from the Hiſtory of Chriſts Paſſion and Reſurrection toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherein theſe things to this purpoſe are obſervable; 1. That he was laid in the Grave on Frydays night, being the preparation to the great Sabbath, which followed: 2. That the Woman who reſted and came not to the Grave till Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning (to uſe our known names) are ſaid to reſt according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, as if coming ſooner, had not been reſting according to it. 3. That his lying in the Grave muſt be accounted to be ſome time before the Fryday ended, other wayes he could not have been three dayes in the Grave, and therefore a part of Frydays night is reckoned to the Firſt day, then the whole Sabbath or Saturday is the ſecond, and laſtly a part of the night; to wit, from twelve a clock at night, belonging to the Firſt day or Sunday, ſtandeth for the third, and ſo he aroſe that morning, while it was yet dark, at which time, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, the Women came to the Grave, as ſoon as they could for the Sabbath, and therefore their Sabbath ſeventh-day ended then, and the Firſt day Sabbath began.</p>
               <p>We now come to the third general queſtion concerning the change, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the change of the ſeventh day into the Firſt day of the week; where firſt, we ſhall ſum up what is moral in this Command, and then ſecondly by ſome Propoſitions clear the change and its conſiſtency with this Command.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:31633:94"/>
To the firſt then, this Command doth morally and perpetually oblige to theſe: 1. That there be a ſolemn time ſet apart and obſerved for Worship: 2. That this should be one day of ſeven: 3. That it should be ſuch a day, the very day, which God commandeth, the Sabbath of his appointment, whatever day it should be: 4. That it be a whole natural day of twenty four hours, yet having an Artificial day together undivided: 5. That ſix, and no more but ſix; working dayes intervent, and that theſe be together in a week; and therefore 6. That the Sabbath be a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding day, dividing one working week from another; if then ſix working dayes muſt be in one week, and go together, this will follow alſo, that the Sabbath muſt be the firſt or laſt day of the ſeven.</p>
               <p>As for the Propoſitions clearing the change and conſiſtency of it with this command, the firſt shall be this.</p>
               <p>The Sabbath may be changed from the laſt or ſeventh day to the firſt day of the week, without any derogation to this command or inconſiſtency with it; for all that is moral in it, to wit, a day, and one day of ſeven, and a bounding ſeventh day, leaving ſix for work together, remain untouched by the change: beſide, the ſeventh day not having its inſtitution from this Command expreſly and directly, but only accidentally (the particular day whether the Jews ſeventh day, or the Chriſtians firſt day of the week being ſuppoſed by the fourth Commandment as inſtituted, or to be inſtituted elſewhere) as is ſaid, and its firſt inſtitution, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. being onely a poſitive and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Law, may be therefore changed, and yet the fourth Commandment keep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; we need not inſiſt in further proſecution of this Propoſition, much being ſpoken to it on the matter already.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> Not only may the ſeventh be altered from what it was under the Law to another ſeventh day under the Goſpel, but it is meet and convenient from good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) even in the Command) that it should be ſo.</p>
               <p>For 1. If theſe two ages, before Chriſt, and after him, be looked on as diverſe Worlds, and if the Redemption by Chriſt at his coming be accounted the making of the one, as Gods Creation was of the other, then its meet that when the World is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by Redemption, the Sabbath day should be changed for memory of that, as well as it was inſtituted at firſt for the memory of the former, there being the ſame reaſon for both: But they are looked on as two diſtinct worlds, and called ſo in the plural number, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 2. and this laſt World diſtinguished from the former, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 5. and the redeeming of the one is looked upon as the making of the other, therefore from that day forth the day of reſt is to be ſuch as may relate to both, now the day being changed to the firſt, it remembreth us of Gods reſt at the Creation by diſtinguishing ſix dayes from the ſeventh, and it remembreth us of the new Creation by putting Chriſts Reſurrection in the room of the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If the new World be a work as much for the glory of God, and as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to men, when its begun and cloſed or finished by the work of Redemption, as the making of the old World was, then the day of reſt of the new World is to be made to relate to that, much more, if the Redemption of the World be more for the glory of God, and for the comfort of men; then by the ground on which the ſeventh day was at firſt inſtituted, its alſo again to be changed, to wit, the memory of Gods great work; but both the former are true: <hi>Ergo,</hi> or thus, if the ground that made the ſeventh to be choſen for the Sabbath in the old World be changed in the new, and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ground agree better to another then to it; then it is to be changed: But the ground whereupon the old ſeventh day was preferred is now changed, &amp; there are grounds to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:31633:94"/>
prefer another day to it for the ſame ends; therefore it is meet the day be changed alſo: Or thus, f the perfecting of the work of Redemption, and the reſt of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor after it, be as much to be remembred as the work of Creation and Gods reſting after it, then the day is to be changed, but ſo it is, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If by Chriſt in the new World all the Levitical ſervices be changed, and the Ceremonial Worship of that day; then it is meet that the day alſo ſhould be changed: 1. For shewing the expiration of that Worship and Law, it being hard to keep that day, and to diſtinguish it from the Jewish former Worship: 2. To keep Chriſtians more Judaizing, and to abſtract them even from former ſervices of the Sabbath now abolished; juſt as now no particular family hath the Prieſthood, as <hi>Levi</hi> had it before, nor no particular Nation hath the Church confined in it, as that of the Jews had (though theſe were not typical properly) yea, it would be ſuch a day as would point out the evanishing of former Ceremonies, which the inbringing of the firſt day abundantly doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If the Worship and Ordinances of the new Goſpel-world be eminently to hold their Inſtitution of Chriſt the Mediator, and to be made ſome way relative to his Redemption paſt; then it is meet for that end that the Sabbath-day be changed, ſo as it may be dependant on him as all other worship is, that is moral-poſitive or poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral, and that cannot be done well, if the former day be kept unchanged, at leaſt not ſo well, as when it is changed; but the former is true, all Goſpel-worship holdeth of him Sacraments, Prayer, Praiſe, Miniſtry, &amp;c. (now Sacraments, as they ſeal are not ceremonial, for the Tree of Life was inſtituted to be a ſeal of the Covenant of works in the ſtate of Innocency before the fall, while there were no typical Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Saviour to come, and ſo Sacraments as they are Seals may be continued, as perpetual pieces of worship, without hazard of typifying a Saviour to come) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he inſtituted new ones, and that with relation to his work of Redemption, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as paſt: Hence alſo his Prayer or Pattern is called the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and his Sacrament of the Supper is called the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> becauſe inſtituted by him and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to him; in this ſence it is peculiarly ſaid <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 5. That God put in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him the World to come different from what was before, and he is put as the Son in the New Teſtament in the place of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was the Law-giver and faithful Servant in the Old, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. upon this ground we think that day is called, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. 10. the <hi>Lords day,</hi> to bring it in a dependance on Jeſus Chriſt, and to make it reſpect what is paſt of the work of Redemption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. If the day of ſolemn publick worship be a piece of Gods worship, capable of bearing a relation to Chriſt to come, and falling out under the Mediators Kingdom properly; then when he cometh in the new World, it is meet it should be changed. 1. To shew he is come. 2. To shew he is abſolute over the houſe and worship of God. 3. Some way to preach his Grace and Redemption in the very change of it: But it is a piece of Worship and Tribute of our time (as is ſaid before) and a piece of worship capable of his Inſtitution and Remembrance (therefore called the Lords day) which could not be, were not a day of worship capable of that; and it falleth under the power of Chriſt, who <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. <hi>Even as the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and why is that power pleaded in that particular of the day ſo often, if it were not to shew, that there is reaſon by his coming to look on the Sabbath as under him, even as all other worship was, which ſtood by Gods poſitive Command, even as this did?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. If by this Command the day of reſt from Gods moſt ſolemn work be to be our day of reſt; then after Chriſts coming (not ſo before) not the ſeventh, but the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:31633:95"/>
firſt day is to be obſerved; but by the command the former is true. Again, if that day be to be kept in reference to any ſolemn work of God, which was the firſt day after his perfecting it, then the Firſt day is to be kept: but by the command the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is true, becauſe our reſting day is to be kept in reference to the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and therefore muſt be on the Firſt day, which was the day after its cloſing and perfecting, as to Chriſts ſuffering and labour, though not as to its application, even as the ſeventh was of Gods reſting from the work of Creation, though not from his works of Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. If the ſeventh day which the Jews kept, had any peculiar tye or motive unto them, which by Chriſt is now taken away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it was meet that at Chriſts co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that day ſhould be changed. We would underſtand here, that there might be ſomewhat peculiar or typical in their ſeventh day, and yet nothing ſo in the fourth Command, which commandeth one of ſeven, but not the ſeventh: And though we could not particularly pitch upon what is typical or peculiar in it, yet may we conceive that ſomething there is, as in Tythes, Offerings, &amp;c. though the particular thing which is typified be hardly inſtructed: As 1. If its beginning was on the evening to them (as ſome think) the reaſon of it was peculiar, to wit, their coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> at evening, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. And in ſo far at leaſt it would be peculiar to them; And by Chriſts riſing in the morning is changed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's preſſed peculiarly on the account of Gods redeeming them from <hi>Egypt,</hi> they had that to think on, that ſometime they were, where they got not liberty to reſt any day, therefore ſhould they eaſe their Servants, as it is <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 14. 15. This holdeth eſpecially, if it was on the ſeventh day that their freedom from <hi>Egypt</hi> began, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.

               <p n="3">3. It was peculiarly diſcovered to them by Gods raining Manna from Heaven ſix dayes, and by his with holding it from them the ſeventh.</p>
               <p n="4">4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was peculiarly accompanied with ſpecial Ceremonial ſervices beyond other dayes.</p>
               <p n="5">5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gods manner of dealing with them before Chriſt, was to preſs duties by temporal and external advantages expreſly, and more implicitly by ſpiritual mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, therefore it was moſt agreeable to that way and time to preſs the ſeventh day on them which minded them of the benefit of Creation; but it's otherwiſe with the Church under the Goſpel: Hence their Sacraments had reſpect (externally) to their deliverance from <hi>Egypt</hi> and temporal things, whereas ours have reſpect purely to what is ſpiritual.</p>

The Spirits giving at <hi>Pentecoſt, Acts</hi> 2. will be found to be on the Firſt day of the week, now no other day can claim ſo many priviledges, and ſo many wayes relate to Chriſt.</p>

If the ground, upon which the ſeventh day under the Law was preferred during that World, do in this renewing of the World agree onely to the firſt day of the week; then is the firſt day to ſucceed; but theſe grounds proportionally agree onely to the firſt day under the Goſpel, which agreed to the ſeventh under the Law. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which made the ſeventh day preferrable was. 1. That God had ended all his works on the ſixth, and reſted the ſeventh; It was the firſt day after the Creation; ſo the firſt day of the Week is that day on which Chriſt roſe (having perfected the work of Redemption, and obtained victory over death, under whoſe power ſome way for a time his body was before that) and was thereby manifeſtly declared to be the Son of God, to wit, by his Reſurrection from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4.</p>

The force of the example will hold here: God made the World in ſix dayes, and reſted the ſeventh, therefore reſt ye with him; ſo Chriſt having for a time ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, fully overcame the firſt day, and began his eſtate of exaltation, therefore reſt with him, and rejoyce that day, it being the beginning of this new joy full World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No other day can be ſubſtituted in place of the old ſeventh day, reſerving intire the morality of this Command; therefore it muſt be this that is put in the place of that; for this Command requireth, 1. one day of every ſeven, allowing ſix of every ſeven to work, and that together: Now if the day had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sabbath enſuing, it had not been one day of ſeven, if it had been the ſecond, third, or fourth day, then the ſix working dayes had not gone together. But now the firſt being appointed for God next to the ſeventh, God hath his part or tribute called for, and then came ſix working dayes together unto us of that ſame week, and ſo ſtill they run, God hath One, and we have Six of the ſame week.</p>
               <p>If it be here objected, that this way, the new World is begun with a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, whereas the Sabbath cloſed and ended the old World. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Thus God hath no loſs of what he required; for this way, no week wanteth its Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:31633:96"/>
2. Its moſt ſuitable that the old World should end in a Sabbath, and the new begin in a Sabbath, that ſo the worship of the new (which moſt diſtinctly diſcovereth the change) might the more immediately and convincingly preach the change, which could not ſo well have been done i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> working dayes of both had met together, or a working day of the one, and the Sabbath of the other. 3. Though the old Sabbath was the ſeventh in order from the Creation, yet it was the firſt day after mans Creation, God beginning as it were, and entring him with that, even ſo when men are brought into this new World or change, God will begin it with gladneſs and joy to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 4. The day of ſolemn publick worship required to be obſerved by this Command, was really changed from the ſeventh or laſt day to the firſt day of the week, according to the former grounds. That it was really changed, may be made out by theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians after Chriſts Reſurrection and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, had their ſolemn day for meeting to worship God, yet neither did they by themſelves together in practiſe keep the ſeventh, nor by command appointed it to be kept, nor gave it the title of the <hi>Lords-day:</hi> Its true, that often they kept it in a ſort with the <hi>Jews,</hi> as they did <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> for the opportunity of the multitude coming together on theſe dayes, or to bury it with honour; as they did practiſe for a time ſeveral of the Jewish Rites antiquated for their gaining, and till they were fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of their abolition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in conſtituted Churches of the Gentiles, we never read that they kept it, but another day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians kept and eſteemed the firſt day for their ſolemn day, beyond and above all dayes, yea, and it onely as the Chriſtian Sabbath. For 1. on that day they uſed to meet ordinarily, and that not occaſionally, but purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and determinately, as <hi>John</hi> 20. verſe 19. and 26. which is clearly the firſt day. 2. They are purpoſely together, and not for fear (for fear ſcattereth) but while they are together, they do for fear shut the doors, being very probably led from the news of the Reſurrection to be together, and ſo gain, <hi>verſe</hi> 26. they meet, and Chriſt with them: And though it may poſſibly be, that on other dayes they met; yet doubtleſs this holdeth forth ſomething peculiar to this day, and ſome Leſſon to be taken from it: That 1. Chriſts coming to them is eſpecially tryſted on that day, and that while they are together. 2. That when they met at any other time, ere he came to them its never ſaid, they were or came together the ſecond, third, or fourth day of the week, but on the firſt; and wherefore doth the Holy Ghoſt record that day, or their meeting on that day, when he omitteth the naming of other dayes: but that that day in its Exerciſes may be eſpecially taken notice of, and though other dayes had been much alike in Exerciſes to them, yet the recording of this day ſo often, and omitting the other, intimateth a difference, ſure they are not alike in this, ſo much for the 20. of <hi>John,</hi> which is the firſt place of Scripture we make uſe of.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 1, 2. Here they are ſaid to be, <hi>all with one accord in one place when Pentecoſt</hi> came, where its clear, 1. That <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was on the firſt day of the week, for it was the fiftieth day after the Feaſt of unleavened bread: Now according to the Jews account, their Paſsover day was on the Sabbath (called <hi>John</hi> 19. 31. an high Sabbath) in which Chriſt lay all the day in the grave, as appeareth; for that day is called their preparation for the Feaſt, wherein Chriſt ſuffered which is our Friday; reckon now what will be the fiftieth day after, or <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and it will be found to be the firſt day of the week: And its not only obſervable for their meeting, but for Gods ſending the Spirit on them, as a ſpecial bleſſing of that day, and his countenancing of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:31633:96"/>
their worshipping him on it, according to his promiſe; 2. It is clear that they did meet together on this day. 3. That this meeting together was not a daily or ordinary meeting together (for <hi>John</hi> 21. we ſee they went to Fiſhing, and no queſtion ſometimes they went aſunder) for <hi>verſe</hi> 1. Its marked as a thing not ordinary to every day, that on that day they were altogether in one place. 4. It was not a meeting in reference to the <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> feaſt:</p>
               <p>For 1. They onely are together, diſtinct from the People. 2. Its not in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but in ſome other Houſe fit for their meeting together at publick Worship; it muſt be therefore, becauſe that day was the time of their ſolemn meeting, even their Chriſtian Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third place is Acts 20. 7.</hi> And upon the firſt day of the week, when the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples came together to break bread <hi>Paul</hi> preached unto them, &amp;c. <hi>where it is clear:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That this meeting was for publick Worship, as the breaking of Bread and Preaching intimateth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is ſome obſervableneſs in this Circumſtance, that it was on <hi>the firſt day of the week,</hi> and that that day is mentioned rather then any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſix dayes, in which he had been there at <hi>Troas.</hi> though its more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they had meetings and preaching on them alſo; but this is the onely and great difference, that their meetings on theſe dayes were occaſional, and it may be but partial (to ſpeak ſo) but the ſolemn chief fixt meeting of all, was uſually and ordinarily on the firſt day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This coming together on that day for theſe ends is ſpoken of, as a thing that was not new, nor occaſional; but as their cuſtomary, conſtant, known, Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; they came together purpoſely to break and to wait on other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Its clear, that by ſpecial applying of theſe Exerciſes to that day, and by mentioning of the day for that end, that, that day was their moſt ſolemn day, and that the old ſeventh day was not ſo (at leaſt neceſſarily) imployed by them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Neither is it like, That <hi>Paul,</hi> who was ready to depart, would have ſtayed for the firſt day of the week, if there had not been ſome ſolemn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in that, or that he would have paſſed the old ſeventh-day Sabbath, eſpecially to marring of his other occaſions had they been equal, if more ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification had been required in it, then in the firſt day of the week, or that he would have ſo much inſiſted in religious publick worship on that day, if the former ſeventh had been imployed in that ſervice, but here the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtituted of believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> there is no mention of the old Sabbath, but as of another common day of the week;</p>
               <p>Yea 6. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpending this whole day in that ſervice, and continuing his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon till midnight (yet accounting it ſtill one day) in ſolemn meeting doth confirm this day to be more then an ordinary day, or then other dayes of the week, as being ſpecially dedicated to theſe Services and Exerciſes, and totally ſpent in them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Its ſaid, that <hi>the Diſciples came together,</hi> they were not ſent for that day, but they came together being called and accuſtomed ſo to do on that day, and as being put to theſe duties by the day, as the proper Exerciſes in which it is to be ſpent.</p>
               <p>Hence we may argue; If the Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians did obſerve the Firſt day of the week, as their prime and chief time for ſolemn publick Worship,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:31633:97"/>
and did paſs over the old ſeventh day, then is the day changed from the ſeventh to the Firſt day of the week, but the firſt is cleared by the former Inſtances, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c</p>
               <p>And if theſe meetings on that Firſt day were not ſuch as uſed to be formerly on the ſeventh day, I deſire to know a reaſon: 1. Why their meetings on that day ſhould be particularly recorded rather then their meetings on any other day; and then 2. Why the one is ſo oft mentioned, and the other never, to wit that they met the ſecond, third day, &amp;c. of the week. Or 3. If their meeting on this Firſt day now (after Chriſts Aſcenſion) be not like his going to the Synagogue on the ſeventh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>day Sabbath, and doing ſuch and ſuch things on the Sabbath: that day being moſt frequently mentioned before, whereas now there is deep ſilence of that day, and the firſt day is recorded in its room, neither can the Scriptures ſpeaking of the one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſilence in the other be for no purpoſe, or for any other purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And as the practiſe of the Church holdeth out the change of the day, ſo doth the Title given, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10 to the firſt day of the week, to wit, the <hi>Lords day</hi> confirm the ſame, whence we argue.</p>
               <p>If the Title, which by the Lord and his people was given to the ſeventh-day Sabbath under the Old Teſtament, and under which, and by which, he claimeth a ſeventh-day in this Command; If I ſay that Title in the New Teſtament be not given unto the ſeventh, but unto the Firſt day of the week; then is the day chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the ſeventh day to the Firſt, and the Firſt falleth now under this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as the ſeventh formerly did; but the former is true, the Firſt is ſtyled as the ſeventh was, and as this Command ſtyleth and claimeth the day to the Lord to be obſerved for him; therefore now is the Sabbath changed from the ſeventh day to the Firſt day of the Week.</p>
               <p>The Titles whereby the Sabbath is diſtinguiſhed from other dayes, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly claimed and marked by God as his, and that in this ſame Command, muſt certainly evidence that day, which he hath ſet apart and doth claim as he applyeth them: And therefore if theſe Titles be given and applyed to the firſt day now, it muſt needs ſhew a ſucceeding of that day unto the former ſeventh, for during the Obſervation of the ſeventh day theſe Titles were not, nay could not be applyed to the Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no day being then the Lords but the ſeventh.</p>
               <p>Now we find that the ſeventh-day Sabbath is in the Old Teſtament ſtyled by the Lord under theſe Titles, and ſo claimed by him. 1. Its called here <hi>the Sabbath of the Lord,</hi> or <hi>to the Lord,</hi> that's the Lords, as contra diſtinguiſhed from the ſix dayes he hath given unto us, a day that he hath right to, and not we, therefore called <hi>the Lords Sabbath.</hi> 2. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 58. 3. Its claimed by the Lord as his, <hi>my holy day,</hi> which is ſo called 1. to diſtinguiſh it from other days. 2. To ſtamp it with the Lords mark in reſpect of its uſe, for it is not to be applyed to our uſe, but to his own, it being his in a ſpecial manner.</p>
               <p>But in the New Teſtament after Chriſts reſurrection, the ſeventh day is not ſo ſtyled and claimed, but the firſt day of the week is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1, 10. I was (ſaith <hi>John)</hi> in the Spirit on the <hi>Lords day:</hi> In which place theſe things are clear.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:31633:97"/>
1. That after Chriſts Aſcenſion, there was a peculiar day belonging to the Lord beſide and beyond other days.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it was not the old Sabbath, for 1. <hi>Johns</hi> ſcope being particularly to clear the time of the Viſion by the Circumſtance of the day, the particular day as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from other dayes, to call the Sabbath then uſed amongſt the Jews; the Lords day had more obſcured it then cleared it, yea 2. In that its called <hi>the Lord,</hi> according to the phraſe of the New Teſtament, it ſuppoſeth ſome relation to Chriſt the Mediator, as being derived from him which cannot be ſaid of the ſeventh day Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it was not any indefinite day of the Lord: For, 1. there is great odds betwixt the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and <hi>the day of the Lord,</hi> the former looketh to a conſtant ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial right and peculiar intereſt that God hath in that day beſide other dayes, even as when the ſeventh day was called <hi>his Day</hi> before, the Temple, <hi>his Temple,</hi> the preſcribed Service, <hi>his Service,</hi> and the Sacrament of the Supper, <hi>his Supper,</hi> &amp;c. 2. That day would be ſtill dark to the Church if it were indefinite, contrary to <hi>Johns</hi> ſcope.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That it is, and muſt be ſuch a day as was commonly ſet apart by Chriſtians to God as his; and that with reſpect to Chriſt the Mediator, and ſuch a day as was known to them; And by the former practiſes it is clear, that this day is the firſt day of the week, being the Lord Chriſts day, who now having conquered death; and gotten the victory, He doth therefore claim this day as a tribute to him.</p>
               <p>This being clear, that no other day can claim this title, and that the Firſt day hath good ground to claim it, we may put it out of queſtion, that it is the Firſt day or no day, or if it were not the Firſt, that to no purpoſe were the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of that day inſerted, ſeeing to no other day hath it been applyed, nor can it be applyed.</p>
               <p>This truth has been uncontroverted in all Antiquity, and almoſt by all Writers (till of late <hi>Gomarus</hi> beginneth to queſtion it) as <hi>Rivet</hi> cleareth on this Command againſt him.</p>
               <p>Now (ſuppoſing it as unqueſtionable that this is the very Firſt day) we are to inquire if the title applyed to this day be the ſame with that in the Command, and which uſually was given to the old ſeventh-day Sabbath, or that then Lords day.</p>
               <p>And it is clear, 1. That this title claimeth this day to God as his Day, it being poſſeſſively expreſt, as when we ſay, the Lords Throne, the Lords Altar, the Lords Sabbath, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It contra-diſtinguiſheth that day from other dayes, as if they were not ſo the Lords, but ours, like that in the Command, <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour, &amp;c. but the ſeventh is the Lords,</hi> ſo its the Lords in a peculiar way, we having leſſer right to imploy that day for our own uſe then any other day; and this claim of the Firſt day to the Lords, inferreth a condeſcenſion or diſpenſation whereby the laſt day beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ours, for had there been two dayes belonging to him, one day could not have been peculiarly called his; in which reſpect, 1 Cor. 11. <gap reason="foreign">

3. It layeth on a neceſſity of uſing it for the Lord, and not for our ſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its his, and will infer the ſame moral duties and ends which the Command obligeth to.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It will infer an appointment of Chriſts, whereby he appropriateth that day to his ſervice, and claimeth it to himſelf; why, becauſe he calleth it his, even as in the fourth Command there is no expreſs inſtitution of the ſeventh day, yet becauſe the ſev nth was called the Lords, and in his former way and diſpenſations intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a day to be kept for him, therefore it's underſtood and taken for granted by the Jews to be inſtituted, ſeeing he calleth it his; ſo may we conclude here, that there is an inſtitution and appointment of the Firſt day to be the Lords, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its claimed by him as his, although no ſuch plain expreſs inſtitution be of it as of other Ordinances, it being clear that the inſtitution of dayes is left more generally to be gathered: From all which we may gather the coucluſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, that the Firſt day of the week is ſtiled by the ſame peculiar Titles clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Lord expreſly as his right and due, and upon as valid grounds under the New Teſtament, as the ſeventh day was under the Old; Therefore now the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day is changed, and the Firſt is come in its room, which was the thing to be proved.</p>
               <p>In the laſt room we argue from the Apoſtles Ordinance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2. concerning contributions for the Saints; <hi>As I have</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) given order to the Churches of</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, <hi>even ſo do ye,</hi> that is, <hi>the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay we argue t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us, That not the ſeventh, but the firſt day, is the chief ſolemn day for worship after Chriſts Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>If the Firſt day of the week be particularly and eminently pitched on by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and that in diverſe Churches as the fitteſt time for expreſſing their Charity, then muſt there be ſomewhat eminent in the Firſt day, giving ground for ſuch an appointment and ordinance, as the Apoſtles ſingling that from other dayes for ſuch an end (and no other reaſon can be given, but that that day being more eſpecially and immediately appointed for God, is moſt fit for that duty, which is a Work of Mercy) but its there clear, that the Apoſtle pitcheth ſingularly on that day beſide other dayes, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For ſtrengthening of the Argument, conſider 1. That it's clear to be the firſt day of the week, ſince that ſame phraſe which is uſed by the Evangeliſts, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 1. <hi>Mark</hi> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 1. is made uſe of here by the Apoſtle, who no queſtion followeth the Evangeliſts phraſe, yea his following that phraſe may hint at a reaſon, why he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth Charity to be on that day, or ſets it apart for that uſe as beyond other dayes, to wit, our Lords Reſurrection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its clear, that he thinketh it not indifferent what day it be done on, nor that all days are alike, therefore he pitcheth on that day, the firſt day, and that not in one Church onely, but in many.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this is not commended onely to them, but commanded and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned even in reference to the day, and will the Apoſtle load Churches with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in that circumſtance without ground, and univerſally (to ſpeak ſo) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer one day to another, and ſo as he will have uniformity in the very day in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> with other Churches unneceſſarily? Let it not be ſaid, nay nor thought.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That this day was commanded even in the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> in which Churches he had condemned the obſervation of dayes, whereby it would ſeem to be clear, that he counteth not the preferring of this firſt day, as one of theſe dayes the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:31633:98"/>
obſervation whereof is prohibited and condemned by him, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> willeth it to be laid aſide; and that purpoſely he paſſed the ſeventh day as amongſt theſe dayes, which were not to be obſerved and retained but laid aſide.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the thing required is a duty of the Sabbath, being a work of mercy, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58. giving bread to the hungry, is mentioned particularly, as one of the duties of Gods Holy day.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the mentioning of the <hi>Firſt day</hi> of the week muſt be looked on, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to, and as compared with, the practiſe of keeping ſolemn meetings on that day, and this Command of doing this on the Firſt day of the week muſt be more ſtrong, and infer ſomewhat more being compared with other places, then if ſuch things were not recorded other wayes of the Firſt day.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This Command ſuppoſeth them to be already acquainted with ſome ſpecial pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Firſt day beyond others, when he commendeth this as a motive to them to be more charitable, to wit, that it was to be done on that day.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That there muſt be ſome peculiar thing in this day making it fit, yea more fit for ſuch a purpoſe, as doing works of Charity on it; rather then on any other: And the Apoſtles commanding this (and that in many Churches) doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe a reaſon why he doth it, drawn from ſome fitneſs of this day by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now, if we will enquire, no reaſon can be given but that the ſeventh-day Sabbath was expired, and that this firſt day was inſtituted in its place, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe any day was alike; yea, the ſeventh-day being the laſt day of the week, and the day when men uſually reckon their weeks ſucceſs, it would ſeem more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for this end, that men at the cloſe of the week ſhould lay up by them, as God had bleſſed them, then to reſerve it, to the beginning of another week, were not the firſt day more eſpecially to be ſanctified then the laſt, and the laſt to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but an ordinary working day: The fitneſs then floweth from this, that the firſt day of the week being the day of their ſolemn Communion with God, and with one another, and the day of their partaking moſt liberally of ſpiritual bleſſings from him, that therefore they should be moſt readily warmed in their affections, and be moſt liberal in their Communications to ſuch as wanted, eſpecially if we conſider the Jews to be parties for whom that Collection or Contribution was; Its the Apoſtles great Argument, whereby he pleadeth for Charity to the poor Jews from the Chriſtian Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 26, 27. That the Gentiles were their Debtors in temporals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had received ſpiritual things from them; now this argument is moſt fresh and powerful, when Believers do on the firſt day of the week record Gods priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with his Ordinances, and giving them his day in place of the Ordinances and day, which the Jews once had, and yet deriving theſe unto them by the Jews, I ſay, this Argument will then be moſt fresh to incite to that duty in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>

Can it be by gueſs or accident (to ſpeak ſo) that ſo many priviledges are fallen on that day? And that ſo manie things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of it, and aſtricted to it by commands, which is not done of, and to, any other dayes: And if one place would not ſuffice to prove, that the firſt day and not the ſeventh day was preferred by the Apoſtles, as the chief day of ſolemn publick

worſhip, yet all theſe things put together muſt prove a preference in that day, or we muſt ſay that the Pen-men of Holy Scripture have been very partial, who have marked many things, and recorded them concerning Gods Worſhip on that day, and have never ſo much as once for ſolemn Service named<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what was done on the ſecond, third, fourth, fifth dayes; we muſt either ſay, that this is inadvertently done (which were blaſphemy conſidering by what Spirit they wrote) or we muſt ſay its done to put a preference on that day, and to ſhew that its eſpecially to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, as the moſt ſolemn day for Gods worſhip by Chriſtians (which is the thing to be confirmed) for, the day that's claimed as the Lords, kept for him, and ſingularly marked to be priviledged beyond other days, muſt be his day; but this Firſt day is ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propoſ</hi> 5. This change of the day whereby the ſeventh is laid aſide, and the firſt ſubſtituted in its room, is of divine authority and inſtitution; and not by any meer humane or Eccleſiaſtick Conſtitution. I conceive there is indeed no mids here betwixt a Divine Inſtitution, which hath Gods warrant and authority ſtamped on it, and for Conſcience ſake is to be obſerved as being obligatory thereof, and that immediately; and humane or Eccleſiaſtick Conſtitutions, which may reach the external man, but in the matters of worſhip cannot bind the Conſcience or impoſe them as neceſſary: Now that this change is not by the laſt, but by the firſt, we prove theſe ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thus, if it be not humane or Eccleſiaſtick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it muſt be Divine, but it is not humane or Eccleſiaſtick, <hi>ergo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> its Divine: That it is not humane will appear 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it reach the Conſcience, and that immediately; then it's not humane but Divine, but it doth ſo. 2. If no man or Church on Earth have power to alter Gods day, now, nay, nor ſimply, or at all, then its not humane or Eccleſiaſtick, but firſt, none can change it, as we might clear from great abſurdities, that would follow. 2. If any Church have this power let them ſhew it, the Old Church had it not, neither the new, as is cleared in the firſt queſtion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We proceed to evince this change to be by Divine Inſtitution theſe four wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From reaſons flowing from Scripture, or Conſequences drawn from it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. Thus, where by genuine and native Conſequences drawn from Scripture any thing is ſo impoſed, as it cannot without ſin be altered or neglected, there is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution; but in the change of the ſeventh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>day Sabbath to the Firſt ſuch Conſequences may be drawn from Scripture, as will (upon ſuppoſition of the change) a ſtrict it to the Firſt day, ſo as that cannot be altered or neglected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, <hi>Ergo,</hi> its of Divine Inſtitution: The queſtion can be only of the <hi>minor,</hi> which is made out from what is ſaid in the third Propoſition, thus:</p>
               <p>If theſe very grounds which plead the conveniency of the change ſimply, do plead the conveniency of that change to the Firſt day, then by clear and unforced Conſequence, the firſt day is choſen and cannot without ſin be paſſed by, altered or neglected, except we ſay theſe reaſons have no weight; but theſe very grounds will be found to plead for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to be applicable to, the Firſt day of the week alone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and therefore beſide all other dayes in the new World it may be called the day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which God ſpecially made, as it is the day of Chriſts reſt from the work of Redemption, anſwerable to Gods reſt after the Creation, &amp;c. and therefore as
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:31633:100"/>
being moſt conducible to that end, the Firſt day cannot be without ſin paſt by, neglected or altered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus, if the very day of Chriſts reſt in the new World be to be reſted on, and ſanctified as the Sabbath, then the Firſt day is to be reſted on and ſanctified; but by Analogy from the works of Creation, we may ſee that the Firſt day of reſt after the finiſhing of the work of Redemption is to be ſanctified, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 118. is very conſiderable to this purpoſe, wherein there is 1. a Prophecy of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a day which God hath ſingularly made for us to joy in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. That day is the day wherein the rejected ſtone is made the head of the Corner, which day is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4 to be the Reſurrection day, yea, ſuppoſe that day there doth ſignifie the time of the Goſpel, wherein we ſhould joy, yet even that way, the firſt day is by proportion that day eminently, wherein Chriſts Victory was manifeſted, and ſo the day wherein Chriſtians ought eſpecially to rejoyce.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way we may reaſon for the change to be by Divine Inſtitution, is from this Command: If (ſuppoſing ſtill a change) by the morality of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the ſeventh can be changed into no day but the firſt day of the week<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then is the change into the firſt day, of Divine Inſtitution (for ſo that muſt neceſſarily be, which is by vertue of a Command) but by this Command no other day can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; for each week is divided in ſix working dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and theſe together to us, and one of reſt and that to God; now by changing it to the firſt God getteth one, and we ſix and that together; but if the day were the ſecond third, fourth, &amp;c. it would not be ſo; for the ſix working dayes would be interrupted, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that morality of the Command, whereby our dayes are diſtinguiſhed from his, that ours, for one week being fully by, we may with the greater freedom give God his.</p>
               <p>The third way we take to prove the change of the day to be by Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this: If by the practiſe of the Apoſtles, who were guided and inſpired by the Spirit in things belonging to their Office infallibly, this day was obſerved as different from other dayes; then there is a Divine Inſtitution of, and warrant for, this day; but by the practiſe of the Apoſtles this day is celebrated as different from, and preferred to, other dayes, or as Divine, therefore its of Divine Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: If the Divine practiſe and example of the Apoſtles in things moral and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, do not either ſuppoſe a Divine antecedent inſtitution, or infer a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, then their practiſe and example, which in theſe things is infallible and uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, will have no more force then the example of others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which were abſurd, their examples being eſpecially preſſed on us; and if in any thing their example be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, it muſt be in this ſo particularly and ſo well circumſtantiated; and where their meeting is not recorded to have been on any other ſecond, third, &amp;c. day, certainly their practiſe muſt be not onely more then nothing, but very ſignificant; and indeed in poſitive worſhip, the Lord hath been pleaſed to be more ſparing (to ſay ſo) and to leave us more to gather from Examples then in negatives, as in the poſitive part of ſwearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> admitting of Church members, in government, baptiſm and admiſſion to the Supper, yet none can ſay that there is no Scripture Inſtitution in theſe, where there may be ſuch grounds or examples.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Divine Inſtitution of the change may be argued from the title thus, if that which is called the <hi>Lords,</hi> be his by Divine Inſtitution and ſeparation from
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:31633:101"/>
other things not ſo called; then this firſt day muſt be his by Divine Inſtitution and ſeparation from other dayes, but all that is called the Lords, is his after this manner: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Let the <hi>minor</hi> be confirmed theſe three wayes; 1. By looking to what is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lords generally in the Old Teſtament, as his Houſe, his Altar, his Prieſts, his Tithes, &amp;c. are they not ſtill his, becauſe by him ſeparate for diſtinct uſes in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: 2. By looking more particularly, how the ſeventh day was called his day, or the Sabbath his, is not this the reaſon, becauſe it was appointed by him for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship beſide other dayes? And can any reaſon agree better to this? 3. By looking how any thing is called the Lords in the New Teſtament, there is no other or better phraſe or deſignation to try by, then that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20, 21. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, even as this firſt day, called the <hi>Lords day,</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to our dayes or common days, and that is called the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> becauſe inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by him, for ſuch and ſuch ſpiritual ends and uſes: And therefore there can be no better ground gotten for shewing why this is called the Lords day beſide others, then by comparing it with other Scriptures, and if in other things that phraſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a Divine inſtitution, why not in this? I do not mean that this is an inſtitution, or that it will prove that there muſt be a clear and expreſs inſtitution shewn but I mean this, that it will inferr there is one, and that it is Divine, ſeeing God is to chooſe and not we. We might here again produce the four Witneſſes already atteſted for the morality of this fourth Command, to wit, 1. the general practiſe of primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, 2. their general opinion and judgement, 3. mens Conſciences, 4. the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations of God; which will alſo all clearly depone in this, about the change of the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 6. Although we know not the peremptory and preciſe time when this day was inſtituted, and the very firſt day ſanctified, nor whether it was immediately by Chriſt, or mediately from him by the Apoſtles inſtituted, which is of no great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to the main of its inſtitution; yet we think it moſt probable that our Lord did from the very day of his Reſurrection either himſelf inſtitute it, while as <hi>Acts</hi> 1. v. 3 he taught them what concerned the Kingdom of God; or did inſpire his Apoſtles to obſerve it from that time forth; Becauſe, 1. If it was not then inſtituted, the Church had for ſome time wanted a Sabbath, the ſeventh-day Sabbath being expired by the Reſurrection. 2. The reaſon moving the change and preferring the firſt day before others, as in a nearer capacity of ſanctification for that end, was from that time forth. 3. The Apoſtles practiſe of meeting, and Chriſts keeping with them, hath been from the firſt change, even on the firſt two firſt dayes of the week, <hi>John</hi> 20. verſe 19. 26. 4. All the practiſes and other grounds whereby the change is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced, ſuppoſe ſtill the inſtitution to preceed; which maketh it appear to be very ancient.</p>
               <p>And ſo we reſume and cloſe theſe ſix propoſitions. 1. The day may be changed from the laſt to the firſt: 2. Its meet it should be ſo, and there is good reaſon for it: 3. It can onely be to one firſt: 4. Its ſo changed actually: 5. Its change is not by Humane, but by Divine inſtitution: 6. Its inſtitution ſeemeth to be from the riſe of the Goſpel Church, and the very day of Chriſts Reſurrection. Hence we infer 1. good warrant, even Gods warrant for imploying the ſeventh-day to our ſelves, ſeeing God ſeeketh but one day in ſeven, and now has choſen and claimeth the firſt. 2. Gods war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for ſanctifying the firſt day Sabbath or the Lords day as his inſtitution. 3. That the Lords day is to be ſanctified by us Chriſtians, and that by vertue of this Command, as the ſeventh-day was by the Jews on its grounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:31633:101"/>
We come now to ſpeak of the ſanctification of this day, which is the main thing, and for which all the reſt is intended, we ſhall firſt conſider the precept, and then 2. the reaſons whereby it is inforced.</p>
               <p>The precept is, <hi>ſanctify it,</hi> or <hi>keep it holy,</hi> ſanctifying of it is twice mentioned in this Command. 1. In the end, its ſaid God <hi>hallowed</hi> or <hi>ſanctified</hi> it, that is by ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, deſtination, and appointment for holy uſes, and as a part of worſhip, ſo he ſanctified the Temple, Altar, &amp;c. not by infuſing any holineſs in them, but by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing them for holy uſes: Thus onely God can ſanctifie a day, or any other thing ſo as to make it a part of worſhip, and no man or power on Earth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomever can do that. 1. In the precept it ſelf we are commanded to ſanctifie it, that is, by the application of it unto the uſes wherefore he hath ſet it apart; thus we ſanctify what he hath ſanctified when we uſe it and imploy it, according to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. And ſo we are to conſider, the ſanctifying of this day in theſe duties called for from us on it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>This ſanctification is two wayes ſet down. 3. In its ceſſation and reſt, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it from other uſes, and ſo keeping it from the common uſes, to which other dayes may and uſe to be applied: 1. In its ſpecial application to and imployment in holy uſes.</p>
               <p>For clearneſs, we ſhall conſider this ſanctification. 1. In reſpect of its reſt, what we are to abſtain from: 2. Comparatively, with that ſtrictneſs called for from the Jews: 3. Eminently, what is required more as to holineſs this day then on other dayes wherein alſo the Lords people ſhould be holy? and wherein this goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond theſe? 4. Poſitively, in what duties it ſhould be taken up: 5. Complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in reſpect of what is called for to the right ſanctifying of that day before it come on, in the time of it, and after it is paſt, and that in publick and private, and by all relations, Maſter, Servant, &amp;c. and throughout the whole man, thoughts, words, and deeds, and throughout the whole day: 6 Oppoſitively, or negatively, what are the breaches of this Command, and the aggravations of theſe ſins which break it.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, we conſider it in its reſt, which is required; and becauſe there are extreams, ſome giving it too little, as the Jews did before the captivity; ſome too much, even to being ſuperſtitious, as the Jews after the Captivity, and the Scribes and Phariſees particularly in Chriſts time did; ſtreaching this reſt too far. We muſt therefore conſider it more narrowly and particularly for quieting of our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the Jews are by the Prophets, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 17. and by Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. reproved for both extreams reſpectively.</p>
               <p>We do then in this matter aſſert firſt, That there is a reſt required here, which is extenſive to a mans words, thoughts, and actions, whereby many things lawful on other dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> become unlawful on this day.</p>
               <p>Yet 2. we aſſert, That by this reſt all ſort of actions are not condemned, but only ſuch as are in conſiſtent with the end and ſcope of this Command, as by other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and the practiſe of Chriſt and the Saints is clear: we conceive therefore theſe to be permitted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All duties of Piety, as was ſacrificing under the Old Teſtament, or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing or going about the Sacraments under the New Teſtament: In which ſenſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12, our Lord ſaith, the Prieſts prophaned the Sabbath and were
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:31633:102"/>
blameleſs, not that formally they prophaned the Sabbath, or did indeed break that Command, but materially they wrought in killing beaſts, &amp;c. which had been unlawful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had it not been in the exerciſes of piety.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> things that have a tendency, as neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> helps and means to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the former works of piety, are lawful, as going to the Congregation to hear the Law, calling the Aſſembly for worſhip by Trumpets, or Bells, or by a Voice, journeying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> going or riding to Church, &amp;c. becauſe the duties of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath cannot well be done without ſome of theſe, not at all without others of them.</p>
               <p>If it ſhould be asked here, What that, which is called <hi>a Sabbaths day journey, Acts</hi> 1. 12. was among the Jews? and whence it came, and what way may it be ſtinted or limited among Chriſtians? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was to them 2000. Cubits, which according to the different meaſuring of that diſtance of ground conſiſting of theſe 2000 Cubits by a leſſer or longer Cubit, is reckoned to be more or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſs by learned Men; but all agree (ſays <hi>Goodwin</hi> in his <hi>Moſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Aaron)</hi> in this, that theſe 2000. Cubits was a Sabbath days journey.</p>
               <p>It aroſe to be reckoned ſo from theſe grounds; 1. From their expounding, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 29. <hi>Let none go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of his place;</hi> thus, Let none go without the bounds of the City, which with its Suburbs was 2000. Cubits, or a mile about. 2. That the Tabernacle of the Congregation was ſo far from the Tents of theſe who pitched about it in the Wilderneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. as they ſuppoſed; and that the Prieſts kept that diſtance from the people in entering with the Ark into <hi>Iordan, Joſ</hi> 3. 4. whence they gathered that a man might ſtill go to the Ark or place of worſhip, as it was then in theſe caſes at a diſtance from them, and no further on the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>But we ſay whatever ſuperſtitiouſly or on cuſtome they took up (for that is but their Tradition) we cannot ſtint a Sabbath dayes journey to ſo many miles, fewer or more, but it muſt be as the man is in providence caſt to reſide further from, or nearer to the place where the Ordinances are diſpenſed; for one may go many miles and not prophane the Sabbath, if he cannot have the publick Ordinances nearer, whereas another may break the Sabbath by going but to his Neighbours door, yea by walking in his own houſe, or to his door, if either it be done idly, or with reſpect to another civil or worldly end, which agreeth not to that day; it is not here remoteneſs or nearneſs, but what ſweyeth us, and what is our end, that we are to try by.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All works of mercy are lawful on that day, as laying beſide us ſomething to the poor. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 16. verſe 1. ſending or dealing ſomething to thoſe who are in want, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58. verſe 7. viſiting others, to comfort; ſtrengthen, or otherwayes to edifie them chriſtianly; though idle and carnal viſits (albeit, alace! too rife) are not permitted.</p>

(that he might take that opportunity by his ſpiritual diſcourſe to edifie the Company as he did notably) which he would not have done had it been unlawful to dreſs any meat on the Sabbath, yet his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was ſuch at that Feaſt moſt remarkably, that it would be followed as a pattern by ſuch as may be invited by others to eat with them, and ſhall be diſpoſed to go on the Sabbath: And if this were the deſign of the inviters and invited, mens eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on that day would not readily prejudice the ſanctification of it, as very often it doth: Such is flying on the Lords day from a deſtroying enemy, and in other warranted caſes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. defending our ſelves againſt unjuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>By all which Believers have allowance, 1. for piety, 2. for charity, 3. for what is needful for their beaſts, 4. what is needful and convenient, or comely for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and more is not neceſſary: In theſe the Lord hath not ſtreightned them, neither hath he pinched and pinned them up to abſolute neceſſity, but hath left them to walk by Chriſtian prudence (yet ſo as they may not exceed) for the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples poſſibly might have endured that hunger, and not pluckt the ears of Corn, or beaſts may live a day without water, and not be much the worſe, or ſome ſort of Victuals may be provided to be ſet beſide men on the Sabbath needing no dreſſing or preparing; yea, a man may live on little or nothing for one day: but the Lord hath thought good not to ſtreighten them, ſo as to make his day and worſhip a wearineſs and burden unto them, ſeeing he hath made the Sabbath for man, to be refreſhing to him, and not man for the Sabbath; nor will he have their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be fettered with inextricable ſcruples: He leaveth it to men on other days how much to eat and drink by a Chriſtian prudence (yet alloweth them not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed even on theſe) ſo here there is ſome latitude left to conſcientious reaſon to walk by; for ſome may do ſomething at one time, and not at another, yea, one man may take more pains in upholding his body then is called for from another who is ſtronger, ſo that its impoſſible to ſet particular rules which will agree to all, but men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would look, 1. to their end, 2. to their need, 3. to what may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently attain the end.</p>
               <p>Yet it is needful here to add ſome qualifications or caveats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt folk indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too much, and exceed under the pretext of the former liberty, which the Lord hath condeſcended to leave men at,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That men would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſee that the neceſſity be real, that real ſickneſs keepeth at home, that real hazard maketh them flie, or maketh them bide at home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it be ſuch a neceſſity as they ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>not contrive a way conveniently to evite when it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, or could not foreſee before it came.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:31633:103"/>
2. Men would ſee that, that neceſſity be not brought on by themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the thing might have been done at another, time that neceſſity will not excuſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though if the ſin be taken with, and repented of, and Chriſt fled unto for the pardon of it, we may go about the doing that lawfully which ſinfully we have neceſſitated our ſelves unto; as ſuppoſe one had got warning to flie the day before, to bring ſuch a Phyſician, or to provide ſuch drugs, &amp;c. if he did it not, then he ſinneth, yet when neceſſity cometh he may ſtill do it, but not with a good Conſcience, till he firſt acknowledge the former fault of his neglect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It would be adverted, if that thing may be done, as well another time, or may not without prejudice (that is conſiderable) be delayed till the next day; Thus taking or giving of Phyſick on the Lords day, making ordinary civil viſits, beginning voyages, &amp;c. will not ſuſtain and bear weight before God, when folk do them that day, to have their own work day free, and ſo put by the proper duties of the Lords day, for ſome things that may be done the day or dayes following: Thus reſt is commanded <hi>Exod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 34. 21, even in ſowing rime and Harveſt; becauſe the neceſſity is not clear, but dependeth on ordinary providence, and folks are to expect occaſion and opportunities for them afterward.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Men would take heed that they have not a tickling complacency that ſuch neceſſities fall on the Sabbath, and be not glad to have diverſions from the proper duties of the day. They would go about ſuch works with a ſort of ſadneſs, though yet with clearneſs and peace of Conſcience as to their lawfulneſs: Therefore Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples, Matth. 24. 20. <hi>pray that your flight be not on the Sabbath day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> becauſe it would be heavy to Gods people to flie on that day, though it was lawfull.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We would ſee that it marr not a ſpiritual frame, and that in doing theſe we turn not to mind the World as on other dayes; There would be ſtill a reſpect to the day in our frame (which is called for in the word <hi>remember)</hi> and even when our hand is otherwayes imployed, the heart ſhould not be taken up with theſe things, but ſo far as is neceſſary to the acting of them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It would be adverted to, that they be done without inregularity, and ſo as not to give offence by them (hence it was that Chriſt ever gave the reaſons of what he did on the Sabbath) leſt others, not knowing our neceſſity, judge us guilty of Sabbath-breaking, or be involved without neceſſity to do the like,</p>
               <p n="7">7. Folks would have great reſpect to the end in theſe works, and to the motive which ſwayeth and putteth them on. If it be outward gain or fear of ſome tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral loſs; as if for gaining money a Phyſician ſhould go rather on the Sabbath then on another day to ſave the life of a man; that turneth then to be a ſervile work, and one of his ordinary Week day calling (to ſpeak ſo:) So if a Miniſter ſhould preach with reſpect to gain or applauſe on the Sabbath, or if any man ſhould make a viſit for a meer civil end, as we viſit on other dayes, without a ſuitable reſpect to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual edification or furtherance of Piety, it will marr all, and will be found a breach of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We would beware of ſpending too much time in theſe things, but would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour timely and quickly to expede and diſpatch them, and rightly to tryſt them:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:31633:103"/>
Dreſſing of meat, and trimming, adorning, and busking of folks bodies will not be found a well ſpent part of the Sabbath, when it ſhutteth out other duties, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth too much time, as it doth with many.</p>
               <p>By all which we may ſee what need there is to watch over our ſelves in theſe things, leſt our liberty be turned into licentiouſneſs, and leſt we grow either idle or carnal on that day.</p>
               <p>Let us then conſider how far this reſt extendeth: and under it we take in. 1. The reſt of the whole man, outward and inward, in deeds, words, and thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo is it <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58. 13. we ſhould not ſpeak our own words (nor by proportion think our own thoughts) nor find our own pleaſures. 2. It goeth through the whole day, for though every minute of the day cannot be applyed to poſitive duties, yet in no minute of it, is it lawful to do another work (inconſiſtent with the qualifications and ſcope aforeſaid) that is the negative part in it, <hi>thou ſhalt do no work,</hi> which bindeth <hi>ad ſemper.</hi> 3. It is to be extended not onely to a mans own perſon, but to all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, children, ſervants, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he muſt be anſwerable for it, that they reſt, and muſt give them no occaſion of work. 4. Its to be extended even to the leaſt work of any ſort, if unneceſſary, as gathering ſticks, ſpeaking our own word, &amp;c. theſe are all breaches of the Sabbath. 5. This reſt extendeth to all actions or ſorts of actions or caſes which are not comprehended under the former exceptions which are permitted, or are conſiſtent with the ſanctifying of the Sabbath: As;</p>
               <p n="1">1. All works which tend to our external profit, pleaſure, ſatisfaction, &amp;c. all works of our callings which make for the increaſe of outward gain and profit, ſuch whereby we ordinarily ſuſtain our lives: Theſe <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 15. are called our own works, and here its ſuch works as ordinarily are wrought in the reſt of the ſix dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So it is doing thy own pleaſure as well as works, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such works as tend to others external gain or profit as the great motive of them, as Servants may be working for their Maſters profit, and yet prophane the day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Such as are not neceſſary on that day, as ploughing, ſowing, reaping, or gathering in, and that even in Seed-time and Harveſt; and ſo fiſhing, going of mills, &amp;c. when theſe are not done for the very preſerving of life, becauſe they are not neceſſary out of that caſe; neither is there any thing here of an extraordinary diſpenſation that maketh them neceſſary, the weather depending on an ordinary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providence, or ordinarily depending on providence, which is to be reve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>renced: Hence though the weather and ſeaſon be rainy, yet it is not lawful to cut down or gather in Corn on the Sabbath, their hazard in this eaſe being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and from an ordinary immediate providence; yet ſuppoſe that a River were carrying away Corn, or that Winds were like to blow them into the Sea, it were lawful in ſuch a caſe to endeavour to prevent that, and preſerve them; becauſe 1. that cometh by ſome more then ordinary diſpenſation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the weather, and affecteth and putteth in hazard this Corn more then others: 2. Becauſe there is no probability of recovering theſe in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way, though the weather ſhould alter, but there is hope of gathering in of ſuch as are in the fields without that reach of hazard, if the Lord alter the ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such as are for carnal pleaſure or civil ends, thus playing, gaming, much
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:31633:104"/>
laughing, &amp;c. being our own works, more eſpecially our own pleaſure, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful on that day.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider that all things are prohibited which marr the end of the day, and are not conſiſtent with the duties thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch are buying, ſelling, &amp;c. out of the caſes of preſſing neceſſity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> folks cannot be ſpiritually taken up, and with theſe alſo; ſo playing and gaming is no leſs conſiſtent with praying, reading, conferring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. then ploughing or ſuch like, yea, is much more indiſpoſing for it, and ſo we do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily thereby incapacitate our ſelves for the duties of the day.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All things are forbidden, which conſiſt not with this reſt and the duties of worſhip called for from our ſelves and others; thus unneceſſary journeying, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even ſuppoſe one could or ſhould be exerciſed in meditation, is not reſting as is required, much leſs is gadding in companies, in the ſtreet, or fields, to the neglect of ſecret and family duties.</p>
               <p>In a word, whatever is not religious and ſpiritual exerciſe, or furthering or hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping unto what is ſo, out of the excepted caſes; much more whatever is ſinful, ſcandalous or unſuitable on other dayes, or doth divert from, or indiſpoſe for the duties of holineſs, and the worſhip of God on that day, is inconſiſtent with this reſt, and ſo prohibited: for, This reſt is not primarily commanded and required for it ſelf, but as conducing and ſubordinate unto the performing of holy duties in it; therefore our reſt is to be regulated, ſo as may beſt contribute to that ſcope, and whatever marreth that, though it ſhould not be work ſtrictly, but idleneſs, carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or playing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gaming, and ſporting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet its a breach of this reſt: for 1. That is no religious duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor 2. tending as a neceſſary help to it; nor 3. is reſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that we ſhould pley in it, but that we ſhould ſanctifie it; and 4. playing or ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cannot be called ſanctifying the day; otherwayes we might have mo Sabbaths then one, and the prophaneſt would love them beſt; 5. playing ſeparateth not the Sabbath from other dayes, more then work doeth; for men play in all: 6. playing is neither a religious duty, it being amongſt the moſt irreligious and prophane; nor a duty of neceſſity for eaſing of wearineſs, which doth not here come by any bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toyl and labour, but (if there be any) from being exerciſed in ſpiritual duties; which, therefore, change and variety will through Gods bleſſing do, ſo as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be born out in them; nor is there any place for it, except ſome duty be neglected, therefore its inconſiſtent with this.</p>
               <p>We come to the ſecond way of conſidering the ſanctification required here, and that is by comparing it with that ſtrictneſs called for from the Jews, and to which they were tyed.</p>
               <p>We ſpeak not here of Ceremonials (for ſo their whole ſervice might be more burdenſome then ours, and particularly their Sabbath-ſervices, becauſe they were doubled on that day) but of moral duties; and in that reſpect we ſay, that the tye and obligation unto the ſanctification of this day is equal and alike unto us with them, which is clear in particulars, for 1. It tyeth us now to as long time, to wit, a natural day of twenty four hours, as it did them then. 2. It reſtraineth from work and requireth holy reſt now, as much as then; for whatever work then ſtruck againſt the Letter or purpoſe and ſcope of the Command, and marred holy duties, doth ſo ſtill. 3. It requireth poſitive ſanctification by holy duties, as preaching, prayer, meditation, &amp;c. and alloweth not idleneſs, nor indulgeth time to other
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:31633:104"/>
unneceſſary works. 4. It requireth as ſpiritual a manner and as ſpiritual a frame in performing of them now as then.</p>
               <p>For 1. If the Command be moral, then is there no change in moral duties, for it is the ſame Command to us, that it was to them, ſave in ceremonial things: 2. If the ſame things were allowed to them which are allowed to us, and if no more be allowed to be done by us, then was allowed to be done by them on the Sabbath, then the obſervation in its ſtrictneſs is equal, but the firſt is true, for works of piety, mercy and neceſſity, are allowed to us, and ſo were they to them, as by Chriſts reaſoning againſt them (as being here ſuperſtitious) may appear: yea, 3. our allowances are taken from the practiſe of Chriſt, and his reaſonings with the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, who in theſe diſputes aimed not to ſhew that more was lawful by his coming then was before, but to ſhew what then was lawful, though they ignorantly or wilfully miſunderſtood the Command, for even then God allowed mercy rather then ſacrifice, &amp;c. which places moſt clearly warrant us in our practiſe. 4. The Service we have now is as ſpiritual, and without all doubt the promiſe of the ſpirit, for keeping up in holy duties as large as formerly, and therefore our improving of it ſhould be no leſs.</p>
               <p>Before we proceed, there are ſome Scriptures which ſeem to thwart with, and to be croſs to this, to which we would ſpeak a little for clearing of them; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 23, 29. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 3. where it would ſeem that going out of the place dreſſing of meat, and kindling of fire were forbidden, which are allowed to us: To which we ſay. 1. That we ſpeak of the meaning of this fourth Command, if any more was forbidden them by peculiar judicial Laws, that contradicteth not our aſſertion, theſe may be abrogated, while this command ſtandeth. But 2, We conceive that as to theſe things, gathering of ſticks, kindling of fire, dreſſing meat, &amp;c. no more is allowed unto us then unto them, that is, all unneceſſary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in, and about, theſe is unlawful to us now, and all neceſſary labour in, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, them was allowed unto, and lawful for them; as may be gathered from Chriſts practiſe, and his reaſoning with the Jews, and from the allowance which was to their Beaſts. In the third place then, we ſay that theſe Scriptures cannot be literally and univerſally underſtood, for it cannot be thought that they went not out of the place, kindled no fire, dreſſed no meat in any caſe; yea, the allowance for their neceſſity, and Chriſts going in and partaking, when invited on the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. Its like to ſomewhat that was prepared that day, with his defending of his Diſciples practiſe in plucking ears of Corn, and rubbing them, as it is <hi>Luke</hi> 6, 1. (which was a ſort of preparing and dreſſing of that meat) inſinuate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; neither can any thing be gathered from that place; <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 23. againſt dreſſing of meat ſimply, but rather the contrary, for the <hi>Manna</hi> that remained over what was dreſſed on the ſixth day, was to be laid up till the ſeventh day, or the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, but not till the day after the Sabbath; and will it not ſuppoſe, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved then to dreſs it on the Sabbath as on other dayes by boyling, at leaſt, for as to grinding of it at Mills, or other wayes, there was no neceſſity for that on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath out of ſome extraordinary Caſe (or elſe they had needleſly laid it up) and ſo behoved to have fires to dreſs it with: And therefore that of not dreſſing meat, of not kindling fire, &amp;c. muſt be of what is unneceſſary and for ſervile works, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king gain in mens ordinary particular callings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:31633:105"/>
But to the third way, if any ſhould inquire what more holineſs is called for, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> can be win at, on the Sabbath then a Believer is called unto on other dayes, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to endeavour to be perfectly holy every day? <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> Although he be called to be perfectly holy, yet not in the holineſs of immediate Worſhip throughout every day: He is to be perfectly holy on other dayes, according to the duties and imployments of theſe dayes; but on the Lords day he is called to be holy according to the imployments of that day and its duties; The Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of old were indeed called to perfect holineſs all the week over, but ſingularly to ſanctifie the Sabbath as a part of their univerſal holineſs. 2. Though all the parts of every day ſhould be ſpent holily, yet ſome parts more eſpecially, as what parts are ſpent in Prayer, reading the Scripture, &amp;c. and ſomewhat more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are called to it on a Faſting day, then on other dayes, even ſo on the Sabbath. 3. There is a difference betwixt a perſon living holily in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and a perſon who is holy in ſanctifying the <hi>Lords day,</hi> though a man ſhould be holy every day, yet is he not to ſanctifie every day which is required on this day, whereof we ſhall now ſpeak.</p>
               <p>This dayes ſanctification then, we conceive to conſiſt in theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is more abſtractedneſs not onely from ſinful things, but even from lawful temporal things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> required on that day then on other days, a ſpiritual frame of heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeparating and ſetting apart a man from ordinary thoughts; Hence we may ſay, that as the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifyeth unclean as well as common, ſo a common or every day frame o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Spirit, will be found unclean for the Sabbath; there muſt therefore be another frame of heart, different from an ilk a day-frame and ſuited to that day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This day is to be ſanctifyed in reſpect of the Exerciſes of it beyond other days, and that neceſſarily; whereas on ſome other dayes we may be taken up in ſome duties of worſhip arbitrarily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but here neceſſarily; And men may, and ought, to be holy on other dayes, in their plowing, and other works, but there their Holineſs is to be in immediate worſhip to God, in ſome thing relating to that alway, ſuch as praying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hearing, conferring, meditating, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſanctification of this day lyeth in this, that it muſt be wholly ſanctified, but parts of other dayes are ordinarily uſed in religious Service, but this whole day is to be uſed ſo, a man ſhould be this whole day throughout, as in the time of praying on other dayes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Duties would be multiplyed that day, more ſecret and private Prayer, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp;c. and more publick Worſhip; even as there were double Sacrifices that day under the Law, though there were Sacrifices all dayes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There would be in the duties of this day more intenſeneſs of Spirit, and a further degree of ſpiritual affections, then in theſe duties of other dayes; becauſe this day is purpoſely ſet apart for that end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by continuance in duties we may attain to more of a ſpiritual frame, and becauſe not onely the Exerciſes of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, praying, reading and hearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. call to Holineſs on this day, as they do on other dayes, but even the very day it ſelf doth call to it; even as on a ſolemn day of humiliation men ought to be more affected and deeply humbled then on other dayes (though daily they ſhould repent and be humbled) becauſe that day is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſet apart for it; ſo ought our worſhip to be more intenſe and ſolemn this day
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:31633:105"/>
ſuitable unto it, wherein we are, as it were, dyeted for inſiſting and perſiſting in duties of worſhip; where as theſe duties in this reſpect, and in compariſon, are on other days, but as ſtarts, worſhip is here ſome way the only work of that day.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There would be more heavenlineſs and ſpiritual ſence breathed after that day in the frame of the heart; it would be near God, and the work of the day would be delightſome and ſweet, the Sabbath would, as it is <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 58. be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a delight, and we would endeavour as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. to enter into his reſt, to paſs through the outward reſt into his, to be within his chambers, yea even in his arms, as it were, all that day.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There would be that day more divineneſs in our Holineſs (to ſpeak ſo) a ſort of Majeſty by ordinary in our walk, looking like the Sabbath, and like the God of the Sabbath: There would be an exulting in God that day, we would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to have our hearts in a ſpecial manner warm in the Exerciſe of love to him, and to be much in praiſing of him; our Whole worſhip would more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and immediately be aimed and levelled at the honour and glory of God, as the end of it, then on other ordinary days, wherein our prayers and other pieces of worſhip may more immediately reſpect our own Caſe and need<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but on this day Gods Honour as the end more immediately whatever our own Caſe be, and that both in heart within and in the nature of our Exerciſes without; this is to call the Sabbath of the Lord <hi>honourable,</hi> to honour and glorifie him, therein as it is <hi>Iſ,</hi> 58. a ſpecial Majeſty being in that days worſhip by levealling it with extraordinary ſingleneſs at Gods praiſe, even as his name is hallowed or ſanctified in Heaven by Angels and perfected Saints. Hence <hi>It's good to give thanks unto thy Name,</hi> &amp;c. beginneth that Pſalm of Praiſe for the Sabbath-day, to wit, the 92. Theſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties then that further his praiſe are more eſpecially for that day.</p>
               <p n="8">8. All theſe reach both words and thoughts, nothing to the hindrance of theſe is to be admitted neither; there are none of our words and thoughts that day, but they would in a ſpecial manner be Gods, and in it we ſhould be ſpent as his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and endeavour to be within view of Heaven, to make ſome Eſſay of glorified Saints exerciſe there, and to have the Sabbath as a little preludy of that everlaſting Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath and reſt in the boſom of God.</p>
               <p>The Fourth way of conſidering this ſanctification is poſitively, to wit, as to the Duties, wherein the Sabbath is to be ſpent, which are ſhortly, all duties of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate worſhip, whether they be inward, as meditation, ſelf-examination, heart prayer, either ejaculatory or more continued, heart-ſorrow for ſins, &amp;c. or outward, as vocal prayer and ſinging of Pſalms, reading the Scriptures and other pious Books, hearing the word, &amp;c. or whether they ſecret which may be both inward and outward, or private in Families, as reading of the word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring on it, repeating Sermons, praying together, &amp;c. or publick; as joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Congregation in prayers and praiſes, hearing the word read, and the ſenſe given, hearing of Sermons, participating of the Sacraments, when diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, joyning in ſolemn humiliations and thanks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>givings, when they fall neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or more conveniently to be on the Sabbath; All which and ſuch like are proper duties for that day; to which liberal laying up, and giving for the relief of the poor according to ability, and as God bleſſeth every man would be added as a ſuitable
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:31633:106"/>
dnty of it, though it be no duty of immediate worſhip.</p>
               <p>The fifth way is to conſider the ſanctification of the Sabbath complexly, before it come, when it's come, and after it's paſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then the night before (not ſecluding a ſuitable remembrance throughout the week) remember it 1. by timous leaving of worldly buſineſs, it's a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment on the Sabbath, thought too too uſual to continue longer at work the night before, then any other night of the week, as if folks would gain the day of reſt, out of Saturnſdays night and Mondays morning.</p>
               <p n="2">2 By not ſuffering this little times leaving of work, to be idly ſpent but being taken up with endeavours, 1. To abſtract mind the 2. To from other works as well as the hand, and to have the heart put in a lively frame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mind the work of the day which is coming, and to have a ſuitablenſs to it. If ye ask what ſuitableneſs we have to it? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Endeavour 1. to be as if ye were about to meet God, to tryſt, as if it were, viſibly with him, and ſolemnly to treat and enter in marriage with him. 2. To be like Heaven, and in a ſpecial manner in ſome ſort to imitate God, as if ye were already entered into his reſt, and had reſted from your own works. 3. To be as if ye were to dye, and to ſtep into Eternity, for this reſting ſhould mind us of that, and was, and is ſtill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appointed (though yet no Ceremony) to mind us of Gods ſeparating of us from others for himſelf, that we may reſt eternally with him.</p>
               <p>Then 3. for furthering of this, look back on the Week paſt, and endeavour to have things clear before the Sabbath come, and all by-gone quarrels removed, that theremay be no ſtanding controverſies againſt you to begin the Sabbath with.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Pray with ſpecial ſolemn ſeriouſneſs in reference to that day, that ye may have peace for what is paſt, that ye may be in a right frame for the day; that the Miniſter may be helped to ſpeak as it becometh; that others may be fitted to heare and joyn; that the Word and other Ordinances may be richly bleſt of God; and that the mercy of having the Ordinances may be minded, with praiſe to the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous giver of them, and ſuitably improved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the morning of that ſweet and deſirable day cometh (after we have fallen aſleep in a ſpecial manner, as it were in the Lords arms, the night before and left our ſelves there) 1. we would timely begin the work and beware that either carnal thoughts get in, or the time be idly ſlepped over, but I ſay we would begine the work early; for it's for that end appointed, and ſinful thoughts will not be kept out, but by filling the room otherwayes with what is ſpiritualy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably. <hi>Shew forth Gods loving kindneſs in the morning,</hi> ſaith the Pſam for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, to wit, the 92. Let therefore the Meditation of ſomewhat of theſe, or ſuch like, begin with us, even when we are making ready, 1. ſomewhat of God himſelf, whoſe day it is; 2. of heaven, and that happineſs that is there; 3. of the works of God, who gave us and all the world a being, and who only preſerveth the ſame; 4. of Chriſts redemption, and as cloſed and perfected on this day; which eſpecially ſhould be minded; that ſo thinking of our many and great obligations, and of the miſery we had been in, had not that work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption intervened, we may begin the day with a due impreſſion of Gods great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs: of our own ſinfulneſs, weakneſs, and miſery; and of this bleſſed remedy and out-gate.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:31633:106"/>
2. We would addreſs our ſelves to ſolemn prayer in ſecret, and that at greater length then on other dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with perſiſting in, inwith ſpecial petitions relating to the day, with all the ſeriouſneſe may win it.</p>
               <p n="3">3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We would take a view of our own hearts, to ſee how and where we left the night before, and endeavour to have clearneſs betwixt the Lord and us as to our ſtate, and otherwayes maintained; and renewed if it was; or attained if it was not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Too much time would not be ſpent in adorning of busking or folks bodies, or in making other proviſions for them, but as the whole of it would be taken up in duties of worſhip (as we have before ſhewed) ſo ſome part of it would be ſet apart for ſecret reading, yea, for ſecret praiſing, thankſgiving, and ſinging, an exerciſe not unbecoming that day, as that fore-cited Pſalm for the Sabbath day, ſheweth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If thou be the Head of a Family, or liveſt in fellowſhip with others, then the family is gravely to be brought together, and every particular member is to joyn with the reſt: And here alſo prayers and other religious duties are to be doubled according to the ceremonial doubling of Sacrifices on the Seventh-day-Sabbath under the Law; for in ſecret, in families, and in publick, there would be more that day then in other dayes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Care and inſpection would be taken ſo far as men can reach, that by none in the Society, neither ſecret nor private duties be neglected, nor publick duties abſtained from, but that each may ſtir up one another, and more eſpecially thoſe whoſe places lead them to it, to the ſutable ſanctification of the day in all the duties of it, and withal, it would be looked to, that none of the family be ſuffered to ſtay at home unneceſſarily from the publick worſhip or to be abſent from the family worſhip.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Timely (that ye be not by haſte diſcompoſed) come to publick-modeſtly apparrelled (it's a ſhame to ſee how gaudily ſome come to publick worſhip on the Lords day) grave in your walk wary and circumſpect in you words, that they be ſpiritually edifying and ſutable; watch over your eyes, that carnal or wordly looks ſteal you not away, nor diſtemper your hearts; but eſpecially over your hearts, that they we are not out of a ſpiritual frame.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When ye come to the place of publick worſhip, if it be a while a beginning, be ſtill watchful, and the nearer ye come to it the more watchful; for temptations will be very ready to divert or diſcompoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there would be a frequent intermixture of ejaculatory prayers in reference to every thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> equiſite for attaining and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this compoſedneſs.</p>
               <p n="9">9. When publick worſhip beginneth, ſtudy to be (as <hi>Cornelious</hi> was, <hi>Acts</hi> 10) preſent to joyn in prayer, and praiſe, to hear what God will ſay, to receive it, to lay it up in your hearts, to be ſutably affected with it, and to reſolve through grace to practiſe it; <hi>(for bleſſed are they only who hear the word and do it):</hi> and this would be with delight, aming aright at the end of the Ordinances, whatever they be, whereof we ſpoke ſomewhat on the ſecond Comandment.</p>
               <p n="10">10. When the publick worſhip is as to it's firſt diet cloſed, let not your minds turn carnal, but depart reverently from it, chearing your ſelves in God, fixing the convictions, exhortations, directions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſtructions, &amp;c. in your mind, as ye have met with them, and be ruminating rather on theſe, then beginning to

               <p n="11">11. As ſoon as ye can win, go in ſecret and ſeek to have theſe things faſtned and riveted betwixt, God and you, and let that be your firſt work, and let the little time that interveneth betwixt the diets of publick worſhip till you return, be ſpent ſutably to the day and the end of the duties thereof.</p>
               <p n="12">12. When all the publick worſhip is ended then ye would do according to the preceding tenth Direction; ye would withal retire a while in ſecret, and reflect on your carriage in publick, and alſo ſee what good may be gotten of the day, and if there be any miſſes, neglects, or failings obſerved (as if there be a diligent ſearch there will no doubt be) then be humbled, ſeek pardon through Chriſt, and reſolve through grace to help theſe afterward; conſider what was ſaid, and like the noble <hi>Bereans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Acts</hi> 17. put it to the tryal for your confirmation, by your conſidering and examining the Scriptures cited or ſpoken of; and endeavour yet more to have your hearts affected in ſecret with them.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Then call your Families and come together after ſecret ſeeking of God, and 1. be inquiring of one another what is remembred, that all being put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ye may be helpful by your memories one to another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. ye would do this, not as if it were enough to tell over the words, but that the Doctrines and their Uſes may be fixed, and ye affected with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore 3. ye would do this with other duties of reading, ſinging, and ſpiritual conference, as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it ſhal offer, with prayer to God before and after, being thus exerciſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ill ye go again in ſecret to cloſe the day as ye began.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Duties of Charity would be done, contributions made liberally according to our ability, and relief ſent to others as we know their need<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which alſo would be inquired after.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Indeavoure to have the heart in a right frame to cloſe the day with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on our carriage throughout it, fearing to lye down with guilt unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and without ſome ſpecial fruit of the duties of the day; haſt not to go to reſt ſooner that night then on other nights, on deſign that you may be ſooner at work the nixt day; which ſmelleth ſtrong of wearying of the Sabbath, and of longing to have it at an end, of which the Lord complained of old, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5. ſtudy to lye down with thoughts as you aroſe, leaving your ſelves in his arms, with reſpect to the eternal Sabbath that is coming.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the Sabbath is paſt, and the next day cometh, caſt not by all thoughts of it inſtantly, but begin your work as having juſt now ended the Sabbath, fearing to let the reliſh of it wear away; and indeavouring in your carriage through the Week to retain the ſtamp and impreſſion of it; eſpecially beware to go to your Callings with a Sabbath dayes guiltineſs on you; O indeavour by all means to have that removed hand all the Week through have one eye to the Sabbath paſt; and another to the Sabbath coming, having ſtill that ſounding in your ears, <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Sabbath,</hi> or <hi>the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>day, to keep it holy;</hi> dieting your ſouls, as it were, all along the Week, for a courſe of communion with God in the duties of the next Sabbath.</p>
               <p>It will be now eaſie to know when this command is tranſgreſſed (which was the ſixth way propoſed of conſidering the ſanctification of the Sabbath to wit, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitively or negatively) which is done 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by committing any thing contrary
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:31633:107"/>
to the <hi>rest</hi> or ſanctification of it; 2. by omitting any of the things which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the right ſanctifying of it; 3. by an unſuitable frame of heart as to the due manner of performing any of theſe duties required<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>We will find the weight of this command yet more fully, by conſidering it's reaſons how it'sexplicated and preſſed: This is done 1. by laying down the equity and extent of it. <hi>v.</hi> 9. 10. 2. by preſſing it from God's example.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour and do all thy work:</hi> Theſe words may be looked on 1. As an obliging conceſſion, which is indeed very liberal; as if the Lord had ſaid, all dayes are mine, yet I have given thee Six to do all thy work and labour that thou haſt to do, therefore give me the Seventh. It is but a ſmall retribution for Six to return a Seventh. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As a reſtriction, thou ſhalt do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever work thou haſt to do within the Six dayes, but none of it on the Seventh. 3. As a command whereby God diſtributeth our time, and commandeth Six for our work, and the Seventh for his: And thus theſe words forbid idleneſs, and command lawful diligence in theſe Six dayes; which we conceive here to be implyed.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Becauſe God is not carving out what time we may be idle in, but what time we ſhould imploy in our own lawful works as well as in his; for it cannot be thought that he giveth us Six to be idle on; It muſt therefore be to work on ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as our life ſhould be taken up in doing either what more immediately concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our ſelves, or what more immediatly concerneth God; ſo the ſcope of this command being to proportion our time betwixt theſe two, what is allowed for either of them, muſt imply an improving of it for that very end. 2 The oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition alſo will confirm this; Theſe Six dayes are to be applyed to our work, as the Seventh is to be applyed to Gods, which is more then a permiſſion, and if the negative part be imperative, <hi>in it thou ſhalt not work,</hi> then the poſitive, <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou work,</hi> may well be underſtood ſo alſo. 3. Gods example will preſs it for we are to follow it, not only in reſting on the Seventh, but alſo in working in the Six dayes as he did. 4. Working theſe Six dayes cometh in as a mean to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and fit for the ſanctification of the Seventh, for ſo a man putteth by his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and has the more freedom for the <hi>reſt</hi> on the Seventh, whereas idlenſe often ſinfull neceſſitateth to the breach of it, and to a deſire that it may be gone, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5. And thus idleneſs is reproved here, and diligence commanded under one conſideration, to wit, as the remove of the former and practiſe of the later do capacitate us to give God his due on his own day when it cometh: Even as they are alſo included in the eight Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt not steal;</hi> for as idleneſs becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a ſnare and temptation to a man to ſteal, and hindereth him from works of Charity and ſuitable diligence in the works of his lawful Calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> readily prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the one, and capactiateth for the other; So is it here, for it's not unuſual that the ſame ſin and duty may be forbidden and commanded in diverſe commands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diuerſe conſiderations; And this agreeth well both with the words and ſcope of this command. And 5. according to the holy and wiſe oeconomy of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, our labour may be commanded to mak his reſt to be to us the more reliſhing and refreſhing.</p>
               <p>The tenth Verſe containeth three things for explication, 1. The Lords claim of the Seventh day, as having reſerved that to himſelf, it's his, it's to him, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:31633:108"/>
by him &amp; for him ſeparated from other dayes. 2. Aconſequent flowing from this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore that day is not to be imployed to any of our own works, no not the leaſt, <hi>No manner of work,</hi> no word, no thought nor deed of any ſuch ſort under what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever pretext beſide the excepted caſes. 3. It's extenſion as to all relations, ſo to all ranks, Parent and Child, Maſter and Servant, &amp;c. yea, it's <hi>thou</hi> for thy ſelf, and for all thou haſt the overſight and charge of, Sons, Servants, Strangers, yea, and Beaſts, not that they are capable of ſanctifying a day more then the Beaſts in <hi>Nineveh</hi> were of religious faſting, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3. yet this ſheweth what ought to be the Maſters care, it being for his uſe that Beaſts are put to work; God injoyneth all wayes of abſtaining from every thing that is a mans own work on the Sabbath, and will have him ſolemn in it: In a word, <hi>All within thy gates,</hi> looketh not only to Maſters and all in their families or within their doors, but to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Governours, and all within their Juriſdiction (Gates being the place of Judgment, &amp; uſed in Scripture to ſhew the extent as well as ſeat of power) that they ſhould ſee to their ſanctifying of this day; and the falling of any under them is their ſin when they endeavour not to prevent and amend it: And thus <hi>Nehemiah</hi> underſtood this command, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. when he put forth his power, not only in contending with the native Nobles, but even againſt Strangers, for reſtraining them from violating this day.</p>
               <p>Hence we gather 1 That idleneſs is a ſin, and that they will hardly give God his due on the Seventh day; who are not diligent in the duties of ſome lawful call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtation for Gods honour and others good through the Six dayes of the Week; and indeed this is often ſeen, that ſuch are lazie, and careleſs, and idle on that day, paſſing it over even as they do other dayes, without any difference at all, except it be that they come to Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We gather that humane, whether Eccleſiaſtick or Civil appointment of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary fixed days for worſhip throughout the whole day, beſide the Sabbath, will not agree with this command allowing men ſix for labour. It's true, God might Soveraignly limit men, but where he hath given liberty (if it were but by conceſſion) who can reſtrain?</p>
               <p>Concerning dayes therefore, we lay down theſe four: 1. That there can be no ſolemn! ſeeting apart of any day to any creature; thus Saints dayes are unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: for the Sabbath or day of <hi>reſt</hi> is to the Lord, and to none other, it being a peculiar piece of worſhip to him who hath divided time betwixt his worſhip and our work. And although men ſhould keep the day, and alter the worſhip, yet this is a taking of that which was once abuſed, and never enjoyned, for to apply it to God, and wanteth not offence; even as the retaining of other things in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which have been abuſed, and are not neceſſary, is offenſive. 2. No man can inſtitute any day, even to the true God, as apart of worſhip, ſo as to bind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to it, or to equal it with this day: That is apart of Gods royal prerogative, and a thing peculiar to him to ſanctifie and bleſs a day. 3. Even thoſe dayes which are pretended to be ſet apart to and for God, and yet not as apart of worſhip, cannot be impoſed in a conſtant and ordinary way (as Anniverſary dayes and feaſts are) becauſe by an ordinary rule God hath given to man Six dayes for work, except in extrordinary caſes he ſhall pleaſe to call for ſome part of them again. 4. Yet extrordinarily upon occaſions of Humiliation, or of Joy, and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:31633:108"/>
dayes, for that time, may be ſet apart for God, without wronging this conceſſion, even as in extrordinary times we may work, and not reſt on the Sabbath day, though ordinarily we may not: This proportioning of time therefore is for the ordinary rule, but yet admitteth of the exception of extraordinary caſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We gather that Maſters and Parents ought to have a ſpecial overſight of their own Children and Families in the worſhipping of God, and that eſpecially in reference to the ſanctifying of this day; and that there is a ſpecial communion in worſhipping of God amongſt the ſeveral relations of a Family.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We gather that Magiſtrates, and all who have power over others, ought to ſee to the reſtraining of Vice, and to the performing of outward duties, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſuch as relate to the ſanctification of the Sabbath (as well as to abſtain from, and to do ſuch and ſuch things themſelves in their own perſons) in and by theſe over whom they have power; and that it's no leſs ſcandalous and ſinful for a Magiſtrate not to ſee that ſin he cruſhed that the Sabbath be ſanctified, and the Ordinances of Religion be entertained and received and reverenced in and by thoſe over whom he hath charge, then if he committed ſuch ſins himſelf, then if he diſcountenanced the Ordinances and break the Sabbath himſelf, or ſufferred his own family or himſelf to be without the worſhip of God: Why? becauſe theſe are within <hi>his gates,</hi> and he is to account for them: He is to rule for God, and their good which is mainly ſpiritual; he is to be a terrour to evil doers, as well as to be an incouragement to them that do well; and men are according to their places and parts to be forth-coming for God and the good of others. And yet this cannot be called a conſtraining or forcing of Conſciences, for a Magiſtrate or Maſter thus to reſtrain theſe who are under them; it's but the uſing of that power, which God hath committed to them to make men to do their duty, and to abſtain from diſhonouring God, and the puniſhing of them, if they do other wayes; in which reſpect he beareth not the Sword in vain.</p>
               <p>The 2. and main reaſon followeth, <hi>v.</hi> 11. wherein this command is three ways preſſed alſo, 1. By Gods example, who during the ſpace of ſix days wrought (though he might as eaſily have made all in one day) and reſted the Seventh, and not before the Seventh, on which he wrought none; even ſo it becometh men to do, ſeeing he intended this for their imitation, and for that end doth propoſe it here: Gods reſt on the Seventh is not abſolute and in every reſpect (for <hi>John</hi> 5. 17. he worketh hitherto, that is, in the works of Providence, ſuſtaining, preſerving, and governing the Creatures made by him, and their Actions) but all things needful for the perfecting of the world were then made and finiſhed. (Whence by the way we may gather, that not only all Creatures were made, Angels even theſe that ſince turned Devils, &amp;c. but that they were made within the Six days of Creation, when Heaven, Earth, Sea, and all that was in them was made) Therefore all our works that are neceſſary to be done in the ſix working days, would be done and ended, that we may reſt on the Sabbath as he did.</p>
               <p>The 2. way is by his bleſſing of it. <hi>God bleſſed the Sabbath day,</hi> which is to be underſtood not ſimply in reſpect of the day, which is not properly capable of bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but in reſpect of the true obſervers of it, he bleſſeth it to them and he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them in it, which may be in theſe three: 1. That the reſt of that day ſhal not
<pb facs="tcp:31633:109"/>

That the Lord hath ſet a part that, day for a Spiritual bleſſing, and the Communication of it to his people (ſo the Bread and Wine are bleſſed in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to be a mean of conveying Spiritual bleſſings to the worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 3. That God will abundantly manifeſt his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence, and multiply his ſpiritual bleſſings that day upon it's due obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, more then on other days wherein he is alſo ſought; as there is this day a double worſhip both in reſpect of the Duty, and of the day whereon it's done ſo there ſhall be a double bleſſing beyond what is on other days; in which reſpect, even prayers in, and towards, the Temple (while it ſtood by divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a ſeparate place from others) had a bleſſing beyond prayers in other places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thus Chriſt bleſſed the loaves and the few ſmall fiſhes, <hi>John</hi> 6. when he made them by multiplication on the matter to feed far beyond their ordinary proportionableneſs; ſo ſervice on this day groweth in it's bleſſing; hence we may ſee an uſual connexion betwixt <hi>Univerſal</hi> thriving in Religion, Grace and Piety, and ſuitable obedience to this command, in the tender ſanctification of the Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and withall a reaſon, why ſo few make progreſs in godlineſs, even little keeping holy the Sabbath as they ought.</p>

               <p>If it be asked here, why God will have a day ſet apart for holy Exerciſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide other days? It may be anſwered, 1. It's meet that God be acknowledged Lord of our time, by this Tribut being reſerved to himſelf. 2. Becauſe men having but a finite underſtanding, beſide the now corruption of it, connot be intenſely taken up with ſpiritual and heavenly things and with temporal and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, both at once, or at the ſame inſtant; for even <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency could not do that, therefore the Lord hath graciouſly ſet apart a day for mans help in that. 3. It's to teach man that his chief end is to converſe with God, and to live with him, and that he ought to cary in his own affairs along the week, and order things ſo as the Sabbath may be duly ſanctified, when it ſhal come in that ſweet ſoul repoſing converſe with him. 4. To ſhew man wherein his happineſs conſiſteth, it's even in this, to walk and converſe with God, and to be in his worſhip; this is his reſt. 5. To ſhew the excellency of Religion, and of the Works of Piety, or of Gods Worſhip, above mens Employments in earthly and wordly things: It was a Sabbath to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency to be abſtracted from his labour for the worſhip of God; the one is mens toyl, the other is mens ſpiritual reſt and eaſe, far contrary to that which men in the world ordinarily think and judge.</p>

We ſee now how great and grievous a ſin it is to break this command, and with what care this day ſhould be hallowed.</p>
               <p>For 1. It's a Command of the firſt Table, and ſo the breach of it is, in ſome reſpect, more then murther, Adultery, Stealing, &amp;c, it's included in the firſt and great Commandement,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Amongſt all the commands of the firſt Table, yea all the commands, this religious obſervance of the Sabbath, is moſt forcibly preſſed with more reaſons, and with more full and particular explication: Becauſe 1. All the commands hang ſome way on this; and obedience is ordinarily given to them with the ſame readineſs, as this day is employed in Gods Service, 2. It keepeth life, as it were, in all the reſt, and when men are cold in this, ſo are they in all the reſt. 3. This tryeth men in theirlove to God beſt; If indeed his company and ſervice be more delighted in thenthe World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And is a notable indication of the frame of the ſoul; it maketh proof both of their ſtate and frame, as men are uſually and habitually on the Sabbath, ſo in effect are they, as to theſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No breach of any command hath more aggravations; for 1. It is againſt reaſon and equity, when God hath given us ſo many and ſo good reaſons for it. 2. It's high Ingratitude, the Sabbath being a Mercy; and a great Mercy indeed it is to be priviledged with acceſs to converſe with God a whole day of every week in duties of worſhip. 3. It's againſt Love, God's Love hath inſtituted it, and our Love ſhould in a ſpecial manner vent it ſelf to him on it. 4. It's cruelty againſt our ſelves; for the Sabbath kept holy, is backed with the promiſe of of a ſpecial bleſſing, and we by this ſin prejudge our ſelves of that; yea the Sabbath rightly ſpent is a mean both of holineſs and of nearneſs to God, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to him and of communion with him, it promoteth both: So that it is eminently verified here, that theſe who ſin againſt this command, ſin againſt, and <hi>forſake their own Mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. No ſin doth more evidence univerſal untenderneſs; and as it's a ſin in it ſelf, ſo it evidenceth, eſpecially when groſs, a very ſinful and ſome way Atheiſtical frame and diſpoſition, as may be gathered from <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea.</hi> 5. It occaſioneth and breedeth other ſins: it habituateth to ſinning, and hardneth againſt challenges, ſo that men ordinarily become very groſs and looſe and fall in ſcandalous ſins, who neglect the ſanctification of the Sabbath, which is the quickner and fomenter ſome way of all duties and knitteth the two Tables of the Law together; hence it cometh to paſs, that we often hear men that have turned to be very looſe, groſs and ſcandalous (and ſome of them on Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds and at Gibbets) cry out of Sabbath breaking, imputing the one to the other, as a main cauſe; for by this ſin men grow ſtout againſt challenges, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in ſecret duties, and ſo at length ſit quite up.</p>
               <p n="6">6 No ſin hath more ſharp challenges for it, and more ſad Judgements aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, then ſins againſt this command; have there been any men deeply challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſin, or at death (whether ordinary or violent) brought to expreſs and utter their challenges, but ſins againſt this command have been main ones? The ſlighting of the Lords Sabbath made <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be burnt with fire <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. laſt; for this ſin they are threatned with terrible plagues; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20, 21. 24. not only in

                  </gap>. 23. but with ſpiritual plagues to which they are given up, <hi>v.</hi> 25. 26. You know that a man was ſtoned for gathering of ſticks on the Sabbath, <hi>Num.</hi> 15. ſee alſo, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 28. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 8. where the Lord accounteth Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking a refuſing to keep his Commandements and Laws, and a deſpiſſing of his holy things; O is it poſſible, that a man can be well that breaketh the Sabbath, or to whom it is not a delight?</p>
               <p>If any ſhould ask here, if indeed the breaches of this command be greater ſins then the breaches of the commands of the ſecond Table? and if ſo, if God will be aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on theſe ſeverely?</p>
               <p>For Anſwer (premitting this one word, that in comparing breaches of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the two Tables, we would compare ſins of a like nature together, that is, ſins of preſumption with ſins of preſumption, and ſins of infirmity with ſins of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity) we ſay, that a preſumptuous ſin againſt the fourth Command, if it were but to go unneceſſarily to the door, or to gather ſticks, is a greater ſin then a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous murther, becauſe it ſtriketh more immediately againſt God: And that a ſin of infirmity againſt the fourth command, is greater then a ſin of Infirmity againſt the ſixth. Yet we grant that preſumptuous Murther is a greater ſin then a ſin of in firmity againſt the fourth command, becauſe preſumption and high handedneſs in the manner of ſinning, in a ſin little on the matter comparatively, da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eth God, as it were, and ſtriketh immediately againſt him, and ſo is an additional high aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it; beſide What it is in the nature of it: And though our cenſures againſt preſumptuous breaches of the Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are now as great ſins as formerly (as is clear from what is juſt now ſaid) be often more mitigated now under the Goſpel, neither was it as we conceive, ordinary to ſtone the preſumptuous prophaneners of the Sabbath, even amongſt the Jews; yet will this be no good reaſoning; men do not now execute punishments upon Tranſgreſſours of the firſt Table as on Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours of the ſecond, therefore Tranſgreſſions of the ſecond Table are greater ſins then Tranſgreſſions of the commands of the firſt; for ſo we would be in hazard to poſtpone all the Laws or Commands of the firſt Table to theſe of the ſecond; but we are to conſider that temporal punishments are heightened or leſſened according as the peace and order of civil Societies may be more or leſs therein concerned, ſo that it is not by theſe meaſures that we are to make the eſtimate of the greatneſs or ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins in the ſight of God, and in order to his righteous and abſolute judgments, and therefore it`s enough that we enquire what God hath done, and will do, and what ſinners may expect from him; however men may over-look and paſs them by, yet before God they are often taken notice of, and plagued even in this life, and will be for ever hereafter, if they repent not.</p>
               <p>We may now therefore in the cloſe, exhort, beſeech, obteſt and charge you all, as in the ſight of God, who is a ſevere avenger of them, that ye would be aware of the ſins whereby this command is tranſgreſſed: Particularly guard againſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not preparing for it, or not remembring of it; many prophane the Sabbath, ere they come to publick, yea, before it come, in ſome reſpect.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Carnal thoughts and a common frame of heart, yea, even to ſpeak ſo, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular frame that looketh but to our own condition or caſe; As not ſtirring it ſelf to be over and above that, to be affected with God and his glorious works of Creation and Redemption, to give him praiſe for his marvellous goodneſs on that day; there is alaſs generally little delight and praiſe in his worship, even on his own holy day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. General unedifying diſcourſes, of the news of the time, of health, and other things not neceſſary to that day.</p>

                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:31633:110"/>
4. Little profiting under the Goſpel, and not growing in knowledge and practiſe; many a Sabbath is thus prophaned, few getting or ſeeking the bleſſing of it, or on it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Going to the fields and viſiting of Neighbours to put off a piece of time, that ſo much time may be ſaved on other dayes of the Week, wherein many men think they have more to do; and not ſeeking to edifie, or to be edified when they viſit. Certainly by this going abroad and runing up and down the ſtreets unneceſſarily, ye indiſpoſe your ſelves, ye offend others, and tempt them to follow you, ye ſlight either duties in your families, or in ſecret, or it may be both, in a great meaſure; I ſuppoſe that if ye made conſcience of theſe, there would not be ſo much time to go abroad; Take ſome other day for recreating your ſelves; If ye ſay, ye have then ſomewhat elſe to do: And have ye nothing to do this day? Or wil ye take more boldly from Gods day, then from your own? Is Sacriledge leſs then taking what is your own? What if all did ſo gad abroad? (And it may be they have no leſs reaſon) What a Sabbath day would we have? There is a remarkable word, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 29. that on the Sabbath none might go out of his place, which though it be not to be underſtood as reſtraining exerciſes of piety, or works of neceſſity and mercy, as we shewed before; yet it would ſeem to be the meaning of the words, that on that which we call taking the air, and on viſiting, there was a reſtraint thereby intended.</p>

               <p n="8">8. Much idle loitering over of the Sabbath, doing nothing, and much ſleeping it over. Idleneſs is a ſin any day, much more on this day.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Little care of ſanctifying the Sabbath when men are from home, or when they are not in their own Congregations, when they are not in their own Houſes, or have not any to take overſight o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If any should ask remedies of all theſe, and ſuch like evils, I know none better then theſe that are in the Command it ſelf.</p>

Remember coming to Judgment, that ye may be found of it in peace as to this or any other guilt, and endeavour to prevent it: 3.

               <p>A ſecond is, be well imployed throughout the Week, and be not given to idleneſs or lazineſs in your particular Callings, nor in ſpiritual Exerciſes, there will be no ſanctifying of this day without that; be not therefore ſlothful in buſineſs, but fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11.</p>

               <p>OUR Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 37. ſumeth up the whole Law in theſe two words, which he calleth the two great Commandements, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind, and thy Neighbour as thy ſef,</hi> the two leggs that Piety in practiſe walketh upon; the one comprehendeth our duty to God, which runneth through all thee Ten Commands, but doth more eminently exert it ſelf in the firſt Four, whereof we have ſpoken: The other containeth our duty to our Neighbour; which is ſet down more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the laſt Six Commands, whereof we are now to ſpeak; and how eye, many do ignorantly and wickedly look on duty to man as ſomewhat extrinſick to Religion, and duty to God, yet both have the ſame authority, both are put in ohe ſum of the Law, both are written on Tables of Stone with the Lords own finger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and put within the Ark: And therefore we ought with a proportionable eare to inquire what God requireth of us as duty to others, as well as to himſelf: And we ſhould make no leſs conſcience of obedience to the one then to the other,</p>
               <p>Before we come particularly to the fifth Command, we ſhal ſpeak a little to theſe two, 1. Why love to God is called the firſt and great command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and love to our Neighbour the ſecond, and only like to the firſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 38. 2. why hath the Lord carved out mens duty to others as well as to himſelf.</p>
               <p>For the former of theſe, conſider in the firſt place that the commands of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table are equal to the commands of the firſt, in reſpect of the authority that injoyneth them, he that ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me,</hi> ſaith alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, &amp;c. Jam.</hi> 2. 11. In which reſpect it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 39. <hi>the ſecond is like unto this.</hi> 2. If we compare the two Tables together as to the matter contained in them, and the immediate object of each duty commanded; the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the firſt Table are greater, and the duties of the ſecond Table leſſer; the one relating more immediately, the other more mediately to Religion, in which reſpect they expreſs peculiarly our love to God, which is called the firſt and great
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:31633:111"/>
command; for the firſt four commands require that which in its own nature is worship, and is in an immediate way to be given to God; but the duites required in the other ſix, are not properly, formally and immediately called for as parts of worſhip to God, though, as they are acknoweledgments of him, they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially thereto referred.</p>
               <p>As to the 2. Why the Lord hath in ſo ſhort a ſum particularly ſet down our duty to others, as well as to himſelf and ſhewed how every one ſhould carry towards another; We would ſpeak to it the rather, that there are ſix commands in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, and but four in the firſt Table, and the Lords commending the duties of the ſecond Table hath ſaid, <hi>the ſecond is like unto the first,</hi> becauſe he would have it in our careful obſervance, going along with the firſt; And the Apoſtles as well as the Lord, in preſſing holineſs, do ordainarily inſtance in the duties of the ſecond Table, as <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 26. <hi>What is written in the Law? how readest thou? Math.</hi> 5. 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 13. 8. 9. 10. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 8. 11. &amp;c. And the reaſons of it may be theſe: 1. To teach his people that it is his will, that they ſhould be holy in all manner of converſation; therefore there is no piece of duty called for, but it is comprehended in a command, even the leaſt thing, eating, drinking, and whatſoever they do, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 10. 31. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15. 16. he would have them careful to be holy not only in the Church, but alſo in the Market<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the ſhop, at home, abroad, not only in prayer, but at the plough, &amp;c. 2. To hold out the great extent of holineſs, or what holineſs he requireth in his people; It was a great miſtake in the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that they placed the main part of Religion in the performance of external duties of the firſt Table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas the Lord layeth both Tables together, to tell that they muſt march up together in our practiſe, and that it will not be Holineſs in it's ſelf, and in Gods account to perform the one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other: 3. Becauſe the Lord would have his Law a perfect Rule, that the man of God might be perfect, throughly furniſhed to every good word and work. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17. therefore is the ſecond Table given, that we may know how to walk towards others as well as towards God, that Maſters may know their duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Servants theirs, &amp;c. and that none are left to an arbitrarineſs therein, but that all are tyed to a Rule: 4. Becauſe men are ready to ſlight holineſs in reference to the ſecond Table; hence there will be ſome kind of awe of God on men, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the duties of the firſt Table, ſo that they dare not altogether neglect prayer, hearing the word, &amp;c. and yet they will make little or no conſcience of loving their neighbour, or of ſhewing mercy, as we ſee in the <hi>Phariſees:</hi> 5. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is no leſs neceſſary for Chriſtians living together as to their Being and well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>being and mutual thriving, that they do duty one of them to another with reſpect to the command, then that they all do their duty to him; how elſe can folks live well together in a Family or other Societies, if each therein do not duty to another? the neglect of this makes them as a houſe divided againſt it ſelf, which cannot ſtand; 6. That the Lord may have the more clear and convincing ground of challenge againſt ſuch as ſlight theſe commands, and live in envy, malice, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp;c. for none can ſay he knew not theſe to be ſins, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>The Lord hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good, that thou do Juſtice, and love Mercy,</hi> &amp;c. and he beginneth at the Duties of the ſecond Table, the more to ſtop their mouths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If they ſhould ſay, they knew not that they ſhould be holy, or how to be holy in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:31633:112"/>
theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had it to ſay, that he had told them: For theſe, and ſuch like reaſons, the Lord hath been ſo particular in, and hath added his Authority unto, the commands of the ſecond Table as well as to theſe of the firſt, that we may lay the greater weight on them.</p>
               <p>From the Connection of the two Tables, we may obſerve theſe three generals, firſt, That there is no part of a mans converſation in reference to his walk with others as well as God, what ever be his Calling or Station, but he ought to be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and holy in it; God hath directed men how to carry in all things. 2. That it is a neceſſary part of Religion in reſpect of the command of God enjoyning it, and in order to our thriving in holineſs, to be conſcientious in duties to others, as well as in immediate duties to God, who in his Law requireth both. 3. That where kindly and true Obedience is given to the firſt Table, Obedience will be given to the ſecond alſo, where Conſcience putteth to pray and keep the Sabbath, it will alſo put to do duty to our Neighbour; he purpoſely putteth theſe together in the Goſpel, when the <hi>Phariſees</hi> would ſeparate them, and what God hath conjoyned let no man put aſunder.</p>
               <p>It may be here inquired: what it is to be religious in theſe common duties we owe to others? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though we cannot inſtance in any thing, wherein Religion hath not it`s place; yet we shal pitch on a few things, that it more eſpecially imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: And 1. It is neceſſary that the matter of the duty be commanded, and 2. That reſpect be had to the command in the doing of it, a man muſt not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his Family, but he muſt do it religiouſly, a Maſter muſt not uſe his Servants, as he pleaſeth, the Servant muſt not abuſe the Maſters ſimplicity, but obey in fear and trembling, &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 22. in which places the Apoſtle preſſeth Servants to look to theſe things, while many of them had Heathen Maſters (and what is ſpoken to them may be applyed to all, in all Callings and Stations, and ſerve to direct how to be religious in common duties). And 1. As to the end, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that they ſerve not men only, but the Lord, and ſo eye his glory, the adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Goſpel, the edification of others, there being nothing we do, wherein we ought not to have an higher end then our ſelves or men. 2. That they have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Motive in their Service, implyed in theſe words, <hi>not with eye Service, as men pleaſers,</hi> but as doing Service to the Lord in obedience to him, and not to men; not ſo much becauſe their Maſters command, as becauſe God commandeth; not for the fashion nor meerly for profit, but becauſe commanded of God. 3. That for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it be in ſingleneſs of heart chearfully and readily. 4. That reſpect be had to the promiſe as well as to the command, for their through bearing in their Service, and for their Encouragement in the Faith of their being accepted through Chriſt as it is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>Coll.</hi> 3. 24. elſe it were a ſad thing for a Chriſtian ſervant to be in hard Service, and have no more to expect but a but of meat and a penny-hire from men, but Chriſtian ſervants may eye the heavenly reward in ſweeping the houſe, as well as in the religious duties of Gods immediate worship.</p>
               <p>For helps to underſtand the commands of the ſecond Table, we may conſider theſe four Scriptures, which will hold out ſo many rules for that end: The 1. and principal one is <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 39. <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there should be a warmneſs of affection in us to our neighbour, oppoſite to hatred <hi>(Levit.</hi> 19. 17. 18.) revenge, malice, inward grudging; and no doubt this warmneſs of love, making a man meaſure his duty to others by the love he hath to himſelf, will notably help to underſtand and obſerve all the duties of the ſecond Table. The 2. is <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>Therefore all things, whatſoever ye would that men
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:31633:112"/>
should do to you, do ye even ſo to them,</hi> which is a rule of general equity, and is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to partiality and ſelf-love, which undermineth all the duties of the ſecond Table; and this is of a general and univerſal extent, to all perſons and things, ſuch as buying and ſelling, to duties betwixt man and wife, neighbour and neighbour, Maſter and Servant, &amp;c. The 3. is <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others,</hi> a notable effect of love, not only to wish well to our neighbours, but to ſeek and procure their good, and it is oppoſite to ſelfishneſs and regardleſneſs of the good of others, if we be well our ſelves. The 4. is <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>Be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love in honour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring one another,</hi> be kindly to, and manifeſt your eſteem of, your Neighbour, not in a complementing way, but really and heartily, which by <hi>James</hi> is called the <hi>fulfilling of the Law,</hi> and by the Apoſtle <hi>John the old</hi> and <hi>new commandement,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is more Religion then many are aware of, more then in knowledg, ſpecul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and empty notions: but oh! How short are we in theſe more common duties, that lye, as it were, among our feet? We come now to the Fifth command, which is the firſt of the ſecond Table, and it containeth 1. a precept. 2. a Promiſe, and ſo it is called by the Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>the firſt Command with promiſe,</hi> which muſt be upon one of theſe grounds, either 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe it is the firſt command that hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular promiſe, that promiſe in the Second command being general &amp; applicable (as it is actually applyed there) to all the commands, or 2. becauſe this is the firſt command of the ſecond Table; and often in the new Teſtament the commands are recknoned and inſtanced by that Table, eſpecially when duties betwixt man and man are preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And if it be ſaid, that it is the only command of the ſecond Table, that hath a promiſe, it is anſwered, it is the only command that hath an expreſs promiſe: Beſide it is not abſurd to read it thus, it is the firſt command <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of the ſecond Table; and to preſs it the more, the promiſe added to it is mentioned; ſo that to ur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e obedience to it the more ſtrongly, it is not only the firſt Command, ſaith the Apoſtle of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, but it hath a promiſe alſo added to it: And this certainly is the Apoſtles ſcope to preſs its obſervation.</p>
               <p>In the precept we are 1, To conſider the Object, <hi>Father and Mother:</hi> 2. The Duty, <hi>honour.</hi> 1. Again, concerning the firſt, it is to be conſidered that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in its ſcope reſpecteth the duty that we owe to all Relations, whether they be above us, inferiour to us, or equal with us: This is clear from Chriſts ſumming all the ſecond Table, and conſequently this command with the reſt, in that comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive general, <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> and therefore our Neighbour in general muſt be the object of this Command, as well as of the reſt, and ſo it tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in all the duties of honour that every one oweth to another, whatever be their place; there is a duty of honour and reſpect called for from every one to every one: And ſo <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 22. it is preſſed upon Wives toward their Husbands; and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. upon Husbands towards their Wives, which muſt be comprehended here: Thus Father and Mother are hear to be largely and ſynecdochically underſtood, one ſort of Relations being in a figurative manner put for all the reſt. 2. Under them are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all Superiours for place, in Church or Common-wealth, who in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture get the Title of Fathers, as Magiſtrates, Supreme and Subltern, Miniſters and all Church-Officers, Teachers, Overſeers, and all in the place of Fathers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15. yea, they who are to be eſteemed, as ſuch for gifts of Learning, Wiſdom, Grace and Piety, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 2. or for their worldly means and outward eſtate, as <hi>Joſepb</hi> was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45, 8. or for their age, and the reverence due to them on that account, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 12. in a word, any ſort of emenencie putteth one in that roll of Fathers
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:31633:113"/>
largely taken, though they be not properly ſuch. 3. We are called in the firſt place to look to the duties of this relation, as it is domeſtick, ſuch as of a Maſter over the Servant, of a Huſband over the Wife, &amp;c. and then cometh the carriage of one toward another in general, and though moſt properly the duties of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, mediate or immediate, over their Children or Nephews, be here pointed at, which is moſt literal, yet the former alſo is included, all particulars of that kind being by a figure comprehended under one.</p>
               <p>If it be asked here, Why the mother is added? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe although the mother be not ſo qualified for the rule and government of the Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet ſhe is no leſs intituled to their acknowledgment and this parental honour by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, toil, and tenderneſs of their birth and education, and in this, as well as in the diſpoſition of the members of the body mentioned 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 22. 23, and 24. the excellent attemperation of God, wiſdom is very conſpicuous, by ballanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greater authority of the Father with the greater pains and care of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Childrens duty of love, honour, and gratitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may return to both with a ſuitable equality. 2. She is added to ſhew that it is not only the moſt eminent Superiour or Neighbour to whom honour is due, but even theſe who have more weakneſs, and eſpecially the <hi>Mother:</hi> Hence it is that alwayes almoſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, where duty to the Father is preſſed, the Mother is alſo named with him, to ſhew that Children ſhould not think that leſs reſpect is due to the Mother then to the Father; yea, ſometimes the Mother is prefixed to the Father, as <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 3. <hi>Ye ſhall fear every man his Mother and his Father,</hi> which is done to meet with the humour of many who are ready to leſſen their duty to their Mother, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are called to it even in her old age, <hi>Prov</hi> 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22. and to guard againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing of her then, which is too readily and frequently incident. Thus doth the Lord provide in his word againſt our corruption, which is ready to take advantage of debording and outbreaking at the weakeſt part.</p>
               <p>If it be further asked, Why all Superiours, yea all Neighbours, are ſpoken of as <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Mothers? Anſw.</hi> Theſe reaſons are obvious from the ſcope: I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is 1. to ſhew that the duties of this Command are mutual amongſt all relations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it giveth Superiours their due, yet ſo as that it teacheth them alſo how to carry to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their Inferiours, that is, to be Fathers to them; and that the relation neceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arily implyeth a mutual tye; therefore this Command doth not only direct inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours in their duty towards Superiours, but alſo Superiours in their duty to their Inferiours. 2. They get this name to make their ſubjection to each other, and their mutual relations and duties the more ſweet and kindly, when the ſubjection is to be given as by a Son to a Father, and when it is exacted and expected as by a Father from a Son; which conſideration ſhould be a kindly motive to all mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual duties, and alſo an inducement to hide infirmities; and to conſtruct tenderly of failings. And thus the denomination of the natural relation ſeems to be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, to eſtabliſh and ſtrengthen the poſitive Relation, which of its ſelf is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſo binding of the Conſcience by Nature's light. So much for the Object of thus Duty.</p>
               <p>The Duty it ſelf here called for, is <hi>honour,</hi> which is alſo largely to be underſtood, both as it taketh in the inward eſteem of others in our heart, and alſo the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing of this in outward expreſions in our converſation: For by this Command
<pb facs="tcp:31633:113"/>
it appeareth that there is, 1. Some eminencie in every man; 2. That every one ſhould obſerve that and honour it in another; What is it then to <hi>honour them?</hi> It is not to complement them, and only ſeemingly to reverence them, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it conſiſteth eſpecially in theſe, 1. In obſerving and acknowledging what is eminent in any for nature, grace, ſtation, or other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accidental things, and if there appear no more in a man, yet as he beareth any thing of Gods Image, or is a Chriſtian and Member of Chriſts Church, he is thus to be honoured. 2. There ought to be an eſteem of him, and we ſhould really have an honourable account of him, and that in ſome reſpect beyond our ſelves in ſome one thing or other. 3. It lyeth much in love, and kindly or affectionate reverence, as is hinted <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 10. 4. It taketh in obedience according to our ſtations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> flowing from a diſpoſition of heart to obey, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. 5. It reacheth both to the thought of the heart, and to our ſecret carriage, there ſhould not be in our ſecret chamber any deſpiſing or wiſhing ill to him, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20. 6. It comprehendeth a holy fear and aw that ſhould be joyned with it, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 3.</p>
               <p>Honour being thus fixed in the heart, it is to be expreſſed, 1. In words, by reſpective and reverent ſpeaking and giving anſwers, or making ſuits; <hi>Sarah</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her Husband <hi>Lord,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 3. 6. 2. It is expreſſed in geſtures by bowing riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, keeping ſilence ſometimes before others. <hi>Job.</hi> 29. not anſwering again, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 9. ſaluting, &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 15. 3. In deeds, by obedience and teſtifying reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that way which is generally called <hi>gratitude,</hi> therefore obedience to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 1. is drawn from this Command, which preſſeth obedience upon men according to their relations 4. In our means, communicating thereof when it is called for; ſo tribute to whom tribute is due, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7. and double honour to the Elders that rule well, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 5. 17. acording to the acceptation of honour uſed in that precept, <hi>Honour the Lord with thy ſubstance, Prov.</hi> 3. 9. 5. In our prayers for them 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. 6. In covering their infirmities, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 21. 22.</p>
               <p>As the breaches of this Command may be eaſily gathered hence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as being oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to theſe, ſo this rule is alwayes to be carried along in practice, that this honour and obedience muſt be ſtill <hi>in the Lord;</hi> that is, there muſt be a reſerving to the Lord his due, for God is the ſupreme Father, and all our reſpect to under-fathers of the fleſh is to be ſubordinate to the Father of Spirits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. ſo as he may have the firſt place for whoſe cauſe we give reverence to them, &amp; ſo that word is ſtill true, <hi>Acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. <hi>It is better to obey God then man;</hi> man is only to be obeyed in the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 1. And thus refuſing to comply with unjuſt commands, is not diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Parents, but high obedience to God, the refuſal being conveyed reſpectful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and after the due manner.</p>
               <p>Again the branches of this Command are exceeding large; two things by it are eſpecially called for, 1. Love, 2 Honour, and whatever is oppoſite to and inconſiſtent with theſe, is a breach of this Command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein we are to obſerve, 1. The object of our love and reſpect, it is <hi>all men,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Honour all men; love the Brotherhood;</hi> our Neighbour here in the largeſt ſenſe comprehending <hi>all men;</hi> 2. Conſider that the act of love and honour that is required is moſt intenſe. we muſt love onr Neighbour as our ſelf, and this reacheth far. 3. Conſider that it tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in all that is our Neighbours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his name, fame, credit, and eſtate, &amp;c. but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love to his ſalvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe in this moſtly doth his concernment lye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.

                     </gap> up an evil report againſt his Neighbour,</hi> even when it is brought to him and laid before him. 5. Yet there is a difference to be obſerved in the putting forth of our love and teſtifying of our reſpect; for we ſhould love him as our ſelves, but in giving reſpect and honour, we are to prefer others to our ſelves: to love our Neighbours as our ſelves, importeth the kind and reality of our love, we are to love him no leſs truly then our ſelves (for we alſo come in here as the objects of our own love) but we are ſome way to honour him beyond our ſelves.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, How can that be? 1. That one ſhould love all men? Should we love them all alike and equally? And 2. ought we to prefer every man to our ſelves?</p>
               <p>To the former we ſay. 1. This Command requireth, as to the object, that we love all men, excluding none from our love good or bad (while they are within the roll of men, capable to be prayed for) friend or enemy, for we ſhould love them that hate us, and bleſs them that curſe us. 2. As to the main things deſtred, or the ſubject matter of our wiſhes for them, our love ſhould be alike to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all; our love being a willing of good to others, we ſhould deſire the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good to all men, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> peace with God, Chriſt, Heaven, Sanctification, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, &amp;c. that lead to it, there is here no inequality, nor two Heavens, a greater and a leſſer to be the ſubject matter of our wiſhes and deſires. 3. If we conſider our love as to the act of loving in the kind of it, it is equal, we being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to love ſincerely cordialy, and with the whole heart, perfectly; every man.</p>
               <p>If ye ask then, Wherein is there any difference allowed? <hi>Anſw.</hi> If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider 1. The effects of this Love, they may and ought to be more manifeſted towards one then another; we are to pray more for one then another; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate and to diſtribute more to one then to another, according to the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities we have, and according to the particulare relations and callings that God putteth us in; for beſide our general relation to all men, we have particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to ſome beyond others; hence may a man do more for his Children, and theſe of his own houſe, then for others; ſo may we pray for ſome men more and oftner, as their neceſſity is concerned, and as they may be more uſeful. 2. In reſpect of frequencie, our Love may and ought to vent it ſelf more frequently towards ſome then others, and ſo it differeth from that general Love we owe to all. 3. In reſpect of ſympathy, we are to be more touched with the hurt and hazard of ſome and more ſenſibly deſirous of their good then of that of others, and ſo our love ought to affect us more, and ſtir more ſenſibly in reference to ſome then others, as in the caſe of a woman toward her Child, and of one dear friend to another; ſuch was the ſympathy between <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> who thought they loved many others, yet was there a more peculiar ſympathy betwixt themſelves as to all things that concerned them, good and evil; thus may ariſe from natural relalions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> particular obligations, mutual familiarity, and others ſpecial grounds. 4 According to the diverſity of concurrent circumſtances, we may ſometimes wiſh temporal good to one, and ſometimes temporal rods to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; providing alwayes it be out of a true deſire of, and reſpect to their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In reſpect of complacencie and delight accompanying the Act of
<pb facs="tcp:31633:114"/>
loving there may be a difference<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for there may be much more delight and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in loving one then another, as there appeareth more of holineſs in one then another; ſo godly men love even natural men if of good parts, civil and friendly, more then others that are deſtitute of ſuch qualifications; but it men be alſo gracious, they not only love them the more, but alſo acquieſce the more and have the greater complacencie in them on that account.</p>
               <p>If it be asked from whence theſe differences, as to the effects of our love do flow? <hi>Anſw.</hi> They may ariſe 1. From natural relations; 2. From the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that is among men in their carriages, humours, and ſuch like, as they are leſs or more ingaging; 3. From external circumſtances, of acquaintance, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, or particular ingagements; 4. From favours, ſo men may love their benefactors more (in the forementioned ſenſe) then others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. From civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and intreſts; 6 They may ariſe from a religious and chriſtian intereſt and relation, ſo we are to love the godly, not only more then other men in the world, but alſo we are to love them 1. on another account than we love others, to wit, becauſe they are ſuch, becauſe they are true members of the ſame body, are loved of God, and have his Image ſhining in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. With more delight and acquieſeing complacencie, as <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 3. 3. There ſhould be another way of venting our love to them then to others, both in ſpiritual and temporal things, thus loving the <hi>Brotherhood</hi> is diſtinguiſhed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 17. from loving or honouring <hi>all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ſo alſo the <hi>houſhold of faith, Gal.</hi> 6. 10, is eſpecially to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in our love.</p>
               <p>If it be asked then, How differeth love to the godly from common love? <hi>Anſw.</hi> That there is a difference, is clear from the forcited Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 3. 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 2. 17. and from 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. where brotherly kindneſs is diſtinguiſhed from charity: In a word then, it differeth 1. In it's acquieſcing complacencie, though there may be ſome ſort of complacencie comparatively in others, yet ſimply and properly it is to be exerciſed toward the godly. 2. It is on another account as is ſaid, to wit, as they are loved of God, love to them runneth in another channel, and hath another ſpring and riſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10, <hi>ult.</hi> 3. It ſhould be in a more high and intenſe degree, as to its exerciſe, becauſe God is more concerned in them; and though good ſhould be done to all, yet eſpecially to this <hi>houſhold of Faith.</hi> And the manifeſtation of our love even towards the godly may be leſs or more, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as leſs or more of God appeareth in them, or in their way.</p>

When it is ſubſervient and ſubordinate to higher ends, and can hazard it ſelf, and deny it ſelf for Gods honour, for a publick good yea, and in ſome caſes, out of reſpect to the good of others alſo, ſo a righteous man ſhould, and when at himſelf, will do much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though with his own hazard, for a Chriſtian friend, for the ſafety or edification of the Godly, or in defence of the inte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>reſt of Chriſt. 2.

As the firſt ſelf-love marreth duties to God, and thwarteth with them; ſo the ſecond advanceth them and ſweyeth ſtrongly, yet ſweetly to them.</p>
               <p>Again, This Command is the firſt in order of the ſecond Table, and is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly backed with a promiſe, to ſhew the concernment of the duty called for, the ſcope of it being to regulate that reſpect which each on oweth to another, that they may give each other due honour as the firſt effect of love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the great band of all the other commands and enjoyned duties of the ſecond Table, God being pleaſed

to provide for that reſpect and honour that is due from one man to another, as well as for the ſecurity of their perſons and eſtates, yea in ſome reſpect he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this Command, to wit, that one hurt not another in their honour and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to theſe other relating to their perſons and eſtates, and therefore he requireth honour in the firſt place, and afterward injoyneth the duties of not <hi>killing,</hi> not <hi>ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And although every man doth love reſpect and eſtimation among others, yet there is nothing wherein more liberally and even prodigally men incroach upon one another, then by the neglect and denyal of this duty, and by the contrary ſin, though it be moſt directly op poſite to love, and that general equity commanded whereby we ſhould <hi>Do to others as we would have them to do to us,</hi> Therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lord hath preferred this to the other five Commands, and hath ſo backed it with a promiſe, and alſo ſet it down poſitively, <hi>Honour thy Father,</hi> &amp;c. for this end, that we may know it is not enough not to deſpiſe them, if they be not alſo poſitively honoured by us, even as it is not enough, not to prophane the Lords day by common and unneceſſary works, if we do not poſitively ſanctifie it: And it is not for nought that this duty is ſo much preſſed, being a main bond of Chriſtian and Civil Fellowſhip, keeping folks within the juſt bounds and limits which God hath ſet unto them.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, What this duty of honouring our Neighbour doth include? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It doth include theſe five things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. Reſpect to our Neighbours perſon; 2. to his place: 3. to his qualifications, either as he is furniſhed with natural or moral abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or as he is gracious; 4. to his accidental furniture in externals, a riches, credit with others &amp;c. ſo <hi>David</hi> honoured <hi>Nabal;</hi> 5. in reſpect of mens actions as they deſerve, or as they have done, or atchieved any thing where by good cometh, or may come to the Church or Commonwealth, <hi>Honour</hi> includeth the giving reſpect to onr Neighbour in all theſe.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, If and how honour differeth from love? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It differeth from love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that love properly conſidereth men more generally, as they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of good, which we wiſh unto them: but this conſidereth them more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, as ſo and ſo qualified, and having ſuch and ſuch things in them deſerving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; for honour being bearing of teſtimony to ſomething worthy of reſpect in ſuch a one, it doth firſt conſider what is worthy of honour in the perſon, that ſo it may bear a teſtimony truly, according as it findeth ground.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, Whether ontward expreſſive evidences of honour are alwayes to be given to the perſons honoured? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although indeed in honouring of God there needeth not alwayes an external expreſſive evidence of it; as for inſtance, a man may in the croud of Company honour God by ejaculatory Prayer without ſuch external expreſſion, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did in the preſence of the King and Queen, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 4. yet honour given to others muſt not only have the acknowledging of ſomething worthy of eſtimation within, that it degenerate not into diſſimulation, as the ordinary complementing ſtrain doth, but muſt alſo have expreſſions without, to bear witneſs unto that which is within, in geſture, words, or other wayes, as men are called to the giving of them.</p>

It will make him live with him as (to him at leaſt) negatively gracious, and accept of what he ſaith for truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not knowing any thing to the contrary, in ſo far as Chriſtian prudence will permit him; and thus far a charitable conſtruction will lead us in reference to our Neighbour, for we are not bound poſitively without ground to determine a thing to be right or wrong, or a man gracious or wicked when we have not certain knowledge, and ſo may be deceived; but we ought to walk with men whoſe bypocriſie and diſhoneſty we know not, as with good and honeſt men, yea, even where ſome ſlips or eſcapes are to be found. 2. Honour comprehendeth and taketh in humility ſo far as it reſpecteth and relateth to a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble carriage amongſt men, which is a grace moderating a man ſo, that he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not himſelf inordinately to others, either in reſpect of place or parts, or other ſuch like grounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which Chriſt commendeth in the Goſpel; and enjoyneth that men ſhould not love the uppermoſt rooms, or firſt ſalutations, but ſeek to prefer others, and be to their own honour as weaned children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or new born babes, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. 3. readier to ſerve and give honour to others, then deſirous of ſervice and honour from them, and this not in complement, but in reality. 3. It tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in eſteem of others, and vindicating of their name and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now all theſe effects of honour are to be drawn forth according to the ſtations we are in, and the relations we ſuſtain, and as we ſtand in reference to others according to their ſtations and relations, of husband, wife, ſervant, maſter, ſon, father, friend, &amp;c. And no doubt more even of this owtward reſpect would contribute not alttle to our hearty and comfortable living together.</p>
               <p>Theſe being ſome of the commanded duties the contrary vices are prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as 1. <hi>Raſh judging,</hi> taking up a prejudice upon unſure grounds that will not bear ſuch a thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this may be either a weakneſs proceeding from ignorance; or a prejudice flowing from malice at the mans perſon, which is more readily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to conſtrue ſo and ſo of ſuch a man and his Actions then of another: The firſt may be removed, &amp; the perſon faulty in it will be deſirous to have it removed,

and will eſteem more of the perſon miſtaken, when it is removed, as <hi>Eli</hi> did for <hi>Hannah</hi> 17. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 17. The ſecond is hardly removed and admitteth not of the mean which may remove it, leaving no room for information, Apology, Vindication, &amp;c. 2. <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Preſumption</hi> are condemned here, <hi>Pride</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one with <hi>Diotrephes</hi> affecteth the preheminency, a higher office or precedency in the ſame office, the firſt ſalutation, the higheſt room at Table, &amp;c. <hi>Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> whereby a man is ready to undertake ſomething above his ability, as if he were more fit and able for it then indeed he is; even as on the contrary Puſillanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a ſcarring to reach to, and adventure upon, what a man is able for, and called to. 3. <hi>Vanity</hi> or <hi>vain Glory,</hi> much blazing abroad our own good actions, or delighting to have them known to others, that they may blaze them. 4 <hi>Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> making ſhew of what good is in us, and following what is good for that end, and in ſuch a way as it may be taken notice of by men, as the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who only ſought their own glory in their prayers and alms. 5. <hi>Envy,</hi> which is a grief and ſadneſs for the honour of another, that ſuch a good Turn ſhould fall in his hand, or that he ſhould be honoured, followed or reſpected, as if his being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and preferred did detract from their own credit and honour; it differeth from <hi>fear,</hi> which is a ſadneſs that an Enemy is preferred, becauſe they may ſuffer and be in hazard from him; this Envy floweth principally from pride, whereby folks would monopolize all honour, and what is honourable unto themſelves, and are grieved when it is not ſo, a manifeſt fruit of the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 21. and a prime and moſt deſtructive enemy to Graces, and yet very rife in this hypocritical age, and much incident to religious folks, eſpecially to Miniſters and perſons of gifts; an ambitious humour, coveting to excel and darken all that are about them, when as it were much more Chriſtian and congruous for a man to whom God may have given more then he hath done to others, ſelf denyedly to vail, and ſtudiouſly to obſcure himſelf in ſome Caſes, leaſt he ſadden or Eclipſe others or draw more Obſervation to himſelf. 6. <hi>Emulation,</hi> which is a ſeeking to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond another in eſteem, not from any love of vertue, but only out of an envious deſire of having the prehemience of ſuch a perſon, of out ſtripping him, and of bearing him down in his reputation; it followeth on the former. 7. <hi>Detraction,</hi> a vice whereby men underſtand whiſper what may be to the diſhonour of another, even though it be a truth, uſing inſinuations, and ſuch a manner of ſeeming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the detracted, as may make the blot and infamy to ſtick as when many commendations are given a man, not out of any reſpect to him, but to make ſome reproach caſt upon him go down the better, and be the more eaſily believed, as coming from ſuch a one who reſpecteth and loveth the man; as, he is diſcreet, of great parts, &amp;c. <hi>but</hi> by which <hi>but</hi> all is overturned. 8, <hi>Contention and Strief</hi> are alſo oppoſite to this command, and any thing whereby, directly or indirectly, mediately or immediately, the fame of our Brother, and his eſtimation is reflected upon, which are of a large extent. 9. <hi>Mocking, diſdaining, taunting,</hi> and ſuch like are plainly againſt this command and forbidden in it.</p>
               <p>There are ſome Queſtions that do ariſe from what is ſaid:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Quest</hi> If all men ſhould be honoured? Yea, if even wicked men alſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Wicked men known to be ſuch cannot be honoured, as if they were gracious; neither can any place or dignity, meerly as ſuch, have what is due and proper to grace attributed to it without guilt, the doing whereof we conceive
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:31633:117"/>
is that ſin reproved by <hi>James chap.</hi> 2. 1. to wit, the accounting of rich men, that were wicked to be more religious then others not ſo rich, and poſſibly there may be much guilt of this ſin in Titles and Dedications of Books<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the <hi>moſt religious pious,</hi> &amp;c. are often unwarrantably put among the Styles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet there is a civil honour, which they may get, and we are called to give them upon ſeveral accounts as 1. on the account of their place, if <hi>Magistrates, honour to whom honour is due,</hi> is in that reſpect enjoyned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7. 2. Of their relation, if they be <hi>Fathers, Mothers,</hi> &amp;c. as it is 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3 3. Of their other Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and parts, or on other accounts, yea even on this general account, that they are men having immortal fouls, capable of grace, &amp; of being reſtored to Gods Image, our evidencing of honour to them is called for,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Quest.</hi> If rich men ſhould be honoured? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Riches of themſelves, and for themſelves, are not honourable, neither can they make the Poſſeſſor ſuch: But Riches may make one capable of doing more good, and of being more uſeful in Church and Commonwealth, and conſequently of being deſervedly honoured; and no doubt a rich man is to be reſpected, as a ſteward intruſted with ſome thing to be employed for the honour of God, and for the good of others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and riches, when well improved to theſe ends, they become uſeful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore in that Caſe the Profeſſors of them are to be honoured; but when abuſed, the perſon is more vile, ſo <hi>David,</hi> at firſt, honoured <hi>Nabal</hi> as a Father, and called himſelf his Son, but after that his churliſhneſs appeared and diſcovered it ſelf ſo groſly, there was on ſuch honour due to him, nor given him.</p>
               <p>As to what the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> diſcourſeth <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 1. 2. certainly he doth not there ſimply condemn all reverencing of rich men, but the doing of it, 1. On a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous account, and in religious things, 2. When there was only care taken for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating them in Aſſemblies, and no care all for accommodating poor ones, as if becauſe they were not rich they had been without all intereſt in the Goſpel; the honouring of the one and that joynetly with the contempt of the other made the fruit. 3. It was condemned by him, becauſe done for an evil end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> for ſlattering of rich men, theſe reprove by bhim for doing it, not being ſingle, but ſelfiſh in what they did, ſeeking only their own advantage. 4 The preferring of rich men as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and becauſe, they are ſuch, as more religious then poor ones, who it may be have much more religion then they, is the acceptation of perſons condemned here by the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> to wit, when a rich man is preferred as more godly, and only becauſe more rich; before a poor man alike godly or more godly then he.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Wherein conſiſteth the difference that is betwixt the reſpect, which is to be given to a good man, and that which is to be given to another, when both are alike in outward things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It may be that in outward ſignes and evidences of reſpect there be no difference, the one may get as low courteſie as the other. But 2. There is a heart Teſtimony and reſpect ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> had in the conſciences generally of all, but eſpecially of his gracious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>earers, that is, an Approbation that he is worthy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, not only for the outward capacity he is in to do good, but for actual improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it to that end, which is a far other thing then outward Civility.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this there is a difference betwixt the reſpect given to the one,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:31633:117"/>
and that which is given to the other; in that ſome-thing of gracious conformity to the Image of God, beſide other common commendable Qualifications, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the good man, he is (at leaſt ought to be) with more complacency de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, then the natural man, though as to outward things in the ſame Station with him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Honour floweth more natively to the Godly, the object drawing it unto it in a native way.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, whither or not a man may ſeek his own honour and fame, and how? <hi>Anſw.</hi> A man ought not to ſeek it, as men of the world do, to ſatisfie the luſt of the pride of life: nor inordinately beyond his line, nor even in externals-no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ever as his laſt end, and as the chief thing; for honor being the Teſtimony of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and a good name, a Teſtimony of that vertue which is in a man, he is firſt to ſtudy vertue as the ſolid good, whereof the other is but the luſtre, vertue being indeed the main thing to be ſought after, whether a good name (as to men) be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate from it or not. 2. Yet may it be ſought as a thing that is deſirable and good (it being ſought in a right manner and by way of concomitance) <hi>a good name being above great riches,</hi> Prov. 22. 1. 3. It is ever to be ſought in the way of vertue and welldoing; flattery and crooked dealing being never warrantable, and in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Good, men are to walk through ill report as well as good report. 4. It is to be ſought in things relating to Godlineſs, not in riches, or honor, or eloquence, or great learning, but honeſty, faithfulneſs, holineſs; thus <hi>Paul</hi> diſclaimeth, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the applauſe of being a learned, or eloquent or wiſe man, he diſdained theſe; ſeeking it only in the faithful, ſingle and zealous diſcharge of his Miniſtry among the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> 5. This Teſtimony or Reſpect is to be ſought after even with a piece of holy ambition in the Conſciences of others, but not ſo much in the outward evidences and teſtifications of it: To be commended and approved in the conſciences of theſe we live among is deſirable, and that which alſo <hi>Paul,</hi> himſelf aimed at. 6. This reſpect would be a ſtep for an higher end, that ſo all our reſpect may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and made uſe of for the honour of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Queſt.</hi> If it be asked how, and in what manner, are we to purſue or ſeek our own honour? <hi>Anſw.</hi> See what the Scripture ſaith, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. <hi>Them that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me I will honour:</hi> And firſt the honouring of God is praiſe-worthy and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in it ſelf; Gold hath not more its luſtre, a Rubie or Diamond its beauty, nor the ſun its light and glory, then godlineſs and vertue, whereby God is honoured, are radiant to their own praiſe. 2. If after by reaſon of human infirmity, and other diſadvantages, this radiancy be obſcured, or through mens ignorance, folly or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, this worthineſs not obſerved or not eſteemed, the Lord undertakes for the former, and vindicates from the latter, telling us plainly, <hi>them that honour me, I will honour,</hi> and hence it is, that we ſo often find in Scripture, honour attributed to thoſe things that are ſo low and mean in the eyes of men, as 1. To taking with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 16. 2. To yielding to Correction, even when unjuſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. 3. To Submiſſion to parents, as in this command. 4.

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 6. If it be asked, how one can fulfill that part of the command, enjoyning us to prefer another to our ſelves? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is not to be univerſally and ſimply:
<pb facs="tcp:31633:118"/>
underſtood, as if we were called in every thing to do ſo, and to every perſon, for we may know that ſome are more ignorant and more prophane than we are in many practiſes, guilty of things we may be free of, and ſo we are not obliged to judge contrary to truth: Yet 2. in ſome one reſpect or other we may prefer them, as 1. In that they may have ſomething beyond us, they are poſſibly more humble, more ſingle, zealous, diligent, &amp;c. though inferiour to us in other things. 2. They may have much good we know not. 3. We certainly know, or at leaſt may know, more evil in our ſelves than in them, and therefore are to prefere them to our ſelves. 4. We know more aggravations of our own evils then of theirs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſimply we may without hypocriſie prefer men generally to our ſelves, though we in particulars could not do ſo, nor give unto every one in every thing the precedency.</p>
               <p>We come now to ſpeak a little of the promiſe, which is added to ſtir up to the more ſerious Obſervation of this command, and as for the nature of it, it is a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral one, peculiarly applyed to <hi>Iſrael</hi> here, yet generally agreeing to all and ſo applyed as to the ſubſtance of it by the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6 2. 3. where he putteth <hi>earth for land,</hi> whereby he inſinuateth that it is to be underſtood of any land where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God ſhall pleaſe to caſt a mans Lot to reſide or inhabit as well as of <hi>Jude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> ſo then.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, whether or not this promiſe is to be ſimply underſtood; and the accompliſhment of it without any reſtriction expected or looked for? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this promiſe ſeems to have a peculiar reſpect unto that Diſpenſation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not only the Saints everlaſting reſt was prefigured by that temporal reſt in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but alſo the more obſcure manifeſtations of the life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality brought to light by the Goſpel, ſupplyed as it were by more full and aſſuring promiſes of earthly bleſſings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet ſeeing the Apoſtle, as we have touched, doth in the preſſing of this command alſo accommodate to us it's promiſe, we think it holds out that ſuch, who through Grace are enabled to give obedience to the command, may by vertue of the promiſe annexed, expect from God even out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, in ſo far as the having of them, ſhall be for their good and ſpiritual advantage. And 2. They may with confidence promiſe themſelves, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have in the world, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how many or few days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſoever they may have in it, yet all ſhall be with Gods bleſſing and peace: And 3. That their death ſhall never be untimely: And 4. What ſeeming defect ſoever may be in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as to length of days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here ſhal be abundantly made up by eternity hereafter in Heaven; what then will or can be the prejudice of few days on Earth?</p>
               <p>From the annexing of this promiſe to the command, theſe two things clearly follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. That there are temporal promiſes made to Godlineſs. 2. That a Godly man hath that right which none other hath to inherit the earth.</p>
               <p>If it be asked here, whether or not a wicked man hath a right to any thing in the world? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is a threefold right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the firſt is, a <hi>creature-right,</hi> whereby any of Gods creatures have a right to any thing in his creation that is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them, when it is ſimply neceſſary, and not occupied by another under the like need; and after the ſimilitude of this right, Crows, and ſo other living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may take their meat one the field of any man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus a man ſtarving, may for himſelf, or his brother (if in the like condition) when the proper owner of any Corn
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:31633:118"/>
cannot be gotten, put to his hand and tak of them for preventing of death by hunger and ſo likewayes it may be in other things all things being made for the uſe of man at the firſt, and committed to him; and the orderly dividing of mens lots and portions, having been but the better to further that end, and not to marr it, is not to take place when it thwarteth with it; thus the Diſciples did pluck and eat the ears of Corn when they were an hungred, though the corn was not their own: God alſo, who hath the abſolute dominion, hath ſo given to man a property, that he hath reſerved a right to himſelf to make uſe of it (when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth) for the good of other creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus he provideth for Crows Ravens, &amp;c. out of one mans ſtock or other. 2. There is a poſitive or <hi>Civil right</hi> amongſt men, ſo that one man hath right to ſuch a piece of Land, another not; both theſe rights a wicked man may have, and both Land and ſuch right to it good men may often want in particular caſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that if there were a civil conteſt betwixt a good man and a wicked for ſome Land or other ſuch thing, the qualifications of the perſons would neither make the right of the one better, or more valid, nor of the, other, worſe or leſs valid, as we may ſee <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 15. 3. There is a right by grace which ſanctifieth the former rights, and putteth a man in caſe not only warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably before men, but alſo before God, to make uſe of the creatures, ſo that he may ſee and viſit his Tabernacle, and take the moderate uſe of any lawful refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not ſin, <hi>Job</hi> 5. 24. The man hath not only his daily bread, but hath it by Gods promiſe, and upon this ground we pray, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread;</hi> this right his peculiar to a Believer and godly man, which none other, poſſeſs what they will, can lay claim unto, for godlineſs and no other thing, <hi>Hath the promiſe both of this life and of that which is to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 8. therefore we may upon good ground ſay, that <hi>Godlineſs is great gain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be yet further asked, But what advantage have godly men by theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral promiſes? <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is not their advantage to be alway abounding in theſe owtward things; that is neither ſo <hi>de facto</hi> and eventually, nor were it meet it ſhould be ſo; but 1. they have a promiſe of what is needful and uſeful, ſimply even of temporal things which no wicked man hath, they ſhall, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. <hi>want no good thing,</hi> yea, <hi>though lyons ſuffer hunger, Pſal.</hi> 34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. <hi>yet they that ſeek the Lord, ſhal not want any good thing.</hi> 2 They may pray for theſe things ſo far as they are needful, and may confidently expect them and go to God for them by vertue of that right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ere they get them ſo, <hi>Matth</hi> 6. 11. It is our daily bread by allowance and promiſed before we get it. 3 If a natural man abound, he cannot promiſe himſelf the continuance of meat till the end of his life; no, not ſo much as his dinner to morrow, nor life till then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if a Believer live, he may expect the continuance of as much food as ſhall be neceſſary for him; if he have nothing, he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently promiſe himſelf both life and food to morrow, if either or both of them be needful more nor a wicked man that hath more wealth, health, and outward protection can do. 4 He may promiſe himſelf the bleſſing and the ſanctified uſe of what he enjoyeth, which another cannot. 5. He may have peace, whether he have or want, in the injoyment of creaturs, or in their ſcarcity becauſe he hath a right to them, for it is not from want of right to creature comforts that ſcarcity of them cometh, but God, like a wiſe and skilful Phyſitian keepeth back meat for health where there is abundance in the right, and to be given alſo when needful; ſo that comparing him with a wicked man, whether he have or want,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:31633:119"/>
whether he enjoy more plentifully, or be in ſcarcity, he hath ſtill the better of him by fare; which should make us all love godlineſs the more, which hath ſo great an advantage as this attending it.</p>
               <p>Thus much in short of the promiſe annexed to this Command. To deſcend to ſpeak particularly of all the ſeveral relations comprehended under it, as of Magiſtrates and Subjects: Church-Officers, Paſtors, Guids and Rulers, and ordinary Church members; Husbands and Wives; Parents and Children; Maſters and Servants, &amp;c. and of their reſpective duties, would be a large task, and draw us forth a great length beyond our deſign in this undertaking; and ſomewhat to this purpoſe being already ſpoken from the third and fourth Chapters of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> which the bleſt Author was then in his Sabbath afternoon-Sermons opening up to the ſame Congregation that heard him lecture on the Commands) and all of them being, too many at leaſt, more known, then alaſs they are practiſed (thought indeed we know no more in Gods account then we ſingly deſire, deſign, and endeavour through grace to practiſe, and they all, and they only having a good underſtanding that keep his Commandements, <hi>John</hi> 13. 17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 10.) and ſince withall, if the generals we have hinted at in the expoſition of this Command be well underſtood, ſeriouſly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and conſcienſciouſly in the Lords ſtrength, practically improved; they will not a little, through his bleſſing, contribute for helping us, ſutably to acquit our ſelves in the diſcharge of all the particular duties of theſe ſeveral relations; we shall now forbear to be particular; and shall only ſay in the general of theſe ſtation and relation duties, that as, if a ſerious Chriſt an and truly goodly man be ſought after, he is in a ſpecial manner to be found in them, ſo, when ſanctifiedly, ſutably and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably performed, they in a ſpecial manner ado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Before we proceed further amongſt many Queſtions that might ariſe here, one word to theſe two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether ought a Father to love his Son, or a Son to love his Father moſt? <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Son ought to love his Father moſt, as repreſenting moſt of God; and the Father ought to love his Son moſt, as comprehending moſt of himſelf; ſuch mutual reſpects may exceed one another on different accounts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether is the Father or Magiſt are moſt to be obeyed, if they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand contrarily? <hi>Anſw.</hi> If that which is commanded be a thing belonging to the Magiſtrates place to command in, as where ſuch a one should live, what charge or office he should bear in the Common-wealth, and ſuch like; <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is to be obeved, for theſe things are ſought by the Magiſtrate from him not as a Son, but as a member of the Common-wealth, whoſe good principally should be eyed, and had reſpect to: but if it be <hi>a</hi> thing that belongeth to the Father, and not to the Magiſtrate to command in, as what Husband or Wife a Child should marry, and ſuch like, that belongeth to the Father as a Father, and ſo is to be obeyed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of the contrary command of the other.</p>
               <p>The ſcope of this Command being to moderate men in their exceſſive deſires after honour, and to direct and regulate them in giving reſpect to others; and in ſeeking of it to themſelves, and to inform us, that by no means we should wrong the eſtimat on of others more then their perſons and eſtates; ere we lay aſide ſpeaking of it, it will be
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:31633:119"/>
meet to ſpeak a little of <hi>humility,</hi> and the contraries and oppoſits thereof.</p>
               <p>That humility relateth to this Command, and is comprehended under it, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 3. And is a grace ſo neceſſary and uſeful to Chriſtians, that it ought eſpecially to be headed and taken notice of. It may be conſidered in a threefold reſpect, 1. In reſpect of God, this humility ought to be in reaſonable creatures to God as their Creator, they being nothing, and leſs then nothing before him, and uſeful or gainful for nothing to him. 2. It may be conſidered as it reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth others, and that not in a complementing manner, but as it comprehendeth our humbling of our ſelves in our carriage towards them, and from the ſenſe of our short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming of them, and being inferiour to them in ſome things wherein we preferr them to our ſelves, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 3. 3. It may be conſidered not only as it moderateth us in our common carriage towards God, or towards our Neighbour, but alſo as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth our ſelves, for by it we are kept within bonds, as to our thoughts of our ſelves, and what is ours, or in us, upon the diſcovery of many infirmities we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
               <p>Humility conſidered the firſt way, is not properly contained under this Command, but cometh in under the firſt Command of the firſt Table, but <hi>humility</hi> in the two laſt reſpects, as it moderateth our thoughts and eſteem of our ſelves, and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ight reaſon in reference to others or our ſelves, cometh in here, and is enjoyned in this command; and concerning it theſe following things are to be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thus Humility of one man towards another differeth from Humility towards God, becauſe of the great diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oportion that is between God and Creatures, infinitely more then any that is amongſt Creatures themſelves, there is in nothing compariſon to be made with God, neither is there any poſſibility of profiting him, <hi>Job</hi> 25. 7. but there may be comparing and uſefulneſs too, amongſt Creatures which this humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity taketh not away, ſee <hi>Job</hi> 29. throughout the Chapter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Humility is not oppoſite to magnanimity, boldneſs and zeal, but is well conſiſtent with theſe, as is clear in Chriſt, the Apoſtles and others of the Saints; for boldneſs and magnanimity is an adventuring in Chriſts ſtrength upon what one is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to according to warrantable grounds; and humility, although it leadeth us to entertain due thoughts of our own infirmities, yet it moderateth us in that alſo accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to right reaſon, ſo that the exerciſe of both being to be ordered according to this rule of reaſon, as the call, occaſion, object, and particular circumſtances shall require; It is evident that there is no inconſiſtencie betwixt the two, but that they may very well be in one and the ſame perſon and at one and the ſame time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From this we may ſee, That Humility differeth from, as is ſomewhat elſe then fainting and deſpondencie of ſpirit or penſive puſillanimity, in not daring to fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>low a call in reference to ſome ſeemingly difficult action; now humility being the vertue acting according to reaſon, this is the exceſs without and againſt reaſon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as humility and zeal are commended, ſo this want of valiantneſs for truth, when called for, or baſeneſs of ſpirit, is complained of as a ſin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 3. and <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 4. 10, 14, and <hi>Jeremiah chap.</hi> 1. 6. are reproved for ſome degree of it: for in every difficult good which men would aim at (and the moſt deſirable good things amongſt men are often moſt difficult) there are two things conſiderable, 1. There is a <hi>bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m,</hi> or a good thing which is deſirable; as for example, to do ſome exploit, to undergo ſome change, &amp;c. now men being bent to be ambitious, covetons, raſh, &amp;c. to attain ſuch a good, <hi>humility</hi> moderating their deſires and deſigns according to their capacity and abilities, and bridling that exceſs upon the one hand, is of great advantage.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:31633:120"/>
There is again in the ſecond place, in attaining ſuch things, a difficulty, by which we are in hazard to be ſcared from, and fainted in following of duty, and zeal and magnanimity guard againſt this, ſuſtaining the man, and keeping him from falling into diſcouragement, or puſillanimous penſiveneſs, which is the defect upon the other hand.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This humility, as a grace, differeth from civility and outward yielding to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, becauſe. 1. It proceedeth from a principle of conſcience, and upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious account, <hi>viz.</hi> the inward ſenſe and feeling of the defect of grace in our ſelves, and the impreſſion of our Neighbours worth. 2. It is ſingle, without any approved deſign of pleaſing men, or any other conſideration, but purely upon the forementioned account.</p>
               <p>This is the grace of <hi>humility,</hi> with which the beſt Moraliſts among the Heathen, were nothing acquainted; they had indeed their moral vertues, as remaining ſparks of natures light, and dark reſemblances of ſome Goſpel graces, which neve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, wanting the principle of Faith, without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, and not being directed to the right end, the glory of God, could not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him. But beſides this imperfection and defectiveneſs in their wiſdom and way, the Goſpel having a far more high and noble deſign, then they could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, hath alſo graces, that are wholly peculiar to it: The work and end of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy, could be no other, then to moderate paſſions, and regulate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in ſuch a conformity to reaſon, as might give unto a man, void of all ſenſe of his diſtance and alienation from God, an in ward lying tranquility, and outward tranſient peace, whereas, the project and ſcope of the Goſpel, is quite another thing, <hi>vez</hi> to reconcile, and ſavel oſt ſinners, through faith in Chriſt, and in him, to make them partakers of holineſs here, and glory and happineſs hereafter: Hence it is, that as the Goſpel doth, by renewing and ſanctifying, wholly change the old appearances of vertues into ſolid graces, flowing from Chriſt the fountain, and referred to God as their true end; ſo doth it alſo require and beſtow its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per graces, ſuch as Repentance. Faith, Humility, and many other, unto which theſe Moraliſts were altogether ſtrangers And as to this humility, it is certain, that the Goſpel, by diſcovering unto us, the loſt and wretched condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into ſin had ruined us, and the free and wonderful love, whereby we are delivered out of it, doth agreeably to this command, teach us a lowlineſs and ſelf-denyal, ſo unlike to any thing in the doctrine of theſe old Moraliſts, that it is not more proper to the ſpirit of the Goſpel, then it's contrary pride, may be called their Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtick, in as much as it is evident, that theſe ſelf improvers of ſelf, became alſo ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>magnifiers, to that pitch of arrogancie, that <hi>Lucretius</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> in the name of their moſt famous Sects, indeavoured by argument to extoll thier ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man, even above their Gods; and the beſt of them would have accounted Chriſtian humility an unworthy and baſe abjection of ſpirit; but neither are theſe the only men tainted with this evil; the ſin of pride is ſo plainly the ruin of all that are without God, and the neck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>break of all that ſeek after righteouſneſs, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes then by Faith, that we may well affirm. Humility to be Faiths inſeparable companion; Nowonder then that there is no grace more commended to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and more neceſſary; which might appear by conſidering, 1.

Neither 2. vaunteth it ſelf when it paſſeth by wrongs, and forgiveth them, or when it doth &amp; ſuffereth any other thing commendable, it thinketh not of it ſelf above what is meet, but ſoberly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. 3. After acts of charity, the right hand knoweth not, as it were, what the left hand hath given, it forgetteth good works, as to any ſelf eſteem of them (which pride remembreth and keepeth as it were a regiſter of) but aſcribeth all to Grace, <hi>Not I, but grace in me,</hi> ſaith the humble man with <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 3. 5. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10.</p>
               <p>In a word, this humility is extenſive to every thing in a mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portement as a man, and to all duties which concern him as a Chriſtian, whether in reference to the worſhip of God, or the doing duty to men, even as on the contrary, pride, ſelf-conceit, and preſumption are very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, and immix themſelves in all that a man doth, and are as the dead flies that make all to ſtink.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:31633:121"/>
And as it is commendable, likewiſe it is very neceſſary as to many things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as 1. In external things, that relate to our converſing with others, it is neceſſary as to a mans credit ànd juſt reputation; the <hi>proud man</hi> is often in Gods righteous Judgment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed; Then it is neceſſary for things relating to our ſelves, as for our entertaining peace with God, for keeping us within bonds, for guarding againſt ſnairs, for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up communion with God, and for fitting to the ſuitable diſcharge of all duties call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; It would make us preach, and you hear more profitably; it would ſettle and eſtablish againſt the reelings that are in this time, that put many into a diſtemper, and a ſort of ſpititual diſtraction and madneſs, it is the <hi>humble that God giveth grace to, to whom he revealeth his ſecret,</hi> who have largeſt promiſes and commendations, &amp;c. Let us therefore learn to be humble and ſober, without affecting to be wiſe above what is meet, this grace of humility in the lively exerciſe of it, is in a ſpecial manner called for by the Lord at this time, of the reeling and falling of many, the want whereof uſeth to precede and prediſpoſe for a fall.</p>
               <p>To cloſe this we shall only add, That wherever there may be a <hi>pride,</hi> there is alſo an <hi>humility</hi> oppoſite to it. Man may be proud in reſpect of outward things, as of eſtate, riches, deſcent, employment, &amp;c. And alſo in reſpect of things of the mind, yea even of ſpiritual things: As, 1. of parts and gifts, as knowledge, quickneſs of wit, fruitfulneſs of invention, &amp;c. 2. Of Graces and holineſs. 3. Of experience, eminent manifeſtations, ſpiritual exerciſes, &amp;c. wherewith God may make ſome to shine very far above and beyond others. 3. A man may be proud of ſome good deeds done by him, wherein poſſibly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God hath made him ſomewhat more then ordinarily inſtrumental. 4. There is a proud curioſity leading to ſeek after the knowledge of ſecret things, or of things too high for us, or of things revealed and competent for us to know in another way then God hath allowed, or leading men to adventure and ſtep further then they are called, which is condemned by the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 21. where he forbiddeth the people to break through and gaze: Now there is to <hi>pride,</hi> in all theſe reſpects, an oppoſit <hi>humility,</hi> which maketh a man walk ſoftly, and eſteem ſoberly of himſelf, notwithſtanding of any difference God hath made betwixt him and others in what thing ſoever, and to wait till his mind and will be made known in his own way, and by inſtruments made choiſe of by himſelf, and puteth on to ſerious endeavours of practiſing it when known; which pride doth not. Thus we ſee both how exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and how neceſſary to Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in whatſoever ſtat on they are, this excellent grace of humility is, which is a ſpecial ornament of Chriſtians, and a notable piece of beautiful conformity to meek and lowly Jeſus.</p>

I have mentioned appeals to Duels under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer branch, becauſe albeit that in the matter of private duels the pride and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of men do ordinarily either commend a vain bravery and gallantry; or pretend the excuſes of a ſeeming Obligation in the point of honour or neceſſary defence: Yet we are ſure that the judgment of God, which is according to truth, by pointing out on the part as well of the accepter as of the appealer; theſe enſuing irregularities, do condemn the thing as exceeding ſinful.

opprobrious ſpeeches, chartallings &amp; challenges to fight, &amp;c. but alſo 6. By evil example, as <hi>David</hi> was acceſſary to the ſin of the Adverſaries blaſphemous reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by what he did, and the Apoſtle often inſinuateth Chriſtians may be thus guilty by their inſutable deportment in the ſeveral relations they ſuſtain and ſtand under, this may alſo be by doing what hath the appearance of evil, yea even by doing of things in themſelves lawful but inexpedient, becauſe unſeaſonable and with offence. Thus one Chriſtian may be acceſſory to anothers ſtumbling, and may ſinfully hazard the deſtroying of theſe for whom Chriſt dyed, as the Apoſtle diſcourſeth concerning offences even in things not ſinful in themſelves: 7. By not warning faithfully before ſin be committed, as is clear, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 18. 8. By not reproving after the ſin is committed, but ſuffering it to lye on our brother, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 6. 9. By not ſuiting and proportioning the reproof to the greatneſs of the ſin, but making it too ſoft and gentle, not shewing juſt indignation againſt it, which was <hi>Eli</hi> his guilt, who though he did not altogether neglect or omit to reprove the prophanity and groſs wickedneſs of his Sons, yet did not reprove at that rate of holy ſeverity, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and anſwerable to, their atrocious and villanous wickedneſs, he <hi>frowned</hi> not on them and dealt not roughly with them, as he should have done, as is clear by comparing 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 22. 23. 24. 25. with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 13. 10. By rash putting men in Offices for which they are not all, or not competently qualified, and ſo cannot but in all probability ſin much in them, eſpecially in the Office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22, 11. By not endeavouring by all ſuitable and lawful means within the compaſs of our power and calling to prevent the ſin of others, and to reſtrain them from it, as <hi>Eli</hi> is on this account challenged by the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 13. 12. By broaching, venting, teaching and ſpreading hereſies and falſe doctrine; thus <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is notoriouſly and primely guilty of this ſin of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther; as all falſe teachers and ſeducers are leſs or more according to the nature of the doctrine taught by them and their induſtry in propagating the ſame; and likewiſe all that tolerate and do not reſtrain them, whoſe Office obligeth them to it according to their power: All theſe and other ways may men be acceſſory to other mens ſins, and ſo make themſelves guilty of this great and cruel ſin of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther.</p>
               <p>This ſort of murther aboundeth and is very rife, and yet is in an eſpecial manner forbidden by this command, and the prevention of it accordingly called for, it being a greater evidence of love to our neighbour to be careful of his ſoul then of his body, the one being more pretious then the other; and however falſe Prophets, teachers and ſeducers, ſeem ordinarily to be moſt tender of mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and moſt deſirous to pleaſe them, yet are they in this ſort horridly guilty of their murther.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a life of contentment, conſiſting in the tranquillity of the mind, and the calm frame of a quiet ſpirit with comfort, joy and chearfulneſs; to this purpoſe ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>I live if ye ſtand faſt in the Lord,</hi> and it is ſaid of <hi>Jacob Gen.</hi> 45. 27. when he heard that <hi>Joſeph</hi> lived, <hi>his ſpirit revived,</hi> as if it had been dead before, becauſe of his great heavineſs, ariſing from the ſuppoſed death of his Son; thus we become guilty of this Sin of <hi>killing,</hi> when we obſtruct or interrupt the ſpiritual comfort and joy, or the inward contentment of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by fear, heavineſs, diſquietneſs, diſcouragement, &amp;c. whereby his life is made bitter, and his tranquillity impaired, and ſo his hurt procured or furthered: As <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren did not only become guilty of his blood, but of weighting
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:31633:123"/>
their Father, and deadning, as it were, his ſpirit, which afterwards at the news of <hi>Joſepths</hi> being alive revived, ſo people may be guilty againſt their Miniſters, when they make them do their work not with joy but grief, as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
               <p>Again Murther, as it reſpecteth the bodily life of our Neighbour, is either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, as <hi>Cains</hi> was of <hi>Abel, Joahs</hi> of <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa.</hi> or mediate, as <hi>Sauls</hi> was of the Lords Prieſts, <hi>Davids</hi> of <hi>Uriah, and Achabs</hi> of <hi>Naboth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, killing may be conſidered either as purpoſed, ſuch as <hi>Cain's</hi> was of <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Joab's</hi> of <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa,</hi> or not purpoſed; which again is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: 1. Innocent, which is even by the Law of God every way ſo, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no breach of this Command: as when a man, following his duty, doth that which beſide, &amp; contrary to his intention, &amp; without any previous neglect or overſight in him, proveth the hurt &amp; death of another. 2. Culpable, bcauſe although it do proceed beyond the purpoſe of the perſon, yet it is occaſioned and cauſed by a culpable negligence: As ſuppoſe one were hewing with an Ax, which he either knew, or might have known to be looſe, and the head not well faſtened to the helve, did not advertiſe thoſe about him of it, if by flying off, it happend to wound or kill any perſon, he were not innocent, but if without any inadvertencie, he either knew not that it were looſe, or that any were about him, if then it ſhould fall off and kill his Neighbour, in this caſe he is guiltleſs: So when the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thoſe who built houſes to build battlements about the roofs of them if any perſon fell where the battlements were, the Maſter was free; if the battlements were not he was guilty.</p>
               <p>Murther is alſo either to be conſidered, as committed after provocation, or without all provocation, which is a great aggravation of the ſin, though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation maketh it not ceaſe to be a ſin. Further, it may be conſidered, as it is the murther of evil and wicked men, or of good and religious men, and that on the account of their Religion, which is a moſt horrid aggravation of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this murther, is either ordinary, as of meer equals, or inferiours; or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarly, aggredged by the quality of the perſon murthered, whether he be a ſupperiour, as a Magiſtrate, a Parent; or whether he be of a near Relation, as a Brother, or Kinſman, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We come a little more particularly to conſider the extent &amp; nature of the ſin for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden here (which is not certainly to be underſtood of taking the life by publick Juſtice, or in a lawful or juſt War, or in neceſſary and pure ſelf-defence that we may the better underſtand the contrary duty commanded: It implyeth then a <hi>hurting,</hi> which we may conſider, 1. as in the heart, 2. as in the mouth or words, 3. as in geſtures, 4. as in deeds; for we take it for granted that it reacheth further then the groſs outward act, as by Chriſts expoſition of it in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. is incontrovertibly clear.</p>
               <p>The heart is the fountain, ſpring, and treaſure of all evil, in it breedeth all evil, and from it proceedeth this murther, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 19. he that in heart hateth his brother is a murtherer. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3 15.

               <p>THE Lord having ſpoken of ſuch ſins as do more reſpect mans being ſimply in the former Command, he cometh now to direct in thoſe things that concern a man in his life, in the ordering of his converſation; and as it will be found one way or other, that by our paſſion, hatred, and anger, in one degree or other, the former Command isi broken often, ſo this ſin (that in the very name of it is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable) is not ſo unfrequent, even amongſt Chriſtians, as might in all reaſon be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and expected.</p>
               <p>The vile ſin of inordinate Concupiſcence and Luſt entred into Mankind exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing early after <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, and in nothing the bitter fruit of Original ſin, and that pravity of our nature ſooner kyeths, and did kyth, then in it: Hence is it that <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Evahs</hi> nakedneſs, and their being ashamed, is ſpoken of in Scripture, which implyeth a ſinfulneſs and inordinateneſs in them, which formerly they were not tainted with; as alſo a shame or plague following upon it: and this corrupt nature being ſtill in man, it is hard to ſpeak of, or to hear theſe things holily; and therefore there is a neceſſity both of holineſs and wiſdom here, leſt we break this Command, even when ſpeaking of it, and hearing it ſpoke of; yet the breach of it being a ſin ſo rife, and the Spirit in Scripture thinking it needful to ſpeak of it, yea, it being put in a particular and diſtinct Command by it ſelf, and our moſt holy and bleſſed Lord Jeſus having himſelf commented on it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. there is a neceſſity of ſaying ſomewhat of it, but ſo as to contain within the bounds of Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: O! be therefore afraid of ſinning in hearing; remember and conſider that the Lord ſeeth, and in a ſpecial manner abhorreth ſuch vile Imaginations as shall be irritated and excited even from his holy command enjoyning the contrary, which is indeed both an evidence and a part of the <hi>ſinfulneſs of ſin,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To take therefore a view of it, let us conſider the ſcope of the Command, which we conceive is in a ſpecial manner, and obviouſly holden forth in theſe few places of Scripture, commending holineſs in reſpect of a mans perſon, and condemning</hi> uncleanneſs <hi>in all its branches. 1</hi> Theſſ. <hi>4.</hi> v. <hi>3, 4 5. 7.</hi> For this is the will of God, even your ſanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication, that every one of you should know how to poſſeſs his veſſel in ſanctification and honour, not in the luſt of concupiſcence, even as the Gentiles, which knew not God—for God hath not called us unto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, but unto holineſs, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 3. 4. 5.</hi> But fornication, and all uncleanneſs, or covetouſneſs, let it not be once named amongſt you, as becometh Saints: Neither filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not fooliſh talking, nor jeaſting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:31633:124"/>
For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean perſon, nor covetous man who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Chriſt and of God. <hi>Galat. 5. 19.</hi> Now the works of the flesh are manifeſt, which are theſe, adultery, fornication, uncleanneſs, laſciviouſneſs. <hi>Rom. 13. v. 13.</hi> Let us walk honeſtly as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenneſs, not in chambering and wantonneſs, not in ſtrife and envying. <hi>Coloſſ. 3. v. 5.</hi> Mortifie therefore your members, which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanneſs, inordinate affection, evil concupiſcence, and covetouſneſs which is idolatry. <hi>In which places, as we ſee, the ſin forbidden in this Command, held out under the Moſt odious deſignations, to wit, a</hi> work of the flesh, fornication, adultery, uncleanneſs, laſci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>If we might be particular, we could shew how there is no Command more preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, more fully explained, and ſorer plagued in the breach of it, then this, and ſet forth with more aggravating expreſſions, to make it ſo much more abominable.

So did it in <hi>Solomon,</hi> and therefore the man given to it is compared to an <hi>Oxe</hi> and a <hi>Fool, Prov.</hi> 7. 22. 23, &amp;c. It is compared alſo to the <hi>neighing of Horſes, Jer.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. and the <hi>hire of a whore,</hi> and the <hi>price of a dogg,</hi> are put together, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 18. The madneſs, folly, yea and, to ſay ſo, devillry and bewitching power of it are ſet out in <hi>Jezabel.</hi> It is ſaid to be, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>A work of darkneſs, that bringeth Gods wrath on the children of diſobedience,</hi> as it did bring it on <hi>Sodom</hi> the <hi>Old world,</hi> and the <hi>Canaanites</hi> moſt ſignally; and ſeldom is there a remarkable plague and punishment brought on a Perſon or Land, but this ſin of vileneſs hath a main hand in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of it; and where it reigneth, it is uſually, if not alwayes, accompanied with many other groſs ſins, which are occaſioned by it, and given way to for its ſake, as <hi>drunkenneſs, murther, idolatry,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For further clearing of this Command, conſider 1. The <hi>Species</hi> or kinds of faults condemned in it, and the vertues or graces commended. 2. The manner of being guilty of the breach of it, which (becauſe this Command will be found to be ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual as the other commands are) reacheth to the heart and affections as they do. 3. Conſider the ſin here forbidden in its incitements, ſoments, and other ſins more implicitely comprehended under it, as <hi>idleneſs glutony, drunkenneſs, impudencie, gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and unchaſtneſs in apparel or nakedneſs, dancing, ſinging of bawdy ſongs, looſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or fellowship,</hi> and every appearance of this ill, and what may lead to it, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or is an evidence of it. 4. See its oppoſite vertues, and the means uſeful for the ſubduing of it, as <hi>chaſtity, modeſty, shamefacedneſs, temperance, lawful marriage,</hi> the remedy thereof, &amp;c. which are required in this Command, and are very uſeful for a holy life.</p>
               <p>That theſe things ought to be ſpoken of, none will deny; that they belong to one of the Commands, the perfection of the Law requireth it; and that they come in here under this Command, the nature of them, and their conjunction with, or influence upon the ſin condemned, or duty commanded here, will make evident; the ſin of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery being a prime branch of the carnalneſs of our nature, under it the reſt of that kind are comprehended for making of them the more odious.</p>

Thus men and women may begin their marriage carnally, by wooing carnally, which will make them guilty, although there be no more: Marrying with perſons of a different Religion or with other unſuitable diſparities, maketh guilty of the breach of this Command, that ſort of marriage not being the lawful remedy of Fornication; or when we are ſweyed more with temporal ends, and with reſpect to the ſatisfying of fleſhly Luſts, then with conſcientious reſpect to what God allows, and right reaſon requires, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all to Gods glory; for this thwarteth with the end of marriage, and doth tranſchange marriage into a cloak for covering covetouſneſs or filthineſs, and ſo before marriage there may be guilt.</p>

               <p>This inordinateneſs may be in reſpect of frequencie, unſeaſonableneſs, carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the manner; and what need is there to ſay more?

Though exceſs in this alſo is to be guarded againſt, but when there are times of trouble, and of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or publick calamity, wherein the Bridegroom is called to come out of his Chamber; in ſuch times as theſe, married perſons may be readily guilty of inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinateneſs: And it is known that there were, upon ſome occaſions, reſtraints under the Law when a man might not touch a woman, thought his own Wife, to ſhew that in conjugal Society men ſhould obſerve a purity, &amp; that they have not under limited liberty in this, more then in other things as eating, drinking, &amp;c.

Therefore we chooſe to ſpeak a word to theſe two evils here, which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo abominable, and yet, alas! ſo frequent amongſt thoſe who are called Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>It is true, there is both in eating and drinking, reſpect to be had, 1. To nature, which in ſome requireth more, in ſome leſs: 2. To mens ſtations, where, as to the kind or quality (as we ſaid of cloaths) there is more allowed to one then another: 3. To ſome occaſions, wherein more freedom and hilarity is permitted then at other times, when more abſtinency and a reſtraint upon theſe, even in themſelves lawful pleaſures, is extraordinarily called for, ſo that we cannot bound all perſons, and at all times, with the ſame peremptory rules.</p>
               <p>There is alſo reſpect to be had to <hi>Chriſtian liberty,</hi> where, by Gods goodneſs, men have allovvance to make uſe of theſe things, not only for neceſſity, but for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing alſo, and the vertue of temperance and ſobriety (as all other vertues) doth not conſiſt in an indiviſible point, ſo that a man is to eat and drink ſo much, and neither leſs nor more, without any latitude; the Lord hath not ſo ſtreightned the conſciences of his people, but hath left bounds in ſobriety, that we may come and go upon, providing theſe bounds be not exceeded. Neither is every ſatisfaction or delight in meat or drink to be condemned (ſeeing it is natural) but ſuch as degenerateth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh carnal.</p>
               <p>We would therefore inquire into the ſinfulneſs thereof, and becauſe there is a great affinity betwixt theſe two evils of <hi>Gluttony</hi> and <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> we may ſpeak of them together for brevities ſake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>we ſuppoſe then, 1. That both</hi> gluttony <hi>and</hi> drunkenneſs <hi>are ſinfull; and that both in the uſe of meat and drink men may ſeveral wayes fail: the many prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and commands that are in the Word, for ordering us in the uſe of meat and drink, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>10. 31.</hi> VVhether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.

So to <hi>be given to wine,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 3. and to <hi>look on it with delight,</hi> when it moveth it ſelf aright in the cup, &amp;c. is condemned, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23, 31.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="6">6.

               <p n="7">7. Conſider eating and drinking in their <hi>circumſtances,</hi> and ſo ſometimes meat and drink ſomewhat beyond ordinary, and chearfulneſs in the uſe of them, are allowable: Sometimes again abſtinencie is called for, and though no particular time be ſet for abſtaining from meat and drink, or for faſting, but God hath left that to mens prudence; yet it cannot be denyed but when one will at no time want din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

               <p n="8">8. Eating and drinking may be conſidered as to the <hi>expences</hi> we beſtow on what we eat and drink, and the affection we have to them, or delight in them, ſpoken of; as alſo in reſpect of the <hi>time</hi> we ſpend on them.

               <p n="9">9. Conſider eating and drinking as a mean ſeaſonably made uſe of for its <hi>end,</hi> as <hi>strength,</hi> or <hi>health</hi> and the <hi>honour of God,</hi> or as an <hi>end it ſelf,</hi> or without reſpect to another end; and thus it is ſinful, <hi>Eccleſs.</hi> 10 16. 17. and the Land is curſed that hath Princes that keep not the bounds allowed; which implyeth that the uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of meat or drink, without reſpect to its <hi>end,</hi> and that in <hi>due ſeaſon</hi> (as God giveth all things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 15. and as we ſhould pray for all things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6) is a breach and exceſs.</p>

               <p>What hath been ſaid agreeth both to ſins of drinking and eating: We ſhall now give ſome general rules, the obſerving whereof will further diſcover the ſins that are in the uſe of meat and drink, either in the <hi>exceſs</hi> or <hi>defect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is, we ſhould look to a <hi>right end,</hi> both in eating and drinking, which is threefold: 1 <hi>Supream, Eat and drink to the glory of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 30. thus we may ſin either in the <hi>defect</hi> or <hi>exceſs,</hi> by diſinabling our ſelves for any duty of his worſhip or, by not adverting to this end; this rule therefore faith, we ſhould be ſo ſwayed in <hi>quality, quantity, time,</hi> &amp;c. of our eating and drinking, as we may moſt glorifie God. 2. <hi>Subordinate,</hi> and ſo we ought to have a reſpect to others in all theſe; hence it is that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 20. there is a <hi>woe</hi> to him that eateth with <hi>offence:</hi> thus by frequenting <hi>Taverns,</hi> though we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not in drinking, we ſtrengthen others to follow our example to a greater length; or it giveth them occaſion to misjudge and miſconſtruct us; ſo alſo the uſing of unlawful enjoyments in a too carnal and joval a way, before carnal men give them occaſion to think that we place ſome happineſs in theſe things, as they do. 3. Our own <hi>strengthening</hi> and <hi>refreſhing</hi> is an end to be looked to in the uſe of meat and drink, and ſo when we weaken and indiſpoſe our ſelves by them, we ſin, againſt this end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the act it ſelf of eating and drinking, if it be exceſſive for the <hi>kind</hi> of meat or drink, as <hi>too delicate,</hi> &amp;c. or for the <hi>quantity, too much,</hi> or for the <hi>time</hi> that is ſpent, <hi>too long,</hi> &amp;c. it is ſinful.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:31633:132"/>
3. Conſider the manner, If creature enjoyments be with delight ſought for, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively delighted in, and folks become reſtleſs and anxious about them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 25. and too eager in purſuing theſe things, and too much taken up with them, ſo that the ſeeking after them marreth contentment and the quiet frame of the mind, then there is ſinful exceſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider the <hi>effects</hi> in diverſe reſpects; 1. In reſpect of a mans <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ward eſtate</hi> or <hi>family,</hi> and ſo a man ſinneth when he eateth or drinketh beyond that which he may uphold, or his condition in the world will allow, and when his eating or drinking ſo, may make himſelf or his wife and children faſt for it afterward, or to be much pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2. In reſpect of his <hi>calling,</hi> if it divert a man from that, and marr the work in his hand, and make him break appointments ſet by him for finiſhing of other mens work, which he might other wayes have kept, and much more if it indiſpoſe him for ſpeaking of, or doing that which concerneth his calling, it is then ſure in the exceſs. 3. In reference to his <hi>body,</hi> if it be weakned, dulled, or indiſpoſed by the exceſs of meat or drink: This is called <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>inflaming of them,</hi> and is not allowable. 4. Look to it as it affecteth folks <hi>reaſon,</hi> and in leſs or more indiſpoſeth them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or judge of things aright; much more when it raiſeth a fury or madneſs, and maketh them as reaſonleſs beaſts in their carriage, it is exceſſive and to be eſchewed no doubt. 5. Look on it in reference to the <hi>ſpiritual duties</hi> of a mans chriſtian calling, as of <hi>praying, reading, hearing, repenting,</hi> &amp;c. the obligation to theſe dutis laying on alway, and our refreshments being in themſelves midſes to lead to the more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful performance of them, when by them we become more indiſpoſed for them, ſo as either to forbear them, or to be formal or drouſie in them; that is ſure not good, but to be evited. 6. Look to it in reference to the <hi>ſerious inward frame of the mind,</hi> which theſe should have who ought to walk alwayes with God, keep communion with him, and be filled with the ſpirit, whatſoever marreth that or obſtructeth ſpiritul conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or is inconſiſtent with it, cannot certainly be good: Hence <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>to be filled with the ſpirit,</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>exceſs in wine or drunkenneſs,</hi> ſo that what is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the one, may be underſtood as belonging to the other, and although this ſenſible joy of the ſpirit cannot be alwayes carried alongſt, yet none should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitate themſelves for keeping up with it. 7. Look on it in reference to <hi>our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi> and the promoving of mortification; when it either marreth this, by dulling and weakning of the graces of the ſpirit, or indiſpoſing for their exerciſe; or ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and provoketh the former, it cannot be but ſinful, being a <hi>feeding of the flesh, a making of proviſion for the flesh,</hi> as if we foſtered our corruptions of lazineſs, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, and other luſts, when we feaſt our ſelves. 8. Look on it with reſpect to its oppoſite, <hi>ſobriety</hi> and <hi>temperance;</hi> what is not ſobriety, is exceſs, and contrarily; and ſobriety being not only no exceſs, but a denyed ſober uſe of creatures, there muſt be exceſs when the mind, as well as the body, is not ſober, in the uſe of theſe things, 9. Look on it with reſpect to its <hi>end</hi> (with which we began) when it lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to, and fitteth not for <hi>honouring of God,</hi> when it marreth our being uſeful to our relations and others, either by taking up our time, or ſpending our means that we cannot provide for them, and ſupply them or indiſpoſeth us for duties, or hindereth a man from conſidering his own laſt end, thus it is ſinfully exceſſive. 10. Look on it in reference to <hi>death</hi> and <hi>Chriſts ſecond appearing,</hi> for certainly our frame and poſture in every thing should be ſuch as we may not be ſurpriſed with that: Hence is Chriſts warning, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34. <hi>Take head that ye be not overcharged with ſurfetting, gluttony, and drunkenneſs, and the cares of this life, and that day come upon you unawares:</hi> where he maketh not only <hi>the coming of the Lord,</hi> an aw-band
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:31633:132"/>
to keep from groſs out-breaking into theſe ſins; but joyning them with the <hi>carts of the world,</hi> he sheweth that there may be, and oft is, an indiſpoſition for that day e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the inward frame of the mind, occaſioned by ſenſual inclinations and deſires, when nothing doth outwardly appear.</p>
               <p>Now put what hath been ſaid to tryal, and ye will find that it is not only he who by ſurcharging himſelf ſtaggereth, vomiteth, or hath no uſe of reaſon, who in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is accounted guilty of theſe evils; but many more, as will be ſadly evident when the Lord cometh to count with them; and if he should call many to this reckoning at the time of their eating or drinking, it would be a terrible ſurpriſal to them: It is marked <hi>(Matth.</hi> 24. 39.) as an evidence of the ſenſuality and ſecurity of the old world, that they continued eating and drinking, and knew not till the flood came; and it is more terrible and ſad what the Lord ſaith afterward, <hi>So shall it be at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Son of Man.</hi> O! fear and think ſeriouſly of this when ye are at your cups, and after them, and do not imagin that you are never guilty, but when you are like to beaſts void of reaſon; for the Scripture condemning drunkenneſs, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth under it all exceſs in drinking, and that which may indiſpoſe for going about what we are called to, though the exerciſe of our reaſon be not alwayes diſturbed. Neither to conſtitute drunkenneſs is it needful, that the perſon willingly and purpoſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend drunkenneſs, it is enough that he willingly drink (and his will cannot be ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forced) although he be not deſirous that theſe effects should follow; for it is the <hi>act</hi> and not the <hi>effect</hi> which is properly the ſin, as is ſaid: If there were any thing of the fear of God, or ſenſe of duty, or shame of dishoneſty, there would not need many motives to diſſwade from theſe evils; by committing of which moſt holy men have brought ſad things on themſelves, and occaſioned ſad curſes to their children, as in <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> is clear; and therefore their examples and falls are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be imitated, or made uſe of to diminish from the account men ought to have of the greatneſs of the guilt, as they often alas are, that they are ſet up as beacons to ſcare and fright from them.</p>
               <p>What ſort of perſons it doth worſt become, is not eaſſe to determine, it being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming to every perſon, yea even beaſtly and againſt nature, men being by it not only put for a time from the exerciſe of their reaſon (as it is in ſleep) but incapacitate to act it, and put in a contrary beaſtly fury. How unbecoming is it for <hi>old men,</hi> that should be examples to others in ſobriety? How unbecoming is it to <hi>young <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en,</hi> whoſe youth should be otherwayes exerciſed? How unbecoming for <hi>mean men,</hi> who ought to be ſober? and how eſpecialy unbecoming is it for men of <hi>place</hi> and <hi>reputation?</hi> upon whom this ſin bringeth diſgrace, and particularly it is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable for <hi>Miniſters</hi> to be given to drink, or to their appetite, to whom the Lord 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. hath given ſpecial rules and directions in this matter; but moſt of all in <hi>wom n</hi> it is abominable, and was and is ſo even amongſt Heathens; In ſum, <hi>whoredom, wine, and new wine, Hoſea</hi> 4. 11. <hi>take away the heart;</hi> and men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manned and made effeminate by them, as was ſaid; yea, are transformed as it were into beaſts; of old, men were ſo ashamed of drunkenneſs, that ſuch as were given to it, betook themſelves ordinarily to the night (though ſome indeed did riſe early in the morning to follow ſtrong drink, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 11.) And when folks will not keep at diſtance at the beginning from this ſin of drunkenneſs, but will needs take a liberty and be chearfull in it, it prevaileth ſadly over them, and maketh them inſlaved beaſts ere long to it, and they become bewitched with it, ſo that they can hardly begot free from the faſcinations and inveiglements of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> laſt.</p>
               <p>If it be asked here, Whether men or women, when health requireth vomiting, may not drink exceſſively for provoking to it, in place of Phyſick?</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That in ſome diſeaſes there is more allowed of ſome ſorts of drink then in health, cannot be denyed: Yea, 2. a difference is to be put betwixt ſorts of drinks; ſome are not inebriating, that is, the drinking of a great quantity of them will not diſturb the uſe of reaſon; others are ſuch that exceſs in them will not only indiſpoſe body and mind, but quite obſtruct and remove the uſe of reaſon and judgement; the firſt ſort of drink (which is more properly phyſical) may lawfully be drunken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in no caſe is it lawful for a man to exceed in the uſe of that drink, which bringeth with it the diſturbance of his reaſon; the reaſon is becauſe this is ſinful in it ſelf, and expreſly againſt Gods command, and defaceth his Image in us (which is in <hi>knowledge)</hi> and is deregatory to it therefore is it ſtill reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a proper <hi>fruit of the fleſh, Gal.</hi> 5. 21. and it ſecludeth from the Kingdom of Heaven, as well as <hi>fornication, theft.</hi> &amp;c. and therefore can no mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Again, this is not the proper end of drink to procure womit (I mean the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ſort of drink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which none ever read of as approved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) beſide, it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth along with it many other ſins, who can tell but when they are in drunkenneſs, they may <hi>blaſpheme, curſe, commit adultery, murther</hi> or ſuch like? ſhould they then actively remove the uſe of their reaſon by a practiſe which may be inductive to ſuch abominations? yea may not death then come? and ſhould it not alwayes be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for? and what a poſture would a man be in, when in ſuch a caſe, to meet death? moreover the diſtemper that followeth ſuch drinking is not ſuch as followeth Phyſick, which doth only make ſick or indiſpoſe the body, and what influence it hath on the brain and reaſon, is but accidental and indirect, but it is otherwayes with that diſtemper that followeth drunkenneſs, which putteth the perſon in ſuch a ſort of fury and diſtraction that the carnal, unrenewed part doth moſt frequently get great advantage by it.</p>
               <p>If it be asked further, What is to be accounted of theſe actions, which are committed in drunkenneſs? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Somewhat was ſaid of this on this on the firſt Command; but further we ſay, 1. Drunkenneſs being a voluntary act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not excuſe, but maketh the perſon doubly guilty, 1. by making the man guilty of ſuch an act, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by drawing on that incapacity on himſelf, whereby he diſpoſed himſelf for that and many more: In this reſpect the perſon committing murther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſinning otherwayes, in drunkenneſs is more guilty then another, who not being in drink committeth the ſame ſin, becauſe two ſins concur in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not in the other: And therefore 2. although the murther, ſwearing, &amp;c. of one that is <hi>freſh</hi> is more groſs murther and ſwearing, &amp;c. in another reſpect becauſe it is more immediately from the exerciſe of deliberation and choice, and that on this ground drunkenneſs may in part extenuate the reſolute pertinaciouſneſs of the fact, yet it aggredgeth guilt upon the perſon on the former account. It was once an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by one, who being deſired to ſpare a perſon that had committed murther in drunkenneſs, and to impute it to his wine: that he ſhould ſo do, but he would <hi>bang up the flagon wherein the wine was;</hi> and ſeeing the man made himſelf ſo, his
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:31633:133"/>
puniſhment was juſt, for had he not been the flagon of that wine, that ſin might have been prevented.</p>
               <p>Let me touch on ſome particular ills, which it is poſſible are more abounding and leſs looked to then beaſtly drunkenneſs, yet hateful to God; and take not I pray the mentioning of them ill, for they will by unſtrained conſequence follow to be condemned by the former rules.</p>
               <p>The 1. is the liberty that is taken by all ſorts of perſons in reſpect of meat; as if only appetite or luſt where their rule, which may be ſeen in that exceſſive and ſuperfluous vanity which is in feaſting, wherein that is ſenſually ſpent, which might be uſefully imployed, and often they that are moſt prodigal and profuſe that way, are leaſt in charity; and if they may pamper their own fleſh, or get the name of Goodfellows and good Houſe-keepers, though it be to ſuch as have no need, and though there be nothing or very little allowed for the ſupply of the neceſſities of the Saints, or of others, and much more with held that way then is meet, yet they think all is well.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is your <hi>tipling,</hi> though ye drink not drunk, your <hi>four hours</hi> (as ye call them) this drinking, as ordinarily uſed, is certainly not for ſtrength, and therefore as is clear, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 16. 17. by the oppoſition there, it muſt be for drunkenneſs. If many men were put to ſearch in this particular, it would be found that there is more expended on theſe in the year, then is beſtowed in charitable uſes; more time taken up in them, then in religious duties, and more inclination to attend them, then to hear ſermons; men cannot come abroad for this end, they cannot ſhift their buſineſs without hurt, but for their company they can do both: <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 29. 30. <hi>Who hath woe? who hath ſorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cauſe? who hath redneſs of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine, they that go to ſeek mixt wine.</hi> Here you ſee who are the perſons that have a woe and Gods curſe on them, and other inconveniencies; are they not the tiplers, even they that tarry long at the ſtrong drink? drink how much or how little they will? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5 22 <hi>Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of ſtrength to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle strong drink.</hi> Certainly God hath made man, and given him time for another end then that, and hath not for that end given his creatures to men to be thus abuſed, this cannot be eating or drinking in due ſeaſon, and I am perſwaded it is not for <hi>neceſſity, for our own health, for the edification of others, or for the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then can be ſaid for it? that it helpeth to paſs the time (which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by many as an excuſe) is a part of its guilt and juſt accuſation, for it mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the time to be loſt, which ought to be more thriftily and carefully ſpent; and what chearfulneſs it is accompanied with is often carnal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when is their ſpiritual diſcourſe, and what may be edifying, and miniſter grace to the hearers at ſuch mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings? when do ye pray for the ſanctifyed uſe of that time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fellow ſhip or drink? if at all it is but ſeldom; many a curſed four-hours is taken by ſome, though all Gods creatures be good, being ſanctified by the word and prayer: be exhorted therefore to forbear this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially ye who have place in government, either Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or Eccleſiaſtick; do not ye make others to offend with your example, nor ſtrengthen theſe in their wickedneſs (to whom ye ſhould be examples of good) incouraging them to go in and drink <hi>drunk in Taverns or Ale houſes,</hi> when they ſee

Beſide that, it hath been obſerved, that ſuch courſes have ſometimes not only made theſe eſtates that were acquired by them, quickly to melt away, but alſo to have been a moth in the eſtates for the time bettered by them. Obſervable: and not altogether aliene from this matter, is that chriſtian and grave Act made againſt Prize-goods in the Town-Councel of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> the head City of this Kingdom, in great Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> his dayes (as one bleſſed fruit of the Goſpel amongſt many others) <hi>May</hi> 10. <hi>An.

               <p>This <hi>Rapine,</hi> again, having a ſort of pretext, becometh <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> when a man by power, favour, or ſuch like, outreacheth and goeth beyond his title, and inda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageth the party with which he contendeth more then his right or title would war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant him to do; &amp; this may be in great men over their inferious, as Maſters over Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, of Landlords over Tenants, of Magiſtrates over People or Subjects; and in all theſe, who any way make uſe of greatneſs to diſtreſs others, or thruſt at them, either to make them quit a right they have, or by retaining from them what is their due or, by exacting them by their title what is really prejudicial to the others property, even though by oppreſſion the perſon be made willing to condeſcend. Thus alſo over-powering of others in <hi>Law ſuits</hi> and <hi>Courts,</hi> and making uſe of monyen to bear them down in their right, is interpreted by God as <hi>Oppreſſion.</hi>

               <p>For the ſecond, to wit, <hi>Theft,</hi> more properly it looketh to all wayes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, without pretext of violence, another is wronged: This is again divided in four.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:31633:137"/>
1. If it be a wrong done to a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> it is called <hi>peculatus,</hi> which in a large acceptation includeth not only private men, or Magiſtrates, ſtealing or robbing the publick treaſure, but alſo Collectors, Queſtors, and others that are in ſuch like offices, who, when they intervert what belongeth to publick uſe, become guilty; and proportionably all ſuch as are intruſted with the keeping and diſtributing of what belongeth to Corporations and Societies, and do intervert it, as <hi>Judas</hi> did in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, when he interverted what was committed to his keeping for uſes not allowed, and therefore he is called a <hi>Thief,</hi> though his crime was alſo Sacriledge. 2. As it reſpecteth any thing appointed for pious uſes, ſo it is called <hi>Sacriledge;</hi> ſee <hi>Lev.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 2, 3. and though now we have nothing that is holy by ſuch a conſecration, yet what is appointed by Gods warrant for holy uſes, cannot without ſin be interverted; ſuch are Churches or houſes built for Gods worship, ſtipends for maintaining of his Miniſters and Ordinances, becauſe theſe belong to the <hi>Church,</hi> as the other do to the <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> ſuch alſo are the poors money, collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. for if their be an appropriation of theſe things for that uſe, then why should that property be incroached on, more then other properties? And if any should ſay theſe are the Magiſtrates gift, and he may uſe them as he pleaſeth? <hi>Anſw.</hi> I am not ſpeaking now of what power the Magiſtrate may have in an extraordinary caſe of neceſſity, there being no doubt times, when particular mens property will not have place, but ought to cede to the publick good; but in ordinary caſes, I ſay, that the right which the Church hath in them, for theſe formentioned uſes or ends, is no leſs then any private mans in his own particular eſtate; beſide that, they are indeed given unto God: And therefore it is not in the Magiſtrates power to make what uſe of theſe he pleaſeth, neither is it at his option to appoint them, and maintain and keep them up, or not, as he pleaſeth, but it is his duty, and that which is required of him to do ſo, as he would be found faithful in the diſcharge of his Office. 3. There is a groſs kind of theft in <hi>men-ſtealing,</hi> not ſo much uſed now, as of old, when there were Slaves, of which men made advantage: This may be alſo in taking or inticing away of another man or womans ſervant, to their Maſters or Miſtreſs prejudice, which is clear theft, though often practiſed, and by many, little regarded: As likewiſe in ſeducing of Children to a falſe Religion, to a bad Marriage, to evil Company, to drinking, whoring robbing, &amp;c. to run away from their Parents out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, without a juſt and neceſſary cauſe, &amp;c. this is condemned in the Law, and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. The 4. ſort is <hi>ſingle theft,</hi> or the wronging of a man in his private and perſonal eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as when a mans money, cloaths, houshold-furniture, corn, horſes, cows, sheep, merchant-wares, books, working-tools, &amp;c. are ſtolen, and privily taken from him. And here do come in the general heads of that <hi>theft</hi> formerly ment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Turpe lucrum,</hi> or <hi>filthy lucre,</hi> is that gain which is acquired either by ſimply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, or by dishoneſt, unworthy, and baſe wayes and means: As, 1. by niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, when a man ſeeks to make great gain of the very leaſt and ſmalleſt things, who uſeth to be called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Cuminibilis,</hi> that is, ſo miſerable a wretch, and ſo baſe a niggard, that he would cut a Cumin-ſeed and ſell it. 2. By taking too largely and greedily when gifts are going, whether to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the giver, or of others ſtanding in no leſs, or in more need, and of no leſs, or it may be, of greater deſerving, thereby incapacitating him to give to them. 3. By a mans proſtituting of himſelf, without all neceſſity, only to win the world, to baſe offices and imployments, diſgracing his ſtation, as for great men to turn to ſuch, whereby they eat as it were the meat out of the mouths of poor men, who have all
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:31633:138"/>
their dayes been bred up in, and followed ſuch imployments' For Miniſters of the Goſpel, in a peaceable ſtate of the Church, and without any neceſſity, to turn to, and deal in worldly Trades; or in a time of trouble to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the very baſeſt of them, when others would do as well, or well enough for their neceſſary maintenance. 4. By vice and villany, as for gain to play the whore, to be a pimp or pander, to keep a ſtew or bawdy-houſe to forſwear or bear falſe witneſs, willingly to ſell drink till men drink to exceſs and be drunk, and to allure and ſollicit them to it, if the drink may but ſo go away, and bring ſome advantage to the Vintner, &amp;c. 5. By ſqueezing, under colour of Law, as by biting Uſury, forging of Writs, by moyen and buds prevailing in law to dwang a man from his right, for a man to buy Pleas, to deal in broken, crazed, or incumbered eſtates that he hath no thing to do with, on deſign to make gain by defrauding Creditors, or forcing them for his own advantage to hurtful compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c. 6. By exceſſive, immoderate and hurtful travel and pains to win a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ery little and inconſiderable thing, and it may be without all neceſſity too. 7. By rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and murther: <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. from <hi>v.</hi> 10. to 20. 8. By ſpoiling the dead, riffling Tombs, taking offerings or linnings, &amp;c. 9. By carding, dicing, and Stage-play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and making conqueſt and gain by any other diſhoneſt or crooked mean.</p>
               <p>Thus we have hinted the firſt diſtribution of inordinateneſs in inquiring into <hi>rapine, theft,</hi> and <hi>unlawful</hi> or <hi>filthy gain.</hi> Conſider it again, 1. As it wrongeth others only, or as it profiteth us alſo: 2. As being direct theft, or as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of Law: 3.

As to the firſt, Conſider it firſt in the <hi>quantity,</hi> it is <hi>theft</hi> whether the matter be in little or much, if ſo be it be a real wronging of others in that which is theirs, even as a <hi>lye</hi> is a lye in any matter, in great things as well as leſſer, and this theft in little or much will ſeclude from the kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 10. and as <hi>drunkenneſs</hi> may be in drink, that is, not the very greateſt quantity of drink, nor in the fineſt drink, ſo may theft be in little or courſe things, Conſider 2. as it looketh not only to the hand, but to the heart alſo, even as adultery and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do; it is a piece of the <hi>evil treaſure</hi> that Chriſt faith is in the heart, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 35. and 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. 19. 3. It may be ſometimes, when he that committeth it, knoweth it not, but ſupponeth ſuch a thing to be juſt and due to him, as when he uſeth not means to know, and when he knoweth, doth not reſtore it. 4. It is ſometimes wholly ſo carried, as that he who is wronged, knoweth nothing of it; as when (for inſtance) ſuch a right that would clear him in his buſineſs is to his prejudice kept up, and he made to believe that he hath no ſuch right, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he quarrel it not, yet it is theft before God. 5. It is direct, when though one knoweth ſuch a thing to be anothers, yet he will needs have it. 6. It is leſs or more, as there is a ſeeming neceſſity, or none at all in the perſon ſtealing; for if the thing be indeed neceſſary for life, it is not theft; ſo alſo if the thing have a general and common allowance among men for its warrant, it is not theft, thus the Diſciples plucked the ears of corn, which was not theirs, and yet were not thieves: The ſin is groſs, when in holy things, or publick things, or when things are taken with violence and hazard of life, blood, &amp;c. or when there is great prejudice following it to our neighbour, or when it is more frequently gone about, or when it is under truſt, &amp;c. 7. It is in contracts or bargains to our neighbours prejudice; as by too cloſe ſticking to clauſes of Writs, beyond, it may be, the intention of the makers, and when there is ſome pretext of Law, this is againſt the end of Writs and Law. 8. It is in buying or ſelling; and ſo, 1. we fail in the end, when we mind our own good only, without any regard to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; 2. In the <hi>matter,</hi> when the thing is not good that is ſold; as the refuſe of wheat that is ſpoken of, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 6. ſo when ye ſell a thing for better then it is, or in buying, will needs make a thing worſe then it is, or pay the price in baſe money, you are guilty of theft: 3. When the meaſure or weight is ſcarce, and not ſo much as it ſhould be; ſee <hi>Amos</hi> 8 5. 4. In the manner, when the buyer diſpraiſeth any thing below, and the ſeller commendeth it beyond and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove its worth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20 14. <hi>It is naught ſaith the buyer,</hi> &amp;c. which although in ſome degree it be inevitable, yet no doubt, when on either hand it is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly and deſignedly done, it is a fault. 9. It may be committed in the matter of juſt debts; As, 1. when nothing is payed; 2. When a part is only payed; 3. when payment is made out of time, which prejudiceth them we owe to, as much as if we kept a part back; 4. when means are uſed to get what we owe dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; 1. by dwanging and conſtraining a man to quit ſome part of it; 2. by deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indirectly to get ſome-thing down of the ſum which we owe 10. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted when advantage is taken of anothers neceſſity, and ſo 1. when they are conſtrained to ſell cheaper, then without loſs they can; 2. when we ſell dearer to our neighbour, becauſe we ſee he muſt have it; 3. when
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:31633:139"/>
neighbour, becauſe we ſee he muſt have it; 3. when one is forced to unreaſonable tearms, becauſe he muſt have money; dealings of this nature are like to that, to fell <hi>the poor for a pair of shooes,</hi> which is reproved <hi>Micah.</hi> 8. 5, 6. 7. and is a groſs theft. It is true, in ſome caſes, as for inſtance, when others would not buy ſuch things, and we need them not our ſelves, neither would buy them, were it not for our neighbours good, and if they be not ſo uſeful for us, an abatement in ſuch a caſe may be lawfully ſought. 11. It may be by <hi>Law-ſuits,</hi> even when Law ſeemeth to ſide with folks, <hi>ſummum jus,</hi> being often, <hi>ſumma injuria;</hi> as 1. by putting folks needleſly to ſue for their own, or by our ſeeking what is not ours; 2. by bearing through a buſineſs to the prejudice of another, upon a title of Law beyond Equity; the firſt is condemned 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. &amp;c. the ſecond in <hi>Job</hi> 31. 21. <hi>If I have liſt up my hand againſt the fatherleſs</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) when I ſaw my help in the gate;</hi> ſee alſo to this purpoſe <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 29. 30. 12. There is a breach of it by wronging our neighbour under truſt (which is a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of theft) As 1. by giving advice to his prejudice, when he lipneth to, and confideth in our counſel; 2. When <hi>Advocates</hi> are not faithful; 3. When <hi>Partners</hi> in trade and bargainings are not faithful one to another; 4. When Servants, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Treaſurers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tc. are not faithful, who, as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> have all committed to them, and like the unjuſt Steward, can count up or down fifty for eighty, and eighty for fifty; 5. Eſpecially here fail Tutors of Orphans and Fatherleſs Children, who having theſe committed to their truſt, make it their work to prey upon their eſtates, if they can but do it handſomly, and without obſervation, this is <hi>theft, robbery, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi> and <hi>deceitful dealing,</hi> in the higheſt degree. 13. There is a breach of it by <hi>bribery,</hi> when Judges ſuffer themſelves to receive gifts, preſents, buds or bribes, whether to the perverting of Judgment, or for doing right in Judgment which they are obliged to do without theſe. Whoever ſuffer themſelves to be bribed for Judging right, may eaſily be tempted by a bribe to do wrong in Judgment; all ſuch forget that the Judgment is the Lords, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 17. that they ought not to judge for men but for the Lord, 2 <hi>Chorn.</hi> 19. 6. that they ought in a ſpecial manner to be fearers of God, men of truth, and haters of couetou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There is a breach of it when there is inequality betwixt our advantage, and that which is expended by us for others, or when for what is not uſeful and needful, their money in truſted to us is exhauſted, or when we occaſion them to ſpend money needleſly, upon any thing that is not uſeful, but rather hurtful, as in exceſſive <hi>drinking, feaſting cloathing,</hi> that is full of vanity, or in vain fashions of cloathing, playing at unlawful games, as <hi>cards</hi> and <hi>dice,</hi> or exceſſively at <hi>unlawful games,</hi> or in <hi>dancing</hi> and <hi>fidling,</hi> and ſuch like, which are amongſt the lavish and profuſe wayes of living, and whoever are acceſſory to make others follow theſe, or for theſe do procure money from others, become thieves. And thus all <hi>idle Vagabonds, Playfairs, Sporters, Minſtrellers, Stage-players,</hi> and ſuch like, livers on other folks charges, are guilty of the breach of this Command. 15. There is a wronging of our Neighbours eſtate by <hi>negligence, ſloath,</hi> &amp;c. when that is not done which we ought to do for their good; this is done eſpecially by Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:31633:139"/>
by Servants, and others, who ſtand in ſuch relations to any, as that by vertue thereof they are obliged to have a care of what they are intereſted in. 16. We wrong others by ingaging them to be ſureties for us, when we ſee not a way how to relieve them. The ingagers themſelves alſo become guilty of the breach of this Command, except in ſuch caſes wherein equity and charity requireth their ingaging, and this way, many are ſtollen from their eſtates. 17 It is committed in retaining what is our neighbours; As, 1. when the payment of money or things borrowed is delayed beyond the time appointed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 28. 2. When things borrowed are hurt or wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Lord giveth Laws for this, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 14. 3. When pledges are loſt by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, or interverted to our own uſe; 4. When our Neighbours beaſt is ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and when ſeen by us, and not kept for him, as we would he should do to us; ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 2. <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 4. 5. When ſomething is loſt, and we keep it, as if finding gave us a right to it; it should be for the right owner, and if he cannot be found, publick ſignification should be made of it, as the Law requireth. 18. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand obligeth us to reſtore, 1. What we have unjuſtly taken from, or gained of others any way, as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 8. It is recorded of <hi>Selymus</hi> the Turkish Emperour, a moſt bloody man, that when he was a dying, one of his Baſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aas deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to build an Hoſpital for relief of the poor, with the wealth taken from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Merchants; he replyed thus, <hi>VVouldeſt thou,</hi> Pyrthus, <hi>that I should beſtow other mens goods, wrongfully taken from them, on works of Charity and Devotion, for mine own vain glory and praiſe? aſſuredly I will never do it; nay, rather ſee they be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the right owners again.</hi> Which was done forthwith accordingly, to the great shame of many Chriſtians, who mind nothing leſs then the reſtitution of ill gotten goods, whether by themſelves, or by their Anceſtours, but cull out ſome ſmall fragments of a world of ſuch ill-gotten goods to beſtow on ſome charitable or pious work, as they call it. <hi>Zacheus</hi> his penitent Proclamation here conſiſted of two branches, to wit, <hi>reſtitution</hi> and <hi>deſtribution.</hi> 2. It obligeth even <hi>Children</hi> that have ſomewhat tranſmitted to them from their <hi>Parents,</hi> which they have unjuſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queished, to reſtore it, otherwayes they make themſelves guilty: And in all theſe we would diſtinguish <hi>the Court of the Lord,</hi> or <hi>of Conſcience,</hi> from mens <hi>Civil Courts,</hi> and thus it will not warrant the Heir before God (though before men it may) to retain that which he poſſeſſeth, that the Father left him a right to what he unjuſtly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed. It may be it is the doing of this which maketh great eſtates melt away in the Childrens hands, becauſe it thus deſcended; the Lord hereby would have men know that they are not richeſt who have moſt left them, but who have it well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queished with Gods bleſſing. 19. Conſider it as it doth not properly take from our neighbours, yet wrongeth them and deteriorateth their eſtate; ſo men may wrong the houſe they dwell in, the horſe they ride on, or any thing which is ſet or given in loan to them; thus they may wrong the inſtruments that others win their living with; ſo alſo we wrong others when their time is taken up either by waiting idly on us, or by unneceſſary imployments put upon them, viſits, and ſuch like; or when weakneſs of body is occaſioned to them by any of theſe, thus <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 19. the Lord will have reparation made for loſt time, as well as for loſt means. Many tiplers are thieves this way, to each other, and to themſelves, which God will make them count for, how little ſoever they think of it. 20. There is a wronging of our neighbour without a <hi>compenſation,</hi> and there is a wronging him with a pertended <hi>compenſation,</hi> that is, either when the thing is not ſo good in it ſelf, or not ſo good to him; thus <hi>Achab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. was guilty in deſiring <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, even though he offered him as good, yet it was not ſo good to <hi>Naboth,</hi> becauſe this was his Fathers, and he
<pb facs="tcp:31633:140"/>
eſteemed it more: Thus alſo there is a ſtealing of another mans contentment, although that in which he placeth it may be a matter of very little or no worth at all, but yet if therein he hath an intereſt of affection, as they call it, ſuch as a man may have for ſome petty Jewel, a Hawk, a Hound, or the like, ſo that it pleaſe him, or delight him, the wronging of him in that, is not only a ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſixth Command, in grieving him, but againſt this in prejudicing him of his contentment, which as to him in ſome reſpect, is a ſorer wrong, then the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from him of that which in it ſelf were of far greater worth, would have been. 21. There is a failing by unskilfulneſs; as when one taketh on him ſome office, and receiv eth wages or hire for it, and is not qualified for, nor ſutable to the place and employment; thus <hi>Phyſicians, Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>Judges,</hi> often ſteal from men, through their ignorance: As alſo <hi>Miniſters</hi> who ſupply Charges they are unfit for, and conſume that which ſhould entertain others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this ſin in Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters is oftentimes more through unfaithfulneſs, when being ſuſtained for the good of the people, they turn rather to be hurtful. Thus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>John</hi> 10. 1. calleth <hi>falſe Prophets, Thieves &amp; Robbers</hi> And indeed it is the worſt gain in the world, that utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unskilful and unfaithful Miniſters get by ſtraving and murthering the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſouls of men, 22. We wrong others when we communicate not to them when they are in need, and we in a capacity to help them, yea, when by idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and prodigality we incapacitate our ſelves to communicate to the neceſſities, of others as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 28 is clear. 23. Beſide, there cometh in here all ſelling and buying of what ſhould not be ſold or bought, as publick places in Church or State; this firſt from <hi>Simon Magus, Acts</hi> 8. 18. 19. is called <hi>Simony,</hi> and is a ſin of a high degree, making that ſaleable which the Lord will have free: and it taketh in not only giving money, but any other thing upon this account to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſuch and ſuch perſons, or receiving any thing to be ſweyed ſo, and ſo whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>munus manus, linguae aut actionis,</hi> a gift of the hand, tongue, or action. 1. By a gift of the hand is underſtood money or things that are uſually given. 2. A gift of the tongue comprehendeth <hi>fair ſpeeches, ſolicitations flatteries,</hi> &amp;c. 3. By a gift of action is underſtood, <hi>ſervice, dependence, on waiting and courteſies</hi> (as they are called) made uſe of to procure anothers favour; and in all theſe three men may greatly ſin, as when they hunt after, and are ſweyed with any of them, and ſo covet them; as when Magiſtrates or Judges ſell Juſtice for bribes, when men by lying and falſe-witneſs bearing, ſell the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof Lawyers are chiefly guilty, who for fees plead ill cauſes wittingly: or when one giveth them, that he may gain more really upon the other; as for inſtance, when men by any of theſe bribes buy Juſtice, and much more Injuſtice, and buy lies and falſe teſtimonies to prevent or pervert Juſtice. 24. There is a guilt in conſenting too, incouraging in, conniving at, or juſtifying of ſuch as commit this ſin, or are receivers or reſetters of what is ſtollen, for their ſtrengthening and incouragement; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 18. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 10. 25. Seaſing upon other folks goods ſometimes under pretext of eſcheats, as Admirals doe upon <hi>Sea wrack,</hi> and ſuch like; when there is no juſt ground to take away the owners right, and this is reckoned open violence before God, &amp; is a moſt cruel adding of affliction to the afflicted. This ſin then of Theft, in reference to our neighbours, is fallen into by <hi>violence, deceit, negligence, unfaithfulneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ignorance unskilfulneſs,</hi> &amp;c. And when all is ſaid, a tender heart will ſtill need its own exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:31633:140"/>
and tryal of it ſelf, there being as many wayes to break this Command, as there are wayes to prejudice our neighbours eſtate.</p>
               <p>We come now to conſider how a man is guilty in wronging his own eſtate (for there is a skill and dexterity in the managing the <hi>unrighteous Mammon)</hi> which we conſider two wayes; 1. As he wrongeth and diminiſheth his eſtate by not providently caring for its preſervation and increaſe, or improvement' when he is not frugal, or not ſo frugal as he ought to be, but lazie and ſloathful, he becometh guilty of the breach of this Command, becauſe he incapacitateth himſelf for being uſeful to others, and putteth himſelf in hazard of poverty and want, which is the proper ſnare of this ſin of ſtealing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diſpoſeth for it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 9. This poverty which is ſo enſnairing, is brought on 1. By ſinful ſpending and debauching away of our eſtate and time, as the Prodigal did, <hi>Luke.</hi> 15. 11. &amp;c. 2 By unneceſſary waſte in prodigality and lavishneſs, ſuch as (though unjuſtly) <hi>Judas</hi> condemned in the woman, ſpoken of <hi>John</hi> 12. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>For much ſpending muſt have much to uphold it,</hi> and muſt have many wayes to furniſh it ſelf according to the Proverb moſt ordinarily verified, <hi>Omnis Prodigus eſt avarus,</hi> every Prodigal man is greedy or covetous, to ſatisfie one luſt he exerceth another; however, he being but a ſteward of what he poſſeſſeth, he by his prodigality, not only interverteth from the right end what means God hath given him to be otherwayes diſpoſed of, but alſo draweth upon himſelf poverty. 3. By <hi>negligence, lazineſs, careleſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. in a lawful calling (for they that are <hi>given to ſleep, or idleneſs, ſhall come to poverty,</hi> as the Wiſe man ſaith) or being without a calling altogether. When God giveth men ability of body or mind, it is ſad that they ſhould be uſeful for nothing, nor active in any thing but to ſin, and be ſnairs and reproaches unto Chriſtians and Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as all idle perſons, bearing the name of Chriſtians, are, whoever they be, whether Gentlemen or others It is obſervable, that both before the fall, and after the fall, God put that task of working in mans hand, commanding him to labour: many other ſuch fooliſh wayes there are whereby a man cometh unto poverty, and becometh guilty of not providing for himſelf, or his family: Alſo by ſuretyſhip many are bowed and brought low, which although it is not ſimply to be condemned, more then to give freely, yet it is to be well regulated by charity and prudence, directing ſo to aſſiſt our neighbour in his preſent exigence, as we may alſo be ſure of our after relief, leſt for the debts of others, our own families be made to moan for want. 2. We may conſider a mans failing in reference to this Command, as he wrongeth and ſtealeth from himſelf the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By coveting too great a meaſure of riches, ſo that he will not be content with enough, but he will and muſt be rich, this is <hi>avaritia,</hi> or <hi>greed,</hi> even though the means be lawful which he uſeth for acquiring of riches. 2. By the vexing anxious manner of ſeeking after even what is neceſſary: Thus a man may be diffidently and vexingly ſolicitous for his to <hi>morrows dinner,</hi> and be vexed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, as it is <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 31. <hi>Caring for the morrow, what he ſhall eat or drink, or taking thought</hi> about it, this is <hi>carking carefulneſs.</hi> 3.

               <p>For general rules to direct in this matter, I propoſe theſe: 1. Lay by ſuch a <hi>quota</hi> of your eſtate or gain, and let that be dedicated to the uſe of Charity, that ye may have it to bring forth when particular occaſions ſhall offer; men would not alwayes ſtay till it be ſought, but would have, as it were, a <hi>poors box,</hi> or a box for the poor by them, ſo the Lords appointing a certain Tythe under the Law for <hi>widows, fatherleſs, &amp;c.

and after-emergents; yet ſo, as when neceſſity is extream, he go beyond that which is his ordinary allowance; this alſo would prevent all temptations having any tendency to the diſſwading of us from any thing for that uſe, if ſome what were ſet apart for it, and it would alſo eaſe the mind and conſcience of ſuch who were tender, if in ſome particulars they failed, to be clear that they did not hold it in for their own advantage, but that they were forth-coming according to their ability.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This would be done monthly or weekly, as the Apoſtle hath it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1. becauſe it is reaſonable that every week or moneth should have ſomewhat allotted for that uſe, and it will be ſpared with leſs grudge then when it cometh to ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, being put together.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Folks would not delay giving till the needy perſon ſeek; they are often the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter objects of charity who ſeek not; poverty is no reproach, but Vagabond beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and floathful idleneſs, when men are able to work, hath ever been ſo, and should not be tollerated amongſt Chriſtians; but theſe who are right objects of Charity should be provided for, and as it is in <hi>Nebem.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If a man will put it to a conſcientious deliberation, he doth well, and it will not want fruits: I think many could not judge their way to be conſcientiouſly charitable and communicative, if they would thus ſimply and unbyaſſedly put it to the tryal. 3. Folks would judge it by <hi>an equality,</hi> as it is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13. 14. for one man cannot fully ſupply all. Now it is ſomewhat proportionable, if a man, conſidering the ſtate of poor ones and other occaſions, can diſcern ſo much to be uſeful and needful to them, and that his part of that would come to this much, and accordingly to give (even as all gave their proportion of tythes under the Law) whatever others did, only this ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth that men would even go beyond their power ſometimes, when others fail. 4. Folks would ſet aſide the half of their needleſs ſuperfluity, that they may be able to give out of their abundance, that is, when mens families are competently provided of meat, cloathing, and eſtate, if there be ſtill more, let there be as much laid aſide to this uſe; For 1. this cannot burthen them; 2. Leſs cannot be admitted of before God, then to beſtow as much on the neceſſities of others, as on our own ſuperfluities; and 3. this would amount to much, if ſo much were beſtowed on Charity as we beſtow on the ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of meat, wine, building of houſes, houshold plenishing, vain apparel, laces, and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:31633:144"/>
other dreſſings of that ſort. 5. The Lord in the Law ſtinted the people to a <hi>tenth,</hi> or thereby; for <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 21. there was one <hi>tenth</hi> to the Levites alone, who were to give the <hi>tenth</hi> of that to the Prieſts, this might be eaten any where. Again, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 22. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. there was a ſecond <hi>tenth</hi> to be eaten for two years before the Lord, by the man and his houshold, as well as by the Levite, fatherleſs and widow, &amp;c. but every third year was for them only. Now (not to be peremptory) by this proportion it would ſeem that the Lord calleth for a conſiderable part, near or about, the tenth of our free rent or gain, which he would have us to employ thus, and this would be found no great burthen, and it might be waited with Gods bleſſing upon what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth.</p>
               <p>It is then, you ſee, no little part of wiſdome to walk rightly in the things of the World, yet as <hi>holineſs</hi> is no friend to <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> ſo neither is it to <hi>prodigality,</hi> there is a midſt betwixt theſe two, which is called <hi>frugality,</hi> this is well conſiſtent with <hi>piety,</hi> for it neither carkingly gathereth, nor careleſly neglecteth, nor prodigally waſteth or caſteth away, but is a ſparing and ſpending, a gaining and giving out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to right reaſon. But for the further explication of it, I shall put you in mind of theſe following Scriptures, which have ſo many properties, qualifications, evidences, or commendations of frugality. 1. It provideth <hi>for things honeſt before God and men,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 17. 2. It maketh a man look well to his <hi>herds and flocks,</hi> and in a gainful ſinleſs calling is diligent, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 23. and not <hi>ſloathful in buſineſs. Rom.</hi> 12. 11.—3. It is not vain and lordly, ſo a frugal woman is deſcribed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 10. &amp;c. by being honeſt in her carriage, honeſt in her family, providing for her husband, children, and ſervants, cloaths, fare, &amp;c. yet not vain, she maketh her own cloath, and her family is provided for, in an honeſt thrifty way, without great coſt. 4. It is provident, though not covetous, like the <hi>Ant laying up in Summer, Prov.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>And the vertuous woman ſeeth and conſidereth a field, and purchaſeth it, Prov.</hi> 31. 16. 5. It is taken up about things neceſſary, not ſuperfluous, <hi>John</hi> 13. 29. the Diſciples thought <hi>Judas</hi> had been ſent out to <hi>buy what was neceſſary,</hi> not what was ſuperfluous. 6. It putteth nothing to unthrifty uſes, nor ſuffereth any thing needleſly to perish, according to that Word of our Lords, Joh. 6. 12. <hi>Take up the fragments that remain, that nothing, be loſt.</hi> 7. It moderateth its gifts, that they be neither of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs nor prodigality, but as it is <hi>Pſalm</hi> 112. <hi>The good man guideth his affairs with diſcretion.</hi> 8. The frugal man his conqueſt is in that which hurteth not others, and rather by his own induſtry then others ſimplicity; It lyeth rather in his diligence and dexterity, then in his ſlight and cunning, in duty to ſatisfie conſcience, and not in ſin to raiſe a challenge. It is in a word, a following of riches with Gods bleſſing, ſeeking them both together, it being, <hi>the bleſsing of the Lord which onely maketh rich,</hi> Prov. 10. 21. <hi>and he addeth no ſorrow therewith;</hi> all other riches without this, have ſorrows multiplyed on them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. the good man, and truely frugal, <hi>ſeeketh firſt the Kingdom of Heaven, Matth.</hi> 6. 33. and <hi>the one thing neceſſary,</hi> and alloweth not himſelf to be cumbered about <hi>many things,</hi> as <hi>Martha</hi> was, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 41. he chooſeth the right time and ſeaſon, and is not inordinately bent upon gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, he knoweth <hi>there is a time to ſcatter,</hi> as well as <hi>to gather,</hi> as it is <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 6.

Gen.,</hi> 31. 41. and many ſuch characters are there, whereby the covetous may be tryed and diſcovered, as eſpecially when they come to juſtifie and defend, and continue in theſe forementioned unſeemly wayes of getting gain, and much more when unlawful ſhifts are uſed to gain by? It is like that in ſuch caſes covetous perſons have been eccleſiaſtically reprehended, or at leaſt, there hath been a <hi>brotherly withdrawing from them</hi> to put a <hi>note</hi> on them, as was put on <hi>drunkards, extortioners</hi> &amp;c. as alſo 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 14. the Apoſtle command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe perſons, who were guilty of the oppoſit ſin of <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> to be marked with a <hi>note</hi> of ſhame.</p>
               <p>And although it be hard to make out covetouſneſs in particulars, where there is no ſin in the matter; yet generally where there is a perſon that exceſſively is ſo, there will be both a common account of him to be ſuch in his dealing, by thoſe who can diſcern, and many complaints of all, almoſt againſt him, and a hard diſeſteem of him: From the grounds that have been touched on, it is ſomewhat evident that ſuch who generally are called, <hi>

Moreover, as the Command is not to exact <hi>uſury from the poor brother,</hi> ſo it commandeth alſo, <hi>not to exect just debts, Deut.</hi> 15. 1. 2. 3. from him when he is poor, yet none I ſuppoſe, will argue from that, that no man might ask his own, even the principal ſum from others, who are able to pay it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord allowed gain of lent money to be taken, from <hi>ſtrangers, Deut.</hi> 23. 20 and yet it cannot be ſaid that he did allow them any thing towards ſtrangers, which is in it ſelf contrary to the Moral Law or light of Nature, or which is ſinful in it ſelf. It is true, as to <hi>poor strangers,</hi> God made one Law for his people and for them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 35. 36. and further he injoyned that the ſtranger ſhould not he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed amongſt them almoſt every where, and therefore this other allowing the taking of <hi>uſury</hi> from ſtrangers, if rich is the more binding.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeak to this point a little more diſtinctly, I ſuppoſe that ſomething com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in it may be found peculiar to the Eſtate and Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and therefore referrable to that part of the Divine Law which is commonly called Judicial, and in its direct authority only intended by the Lord for that people, and ſomething common to all men, as flowing from the principles of equity and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, held forth in the eighth Command; that which I conceive to be common, is the rule given for lending to the poor, which therefore we ſee is made binding by the Law of God, both toward an Iſraelite and a Stranger, and doth certainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that we ſhould lend to ſuch freely, without regard to our own profit, and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:31633:146"/>
only for their ſupply and relief in charity, permitting a free uſe of our money; and as for the ſecurity of our repayment, minding it with that fair temper of equity and moderation, which we our ſelves would expect if neceſſitated to borrow: Beſides, the rule ſhould alſo influence our continuing and manner of exacting the debt, that all he done without rigour, and with that goodneſs, that even the loſs of the principal, if ſo it ſhould fall out, ſhould be no grudge or diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the thing which I take to be peculiar to that people, is, that I think the trade of leading, or lending for profit, was abſolutely to them prohibited among themſelves, which is clear from <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 19. and the diſtinction there made betwixt an Iſraelite, from whom uſury might not be taken, and a Stranger from whom profit is permitted. And the reaſons of this Command might not only be the better prevention of rigorus loaning and exacting, the ſtirring up of all to honeſt and diligent labour (from which the hope of borrowing, as well as the profit of lending doth often keep back) and other ſuch conſiderations too much neglected in all States and Polities, but alſo it might flow from other things particular in their condition, ſuch as the equal diſtribution of their Land, ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to perpetuity by the recourſe of their Jubilees, and it may be that the riches and conveniency of its ſituation for forreign traffique, with ſomething peculiar in the rigid and covetous temper of that people, might alſo have occaſioned this precept; certain it is, that this prohibition of the trade of loaning, and that Statute of the Seventh year of Releaſe, have a manifeſt conſonancy. But as to us, and all other people, to whom the Lord hath not ſo commanded, and who are clearly under another polity, and in many other different circumſtances, I do not ſee why this loaning for profit in a righteous and equitable manner, ſhould be accounted prohibit, and becauſe that loaning of money for profit, and taking of profit for money in other forms of bargaining, are of their own nature very like, and by uſe much confounded: We ſhall ſpeak to both, what may be pertinent and edifying, without obſerving any more curious then uſeful diſtinctions; and it is known that the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> from <hi>equity</hi> grant, that in ſome caſes a man may make gain by lending his money; As 1. when it is <hi>lucrum ceſſans</hi>

               <p n="4">4. It is not for naught that our Lord uſeth the parable of the <hi>talents,</hi> wherein certainly he intendeth no unlawful way of trading, but that which was commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in its proper circumſtances.</p>

5. In matter of communicating and charity, the Apoſtle requireth an <hi>equality,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13, 14. and that one ſhould not be burthened and another free: Now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one of a leſſer eſtate to have only money, ſhall he be obliged to the pinching and burthening of himſelf to lend more, and that freely (upon the account of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for there is no other meant here) then a man of a greater eſtate is, becauſe he hath it not in money, where is the equality?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Right reaſon agreeable to Scripture will clear this; ſuppoſe one gives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo much land for ſo much money, and the buyer deſires to retain a part of the money, ſhall the ſeller be incapacitated to receive now any thing leſs of his eſtate when in money, then formerly when it was in land? Is it not ſtill his eſtate and of the ſame value? and therefore may it not yield that ſame equivalent by moderate uſury or intereſt?</p>
               <p n="7">7. If it were abſolutely denyed, then theſe abſurdities would follow, 1. That ſome eſtates would be uſeleſs to their maſters or owners, and others not: 2. That ſome, for inſtance, <hi>Ministers, Orphans,</hi> and perſons unable for trade, ſhould be inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated to make any uſe of their eſtates, or any proviſion for their families meerly on this account, becauſe either they are in ſuch ſtations, or have their eſtates in ſuch a condition: 3. Then ſhould one get no payment of money, no not the principal, ſuppoſe the perſon owing could not repay the principal without ſelling ſome part of his eſtate (ſeeing we ought not to ſeek in the <hi>principal d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then we ought not to turn our eſtate from money to land, becauſe in doing ſo we diſinable our ſelves to lend freely. Then alſo there needed not, nay, there ought not to be any ſelling of land or buying amongſt neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours (as in ſome reſpect it was not amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> but to the year of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee) becauſe 1. If men get money freely, they might ſtill, and no doubt would ſtill keep their eſtates, and not pay their debts: 2. If men could not take any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe for money it ſelf, then could not a man buy another mans poſſeſſion, which can yield him afterwards that ſame principal ſum, and alſo yearly ſo much more, for this doth infer an increaſe alſo: And beſide, if this did hold true, then what rule were to be kept in lending? If it be ſaid <hi>charity,</hi> that is granted, but ſo long as a mans eſtate is better then mine, can any ſay I am in charity obliged to give him, or lend him, and get nothing again? If any ſay <hi>equity</hi> ſhould be the rule; none will ſay it is equity the borrower ſhould poſſeſs his own eſtate, and mine alſo, and give nothing to me, when by my loan benefit accreſſeth to him: And if one may give money for land, and then exact rent, why may not one give that ſame money to another, and ſuffer him to poſſeſs the land bought with it, and expect ſo much rent from him? when he accounteth the having of the money at ſuch a rate of encreaſe and benefit, the land, poſsibly in his account, being beyond the rent or the worth of that money: And if there could not be any intereſt taken, men ſhould never, nor could never expect borrowing or lending for furthering their profit, but for meer neceſsity, and by that means the great benefit of humane trading would be interrupted.</p>
               <p>Add that men are called to equity and charity, not ſo much according to the quality of their eſtates, as to the quantity or value, that there may be an equality. And if a man that hath money be obliged to lend freely, is not a man that hath land
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:31633:147"/>
obliged to ſell it, that he alſo may be in a capacity to do it? Certainly when neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo requireth, he is obliged to give, although he ſhould ſell his land for that end. And conſidering that money is ſo uſeful (for it <hi>anſwereth all things,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 19.) and that in reaſon it cannot be ſuppoſed that a thrifty and frugal man will have a ſum any conſiderable time, but either by trading or buying land, or otherwayes, he ſhall benefit himſelf by it, there is no ſuch reaſon to cry out on the iniquity of this ſimply conſidered; yea, conſidering that ſome have money, others have acceſs to improve it, which they have not by dexterity, health, occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, &amp;c. yet wanting money, the exerciſe of all theſe is impeded, it would ſeem that if the money of the one make the skill of another profitable to him, that then the dexterity of that man ſhould make the others money profitable to both, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the due proportion; ſo that as the one could not uſe the others labour without him, ſo neither the other his money, that ſo there might be equality.</p>
               <p>It is queſtioned mainly, if one may covenant or contract for ſo much liquidat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his lent money; (ſeeing ſome will ſay, if one will bide the hazard of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers trade there is no queſtion) and how much this may be?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That there may be ſuch a contracting and covenanting cannot be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, more then it can be in ſelling land or houſes (though the money lent may poſſibly be truſted to the borrower, without any antecedent, contract, or covenant, and the increaſe thereafter proportioned to the gain of the borrower) it is true that this would be moderated, and within the gain that otherwiſe with hazard might be expected, becauſe the lender is free of hazard, and we conceive the <hi>How much</hi> may by theſe rules be tryed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man may covenant for as much as by a free bargain his money would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe yield him; as ſuppoſe one by beſtowing that ſum on land, would with as much certainty as can be in ſuch matters, obtain ſo much land-rent, why may he not let his money for that, ſeeing it can be no filthy or diſhoneſt gain; that being properly <hi>Uſury,</hi> that by lending gaineth inordinately, or more then lawfully, otherwiſe it might or would, and that to anothers prejudice.</p>

Yea, 2. the rules of charity and equity are not to be broken as they are, when either the poor are not let unto for the ſupply of their neceſſity, or only on the ſame tearms with the rich; this is againſt the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. and what the Lord ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 34 35. commanding to lend without expectation of any thing, when the borrowers caſe calleth for it. 3. No increaſe would be exacted from theſe that neither gain by increaſing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their own portion, but when what is gained is imployed for their neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuſtentation; or when without their deſire, and not by negligence, they are put to ſtraits, or cannot command their own, or their own is but little, and will not bear their giving of increaſe, and ſuſtain themſelves too, in this caſe it is <hi>their life and bread,</hi> nothing is to be exacted, as it is <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 4. Folks would not ſo empty their hands by lending to rich Folks all, (if they may ſpare any) as to be incapacita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to lend freely to the poor, for ſo men may fruſtrate the great end of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and fail againſt the rules of Charity. 5.

               <p>Thou shalt not grieve that he is well, nor aim at his hurt, nor be diſcontent that thy own lot ſeemeth not ſo good. And as for the reaſon why this Command is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, its ſcope holdeth it forth, which ſeemeth to be this, I not onely require you (as if the Lord had ſaid) not to ſteal from him, and not to let your mind run looſe in cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is his, as in the eighth Command, not only to abſtain from Adultery or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Luſt in the heart, as in the ſeventh Command, and not onely the abſtaining from wronging of his life, as in the ſixth Command, and of his name that way ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the ninth Command, or wronging of them that are in place and power by ſuch heart luſts in us as are forbidden in the fifth Command; but I require ſuch holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that there be not any inordinate luſt or motion entertained, not having a being in the heart, although it never get <hi>conſent,</hi> but on the contrary, that in reference to all theſe Commands in your carriage towards your Neighbour, there be in you a full contentation with the lot that God hath carved out to you, without the leaſt inordinate motion or inclination to the contrary, which may either be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with love to him, or with contentment and a right compoſure of ſpirit in your ſelves.</p>
               <p>From this we may ſee that this Command is unreaſonably and unjuſtly divided by <hi>Papiſts</hi> into two Commands, the one relating to the Neighbours <hi>houſe,</hi> the other to his <hi>wife,</hi> and what followeth: For, 1. this concupiſcence or luſt looketh not onely to the ſeventh and eighth, but to the fifth and ſixth, and ninth Commands, there being an inordinate affection towards thy Neighbours life and honour, or eſtimation alſo; and it is inſtanced in theſe two, becauſe they are more diſcernible and common: This then sheweth that God taketh in this inordinateneſs of the heart, under one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, in reference to whatſomever object it be, otherwayes we behoved to ſay that either the Commands are defective, or that there is no ſuch inordinateneſs to other objects of other Commands (which is abſurd) or by the ſame reaſon we muſt multiply commands for them alſo, which yet the adverſaries themſelves do not. 2.

contrarily, and ſo the order of theſe <hi>ten words</hi> (as they are called by the Lord) would be confounded. But the great thing we are mainly to inquire into, is the meaning of this Command; in which Papiſts being loath to acknowledge corrupt natures caſe to be ſo deſperate as it is, and deſigning to maintain perfection of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteouſneſs and juſtification by works, do make this ſin of Luſt, forbidden in this Command, a very general thing, and all of us ordinarily are apt to think light of this ſin.</p>

As it is partly natural to man to have ſuch ſtirrings in him, as flow from the natural faculty and power of deſiring, ſo Chriſt, as man, deſired meat and drink: and this being natural, was certainly in <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, and as the will and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are not evil in themſelves, ſo is not this: It is neither of theſe that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſpeaketh of. 2.

It is this which God forbiddeth in this Command, and ſetteth bounds to the deſiring or concupiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faculty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſay there is a two-fold conſideration of this ſinful Concupiſcence. 1. As it is in the ſenſual part onely, and the inferiour faculties of the ſoul, as to <hi>meet, drink, uncleanneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Or, 2. we may conſider it as it reacheth further and riſeth higher, having its ſeat in the heart and will, and running through the whole affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, yea, even the whole man, who in this reſpect is called <hi>Fleſh</hi> in the Scripture, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 17. and there is Hereſie and other evils attributed unto it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. 20, 21. which will not agree to the former, ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23, 24. it is called the <hi>Law of the Members, and the body of death,</hi> and hath a <hi>wiſdom, Rom.</hi> 8. 7. that is <hi>enmity against God,</hi> corrupting all, and inclining and by-aſſing wrong in every thing, ſo that a man becauſe of it, hath not the right uſe of any faculty within him: This Concupiſcence, which is ſeated not only in the ſenſible, but in the rational part of the ſoul, is that which is intended here, which is the fountain and head-ſpring of all other evils; for, <hi>from the heart proceed evil thoughts,</hi> &amp;c.

The occaſions of it, and ſnares to it, are rife and frequent, nothing we ſee, but readily it doth, as fire, inflame this Luſt, ſo that we have need continually, as it were, to caſt water on it; yea, what thing is there that is in it ſelf lovely and deſirable we hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or read of, that we are not ready inordinately to be ſtirred towards the deſiring of it. 14. Its pretexts and cloaks to hide it ſelf are many, and ſometimes ſpecious, ſo that men are ſeldom challenged for it, if it come not to the length of being conſented to, or at leaſt of a delectation: How often are there wiſhes in our mouths, and oftner in our hearts, that break this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we obſerve not? eſpecially, if they be for knowledge or ſome good thing in another, or ſome good thing done by another which commendeth him; for then, <hi>O if we had it!</hi> or, <hi>O if we had done it!</hi> is often the language of the heart, and ſo there is a ſecret diſcontent againſt our Neighbour, which often run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to envy, or at leaſt to a diſcontent that it is not ſo with us, and that we are behind in that; but eſpecially in ſpiritual things we take liberty for theſe diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wiſhes, alſo grudgings, that another is free and we are croſſed, come in under the ſin here forbidden; as alſo that which is ſpoken of <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>of much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and making many books,</hi> when one is deſirous inordinately, either to have, or to make many books to vent his knowledge by, eſpecially when it levelleth at what others have done.</p>
               <p>This inordinacy that is in the motions of the heart, appeareth much, 1. In the beginnings and ſtirrings of paſſions and diſcontent which often never come abroad, but yet are deep breaches of this Command, either as marring that loving and kindly frame which we ought to carry towards others, or as inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with that inward ſerenity and tranquility that we ſhould conſerve in our ſelves, that dumpiſhneſs (which is ordinarily to be ſeen in paſſionate and diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perſons) often proceeding from, or tending to one of theſe two, <hi>paſſion</hi> or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It appeareth in bargains, as when we hear of a good bargain or good mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage which another hath gotten, or ſome good event or iſſue he hath had in ſuch or ſuch an undertaking, there is a ſecret grudge that we have not got it, or that we have not had ſuch ſucceſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That thoughtineſs and anxious carefulneſs which often is in bargains making, how they may be ſure and moſt for our advantage, is we conceive eſpecially point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at here, there is a ſuitable carefulneſs, which ſimply, and in it ſelf is conſiſtent
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:31633:155"/>
with lawful diligence, but this anxiety ſinfully accompanieth it through our inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy in it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It ſheweth it ſelf in thoſe many ruings and repentings which often are after things are done, and wiſhings they had not been done, which are not ſimply ſinful when there is reaſon for them, but as they are carking and inordinate, as for moſt part they are in us. We ought to grieve with after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>grief and ſorrowful ſharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection for the ſin of what we do in all theſe above ſaid, and others ſuch like; but its repining againſt God, and his infinitely wiſe government, to grudge at diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, events, and conſequents, which are meer providences.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This inordinacy of heart motions doth much appear in the vexing after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts of, and reflections upon any thing we have done, not ſo much becauſe of its ſinfulneſs, as becauſe of its bringing ſhame upon us, or becauſe of its unſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to what our humour aimed at; and upon this account we are diſcontented, and have an inordinate and unſatisfied deſire of having it other wayes done, and ſo diſcontent is the proof and evidence of this Luſt, diſcovering it where it is, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our deſire (though poſſibly it be confuſed and for <hi>any good,</hi> as it is <hi>Pſalm</hi> 4. 6.) is not fulfilled, therefore is heavineſs and diſcontent, whereas if it were ſatisfied, there would be quietneſs.</p>
               <p>So then we conceive this Command, as to its poſitive part, doth 1. Require love to our Neighbour, and complacency in his proſperous condition, and all ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are inconſiſtent with it, are here forbidden, though they never come to act, and being ſuch as we would not have any others entertaining towards us. 2. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntinent</hi> ſo that diſcontent, diſcouragement, fainting heavineſs, anxiety, diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and not reſting ſatisfied with our own lot, which is forbidden. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 5. are condemned here. 3. A holy frame of heart, a delight in the Law of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to it, <hi>Ram.</hi> 7. 22. Hence theſe motions are counted oppoſite to it which were in <hi>Paul</hi> (although he wreſtled againſt them, as was ſaid) and are the Imaginations of mens hearts, but the ſerenity and tranquil compoſure of the heart having every thing ſubject and ſubordinate to the Law of God, is called for here. 4. It requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth compleat conformity to the Law of God, and exact and perfect love to, and delight in him. Thus this Command is broken, when there is any ſtirring of heart inconſiſtent with perfect love to him and his Law: But obedience is given to it when we <hi>put off the old man, and put on the new man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>created after God, &amp;c. Col.</hi> 3. 9. 10. and attain unto a ſtayed, compoſed, eſtabliſhed, and fixed heart, ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in Scripture. For the difference of this Command from the for mer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, is not in the object, but in the act <hi>luſt,</hi> for determinate luſt, for inſtance, looketh to the ſeventh Command, but here a ſort of vaging unſetledneſs in the thought that cannot be called adultery, as not partaking of that name, yet really is Luſt, is forbidden, and ſo alſo vain wanderings upon <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>notions</hi> come in here under the name of Luſt, and are ſinful, being inconſiſtent with a compoſed frame of heart.</p>
               <p>To cloſe up all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let us conſider a little theſe words, Rom. 7. 7. <hi>I had not known luſt except the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w had ſaid, then ſhalt not covet:</hi> I ſhal onely premit this one-word, that it is ſomthing peculiar to this Command, that men in nature come not the length of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it up. <hi>Paul</hi> before converſion knew that the conſented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>to deſire of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful thing was ſin, but be knew not this narrow bounding of men to be intended in this Command.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:31633:155"/>
In the words then you may take up theſe three, 1. That there is a great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and inordinacy in Folks hearts, even in the leaſt things, which oft-times they take no notice of. 2. That generally men in nature do not advert to this, and are never throughly humbled under it. 3. That there is ſuch an indwelling luſt as this, which is ſpoken of here even in the heart of the Believer, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to this Command will be as ſeriouſly aimed at by him, and he will be as much troubled and affected with the breach of it, as of any of the other Commands.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, I ſhall firſt interrogate you a few things, 1. How often is your mind ſtirring and reeling like the raging Sea? 2. How often, or rather how ſeldom, can ye ſay that theſe motions and ſtirrings are conform to the Law of God, or conſiſting with true love to God, and delight in him and in his Law? Are there not in your hearts wonderful ſwarms of vain Imaginations that ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give a reaſon for, and cannot tell how they come in, nor how they go out? which yet are all breaches of this Command. 3. How often do ye take notice of them, or are ſuitably affected with them? 2. For further conviction of the ſinfulneſs of this, conſider the extent of the Command. 1. A man by the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Command may be guilty of the breach of all the reſt: 2. Its exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, in reſpect of the occaſions a man hath to break it, his eye will look to nothing but this luſt will take occaſion from it to ſin, the hearing of ſuch and ſuch a thing, will by means of this waken a deſire to be at it, though the impoſſibility of acting it may impede his determination: 3. It is extenſive in reſpect of the continual bad poſture the heart is in, ſo that hardly can a perſon take a look of it, but he will find this ſin of inordinacy in the thoughts in it, and ſome plagues as effects following on it. 3. For yet further conviction, conſider the greatneſs of the ſin, 1. In that it not onely runneth after particular objects, the coveting whereof is againſt the other Commands, but fore-ſeeth and inventeth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the brain, and ſo this Luſt is broader then a man hath exiſtent objects to it, as when he deſireth to be rich, but knoweth not how: 2. We may gather the greatneſs of this ſin, partly from the nature of it, called in Scripture, <hi>enmity againſt God, Rom.</hi> 8. 7. party from the brude and product of it, called <hi>the fruit of the fleſh,</hi> partly from the fruit that it bringeth forth, and that is <hi>death,</hi> it begetteth other ſins, not onely by indiſpoſing to duty, but by actual inclining and diſpoſing to evil, ſo that when the Devil cometh to tempt, he hath no more to do but to blow up this fire of Luſt that is within, and needeth not bring new fire to kindle it. Our ſcope in all this is to bring you to know that ſuch a thing as this inordinate Luſt is in you, and that it is exceeding ſinful; ye cannot deny but the Devil and Luſt ſtirreth as much in you as it did in regenerate and eminently holy <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet how is it that ye are as quiet as if it were not in you at all? ſuch ſerious and ſenſible ſouls as have rightly ſeen this, will loath themſelves, as being, becauſe of it, moſt pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and unclean, and will cry out, <hi>Oh! we are vile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the ſecond thing in the words, folks may be a long time ere they take up this ſin, &amp; generally men in nature do not know it: there are many vile ſins in the heart that never were deliberate, nor yet fully conſented to, when this ſin is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to <hi>Paul,</hi> he getteth another ſight of the nature of ſin then he would have believed formerly he could have had; Folks are rarely affected with <hi>Original ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n,</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:31633:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that thwarteth with, and is contrary to the Law of God, and ſeldom burthened with this <hi>habitual Luſt,</hi> that ſtirreth even in Believers, becauſe but renewed in part, and ſo it is but deſtroyed in part; and it is a great and groſs miſtake to think that grace altogether expelleth it here, and it is ſometimes their guilt that they-fret and are diſcontented and diſcouraged, not ſo much becauſe of the ſinfulneſs of the ſin, as that it ſhould be in their lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; for it is one thing to be ſeriouſly wreſtling againſt this Luſt, and bemoaning it, and another thing to have a perplexedneſs about it; as when there is a fretting that ſuch a thing is not better done, and yet no ſerious ſorrow, becauſe of the wrong doing of it ſimply, and in it ſelf conſidered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there is an inordinateneſs wherein the fleſh prevaileth, even in complaints of ſin, and in deſiring good: And ſo this Command regulateth our deſire, not onely in reference to the object, but as to the way and manner of purſuing it.</p>
               <p>As to the third thing in the words, that this Luſt or Concupiſcence is in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever (as we have juſt now ſaid) it is uncontrovertibly clear from what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle aſſerteth of himſelf, and moſt bitterly bemoaneth in that Chapter, and from the univerſal experience of the Saints, ſo that we need ſay nothing more particularly of it then we have ſaid; onely it may be asked if there be ſuch a Concupiſcence in the Believer, how doth it differ from that which is in Natural men? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Sin not onely <hi>dwelleth,</hi> but <hi>commandeth</hi> and <hi>reigneth</hi> in the Natural man; but though Corruption dwell in the Believer, and may ſometimes take him captive, yet he doth not with the benſel of his ſould yield to it. 2. A Natural man is wholly one, or if there be any warring or diſſention, it is but one luſt ſtriving with another, the Believer is <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oſome</hi> (as they uſe to ſay) he hath two parties or ſides, and when cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption prevaileth, grace will be ſaying, <hi>O that it were otherwayes.</hi> 3. The Believes diſcerneth his luſts far better nor he did while unregenerate, and ſeeth themas ſo many evil ſpirits dancing and reeling within him. 4. This indwelling corruption is one of his greateſt weights, yea, it is exceeding weighty, and his moſt grievous burthen, heavier not onely then all outward afflictions, but even, in ſome reſpect, then actual tranſgreſſions, for he findeth that he is never ſooner off his watch, but his evil inclination ſetteth on him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is his exerciſe, this marreth his peace, and maketh him loath himſelf, when the World ſeeth nothing in his converſation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable: This did much more pinch and afflict <hi>Paul</hi> then his perſecution, and maketh him cry out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>What ſhall I do, O wretched, O miſerable man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> All the outward afflictions and tribulations that he met with, drew never ſuch a word from him; he could through grace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, yea, glory in the midſt of them, but this maketh him cry out of himſelf as miſerable, it being indeed the thing, that in it ſelf, and in the eſteem of the Child of God, when at himſelf, maketh him beyond all things in the World look at himſelf as wretched and miſerable, and if Faith in Chriſt were not kept up, the Believer in this caſe would deſpair and give it over; but it is neither the Natural mans exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, nor yet his burthen. 5. The Natural man hath not a ſpiritual ſenſe to favour and reliſh the things of God, and as little inward feeling of his corruption that is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the grace of God, but outward things are only or moſt ſweet to him: The Believer reliſheth ſpiritual things; but remaining corruption mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:31633:156"/>
them, with more pain he vomits it up again, and it troubleth his ſtomach, as it were, till he get it caſt out; Gods people get not leave to drink with full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the things of the World, as Natural men do; for the Believer having two parties in him. Grace and Corruption, whereof, while out of Heaven, he is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted; what contenteth the one can never content the other: but the Natural man having but onely one party, and being wholly conſtituted of Corruption, he hath more delight, not onely in ſinful things, but alſo in worldly things then the Believer.</p>
               <p>The ſcope of all is to diſcover your ſuperficialneſs and overlineſs in examining your ſelves, to put you to be more ſerious in that neceſſary and uſeful exerciſe, and to teach you by what Command ye ſhould moſt examine your ſelves, even by this tenth Command, as being that which will make the cleareſt &amp; moſt throughly ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovery of your ſelves to your ſelves, and will beſt rid marches betwixt you and hypocrites; to put you in thankfulneſs to acknowledge, and with admiration to adore the exceeding great goodneſs of God, in providing and giving a Mediator on whom he hath laid all theſe innumerable Iniquities of all his people, which would have ſunk them eternally under the unſupportable weight of them; to let you ſee how abſolutely neceſſary, how unſpeakably uſeful, and ſtedable he is to ſo many wayes, and ſo deeply guilty ſinners; and withal to lead you to improve and make uſe of him for doing them away, both as to the guilt and filth of them; which when God ſhall, for Chriſts ſake, be graciouſly pleaſed to do, will not every belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul have reaſon to ſay and ſing to the commendation of his Grace, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity?
