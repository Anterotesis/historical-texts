            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sondry reasons there were that at the first, about three yeares agoe, moued me to begin the translation thereof, but because they are such as concerne matter of estate, where withall I list not

to meddle for feare of burning my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, I thought it good rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale them, then in printe to publish them. The onely occasion, that caused mee after so long time hauing layed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, to take it vp againe and finish the same, was the graue iudgement of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Moile Finche</hi> a right worshipfull knight in <hi>Kent,</hi> who this last Sommer beeing with you at your Maner of <hi>Beakes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne,</hi> vpon speech then had about the great preparations of the <hi>Turke</hi> agaynst Christendome, and the huge victories that he had atchieued vpon his enemies that sought to weaken him, did verie highly commende this booke, and the Author thereof: whose eloquence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my english pen cannot possibly reache and expresse, yet is it trulie and faithfully doone in as plaine and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant

Termes as I could: whereuntoo I was once minded to haue added certain aduertisementes and collections, as well out of the old auncient writers both sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and prophane, that haue written of the most stately &amp; magnificent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> in times past, as also out of <hi>Leunclaius</hi> &amp; others, that haue lately written of the moderne and present estate thereof, which hath scarse a shaddow of the antique go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, wherewith it was then ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led &amp; gouerned. But that matter grew to be so long, that I gaue ouer my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose therein, least the volume should haue waxen too great. I was also min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to haue inserted into this Treatise, a certaine Prophesie touching the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe of the <hi>Turkish</hi> kingdom, which <hi>Antonius Torquatus</hi> of <hi>Ferrara</hi> did deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough <hi>Strabo</hi> doo write, that the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges touching matters of <hi>Persia,</hi> had alwaies but small credit euen vntill his time: and therefore it may seeme likely, that I, who haue taken vpon me to wryte such thinges as haue happened in those cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ries within the space of nyne yeares, ought greatly to feare lest these my writinges should haue the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same successe, that they had: yet I haue thought it necessary to aduertise the reader, that for that respect I did not surcease, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to publish this my history, (though indeed for dyuers other wantes and defectes it may seeme peraduenture not soe worthy to appeere before the learned persons of this present age:) But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen for the selfe same cause, it may rest assured, that without manifest wrong &amp; iniury it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be despised or discredited. For if those former <hi>Historiographers</hi> (if algates they were euer wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that name) haue deserued, that little credit should be yelded vnto them: this default was imputed vnto them not for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite or reproch, but in iustice and in reason: because (as <hi>Strabo</hi> himselfe saith) they louing more to delight then to profit, inserted many fictions &amp; many fables in the truth &amp; purity of the History. And so the things that happened in deed, being mingled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused with such as were cogged and fained, they that read them, could not be so truly enformed of those aduentures and actions, as
<pb facs="tcp:23114:7"/>
they desyred, and peraduenture as they had great neede at that time to be instructed in. But I haue written this history, with a full and sound resolution, neuer to decline from the truth, &amp; not to suffer, that vpon any occasion whatsoeuer, any thing should bee discoursed therein, but that which eyther I my selfe haue seene, or possibly could vnderstand to be true. Wherein, although I haue found many difficulties and vsed great labours, (aswell through the ignorance of the people, who being not able to tell me any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name of the Cittyes, of the cuntries, of the fieldes, of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, &amp; of the hilles, but onely the barbarous names of them, they made the certaine knowledge of those places, wherein these battells were foughten, to be very difficult vnto me: As also because it was very requisite, that I should haue an eie to the seuer all qualities of dyuers nations, who are sometimes giuen to lying, and by whom many thinges are wont to bee spoken, and many thinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, for their owne particular respectes.) Notwithstanding I haue endeuored by all the best meanes I possibly could, to discharge my duty therein, ouercomming these &amp; such other difficulties, with continuall conference among dyuers men in dyuers places, to the end I might find them agree together in their reportes, and expecting withall, that Tyme it selfe would at last bring forth the truth. Neither did I euer content my selfe with the first or second aduertisement deliuered vnto me, but alwaies iustified the first with the last, by conferring together the testimonies of both sides. And lastly, without regard of danger, of expenses, or of labour, I haue enformed my self of euery particularity, that possibly I could, by such men, as were esteemed no liers, but men of great authority, who were present for the most part at al these actions. Which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and resolution of myne, was greatly fauoured and assisted by three priuate &amp; extraordinary meanes. First, by the credit and authoritie of <hi>Theodoro Balbj,</hi> and <hi>Giouanni Michele,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the right honorable Consulles in <hi>Soria</hi> for the Venetian
<pb facs="tcp:23114:7"/>
Senate, two most noble, prudent, and valorouse subiectes of the State of <hi>Venice:</hi> who most magnificently without sparing of any costes did fauour me herein, &amp; in all my other studies, where, vnto I applyed my selfe in those countries. Secondly by the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar conuersation which I had with one <hi>Christoforo de Buonj,</hi> cheefe Interpreter to the said most honorable Lordes, a person of great valour, well frended and beloued among those nations, and aboue all, of singular faith and dexterity. Thirdly, by my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Phisicke, which I was not squemish to practise among those people, to the end I might the better, &amp; without ministring any suspition to any man, enter into their most secret &amp; important aduertisementes: and so by this meanes to purchase familiarity in the principall howses of those Citties, wherein for the space of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most seuen whole yeares together, I liued and was entertayned. And of thus much it shall be euen sufficient to haue aduertised the readers, who without any other Apologie or iustification of mine, mayrest contented and satisfied with my desyre, which hath beene to represent vnto the world Accidentes, that haue happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so far off, so strange, and so important, that thereby they may reape great profit both in peace and warre. Which satisfaction if I shall obtaine of their gratitude, I shall thinke my selfe to haue gayned enough, in lieu of all the trauelles, of all the dangers, &amp; of all the expences, that I haue susteyned, &amp; I shall rest assured that I haue not beene an vnfruitfull labourer herein.</p>

A warre not onely long &amp; blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but also very commodious and of great oportunitie to the Christian Common-wealth: for that it hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">The warre in Persia commodious for the state of Christendom.</note> leisure to the Champions of Christ to refresh and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their forces, being now much weakened by warres both Forreine and Ciuill. A matter in truth rather diuine then humane, there being now newly arisen among the <hi>Turkes,</hi> fresh hopes of victories, by meanes whereof (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the custome of such contentions) the wrath of these two Princes was drawne in length, which if they had bene conuerted against <hi>Europe,</hi> might haue made our state most troublesome and turbulent. These successes and all the rest, that together with the like motions haue come to passe, sometimes intermingling among them the priuy treacheries of the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> sometimes the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the people of <hi>Drusia,</hi> and sometimes also the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> I here take in hand to describe, being therunto moued, principally vpon two occasions. The one is, for that they all seeme to me of themselues ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worthy to be knowne both of the men that liue at this <note place="margin">The causes that moue the author to wryte this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie.</note> day, &amp; also of those that shall come after vs: neither haue I as yet seene any man that hath made any full or true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thereof Which notwithstanding I hope shalbe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in performed by my myselfe who haue bene entertained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23114:10"/>
seauen whole yeares (during the said warres) partly in <hi>Soria,</hi> partly in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and by occasion of my practise in Phisicke, haue bene familiarly conuersant with many Bassaes, Embassadours, and other great men, aswel <hi>Persians</hi> as <hi>Turkes,</hi> that haue beene agentes and dealers in these affaires. The other is, for that I doe verily persuade my selfe, that I shall breede great profite and delight to all nations Christian by the reading of this history, wherein they shall vnderstand how mighty the forces are of these two enimies of the name of Christ; and in what termes they stand euen at this day: by meanes of which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it may peraduenture fall out, that our Christian Princes will bee encouraged to take vp armes against the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> vnder whose gouernement so many famous and potent nations are already reduced. A losse (to say the trueth) very great, and not to be thought-of without shedding of teares, that whereas a people so renowmed for their Nobilitie, &amp; glorious in all ages for wisedome and science, did in times past gouerne so many nations, as though they were Lordes of the whole world: Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either driuen from their proper Colonies, from their owne houses, from their domesticall confines, they goe wandring vp and downe poore, &amp; needy of other mens helpe: Orels being brought into a most vile kind of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude, some serue as sclaues, &amp; some yeeld obedience to the enimies of Christ in such sorte, that euen in <hi>Greece</hi> it selfe, the very name of <hi>Greece</hi> is quite extinguished, and al because it was departed from the bosome of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church. But let not this my history take his beginning at these quarrels and complaintes, which peraduenture to some mens humors would seeme the more vnpleasant, in that they would proue more necessary to be set downe in this respect: And therefore my conceit is rather, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23114:10"/>
in mentioning such thinges as are neerer to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, I should beginne at the death of olde <hi>Tamas</hi> the most famous king of <hi>Persia,</hi> and withall discourse vpon the state and condition of that kingdome whilest it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the successors of the said <hi>Tamas,</hi> videlicet <hi>Isma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hel</hi> and <hi>Mahamet,</hi> his sonnes: for that by this very briefe narration, euery man shall manifestly see the true occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of this warre, and so we shall auoide the inserting of any superfluous replication in the contexture of this our history.</p>
            <p>I say then, that <hi>Tamas</hi> after the warres, which he valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously waged with <hi>Soliman</hi> the first of that name, and the eleuenth Emperour of the Turkes, at such time as the said <hi>Tamas</hi> did driue <hi>Soliman</hi> out of <hi>Tauris</hi> (being of old cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ecbathana,</hi> the very same, wherein <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth, that the kings richesses &amp; treasures were then kept, &amp; not <hi>Terua</hi> as <hi>P.

Vnder whome the Persian Empire flourished in sacred &amp; redoubted lawes, the people demeaned themselues after the best manner they could, abundance of collections came plentifully in, the Rentes of his chambers increased wonderfully, Armes, Artes &amp; Sciences did happely pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and were highly esteemed: neither was there any more feare that <hi>Soliman</hi> would renew the warres, as one that had altogether bent his thoughtes another way.

               </note> foelicity of his Empire, departed out of this lyfe, <hi>Tamas</hi> also himself died in the yeare 1576, the xj. day of May, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing left behind him eleuen children, one called <hi>Mahamet</hi> the eldest, who passed his life a while in <hi>Heri,</hi> (in times past called <hi>Aria,)</hi> and afterwardes in <hi>Siras,</hi> (of old called <hi>Persepolis)</hi> by the appointment of his father, being nowe waxen proud for his issue of many sonnes.

            <p>This <hi>Tamas,</hi> before he dyed, did solemnely appoynt by his will, that his sonne <hi>Ismahel</hi> the elder should bee set <note place="margin">Tamas his last will.</note> in the kingdome: who although, because he was yonger then <hi>Mahamet,</hi> could not bee his lawfull successor, yet did he yeeld great hope of his most excellent wit, and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vertues: insomuch that he seemed to promise euery man an happy gouernment, &amp; sufficient habilitie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himselfe against his enemies, were they neuer so fierce and warlike. <hi>Ismahel,</hi> after that he was confined by his father <hi>Tamas</hi> into the eastel of <hi>Cahaca,</hi> had euer sought to shew himselfe superior to his brother in the Arte mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie: and although he gaue himselfe by secret industrie to learne the preceptes of the Turkish law (a thing which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23114:11"/>
if it had beene publikely knowen, would alone haue beene enough to haue barred him from succession of the kingdome:) yet had he alwayes endeuored himselfe to be <note place="margin">The simulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Isma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hel.</note> an open enemy to the Turkes, and thereupon with his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inuasions (which was the cause of his imprisonment) whiles the peace held betweene <hi>Tamas</hi> and <hi>Soliman,</hi> he was so bould as now &amp; then, contrary to his fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to assault the Territorie of <hi>Erzirum</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all honestie to spoile the townes &amp; castelles of that region withhis sodaine incursions. By meanes whereof he made shew of his great valour to all people, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to his father <hi>Tamas,</hi> who although in outward shew he seemed greatly to mislike those his youthful heates, yet was he dayly confirmed in the opinion, that he carried of him, to name him his successor, thinking verily that of soe great a dignity he would proue himselfe either altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or at lest more worthy then his brother <hi>Mahamet.</hi> Which <hi>Mahamet</hi> (to speake the truth) aswel for the disease <note place="margin">Why Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name Codabanda.</note> of his eyes, whereby for his surname he was called <hi>Coda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banda,</hi> as also for the manner of his life altogether giuen to that ease, which is proper to such as are studious and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly mynded, neuer shewed himselfe sufficient to sway the burden of the Empire,, and to brydle the fiercenesse of his enemies: yea and he protested himselfe that hee <note place="margin">Mahamet lo ueth not the charge of a king.</note> did vtterly abhorre so great a weight, and those so many cares, as are wont to follow so ample and soe many-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied a kingdome.

And besides this errour, (for the which he was presently &amp; sharpely rebuked) after the death of <hi>Tamas,</hi> he with drew himselfe to his sister, most instantly beseeching soe desyred a dignitie at her handes: with whome, as also with the rest of the Counsellors of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state

he had vsed so many prayers &amp; fauours, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce <note place="margin">Aidere procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to bee made king be fore Ismahel.</note> could not be any longer kept from him, but by the helpe of some secret deceit. His sister durst not be so bould, as to moue any important mittigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before the Counsellors, neither would her hart suffer her to set forward any action, that might be preiudicial to her brother <hi>Aidere:</hi> neither could she tell how to permit so great an iniury to be done to <hi>Ismahel,</hi> who was chosen by his father into the succession.

But to these designementes so hasty and so pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, the successes that sprong from the subtilty of those Counsellors, and his dissembling Sister, were nothing conformable: for that by their aduise she tooke order, for the gates of the Pallace to be presently locked, leauing at euery passage asure guarde, and permitting that one narrow wicket onely should remayne open, and safely warded with a company of most faithfull and valorouse Captaines, wholly deuoted to <hi>Tamas &amp; Ismahel,</hi> who had strait charge also giuen them to suffer euery man to enter

            </p>
            <p>Thus then sate the young man <hi>Aidere,</hi> replenished with vnwonted ioyes, receauing honour from al the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Casbin,</hi> sauing onely from his frendes and keepers. By meanes whereof, perceauing now the prohibition of them, and the great stirre of <hi>Zalchan</hi> his chiefest fauorite, (who discouering the prepensed deceit, and crying vpon king <hi>Aidere,</hi> threatned the lady, the <hi>Sultans,</hi> &amp; all the rest that waited vpon this fained succession, which was indeed ordayned but for a scorne &amp; despight of him) he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged this publicke derision, and secretly together with all his misfortune, he abandoned his fresh-begun honors, and of a king (as he presumed to be) he had the grace to <note place="margin">Aidere ackno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging his publike derisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ssieth all fearefull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong certaine women.</note> make himselfe a fugitiue, and being become all fearefull and sorrowfull, with all the force he could he withdrew himselfe closely among certayne women of the pallace, hoping so to find some way to escape with his lyfe.</p>
            <p>In the meane tyme so greatly encreased the cryes and threatnings of the frendly company of <hi>Istigelu</hi> (and now all of them had prepared themselues for some dangerous &amp; pernitious attempt against <hi>Persia)</hi> that the counsellors, with consent of the lady were enforced to take order, that to bereaue these tumultuous and seditious people of all their hope and courage, <hi>Aidere</hi> should be depriued of his lyfe.

hidden among the weomen, and without any stay, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his head by the lockes, cut it quite from his carcase: <note place="margin">Aidere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headded by Sahamal his vncle.</note> and in the place, where <hi>Zalchan</hi> with the rest of vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Aidere</hi> his fauorites stoode crying and threatning, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the greatest medley &amp; thickest presse of the proude conspirators, he flong the head all blouddy, &amp; as it were breathing for heate, crying out vnto them, <hi>Behould there</hi>

            <p>In the meane tyme was <hi>Tamas</hi> buried acording to their prophane rites, and <hi>Ismahel</hi> the successor arriued from <hi>Cahaca,</hi> who without any stirre at all was embraced by his sister, saluted by the <hi>Sultans,</hi> and reuerenced of all men, as the lawfull heire of so great an Empire.

            <p>In this so great an innouation, and among these tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multes, there went abrode with all, an vniuersall rumor, not onely among the Citties of <hi>Persia,</hi> but in the regions of the Turkes also, <hi>(Fame the publisher of euill, rather then of good newer,</hi> arriuing euen to the Citty of <hi>Constantinople)</hi> that with all these disorders, <hi>Ismahel</hi> sought to put in order <note place="margin">A rumor spread that Ismahel would passe to Babilon with an army.</note> a great number of such soldiers, as fauoured this new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed vanity, &amp; passing with them to the citty of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> now called <hi>Bagdat,</hi> there, to the imitation of <hi>Soliman,</hi> would receaue the Crowne of the Empire at the hand of him, that (who soeuer he was) he should find to be the successor of their great <hi>Califfe,</hi> and in the cheefest place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theyr vncleane priestes.

            <p>

But no one thing did more enflame the Turkish Emperour, then did so rare an occasion which he thought was now offered vnto him, to haue for his enemy a king not well practy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in feats of war, besotted &amp; confounded in affection &amp; conceyttowardes his children, and weakened through the dissention of his subiectes: he measured and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his owne forces, he considered the peace which his people had enioyed from the taking of <hi>Goletta,</hi> euen vntill this tyme: he collected the infinite number of his vassalles aswell horsemen as footemen, he surueighed the rentes of his customes, his meanes to fynd money, his engynes of war (wherein he did far surpasse the Persians,) the citties of his enemy layde all open, and without any defence of fyre or by such lyke instruments of death: and in breefe when he had called to mind whatsoeuer he durst attempt and promisse to himselfe, he did more and more resolue with himselfe to take the occasion that was now offered him to begin this warre. For the compassing of which his purpose he was greatly fauoured by the present state <note place="margin">Amurat in peace with the Christian Princes.</note> of Christendome, at that tyme being wholly in league &amp;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23114:19"/>
amity with him: and the peace yet continuing that the Emperour had made with him: and the rather, because <note place="margin">Amurat in peace with the Christian Princes.</note> he was verily perswaded that he should not haue any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance by the Catholike king, who no doubt would graunt him a truce by reason of his warres in <hi>Flanders,</hi> wherewith hee perceiued hee was shrewdly occupied, (which truce afterward ensued by occasion of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Portugall.)</hi> The State of <hi>Venice</hi> also obseruing that faith and promise, which with publike capitulations, they had faithfully established in concluding a peace, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that singular victory, which they had obtayned neere to the Islandes <hi>Echinades</hi> against the Turkish Fleete.

            <p>In this generall tranquillity &amp; common peace with the Potentates of Christendome, did <hi>Amurat</hi> with more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and bouldnes discourse with him selfe about the broaching of this warre in <hi>Persia:</hi> and at last not fynding any thing contrary to his designementes, he resohied to haue a treaty with those chief <hi>Bassaes</hi> called <hi>Visiers</hi> that vse to sit at the Court gate, &amp; to take sound aduise with those <note place="margin">Amurat ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth counsell of his Visiers.</note> that had the vniuersall gouernement of the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre in their handes, whether it were better vpon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasion to begin the prepensed warre, or if they thought this oportunity not to be so fit, then to lay it aside, &amp; to conuert their forces and counselles against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth of Christendome. So impiously and so bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously is this Empyre managed; that whensoeuer there is any treaty to attempt any enterpryse for the aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thereof, it is lawfull to violate any truce and to breake promisse: whereupon although this warre

And if there were any difficultie at all therein, there were but two onely that seemed to be of any weight: one was the great distance <note place="margin">Two difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties found in the resolution to make warre.</note> and rough passage of those places, through which they were to leade their horses, their Cammells, their artillery and their men, euery man knowing that the Country of <hi>Georgia</hi> is compassed rounde about with verie roughe mountaines and thick woods, where the enemy vseth all good oportunity to lay ambushes, and to worke treason against such as passe that way: another difficulty was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>Sinan Bassa</hi> among the rest offering to their consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, that if a man would conquere a new countrey, it was necessary for the mayntenaunce of the conquest to erect Castelles and Fortresses, which being leaft to the defence of valiant souldiers would require large sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, without which euery souldyer willingly forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his charge. Sauing these two difficulties (which <note place="margin">The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> notwithstanding were not greatly debated, but in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere thereof as much spoken by the king himselfe as was thought sufficient) euery man thought the conquest of the kingdome of the <hi>Cheselbas</hi> to bee the playnest &amp; ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syest, &amp; promised to themselues vndoubted victory of it.

hopes of glorious conquestes not concealing the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the <hi>Latines,</hi> &amp; the perilles passed in the wars of the said Islande, and particularly in the expugnation of the Citty, preferring the armes, forces, and valour of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> before the valour, forces, and armes of the <hi>Georgiani</hi> and the <hi>Persians:</hi> and in breefe assuring more certayne <note place="margin">Mustaffa pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre th the valour of the Latines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the valour of the Georgians &amp; Persians.</note> hope of this warre in <hi>Asia,</hi> then of any other that could possibly be raised in <hi>Europe.</hi> And in this sort were the first discourses and originalles of these motions in the East, begun and practised: whereby all men may see that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther zeale of religion, nor any iniury receaued from the Persian Kinges, but onely the ambitious desyre of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> to subdue a kingdome, both in his owne conceyte and also by other mens relation ill gouerned by an effeminate and sottish king, and through ciuill dissention brought into great danger, was the first prouocation of making <note place="margin">Discord dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to a common wealth.</note> this warre: and thereby may all Catholikes learne, that there is nothing more pernitions to the Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, then ciuill discord.</p>
            <p>When they had thus concluded vpon this resolution to make warre in <hi>Persia,</hi> there arose new consultations touching the manner thereof, and vpon what coast they should begin their iourney, that so they might expect the more honorable successe: which poynt <hi>Amurat</hi> did <note place="margin">Amurat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testeth to the Visiers, that of this warre he would both reape profit and honour.</note> greatly vrge, protesting before al his <hi>Visiers,</hi> that he would not enter into a warre, vnlesse he were in great hope to beare away the promised victory. Many were the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions and opinions of the <hi>Visiers:</hi> and many questions did the king propound, whereunto hee himselfe did rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily answere. On the one side some thought, that it wold be very conuenient to send the Army to <hi>Babilon,</hi> and from <note place="margin">The opinion of some tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the manner of the warre.</note> thence to <hi>Syras,</hi> (in old tyme called <hi>Persepolis)</hi> famous
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23114:21"/>
for the praye that <hi>Alexander</hi> tooke there, (as <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> wryteth,) and by that way to attempt the conquest of all <hi>Persia.</hi> Others were of a contrary mind, &amp; did giue aduice, <note place="margin">The opinion of others.</note> that the Army should bee sent by direct course to <hi>Tauris,</hi> there to erect strong fortresses, and to take possession of all the country subiect round about. It is reported also, that some there were that thought it better to send two seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <note place="margin">A third opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> Armyes from both the places aboue mentioned, that so bringing the enemy into a straite, they might inforce him to retire, and to yeeld vnto them whatsoeuer they should demand. But <hi>Amurat</hi> durst not repose such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence <note place="margin">The delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</note> in his owne forces, as to thinke that with his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells deuided &amp; so weakened, he should be able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that enemy, who had alwaies fought most valiantly agaynst the monstrous and couragious Armyes of his forefathers, not without some feare also of the auncyent vertue of the Persian people, whereof Fame hath euer resounded an immortall and glorious report. Neyther did he make slender accompt of the <hi>Georgiani,</hi> the most antique tributaries and confederates of the <hi>Persians,</hi> by whose onely assaultes his Army could not but suffer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inconueniences and sundry trauelles: forsomuch as if they should assaile his battels behind or on both sides, &amp; the <hi>Persians</hi> should set vpon his forefront, though they were many in number and fenced with artillery, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill planted, and in such difficulty as they could not vse their Artillery, it would be a very easy matter to defeate them. And therefore he did firmely resolue with himselfe to send one onely Army, and with vnited forces to seeke the ouerthrow of his enemy. And thus preferring his strong hope to conquere the countrey of <hi>Siruan</hi> in <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> and the chiefe Citties of <hi>Media</hi> the Great, before the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23114:21"/>
difficultie of making warre vpon the coast of <hi>Siras,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing great confidence in the notable helpe that was promised him by the <hi>Cumani</hi> in <hi>Tartaria</hi> called <hi>Precopen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes,</hi> he confirmed his counsellors the <hi>Bassaes</hi> in the same o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion: and withall discouered a matter, which to all of them but especially to <hi>Sinan</hi> seemed most strange, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he was determined not to go in person with his Army about this enterpryse, but was minded to send one <note place="margin">Amurat go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in person to this warre, and the reasons why.</note> of his worthiest Captaines in his steed. The respectes that held <hi>Amurat</hi> from going himselfe with the Armye, were many: but principally the Falling sicknesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee was troubled: the zeale hee did beare to the kingdome, fearing greatly (and that not without good cause) least his sonne being in fauour with the people might peraduenture vntimely be aduaunced before him: and the danger that he suspected at the handes of the Christian Potentates.</p>
            <p>While they were thus in parlee about this expedition, and <hi>Sinan, Mustaffa,</hi> and some other <hi>Visiers</hi> made meanes to bee sent as Vicegerentes and soueraigne ministers of their Lordes designement, he dispatched away sondry postes and light-horsemen with order to the <hi>Bassaes,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, of <hi>Van,</hi> of <hi>Babilan,</hi> of <hi>Erzirum,</hi> in the borders of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> &amp; <hi>Armenia</hi> the greatter, that they should by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">Order giuen by Amurat to the borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to annoy Persia.</note> inroades spoyle the townes and castelles of the <hi>Chesel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> and euery way doo them what harme they could, Which was presently put in execution by them all, and specially by the aboue named <hi>Vstref Bassa</hi> of <hi>Van,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydes <note place="margin">Vstref doth much harme to the borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</note> the burning of dyuerse townes, brought many a soule into slauery, and in the countryes aswell Tributary as subiecte to the <hi>Persians,</hi> made many incursions, and wrought much annoyance.</p>

The Turkes in the meane tyme, by reason of this new deuysed nouelty, thinking themselues to be of a sound and sincere opinion, did alwayes call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues <hi>Sunni,</hi> (that is to say, men of a good faith) and on the other syde they called the Persians <hi>Rafadi,</hi> that is to say, men of a false faith and going-astray, onely because they forsooke those first successors of <hi>Mahamet, Abubacher, Omar &amp; Ottoman,</hi> whom they belieue to bee the lawfull heyres of that cheefe dignity.

to <hi>Mahamet:</hi> But the Persians, although indeed they worship <hi>Aly,</hi> yet for all that they doo not onely not reuerence the other three, but curse them &amp; hate them as impious and damned persons.</p>
            <p>Afterwardes the Persians were called <hi>Cheselbas,</hi> of a certaine red marke which they carried on their heades, <note place="margin">The Persians called Chesel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas.</note> by an ordinance that was instituted for the same by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duelle,</hi> who was esteemed a very holy man.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:23114:33"/>
enlarge the boundes of his kingdome, that, in respect of his greatnes, men will hardely beleeue at this day the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable oppressions, which those Prouinces in truth haue suffered and endured. And herein is <hi>Paulus Giouius</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The errour of P.

            <p>This Persian superstition was first brought in by <hi>Siec Giunet</hi> the <hi>Sofi,</hi> afterward maintayned by <hi>Siec Sederdin,</hi> and <note place="margin">The names of the Successors in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</note> after him by <hi>Siec Giunet</hi> the seconde, then, by <hi>Siec Aider</hi> (called by <hi>Giouius, Arduelle,)</hi> and at last so encreased &amp; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enlarged by <hi>Ismahel</hi> the <hi>Saha</hi> and <hi>Sofi,</hi> that vnder his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment <hi>Persia</hi> seemed to enuy the glory of <hi>Cyrus &amp; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi> After the death of <hi>Ismahel</hi> it descended to <hi>Tamas,</hi> who reygned with lesse felicity then his father did, being many a time and often greatly damnifyed by <hi>Soliman,</hi> and after <hi>Tamas</hi> succeeded <hi>Aidere</hi> the second, who raigned but for certaine dayes and houres, as the Historie setteth it downe: and then followed <hi>Ismahel,</hi> who troubled all the Citties of his kingdom with manifold hurley-burlies: &amp; last of all the king that now is, being more vnfortunate and vnhappy then all the rest. And euen as <hi>Giunet,</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this sect, being a man that was esteemed to be wise and holy, did renew the name of <hi>Sofiti,</hi> which for many ages past had beene extinguished in <hi>Asia,</hi> and in other his successors <hi>Sederdin, Giunet</hi> the second, &amp; <hi>Aidere Sisopi,</hi> who were contented onely with the bare name of <hi>Siec:</hi> so was it agayne reuyued in the sprouting glory of <hi>Ismahel,</hi> who did so largely dilate the confines of his kingdome,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:23114:33"/>
that it seemed he had (as it were) founded it anew: and yet afterwardes, it was suppressed againe in his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors <hi>Tamas, Aidere, Ismahel &amp; Mahamet,</hi> who leauinge the names of <hi>Sofiti</hi> and <hi>Siec</hi> retayned onely the Tytle of <hi>Saha.</hi> In this sort, began encreased and declined, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Persians, who were followers of the diuision and superstition of the false law of <hi>Mahamet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the occasions were, why in so shorte a space, so famous and redoubted a kingdome began to declyne, it shalbe declared hereafter: for that it is now tyme to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the narration of more important matters, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the Geographicall description of the kingdome it selfe: wherein it shall behoue the reader to walke with good circumspection, because the confynes thereof are set downe neyther so ample and large as they were in the tyme of <hi>Ismahel,</hi> nor lesse then they were at such tyme as these warres were moued. For <hi>Ismahel</hi> had in such sorte enlarged the limits of his Empire by his new deuised su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, <note place="margin">The changes of the Persian state.</note> that hee had not onely stretched them on the East beyond <hi>Aria,</hi> and on the South vpon the red sea in the Golfe of <hi>Persia,</hi> but on the West also he had made the <hi>Georgiani</hi> tributaries, subdued the <hi>Armenians,</hi> the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopotamians,</hi> the <hi>Babilonians,</hi> the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and threatned that he would Lorde it euen to the confynes of <hi>Europe.</hi> But this so notable felicity of his continued no long time, because both he himselfe was dispossessed by those that were mightier then he was, and after his death, <hi>Tamas</hi> was so straitly shut vp, euen into the innermost places of his kingdome, that it were but a small matter for wryters to describe the compasse and quantity of that which was left. For being depryued of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and of <hi>Assyria,</hi> the poore Persians had much
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:23114:34"/>
adoo to retaine the people of <hi>Georgia</hi> and <hi>Atropatia</hi> at their commandement and deuotion: but auoyding the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages and incursions of the Turkes, they were inforced to transport their Regall seat to <hi>Casbin,</hi> &amp; to forsake <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> the auncient Pallace not onely of these princes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of all the other kings of those prouinces.</p>
            <p>And therefore setting asyde the first felicity, and large compasse of this kingdome, (the memory whereof can serue to no other purpose then to bewayle so great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, and to teach vs that we ought not to put too much confidence in wordly riches, nor wax proud in the great authority of rule and gouernement:) measuring the state of this realme, as it was when these warres began, we say, that for the North part, beginning at the very vttermost East of the sea of <hi>Baccu,</hi> and coasting all that Sea, and then <note place="margin">The North parte of the Persian king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> entring into <hi>Seruan</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> euen vnto <hi>Mengrelli,</hi> and so a little lower vnto <hi>Chars,</hi> lying in the champaine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try vnder the mountains of <hi>Periardi</hi> called <hi>Chielder,</hi> where also is erected a Castell called <hi>Childerum</hi> for defence of the borders, you haue the description of all that the Persians possesse on that syde. From thence drawing a lyne by the East, and rolling the same ouer the Lake <hi>Actamar,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">The West.</note> 
               <hi>Coy</hi> in the champeine of <hi>Caldaran,</hi> &amp; then carrying the same lyne towardes the South to the Citty of <hi>Salmas,</hi> and a little higher towards <hi>Seresul,</hi> euen to the channell of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> there is comprehended all the West parte of this kingdome.

            </p>
            <p>The compasse appeareth to bee very great and of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, comprehending in it many prouinces, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly famous in our tymes, but also much more glorious in the daies of those Auncients: for that in the West is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the countrey of <hi>Georgia,</hi> parte of <hi>Turcomania,</hi> and of <hi>Cussestan:</hi> in the North, <hi>Seruania,</hi> the countrey of <hi>Gheilan;</hi> and <hi>Massandran:</hi> in the East, <hi>Candahar, Corassan,</hi> and <hi>Heri:</hi> and in the South, all the kingdome of <hi>Fars,</hi> (the cheefe Citty whereof is <hi>Siras,)</hi> with <hi>Caramania</hi> the <hi>Desert.</hi> In the very middle and Centre of this Circle are the Territories of <hi>Casbin, Cassan,</hi> and <hi>Hispahan.</hi> So that in <note place="margin">The prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> the beginning of this warre, the King of <hi>Persia</hi> ruled ouer all these prouinces, <hi>Georgia</hi> sometyme called <hi>Iberia, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uania,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Atropatia, Tauris</hi> with the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries belonging vnto it called in times past <hi>Media</hi> the <hi>Great, Gheilan</hi> or <hi>Gely, Masandran</hi> or <hi>Hircania:</hi> &amp; more inward <hi>Parthia, Aria, Candahar</hi> or <hi>Peripaniso, Farsi</hi> or <hi>Persia,</hi> and parte of <hi>Cussestan</hi> in old tyme called <hi>Assyria.</hi> All these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces in times past subdued by the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> wasted by so many mutations and States, and outrages of Armyes, haue also lost their aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent names, and according to the seuerall languages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vsed, haue had dyuers and sondry appellations, which (as a man may probably coniecture) are in truth those, that are last named.

            <p>
               <hi>Tamas</hi> had vnder him, (and so he left the kingdome to <hi>Ismahel,</hi> in whose time and by whose meanes these warres were raised) threescore and tenne Gouernementes, all bearing the Titles of <hi>Sultans</hi> &amp; <hi>Chan:</hi> so that in his whole Empire, he had seauentie Citties of such state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they deserued to haue a Gouernour of the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie, that the <hi>Bassa</hi> is with the Turkes, as shall be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the exposition of Names.

            <p>There is resident in <hi>Casbin</hi> their prophane Priest cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">The cheefe Priest of Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin called Mustaed-Dini.</note> 
               <hi>Mustaed-Dini</hi> that is to say, the chiefe of the law, who is as the <hi>Mufti</hi> among the Turkes: and in the other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect Citties are certaine peculiar Heades, obedient to this cheefe Priest: who notwithstanding are not chosen or displaced at his pleasure, as our Bishops and prelates are by our most holy <hi>Pope,</hi> the true Viccar of God and pastor of the holy Catholike Church; but by the King himselfe, who, (as we haue said before) should be not onely a king, but also a Priest, euen as <hi>Aly</hi> and <hi>Mahamet</hi> were.

Those three Sultanes that remaine at <hi>Casbin</hi> for the generall gouernement of the <note place="margin">The Sultans.</note> whole Empire, haue their seuerall distinct charges.

and the other two gather vp all the reuenues, and keepe a diligent reckoning thereof: which two may be rather cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Treasurers then any thing els, such as the Turkes call <hi>Deftardar.</hi> Next vnto them there are at <hi>Casbin</hi> two great <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>But as concerning the state of their warres and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, <note place="margin">The state of the men of warre in Persia.</note> it cannot bee precysely and particularly descrybed, neither in respect of their forces, nor of their weapons, nor of the manner of their fight: and yet will wee set downe that little which we know for certaine. The soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of this kingdome would in truth be very many and terrible, if al those places, which we haue comprised with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe therof, as they are accompted, so they were indeed obedient to this crowne, and if also all those fables could be verified of it, that are dyuersly reported by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wryters, of so many horsemen &amp; so many footemen. But for somuch as not onely the Tributaries, but also the very naturall subiects doo not send in their ordinary and due aydes and succours, hereupon it springeth that in all their occasions their forces prooue so weake, and their Armies of a very small nomber. Of the discordes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions in <hi>Georgia,</hi> which haue now bene tried by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to haue bene no lesse hurtful to them selues, then to the <hi>Persians,</hi> we haue already spoken asmuch as may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: and now we will speake of some others, beginning
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:23114:44"/>
with <hi>Amet-Chan,</hi> who hath a long time been Lord of <hi>Ghei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</hi> This man, although he were of hability to haue yeelded singular aide to this crowne, (it being the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <note place="margin">Amet-Chan.</note> opinion of all men, that he could gather together xx. thousand horse) yet could hee neuer be induced to serue in warre, but rather enioying a base and infamous lyfe, he is become both vyle to himselfe, and vnprofitable and hatefull euen to his neighbours &amp; kinsfolkes. For which cause king <hi>Tamas,</hi> when hee was free from the Turkish <note place="margin">Amet-Chan imprisoned by Tamas &amp; enlarged by Mahamet.</note> warres, employed all his forces against him, and followed him so hardly, that in the end hee tooke him prisoner, &amp; so kept him till he dyed, which was for the space of xv. yeares. But assoone as the now king <hi>Mahamet</hi> was inthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized in his kingdome, being carried away with a vaine and foolish pittie, hee deliuered him out of prison, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping (lyke an vnwyse man as he was) that this most co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous and suspicious wretch would haue proued curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and kynd towardes him, which was a thing quyte contrary to his nature and disposition. And behold, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoseuerity of <hi>Tamas,</hi> nor the lenity of <hi>Codabanda,</hi> could euer perswade him to change his mynd: for in the greatest daungers of this present warre hee could neuer tynde in his hart to apply himselfe to the performance of any noble acte, that was not only worthy of his great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but also especially required by the present necessities.</p>
            <p>The like treacherie shewed <hi>Rustan Mirize,</hi> the king of <note place="margin">Rustan Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize.</note> 
               <hi>Candahar,</hi> and sonne to a brother of king <hi>Tamas,</hi> who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for neerenesse of bloud, nor for common honour, nor for the estimation and reputation of his owne super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, could euer be wrought to pitty the calamities of <hi>Persian:</hi> and yet the kingdome of <hi>Candahar</hi> was very well hable to gather about xxv. thousand horse: Neither may
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:23114:44"/>
his excuses auaile him, that he alleadged touching the far distance of his countrey: For if distaunce of place was no hinderaunce to the enimie to bring his Armies euen to <hi>Tauris,</hi> to annoy the <hi>Persians:</hi> Lesse reason had <hi>Rustan Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize</hi> to withdraw his ready forces fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> defending his frends, the iourney from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Tauris</hi> beeing no shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then it is thither from <hi>Candahar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Like vnto these was, and still is <hi>Emir-Miran</hi> the Lord of <hi>Iest,</hi> a hard man, and very obstinate in coueteousnesse, <note place="margin">Emir-Miran.</note> who doth not onely not send any voluntarie aide, but also refuseth to pay those tributes which by couenant &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position he is bound to send: And yet is he able to yeeld foure or fiue thousand horse of great valour in warre.</p>
            <p>The Lord of <hi>Lar</hi> also, called <hi>Ebrain-Chan,</hi> famous for <note place="margin">Ebrain-Chan.</note> his mightinesse, although in times past hee hath alwayes helped the common forces with his priuate succours, yet at this day he vtterly denieth both the one and the other, and threateneth rather to suppresse all Estates, then to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce and encrease any that belong to this crowne.</p>
            <p>But aboue al the rest, me thinketh that <hi>Abas Mirize</hi> this kinges sonne is most impious and wicked, who not onely <note place="margin">Abas Mirize.</note> would neuer fauour his fathers enterprises against the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell enimies of the common libertie, but also hath sought by all meanes possible to driue both his brethren and his father out of the State, and to enter himselfe into the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession and gouernement of this diuided and troubled kingdome. So that vnder his Iurisdiction there are idlely fed eighteene thousand horse, which would prooue very stout and strong in warre, if they wanted not discipline.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Cussestan,</hi> those <hi>Arabians</hi> that were wont to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for any seruice to the Persian kinges, haue yeelded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:23114:45"/>
to the Persians by their suddaine incursions. But within the very bowels of the kingdome, the <hi>Turcoman</hi> nation, that would haue beene a great strength to these <note place="margin">Turcomania.</note> forces, if they would haue ioyned with them, Behold, how it hath not failed to procure many ouerthrowes to this kingdome: a great parte whereof we haue described in the fourth booke of this history. The kingdome of <hi>Seruan</hi> also is in such sort spoyled and decayed, that the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <note place="margin">Seruan.</note> of <hi>Sumachia, Eres, Sechi, Derbent</hi> and others, out of which there was wont to bee leuied a good reasonable nomber of people, as also <hi>Reiuan, Teflis,</hi> and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Georgia</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> are not able to yeeld any succours in the time of warre: so that the Crowne of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> beeing depriued of such and so many helpes, is at this day constrayned to wage warre with very slender forces, which very briefly shall be heere set downe.</p>
            <p>Out of <hi>Hispahan,</hi> and the territorie thereof, (to reckon their Stipendiaries to the vttermost) they leauie eight <note place="margin">The forces of the Persian kingdome, whose seruice may be vsed.</note> thousand souldiers on horseback: out of <hi>Bargo,</hi> two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand: out of <hi>Cassan,</hi> foure thousand: out of <hi>Seua,</hi> one thousand: out of <hi>Sultania,</hi> one thousand: out of <hi>Casbin,</hi> twelue thousand: out of <hi>Ardouil,</hi> one thousand: out of <hi>Siras</hi> eight thousand: out of <hi>Tauris</hi> foure thousand: out of <hi>Cum</hi> and <hi>Cuohiue-Tauris</hi> two thousand: out of <hi>Genge</hi> &amp; the rest of <hi>Georgia,</hi> foure thousand. Besides these they may hire others, when their occasions do so require, and they haue alwaies volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary souldiers, &amp; that in som good nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber so that the greatest Armie that they can possibly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will hardly amount to threescore thousand horse: (alwayes prouided that euery cittie aforenamed do send in their Stipendiarie Souldiers according to their duety.) Whereas if all the other Capitaines, that are noted aboue
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:23114:45"/>
to be obstinate and rebellious, would agree and concurre in one vnitie, they might make an hoast of an hundred &amp; thirty or an hundred and forty thousand persons or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboutes.</p>
            <p>Their Souldiers are armed for the most parte with Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitarre, <note place="margin">The weapons of the Persian souldiers.</note> Launce, and Darte, but specially, the Scimitarre is most familiar vnto them, and all the Persians do make a singular profession and vse of it: although there want not among them some that can handle the Arcubuse also, the exercise whereof hath of late yeares growen more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and vsuall, then it was in the time of <hi>Ismahel,</hi> and in the first yeares of the raigne of king <hi>Tamas.</hi> For their owne defence they are armed with good Corselets, and strong helmets, many of them able to keepe out an Arcubuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot, much more to daunt the force of a Darte: Some of their horses also are armed with very good Armour, most finely and soundly tempered. And these their horses are <note place="margin">The Persian horses very good.</note> of a singular vertue, equall with those of the old time, which (as <hi>Strobe</hi> writeth) were accustomed to be fed and brought vp in <hi>Armenia</hi> for their kings vse.

In the right horne or wing, by auncient custome were <note place="margin">The right wing.</note> placed those troupes that were guyded by the captaynes of <hi>Istigelu,</hi> which is now called the Traytors lyne, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Zalchan</hi> and the rest, that were so ready &amp; resolute in the conspiracy, which was made in the fauour of <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> whereof we haue already written in this history. In the left cornet or wing were placed the people that were <note place="margin">The least wing.</note> led by the captaines <hi>Zambeluzes,</hi> who vaunt of their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient discent from <hi>Damasco,</hi> and from the <hi>Tacaluzes,</hi> a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neuer greatly esteemed for any valour or knowledge that they had in warfare. In the body of the battel was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the kings guard, who was alwaies accustomed to <note place="margin">The body of the battell.</note> be present at warre with his Armies, although this king partly by reason of the infirmity of his eies, and partly for the dissentions in his kingdome durst not venture to goe in person, but in his steed sent Prince <hi>Amze,</hi> a valorous &amp; good warrier. In the middest of the battell also, about the King, went the people of <hi>Ausares,</hi> which are pressed out of <hi>Persia,</hi> all of them accounted very warrelike, and more valiant then all the rest. Neyther would it bee greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse to thinke that from hence were those troupes fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in tymes past, which <hi>Xerxes</hi> was wont to terme by that proude tytle <hi>Immortall,</hi> the immortall souldiers. The Rere-ward was kept by those that descended from <hi>Calir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Rere-ward.</note> which were neuer as yet depryued of that honour, for the good desertes that <hi>Calirchan</hi> shewed to <hi>Ismahel,</hi> when he strained himselfe, to passe with a mighty Army
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:23114:47"/>
euen into <hi>Cafe,</hi> to performe the Regall Ceremonies at his Coronation, and yet for all that neuer stirred the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry guarde of <hi>Casbin.</hi> The people of <hi>Caribdiler</hi> and <hi>Chia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peris</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Vaunt-Guarde.</note> made-vp the Vaunt-Guarde, accompted also to be men of good sort and very warlike, because they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies shewed themselues ready in any occasions or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of warre, and performed their partes very valiantly. And this was the manner of ordering their battelles in late tymes.</p>
            <p>Touching the reuenues of this kingdome, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion is, that in the dayes of Kinge <hi>Tamas</hi> the <note place="margin">The Reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ues of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia in the daies of king Tamas.</note> crowne did yearely receaue into the Chamber of <hi>Casbin,</hi> foure or fiue millions of gold, which afterward he caused to be worth eight millions, by a sudden enhaunsing of the value of his coyne, geuing in commandment by most seuere Edictes, that ouer all his Empyre, for a certayne space, all the money that he had receaued, should bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and accompted for asmuch more as it was worth, and accordingly made pay to his souldiers and <hi>Sultans,</hi> &amp; all other that were in his pay. Which example (mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes) was well followed by <hi>Amurat</hi> the now-king of <note place="margin">The practise of the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an &amp; Turkish kings, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunsing and abasing the value of their moneis.</note> the Turkes, who receauing at the Citty of <hi>Cairo</hi> the <hi>Cechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> of gold for xliii. <hi>Maidini,</hi> he put it out againe in <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> to pay his <hi>Capigi</hi> and <hi>Ianissaries,</hi> withall lxxxv. <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dini,</hi> commanding that it should be of that value ouer all the Citty, and countryes subiect vnto it. But in the dayes of this king of <hi>Persia,</hi> the reuenues of this crowne are thought to be so much diminished, that it is the opinion <note place="margin">The reuenues of Persia at this day.</note> of all men, they amount to little more then two millions in all. Neither is there to be found in him that industry &amp; prouidence which was in <hi>Tamas,</hi> and though it were, yet peraduenture it would not be regarded by his subiects: &amp;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:23114:47"/>
it seemeth that the occasion of this decay is the losse of so many countries as <hi>Soliman</hi> conquered, and particularly <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> and <hi>Assyria,</hi> besydes <hi>Erzirum</hi> and the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes that are denyed by the people of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations of this kingdome. Next after this kinde of reuenue, which is payed in ready money, and collected into the Chamber of <hi>Casbin</hi> from among the Citties that are subiect vnto it: (although all the countrey, that was possessed by these kinges, were not appoynted by diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the payment of a certayne nomber of souldiers, as the Turke vseth to doo in those Countries that he subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:) yet is there a great sort of towns and villages which <note place="margin">Certain lands assigned for the payment of the Persian souldiers.</note> are very Feudataries to the croune of <hi>Persia,</hi> &amp; are so many that they supply a part of the pay that is due to the horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men aboue mentioned, to foure thousande of the <hi>Curchi</hi> of <hi>Casbin,</hi> and to the <hi>Esahul</hi> aforenamed. Among all the reuenues that are gathered out of the Citties subiect <note place="margin">The greatest reuenues com out of Tauris, Cassan and Hispahan.</note> to <hi>Casbin,</hi> the greatest were alwaies payed out of <hi>Tauris, Cassan, &amp; Hispahan,</hi> all Citties of great traffike, where the marchandise of <hi>Europe</hi> &amp; all <hi>Asia</hi> doo arriue. And these are the reuenues of this Crowne.</p>
            <p>The expenses briefely are these. The threescore and <note place="margin">The expenses of the Persian kingdome.</note> ten <hi>Sultanes,</hi> that serue in the gouernement of the subiect Citties, are payed in ready money out of the Chamber of <hi>Casbin,</hi> with a stipend of three thousand, foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, or fiue thousand <hi>Cecchins</hi> a peece. The two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Curchi,</hi> that remaine to be paide for their attendance, (who haue no landes assigned to them for their pay, as the foure thousand abouenamed haue) doe also receiue their ordinary wages out of the kinges Chamber, from a hundred &amp; threescore, to two hundred <hi>Cecchins</hi> a man. From thence also are defraied the stipends for the magis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracyes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:23114:48"/>
of the Iudges, not onely of <hi>Casbin</hi> but of all the whole empire, &amp; all the Treasurers likewise. Wherof some haue a thousand, some fiue hundred, and some a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and fiue hundred <hi>Cecchins</hi> yearely. The Garnisons of certayne Fortes, as of <hi>Elegie</hi> neere to <hi>Nassiuan, Guuergi-Chalassi, Cahaca-Calassi</hi> and such like, consisting some of a <note place="margin">Fortes that haue neede of ordinary Garrisons.</note> thousand and fiue hundred persons, some of a thousand, and some of fiue hundred, are payed with these Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, and euery Souldier of them receiues for his pay fiue <hi>Cecchins</hi> a moneth little more or lesse. I do not heere reckon the expenses that go out for the pay of other base Offices, of his household, of the Queene, of the Prince, of his Children, of the Temples called their <hi>Moschees,</hi> of the buildinges, of the gardens, and such like: and so I leaue you to make an accompt, how much remaineth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and aboue, for the king to put vp in his purse yearely.</p>
            <p>And now hauing respect to the order of those thinges, which I propounded to my selfe to treate-of, there rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing els, but onely briefely to consider the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, whereby it is come to passe, that a kingdom so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelously encreased is so suddenly decreased and decaied. <note place="margin">The occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the declination of the Persian kingdome.</note> And we think the principall occasions therof were three. The first, because the enemy did in very short space waxe verie strong and mightie, by the great conquestes that he made both by sea and by land: by meanes whereof it fell out that those calamities and assaultes, wherewith <hi>Persia</hi> was at sondry tymes dyuersly afflicted and trauelled, did alwaies proue very grieuous and mortall vnto it. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond because the empyre of <hi>Persia</hi> had no fenced citties, that were able to hold out or maintaine themselues: and if there were any, as <hi>Van</hi> was one, it was because they knew not how to fynd the meanes, either to maintayne,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:23114:48"/>
or to recouer themselues: And who knoweth not, that the country lying open, without any resistance, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the huge forces of the Turke, but also farre lesse forces had beene able to worke these mischeefes, yea and farre greater then these are. The third, is the conquest of all Artes that the Turke hath made in the winning and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of so many christian citties, which are replenished with al kind of diligent study &amp; arte. By which conquests the Turke hath not onely learned to vse his wonted and natiue weapons after a more mortall and deadly manner: but also hath inuented new, to the great astonishment &amp; te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rour of his enemy, who hath not onely neglected to make vse of forraine instructions, and to learne the true meanes, to encrease his owne forces, but (as it were) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning all other mens wittes; hath thought himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone able to teach and instruct others. And this is that haultinesse and ambitious conceite of the Persian, who in this present misery of his owne, vaunteth &amp; braggeth of great matters, though all the world can see nothing but most vnhappy euentes in all his warres. The fourth is the concord and celerity of the Turke, whereby he hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted whatsoeuer he would, and hath obtayned what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he attempted: yea and oftentimes, before the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians could take their Armour, he hath taken their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes. The fifte, which is the roote and fosterer of all the rest, hath alwayes beene the discord and dissention in the kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the keeping aliue of so many bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren or nephewes of the king at once: and not onely the keping of them aliue, but also the maintaining of them in authority, in gouernement, and in maiesty. For hereby it came to passe that all counselles and execution of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes were diuided, Armies weakened, Captaines minds
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:23114:49"/>
suspended, and inclyning to dyuers parties, &amp; to be briefe there followed a meere confusion of all thinges. It is in deed a barbarous and inhumaine thing for one brother to dye his crowne &amp; Scepter with the bloud of another, and oftentymes of so many of his breethren, and out of all doubt it is a very harde and cruell position, that a man shall not be able to rule without the making away of his deerest frendes: But yet on the other syde it cannot bee but too much negligence and lenity, to permit that bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and children, being of speciall ambition waxen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer proude in their owne conceytes by reason of their princely gouernementes and authorities, should stirre-vp armes one against another, and in the meane while scarce leaue any meanes for the poore king to scape with his life: who being by his owne bloud made (euen as it were) a rebell to the honour and quyet of the kingdome, must needes reduce his empire into a most vnhappy state. Both these kyndes of gouernementes, are in extremities, and therefore infected with vice and barbarisme, and not to be exercised by any man. And although <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> saith, that <hi>Great enterpryses, which are recompensed with the proffit and safety of the Commonwealth, may haue some iniquity or vnlawfulnesse in them:</hi> notwithstanding euery Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an prince ought by all meanes to auoide them, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish the quyetnesse of his kingdome, neither with too great cruelty, nor with excessiue lenity, in which two poyntes all the Barbarian kinges doo ordniarily offend. <note place="margin">An aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the reader.</note>

            <p>I had heere made an end of this booke, had there not beene brought vnto me certaine bookes, some written in French and some in the Latin tongue, some with the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of commentaries, and some of an History, vnder the names of dyuers Authours more Poeticall then Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:23114:49"/>
as faras I can gather: in which bookes hauing found many wantes, aswell concerning matters of the Persian and Turkish opinions about their lying religion, as also touching the recognition of certaine auncient citties, the tymes wherein things haue happened, the actions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, the voyages of the armies, and many other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities, I thought it my dutye to admonishe all those, that after this our age shall happen to reade those bookes and this history, that they walke verye circumspectly in reading such writings. And especially let them take great heed, that they doo not belieue these things following: namely, That the Turkes follow <hi>Aly,</hi> and the Persians follow <hi>Omar</hi> and <hi>Abubacher:</hi> for the matter is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Likewise, that <hi>Scutar</hi> was in old tyme <hi>Chrysopolis,</hi> whereas it is a most cleere case that it was <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the founders whereof were termed blynde, because they did not see what errour they committed in buylding a Citty there, and leauinge the place where <hi>Constantinople</hi> nowe standeth, as farre excelling the situation of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as gold excelleth leade. Also that <hi>Esrum</hi> or <hi>Erzirum,</hi> as it should be called, is a citty of <hi>Assyria,</hi> whereas indeed it is not a citty of <hi>Assyria,</hi> but of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> if we speake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. That <hi>Seruan</hi> is the auncient <hi>Media,</hi> it being in truth <hi>Atropatia.</hi> That <hi>Osman Bassa</hi> tooke <hi>Teflis, Mustaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa</hi> himself being there in person with all hys hoast, &amp; not (as one of them saith) <hi>Citra memorabile damnum,</hi> without any memorable losse, no, not with any losse at all, because he found it emptie. That <hi>Mustaffa,</hi> poysoned himselfe voluntarily, which he did not indeede, but fell into an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexie. And many other such tales, wherof it is not now conuenient to make any particular confutation. And therefore passing them ouer, wee will prosecute our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer order of this History.</p>

            <p>The Turkish Armie followed-on their begonne iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney towardes <hi>Siruan:</hi> and in the space of twelue dayes, after their departure from <hi>Teflis,</hi> traueiling allwayes tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough low and moorish wayes, that were intricate by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of reedes and myre, they arriued in the confines of the <hi>Medians,</hi> otherwise called the <hi>Siruanians,</hi> neere to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of <hi>Canac,</hi> where of in the desoription of <hi>Georgia, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> and <hi>Atropatia,</hi> we made but a short, &amp; yet a plaine <note place="margin">Mustaffa and his host at the riuer Canac.</note> &amp; manifest mention. Somewhat on this side of the same riuer, the Turkes ascended a little higher, being very wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with the long iourney that they had made, and rested themselues one whole day, in which time the Subiectes of the Cittie of <hi>Sechi</hi> bordering vppon the <hi>Siruanians</hi> and <note place="margin">The subiectes of Sechi come to offer themselues to the captaine.</note> the <hi>Georgiani,</hi> foure dayes iourney distant from <hi>Sumachia,</hi> came to offer themselues to <hi>Mustaffa,</hi> as vassalles and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes to the Turke: All which were gladly entertayned, and some of the chiefe of them apparelled in silkes and gold, and honoured with great magnificence, and in the end had all protection promised vnto them.</p>
            <p>The Turkish Armie, as I haue told yee, was all fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weatied with the continuall iourney of twelue dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: but yet farre more afflicted with hunger, hauing <note place="margin">The hunger of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Army.</note> not found in those parts so much as one wild beast, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might quench their desire of meate; so that there was not a man among them, but sought meanes to get
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:23114:54"/>
some store of victuaile, especially when they vnderstood, that <hi>Mustaffa</hi> was resolued to passe ouer <hi>Canac,</hi> and enter into a new countrey, vnknowne to them all, and where they knew not what hope to conceaue of finding any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance fitte for them. And whiles they were enquiring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues, who was able to conduct them into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place where they might finde reliefe, behold, there were certaine Persians taken, (whether they were there by chaunce, or brought thither for some Stratageme, I <note place="margin">The Persian spyes taken.</note> know not,) who beeing demaunded where they might haue corne and meate to slake the hunger of the Armie, after much resistaunce, and at the last told them, that not <note place="margin">The intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that the spyes gaue for vittaile.</note> farre from the Campe, after they had passed certaine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, where <hi>Canac</hi> dischargeth it selfe, and runneth into <hi>Araxis,</hi> they should finde many fieldes, full of ryse and corne in the blade, and a little farther, certaine fat heardes of cattell feeding, that would bee sufficient to satisfie the appetites of all their people. Of this newes was <hi>Mustaffa</hi> certified, and although hee greatly doubted the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his enimies, and the subtleties of the Persians, yet to gratifie his souldiers, and to make them the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow him in his passage to <hi>Siruan,</hi> hee licensed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery <note place="margin">Mustaffa ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenceth euery man that would go for corne and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> man, that had any desire thereunto, to goe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide them selues of victuails, &amp; so suffered all that would, to goe freely. When the Captaine had graunted them this licence, many <hi>Spahini,</hi> many <hi>Zaini,</hi> and some <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giacchi</hi> also, sent diuers me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fetch this prouision of corne and cattell. And there went for that purpose about tenne <note place="margin">Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand seruile persons go for victuaile.</note> thousand seruile persons, with many Camels, horses, and mules to carry the pray.</p>
            <p>But the successe fel out quite contrary to their designe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: for <hi>Tocomac, Alyculi-Chan, Emanguli-Chan, Serap-Chan,</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:23114:54"/>
and all the rest of the Souldiers, that escaped out of the ouerthrow giuen them by <hi>Mustaffa</hi> in the plaines of <hi>Chielder,</hi> (after they had with all diligence made report to their king at <hi>Casbin</hi> of the issue of this battel in those cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paines) hauing gathered together so many of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as were left them, able to endure the difficulties of warfare, &amp; hauing recouered such places as they thought safe and frendly for them, did alwayes lie in awaite to know the marching and passing of the Turkish Armie. And at last, beeing certainely infourmed by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes of <hi>Reiuan</hi> and <hi>Georgia,</hi> what way they kept, and that of necessitie they must needes arriue at the bankes of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,</hi> they beganne to deuise some notable Stratageme, whereby they might reuenge the great boldnesse of their <note place="margin">The Persian Captaines take counsell how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy the Turkes.</note> enimies, and make this their entrie into <hi>Siruan</hi> very daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and dammageable to them. And yet hauing ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courage nor force sufficient to assault the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, they resolued with themselues, (as men that had sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke inough to attempt great matters,) to stay in priuie ambush at some fit place, till some bande of the Turkish Armie should arriue, where the pray of corne and cattell might allure some of them to descend into those fieldes to relieue their common necessities: and so they sent out di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers <note place="margin">The strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme of the Persians.</note> men, who fayning that they went about their owne businesses, made shew as though they had suddeinly and at vnwares lighted vpon the Turkish Campe, and reuealed vnto them, as a great secrete, what a good pray was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by them. And so withdrawing themselues out of the way, they stayed priuily to watch, when the Turks would send their victuailers to fetch away the corne &amp; cattell: when as, within the space of three onely dayes, it so fell out that the foresaide ten thousand seruile persons arriued at the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:23114:55"/>
place, where they had no sooner begun to charge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with their pray, but they were surprized by the Persians, and sauing a very few, that were nimble at flight, they were all slaine, and left both their pray and their liues <note place="margin">The ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand victuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers shame by the Persians.</note> behind them. The noise of their crie, and the thunder of their Gunnes was heard in the Turkish hoast, which made <hi>Mustaffa</hi> to imagine, that the matter was fallen out, euen as in deede it was, &amp; therefore presently mounting on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and raysing his whole Armie, euery man desirous of reuenge, ranne with bridle on the horse-necke to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the poore people that were already slaine. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">Mustaffa run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with all his hoast to succour the victuailers.</note> the Turkes came not in so good time, as to yeeld them any aide, yet came they very fitly to surprise the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> who beyond all honesty and duetie were ouer-busie in loading themselues, and carrying away the pray that they had recouered.</p>
            <p>The place, where the corne was gathered, was as it were almost an Islande, watered with two riuers, <hi>Araxis,</hi> and <hi>Canac,</hi> which with a little compasse fetched-about, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth it selfe with a very deepe channell into <hi>Araxis.</hi> On the side of <hi>Araxis,</hi> which was the left side of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish hoast, <hi>Dreuis Bassa</hi> kept one wing: on the side of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The order of Mustaffa his battaile.</note> being the right side, did <hi>Beyran Bassa</hi> holde another wing: and <hi>Mustaffa</hi> himselfe led the middle of the battell. which if the <hi>Persians</hi> would not haue encountred, then should they haue beene constrayned to haue runne and drowned themselues either in <hi>Canac,</hi> or in <hi>Araxis.</hi> Assone then as the Persian Captaines had descried <hi>Mustaffa</hi> with all his forces making hast towardes them, and saw such a multitude of souldiers, of ensignes, of speares, and of fyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, and with all remembred the late ouerthrow in the Champaines of <hi>Chielder,</hi> then beganne they to beethinke
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:23114:55"/>
themselues how much better it had beene for them to <note place="margin">The Persians repent their long aboade.</note> haue vsed more speede in departing out of that Demy-Island, and so with suddaine dispatch avoiding their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies forces to haue contented themselues with the late slaughter of those sclauish and seruile people, and not to haue stayed for so vnequall and importunate assault. And being excited therevnto by a certaine intrinsicall and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue vertue, they discoursed among themselues, whether it were better for them to flie, or with so great disaduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to ioyne battell with them, and rather to die with an honorable death, then to liue with reproache of a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full flight. At the last, whiles euery man was thus tossed <note place="margin">
                  <p>Great thoughtes that troubled the Persians.</p>
                  <p>The Persians resolue to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the fight, and to flye.</p>
               </note> with the tempestes of thoughtes, they resolued vtterly to preserue themselues for the state of Persia, and to continue their liues for the great and waighty affaires of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: deeming it rather to be a point of high wisedome, then of shame, not to lay open their security and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their publike and priuate causes, to most certaine and vndoubted losses, and miserable issues.</p>
            <p>But in taking their prepensed flight they discouered <note place="margin">Difficulties in taking their flight.</note> new difficulties: for that they were in such sort straighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within the saide Demy-Island, as they had none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground left, but onely that, which beyond their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations the Turkes had already possessed, and so being greatly perplexed with these troubles, euery man began to betake themselues to their owne priuate conceites. <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comac</hi> and <hi>Emir-Chan,</hi> with other Capitanes of the army were the first that tourned their backes, and some by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <note place="margin">The Persian Capitaines saue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the tiues.</note> and some by swimming passed ouer <hi>Canac,</hi> beinge greatly holpen by the valour and agilitie of their aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous and gallant horses. The example of these Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines moued many other to doo the lyke, though with
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23114:56"/>
a contrary fortune: for that their horses being out of breath and windlesse, there remained a great nomber of them drowned in the waters. At which fearefull specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <note place="margin">The Persians drowned in the Riuer.</note> others being amased, euen as it were in a headlong rage &amp; fury, perceiuing that if they should fly, vnavoydea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble death was present before their eies, setled all their trust in resisting, and reposing all their hope euen in despaire, they shewed vnspeakeable actes of valor in fighting. But what can one doo against a hundred? For they also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great adoo were all destroyed, though with lucke and fame farre vnlike their fellowes. But what helpeth <note place="margin">The Persians in fight shew great signes of valour.</note> Fame in such a medley, where the names of those are not knowne, that either fight manfully or flie effeminately? Others at last resolued to yeeld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues without draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sword or bending bowe, imagining that by so doing they might recouer themselues, together with such spoiles and riches, as they had, whatsoeuer they were. But what benefite can gold and precious stones be to a few in the tumult and confusion of many conquerours, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing geuen rather to vniust rauening then to vpright piety, <note place="margin">
                  <p>Conquerours doo but little regard their promises, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing geuen to spoile.</p>
                  <p>The Demye Island made the perpetual graue of a couragious &amp; warlike people.</p>
               </note> doo but hardly make accompt of their promises, much lesse to be liberall of that which they haue not promised? In this sort did the Persian armie rest discomfited and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied: &amp; so this Demy-Island being first stayned with the bloud of the enemy, &amp; afterward with the slaughter of the neighbour and proper inhabitant, was the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall sepulcher of a couragious and warlike people.</p>
            <p>The Persian Capitaines fled away in great sorrow and affliction for their vnexpected ouerthrowe, and knowing now assuredly whether the designementes of the Turkes tended, who were already turned towardes <hi>Siruan,</hi> they resolued in as ill plight as they were, to retourne home to

their places of aboad, which they had forsaken, and to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the king in <hi>Casbin</hi> therof with all speed, to the end that (if he could) he should send such prouision as might bee sufficient to annoy the enemies army: whereof (as <hi>Emir Sultan</hi> a Marchant of <hi>Azemia,</hi> of great traffike, of a very sincere mynd and affection, and a man of free speech; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my very familiar frend, hath often tymes confessed vnto me in <hi>Aleppo) Tocomac</hi> fayled not to write vnto his king, that there was slaine of the Turkes a great nomber: and so meaning to excuse his late ouerthrow, &amp; to make his losse to seme more tollerable, he made shew of a great slaughter of the Turks in this second battell also: although in very deed, with the miserable and totall destruction of his owne slender Armye, the losse of the Turkes in this fight did not exceede the nomber of three thousande be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <note place="margin">The losse of the Turkes in this battell.</note> the slaughter of ten thousand victuailers.

            </p>
            <p>In the meane while the Turkes had retired themselues againe to their Tentes, from whence by occasion of this vnexpected battell they were sodenly raised, &amp; now was <hi>Mustaffa</hi> with all his troupe arriued at the bankes of the riuer <hi>Canac</hi> on the same syde, where he must beginne to passe ouer, as before is mentioned. For being mynded to go vp to the Cittie of <hi>Eres,</hi> which first of all offreth it selfe to your sight, when ye trauell on that syde to <hi>Suma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:23114:57"/>
there was no remedy but he must needes passe ouer the foresayde water of <hi>Canac:</hi> a thing very displeasant to the whole Army, and yet could not bee auoyded, if hee would execute the commandementes of his king. And therefore (fall out whatsoeuer could fall) making strayte proclamation ouer all the hoast, that euery man should <note place="margin">Mustaffa commandeth all his hoast to passe ouer the Riuer Canac.</note> bee ready the next day to wade ouer the riuer, he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himselfe for that passage. At this proclamation soden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all his people arose in a tumult, with great pride ranne beefore the Generall, with iniurious termes reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his folly and inhumanity, protested vtter daunger to <note place="margin">The souldiers in a tumult threaten Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staffa.</note> himselfe, and vniuersall confusion to the whole army, &amp; to be briefe, praied him that he would surcease from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding any furder, vnlesse he would replenish the whole campe with carcasses &amp; spoiles. But neither could their threatnings nor yet their entreaties any thing moue the resolute mynde of the Generall, who gaue them none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answere but this: <hi>That so had</hi> Amurat <hi>appointed: that</hi>

               <hi>if all the rest should shew themselues vnwilling to obey their soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, he would not, and in duty thought hee could not doo the lyke, but in truth would be the first man to attempt and performe that which all they so abhorred and reproued: That not in Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; ease, but in great paine and difficult enterprises true soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are discouered, who ought neuer to be afrayde of chaunging brittle lyfe with euerlasting honour, nor to auoide death, if it should happen, for the seruice of their King. And for his owne part he did most earnestly pray them, that after he had attempted the passage of the water, if any thing hapned to him otherwise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well and to be alyue, then he might bee carried dead to the other syde of the riuer, to the end that if hee could not execute the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of his King, whiles he was alyue, yet he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the same at least, when he was but a speechlesse and a lyfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse</hi>

But this passage being attempted with very great tumult and disorder, &amp; no regard had to the places that were wade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, it came to passe, that about eight thousand persons, <note place="margin">8000.

            <p>With great complaintes and blasphemous cursinges was the whole night spent on this syde <hi>Canac,</hi> and euery man being euen desperate knew not what to doo to auoid that dangerous passage, whose feare and griefe the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their vnfortunate fellowes that were drowned did greatly increase: And no doubt some pestilent sedition had ensued thereupon, that would haue bredde much harme to the Turkish affayres, if by the death and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:23114:58"/>
of those that were drowned, there had not beene discouered a shallow Forde, that assured safe passage to those that were left: wherin they were much more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py then their former fellowes, in that their delay had wrought them great ease. For in the passage, which the people made that followed <hi>Mustaffa,</hi> the grauel of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the riuer being raised and remoued by the heauy hooues of the cattell, was driuen downe along the saide water to a place, where by great good hap there was also a Foorde, and there gathering it selfe together in a heape, had in such sort raised the depth of the channell, that it made as it were a shelfe for their commodious passage, so <note place="margin">A meruelous kind of Foord.</note> that the remnant of the people, carriages, and artilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry passing ouer the same, there was not so much as one man that perished. And in this manner did the Turkish people passe ouer <hi>Canac,</hi> and vpon the bankes thereof did they rest themselues that day, and the next, and there made stay till the whole army was mustred and set in order. From thence remouing themselues all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not hauing any meanes at all to fynde victuailes ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for themselues or for their beastes, they encamped the day following in certaine barren champaines, where there was neyther corne nor cattell, neyther could they learne that in those quarters there were any villages at all. By meanes whereof the hunger of their beasts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing greatly, (a thing affirmed by dyuers faithfull &amp; <note place="margin">The calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Turkish hoast,</note> credible souldiers that were present in those calamities) they were constrained to geue to their horses and mules the leaues and stalkes of verie drie and withered reedes, &amp; such other like thinges of no sustenaunce at all. And the men themselues were faine to satisfy their hunger with those vttermost reliques, that they went vp and downe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:23114:58"/>
piking &amp; gathering out of those poore victuailles, which now by corruption were abhominable to mans nature. There was not a man in the whole army, but perceaued that it was high tyme to rid himselfe of these inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: howbeit to returne backward was odious to them all, in respect of the present famine, and to go on forward was more terrible vnto them, in respect of the great feare that they had, to continue some longer tyme in these commenced miseries. Notwithstanding needes must they follow the fortune of their captaines: among whom <hi>Mustaffa</hi> the next morning, before all the rest, set himselfe forward on his determined iourney. Hee had not long marched onward, but there was discouered good store of sundry plantes, &amp; neere vnto them a very large plaine all greene and flourishing, &amp; garnished with many trees: by the onely sight whereof euery man was refreshed for the hope of good harbour, and hastened their paces som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then ordinary, vntill they were entred into those champaines, being abundantly fertile in all kind of corne and fruites, that could be desyred of hungry man and horse.

The Widdow, although her mynd was herewithall sore troubled &amp; perplexed, yet outwardly in her countenance shewed her selfe to be pleased, and seemed curteously to yeeld, what she was of necessity constrained to grant: as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well because <hi>Mustaffa</hi> had one of her sonnes already in <note place="margin">The Widdow leaueth both her sonnes in Mustaffaes handes.</note> possession, as also for that her selfe &amp; her whole state were now in his power, &amp; as it were at his deuotion: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leauing both her sonnes behind her, she returned to her Castell.</p>

And so hauing passed vnder <hi>Sumaohia,</hi> (not far from which place he had put to the sworde som fewe victuailers of <hi>Osmans,</hi> that more boldly then wisely had issued out of the citty,) and being with all his people encamped in certaine freshe fieldes, a little on this syde of the said <hi>Sumachia:</hi> I knowe not how, but he was so well fauoured by good fortune, <note place="margin">The spyes or messengers of the Tartan ans taken by the encamped Persians.</note> that he surprysed certaine spies or messengers, sent from <hi>Abdilcherai,</hi> who first went to carry the news to <hi>Osman,</hi> of the arriuall of the Tartarian Captaine, and according to the order taken betweene them, to knowe his pleasure, what should be put in execution.

The Barbarian captaine longed to see the time that he might staine his dartes and sworde in the blood of his enemies entrailes, and to charge himselfe with the expected pray: and therefore presently departed, and with poasting iourneyes passed ouer <hi>Canac,</hi> where <hi>Ares-Chan</hi> was as yet encamped, and assaulting him in furious <note place="margin">All the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an army of Ares-Chan discomfited by the Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians &amp; Ares-Chan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hanged.</note> manner, (without allowing him any time of defence,) lyke a rauening and deuouring flame, discomfited all his hoast, and taking him aliue, sent him to <hi>Sumachia</hi> to the garrisons of <hi>Osman,</hi> who forthwith caused him to bee hanged by the necke out of a lodging in the same <hi>Diuano</hi> or Councell house, where he had heretofore sitten as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour.</p>
            <p>From thence, wading ouer the riuer, and coursing a little aboue <hi>Genge,</hi> he found <hi>Emanguli-Chan,</hi> among cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vallies, with his wife, all his familie and a great parte of the nobilitie of <hi>Genge,</hi> hunting the wild-boare, &amp; sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly put him to flight, tooke from him his wife, all the Ladies, and many slaues, and slew many of the rest, that vnawares were brought thither to see such disport.

left no maner of inhumanitie or crueltie vnattempted, but satisfied all their most immoderate and barbarous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that naturall fiercenesse, or present occasion could minister vnto them. And so beeing loaden with spoyles, satiated with bloud, and weary with the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their enimies, they returned merrily towardes <hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uan,</hi> and passing againe ouer <hi>Canac,</hi> they came on the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of <hi>Eres</hi> into certaine low champaines, enuironed about with hilles, and there hauing pitched their tentes, <note place="margin">The Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in certaine fieldes on the hether side of Canac, fall to sleepe.</note> without any feare they setled themselues to sleepe, and with rest to repaire their fore-wearied sences.</p>

in the Persian Prince by this good successe, and therefore leauing his mother in <hi>Eres,</hi> he followed on his iourney towardes <hi>Sumachia:</hi> but in passing by the way where the <note place="margin">Begum left at Eres.</note> Tartarians were encamped, and in descending the hilles, that enuironed the plaine, he discouered their tentes that were there pitched: whereupon he stood in great doubt <note place="margin">The Persian prince disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians.</note> what to attempt, whether by venturing vppon so popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous an hoast to proue the perrill of battaile, or yeelding to so great a danger to returne back into <hi>Persia.</hi> Too great a shame he thought it to returne, &amp; rather then he would with ignominie refuse so good an occasion offred him, he did choose with honour to endaunger himselfe to the most manifest perrill of his lyfe: and therefore descending the hill, and drawing nigh to the pauilions of the enemy, he perceaued that all the army was laid downe, enioying their quiet rest and sleep, and their horses, some couched &amp; some standing, but all of them void of saddles or horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Whereupon without any stay, setting spurres to his horse he pricked forward with all his hoast, and in all hast and terrible manner ran to assault the Tartarians, who were now both buried in their spoiles &amp; sleep: &amp; hauing slaine their first watch, and their second, although with some losse, among the tumultuary souldiers hee made an vniuersall confusion, &amp; common slaughter, putting some <note place="margin">The Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans destroyed &amp; Abdilche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rai taken aliue by the Persian Prince.</note> to flight, killing others, and taking diuers of them Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues. Among whome was their Captaine <hi>Abdilcherai,</hi> who was taken aliue and sent to the king in <hi>Casbin,</hi> vnder good and sure custodie.</p>
            <p>After these victories, the Persian Prince scoured to <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machia,</hi> and compassed the Cittie round-about, wherein <note place="margin">The Persian Prince vnder Sumachia threateneth Osman.</note> the new Turkish Captaine <hi>Osman</hi> sate as Gouernour, to the great reproach of Persia: and there encamping him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:23114:67"/>
sent word to <hi>Osman,</hi> that if he would yeeld himselfe, he would let him goe with his life and goods: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise if he would stand-out obstinate, and not yeeld vp the cittie, which vniustly he possessed, he should be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to surrender it by force, and his life withall. <hi>Osman,</hi> that knew nothing of the Tartarians ouerthrow, but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that entertaining his enimies with faire wordes and goodly promises, the Tartarians might in the meane space returne, and hew them all to peeces, gaue the sayd Prince a most courteous aunsweare, saying that hee was <note place="margin">Osman an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth the threates of the Prince.</note> very ready to yeeld vp the Cittie, but withall entreated him that he would make stay but for three onely dayes, &amp; graunt him time to put all his thinges in readinesse, that so he might freely depart, as it pleased the prince in courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy to offer him. The Persian Prince was very glad to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue such an aunsweare, &amp; well knowing the ouerthrow which he gaue to the enimy, did verily perswade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that <hi>Osman</hi> frankly, and with a true &amp; constant mind had made this promise: &amp; therefore expected that what the Turke had offred should be performed. But <hi>Osman</hi> not meaning to commit himselfe to the faith of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, though hee was vtterly resolued to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into some stronger place, yet was he very curious to find meanes to escape into those safer refuges, and not to come within the fingers of the prince. And therefore somwhat before the assigned terme of the three daies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, seeing that the Tartarians whom he looked for, did not appeare, he resolued to saue himselfe by secreat flight: because he was sure, that if hee should remaine in <hi>Sumachia,</hi> hee had good reason to feare the inhabitantes themselues would betray him, and that if he should yeeld himselfe to the Prince, he might be by him also easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:23114:68"/>
And thereupon determined with himselfe, by the help of the darke night, and a difficult way, (though <note place="margin">Osman deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth to slie se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And so he iourneyed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the said mountaines with great secrecie and silence, leading away with him whatsoeuer either in the tyme of peace or of war he hadlaid vp in store, and without any daunger or threate of the enemy he escaped safely to the <note place="margin">Osman fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machia, seapeth to Demircapi.</note> said Citty of <hi>Derbent.</hi> On the morning the inhabitants of <hi>Sumachia,</hi> without any stay opened the gates of the citty to the Persian Duke, who seeing their infidelity, that they were not onely ready to giue entertainement to <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> but also to help him to escape without giuing to the prince any inckling of his departure, did put in execution the effectes of his wrath and indignation which euen in <hi>Casbin</hi> he had conceaued in his minde against them: and <note place="margin">

                  <p>The Persian Prince delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth whether he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home or go forward to Derbent.</p>
               </note> with great cruelty did punish the miserable and infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Commons of the Citty, making their houses euen with the ground, destroying both the old and new walls therof, and bringing the whole lande to nought, that sometime was so desired a receit of the Turkes. But when he should depart from thence, he was in a great deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with himselfe whether he should passe on to <hi>Derbent,</hi> or returne into <hi>Persia.</hi> The citty well fenced, the cold time of winter, and the long voiage that hee should haue had homeward, persuaded the Prince to lay aside the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise of <hi>Demircapi,</hi> and so he made choise to returne to <hi>Casbin.</hi> But first for all that, he determined to make his retyre by the people of <hi>Eres</hi> and of <hi>Sechi,</hi> and vpon them <note place="margin">The people of Sechi &amp; Eres punnished.</note> as vpon rebelles to inflict deserued punnishment. For
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:23114:68"/>
the effecting of which his purpose, he made his present repaire thither, and spared neither sexe, norage, nor any condition, but though the persons were vnequall, yet was the punishment equall to all. And after the execution of this his reuenge and indignation, he with his foresaide mother <hi>Begum,</hi> and with his armie, though somewhat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished and endamaged, yet victorious and triumphant turned home to <hi>Casbin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Young <hi>Abdilcherai</hi> the Tartarian, was kept within the kinges <hi>Serraglio</hi> in good &amp; safe lodgings, neither did <note place="margin">Abdilcherai prisoner in Casbin well entertained.</note> he in this his captiuitie find want of any thing, but agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to his calling he was appointed a very tolerable and easie imprisonment: which day by day was in such sort enlarged, that he seemed to liue not as a prisoner or cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, but rather as a companion of those of the court, and as it were in apparant liberty: by which occasion, hauing insinuated himselfe into the loue of <hi>Begum</hi> the kings wife, <note place="margin">Abdilcherai the prisoner enamored, &amp; beloued of Queene Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum.</note> he spent his time in courting of her, and she again in cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him in all secreat and couert manner. These mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall affections proceeded in such sorte, and these inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungeable fauours discouered themselues so openly, that in the <hi>Serraglio</hi> and ouer all the Citty, there was a rife report, how shameles <hi>Begum</hi> had participated her bed &amp; <note place="margin">The report of the loose life of Begum the Persian kings wife.</note> herselie with the Tartarian prisoner. Howbeit neither the king nor the prince knew any thing of it: but the king perceauing that the yong gentleman was generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to be valiant and curteous, began to thinke of a matter, which might easily fall out to bee a very great commodity and help to himselfe. For the king fauouring these good qualities, being conioined with proportion of <note place="margin">The deep consideration of Mahamet the Persian King.</note> body and nobility of birth, (because he noysed himselfe to be the brother of <hi>Tatar-Chan)</hi> persuaded himselfe veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:23114:69"/>
that it could not but proue a meruellous benefite to him, if in steed of a captiue he should make him his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and giue him his daughter to wife. Whereby (hee was in good hope) there might grow such an amity and vnion between the Tartarian Precopenses, &amp; himselfe, as they would not onely refuse from thenceforth to fauour <hi>Amurath</hi> in these warres, but also that they would bee enemyes vnto him, and in the fauour of <hi>Persia</hi> turne their armes &amp; affections against him. Very considerate assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was this cogitation of the king: but yet did it greatly <note place="margin">The Kinges purpose doth not please the Sultans of Casbin.</note> displease the Sultans of <hi>Casbin:</hi> who either because some of them was a suiter to the said daughter, or because they did naturally hate the Tartarian Nation, or els because they had a mischeeuous conceit of the loues of <hi>Begum,</hi> did all their endeauours to turne the king from so strange a purpose, and vsed all the arte that possible they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, to cancell out of his mind that detestable opinion, as they thought. Howbeit they could nothing preuaile either with their eloquence or other their cunning deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: but the king was now vpon the point to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the marriage, when as the Sultans entring into the <hi>Serraglio</hi> with a company of their people, and finding <note place="margin">Abdilcherai slaine in the Serraglio of Casbin, by the Sultans.</note> there the vnfortunate Tartarian, ran him through the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, cutting of first his priuie members, and flapping them vpon his mouth after a most barbarous and filthy maner. It is reported that Queene <hi>Begum</hi> likewise was then also murdered by them, but (how soeuer it came to passe) it is a cleere case, that the death of the Tartarian Duke was procured in the maner aboue mentioned, and that the poore lady neuer after that day, saw the light of the sonne. Which whether it was put in execution by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her husband, who had beene aduertised of all
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:23114:69"/>
thinges that had happened, or that the Sultanes wrought it for the publike interest: they know best, that haue had the meanes to insinuate themselues into the innermost places of the Realme: For vnto our knowledge neuer came there any other report touching the particulars thereof.</p>
            <p>Vpon the death of this Tartarian there sprung-vp ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Vpon these murders there arose many calamities in Persia.</note> ciuill dissentions in Persia, and so therevpon followed also the banishment of some, the flight of others, and son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry miseries, that lighted vppon many. And the great hopes whereby the king was mooued to desire the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, were chaunged into most turbulent and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some passions, and daungerous calamities, that threatned the vtter confusion of the Persian affaires, to the singular benefit &amp; commodity of <hi>Amurath.</hi> And yet for all these strange accidents, the king ceassed not to prepare new for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the next yeare, and as much as in him lay to quiet all tumultuous disorders, brideling his owne priuate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and the motions of his sonne <hi>Emirhamze Mirize,</hi> and procuring at last a perfect vnitie, which hee thought most necessary to continue the defence of his kingdome. And these were the stirs that happened in the Persian and Tartarian affaires the first yeare, being the yeare of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, 1578.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Osman Bassa</hi> being in <hi>Demir-Capi,</hi> after the returne of the Persian Prince to <hi>Casbin,</hi> continually employed himselfe in laying platfourmes for the enlarging of the conquestes already begon, and for the assuring of those places vnder the gouernement of <hi>Amurath.</hi> Among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasions, that he tooke for the better establishing of his owne matters, one was the friendship that he entred with <hi>Sahamal,</hi> Lord of the mountaine of <hi>Brus,</hi> of whome
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:23114:70"/>
I haue more then once made mention before. With this man did <hi>Osman</hi> practise many tokens of good will, and he againe interchangeably towards <hi>Osman,</hi> wherevpon there <note place="margin">Osman practiseth frendship with Sahamal the Georgian.</note> arose a faithfull frendship betwene them, if not thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inwardly, yet at the least in outward apparance: wherevnto in short time there was added a straight knot of alliance, for that <hi>Osman</hi> tooke to wife a daughter of the sayd <hi>Sahamal,</hi> and hauing celebrated the marriage, hee <note place="margin">Osman mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Saha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</note> thought he was sure of all sides, &amp; could not desire grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter signes of the sinceritie of his loue. But soone after, grounding himselfe vpon reasonable coniectures, he toke a suspicion that <hi>Sahamal,</hi> for all his inward and outward practises of frendship towards him, might notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding receiue some secrete order from the Persian king to betray him, and to deliuer the Cittie from the Turkish oppression, and so reduce all the Prouince, as before it was, to his auncient deuotion. Among other occasions, whereby <hi>Osman</hi> was moued and induced to suspect it, (al being of great force and importance,) the speeches of his wife (being <hi>Sahamals</hi> daughter) gaue him greatest cause. For she being rauished with the valour, riches, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie of her husband, would not conceale any thing from him, that she knew was deuised against his life, but freely vttered by word of mouth vnto him, that her father hauing reconciled himselfe to the Persian king, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his confederacy and frendship with him, and that letters went betwene them of great matters, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the affaires of <hi>Siruan.</hi> By this discouery <hi>Osman Bassa</hi> grew into a great suspicion, that <hi>Sahamal</hi> should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully practise his death, and perswaded himselfe veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the frendship, the mutuall offices of loue betwene them, and the marriage that was made, were wholy dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:23114:70"/>
to that end. This aduertisement <hi>Osman</hi> kept secreat to himselfe, and made shew to his wife that hee kept no such reckoning of it, as in deede he did, &amp; ought to doo, being a matter of so great importance: But yet in his hart resolued to keep it in store to his benefite: in such sorte, that not onely the deuise which <hi>Sahamal</hi> had imagined against him was quite frustrated and auoyded, but also <hi>Sahamal</hi> himselfe was punnished with deserued death. And therefore <hi>Osman</hi> caused <hi>Sahamal</hi> to come to him, &amp; thereby feasting him, courting him, &amp; entertaining him, as it became him to vse his beloued father in lawe, and by many other apparant and confident behauiours, he made <hi>Sahamal</hi> strongly presume, that he might take oportunity to put in execution those designementes, for effecting whereof he had thus procured the frendship and alliance of <hi>Osman.</hi> But <hi>Osman</hi> preuented the intent of <hi>Sahamal.</hi> For hauing inuited him (according to the custome) to come and celebrate with him certain of their solemne feastes, he made the most valorous and trustie of his esquadrons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his determination, and enioyned them, that assoone as <hi>Sahamal</hi> was entred into his court, euen in the very dismounting from his horse, they should all fall vpon him, cut of his head, and put all his retinue to <note place="margin">

               </note> the edge of the sword. Old <hi>Sahamal</hi> failed not to come accordingly, being inuited by his son in-law and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the solemne feastes, &amp; in his lighting from his horse all was performed that <hi>Osman</hi> had commanded: &amp; forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with there were dispatched two thousand horsemen to spoile &amp; sacke all the lands, &amp; country of the said <hi>Georgian</hi> Lord, to the great maruell &amp; astonishment both of farre &amp; neere. The newes thereof came to <hi>Casbin,</hi> euen to the kinges eares, who tooke the matter very greeuously, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:23114:71"/>
beganne to foresee, that the conquering of that countrey would proue very difficult, and so feared greatly that the Prouince of <hi>Siruan</hi> would remaine still in the Turkes handes. And this was the end of the stirres in <hi>Siruan</hi> the first yeare: &amp; so the winter comming-on very sharpely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man ceased from battell and forraging, forsaking the forrestes and the fieldes, and attended wholly to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of such things, as they had already conquered.</p>
            <p>And now by this time all these aduertisementes were arriued at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> &amp; <hi>Amurath</hi> had receaued all the particular intelligences of all thinges that had happened.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ssoone as <hi>Amurath</hi> was certifyed by the letters of <hi>Mustaffa,</hi> of all that which had happened since his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, vntill his returne to <hi>Erzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and vnderstoode the battelles that followed, the obedience that was yeelded by the Georgianj, the conquering of citties, the building of new Fortes, and to bee short so good a beginning of so desired an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise. Of these prosperouse successes, which by <hi>Mustaffa</hi> were described to bee far greater then in'deed they were, (hauing geuen order, that <hi>Alessandro</hi> &amp; <hi>Manucchiar,</hi> who <note place="margin">The conside rations of Amurath.</note> were sent vnto him by <hi>Mustaffa,</hi> should bee safely kept with all good entertainment,) he began to cast many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises in his head touching such matters, as were to bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the next yeare. And especially there arose at one instant many &amp; sundry considerations in his mind, which told him that the manner of sending his army to a newe resting place might be altered diuers waies, &amp; so amiddest so many doubtes he remayned in a mammering what to doo. On the one side hee was of opinion, that it must needes be necessary to passe againe into <hi>Siruan,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer those Citties that were first conquered by <hi>Mustaffa,</hi> and after subdued againe by the Persians. For by that meanes it would come to passe, that the countrey of <hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uan</hi> should remaine quietly vnder the gouernement of <hi>Amurath,</hi> and so the great trauells, the troublesome voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the harde conquestes, the bloud already spilled, the dangerous perrilles, &amp; the losses of the next yeare should
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:23114:73"/>
not altogether be frustrate. But this opinion of his, hee himselfe (euen of himselfe) chaunged, as it is reported, for the great hope that he had in the aide that was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him by <hi>Tatar-Chan,</hi> who did faithfully assure both him and <hi>Osman,</hi> that he would ouerrunne that region a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, and set forwarde those notable designementes that he had intended, and gaue his word to doo great matters in his seruice. In respect of this hope (which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fell-out to be but vaine, through the default of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-Chan,</hi> as in place it shalbe shewed) hee laide <hi>Siruan</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syde, and committed the defence thereof to the false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Tartarian, &amp; to the valour of <hi>Osman:</hi> consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with himselfe, whether it were not expedient to send his army in a straite course to <hi>Tauris,</hi> &amp; to find meanes that there might be erected in that Citty a Fortresse, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well fenced with artillary and arcubuse, and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the vertue of valourous souldiers, should neuer be subdued by the power of <hi>Persia.</hi> And so bringing this his purpose to effecte, without the other difficulties, (which if the warre should fall out to bee long, hee must needes endure) there might remaine in his possession all the cuntrey that lyeth betweene <hi>Tauris</hi> and <hi>Erzirum.</hi> The easinesse and speed, wherewith this his purpose might be brought to effect, did fauour his conceit in this pointe wonderfully: for there was no man but thought that the Forte might be built in very few daies, &amp; euery man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him that it was an easy matter for so great an hoast not onely to pierce into <hi>Tauris,</hi> but also to passe whether soeuer hee would desire. This his designement was of great weight &amp; importance, neither did there want some that priuily and familiarly did aduise him, that it was to be preferred before the rest, and comforted the king to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:23114:73"/>
goe forward withall, by promising prosperous successe therein.</p>
            <p>But albeit that <hi>Amurath</hi> had his minde enkindled with ambitious desires and lustes, burning after glorie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pricked on with sharpe spurres of Auarice, longed to carrie away the victorie ouer his enemies landes: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, laying aside all his foresaid consultations, as being too eager and importunate, and weighing his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires in a more vpright ballance, he deemed it better to preferre the safetie of his Armie, the honor of this warre, and the certaintie of victorie, before the doubtfull speed in attempting the enterprise: and in the end he did reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely conclude with himself, that he had rather (though but slowly) ouercome &amp; triumph ouer his enemies, then (too soone with shame) to forsake and abandon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signements begun: and therefore did fully determine first to assure and strengthen his owne borders, to lay open the wayes that were shut against him with woods &amp; bushes, to confirme his conquests that were as yet but doubtfull, to discouer all secret and treacherous ambushments, and to make the voiage plaine and open: rather then to runne headlong with vncertain conceits into another mans cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and to conquer places, that were farre of, fenced and defended not onely by mightie enemies, but also by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it selfe. In this his resolution he was confirmed by the state of the <hi>Georgiani,</hi> whom he perceaued as yet not to be reduced to such assured obedience, as he durst alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether trust them: and in particular he feared the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of <hi>Daut,</hi> and more then that, the comming of <hi>Simon.</hi> For by these occasions it might fall out, that his Armie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Tauris,</hi> might be assailed on the one side by the <hi>Georgiani,</hi> and on the other side by the <hi>Persians,</hi> and so
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:23114:74"/>
brought into verie great miseries. And this misfortune might happen vnto him, as often as he should haue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to send new supplies to the Fortresse.</p>
            <p>By these deliberations, and with this resolution <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> being moued, he did absolutely signifie to <hi>Mustaffa</hi> by writing, that it was his pleasure, that against the next spring he should prepare all such prouision, as he thought necessarie for the buylding of certayn Fortes in the waies that lead from <hi>Erzirum</hi> into <hi>Georgia,</hi> to the end, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made all those wayes safe and secure, and brought that people into due obedience, the next yeare he might employ his courage to more noble and haughtie enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises. Hereupon <hi>Mustaffa</hi> presently directed out his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to the Cities of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> of <hi>Damasco,</hi> of <hi>Caraemit,</hi> and <note place="margin">Mustaffa sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth outcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement for a new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> to all the other places of <hi>Soria</hi> and <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> that they should take-vp cunning workmasters, Pioners, and other such persons, to the number of twentie thousand: And likewise wrote to all the Countries specified in the first Booke, that all their Souldiers, (yea, and in greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then they were the last yeare) should be in a readinesse the next Spring, to returne to the warre: Whereof he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the rumour to be spread euen as farre as <hi>Egypt.</hi> He commaunded likewise, that they should make collection of the Taxes and Tenthes, and that in greater quantitie, then it was the yeare before: and made such prouision of Money from the <hi>Chambres</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and other places, as he thought necessarie for these purposes.</p>

done vnto him, to whom by the course of his age the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of his kingdom belonged, or rather who alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die was put in possession thereof by his Mother: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, was in a great hope, that some means should be deuised how he myght be established &amp; confirmed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in after a more sure and safe maner, and that <hi>Manucchiar,</hi> his brother, should be honoured with some other Office worthy the magnificence of <hi>Amurath.</hi> Wherein although he had some litle kind of doubt that troubled him: yet did he euer carie a constant resolution, that he would not in any case chaunge his Religion, nor staine hys conscience wyth so fowle and infamous a blot. On the other side, <hi>Manucchiar</hi> the yonger Brother, who the last yeare had followed the <hi>Campe</hi> of <hi>Mustaffa,</hi> and had shewed some good tokens of manhood, with an expresse kind of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie vertue, that he might the rather enter into the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of his Mothers State, induced therunto by the flattering desire of Rule, was vtterly resolued with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to do any thing, so that he might not liue as a priuate souldier, but rather to take from his brother his birthright and enheritance, and with the vtter losse of his countrie-Religion wherein he was borne, to purchase a vyle and base kingdome, yea, and rather then he would liue infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in dignitie to his brother, he would make himselfe the slaue of <hi>Amurath,</hi> and the Deuill.

The <hi>Turkish</hi> king willed <hi>Manucchiar</hi> therein to do as he himselfe thought good. For that for his owne part, he did greatlie feare, least <hi>Alessandro</hi> by some treacherie myght depriue him of his lyfe; and so succeeding in his former place, might make that State more rebellious then euer it was before. Howbeit, for somuch as <hi>Manucchiar</hi> consented vnto it, he was also to content himselfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and to commit the custodie of that State to such care, as <hi>Manucchiar</hi> should take for the preseruation of himselfe.

But in <hi>Prrsia,</hi> in the pallace of <hi>Casbin,</hi> many consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were had in this meane time.

               <note place="margin">The offer of Emanguli-Chan.</note> that he should bind himselfe vpon paine of his head, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>Siruan,</hi> and not suffer <hi>Osman</hi> to attempt any newe buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings or further conquestes in that Region: and therein wrought so much with the King, that his request was not denyed him. Whereuppon the charge of the gouernment of <hi>Genge,</hi> &amp; guarding the Prouince of <hi>Siruan</hi> from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Osman,</hi> was frankly committed vnto him. Neither were his offers extended any further: For the Persian King knew wel ynough, that if the Tartarians or the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Mustaffa</hi> should come thither, hee should stand in need of greater prouision and stronger defences. And therefore he gaue order to <hi>Emir-Chan,</hi> gouernour of <hi>Tauris,</hi> to <hi>Toco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac</hi> Gouernour of <hi>Reiuan,</hi> to <hi>Serap-Chan</hi> gouernor of <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuan,</hi> and to diuers other Captaines that were neerest, that at euery instance and request of <hi>Emanguli-Chan,</hi> they should be ready (if need so required) with their power to resist ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Tartarians or the Turkes, when they should enter into the countrey of <hi>Siruan.</hi> Neither did <hi>Emanguli</hi> forget to <note place="margin">Emanguli in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viteth the son of Sahamal the Georgian to ioinc with him.</note> solicit the sonne of <hi>Sahamal,</hi> who succeeded in the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Brus,</hi> that he would ioyne himselfe with him, and they two together woulde take occasion to reuenge the

grieuous losses that they had receiued of the Turkish army, and especially to chastise <hi>Osman Bassa,</hi> as hee deserued for the death of <hi>Sahamal</hi> his father. Howbeit the saide sonne would not by any meanes endaunger himselfe, neither durst in any wise shewe himselfe an open enemie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor of the Turkes, but was content to beare the losse of his father in such sort, as he thought most behoouefull for the preseruation of his owne estate,</p>
            <p>And this was the prouision that was made for the securitie of that Prouince, concerning which, euerie man almost was of opinion, that <hi>Mustaffa</hi> should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thither againe, but they knew well that hee shoulde chieflie be employed about the strengthening and assuring of the conquestes of <hi>Georgia:</hi> and therefore there was no further prouision made there. But the King turned all his <note place="margin">The Persian king min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to send men towards Teflis in Georgia.</note> counsels and cogitations to send people towards <hi>Teflis,</hi> for he knew of a certentie, that either all the Turkish Armie or els some great bande of it shoulde come to bring suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours thither, or els it must needes come to passe, that the Fort should fall againe into the hands of the <hi>Georgiani.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter was the King verie busie and intentiue, when as <hi>Simon</hi> the Georgian, who was sometimes impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned <note place="margin">Simon the Georgian.</note> at <hi>Cahaca</hi> (of whome we made mention before) and being throughlie enformed of all thinges that had happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, thought with himselfe that hereby he might take op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie to obtaine at the Kinges hand such helpe as hee had long desired, and purchase those honours that he had long expected, For hee deemed it a verie likelie and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable matter, for the King to desire and wish with all his heart, that hee (carrying the name of a famous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, &amp; throughly acquainted with al the aduantages, that might be taken in <hi>Georgia,</hi> to the great losse and anoyance

of the Turks) would offer himself to go into that prouince and there gathering his souldiers together with a soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne authoritie ouer all that people, to defend those cities that were yet vntouched, far better than his brother <hi>Dant</hi> could doe, and in another maner a sort (than he also could) to trouble and offend the Turks, which must needes come that way to succour <hi>Teflis.</hi> Neither did hee protract the time long, after he was entred into this cogitation, but with conuenient speed dispatched his supplication to the King, <note place="margin">Simon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a request to the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King.</note> wherin he declared his request, &amp; reproouing his brother for his cowardise &amp; flight, promised to perfourme greate matters himselfe.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Simon</hi> in the time that he remained prisoner at <hi>Caha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity between Ismahel and Simon.</note> entred strait familiarity with <hi>Ismahel</hi> (late son to King <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> deceased) who, as we told you before, was sent thither by his father to be safelie kept: &amp; in this mutual familiarity there passed such enterchangeble offices of loue betweene them, that as <hi>Ismahel</hi> shewed himselfe louing and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the conditions of <hi>Simon,</hi> so much did <hi>Simon</hi> for his part shew himself dutiful &amp; deuoted to the vertues &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity of <hi>Ismahel:</hi> wherby there arose an extraordinary loue of the one towards the other: which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in such sort, that <hi>Simon</hi> (I know not by what sophistry deluded or by what flattery enticed) was perswaded by the Persian prince to forsake his religion, and to follow that barbarous <note place="margin">Simon indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to change his religion, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why.</note> superstition. What might be the reasons that were able to change the mind of <hi>Simon,</hi> being before so constant, and so wel instructed in the Greek-Christian faith (for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining wherof he had chosen to liue depriued of his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and estate.) it can not bee so precisely declared: but it seemeth, there were three principall and powerfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectes, that wrought this vnexpected noueltie in him
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:23114:77"/>
Namely, the perpetuall imprisonment, which he knew hee could not auoyd, as long as he continued of that mind: the friendship of <hi>Ismahel</hi> (friendship I say, that oftentimes chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth mens natures, much more their opinions:) and thirdly the great honours that Prince <hi>Ismahel</hi> did dayly promise him, whensoeuer it should happen that hee were named <note place="margin">The powe of friendship.</note> King. While they were thus mutually affected one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, it happened that King <hi>Tamas</hi> died, and <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahel</hi> being accompanied from <hi>Cahaca</hi> to <hi>Casbin,</hi> was with meruellous pompe saluted King of all his father domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Among all the rest, whome the King full dearely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, hee could not forget, but preserue in memorie the vertue and fame of <hi>Simon,</hi> who was already according to the Kings pleasure circumcised, and made a Mahometan, yea, and in such sort did he remember him, that hee was most desirous to bestowe greater honours and rewardes vpon him than he himselfe could request. But sudden and vnexpected death lighting vpon, before he was aware of it was the occasion why <hi>Simon</hi> remained without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement, and yet so greatlie contented, as his recouered <note place="margin">The diuers cogitations of Simon.</note> libertie could breed contentment in him. Notwithstanding among the many varieties of his thoughts did <hi>Simon</hi> long time wander, being after the death of <hi>Ismahel</hi> shreudlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted in his mind, coursing and discoursing with himself whether it were better for him, either to remaine still in <hi>Casbin</hi> and to stay the comming of the new King, or els to resolue vpon departure, and so to returne to his forsaken faith, and wasted Citties. But in the end, after many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations, hee concluded that it should bee more safe and commendable, considering the state of his affaires, to stay for the new King, and vnder his protection and fauour to find some means, that he might berestored to the dignity
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:23114:77"/>
and rule that was vsurped vpon him, rather than to flie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way alone, and (hauing no stay to leane vppon) to seeke for quarrels and contentions with his brother, yea and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture to purchase himselfe a bitter death. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did willingly maintaine himselfe in <hi>Casbin,</hi> looking and hoping, that the chaunge of his schisme (for so it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be accounted than a religion) his imprisonment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, his libertie recouered, his fame of great valour, his present necessitie, his deuotion and obedience to the king manifestlie declared, should deserue at the new kings hands some honour and reward, or at least, if it would please him to commit any charge of the warre in <hi>Georgia</hi> to his care, a constant and assured protection of him. And therefore when <hi>Mahamet</hi> was now established in his kingdome, and was certified of the losse of <hi>Teflis, Simon</hi> besought him of lawfull leaue, to returne vnder his protection into his own ill-defended countrey, offering himselfe withall to venture vpon any perill or trauell whatsoeuer, and promising that he would neuer either feare any great enterprise, or auoyd any base exployt, so that he might know he might do good seruice to <hi>Mahamet.</hi> With great satisfaction did the King consent to the requests of <hi>Simon,</hi> and named him the Chan <note place="margin">Simon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (by the Persian king) the Chan of all his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> of all that kingdome, which hee possessed before by the name of a Christian: and with all diligence was he sent with <hi>Alicul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And forasmuch as here they must rest, &amp; put themselues in defence, by fortifying with walles, &amp; compassing with ditches the ruinated City of <hi>Chars,</hi> which must be done in the best maner that might be, and with as great speed as was possible, ther was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remedie, but besides the Pioners and Engyners (that were brought for that purpose) there must be set to worke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Spaoglani,</hi> many slaues, and some Ianizzaries also. But it was not presently put in execution, as the necessity requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:23114:79"/>
inconueniences happened in the Armie, while they were busie about this worke, and namelie vpon the xxv. day of August, when they had almost euen finished the whole building, the souldiers endured a most sudden colde, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of much snowe that then fell in greate aboundance. But so vehement it was not, that it coulde not bee borne, <note place="margin">Snowes at Chars in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust.</note> but euery man was the rather forwarde to execute anie commandement, that according to the pleasure of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> should bee enioyned them by <hi>Mustaffa,</hi> all of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generallie of opinion, that the only repairing and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Chars</hi> was but a small matter, in regard of so greate an Armie gathered together with so greate diligence, no doubt for some greater and further purpose.</p>
            <p>For the accomplishing of this fortification nowe there remained nothing to doe, it being fullie finished, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nowe it was time to attempt some newe enterprises: Whereupon the Generall resolued to sende succours into <hi>Georgia</hi> to the fort of <hi>Teflis,</hi> without which it was most certaine that the Fortresse would be yeelded to the Georgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For this purpose he must needs take one of these cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, either to choose some valiant Captaine that should go <note place="margin">The consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staffa touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Teflis.</note> thither, or els to go himselfe in person, with all his Armie, about so great an enterprise as that was. In which cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he remayned very doubtfull, casting in his mind on the one side a certaine feare, that if he went not with all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, some mishappe might light vpon the Captaine that should goe in his steed, and on the other side bethinking himselfe, that if he shoulde goe thither with all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he should hardlie satisfie <hi>Amurah,</hi> whom he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made to beleeue, that he had sudued all the Georgians and reduced all that prouince to his obedience and deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Notwithstanding in this his ambiguity, the desire that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:23114:79"/>
he had to preserue his credit with <hi>Amurath,</hi> preuailed, and hee thought that it would be as sufficient to sende succours thither by a Captaine accompanied with twentie thousand chosen souldiers, as to go himself with all his campe: being of opinion, that in the straites of <hi>Tomanis</hi> and other places, so huge a multitude might giue occasion to their enemies rather of praye than of feare, and might breed to their own forces rather lettes and impedimentes, than any fauour or help. Wherein hee was highly commended of all men, though therby with the King in particular he lost his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, to whom he had heretofore made so goodly promises, that he wel hoped, without sending any such preparation thither, to haue receiued of that people much greater obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>Now forasmuch as it was verie needful to fortifie and <note place="margin">Hassan Bassa of Damasco, chosen Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for the succouring of Teflis, with 20000. soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> strengthen that place, he made choise of <hi>Hassan</hi> the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Damasco,</hi> son to that <hi>Mahamet</hi> that was the principal Visior of the Court, as famous as any that euer had any gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, a man no lesse faire in face &amp; countenance, than valourous and venturous in sudden and important cases, and to him he deliuered between eighteen and twenty thousand souldiers, some of <hi>Greece,</hi> some of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masco,</hi> and some of <hi>Caraemit:</hi> ioyning in company with him one <hi>Resuan-Bassa,</hi> Captaine of certaine Aduenturers (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended <note place="margin">Resuan Bassa Captain of certain Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturers.</note> in the forsaid number) that voluntarily offered themselues to follow the forces of <hi>Hassan:</hi> and assigned vnto him likewise fourty thousand Duckets, and many loades of Meale, Rise, and Barley, with other thinges necessarie both <note place="margin">40000. Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kats caried to Teflis.</note> for diet, and for warre: and so set him forward for <hi>Teflis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Hassan</hi> caried a haughtie mind, with high thoughts agreeable to his magnanimity, and did determine with him selfe to loose all that he had, yea, and his veric life withall,

rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shuld not bring these succors within the wals of <hi>Teflis.</hi> But when he was now come to the famous strait of <hi>Tomanis,</hi> &amp; passed the ruins of other treacherous places, he arriued at a dangerous passage (without perceiuing any footing of an enemy) wher the woods on the one side, deep valleyes &amp; craggy rocks on the other side, wold make any man astonied that shuld come thither: and, behold, euen on a sudden, the Persiaus, togither with the Georgians, vnder the conduct of <hi>Aliculi-Chan</hi> &amp; of <hi>Simon,</hi> at vnawares set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the armie of <hi>Hassan,</hi> &amp; ioyned battel with them.

At the last they vnderstood by certain spies, that they kept the way of <hi>Tomanis</hi> &amp; that <hi>Hassan Bassa</hi> with twenty thousand men was comming to this aid. This news caused them foorthi with to seatter themselues among the woods, all along the length of the said straite, hoping from thence to assaile the Turkes, and ouerthrowing them headlong into the deep valley, to bereaue them both of their goods and life.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Hassan,</hi> who had not so much care of any thing, as he
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:23114:80"/>

And in this maner did they passe the straites of <hi>Tomamis.</hi>

            <p>Now although they were not very far from <hi>Teflis,</hi> yet wold they needs make stay nere to the said straits, &amp; faining that they wold fauour and rest their men and their cattell, <note place="margin">The Turkiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that in such places sleights and stratagems are more auaila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than open forces, he took aduice, that a band of the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of <hi>Greece</hi> with a certaine troupe of the Aduenturiers, vnder the conduct of <hi>Resuan-Bassa,</hi> should lay themselues in ambushment within the thickest shades of the strait, and so being hidden, should diligentlie watch euery stirre of the enemy.

In this meane while, <hi>Simon</hi> perceiuing that the Turkes were remooued from those places that were neere vnto the straire, could not perswade himselfe that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Teflis,</hi> but imagined that they had taken this new way. And being afterward certified that it was so indeed, and informed of the trueth thereof by his faithfull spies, he ranne all headlong and as it was desperate to meete with that so happie Armie. And burning in anger and all infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with rage for this great fortune of the Turkes, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and blaspheming the heauens, hee arriued vpon the tayle of the Turkish hoast, which with vnmeasurable sury <note place="margin">Angry Simon destroyeth the taile of Hassans army</note> he did wholly destroy &amp; discomfit, leading away with him al the people all the horses, and all the treasure of <hi>Mahamet Bassa,</hi> which was brought from <hi>Teflis,</hi> &amp; all the treasure of <hi>Hassan Bassa</hi> likewise: putting to death &amp; taking prisoners the slaues &amp; vessals of both the Captaines, and shedding the bloud of many other souldiers.

               <hi>Mustaffa</hi> returned to the said Citie of <hi>Erzirum</hi> with al his Army, which was presently also by him discharged. And afterwards he sent aduertisementes of all these successes to the Court to <hi>Amurath,</hi> recounting vnto him the deserts of <hi>Hassan</hi> aswell for the succouring of <hi>Teflis,</hi> as also for the taking of Captaine <hi>Aliculi-Chan.</hi> And forasmuch as the last yeare the said General had perswaded <hi>Amurah,</hi> that the prouince of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and the people thereof were reduced vnder his obedience: to the end that he should not maruell at so many losses and so many battels, and thereby doubt of some lying and false information, hee declared vnto him, that all these difficulties were not raised by the natural and home-bred Georgians, who the last yeare had promised him al due obedience, but by two certain Captaines, <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Aliculi,</hi> sent out of <hi>Persia,</hi> who had mooued all these stirres, prepared all these dangers, and layd all these ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, although one of them now remayned with him in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, a worthy punishment for his malapert temerity. The king sent by two of his <hi>Capigi</hi> (or Gentlemen Hushers) to <hi>Hassan,</hi> a battle-axe al gilt, and setful of iewels, a Target of <note place="margin">Amurath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noreth Has<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san.</note> gold and pearle, and a garment of cloth of gold, in rewarde of his noble enterprises atchieued, commending him eat lie for his vertue and valour: and with great delight did he read-ouer all that <hi>Mustaffa</hi> had written vnto him, giuing order withall, that <hi>Aliculi</hi> should be kept, where hee was,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:23114:83"/>
in diligent and safe custodie.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Persia</hi> lying at <hi>Casbin</hi> was aduertised of all these successes, which being added to his newe thoughts touching his sonat <hi>Heri,</hi> wherof <hi>Mirize Salmas</hi> had enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, did greatly molest him. For on the one side, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident dangers, wherin all <hi>Georgia</hi> stood, did shrewdly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him, considering that the Stratageme so well deuised by <hi>Simon</hi> had no better successe, and the Turks had now made themselues throughly acquainted with all those passages, in the difficulty &amp; roughnes whereof consisted al his hope of defence: and moreouer vnderstanding that the <hi>Widowes</hi> sons wer become vassals to the Turk, which course <hi>Leuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> also propounded to himselfe, as one that was greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to be in confederacie with the <hi>Ottamans:</hi> and to bee brief, perceiuing that all the Georgian Captaines had setled themselues vnder the standardes of <hi>Amurath,</hi> hee could not but feare greatly, that his enemies would begin to pierce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the noble cities of <hi>Medili</hi> the greater, yea and peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture euen vnto <hi>Tauris</hi> before any of the rest. On the other side, he was as it were with a worm inwardly consumed, for the newes that were brought him by his Visier <hi>Mirize Salmas,</hi> of the euident suspition, which he told him, that his <note place="margin">Abas Mirize suspected of rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize Salmas the chief Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan of Casbin Mirize Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas hauing ma le the Persia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prince his son in law aduanced his estate.</note> son <hi>Abas Mirize</hi> of <hi>Heri,</hi> shuld (like a rebel and an ambitious youth) goe about to proclame himselfe king of the Persian empire, to the great ignominy of his father, and of <hi>Emir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamze</hi> his eldest sonne, who only was worthy to bee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his successour in that crowne.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Mirize Salmas,</hi> according to his longing desire, had maried a daughter of his to the saide <hi>Emirhamze</hi> with the consent of the king his father: but yet not content with that great honor, he ceased not continually with ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices to seek out meanes, how he might make the Persian
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:23114:84"/>
estate free from all other Seignuries, &amp; bring it to that passe as it might wholly remaine to his son, vndeuided &amp; entire, from the participation of his brethren. And therfore little regarding the perilles that might happen from the Turks, and blinded with the desire of his own greatnesse, he went about to turn the King against <hi>Abas Mirize,</hi> either to take him &amp; commit him to prison, or at least to leaue him void of all authority to command. And the better to perswade the king therunto (being a man very credulous &amp; nothing considerate, but putting more confidence in him than in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">The Persian king verie credulous &amp; inconsiderate</note> other) he began to discourse, that <hi>Abas Mirize</hi> his sonne had not greatly respected him in diuers occasions, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto him, that sundry times hee had very rashly scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his commandements, and because he would not shewe himself obedient &amp; inferiour vnto him, he wold not send so much as one souldier towards this war against the Turks; <note place="margin">Obiections against Abas Mirize<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and in fine he had caused himselfe not onely to bee called king of <hi>Heri,</hi> but he had also giuen it out, that he meant to claime the succession in the kingdome. And that therefore it was necessarie to feele the mind of the young youth, and to establish the tranquility and quiet of the Empire: to the end that if these stirres against the Turks went forwards, <hi>Abas Mirize</hi> should not be so hardy, as in the greatest heat of war to raise sudden tumults, &amp; to make himselfe Lord of that, which by right appertained to <hi>Emirhamze.</hi> Of these complaints he gaue the king diuers euident prooffs, which both in respect of the loue that he bare to <hi>Emirhamze,</hi> and also of the faith that he gaue to his Visier, caried a greate sway with him in his mind, especially they being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the crafty packing of the said Visier, who as hee was very cunning in such practises of himselfe, so did hee make them much more effectuall with the effeminate king
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:23114:84"/>
by the means of diuers Ladies &amp; other occasions that were <note place="margin">The Persian king effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note> familiar and vsual with him. But the most euident prooffe of all was this, that the saide Visier enformed the king, that whereas both by letters and commandements he had sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned the gouernours of <hi>Sasuar, Coran,</hi> &amp; other places sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the iurisdiction of <hi>Heri,</hi> to come to <hi>Casbin,</hi> and so to passe with <hi>Emirhamze</hi> to <hi>Siruan,</hi> yet neuer a one of them wold stir a foot, answering, that they were enioyned so to do by <hi>Abas Mirize</hi> their lord. This euidence was the most principal occasion, why euery thing that <hi>Mirize Salmas</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, was beleeued by the King, &amp; why he did continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bethink himself, how he might find opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the boldnes of his disobedient son. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing al these difficulties being otherwise perswaded by his most loyal and faithful Sultans, he did not fayl to temper these his internal motions, &amp; to tame these vnruly affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of his mind: &amp; remaining resolute in his important cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations against the Turks, to prepare such prouision, which should be sufficient to inhibit their passage to <hi>Tauris,</hi> if they had had any purpose so to do. Vpon which resolution ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resting himself, he neuer ceased til he had furnished all those prouisions, whereof a litle hereafter we will make mention, for that it is verie conuenient first to prosecute the history of those things that were reported of <hi>Mustaffa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He being returned (as we told you) to <hi>Erzirum,</hi> after so many external stirres &amp; troubles, was surprised by certain more intrinsecal, &amp; domestical quarrels at home: for manie grieuous complaints were there made of him to <hi>Amurath,</hi>

               </gap>armed men, and made so greate prouision with such a charge and expences to their Lorde, and with such a trouble of al the whole empire, and yet had not any worthy or notable enterprise to performe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by either the glorie of <hi>Amurath</hi> might receiue increase a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his enemies, or the souldiers themselues might be contented with some good bootie, or for any other action of importance. Whereupon they were all in an vprore, &amp; accused him of improuidence and prodigality, in that he had no regard of the wealth and subiects of his king. With these accusations did they the more odiously taxe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue <hi>Mustaffa,</hi> for that in the space of two years, wherein they had followed his wars, they neuer receuedfro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him any smal sign of curtesie, no not so much as the smallest reward: but alwaies like a tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he did reserue to his own vse althose presents and tokens of gratification, which by order from the king were due to all the souldiers, to encourage them that they might the more lustily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuein this war. These and such other complaints that were made of <hi>Mustaffa,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were of some moment, yet woulde the king neuer haue construed them so hardly against him, as for the same he wold haue bin induced to depriue him of his place: and without all doubt they had bene vtterly cancelled by reason of the great fauours which <hi>Amurath</hi> did beare vnto him, it the enuie which <hi>Sinan.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:23114:85"/>
being now exasperated by ancient and inveterate hatred, had not ministred strength &amp; force to all these accusations, &amp; set (as it were) an edge vpon <hi>Amurath</hi> to do what he did.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Sinan</hi> was a most ancient enemy to <hi>Mustaffa,</hi> and thought himself to be his match in al things. For if <hi>Mustaffa</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Sinan Bassa and Mustaffa, two ancien aduersaries.</note> had broght the Iland of <hi>Cyprus</hi> into the power of the Turks within the space of so many moneths, <hi>Sinan</hi> had also in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few dayes subdued <hi>La Goletta</hi> in <hi>Africa.</hi> And if <hi>Mustaffa</hi> were a man of great courage, and reuerend for his yeares, <hi>Sinan</hi> would be his equall both in the one and the other: yea and <hi>Sinan</hi> would not sticke to think himselfe to be his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (which indeed was supposed to be the originall of these bitter indignations) for that in the enterprise of <hi>Giamen,</hi> where <hi>Arabia Felix</hi> is, <hi>Sinan</hi> himselfe did an exployt, which <hi>Mustaffa</hi> neither durst nor was able, nor yet knew how to put in execution, and <hi>Sinan</hi> alone caried away the glory and entire honour of that famous victorie and important conquest. And euer after wardes there was nourished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them a thousand dissentions, so that the one of them did alwayes shewe himselfe aemulous and aduersarie to the other both in act and speach, as occasions fell out. At the last happens this opportunitie for <hi>Sinan,</hi> to declare vnto the King how the matters of <hi>Mustaffa</hi> were but slenderlie grounded, and taking occasion of the complaint of so many against him, he caused a great number of the to frame their supplication to the king, which he for his part did in most m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whom rather than they would follow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as their Captaine, all his people being in an vprore, shewed themselues readie and willing to aduenture themselues in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther far greater labour, that by their Lord and king shuld be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them.</hi> These and other such like complaints, which the king heard of <hi>Mustaffa,</hi> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as we told you before) he had already conceaued a hard opinion, because hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that the affaires of <hi>Georgia</hi> were not in any great se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, were the occasion why <hi>Amurath</hi> was resolued to put him from his place. Wherunto he did the more easily condiscend, because he did alwaies think it very dangerous to suffer one and the self same General to be any long time the minister of so great an enterprise, and Captaine of so many Squadrons: and besides, that he alwayes deemed it to be a small honor to him, if he should stil imploy but only one man, and that it would be greater honour to him, to shew that he had variety of subiectes, that were worthy of so great a charge. And therfore being desirous to find out the truth of that, which was reported vnto him touching <hi>Mustaffa,</hi> he sent for him to the Court, causing also two of his <hi>Deftardari</hi> or Treasurers to be brought with him, that <note place="margin">Mustaffa his two Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers brought to the Court.</note> they migh shew the accounts of such moneys as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued &amp; laid out, and to be short, giue vp an account of

            <p>In the time that <hi>Mustaffa</hi> remayned General at <hi>Erzirum,</hi> there departed out of this life <hi>Mahamet</hi> the principall Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier, who by a fraudulent &amp; treacherous mad foole, while <note place="margin">The death of Mahamet, the principall Vice-Roy.</note> he sate to giue audience in an open place, within his owne house, was suddainly, and to the common astonishment of all the companie, stroke through the bodie with a sharp <hi>Gangiara</hi> or (as we call it) a dagger.

And because he could not haue any fit means to put this his designment in execution, vnles hee might compasse some familiarity with <hi>Mahamet,</hi> by haunting his house, and conuersing domestically with him (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he could not be permitted to come neere him, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth that barbarous estate, by reason of the guarde of slaues, that keep the person of the Visier) he resolued to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell himself like an Eremit, which the Turks cal <hi>Dreuis,</hi> and to present himself euery morning before <hi>Mahamet</hi> to aske him his almes. And so he did, counterfeiting withal a certaine kinde of folly and lightnes of minde, to the end he might make the people beleeue, that the same had hapned vnto him through the grief which he had conceaued for

that it was very conuenient to put this matter in execution, being exhorted thereunto by <hi>Leuentogli,</hi> who although hee had bene iniured by the Persians, yet he could not but think it a dangerous thing to haue these warres so neere him: and being likewise hartened in it by his Visier <hi>Mirize Salmas,</hi> who was more intentiue towards the vniust suppressing of <hi>Abas Mirize</hi> of <hi>Heri,</hi> then he was for any sufficient repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or due prouisions for this warre, he resolued to sende <note place="margin">

Armie from the cities aboue named, to lead them with him to the execution of his designements.</p>
            <p>The Persian Embassadour entourmed <hi>Sinan</hi> of all that, whereof hee had to treat with the Turkish king on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe <note place="margin">The speach of the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to Sinan</note> of his king <hi>Mahamet:</hi> and laboured earnestly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him of the honesty of the request, and the equitie of the cause, declaring vnto him, that as vnder the lawe of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> their common Prophet, both the nations are conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, so that they ought with one vnitie and speciall concord defend and encrease their Names, by subduing the Christian people, who professing to worship the true God and the true Prophet, do possesse the most noble Cities of <hi>Europe:</hi> so was it a matter very inconuenient to contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues, and seeke to ouerthrow, yea and vtterly to destroy one another: it being a thing quite contrarye to that vnion, which should be among people of one &amp; the selfe same religion: it being also rather the property of brute &amp; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage beasts tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men, to driue &amp; expulse out of their natiue nest, those that are the followers and worshippers of one &amp; the self same Prophet. And although among so much people, and in such bredth &amp; largenes of cuntries ther be found per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture some signe of contrariety, &amp; some small shew of difference, yet for all that the matter is not so great, as that it shuld deserue such troublesom stirs, and kindle such ardent indignations, wherby he that is of greatest power shuld be moued to enter into another mans cuntries, &amp; endommage his neighbours. And that therfore he did hope to obtaine at the hands of <hi>Amurath</hi> this desited peace, if hee had no other cause wherwith he did find himselfe agreeued, as in trouth there was not, no nor euer was there any such thought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. Wherefore he besought him, that he woulde conueigh him with trustie guides to <hi>Amurath,</hi> to the end,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:23114:90"/>
that, if it were possible, they might not suffer these bloudy warres to goe forwards, at the report whereof, the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Nations of the East, yea and of all the whole worlde did reioyce, and stood wayting attentiuely to see what would be the issue of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sinan</hi> entertained the Embassadour after the best maner, <note place="margin">Sinan recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador.</note> that the rudenesse of his nature woulde permit him: and thinking with himselfe, that not onelie the losses and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage of the Persian king, but also the very fame of his valour in matters of warre, had wrought in the mindes of his enemies this resolution, to come and demaund peace (which he procured afterwards) he determined to pleasure the Embassador in the request which hee made vnto him for the conueighing of him to the Court: and accompanying him with a sure conuoy to send him to <hi>Constantinople:</hi> And wrote to <hi>Amurath</hi> in his letters all that which (hee thought) was fit to be demanded, representing vnto him what great and important matters (he hoped) might now be obtained, and raising in him woonderfull expectation of all happie successe, rather than motioning vnto him any feare or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of any vaine treatie. But before he dismissed the saide Embassador, he thought it good to aduise him, not to go to <hi>Amurath</hi> without resolution to offer him some great good conditions, and to yeeld vnto him all those landes <note place="margin">Admenitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Sinan to Maxut-chan the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</note> and all that countrey, which he with the valour of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes and with Armes had conquered, by ouercomming the forces of his enemies, by passing through the most hard and difficult waies, by climing the rough and craggierockes, by vvading ouer the moste violent riuers, that are in all <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Iberia:</hi> For hee knewe the minde of <hi>Amurath</hi> verie vvell, that hee vvas resolued in himselfe, not to yeeld so much as one hande breadth of that grounde which his

            <p>This demaund did greatly trouble <hi>Maxut-Chan,</hi> so that he began to fancie within himself, that he should not be able <note place="margin">Maxut-chan fearerh that he shal not conclude any thing.</note> to conclude any thing, and (if the said Embassadors son did not tell vs a lie, who diuers times did moste familiarly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with vs vpon euery particularitie, whiles we visited him in <hi>Aleppo)</hi> he was in a peraduenture to returne into <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> againe, and not to passe ouer to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing considering better with himselfe what belonged to his dutie, and doubting that this protestation might bee but an ambitious demand of <hi>Sinan</hi> himselfe, and hoping to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For he did at the first consider with himselfe howe contrarie it was to the mercifull nature of their common Prophete <hi>Mahamet</hi> to nourish contention &amp; much more to cause the publike spilling of the blood of his nations. Secondly he did
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:23114:93"/>
manifestly perceiue, how inconuenient a thing it was, that warre should succeed so suddenly vpon a peace, which was so royally and with so many sworre Capitulations conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded betweene <hi>Tamas</hi> and <hi>Soliman:</hi> after which peace Armes should neuer haue bene raised, but vpon some great quarrell and offence that should be offered. For certain it was, that the soule of him, who in his lyfe time was so readie and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to sweare to peace and amity, was nowe for the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating and breach thereof much grieued and offended in that happy life (he might better haue saide in Hell) and was now also accused for the same before God by the elect soules of <hi>Persia.</hi> And yet at his first comming to the kingdome his Maiestie might well perceaue, how greatly <hi>Persia</hi> reioyced at his happinesse, hauing made publike declaration thereof, by sending vnto him an Embassage to that purpose by Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan <hi>Tocomac,</hi> whereby hee might manifestly perceiue the good mind, and the maintenance of good faith and peace, on the behalfe of the Persian kings. And although in the shorte time of the raigne of ambitious <hi>Ismahell</hi> there was some rumour raised, that he meant to go into <hi>Babylonia,</hi> and some such like newes: yet it was but a youthly part, and an effect of that heat, which is commonly proper to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as being kept a long while in strait prison, cannot vse their liberty with moderate termes, and as they ought, and therefore he had receiued due punishment for it by his sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and vnexpected death. But the king that now is, aboue all other embraced amitie with his Maiesty, and did earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire not only, that he might not make war against him, but also that he might find fauour to bee linked in friendship and loue with him, and so they two together might prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the noble and worthy enterprises against the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Nations: which warre could not be but iust and honest,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:23114:93"/>
for that it tended to the inlargement of their natiue religion, and to the suppression of the enemies &amp; rebels to their own Prophet <hi>Mahamet.</hi> And that therefore his Maiesty would be pleased to temper and quench his anger conceaued, which had incensed him to take Armes against a king that was so friendly to him: and not to disturbe the peace of so many ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that were nere vnto him not only in situation but also in religion, and more kind vnto him, then all the rest of the Nations in the world.</p>
            <p>The King dismissed the Embassador without any other resolution at al: but only gaue order; that whatsoeuer he had <note place="margin">The order, which Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath gaue touching the Persian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador.</note> to discourse touching this peace, he shoulde communicate it with his Visier. Many were the courses and discourses that happened in this businesse: for that the Turke required all those Cities and Countries, which till that time hee had conquered with the swoord: and the Embassadour on the <note place="margin">The demands of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish King, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of a peace.</note> otherside had no warrant from his king to yeeld any more than was contained within <hi>Georgia,</hi> on this side the riuer <hi>Araxis,</hi> which hath beene so often mentioned heeretofore. Whereupon the said Ambassador coulde not but remaine in great feare, least he should be suspected for a spie, and so be ill entreated: where withall he did finde himselfe too mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festlie charged by the speech that the Visier vsed towardes him. But hauing no further warrant, than is abouesaid, hee knewe not wherupon to resolue himselfe, or how he might remedie the euident danger of imprisonment or of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther smister accident, and so finde meanes to be licensed to returne.

with his king <hi>Mahamet,</hi> the yelding vp of so much as <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> had &amp; did demand.

And it is a very dangerous matter for an Historiographer to write diffusedly and at random of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters so secrete, for that in such extrauagations he may easily slip into a lie: the greatest monster &amp; absurdity, that can be in one that writeth an historie) certaine it is, that <hi>Maxut-Chan</hi> was friendly and without any outrage sent from <hi>Con stantinople</hi> to <hi>Chars,</hi> where <hi>Sinan</hi> was then with his army, &amp; commission was giuen to <hi>Sinan,</hi> that without delay, and with all fidelity he should cause the Persian to be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied <note place="margin">Maxut sent without any outrage to Chars.</note> to <hi>Van,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Persia,</hi> wheresoeuer the said Embassadour did especially desire: all which was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly performed, as shall be set down in due place.</p>

            <p>At the last <hi>Maxut-Chan</hi> arriued in <hi>Persia</hi> before the King, to whom he reported al that which hapned in this his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage: <note place="margin">Maxut-Chan telleth the K. what he had done.</note> the sum whereof was, that the Turkish king would not otherwise condiscend to any condition of peace, vnlesse there might be yeelded vnto him al the whole cuntry of <hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uan,</hi> euen as far as <hi>Demir-Capi</hi> inclusiuely, presuming that all that country belonged vnto him, which he had already got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and conquered by his famous battels.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Fort at Teflis.</note> suecors which he brought, among the souldiers of the sort, comforting them with good speeches, &amp; with lustie &amp; liuely promises of great matters. And foramuch as all the souldiers there made great complaints against the Bassa, that was their Captain in the fortresse, <hi>Sinan</hi> caused an information, or (as the Turks cal it) a <hi>Teflis</hi> to be framed against him, &amp; hauing found him guilty that he had conuerted the souldiers pay to his own vse, he condemned him in restitution thereof, and discharging him immediatly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his office, he did substitute in his place <hi>Giusuf Bey,</hi> one of the Georgian Lordes, who for <note place="margin">Guisuf Bey, the Runegat put in trust with the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Teflis fort.</note> the ancient enmity between him and <hi>Simon</hi> had yeelded him self to the Turks, &amp; was by them so welcommed, that <hi>Sinan</hi> trusted him with the oustody of that fort, which with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangers had bene maintained and defended till that day.</p>
            <p>When this was done, <hi>Sinan</hi> departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence with al his army, &amp; while he was vpon his departure ther arriued Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors from <hi>Leuentogli</hi> lord of <hi>Zaghen</hi> (of whom we haue oftentimes made mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before) who wer very wel welcom <note place="margin">Ambassadors from Leuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togli to Sina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> to <hi>Sinan,</hi> especially for that aswel by their relation, as also by the testimony of the souldiers of <hi>Teflis</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, he had bin certified how much good <hi>Leuentogli</hi> had done vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by sending to the fort vittails, money, &amp; whatsoeuer els he had that might be commodious for them in that their continual necessity, Which in trueth was so great, that it was an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:23114:99"/>
of spreaidng abroad a general fame, whereby it was reported, that the said Fort was yeelded by the Turks to the <hi>Georgiani,</hi> yea and the rumor of it passed euen into <hi>Italy.</hi> But <note place="margin">The rumour prooued false that Teflis was yeelded.</note> it was all false: For notwithstanding so great penurie of all things, and so great a siege, yet was the Fort still maintained and held in the possession of those fortunate people: Which was afterwardes the matter and occasion of continuing those motions and mutations, which after fell out so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to the state of Christendom. The Embassadors excused their Lord, for not comming himselfe in person, to do reuerence to <hi>Sinan,</hi> for that his sicknesse and certen other priuat respects did hinder him from doing that, which hee both desired, and also ought to haue done. All which was most acceptable to <hi>Sinan,</hi> who in sign therof caused the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors of <hi>Leuentogli,</hi> to be apparelled in cloth of gold, and <note place="margin">Sinan hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors.</note> sent vnto himself a battel-axe and sword all gilt and set with iewels, promising vnto him great matters, and with gallant words declaring vnto him his exceeding affection of loue &amp; confederacie with him. Yea and some say, that <hi>Sinan</hi> sent letters to <hi>Alesiandro</hi> himself, wherein he made a motion vnto him for some treaty of peace, telling him, that hee being a friend both to the Turks and to the Persians, ought to trie al the means he could to pacifie these troubles, and to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the minds of the two kings. But in truth what was done in so secrete a matter, I could neuer yet learne any certenty to write: and therfore without any further speach of it, wee wil prosecute the progresse of <hi>Sinans</hi> armie.</p>
            <p>The day following, <hi>Sinan</hi> &amp; his army passed the strait of <hi>Tomanis,</hi> &amp; then came before him <hi>Mutafsade Bassa,</hi> borne in <note place="margin">Mutafsade to General Sina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>

communicated his intended deceyte. The <hi>Georgian Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taffa</hi> was called accordingly, who, both because he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of moe then one, and also because hee vsed all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and forecast, and specially because euen in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my he had perceiued some priuie whisperings of such a matter, knew full wel, that all this was deuised against him, and imagined that the conspiracie had beene farre greater then indeede it was: whereupon he also prepared for his owne defence. And touching his going to the <hi>Diuano,</hi> he thought he might not deny so to doe, least by his absence he should be condemned for contumacy, &amp; so he himselfe shoulde make himselfe guilty and culpable of the fault, that (peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture not without reason) was imputed vnto him, and thereby leaue his cities for a pray to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:23114:113"/>
Euen so it would haue fallen out this yeare also, if the King had put his aduise in execution, asmuch as hee despised &amp; contemned it: For he did then giue him to vnderstand that <hi>Mahamet Bassa</hi> could not be a fit man for the leading of those succours, especially to such a station or place, and that it was very necessary to haue chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his rowm, some other person of valor, of worth, and of wisdome: but seing he would needs make choice of the same <hi>Mahamet,</hi> hee was not now to blame any other for this errour, but onely himselfe. And touching his comming to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> it was a thing long before thought to bee very needfull, not onely for his aduise howe the matter of peace might bee brought to some good passe, but also because (if that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie came not to the desired issue,) then hee had to talke with him, howe hee might easily compasse the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of his enemie: which matter as yet he had no fitte time to declare vnto him, but was now most readie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale it, if it would so please him. Wonderfully was <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> greeued with this his answere, when hee considered <note place="margin">Amurath greeuously offended with Sinan.</note> that a slaue of his owne, should thus reproch him with a matter that was so odious, and so manifestly touched his follie and improuidence: notwithstanding he dissembled his discontentment conceiued against him, and was verie desirous to know of him, what that secrete and important matter was, which he had to reueale vnto him, for the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie compassing of this commenced enterprise: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after he had framed him a glosing replie, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Sinan</hi> to display all his conceites, and to disclose those his deuises, which he had to vtter.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:23114:113"/>
&amp; ioined with the king (as it were) in disdain &amp; scorne of his arrogancie, who for a briefe of al his aduises propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded these two thinges. First, his counsaile was, that they should not proceede in this warre as they had hithereto done, that is to say, by seeking with fortes and fortresses <note place="margin">The first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise of Sinan.</note> to hold and keepe their enemies countries. For (as in the verie beginning of this war, whiles consultation was had in what manner and sorte it should be made, hee had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly protested) he did manifestly foresee, that their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sende</hi> or treasuries were not able to yeeld such store of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as was sufficient for the maintenance of necessarie garrisons, and so the error of <hi>Mustaffa</hi> (that nowe is dead) was euidently conuinced, who so obstinatelie had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded such a dangerous and difficult manner of warfare. His seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d aduise was, that the true meanes to bring these <note place="margin">The second aduise of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan.</note> stirs to a wishid ende consisted especiallie in the resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the king himselfe, whom if it would please but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue a little fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinople,</hi> for three or foure daies iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys onely, and to passe either into <hi>Caraemit,</hi> or into <hi>Alep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po,</hi> or at least into <hi>Amasia,</hi> hee might assuredly promise to himselfe all speedie &amp; honourable victory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for at the onelie name of his remoue, either the <hi>Persians</hi> would not stande too obstinately vpon conditions of peace, but would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely come to any agreement, or els he might continue his wars, &amp; so obtaine great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quests. These were the reasons that <hi>Sinan</hi> propounded whereof it seemeth no other thing followed but onelie an enuious affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the king against him, quite contrarie to the conceit which before hee had of him, &amp; (which was a matter of greater importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Women are of gret might with Amurath</note> suspition (fostered by these mightie Ladies,) that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> had thus counselled the king himselfe to goe in person from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> not for any good that coulde arise by

they were to reueale without any blame or accusation of <hi>Emir-Hamze,</hi> and to make it knowen to his old father, that neuer any such conceits or affections were kindled in the Prince, but that he was also vnwares induced thereunto by the crafte and suttlety of malignant <hi>Salmas.</hi>
               </q>

            <p>The two Embassadours came accordingly, and <note place="margin">The excuses of the embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors in the behalfe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas Mirize.</note> after many speeches, in the ende, swearing (according to their custome) by the Creator that spread out the Aire, that founded the earth vppon the deepes, that adorned the heauen with starres, that powred abroade the water, that made the fire, and briefely of nothing brought foorth all thinges: swearing by the heade of their vaine Master <hi>Aly,</hi> and by the false religion of their impious Prophet <hi>Mahamet:</hi> swearing by their children, by their wiues, by their own souls, That such peruers thoughts neuer entred <note place="margin">The Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the King and the Prince are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</note> into the head of <hi>Abas-Mirize:</hi> 
               <q>They alledged many testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and euident proofes, that most loyally and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, in all due time, aswell when hee was aduanced to the soueraigne degree of a king, as also in his battels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Turkes, his Sonne had alwaies caused deuout prayers and supplications to bee made to God for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritye, neither euer desired to heare any other but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie and fortunate successe of him. They brought with them a thousande and a thousand Precepts and Royall Letters, which the younge man had caused to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as occasions required, to the Gouernours that were his Subiectes for the gouernement of the state, wherein hee neuer named himselfe the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> but onelye your King and Gouernour of <hi>Heri.</hi>
               </q>  They prayed the King also that hee woulde cause a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent processe (which the Turkes call a <hi>Teftis)</hi> to be framed against his Sonne, and if there shoulde bee

founde in him any signe or shadowe of so wicked a suspicion, that then hee woulde take from him his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state and libertie.For they woulde remaine as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages <note place="margin">The Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against Mirize Salma.</note> for him. <q>But when all this shoulde be done, and <hi>Abas-Mirize</hi> shoulde bee founde altogether free from these vniust and impious calumniations, then (falling euen to the earth and kissing it,) they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him and coniured him, that hee woulde not leaue the matter thus imperfect, to the preiudice of his bloude: but returning to his counsellor, he would likewise take information, vppon what minde or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration it was well knowen that he had aduised the King to take vpon him this vnorderly and daungerous vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. For without doubt hee shoulde finde nothing in him but malignant, ambitious, and wicked affections, and such as euen deserued, that with his bloud there should be reuenged all the bloud of those, which till that houre had beene brought to their vnworthie and vndeserued death. And forasmuch as there remained one onely diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to be cancelled &amp; cleared, wherof the <hi>Visier</hi> had infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the king, touching a commaundement that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by <hi>Abas-Mirize</hi> to the gouernors that were vnder him, as namely to the gouernour of <hi>Sasuar</hi> and of other places, that they should not goe to the warre against the Turkes: they confessed in trueth, that such an order was taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, but not to that vniust and slanderous end, as it was related to the king by the <hi>Visier,</hi> but onely in respect of the warres, that were reported to be begun in those quarters by the <hi>Tartarian Iesselbas,</hi> who by diuers into ades hauing robbed the Cities, the Townes, and the Fieldes of <hi>Heri,</hi> had put such a feare in younge <hi>Abas-Mirize</hi> and all his Counsellours, that they durste not emptye their
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:23114:121"/>
Cities of their guardes and forces, and thereupon (as they should finde it true, if they woulde enquire thereof) the saide Gouernours were commanded that they should not goe to the war against the Turks, but that they should expect further direction, whereof they shoulde haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, if they should be called for.</q> And that all this was signified by writing to the <hi>Visier</hi> himselfe, but that hee of a malignant minde had concealed the same: onely to try, if in these common troubles hee coulde bring it to passe, that <hi>Abas-Mirize</hi> and the king might bee bereaued of their liues, and <hi>Emir-hamze</hi> succeed in their place, and so hee himselfe remaine the Super-intendent of his sonne in law, and Moderator of rather the Tyrant of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie and famous kingdome. Which (they saide) they made knowen vnto him, not because they thought <hi>Emir-hamze</hi> to bee acquainted with so treacheious a traine, (for they knewe very well, how greatly in imitation of his Fathers pietie, hee hated dissension among kinsefolkes, &amp; shedding of bloude) but onely because it was throughlye discouered to bee the most vnlawful and vnreasonable desire of the wicked traitor <hi>Mirize-Salmas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verie graue and strange cogitations did these auncient Orators raise in the mindes of the two Princes: and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamet</hi> the Father, beeing by nature credulous and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant beyond measure, began to make great construction of their speeches, and deepely to consider of their so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and important requestes, whose offers also seemed <note place="margin">The offers of the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the King and the Prince.</note> vnto him so vpright and equall, that he could not choose but accept thereof. And therefore calling vnto him the Gouernours, the Captaines, the Iudges and Treasurers of all the Cities that were subiecte to <hi>Heri,</hi> hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of them, how and in what sorte they esteemed
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:23114:121"/>
of <hi>Abas-Mirize,</hi> and how &amp; in what degree of honour he desired to be esteemed of them. And of them all he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued an vniforme aunswere, that they helde him for their Lord, as the Lieutenant to the king of <hi>Cas-bin,</hi> and that he himselfe did alwais desire so to be taken &amp; thoughtof. And euerie of them brought in diuers Letters, Precepts, and Orders, wherein hee neuer caused himselfe to bee honoured with any other title, but onely, your king of <hi>Heri.</hi> Hee demaunded further, whether those tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults of warres were indeede attempted by the <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Iesselbas</hi> or no: whereof hee receiued also a large and solemne information, that so it was, to the greate detriment of all those territories. And thus the king was throughly persuaded of the innocencie of his son, <note place="margin">King Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie of his Sonne.</note> who before was noted vnto him by his <hi>Visier</hi> to bee an obstinate rebell. Vpon which occasion onely, although hee might iustly haue put his <hi>Visier</hi> to death, as one that had beene the cause of the slaughters that happened, and of the bloud of so many valorous Captaines that was shed so iniuriouslie: yet because he would be better informed of the trueth of the accusations laid againste him by the Embassadours of <hi>Heri,</hi> the rather to ridd himselfe from so important and so iust a feare: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he doubted also peraduenture, least there had beene some conspiracie plotted against him betwene the <hi>Visier</hi> and <hi>Emir-hamze:</hi> hee resolued to make a curious and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent inquisition thereof. And therefore first of all, in great secrecie, calling vnto him <hi>Emir-hamze,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding of him by all faire meanes, howe and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">King Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met trieth the Princes mind.</note> hee had aduised and procured this iourney against <hi>Abas-Mirize,</hi> Son to himselfe &amp; Brother to him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeede he had founde him innocent of al those crimes
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:23114:122"/>
that were layde to his charge: he receaued aunswere from the Prince that hee had no other certeyntie of the pretended ill behauiour of his brother, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which proceeded from the greate credite that hee alwayes bare towardes his Father in Lawe <hi>Mirize Salmas,</hi> to whome, as to a Visier, and as to his Father in Lawe, and as to a Protectour of <note place="margin">All the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes light vpon Salmas the Visier.</note> the Kingdome, and finally as to a person that had beene tryed in a thousande matters to bee true and trustie, hee had alwayes yeelded assured credence, in all such matters, as daylye were in speech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them. Insomuch that hee discharged the whole Tempest of all these mischiefes vppon the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier, Touching whome the King made diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition aswell among those of the Courte as of the Armie, and thereby founde verye straunge and vnexpected Nouelties. For there was not a man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, that did not accuse him, for a seditious man, <note place="margin">Mirize Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas accused by all.</note> for a Cruell man, for an vniust man, and for a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and to bee briefe that did not make him guiltie of very haynous crimes, and in particular for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation layd against him by the Embassadours of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> they all declared, that in trueth hee was alwayes made acquaynted with the true occasions, which did restrayne the Gouernours subiecte to <hi>Abas Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize</hi> (from going to the Warre against the Turkes,) but that hee most malioiously had concealed the same, of purpose onely to hatch such a straunge and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous stirre; in hope to aduance his owne estate by the destruction of others. And so at last <hi>Mirize Salmas</hi> was detected for guiltie, &amp; rewarded with that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he desired vniustly to conuert vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:23114:122"/>
For the King, who had nowe founde such impietie in him, as besides that hee had caused manie Sultans of accompt to bee vniustly and vnworthely put to death, he also went about to procure, that the Father shoulde defyle himselfe with the bloude of his owne Sonne, (a thing so odious both to the King himselfe and all his kingdome, as euer anie cruell Action coulde possiblie bee,) the King (I saye) coulde not suffer this impietie, but acknowledging a fresh the innocencie of the one, and the guylte of the other, the one hee deliuered and embraced as his Sonne, the other he auaunted out of his presence, and punishing him as an impious person, hee caused his heade to bee cutte from his Carcase. In this <note place="margin">Mirize Salmas beheaded by the Kings or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> manner, the ambitious Visier, as though hee had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily gone to his owne death, tourned all these an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and tumultes against himselfe, and with his owne destruction pacified the dissentions and hatredes that were fostered in the two Princes mindes. And <hi>Emir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamze,</hi> when hee had nowe discouered the wickednesse of his Father in Lawe, tooke it also in verie good parte that hee was depriued both of his state and life. And so the two brethren beeing reconcyled together, and <note place="margin">K. Mahamer with the Prince retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin.</note> the Sonne to the Father, after that <hi>Abas Mirize</hi> had agayne promised his wished obedience (which hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde willinglie performed,) <hi>Kinge Mahamet</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with the Prince towardes <hi>Casbin,</hi> where by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of sodayne and vnexpected newes hee had nowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long time beene looked for and desired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amurath,</hi> through the roughe speeches, and vnluckie prognostications of Sinan, was more and more settled in his purpose to continue this Warre, hopinge that hee woulde cause all the threatteninge
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:23114:123"/>
of <hi>Sinan</hi> to bee but vaine, and to reape so much the more glorie by his happie successe in such an enterprise, as it should fall out contrarie to the common opinion of all men. And thereupon began to bethinke himselfe whome he might choose for his Generall, and to him not onelie to commit such a charge, but also to communicate all his deuises. Till that time, <hi>Osman Bassa</hi> was appoynted bee the man, but <hi>Amurath</hi> thinking that <hi>Osman</hi> might prooue more seruiceable in <hi>Siruan,</hi> and thereby the better assure and establish the conquest of that Region, durste not so soone remoue him from thence. Among the <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saes</hi> of the Court there was one <hi>Ferat,</hi> a man of ripe yeares, but yet fierce of courage, tough in opinion, in counsell as hardie as might beseeeme his age, ready for all sodeine and strange aduentures, but aboue all a vassall most deuoted to the King, and happely he had performed some good office, why he was the rather now called forth by <hi>Amurath</hi> to this seruice. Of this man at the last hee <note place="margin">Ferat a Bassa of the Court.</note> was resolued to make choyce to bee the Captaine of his Armie. And therefore hee called him to him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with him all his priuie dessignements and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete deuises necessarie for this warre, encouraging him to take paynes, to fight battels, to obtayne victories, and to doe all thinges else agreeable to so worthie an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise. Verie willingly did <hi>Ferat</hi> accept of this newe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <note place="margin">Ferat Bassa e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in Sinans place.</note> and thought himselfe to bee highly fauoured by the King, and so disposed himselfe to performe the same, so farre as he coulde employ his strength, his wit and his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thereupon made him a large promise, that hee woulde put in execution, whatsoeuer shoulde be offered vnto him either by occasion, or by his Royall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. Which although the King should not haue
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:23114:123"/>
vrged any further, but onely to assure the passage to <hi>Teflis,</hi> and all <hi>Georgia,</hi> and principally to destroye the countrie of <hi>Mustaffa</hi> the <hi>Georgian,</hi> who had so audaciouslie iniured the Lieutenant of <hi>Amurath</hi> and set his whole Armie in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, yet beeing certified by <hi>Maxut-Chan</hi> the Rebell of <hi>Persia,</hi> and being aduertised by his subiecte <hi>Bassaes</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained neere to <hi>Tauris,</hi> howe King <hi>Mahamet</hi> was depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or atleast was vpon the poynt of departing to <hi>Heri,</hi> to <note place="margin">Amurath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberateth what should be done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition of Ferat.</note> trie his Sonnes minde, hee chaunged his purpose, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berating the matter with himselfe, hee commaunded <hi>Ferat</hi> to employ all his Force and diligence to erect a Fabrike at <hi>Reiuan,</hi> a place belonging to <hi>Tocomac,</hi> and to assure the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage that leadeth from <hi>Chars</hi> to <hi>Raiuan.</hi> For so they shoulde be reuenged of manie treacheries and dammages which they had receyued by <hi>Tocomac,</hi> and the way to the Citie of <hi>Tauris</hi> shoulde bee made open, to the great glory of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath.</hi> Hee aduised <hi>Ferat</hi> also, that although hee knew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well, it were his duetie to chastize <hi>Mustaffa</hi> the <hi>Georgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> for his rash attempt against <hi>Mahamet Bassa,</hi> being then his Generall: yet he thought it better, that hee should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble and conceale his ill opinion of him, and (if it might bee possible) to worke so, as hee might conueigh the treasure and succours to <hi>Teflis.</hi> For by this meanes, the passage beeing made safe and secure, without anye moe Fortresses or Fabrikes, all <hi>Georgia</hi> woulde bee subdued, and the next yeare they might attempt the enterprise of <hi>Tauris.</hi>

            <p>Verie highlie did <hi>Ferat</hi> commende the deuises of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi> and shewed himselfe readie for anie attempt.

And therefore the Captaine was constrained to yeelde and obey his Soulders, and to auoide theire despitefull and sharpe threates, to his exceeding great reproach, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as they had commaunded, to remooue from those quarters. The first day hee arriued at <hi>Ardachan,</hi> with <note place="margin">Ferat at Arda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan.</note> the verie great annoyance and trouble of all the souldiers: for whereas the iourney was wont to bee two daies worke ordinarilie, aswell in respecte of the long waie, as also of the passage ouer a verie rough and difficult mountaine, the Generall woulde needes haue it dispatched in one onely daie, the rather thereby to afflicte and grieue the Souldiers. But for this his reuenge hee receiued euen the selfe same daie his due rewarde, for that the Chariots, wherein his wemen rode were conueyed away, together with their <hi>Eunuches</hi> that were their keepers: some saie, by the <hi>Georgians,</hi> that in those woodes and cragges of the <note place="margin">Generall Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat his wemen stolen away from him.</note> mountaine lay in ambushe, waiting for some such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: and others say, by the <hi>Giannizzaries,</hi> who altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dishonour the Captaine, wrought him this iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.

But no lesse then the rest, was the <hi>Turkish</hi> king discontented with him, for two verie mightie and weightie considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Secondly for that without any care, he had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>Alyculi-Chan</hi> to escape away: about whose flight he could not choose but haue some intelligence and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as beeing the onely man, that in all the strange haps which happened in the former yeers of this warre had continually celebrated &amp; renewed the fresh memory of his seruiceable actions. For <hi>Ferar,</hi> who (as we told you before) by the new order, which he receiued from the Court, was to diuert his iourney from <hi>Nassiuan,</hi> to the straites and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe passages of <hi>Georgia,</hi> beeing desirous to bee through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enformed in all those waies, that with most ease might leade him into those places, and withall to bee acquainted with al those difficult &amp; perilous corners, where the <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> were wont to hide themselues in ambushes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their treacheries, resolued with himselfe (in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yeare when hee remoued from <hi>Erzirum</hi>) to take <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyculi-Chan</hi>

And therefore he caried him with him, vnder a certain guard (whatsoeuer it was afterwards) of his most faithfull vassels, &amp; caused him to be wel intreated, by yelding vnto him the benefit &amp; enioying of whatsoeuer he needed. At the last they arriued in <hi>Georgia,</hi> at the streits of <hi>Tomanis,</hi> where we told you the forenamed Castell was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and from thence hee escaped secretly into <hi>Parsia.</hi> The manner of his escape is diuersly reported.

For the <hi>Turcoman Nation,</hi> who among other Captaines, (from whence <hi>Persia</hi> receiued her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and dignities) made great accompt of <hi>Emir-Chan,</hi> and by him was greatly honoured, at this death of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <note place="margin">The Turcoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Nation great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended for the death of EmirChan their captaine</note> highly offended, and were notably discontended, yea, &amp; their indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> encreased so at the last that being become rebellious and an vtter enemie to that Crowne, they did absolutely denie their forces to the publike de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof. This their wrath and anger was also much more aggrauated, when they hearde that the King had bestowed the rowme of <hi>Emir-Chan,</hi> vpon <hi>Alyculi</hi> the fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, <note place="margin">Newe discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments of of the Turco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannes.</note> who was escaped out of prison from <hi>Ferat,</hi> as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue shewed.

And these were the euents of this season of the yeare. 1584.

But besides the information of <hi>Ferat,</hi> there wanted not many other that did the like also, although in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:23114:140"/>
another manner. For the King was aduertised, and that in an odious sorte, of all the whole proceedings of <hi>Ferat,</hi> the escape of <hi>Alyculi-Chan,</hi> the shamefull losse of his we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, his quarrels with the <hi>Giannizzaries,</hi> the disorders <note place="margin">Others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the king more Particularly of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sightes of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</note> that fell out, through his want of wisedome, amonge all the <hi>Bassaes</hi> of the whole Campe, especially his enimity with <hi>Veis Bassa,</hi> who by the king himselfe was thought to be a man of valour and prudence, and to bee shorte all the particulars of the actions, that had not altogether so honorably beene performed in that yeere: which in truth of themselues onely were causes sufficiente to induce the king to remooue the saide <hi>Ferat</hi> from the Office that he exercised. To these occasions there were also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded sundry other priuate respectes. For euer sithens the departure of <hi>Ferat</hi> out of <hi>Erzirum</hi> to builde the Fortres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <note place="margin">Osman Bassa thought by Amurath to be a worthy Captaine.</note> at <hi>Lory</hi> and <hi>Tomanis, Amurath</hi> had it still in his heade the next yeer following to attempt the enterprise of <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and therein to make triall of the most famous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines that hee had: thinking with himselfe, that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of <hi>Reiuan</hi> and <hi>Chars</hi> being so safely setled, there was no reason any longer to delaye or slacke the passage to <hi>Tauris</hi> and thereby to stirre vppe through all the worlde a famous reporte of greate exploytes, and a glorie correspondent to so daungerous an attempte. Nowe among the Captaines, whom <hi>Amurath</hi> esteemed to be worthy men, to whom he might with trust commit this enterprise, he bethought himselfe of <hi>Osman Bassa</hi> who (wee tolde you) was lefte at <hi>Sumachia</hi> in <hi>Siruan</hi> by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Mustaffa,</hi> the first yeere of this warre, and whose iourney to <hi>Demir-Capi</hi> we described afterwards, together with suche other matters as hee performed againste <hi>Ares-Chan</hi> and <hi>Sahamal,</hi> in assuring the Conquest of that
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:23114:140"/>
Citie. The good opinion, that <hi>Amurath</hi> had thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of <hi>Osman,</hi> did springe &amp; arise in his head, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the exploits done by him, which wee haue suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently aboue declared, but also, yea and much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that hee maintained so greate an Armie, in a Countrey so farre distant, without any expences at al to the king, hauing nowe a good while leauied the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Stipendes vppon the landes and territories of that Region, and still exercised a kinde of gouernement and soueraigntie ouer those places. Of all which his good proceedings, <hi>Osman</hi> caused intelligence to be sent to the Court sundrie times in the yeare, discoursing vppon the State of all thinges, and howe without any helpe of the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> who since the death of <hi>Adilcherai</hi> neuer came to assist him, hee had assured and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Conquest for euer. By these meanes, and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Amurath hath great hope of the valour of Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bassa.</note> fauours which <hi>Osman</hi> had about the king, there was fostered in the minde of <hi>Amurath</hi> a wonderfull good opinion of him, but although (as wee haue sayed) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer since the departure of <hi>Ferat</hi> out of <hi>Erzirum</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yeere, hee was throughly perswaded of the vertue of <hi>Osman,</hi> yet was he not resolued (as then) to call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, for that hee was hindered by the Nouelties that arose in <hi>Georgia,</hi> and stayed by a kinde of hope, that hee had conceiued of some better establishmente in the affaiers of <hi>Siruan.</hi> And nowe hauing settled all those borders, in such sorte as wee haue described, and opened the passage in manner aforesaide, he thought it good to stay no longer, but resolued with himselfe to cut of al further delay, &amp; to cause him to come to him, to <hi>Constantinople:</hi> &amp; for that purpose, before, that <hi>Ferat</hi> was ariued at <hi>Erziru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the king had disparched certen <hi>Capigi</hi> &amp;
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:23114:141"/>
               <hi>Chiaus</hi> to call this famous warriour vnto him: and thereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, <note place="margin">Certaine mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers and gentlemen vshers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to call Osman to Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> in the next spring, they began to make prouision of new attempts and new Captaines.</p>
            <p>But there wanted not some, that went about to hinder both his comming &amp; also these dissignements that were of great importance. At that time by reason of the death of the three <hi>Visiers</hi> before named, and the banishment of <hi>Sinan</hi> aboue also declared, there had succeeded in the place of the chiefe <hi>Visier, Sciaus Bassa,</hi> son in law to <hi>Amurath,</hi> next vnto whom it was <hi>Osmans</hi> course to sit in the order of those <hi>Bassaes,</hi> that were aduanced to that honor. But <hi>Sciaus,</hi> who rather for the comelinesse of his person, and alliance with the king, then for anie other thing was mounted to those highe rowmes, did greatly feare, least partely for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in matters of warre, and particularly for the good affection and trust which the king did beare to <hi>Osman,</hi> at this his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to Constantinople he might perswade the king to what hee listed: and so peraduenture it might fall out, that he would take from him the chiefest office, and get the vniuersal gouernment of the whole Empyre, wher by so great wealth was to bee gained and purchased. And <note place="margin">Sciaus endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoreth to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bassa to the Court in his place.</note> therefore hee had euerie date new stinges arising in his mind, and sundrie cogitations how hee might ridde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of these feares, and finde meanes to auoide his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Court. And because it was a verie dangerous matter openly to attempt the same, and might peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be an easie meanes to make him forgoe his life, hee thought it better to make triall of a more commodious &amp; trustie meane. This <hi>Sciaus,</hi> in consideration of many gifts and rewards, which the <hi>Cuman Tartarian</hi> had often bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon him, had continually endeuored to cleere him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the king of diuers accusations, which <hi>Osman</hi> by his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:23114:141"/>
was wont to lay to his charge, &amp; for all his ouersights to alledge such reasons in his behalf, as if they did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade <hi>Amurath</hi> to bee altogether kinde and courteous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, yet at the least not to carrie a malitious &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious conceit against him. And so farre had hee procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in countenancing and fauouring the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> that <note place="margin">Freindship betweene Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus the Visier, &amp; the Cuman Tartarian.</note> there was established and confirmed an enterchaungea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amitie and mutuall confederacie betweene them: but besids this their reciprocall friendship, there quickened in the heart of <hi>Sciaus</hi> a certaine assured imagination, that the said <hi>Tartarian</hi> king would vse al the waies and meanes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, to hinder the comming of <hi>Osman</hi> to Constantinople, yf hee were but made acquainted with his comming. And therefore <hi>Sciaus,</hi> assoone as hee vnderstoode the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine resolution of <hi>Amurath,</hi> to call <hi>Osman</hi> to the Court, before he saw the <hi>Chiaus</hi> and the <hi>Capigi</hi> dispatched, which went with the Kinges commaundement to fetch him, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly wrote to the <hi>Cuman Tartar,</hi> who lay encamped neere to the hauen of <hi>Caffa</hi> vpon the Moore of Moeotis, certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying him that <hi>Osman</hi> was to come to the Courte: and <note place="margin">Sciaus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the Tartar of Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Court.</note> that therefore hee woulde call to minde how great an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie hee had beene to him, and how much hee had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuored by letters to <hi>Amurath,</hi> to turne all his hatred and displeasure against him: <q>and withall, that if hee was able to doo so much by letters, as if <hi>Sciaus</hi> had not defended him with verie reasonable excuses, the king had execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his wrathfall minde vpon him to his greate losse and detrimente, hee shoulde then imagine with himselfe, what <hi>Osman</hi> woulde bee able to doe, when hee shoulde come in person to the presence of <hi>Amurath,</hi> and without anie mediatour determine betweene themselues of all matters, whatsoeuer they shoulde thinke to bee conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:23114:142"/>
for the common quiet.</q> These &amp; peraduentur worse were the letters, which <hi>Sciaus</hi> wrote to the <hi>Tartar,</hi> which ministred matter enough vnto him, to encourage him to his barbarous and cruell designement: and hauing fully resolued with himselfe, not to suffer so pernicious an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of his owne to arriue at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and also to rid his mind of so great a feare, and especially perceiuing that <hi>Sciaus,</hi> in whose breast he reposed all his hope and all his protection, did so greatly feare his comming, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, that twelue thousand souldiers, chaungnig their weapons and apparrell, should goe and lie in await for <hi>Osman,</hi> in the borders betweene <hi>Colchis</hi> and <hi>Iberia,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">The order, which the Tartarian ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite Osma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s comming to Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> the <hi>Tartarian Nomades,</hi> and so making an assault vpon him, to bereeue him of his life, hoping that such an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage either could not or would not bee imputed to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement, but rather either to the <hi>Tartar Nomades,</hi> or to the <hi>Mengrellians,</hi> or to the <hi>Georgians,</hi> or to the <hi>Moscouites,</hi> or to the <hi>Theeues</hi> by the high way: and to bee short, rather to any bodie else then to him.

            <p>The, <hi>Volacchi,</hi> and the <hi>Capigi,</hi> which were sent from the king, were now come to <hi>Osman,</hi> who readily had put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe on his way towardes <hi>Constantinople,</hi> hauing left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind <note place="margin">Osman depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from Derbent, and leaueth two Bassaes in it and at Suma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia.</note> him at <hi>Derbent,</hi> and at <hi>Sumachia</hi> two <hi>Bassaes,</hi> which he thought to bee the most sufficient men and the best of all those that were in <hi>Siruania:</hi> hauing also appointed verie good orders in the same, and an assured establishment of all those Countries and places, which <hi>Mustaffa</hi> first had subdued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hee himselfe afterward had mainteined and kept vnder the obedience of <hi>Amurath.</hi> Hee had also made

            <p>By reason of one of the letters, which <hi>Sciaus Bassa</hi> had <note place="margin">A letter of Sciaus that was found is the cause why hee was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed from his chiefe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siership.</note> written to the <hi>Cuman Tartar,</hi> and was founde I know not howe, <hi>Amurath</hi> had depriued the saide <hi>Sciaus</hi> from the office of the chiefe <hi>Visier,</hi> and banished him from the Courte, so that hee liued afterwardes about <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedone,</hi> vpon the borders of <hi>Asia</hi> towardes <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in a certaine <hi>Serraglio</hi> or close Palace, that yee had
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:23114:145"/>
there builte for his owne pleasure and recreation. And in the rowme of this his son in law, he had appointed <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to bee chiefe <hi>Visier</hi> in the ranke of the <hi>Bassaes</hi> of the <note place="margin">Osman Bassa chiefe Visier,</note> Court: and not contented to haue committed so great a trust vnto him, hee nominated him also the Generall and Soueraigne Captaine in the enterprise of <hi>Tauris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such power and force hath vertue, that euen from the verie skomme of the rascall sorte, and out of the rustical route of <hi>Mountaine Peasauntes</hi> (which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing cannot bee truely iustified of this <hi>Osman)</hi> it doth oftentimes in this variable worlde drawe diuerse men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Princes Courtes, and aduaunce them to the highest dignities. This <hi>Osmans</hi> father was a <hi>Circassian</hi> borne, who in the common losse and conquest of his countrey, was one of those, that to escape the slaughtering sworde <note place="margin">The ofspring of Osman Bassa.</note> of <hi>Selim,</hi> submitted themselues to the <hi>Turkish</hi> yoke, and afterwardes fighting in defense thereof, hee ouercame the <hi>Aethtopians,</hi> and thereby obtained immortall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme. Of these his vertues hee lefte the saide <hi>Osman</hi> his heire, who beeing broughte vppe in aboundance of all thinges, and trayned vp in the Arte of warrefare, became verie couragious and skilfull therein: and at last, from a priuate Souldier was called to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est dignities of so greate an Empyre, and from thence to the chiefest place of authoritie in the Armie of the Easte, and to bee shorte, was at one instante crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Counseller and Generall of <hi>Ottoman.</hi> Greate was the ioye that <hi>Osman</hi> conceiued hereat, and greate <note place="margin">Osman cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen General of the Armie to goe to Tauris.</note> was the desire that hee had to make himselfe woorthie of so honourable fauours: and the greater confidence that hee perceiued <hi>Amarath</hi> had reposed in him, the more eagerly was he spurred on to doe any thing possible
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:23114:146"/>
whereby hee might shewe himselfe to haue deserued the same. And therefore aduising with himselfe, that foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there must bee a greater Armie nowe Leuied, then there was in the former years, &amp; so sent into very far Countreyes, it was also necessarie for him the sooner to send out his aduertisementes into all his subiect <hi>Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and he himselfe by his owne example to prouoke the other Captaines and Souldiers therunto, he determined euen in winter (thought it were as yet somewhat trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,) to passe to <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Angori,</hi> to <hi>Amasia,</hi> to <hi>Siuas,</hi> and in those territories to driue out the <note place="margin">The diligence of Osman Bassa.</note> time, vntill hee might vnderstand, that all his souldiers, which were summoned were gathered together. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause vpon this his great speed, it might fal out peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that his enemies also woulde beginne to prepare a greater number of Souldiers, if they should vnderstande for certaine, that <hi>Osman</hi> had appointed all these prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for <hi>Tauris:</hi> he thought it a better pollicie (for so it pleased <hi>Amurath</hi> also: to spreade a rumour abroade, that <note place="margin">A fained ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Nassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uan.</note> they must goe for <hi>Nassiuan,</hi> whither <hi>Ferat Bassa</hi> had giuen out speech that he should haue gone the last yeere before: to the end that the <hi>Persians,</hi> beeing so beguiled, shoulde not regard the gathering of so mighty an Armye, as they woulde haue done, if they should haue heard of their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to <hi>Tauris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so this Generall cosening Rumour touching <hi>Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuan,</hi> was published abroad, not onely through all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties subiect to the Turk, but the fame therof flew also euen <note place="margin">The Persian iealous of Tauris.</note> into the Countries of the <hi>Persians,</hi> who notwithstanding beeing very iealous of the Citie of <hi>Tauris,</hi> and fearing that the matter would fall out, as indeed afterwardes it did, ceased not to make curious &amp; diligent enquiry about
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:23114:146"/>
it. And although the indignitie and disgrace, that was offered to his Embassadour, dissuaded him from sending any other for treaty of peace, yet to spie out the secretes of the Turkes, and to vnderstande certainely whether their intent were to passe to <hi>Nassiuan</hi> or to <hi>Tauris,</hi> hee coulde doe no lesse but dispatch diuers <hi>Chiaus</hi> or Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to <hi>Osman,</hi> and by making a shewe that he ment in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deed to feele his minde touching conditions of peace, to try whether he could learne and discouer the trueth or <note place="margin">The Persian cannot come to any certen knowledge of the designe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bassa.</note> no. But by all the meanes, and by all the cunning that he could possibly vse, he could neuer find out any certaine knowledge thereof: so that there still remained in him many doubtfull and confused cogitations, which were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered and fostered by some carelesse and simple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, that <hi>Osman</hi> had giuen out speeche for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of <hi>Nassiuan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And nowe according to the commandement gone out through all the Cities of the Empire, the Souldiers of all sortes beganne to flocke together: and all those that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were desirous to be established in their former char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and gouernementes of Cities, or sought ambitiously to bee honoured with some Office and dignitie, made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire <note place="margin">Osman ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a huge treasure by presents.</note> vnto him as vnto a king and Soueraigne moderator of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, presenting him with very large &amp; liberal guiftes. Wherby his estate was so greatly enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that through these meanes he had gathered together a huge heape of infinite treasure. And so entertaining them with all affable curtesie, and also with promising both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes and honours to all that woulde followe him in his purposed voiage, he leauied a wonderful great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men and Moneyes. But nowe was the time come, that called him away to goe towardes <hi>Erzirum,</hi>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:23114:147"/>
where hee was greatlye expected by his huge armie there assembled together, &amp; notwithstanding the great dearth <note place="margin">

In the saide citie of <hi>Erzirum</hi> were mette together all the souldiers of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces that were woont to send helpe, but yet in a greater number, then euer was gathered by any Generall before, for that euerie man forsooke and abandoned his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate busines, &amp; vpon assured hopes of new rewards &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted honors, they were al induced to follow the fame of, their newe <hi>Visier.</hi> Onelie the people of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masco</hi> were busied with other more priuate Quarels, wher of because they are both of great importance, and also fel out at this verie instant, it wil not be amisse to make some briefe rehearsal, for a manifest, and euident example heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, how great harme and mischiefe the diuersitie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and dissension of neighbours doth breed among all sortes of men.</p>

of his traine without.

            <p>The politike and crafty <hi>Eunuch</hi> had in this mean time dispatched diuers postes with letters to the Sultan La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, certifieng them of his comming, and principally beseeching the Queene, to protect him, and to purg the kings minde from all affection of anger and in dignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he might haue conceiued against him: and so he arriued at <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Assoone as the king vnderstood of his arriuall, hee caused all the treasure which he had <note place="margin">The Eunuch at Chalcedon</note> gathered, to bee taken from him, withall the rest of his priuate substance, and the same to be carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the great store house, and himselfe to bee shutte vppe in prison within the seauen Toweres: Where after hee hadde woorne out many daies, wherein hee still feared some deadlie blowe, hee receiued from the Queene an vnexpected aduertisement, that hee shoulde bee of good cheere, and quiet himselfe for that his wealth had alreadie excused his life, and

that shee hoped in verie shorte time to gette him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored also to his libertie: which indeed she brought to passe.

            <p>The <hi>Drusians</hi> are by Nation and Ofspring, French-men, the Reliques of those, that with deuoute mindes <note place="margin">The Drusian people, what they are.</note> did in times past fight those memorable and Christian battels in <hi>Iurie,</hi> and recouered the holie Sepulchre of

               <hi>Ebnefrec, Ebnecarfus</hi> and <hi>Ebnemansur,</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies great friends, but now especially at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Ebrain Bassa,</hi> they shewed themselues, more straitly confederated together: <hi>Serafadin</hi> and <hi>Manogli</hi> were euer opposite against them: so that the one side procuring the ouerthrowe and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe of the other; they haue vtterlye loste their strength, and haue no meanes left them to defend themselues from the <hi>Ottoman</hi> forces.

            <p>Vpon the hill aforesaid, the Visier continued foure &amp; twentie daies together, with aboundance of all thinges necessary for victuaill: during all which tyme he atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing els, but to trye all deuises, how hee might draw money and presentes from <hi>Ebne-Man,</hi> or how hee might traine him into his handes.

For the Sultans pleasure was, that his people which went not to the wars

With great griefe of mind did <hi>Ebne-Man</hi> behold the said <hi>Gomeda,</hi> as the man whom hee well knew to be the Factor of his deadly enemy, but yet durst not in any sort doo him anie iniury, nor giue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reproach. But when he heard the demand for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubuses, he aunswered him, that all his people and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons were dispersed abrode ouer his Territorie, so that hee could not tell what Arcubuses to send him.

Many reasons did <hi>Aly Bassa</hi> vse, to perswade the wary <hi>Drusian,</hi> that hee would come and yeeld his obedience to <hi>Ebrain,</hi> swearing that no manner of outrage should be doone vnto him, &amp; promising him great and honorable fauours.

               </gap>ne, so that she returned to <hi>Ebrain</hi> an aunswere not greatly pleasing him, and therefore hee licenced her to depart.</p>
            <p>After which time, he sought more then euer he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to get the stubburne <hi>Emir</hi> into his hands, or at least to draw from him more presents and weapons, without regard of any shame, thinking euery thing lawfull that came into his mind, whatsoeuer. And therefore once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <note place="margin">Gomeda re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to Manogli.</note> he sent the craftie and malignant <hi>Gomeda,</hi> to exhort him, that vpon the faith and promise which he had geuen him, he would come vnto him. But for all the craftie and lying speeches, that the treacherous messenger could cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly vse, he could obtaine nothing at his handes, but words onely. Which when he perceaued, and yet not minded to returne altogether in vaine, and without any profit, by the appointment of <hi>Ebrain</hi> himself, he told him, that forasmuch as he was not willing to go, yet he should be contented at least, in his presence to peruse the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts of those Monopolies, that he had managed for the King in times past, to the end that if they should be found to be paied and discharged, then he should rid the Turkish Captain from those mountaines, and so remayn in quiet. <hi>Manogli</hi> vnderstanding this fraudulent request, which in the end tended to no other purpose, but onely to get some money, &amp; some presents, determined therein to satisfie <hi>Gomeda,</hi> with an expresse condition notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that he should cause <hi>Ebrain</hi> to depart out of those quarters, and that he should not returne any more to request any thing of him. Which he verie largely and liberally promised, onely desiring him, that because he
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:23114:161"/>
should not haue any occasion to send againe any others vnto him, hee would also giue him a good quantitie of Arcubuses, and thereby make the <hi>Visier</hi> fully contented and well appaied. And so he gaue him fiftie thousand <note place="margin">A new present of Ebne-Man to Ebrain.</note> Duckets more, and fower hundred and fower score Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubuses, with a thousand Goates, a hundred and fiftie Camels, a hundred and fifty Buffes, a thousand Oxen, and two hundred Weathers. With this rich and honorable present came <hi>Gomeda</hi> to <hi>Ebrain,</hi> and declared vnto him, that this he had gotten from him, vpon promise that he should not molest the <hi>Drusian</hi> any more. For which the <hi>Visier</hi> did greatly reproue <hi>Gomeda,</hi> telling him that if he <note place="margin">Ebrain repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Gomeda</note> did not shew himselfe a more diligent and faithfull exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of his commaundements, he would not be well pleased with him, and that he would make euery man know, what a weightie matter it is for men to take vpon them so inordinate, and so dangerous a libertie. And for the greater despight both to the one and the other of them, <hi>Ebrain</hi> would needes haue <hi>Gomeda</hi> himselfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe to trouble the <hi>Drusian.</hi> Wherunto although he went in great feare, least some great mischiefe might happen to him by the hands of <hi>Manogli,</hi> yet was there no remedy, but needes he must follow the commaund of him, who was able to take from him both his honor, and his life. And therefore to auoid the greater danger, and to pleasure him, he made no great scruple to belie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and to become infamous in the sight of the <hi>Drusian.</hi> As soon as <hi>Manogli</hi> saw <hi>Gomeda,</hi> thinking with himselfe <note place="margin">Gomeda a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain goeth to Manogli.</note> that he came to him again about his wonted requests, he was greatly troubled in his minde, and had almost pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nented his arriuall with a dart, which the angry <hi>Drusian</hi> was minded, and euen at the verie point to throw at him,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:23114:161"/>
for the great desire he had to rid him out of his sight but that refraining his anger, least it might peraduenture haue bred more dangerous effectes, he quenched his choler with ignominious wordes and deadly threats: protesting at last, that the time would come, wherin he would reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at his hands, whatsoeuer he had now taken from him by the meanes of so wrongfull and so wicked a treacherie. Notwithstanding <hi>Gomeda</hi> could do no lesse but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the effect of his fraudulent requests, and so wrought with him in deed, that he drew from the <hi>Emir,</hi> fower bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens <note place="margin">The new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neman sedet to Ebrain.</note> more of Arcubuses, tenne swordes, and tenne guylt Gangiares or daggers, certain siluer beltes, tenne packes of silk, and some few pence: Causing him withall to protest vnto him, that he would neuer suffer himselfe to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to come again vnto him: for if he did, he should be enforced to depriue him of his life, happen afterward what might happen of it.</p>
            <p>With extreame ioy and triumph did <hi>Ebrain</hi> the Visier see all this present, and thinking now with himself, that he had gotten a sufficient bootie of him, he determined to raise his Armie, &amp; to sack all the rest of the Countrey that was subiect to <hi>Manogli,</hi> not leauing any part of it sound of vntouched. And therefore sending certain fore-runners before him to discouer the Countrey, &amp; to prouide some commodious place to pytch his Tentes, (the Captain of whom was the <hi>Emir-Ebnefrec,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Acra</hi> the <hi>Scuruie)</hi> he raysed his Campe, and marched on the other side of the Mountain: and passing by <hi>Andera,</hi> which was the place of residence where <hi>Manogli</hi> remained, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded <note place="margin">Andera sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</note> that it should be sacked and burnt: which was put in execution accordingly, with vnspeakable effects of cruelty, committing all things to fier &amp; sword. After this,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:23114:162"/>
the Turkes ouerran all the Countrey, and in two dayes space burnt &amp; destroyed nineteen Townes besides, cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away with them whatsoeuer they could find worthie <note place="margin">19. Townes burnt.</note> of spoyle.</p>
            <p>After all this sacking and rasing, the <hi>Visier</hi> with all his Armie mounted vp to the large top of a Mountain, which was also neere to <hi>Andara,</hi> and from thence sent a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand messe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers to <hi>Ebne-Man,</hi> to trie whether he would yet be perswaded to come vnto him. But neither all these siers, nor all their entreaties, nor their terrifying, nor their myldnesse could euer moue <hi>Manogli</hi> to commit himself into his hands, but still more stoutely and constantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to auoyde most certain death. And therefore the <hi>Visier,</hi> not contented to haue burned and destroied the Countrey, to haue drawen so much treasure from the <hi>Drusian,</hi> and to haue plotted so many treacheries against him, bethought himselfe in the end to satisfie his inward affection to crueltie and reuenge, with the slaughter of his miserable people. And hauing vnderstood by a Spie, that the Captain of <hi>Andara,</hi> being one of the Factors of <note place="margin">Ebnefrec or Feracogli go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to inuite the Macade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nogli.</note> 
               <hi>Manogli,</hi> with three hundred and fiftie persons was ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp to a certain hill into a safe and secure place, he sent <hi>Ebnefrec</hi> to entice him, &amp; to tell him, that seeing his <hi>Emir Manogli</hi> would not come and yeeld himselfe, he should come vnto him, and assuredly, if he did so, in despite of <hi>Manogli</hi> he would make him a <hi>Sangiacco</hi> of some of those places, which hee most desired. The ambitious and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heedy <hi>Macademo</hi> suffered himselfe to bee easely perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with this most malicious lie, and being accompanied with his three hundred and fiftie followers, went with the said <hi>Ebnefrec</hi> towardes the Visier. And beecause the voice was giuen out, that there were no moe Arcubuses
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:23114:162"/>
in all the Countrey of <hi>Manogli,</hi> the <hi>Macademo</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded all his men, that laying aside their Arcubuses, they should arme themselues onely with their swordes, and their bowes; And so going before them, walking still on the right side of the <hi>Emir Aora,</hi> thereby to giue him his due honor. (For it is the custome of the <hi>Mahometanes,</hi>

At the last he arriued at the Pauilion of <hi>Ebrain,</hi> hauing first caused his foresaid men to stay behind in a certain valley, two or three miles distant from the Tentes. <hi>Ebrain</hi> would not so much as see the <hi>Macademo,</hi> although both in respect of the nimhlenes of his person, and also the fiercenesse of his lookes, he was worthy to be seen, but commaunded that he should be safely kept in a seuerall place from <hi>Serafadin:</hi> and in the mean time hauing called to counsell the <hi>Emirs,</hi> and <hi>Aly</hi> the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> to deuise some wyle, whereby they might put to death those three hundred and fiftie, wyth as little losse of their owne souldiers as possibly might be, it was concluded, that the foresaid <hi>Ebnefrec</hi> should leade them into a certain Vineyard, and afterwards at vnwares set vpon them, and hauing so brought them to a straite, hew them in peeces, and cut them off: for hauing no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubuses, they could work but small hurt to his souldiers. <hi>Acra</hi> went like a common butcher, and conducted the <note place="margin">Acra like a common hangman.</note> poore wretches into the appointed vineyard and while they waited for their Captaine, and expected some great reward, because they had so confidently beleeued their

promises, they were sodeinly enuironed with the Armie of <hi>Ebrain,</hi> the <hi>Sangiacchi</hi> making a wing on the one side, and the <hi>Iannizzaries</hi> on the other: who beeing become greedie of the blood of those miserable soules, hauing brought them into a narrow compasse, fell vpon them with their Arcubuses and their speares, and suffering not <note place="margin">The 350. soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Macademo, slaine.</note> one of them to escape, most cruelly slew them all. The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie wretches defended themselues the best they could, with their arrowes, with their swordes, with their hands, and with their bodies, but all to no purpose, for they were all destroied in this common and miserable slaughter.

For I do not think that any of you all, either had bin hable or durst, man to man, to draw one drop of my blood from me, no not to haue endured my countenance. But go to, proceed in your wicked and vnsatiable desire, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the impious commaundements of your Visier: for in the end there will light also vpon you, the worthy punishment of this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous fact.</hi>

And then the barbarous souldiers, pursuing their cruell action, made certaine other gashes vpon his brest, and vpon his stomake, and so drawing his skinne downeward, they could not bring it to his Nauel, before he was dead, with most dolorous paines.</p>
            <p>After this, the <hi>Visier</hi> caused <hi>Ebne Serafadin</hi> to be called into his pauilion, who (as we told you before) was by his commandement deliuered into the custodie of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>Iannizzaries</hi> of the Court, and gaue charge withall, that whiles <hi>Serafadin</hi> was in his Tent with him, all his men, that came with him, should be put to death. According to his appointment it was done, and when <hi>Serafadin</hi> was brought before the <hi>Visier,</hi> all his souldiers, which might be about a hundred &amp; fiftie, were miserably
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:23114:164"/>
hewen in peeces, and order giuen that <hi>Serafadin</hi> should be returned againe to his chaynes, and all his Countrey wasted and spoyled. This commaundement all the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers <note place="margin">The countrie of Serafadin wasted.</note> were readie enough to put in execution, and besides the booties that they took, they brought away also a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fower score heades of the people that were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the said <hi>Emir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whiles this wasting by fier, &amp; this slaughter by sword was in hand, the <hi>Visier</hi> dispatched Postes to <hi>Sidonia,</hi> where the forenamed Gallies were at road, by whom he sent commaundement, that disbarking iiij<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thousand souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <note place="margin">The souldiers of the Gallies sack the Sea coast of the Drusians.</note> they should sack all those Countries, euen as farre as <hi>Caesarea</hi> in <hi>Palaestine,</hi> sparing neither age, nor sexe, nor any condition of persons whatsoeuer. Which likewise was presently done, and three thousand soules brought cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, great booties made of diuerse rich marchandizes, many Townes burnt, sundry Castels ruynated and made euen with the ground, and to be short, all the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of <hi>Serafadin</hi> and <hi>Manogli</hi> vtterly desolated. But <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fadin</hi> himself was afterward sent to <hi>Damasco,</hi> with all his wealth, money, and presents, vnder the gard and custodie of <hi>Bassa Veis,</hi> and <hi>Bassa Aly:</hi> who brought all things thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther safe and sound, and so from thence to <hi>Tripoli,</hi> where on a certain plain betweene the land and the sea, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped themselues, and stayed there, waiting for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riual of the <hi>Visier</hi> with his Gallies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ebrain</hi> the <hi>Visier,</hi> was now in a readinesse to depart and to returne to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he was expected by the King, aswell for the greedinesse of his gold, as for the accomplishment of the Mariage. But bethinking himself, that whatsoeuer hither to he had don, would be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either little or nothing, vnlesse he prouided in some

sort for the quiet of those peoples vnder the Turkish obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he determined to nominate one of the three <hi>Emirs,</hi> that accompanied him to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to bee the <hi>Bassa</hi> of all those regions. Now the <hi>Emir Aly Ebnecarfus</hi> being the richest and the most obedient of them all, hee thought good to commit that charge vnto him, &amp; honoured him with that dignity.

               </note> which the <hi>Emir Aly</hi> presently paid vnto him, to make him seeme the more worthie of so great an honour. And therefore hee apparrelled him in cloth of gold, hee gaue him a mase and a sword all guilt, and deliuered vnto him the kinges commission, causing him withall to sweare faith and obedience to <hi>Amurath.</hi> And so hauing (at least to the shew) set in order the affayres of those moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, he determined to returne to <hi>Damasco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There he continued for the space of twelue daies, where he ceased not to draw money &amp; bribes from diuers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, by most vnreasonable shiftes: and at last hauing no furder to doo in those partes, he turned himselfe towards <hi>Gazir</hi> and <hi>Baruto,</hi> two places vnder the gouernement of <note place="margin">Ebrain at Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zir and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruto.</note>

Now vpon a certaine hill aboue <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruto,</hi> neere vnto the sea (called by the inhabitants <hi>San Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro)</hi> he placed himselfe, and pitched his owne Tent one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and none other, hauing caused his great pauilion, &amp; all the rest of his best and goodly thinges, which he ment to carrie with him to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to bee conueighed and laide vp in his Gallies, and shrowded himselfe onely in a very narrow and base tent. Thether he called <hi>Ebneman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur</hi>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:23114:165"/>
vnto him, and in pleasant manner signified vnto him, that now it was time for him to make paiment and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the debt, which he ought the king his Lord, of a hundred and three score thousand duckattes for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of <hi>Tripoli</hi> and <hi>Baruto:</hi> for that he could not stay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer in those quarters, but was constrained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to <hi>Constantinople:</hi> and thether he knew not how he might well go, vnlesse he carried with him the discharge of that debt. <hi>Ebne-Mansur</hi> made aunswere that it could not be long, before his Macademies would come with his monies, and then the next day after, certainely and without all delay he would disburse it. <hi>Ebrain</hi> who knew that all this was but a lye, determined to cause him to bee put in the Gallies, and because hee could not carry the money to his king, yet at the least to bring him his deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. But in putting this his determination to effect and execution, he was affraide, of some insurrection among the people, aswell because he was within the territories of the said <hi>Ebne-Mansur,</hi> as also because he saw him great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued and fauoured by <hi>Ebne-Frec</hi> and <hi>Ebne-Carfus.</hi> And therefore he thought it better policy, by concealing this his purpose, to shew him in his outward actions all good countenaunce, and by subtile deuises and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to take him prisoner. And thereupon told him, (like a deceitfull and lying companion) that for asmuch as hee <note place="margin">Ebrain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guileth Mansurogli.</note> was to stay there for his busines, that night and the next day, he was resolued to make a road into the countrey of <hi>Manogli,</hi> and praied him to doo him the fauour, that he would be contented to be his guide: and for that purpose when he should send for him at midnight, that he wold come vnto him closely &amp; quietly, because he was mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to depart without any stirre, onely with fiue hundred
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:23114:165"/>
persons in his company. The Mahamet verily beleeued the matter, that so it was, and withall was in good hope by that meanes to finde some way to escape out of his hands.

The occasion whereof was, not onely the multitude of warrants sent abroad through all the subiect Cities, but also the affection that euery man did beare to the fame and renowme of <hi>Osman,</hi> vnto whom, aswell for his valour, whereof all men caried a good opinion, as also for his soueraigne aucthoritie, whereby he ruled as <hi>Chiefe Visier,</hi> but especially for the confidence, which (was well knowen) the King reposed in him, they all ran by heapes with most willing minds: And he wisely cherishing and <note place="margin">Osman enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth al that come.</note> fostering them in their good forwardnesse, entertayned them all with faire promises, and hope of rewardes.

could not tel with what iudgment or discretion he meant to lead so great a companie so farre as <hi>Nassiuan,</hi> nor by what cunning conceit he had presumed to sustain so great an Armie in the seruice of their Lord. <hi>Osman</hi> quietly <note place="margin">Osman myld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pacifieth the souldiers that were in a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie.</note> heard their complaints, and presently prouided for them, by causing such store of Barley to be distributed among them all as they desired, and seuerely punishing the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, that had the charge for allowance of Corne, who most couetously began to make merchandise of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prouision, by conuerting it to their owne priuate vses.

            <p>
               <hi>Osman</hi> had intelligence of this discomfiture, &amp; fourth-with caused his Armie to be raised, and dispatched <hi>Sinan</hi>

Assoone as the Prince saw the Turkes so neere him, and knew that without a daungerous and shamfull flight, hee could not auoid the battell, couragiously hee tourned his face vpon them, and ioyned a most bloody conflict with them.

It is a common speech that in this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond battell, (which notwithstanding together with the first exploitis reckoned but for one onely) there wanted <note place="margin">6000.

            <p>The next morning the Turkish Campe remoued, and <note place="margin">Aliculy-Chan assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kesh army, whiles they were encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</note> approched within two miles of <hi>Tauris</hi> where they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped.

And when he had so doone, without any stay hee fled to the Kinges Campe, and forsooke the defence of the sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Citty.

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:23114:174"/>
they came. All the whole night was spent in watching both on the one side and on the other, neither could the flattering entisement of sleeep procure any quiet or rest to the poore soules either of the Cittizens or of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and yet there was no motion of war on either side. But vpon the breake of day, a great bande of the seruile sort of Turkes, and of the rascall common rout, without <note place="margin">The seruile people first go to the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to sack it.</note> any leaue asked of the Captain, armed with corslets, with speares and with swordes, went to the towne, with reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute mindes to sacke it, and to enrich their owne priuate estate with the spoiles and pillage of that welthie Citty. And now were they come to the guarded gates, where contrary to their expectation they found a terrible rescue, <note place="margin">Slaughter in the gates.</note> and were enforced to ioyne a hard and mortall medley, wherein the walles, the entrance, yea all the ground there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about was bathed with blood, &amp; (as it were) paued with weapons and carcases. And yet for all that, though the Persians stood firme &amp; stout at the arriuall of this insolent and seruile troupe, at the last they were constrained to yeeld the entrance, being ouercome by the multitude of them, that flowed in vpon them lyke a floud, and retiring <note place="margin">The Taurisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans yeeld the gates to the Turkish peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le.</note> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues into the cittie, which was now astonied &amp; ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on euery side, they fortified themselues in their houses vnder the grounde, and in the corners and winding tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges of the streetes: from whence, by their arrowes, &amp; some few Arcubuscs, they did great scath to the Turkes <note place="margin">The Taurisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans fortifie themselues in their vaultes, and in the corners of their streets.</note> that entred. Howbet the Persians were not able to kill &amp; destroy so many of their enimy people, but that at the last they were too mighty for them, and wrought many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous mischiefes and calamities in the wofull Citty. And so a great nomber of this rascall people, which remayned aliue, returned to the Turkish Campe, enriched with
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:23114:174"/>
booties and slaues, leading away with them both virgins <note place="margin">The Turkes returne to the Campe with diuers praies and booties.</note> and children, and shewing too manifest tokens of the poore oppressed Citty, wherein the miserable wemen &amp; impotent soules embracing and strayning their domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call doores, and kissing their natiue soyle, with prayers, with mourninges, with complaints, bewayled their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent misery, and feared also worse &amp; more deadly euents. <hi>Osman,</hi> who was now made acquainted with these cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and with this particular misaduenture, caused pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to be published, that no man should be so har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as to molest the <hi>Taurisians,</hi> those I meane, which were naturally there borne: and in the meane time he himselfe <note place="margin">Osman view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the place where to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and build a forte.</note> went round about the saide Citty, viewing thoroughly the situation of it, and surueighing the place, wherein he might both incampe himselfe safely, and also with the better foundation and greater security erect a Castell or Forte of defence of that conquered countrey.</p>

It hath a great number of houses vnder the ground: The buyldinges, after the fashion of those that are buylt in the East, are of burnt clay, &amp; rather low then high. It hath Springs, Gardens, and running waters. And for all things it caried the name, as also of their Kings resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. <hi>Tamas</hi> was the man that remoued his seat from this Citie, and translated it to <hi>Casbin:</hi> but still for all that, both before and sithence, although it hath bene molested by the inroades and spoyles of the <hi>Turkish Emperours,</hi> yet it hath alwayes maintayned it selfe in great estimation and renowme.</p>
            <p>Now of this Citty, <hi>Osman</hi> did diligently view the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, and at the last caused his Pauilions to be pitched <note place="margin">The tentes pitched on the south side.</note> vpon the side that looketh towardes the South, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that all the rest of this Souldiers should do the like, &amp; that all the Workemen and Ditchers should repaire the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to beginne the building of a Castell.

There were a thousand Fountaines, and a thousand brookes, &amp; among them all, as the Father of them all, a prettie Riuer, which with his milde course and delight some noyse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided the Garden from the ground of <hi>Tauris,</hi> and one onely bridge for those to passe ouer it, which for pleasure repayred out of <hi>Tauris</hi> to recreate themselues in the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and walkes of those greenes: whose beauty was so

great, being also made famous by reason of antiquity, that it was also called by the countrey Inhabitantes <hi>Sechis-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> which in our language is as much to say, as <hi>Eight Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radises.</hi>

Fiue daies after the buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Fort was begon, there came newes into the Turkish campe, that within the Citie of <hi>Tauris,</hi> in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain baine, there were eight Iannizzaries, and diuerse Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oglanj seen strangled: wherof the <hi>Zaini, Spahini,</hi> and Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizzaries <note place="margin">Turkes stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in a bath within Tauris</note> being certified, went presently before the <hi>Visier,</hi> declaring vnto him, that although hee had ouer mildlie giuen order, that the <hi>Taurisians</hi> should not be molested or hurt, and that according to his pleasure, euery man had vsed modestie towards them, and obedience to him, yet the <hi>Taurisians</hi> themselues, who should haue remayned in quiet and in awe, had most audaciously strangled in one of their baynes eight Iannizzaries, and certain Spao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glanj, and that in their iudgement these iniuries and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies were not to be suffered. The Captain was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wroth at this most cruell and impious action, and without any further delay commaunded, that the whole <note place="margin">Osman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth that the Citie of Tauris should be sacked in the vilest ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> Citie should be sacked, and that euery man should do the worst, that possibly he could, or might do to it. Heere a man had need of a verie learned and eloquent penne, to describe the fierce and cruel execution of these men, who handled the matter, not as though they would requite an iniurie, but rather exercise an vtter vengeance vpon them, insomuch, as it would require great force of witt, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse of toung to declare it.

Neither were these mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes committed once onely, but the second followed worse then the first, and the third vpon that, worse then the second: so that it was a miserie almost vnexplicable, to behold that Citie, which was so populous and so riche, <note place="margin">The misery of the Citie of Tauris.</note> sometimes the Court and Palace of the Crowne, and the honor of the Persian Empire, now subiect to the furie, to the rauine, to the crueltie of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> plonged in cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and vtterly destroied.

            <p>The lamentable and sorowfull aduertisement hereof was brought to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who bewayled the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie of himselfe, and the destruction of others: But the Persian prince beyond all the rest felt rising inwardly within himself the most ardent affections of griefe, of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and of desperation, &amp; being vtterly resolued to put any thing in execution, whereby he might be reuenged of so great a crueltie, and recouer the pray that was taken <note place="margin">The Persian Prince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth 500. souldiers, to go and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the Turkes to fight.</note> away, he exhorted his whole Armie to put on the same resolution. And hauing grounded and confirmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe therein, he commaunded, that fiue hundred of his souldiers should ryde out on hors-back, euen to the verie

These souldiers so appointed went accordingly, and made a gallant show of themselues, at the discouery wherof, the <hi>Turks</hi> imagining, that the <hi>Persians</hi> were come in great number to assault their Armie: Order was giuen by the <hi>Visier</hi> to <hi>Bassa Cicala,</hi> and the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Caraemit,</hi> (the <note place="margin">Osman ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth two Bassaes, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter and fight with the Persians.</note> same two which were at first in the former blouddie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,) that with the people of <hi>Grecia,</hi> and all the rest of their whole power, they should go to encounter the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.

The fiue hundred Persians, with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous cunning kind of skirmishing, dallied with the Turkish souldiers, and drew them forward, for the space of eight miles and more. And when they were brought to that point, being now fore-wearied with the skirmish, they were lustely assaulted by the <hi>Persian Prince,</hi> who with part of his Armie, which might be to the number of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twentie thousand persons, couragiously &amp; valiantly seised vpon the two <hi>Bassaes,</hi> betweene whom there was ioyned the deadliest and cruellest battell, that euer was written of. Wherein the <hi>Persians</hi> hauing giuen a most <note place="margin">A mortal and cruel battell.</note> perillous onset vpon the Turkes, it was thought, that they would haue been contented with so luckie an encounter, and so to haue retyred.

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:23114:177"/>
vpon the <hi>Persians,</hi> hoping to put them to flight, and to giue them a blouddie and deadlie ouerthrow: But the <hi>Persians</hi> hauing quietly and easilie endured their charge, for a reasonable space, at the last made head vpon them a fresh, and began a new conflict with them. By the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of this assault, the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Caraemit</hi> aboue named, was put to flight, who beeing wholie dismaied and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited, <note place="margin">The Bassa of Caraemit put to flight.</note> fled back to his Tentes, with a manifest token of the vnhappie issue in the battell. The <hi>Bassa Cicala</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, sustained the furie of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorously with great cunning &amp; skill went about to harten the Armie to fight, and to doo their best endeauours, shewing his notable courage in euery respect. But when he perceaued that in both the winges of his people there was still great harme done in euery moment of an hower, he aduised with himselfe to retyre with the least danger that possibly he might. Wherein he could not so warily <note place="margin">Cicala Bassa flyeth also.</note> carie himself, but that his Squadrons were shrewdlie bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and discomfited, and in the end, he was enforced in the sight of euery man to with-draw himselfe to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and openly betake himself to flight. So that he also arriued at the campe, altogether discomfited, without any Ensigne, bereaued of three yong men, whom he loued verie deerely, and without any of his horses which he had caused to be lead with him, to haue serued his turne in time of neede: and so speak all in a woord, he was quite ouerthrowen, and (about) eight thousand of his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <note place="margin">8000. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:23114:178"/>
With this so fortunate and happie euent, the <hi>Persian Prince</hi> being somewhat encouraged, he sent speedie He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauldes <note place="margin">Heraulds sent by the Persian Prince to Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> to the sick <hi>Visier,</hi> (whom he thought notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to haue been in health) giuing him to vnderstand, that if it pleased him to fight with him, he was readie for him, and in what sort soeuer he would accept of battell, he would make him good accompt of his valour, &amp; cause him to know, not onely that <hi>Amurath</hi> had most iniurious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and vniustly raised this warre, but also that it had been good for him not to haue withstood his force and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. <hi>Osman</hi> accepted his offer, but being not hable him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to go and aunswer the <hi>Prince</hi> in person, hand to hand, <note place="margin">Osman accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the offer, but his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth mortally vpon him.</note> by reason of his sicknesse, which euery hower encreased more mortally vpon him, he sent out all the Captaines of his armie.

            <p>Being thus ordered and deuided, they confronted the Persian Prince, who was himselfe in the middest of his <note place="margin">The order of the Persians.</note> Army, and had placed all his people in very good order on all sides, hauing on his one side, the souldiers of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Hircania,</hi> and on his other side the souldiers of <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a</hi> and <hi>Atropatia,</hi> in all to the nomber of forty thousand.

Whereof they had such speciall care, that retiring themselues asmuch as they might, and faining that they yeelded and gaue place to the Persians, they withdrew so neere to their Army, that they wanted but a little from being brought euen within the iust leuill and marke of their artillarie.

            <p>But now there were many daies spent, wherein (as we told you afore) the fabricke of the Fortresse was fully finished.

And the rather to encourage him that he would take the charge vppon him, he gaue him freely, for the space of three whole yeares, not onely the office and authority, but also the rentes and reuenues of the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Caraemit,</hi> in the place of him, whose head (we told you lately) the Persian Prince had cut of: and withall honoured him with the title of the <hi>Bassa</hi> of the Court, where hauing finished his three yeares office of <hi>Caraemit,</hi> he was to go &amp; sit among the soueraigne seates in the order and ranke of the Visiers.

But while the Turks were thus intentiuely busied on that side, to expect the arriuall of their enemies, on the other side without any signe or token of battell was the Persian Prince ready vpon them with eight &amp; twenty thousande <note place="margin">The Persian Prince assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Turkes, with 28000. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> persons in his company, who, (hauing discouered the Camelles, the horses, the Mules, &amp; other cariages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon their booties, their spoiles, and their riches were loaden which they had taken in <hi>Tauris,</hi> besides their corne and much of their prouision for victuaile, necessarie for the sustenaunce of the armie,) had turned vpon them, &amp; with a prouident and safe conuoy had taken for a praye eighteene thousand of the Cammelles and Mules, well <note place="margin">18000.

It was a gallant thing, &amp; a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble withall, to see what a mortall battell and what singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar prowesse was shewed, presently euen in the forefront of the army.

But these mischeefes being already foreseene and too much feared by the trusty guard of the <hi>Ianizzaries,</hi> &amp; all of them doubting greatly least the Persians would forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inuade the very lodginges of the Visier, it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, not by himself, (for he was now at the last gasp) <note place="margin">The Visier at the last gaspe.</note> but by him who at that time had authority to command in his name, that without any delay the artillary should be vnbarred, &amp; by that means the valorous conflict of these fierce souldiers was vnequally parted. For the Artillary wrought perchance greatter harme among the Turkes <note place="margin">The artillary workeh hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely more harme among the Turkes, then among the Persians.</note> themselues, then it did among the Persians. For the med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley and mingling of the two nations which fought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being all in a confusion and a hurley-burley, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillary entring among them without any exception or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of persons, ouerthrewe both frendes and foes. At the first thondering noise whereof, the Prince was most ready &amp; swift to flie, &amp; all that were with him, follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed presently after him, so that the Turks which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed behind were moreshrewdly afflicted then the Persians were, who by flying away could not feele any dammage, but the Turkes must first bee well payed for their labour. The <hi>Graecians,</hi> the <hi>Constantinopolitanes,</hi> and those that
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:23114:181"/>
were of <hi>Natolia,</hi> pursued these fugitiues, making a shewe as though they would gladly haue ouertaken the stollen carriages, and recouered them againe: but they being already arriued in safety, and the night come vpon them, they feared to proceede any further, then they might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily returne with the safegarde of their liues. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Persians, though greatly wearied and weakened, thus saued themselues, and the Turks also retourned into their Tentes, wholly dismaied and discomfited, leauing too manifest a token of the sondrie calamities which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in these broiles, and the maruellous ouerthrowe of their whole armie. So that there is no man but confess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that in the battell of <hi>Sancazan</hi> there were slaine twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">20000.

            <p>Among the rest, in the same place died also the Visier <hi>Osman,</hi> Generall of the late dreadfull, but now desolate Armie, not by wouuds, (as some write) nor by any such <note place="margin">Osman the Visier and Generall dieth at Saacazan.</note> like means, but being vtterly consumed by the mortall &amp; vncurable disease of an Ague and a Flix, (as wee haue told you before, and doo now againe testifie vnto you, by the certain and vndoubted report of those faithull Phisitians, which were about him,) whose death notwithstandinge was kept secreate from the whole Armie, and euery man thought verily, that it was but onely the continuance of his sicknes, because the charriottes wherein he lay, were still kept close, and in his name <hi>Cicala Bassa,</hi> (for so he had appointed by his will) gaue out aunsweres and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes <note place="margin">The death of Osman disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians by three oungmen.</note> to all the Armie. But although it was thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the Turkes, yet was it disclosed to the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:23114:182"/>
by the meanes of three youngmen, who in the life of <hi>Osman</hi> had the charge of his precious stones, of his iewels, and of his gold, and now hauing gathered together, the best, the cheefest, and the fairest of them, and also the goodliest and the fairest horses that the Visier had, were fled to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and reuealed vnto him the death of the Generall. The comming of these youngmen was most acceptable both to the king &amp; also to the prince, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for the iewels &amp; gold, as also for the aduertisement of <hi>Osmans</hi> death: who reasoned among themselues, that it was not possible for so great cowardise, and so dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a kind of fighting and ordering of an Army to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from the vertue and valour of <hi>Osman,</hi> of whome they had had too manifest a triall and experience in times past: and therefore they were thereby encouraged to put in practise some new and strange kindes of exploytes, and <note place="margin">The Persians encouraged to giue the Turkes a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous farewel.</note> by attempting the vtter ouerthrow of the Turkish rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to giue them an honorable Farewell. And therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the <hi>Persian</hi> Prince, hauing gotten together fourteene thousand men, went to follow the Turkes, who had now raised their Campe, and were remoued to pitch their Tentes neere to a certain streame of salt-water, not farre <note place="margin">A brooke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two armies.</note> from <hi>Sancazan:</hi> where also the said Prince caused certain fewe Tentes to be pitched, about fower or fiue miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the Turkish Campe, the foresaid brooke run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the middest betweene the two Enemies armies. Now it was the purpose of the <hi>Sofian Prince</hi> to haue assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Turks in the morning, whiles they were loading their cariages, hoping in that confusion to haue wrought them some notable mischiefe: but the Turkes had caught a certain spye of his, who reuealed all vnto them. And therefore they did neither arise so earely in the morning
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:23114:182"/>
ás their maner was, nor load their stuffe, vntill such time as they were all armed and on hors-back, trusting by that means to rebate and to quaile their enemies assaults. The <hi>Persians</hi> were greatly discontented, when they saw this warie and vnvsuall maner of the <hi>Turkes</hi> raysing of their Tentes, and perceaued that some inkling had been giuen them of the purpose which they had intended: And yet considering, that if they should loose this occasion, they could not haue any other good oportunitie to annoy them, vntill the next Spring: they vtterly resolued to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">The Persians begin to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault the Turks on the leftside, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide their Artillarie.</note> the assault: and hauing obserued, that the Rankes of their Artillarie were on the right side of the Armie, they began to enter (in the sight of euery man) vpon the left hand. But the Turkes made a wing presently on that side, and so vncouered and vnbarred their Artillarie against the assaylants, to their great losse and danger. Howbeit they were so nymble and quick to shrowde themselues vnder their Enemies armie, &amp; to auoid this mischieuous tempest, that being now come verie neere to the <hi>Turkish Squadrons,</hi> they must needes send out people to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, and ioyne present battel with them. They were purposed before, assoone as they saw the <hi>Turkes</hi> begin to stirre, to haue brought them towards their side, into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie filthy and deepe Moore, which being then drie, yet <note place="margin">The purpose of the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards came to no good issue.</note> breathed fourth a most stinking and foggie ayre, neyther was it doubted of, or feared by any, but onely by those that were acquainted withall, and borne there aboutes: and so verie boldly they went towards that place, enty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their enemies to follow after them. But the Rebell <hi>Maxut-Chan,</hi> and with him that other Traitor <hi>Daut-Chan,</hi> who had knowledge of this treacherie, as being well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with those places, perceaued the policie of the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:23114:183"/>
Enemie, and particularlie gaue notice thereof to <hi>Cicala Bassa,</hi> who presently caused a great compassing wing to be made, commaunding them to set vpon the <hi>Persians,</hi> and to giue them a continuall charge. The commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Captaine was put in execution, and so their fore-front opened it selfe wyth verie large and spacious Cornets vpon the <hi>Prince:</hi> who no sooner saw this kind of order, but by and by he perceaued, that his intended Stratageme was discouered. Whereupon without any stay he began to retyre, and called all his people after him. But they could not be so readie and quick to flye, but that three thousand of them remayned behind, all miserably <note place="margin">3000. Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the myre.</note> styfled and ouer-trodden in the myre, with verie little dammage or losse of the <hi>Turkes.</hi> And this onely battell, among the fiue that were fought vnder <hi>Tauris,</hi> and in <note place="margin">The only bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell among fiue, most hurtfull to the Persians.</note> those quarters, was it that was lesse hurtfull to the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> then to the <hi>Persians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> returned to the pauilions of the <hi>King</hi> his father, and told him the whole action how it had fallen out, together wyth the departure of the Enemie: And so the <hi>Turkes</hi> came to <hi>Salmas,</hi> where the death of their <hi>Visier</hi> was published. From <hi>Salmas</hi> they went afterwardes to <hi>Van,</hi> where they took a surueigh of their Armie, &amp; found <note place="margin">A surueigh of the Armie in Van.</note> wanting therin about fower score and fiue thousand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: and some say, more.

mortall actions that were performed, so that it seemed all the whole Citie was greatly discomforted: and diuerse times, in those few dayes, by sundry persons in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and particularly in the house of <hi>Mahamet Bey,</hi> one of the <hi>San-Giacchi</hi> of <hi>Cairo,</hi> my verie great friend, I heard much rayling vpon the King, many curses of this warre, and infolent maledictions of these many mischiefes. Then was dispersed the great fame of the new Fortresse erected <note place="margin">Newes publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</note> in <hi>Tauris,</hi> of the sacking of that Citie, and of all the losse that hapned therein. And lastly there was a general Edict published in the Kings name, that through all the Cities of his Empire, they should make solemne feastes, &amp; shew other expresse tokens of mirth and reioysing, which the Turkes call <hi>Zine:</hi> And therupon all the Artificers in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> with diuerse goodly and sumptuous shewes, <note place="margin">Feasting in Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> with musicall instruments, and bountifull banketting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Kings royall commaundements.

               <hi>Fraunce,</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> and of other countries, that they should doo the like: But they all aunswered with one accord, that it was neuer the custome of <hi>Embassadours</hi> to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie signe of reioysing, but onely when the King himself in person returned from the like victories.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, great consultation was at <hi>Van,</hi> how they might attempt to send succours to <hi>Teflis</hi> in <hi>Georgia,</hi>

this so important seruice, &amp; could so well discourse vpon the maner how to bring it to passe, and to make the enterprise certaine and secure, that at the last, <hi>Cicala</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Succours ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Teflis, and deliuered to Daut-Chan the Rinegare.</note> 
               <hi>Bassa</hi> deliuered vnto him thirtie thousand <hi>Cecchini</hi> to cary to the Fort at <hi>Teflis. Daut-Chan</hi> went and returned, and releeued those souldiers, without any thing hapning vnto him in his voyage worthie the writing. And yet was this seruice so well accepted by <hi>Amurath,</hi> that he honoured the Rinegate with the dignitie of the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Maras,</hi> a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie seated in the confines of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> neere <note place="margin">Daut-Chan named by the king the Bassa of Maras.</note> to the riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where also the same <hi>Daut</hi> gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, euen at this present day: although there was a speech deliuered out by the same, that King <hi>Amurath</hi> had caused him to be strangled, which was not true. <hi>Maxut-Chan</hi> also, he that was the guide of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Armie to <hi>Reiuan,</hi> and to <hi>Tauris,</hi> was honoured by the same King <note place="margin">Maxut-Chan nominated by the King the Bassa of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo.</note> with the great rich Office of the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo.</hi> Of whom, as also of his children, and of his vassals, I haue had verie many particulars, both touching this warre, and matters of peace, wherein this man was a dealer.

               <q>
                  <hi>Your Lordship hath giuen me to vnderstand, that you desire to be aduertised of all that hath hapned this yeare betweene vs and the Cheselbas: and I, now I haue good leasure to doo it, will not fayle readily so to do. So you shal vnderstand, that from</hi> Erzirum <hi>we came to</hi> Tauris <hi>in forty dayes: and the day before wee arriued at Tauris, at the Bridge of salt-water, our Vanigard was assaulted by the Sonne of the King of Persia, who quite discomfited it, and gaue vs a great ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, with the death of almost fiue thousand of our men, among whom</hi> Aly <hi>the</hi> Bey <hi>of Grecia was one. And because you would know the very day, that we entred into</hi> Tauris: <hi>I do let you vnderstand, that two dayes before our feast, we entred into it in great number. Two daies the Citie was kept locked, because the Persians had gotten the gates, and in that time there was a great fight both within and without the Citie, with the slaughter of our men more then eight thousand, and little losse to the Persians. For</hi> Alycull-Chan <hi>the Gouernour of the Citie, with the best of his people were readie to flie, and abandon the defence of the Citie, who as he went out, met with the</hi> Bassa <hi>of</hi> Maras, <hi>and flew him with many of our men. But afterward being scarred with the Artillarie, that was set right vpon him, he fled away, and all the rest of the Cheselbas-Captaines, who vpon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion also at the last retyred with him. You desire to know, how those of</hi> Tauris <hi>were entreated: and I tell you, that three dayes after we were entred into it, and</hi> Alyculi-Chan <hi>fled with those aboue named, order was giuen for the buylding of a Fortresse in</hi>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:23114:185"/>
                  <hi>the middest of the Citie, which was then all sacked, in such sort, as it was great pitie to see, and yet without any direction or commaundement from the</hi> Visier, <hi>although in deed they haue giuen out speeches, that it was by his appointment. The</hi> Ianni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries <hi>and the</hi> Spahini <hi>of the Porta, tooke away all their goods and houshold stuffe, and twice afterwards sacked it againe: and the second time they slew many of the inhabitants of Tauris, and found a great quantitie of stuffe hidden vnder the ground, and sold their children for ten and twelue Ducates apeece. The buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Fort was finished in six and thirtie dayes, and twelue dayes before this Fabrik was finished, newes came to the Visier, that the Persians, were comming to assault him: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he sent out the sonne of</hi> Cicala, <hi>and</hi> Mahamet <hi>the</hi> Bassa <hi>of</hi> Caraemit, <hi>who from the topp of an hill discouered the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that were comming, and so they descended into the plaine and ioyned battell with them. Wherein it seemed at the first that the Persians would haue taken their heeles, but they returned vpon our men, and pursued them with slaughter to the number of fower thousand Turkes; and took prisoners</hi> Sinan <hi>the</hi> Checaia <hi>or Lieutenant of</hi> Cicala, Chenan <hi>the Kings Chiaus or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, and the Clerk of the</hi> Spahinj <hi>of the Porta. A few dayes before the Fort was finished, the</hi> Visier <hi>was certified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that the Persians were comming in a verie great number to assault him, whereupon he began to set all his Armie in an order? but while he was busied there abouts, the Persians arriued about noone, and setting vpon our men, they faught such a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell from that time till two howers within night, that it cannot be expressed, either with toung or pen. But as farre as mens iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can reach, it is verily thought, that there may be about fortie thousand of our men slaine, with great losse also of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.

Afterwards, the</hi> Visier <hi>being depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from</hi> Tauris, <hi>and arriued at</hi> Sancazan, <hi>would needes stay there and pitch: But whiles they were drawing out their Tents, and euery man busie to encampe, the</hi> Prince <hi>of</hi> Persia <hi>was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered with a great number of souldiers: who seeing vs in this plight, hastened his pace, and betweene our Rereward and the Visier, began battell vpon vs. It was then an hower after day-light, and we had trauailed all that night. From that hower euen vntill euening did this fight last, with such effusion of bloud, as is not credible, and the common opinion is, that we felt the losse of more then twentie thousand persons: among whom there is slaine poore</hi> Vstref <hi>the</hi> Checaia, <hi>so well knowen vnto you. Heere also died the</hi> Visier <hi>of his infirmitie. In the first battell the</hi> Spahini <hi>of the Porta, with certaine of the Kinges</hi> Chiaus <hi>brought to the</hi> Visier <hi>three hundred heads of Persians: but in the second they made no great boast, for in deed both the one and the other was not without great losse vnto them. We remoued from</hi> Sancazan, <hi>and were againe pursued by our enemies the</hi> Cheselbas, <hi>and yet without any fight between them and vs: sauing onely, two dayes after we were departed from them, they took away from the tayle of our Armie, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Camels and Mules, loaden with stuffe, slaues, and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which although they were followed, yet could not be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered: but that</hi> Mahamet <hi>the</hi> Bassa <hi>of</hi> Siuas, <hi>with the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Porta, and of Caraemit, brought vs a thousand heads of Persians, fiue Drummes, and one Ensigne, besides that with our Artill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And to the end you may know how we haue left</hi> Erzirum, <hi>I do further aduertise you, that there are remaining in it certaine</hi> Spahini <hi>of the</hi> Porta, <hi>with certaine</hi> Sardari <hi>and</hi> Vlu-Bassi, <hi>and two</hi> Sangiacchi, <hi>the one of</hi> Bir, <hi>the other of</hi> Marra, <hi>who afterwards fled away both.

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt the Persians in the meane time, were all full of wrath and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Fort that was builded by <note place="margin">The trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the the Persians.</note> their enemies. For on the one side they found themselues not onely disfurnished of artillarie, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther engines to batter the walles downe to the ground, but also to be much fewer in nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, then were sufficient and requisite to resist the tempest of fires, which they knew they must indure in assaulting those that should be enuironed within the Castell. And on the other side, they reconed it too great a shame vnto them, that the enemie hauing made a Fort within their owne naturall Cittie, should quietly rest there, and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently threaten them with daily oppression, and mischee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous calamities in time to come. And therefore being <note place="margin">The determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Persians.</note> pricked on by glory, by vertue, and by very necessity, they determined euen in the sharpenes of winter, to gather fresh souldiers, and reducing the forces of their armie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient order, with trenches of earth, to approach the ditch, and to trie if they could aduaunce a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure as high as their walls, and so attain to the conquest thereof. But in the gathering together of their new men they discouered new difficulties. For then they percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued manifestly, that to hire souldiers either from <hi>Heri,</hi> or from <hi>Gheilan,</hi> it was denied them by <hi>Abas</hi> and <hi>Amet-Chan:</hi> and that the Turcoman nation, which might haue been the readiest and neerest at such a neede, for the late death of <hi>Emir-Chan,</hi> and for the succession of <hi>Aliculi,</hi> were
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:23114:188"/>
growen very contumacious: so that neither the King nor the Prince, nor the presidents and gouernours of the kingdome could tell on which side to tourne them. At the last, foreseeing the safegarde of the Common wealth, they determined to draw the <hi>Turcomani</hi> to a reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hoping that if they should promise them any honest satisfaction for the wrong, wherewith they challenged themselues greeued for the death of their captaine, they would become more tractable to do them seruice in their common necessities. And therefore the king sent letters to the heades &amp; captaines of those nations, &amp; principally, to <hi>Mahamet-Chan,</hi> and to <hi>Calife</hi> the Sultan, wherein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring <note place="margin">The Persian king by letters solliciteth the Turcomans. The tenor of the kinges Letters.</note> plainely vnto them the perill of his honour, and the libertie of that whole kingdom, he shewed vnto them that all his hope of ridding <hi>Persia</hi> from that yoke, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting free all those people, which in all ages heretofore had beene so faithfull and frendly vnto them, was reposed onely in their aide and assistance: and that their onelie Armes was hable not onely to mainetaine, but also to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the renown of valour in the Persian nation: which estate, as in yeares forepassed it wrought enuie and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour euen in the farthest and most remote peoples of all <hi>Asia,</hi> so at this present, if it bee not succoured and relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, standeth in termes to become a most miserable spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle to all the world. And that therefore, forgetting all thinges that are past, as being doone not to worke any shame or scorne to their nation, but onely for zeale and loue to the kingdome, they wold demand such satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they would require: for hee would bee ready to agree to any iust request they should make. With these and perhaps with more affectionate and passionate let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were the wrothfull <hi>Turcomani</hi> inticed to the reuenge
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:23114:189"/>
of the iniuries which they had receaued by the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> forces. To which Letters they were not a whit slacke in framing an aunswere, but readily wrote back, <note place="margin">The aunswere of the Turco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni, and their craftie deuises.</note> that they would come vnto hym, and put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whatsoeuer for the common necessitie he should command.</p>
            <p>Now they had already craftely concluded among themselues, that they wold not suffer any other to sit in the ranke of their Captaines in the rowme of <hi>Emir-Chan</hi> lately deceased, but onely the young <hi>Tamas</hi> the Kinges thirde sonne. Which conclusion they had plotted to themselues, with a resolute mind, to cause him to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for King at <hi>Casbin,</hi> in dispight of the king himselfe and of the Prince <hi>Hamze,</hi> nothing regarding, that by this action farre greater seditions would arise in <hi>Persia,</hi> then euerwere yet heard of, but onely being wholly bent to reuenge the sole death of one onely <hi>Emir-Chan.</hi> So vile and so base an account did they make of the honour of their naturall King, and of their auncient religion, that before such matters of so great respect and importance, very audaciously (I will not say temerariously) they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their owne priuate reuenge: and chose rather to become most bloody and cruell against those, to whome they were allied in religion, in blood and in countrie, then against their common enemies. With this mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and fraudulent reasolution, to the nomber of tenne thousand, vnder the conduct of two Captaines <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamet,</hi>

The old credulous king, not suspecting any mischeefe plotted by these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles, was greatly comforted at their comming. And
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:23114:189"/>
although by some of his Sultanes, that had felt some ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this conspiracie, he was aduised to deale circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectlie and warilie with them, and especially not to trust them with any secret, or to let any matter of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be in their defence: yet did he thinke euerie hour to be a thousand, till he had made them satisfaction, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thereby that if they had conceaued any mischeefe in their mindes, they wold lay it aside, and being pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his amiable and courteous entertainement, yeeld themselues in very truth faithfull and obedient vnto him. And therevpon being more constant then hee was in this his imagination, whiles hee bestowed good wordes and giftes among them, at the last hee demanded of them what Captaine they wold nomi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vntoo the dissembling <hi>Mahamet-Chan</hi> made answeare, that their desire was principally to doo him pleasure and seruice: of whose bounty and good inclination they did so well hope, as that he wold not appoint any person but such a one, as should be valourous, noble, and deere and acceptable vnto them. The King stayed not from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them presently to vnderstand, that so hee had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to doo, and frankly declared vnto them, that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tamas</hi> his thirde sonne to bee without any charge, and being desirous to geeue them a Captaine that might please them, to the end they might rest more assured of the good will which hee bare vnto them, and haue a good ostage in pawne thereof, hee had made choise of his childe <hi>Tamas</hi> to be the successour of <hi>Emir-Chan:</hi> and
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:23114:190"/>
that if it so pleased them, they might accept of him, and with one accord endeauour themselues to conquer those odious walles of the Forte, which with so great ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and reproach of all the Persian Nation was there ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Turkes. As soone as <hi>Mahamet-Chan</hi> heard the resolution of the king, who beesides all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offered thus to gratify them, and voluntarily of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, without any suspicion at all, yeelded them the meanes whereby they might put in execution the worke which they had maliciously contriued against the peace and liberty of the kingdome: hee became more ioconde then he was wont to be, and outwardly shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe readie, for whatsoeuer the King would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund him: and yeelded also in the names of all the rest, large promises of fidelity and obedience, so that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might be perfourmed, for which he had now giuen his word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Neither was there any greate <note place="margin">Great hopes that mooue the Turco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault the fort.</note> time consumed therein: For they had nowe almost made the farther side of their ditch euen with the enemies wall, and the ditch it selfe was also almost filled vp with earth, so that there wanted but little more labour to begin the desired assault.</p>
            <p>And nowe was there a great fame published ouer all the East, in what daungers the newe Fortresse was vpon <note place="margin">Aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments sent into Italie.</note> these occasions, yea and aduertisementes were nowe sent into <hi>Italie,</hi> that it was quite demolished, ouerthrowne to the ground, and burnt by the Persians: when as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the common opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and contrarie to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique expectation, wherewith al the world was nowe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished, that false and wicked Traitor <hi>Mahamet-Chan,</hi> with all his <hi>Turcomanni,</hi> leading away with them the child <hi>Tamas,</hi> departed in the night time and vpon a sudden from <note place="margin">The Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the Turcomanni.</note> so noble and honourable an enterprise: and being vtterlie blinded with ardent desire to put in execution his ill-hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched purpose, couertly and without any noyse remooued from the besieged walles, and put himselfe on his way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Casbin,</hi> still terming <hi>Tamas,</hi> by the name of the king of <hi>Persia,</hi> and sundrie wayes abusing and mocking the poor olde king, and the Prince. Great was the astonishment of the subiect Cities, when they hard the new publication of this vnripe &amp; vnexpected yong King. Great was the griefe, that the olde king conceaued of this daungerous rebellion. But verie greate was the sorrowe that afflicted the Prince,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:23114:191"/>
for these alterations of so great importance. Whereby not onlie so honourable and so necessarie an enterprise was quite abandoned, but also ther was put in hazard the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of his own dignitie, the honour of that Scepter, the peace and quiet of the Kingdom, and his succession to the Crowne which was due and appoynted to him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <note place="margin">The Doubtes of the Persian Prince.</note> being wholly incensed with griefe and anguish, hee began to tosse and retosse a thousand deuises in his heade, that he might resolue what he were best to attempt. To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the siege of the Forte, it grieued him aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and to suffer so pernicious a rebellion to go forward it semed also to be too dangerous for the state of <hi>Persia.</hi> To prouide for both these inconueniences at one time, it was altogether impossible.

Those of <hi>Saitan Chalasi,</hi> by the Kinges direction relinquished their Forte, because the King thought, that <hi>Lory</hi> a Fortresse verie neere thereunto, was sufficient for the defence of that quarter: and now that there was a newe charge for maintenance of Souldiers in the Forte of <hi>Tauris,</hi> added to his other expences, this might be very well spared. And hereupon there was a lying rumour spread at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> that <hi>Lory</hi> was recouered by the Georgians.</p>
            <p>The Bassa of <hi>Reiuan,</hi> more for couetousnes then for any glory, being very angry that the nation of the <hi>Chiulfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lini</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Bassa of Reiuan at Chiulfal.</note> did bring no presentes vnto him, seeing that <hi>Leuento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli</hi> had sent very rich gifts to the Bassas of <hi>Van</hi> and of <hi>Teflis,</hi> setled himself against the Country of <hi>Chiulfal,</hi> and made an inroad vpon them to annoy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with a thousand fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Harquebusiers. The <hi>Chiulfalini</hi> being aduertised here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, shut vp their gates, and stayed wayting for the comming of the Bassa, with purpose to pacifie him, by sending him some bountifull presents.

great enemie to the Turkes. The Bassa thus went against them, and being arriued at <hi>Chiulfal,</hi> hee founde it defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with good store of armed souldiers, and the gates well and safely locked. Notwithstanding the Bassa was entertayned by their Embassadors, who were already gone out to meete him with their liberall presents, and to entreat him that he would accept of the peoples good wils: Who if they had not heretofore brought vnto him their voluntarie tributes, it was done for feare least they should haue fallen into the displeasure of their King: who no doubt if hee should haue vnderstood any such matter, would haue bene ready to destroy their countrey, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue <note place="margin">The Bassa of Reiuan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth from Chiulfal we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Bassa who rather to make a booty, then for any other cause had that inroad, receauing his presents, was well pleased with their intertainment, allowed the excuses of the <hi>Chiulfali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> and returned again to <hi>Reiuan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Aduertisement hereof did flie in all hast to the Persian King, who imagining that besides the paimente of these voluntarie tributes some worse thinge had happened, dispatched away <hi>Alyculi Chan</hi> with three thousande Souldiers, and with this direction, that if the Countrey were subdued by the Turkes, hee should fight against it: And if it had voluntarily yeelded it selfe vnto them, hee should not onlie recouer it, but also burne it, and bring away all the chiefe men of the Countrey for prisoners and slaues. <hi>Alyculi</hi> went to <hi>Chiulfal,</hi> and finding the matter to haue passed as before is described, without vsing either <note place="margin">Aliculi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chan at Chiulfal.</note> sword or force, hee perwaded them, that in signe of their obedience still continued towardes the Persian Prince, they woulde present him with greater and more liberall giftes, then they did their enemie Bassa. The <hi>Chiulfalini</hi>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:23114:193"/>
were verie readie to perfourme what hee required, and pleased him in fuch sort, that hee caried backe verie good tydinges of their fidelity and obedience to the King.

            <p>Whiles the <hi>Chiulfalini</hi> were in this sorte molested, <hi>Giaffer</hi> the Bassa of the Forte, fearing leaste the Persian Prince would returne with the Turcomanne forces, and <note place="margin">Giaffer the Bassa in a great feare.</note> with a mightie Armie for the siege, perceiuing himselfe euerie day to vvaxe weaker and weaker, by reason that manie did secretelie and priuilie flie from him, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to sende aduertisement thereof to the <hi>Bassa Cicala</hi> at <hi>Van:</hi> signifying to him by writing, that hee feared greatly least if the Prince should returne with Souldiers to assault the Forte, he should of necessitie be inforced to yeeled it vp vnto him, because manie were fled out of the Fortresse, manie perished by sicknesse, and many also slaine, whiles too boldlie and rashlie they aduentured to goe abroad to prouide victuals. And that therfore he would take care, as he tendered the honour of his Sultan, to send him succour, to the end that at the return of the Prince he might be able to resist him and maintaine himselfe.

But although these expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and desired succours, were not conueighed to the Fort accordinglie, yet had <hi>Giaffer</hi> as good fortune as hee coulde vvish. For the preparations of the Prince were so long and troublesome, and his returne so much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, that there was time ynough yeelded vnto the Turkish Generall, now newlie chosen, (as by and by shal bee tolde you) to goe into those quarters, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue all that, which the onlie expedition and celeritie of
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:23114:194"/>
the enemie might haue put in great hazard, and almoste haue brought to a desperate case.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, at the Citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the King was in a greate doubt within himselfe, what hee <note place="margin">K. Amurath busied about the election of a new Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note> were best to resolue for the choyce of a newe Captaine. On the one side <hi>Osman</hi> the <hi>Bassa</hi> hauing by his last will and testament left <hi>Sinan Cicala</hi> to be his successour, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie dangers he had runne through in the quarrelles about <hi>Tauris,</hi> and besides these his desertes, the greate fauours that <hi>Cicala</hi> had in the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> did make the King great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incline to this his election. On the other side he heard of a certaine publike rumour spread among the Souldiers, that they coulde not by any meanes endure, to haue so yoong a Captaine appointed ouer them, giuing out in plaine tearmes, that euery man might knowe it, that they would not obey him, and that some daungerous disorder would ensue vpon it in matters touching the Armie. Then was there also <hi>Ferat</hi> the <hi>Bassa,</hi> the same man which once already had had that charge, before <hi>Osman</hi> had it: and hee shewed himselfe verie ambicious and desirous of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and had of late performed some honest and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient office in the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> whereby the King might take some liking of his person. Any other to make choice of, he had none, so that in this consultation with himselfe, hee was vtterly vnresolued what to doe. Yet in the end, because he was to prouide in good time for his businesse, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to make choyce of <hi>Ferat,</hi> a man of great fidelitie, of <note place="margin">Ferat the Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa chosen Generall.</note> honourable valour, and already throughly instructed in all such points, as were necessarie for the brideling of such an Armie. Him therefore he chose to be Captaine for the conducting of his succours to <hi>Tauris,</hi> and to him hee graunted the ordinarie authoritie to manage at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:23114:194"/>
such affayres of the Empire, as concerned this his iorurney.</p>
            <p>Vppon this resolution, generall preceptes were sent out to all Citties within the Kingdome, and to the <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sas,</hi> the <hi>Sangiacchi,</hi> and other Gouernours and Officers thereof, with speciall commandement, that all their soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, together with their taxes, tenthes, munitions, vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualles, Armour, Artificers, and to bee short all their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie furniture and prouision should be readie and in order vpon the firste warning that should bee sent vnto them at the next Spring. And direction was geuen to <hi>Ali-Vcchiali</hi> the Captaine of the sea, that hee should arme fourteene Gallies for conduct of the Ianizzaries to <hi>Trebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonda,</hi> and such other garrisons as were to bee transported to <hi>Erzirum,</hi> and from thence to bee employed where the Generall should commaund. Great prouision of money was made, and in <hi>Soria</hi> (besides the ordinarie somme that is bestowed vpon the yearely pay of Souldiers in <hi>Reiuan,</hi> in <hi>Erzirum,</hi> in <hi>Aggiachalasi,</hi> in <hi>Lory,</hi> in <hi>Tomanis,</hi> in <hi>Teflis,</hi> and in <hi>Chars,</hi> which swallowe vp all the reuenue of that Countrey, and also of the Cittie of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> and amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the summe of sixe hundred thousande Duckatets) <note place="margin">The reuenue of Soria 600000. duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kats.</note> there was taken vp in prest, of priuate Merchantes in the Cittie of <hi>Aleppo</hi> onely, the summe of three score thousand <hi>Cecchini,</hi> to bee repayed vnto them with the firste mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes that should bee teceiued by the Officers of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome <note place="margin">A loane of 60000.

A matter that mooued an extraordinarie grudging among the people, for that it seemed a verie strange and intollerable exaction to euerie man, besides so manie grieuances and impositions laid vpon them for corne, for carriages, for Pioners, and for workmen, to endure this burthen also of lending their money without
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:23114:195"/>
any hope of restitution thereof. Yea and in deed euery man did greatly woonder, how they were thus ill adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, by this meanes to make it knowne to the Christian Princes, what scarsitie and want of money they had. The <note place="margin">400. peeces of artillerie with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note> Generall had also with him foure hundred peeces of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery: and did besides so worke the matter, that <hi>Maxut-Chan,</hi> who was now appointed the Bassa of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> vvas graunted vnto him to bee the guide of his Armie, and <note place="margin">Maxut-chan, Guide of the Armie.</note> that <hi>Cicala</hi> the Bassa of <hi>Van,</hi> beeing scarse his good friend was remooued from thence, and sent as Bassa to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus hee departed from <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Aprill, and by the way of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> passing ouer <note place="margin">Ferat depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> the Sea into <hi>Asia,</hi> hee came to <hi>Siuas,</hi> in trueth, something later than hee should haue done, by reason of the greate plague, which at that time did generally afflict and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouslie vexe the Citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> besides manie other <note place="margin">Tht plague at Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</note> occasions and executions that hindered his iorney.

Neither was it the plague onely that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this his stay (for the most parte of the Turkes make no more dayntie to auoyde the plague, then wee vse to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewe <note place="margin">Exceeding dearth at Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zirum and Aleppo.</note> any gentle disease:) but another greate cause of it was the exceeding dearth of victuals in <hi>Erzirum,</hi> where there was neither graine nor corne sufficient for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of their Cattell and men: which dearth was also so great in <hi>Aleppo,</hi> that a <hi>Venice-</hi>bushel of wheat was fold for a dozen <hi>Checchini.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:23114:195"/>
At the latter ende of those dayes, wherein <hi>Ferat</hi> made his abode in <hi>Siuas,</hi> and was nowe readie to departe from thence, there came vnto him certaine postes sente <note place="margin">Aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Giaffer the Bassa of Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Ferat.</note> from <hi>Giaffer</hi> the Bassa of <hi>Tauris,</hi> by whome hee was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised, how the Persian Prince was hourelie expected with a populous Armie following him, and that if hee should foreslowe to send succours, and to preuent the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Prince, and so giue him time and leasure to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulte the Fortresse, hee was in exceeding greate feare, least the Prince might surprise the same. Vpon this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisement <hi>Ferat</hi> presentlie remooued, and hastened his iourney in such sorte, that hee was in <hi>Erzirum</hi> about the beginning of August: where hee was scarslie arriued, <note place="margin">Ferat in Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zirum.</note> but suddenlie being prouoked thereunto by the reporte of the Princes comming, which was daylie more and more confirmed, hee set himselfe towardes <hi>Van.</hi> To which place all the Souldiers of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masco,</hi> of <hi>Iurie,</hi> and of <hi>Palestina</hi> were alreadie gone by the way of <hi>Caraemit:</hi> for so they were commaunded to do, because they might auoyde the Cittie of <hi>Erzirum,</hi> from whence, by reason of the great dearth <hi>Hassan</hi> the Bassa, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nernour thereof was remooued, and coulde not keepe residence there, but withdrewe himselfe to <hi>Chars,</hi> where hee lay at greater ease and lesse charges. <hi>Ferat</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made haste to <hi>Van,</hi> where hauing gathered all his <note place="margin">Ferat at Van.</note> Souldiers together, and made a reuision and newe sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh of all his Armie, hee departed thence, and being presentlie come into the open and large Champaynes, hee marshalled them in such sorte, as though hee shoulde haue bene prepared to fight the Battell. Wherein hee <note place="margin">The marshal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Ferat Armie.</note> did imitate olde <hi>Sinan</hi> the Bassa, vvho although hee reaped small commendations for these his fained battels,

whereof he made shew in the <hi>Champeynes</hi> of <hi>Chielder,</hi> yet notwithstanding hee shewed greate cunning and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in matter of warre, for that hee woulde bee assured of the Arte and discipline of his Souldiers: without which, manie Armies in numbers infinite and in Armes terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, haue bene defeated by few squadrons in number far fewer, and in Armes lesse fearfull, though in matter of Warre, and skill in fighting more cunning and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced.</p>
            <p>And therefore for the Vaunt-garde of his Armie hee appointed the Bassa of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> with all his souldiers: <note place="margin">His Vauward.</note> a people watered on the one side with <hi>Tigris,</hi> and on the other side with <hi>Euphrates,</hi> partlie infected with the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of the Arabians, and partly endued with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie of the Armenians: And of these, to the number of twelue thousande.

But forasmuch as rebellion and discorde, those two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall Ministers of the Deuill, haue for the vtter vndo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ouerthrowe of the glorie of <hi>Persia,</hi> continually fauoured the Turkish Armies. No maruell it is, that the Persian Nation cannot vaunt of any reuenge, that they haue taken of anie one indignity offered vnto them by their enemies: and that our Writers cannot choose but write of the true and vndoubted victories of the Turks, and the bare shadowes of the Persian exploytes. Which notwithstanding (but all in vaine) our Christian Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, euen vntill this day, although they doe see the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest prospering, and euident conquestes, which the Turkes haue had in diuers States and Countreyes, yet doe they easilie beleeue, because they doe moste ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie desire them to bee true. But wee vvill not fayle as trulie as possiblie wee may, to reporte, whatsoeuer wee vnderstande to haue happened: that out of our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges the Readers may take such aduise, as out of such aduertisementes may bee gathered.</p>

The Persian Prince arriued at <hi>Tauris</hi> with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test parte of his Armie, about the twentie eighth of the Moone <hi>Regeb,</hi> which may bee about the latter ende of <hi>Iulie:</hi> In which place euery body thought verily he would haue stayed, and attended the conquest of the Forte: which now hee might haue vtterlie destroyed with more <note place="margin">The Persian Prince at Tauris.</note> ease than before he coulde haue done, because the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that were in it were reduced to a very small number, and those that did remayne were greatly impayred by sundrie inconueniences, and withall shrewdlie terrified with the expectation of the Princes arriuall. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this common opinion, and publike conceite was vtterlie frustrated. For <hi>Amze</hi> did not onelie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to attempt this expugnation, but hee scarse taried any while in the Citie of <hi>Tauris.</hi> The cause of this his so doing, is diuerslie, yea and vainlie reported. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians and all their adherentes say, that Prince tooke <note place="margin">The cause why the Prince at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth not the winning of the Fort.</note> this course, not because hee was not able immediately to besiege the Forte, and easilie to haue gotten the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ouer it, (for they did not sticke verie gloriouslie to vaunt, that it was in his power so to doe,) but onelie because if hee had taken and destroyed the Forte, then woulde the Turkes haue for borne to come to <hi>Tauris,</hi> and so the Prince should haue loste the opportunitie of ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning battell with them, and plaguing the Turkish Armie with such losses and discomfitures, as hee earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to afflict them withall: meaning notwithstanding to destroy the Forte, after hee should haue satisfied his lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to bee reuenged on his enemies Campe. Others cannot beleeue that the Prince woulde relinquish so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie and honourable enterprise for any such respect: for they were of opinion, that <hi>Amze</hi> could not haue had a
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:23114:198"/>
more glorious reuenge, nor more grieuouslie endom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged his enemies, then by ouerthrowing that Forte, which to the greate daunger and perill of the Persians was erected euen in the middest of them: yea that Forte, for the building and accomplishment whereof, they had compassed all those mischiefes the laste yeare. Another cause also there is yeelded of this his so doing: And that is, the infirmitie which the Prince knew to be in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as a man vnacquainted with the daungerous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptes of a siege, verie fearefull of Artillery, and more corragious in anie other kinde of battell, then these that are vsed to be foughten vnder the walles of any place. But let it be that he was lead by eyther of these two respectes, it maketh no greate matter: The trueth is, that <hi>Amze</hi> with all the troupes, which hee brought with him (the number and order whereof shall bee shortly hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto you) did scarse make any stay in <hi>Tauris.</hi> For he had vnderstood, that before the Cittie of <hi>Salmas Zei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> the <hi>Bey,</hi> by nation a <hi>Curdo,</hi> and by office the Bassa of that Cittie, had encamped himselfe: whome hee determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned suddenly to set vppon, and chastise, not onely for his rebellion, whereby of a Persian hee became a Turke, but also for many other his insolent behauiours, which hee had diuers times vsed against the liberties and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Citties of <hi>Persia.</hi> This determination hee put in execution, and being accompanied with twelue thousande Souldiers, hee rode to <hi>Salmas,</hi> where finding <hi>Zeinell</hi> with all his people, hee gaue him the assault. <hi>Zei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi> was more readie to flie and make escape, then min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to fight or make rescues: and his Forces also as ready to followe his example: who beeing more intentiue to saue themselues, with their housholde stuffe and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementes
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:23114:199"/>
to resist their enemies, the more they sought by all meanes to preserue their liues, and slippe out of the Persians handes, the more they fell into the spoyle, <note place="margin">Zeinello the Bassa discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by the persian Prince.</note> and were woonderfully ill entreated, so that the Bassa himselfe with a fewe other fugitiues, coulde hardly saue themselues in the cloasest and darkest corners therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boutes. And in this sorte was <hi>Zeinello</hi> and the Cittie of <hi>Salmas,</hi> that was committed to his charge, and defence, <note place="margin">The citie of Salmas also sacked by him.</note> endommaged and left for a praie to the Conquerours: Who entring into their streetes, houses, and Temples, sacked and spoyled the same, exercising thereon such cruelties and indignities, as partlie the naturall desires of souldiers doe vse to practise, and partely such as the Turkes themselues shewed vpon them (as it were for an example howe to doe in the like case) in that miserable and most vnfortunate sacking of <hi>Tauris</hi> the laste yeare. The like spoyles did the Persian Armie make in all those quarters rounde aboute: and so woulde peraduenture haue returned to <hi>Tauris,</hi> but that certaine Spies arriued vpon them, who brought aduertisement, howe the Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa of <hi>Reiuan,</hi> being issued out of his Fortresse with fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred Harquebusiers, had committed the like outrages in the villages and fieldes thereaboutes, as the Prince had done about <hi>Salmas.</hi> With this newes <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ze</hi> was greatlie mooued, and immediatlie raising all his Armie, he iourneyed euen vntill night, towardes <hi>Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uan,</hi> and not farre from the Cittie encountred the Bassa: <note place="margin">The Bassa of Reiuan put to flight &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited by the Prince.</note> who discouering his enemies forces a farre off, beganne in great disorder to flie and retire into his Fort, leauing the greatest parte of his Souldies, being nothing so spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in flight as himselfe, to the fury of the Prince, who slewe them all, and exercised all mischiefe, that might be
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:23114:199"/>
deuised, and al terrible maner of crueltie in those quarters.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all these wrathfull conflictes and broyles of warre, the two famous Prisoners, <hi>Ebrain-Chan</hi> and <hi>Amurat</hi> the Bassa, of whom we haue made mention in the former books of this historie, ceassed not, by peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <note place="margin">A treatie to exchange the two prisoners Ebrain and Amurat.</note> enter course and treatie about their own liberties, to procure that they might interchangeably be inlarged and restored to their owne Lordes. This practise continued verie hote for manie dayes together, and at the laste the Turkes were contented to enlarge <hi>Ebram-Chan,</hi> vppon condition that <hi>Amurat</hi> also might be set at libertie. But the offer was thought to be verie vnequall: For (say the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) <hi>Ebrain-Chan,</hi> was emprisoned against all right, by the dishonourable treacherie and infidelitie of <hi>Amurath,</hi> to the great contempt and vtter subuersion of al lawes, which towardes Embassadours ought most sacredlie and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to bee maintayned in any cause whatsoeuer: and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain-Chan</hi> ought not in any respect to be kept in prison, but with most manifest iniustice and iniquitie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the other side <hi>Amurath</hi> the <hi>Bassa</hi> was lawfully taken captiue, and brought into thraldome, not by deceite of wordes, nor breach of faith, but in plaine battell, euen with the daunger of those that tooke him prisoner, and to bee shorte, agreeablie, and according to the lawes of warre, and Enemy-Nations. And therefore so vnequall and vnproportionable an exchaunge was not onelie vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie to bee denyed and reiected, but also vnreasonable on the Turkes behalfe to be offered. These sounde and effectuall reasons of the Persians coulde not be answered, but eyther by money or by some other meanes that <note place="margin">The treatie of inlarging the two prisoners is in vaine.</note> mighte supplie the defeates of the Turkes inaequalitie:
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:23114:200"/>
Whereunto they woulde neuer agree to yeelde, and so the two Captaines remanyned still in prison as thy did before.</p>
            <p>At the verie same time, in the confines of <hi>Tripolie,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Drusians</hi> of the territorie of <hi>Manogli,</hi> who after the departure of <hi>Ebrain</hi> the Bassa were quietlie and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie retired to their owne homes, beganne to raise new stirres and troubles. Whereuppon the Drusian Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, that were carried prisoners to <hi>Constantinople</hi> by <hi>Ebrain</hi> the Bassa, and were nowe vpon the poynt to bee set at libertie, and to returne to their woonted habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; at the reporte of these fresh troubles and tumultes, were againe restrayned, and clapt vp in close custodie, and in great daunger also to haue lost their liues. Nowe the rumour of these stirres was this: that <hi>Manogli</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing all the Souldiers and garrisons to bee now depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the warre of <hi>Persia,</hi> as wee haue tolde you, and none other prouision sent for the defence of those places, hee determined to issue out into the fielde, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to reuenge the death of his people, which vniustlie, and by treacherie they had suffered, but also to licke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe whole, and by a kinde of violent restitution to bee recompensed for all those bribes and presentes, which with so manie shiftes and subtilties, as before is declared, were extorted from him by the Messengers and Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemes of <hi>Ebrain</hi> the Bassa. For which purpose, beeing issued out into the playnes and Champeignes of <hi>Tripoli,</hi>

<pb n="385" facs="tcp:23114:200"/>
for the defence and rescue of <hi>Balbech, Acra</hi> woulde not stirre a foote, fearing belike least hee might bee endaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered by the valour and resolution of <hi>Manogli,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee was verie well acquainted. But for <hi>Tripoli,</hi> there were diuerse Souldiers, that remayned in that Cittie, and liued as it were in Idlenesse, which with a greate sum of money they had purchased at the handes of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Officers of the Sultan Emperour. And these soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers beganne to bestirre themselues lustelie. In this number of idle mates was one <hi>Mamut Bey,</hi> sometime a <hi>Sangiaccho,</hi> but nowe cassiered and put out of Office, who by meanes of his bribes hauing auoyded to serue in these warres of <hi>Persia,</hi> imagined with himselfe, that such a fitte occasion, whereby hee might shewe himselfe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and readie to represse the insolent inuasions of the <hi>Drusian,</hi> might make him deserue so well at the Sultans handes, that hee woulde bestowe vpon him the office of Customer in that Cittie, which so greatlie he desired. And therefore hee before any of the rest, displaying his Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd, and mustering all his bandes of Souldiers, in so much that hee did not spare the verie <hi>Caddi</hi> and the <hi>Deftardar</hi> (that is to say, the Iudge and Chamberlaine of the Gittie) but made them to ride out with him, he roade to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Drusians and to ioyne battell with them, hoping eyther to destroy them, or honourablie to put them to flight: Or els (as others doe discourse of the matter) in deede not to meete with them at all, but onelie to beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the commendation, that he was readie with his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in his hande for the publike defence of the Cittie, and custodie of his Lordes Countreyes. These Souldiers of <hi>Tripolie</hi> were not farre departed from their Cittie, but
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:23114:201"/>
the Drusians presentlie confronted them, and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall shot of Harquebusies began to disorder and diuide them. But the people of <hi>Tripolie,</hi> although indeede some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what negligently, yet did they continue the skirmish a great while, and would peraduenture also haue endured the battell a longer time, but that in the sight of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, <note place="margin">The Caddi of Tripoli slaine by the Drusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> to the generall astonishment of them all, the <hi>Caddi</hi> or Iudge of their Cittie was shot starke deade with a Peece, and fallen from his horse: Who as among all other men that came out of the Cittie should haue bene the last man that should haue entermedled in such like actions, so was he the first man that was slain in the sight. At this spectacle there arose such a confused feare among the Turkes, that the <hi>Deftardar</hi> or Chamberlaine of the Cittie, without any longer stay fled as fast as hee could into <hi>Tripolie,</hi> and all the <note place="margin">The Drusians bereaue the Sangiacco of his Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd, and kill his standerd-bearer.</note> rest after him. The <hi>Sangiaccho</hi> also, who was the chiefest and busiest instrument of raysing these stirres, had his Standerde bearer slaine, and his Ensigne taken away, with manie other losses that happened besides among the baser sorte. Aduertisementes hereof was sent to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and presentlie thereupon, the Drusian Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines (as wee tolde you before,) were againe restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: <hi>Mendel,</hi> as a great confederate with <hi>Manogli,</hi> that had raised all these troubles, and <hi>Mansurogli</hi> with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, as friendes vnto <hi>Acra,</hi> that woulde yeelde no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in so greate a necessitie.

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:23114:201"/>
Countrey serued rather for a reconciliation and peace making amongst them, then for moouing any vvarre againste them. And in trueth, if euer at anie time there vvere good cause to auoyde newe vvarre, at this time of all other it vvas moste necessarie to auoyde it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause neither the common treasure, nor aboundance of victualles, nor the desire or readinesse of the Souldier did yeelde anie courage to enterprise such troubles: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the huge number of Locustes, vvhich vvere in such aboundance ouer all the Countrey of <hi>Soria,</hi> that in the memorie of all the oldest men there liuing, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vvas there seene so greate a multitude of those Excrementes in those Quarters, did as a moste horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble specctacle mightilie encrease the vniuersall feare of grieuous calamities to ensue thereupon.</p>
            <p>Nowe the Persian Prince hauing made an ende of those outroades and spoyles, vvhich before wee haue mentioned, retyred himselfe to <hi>Tauris,</hi> and towardes his Fathers Campe, gathered together all the reste of his Armye, that vvas novve arriued. The Order, Number, and Condition vvhereof it is not amisse to describe, in such manner and sorte as I hearde it repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> vvhen I made diligent and due enquirie of these nevves there.

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:23114:202"/>
the Turkes and Persians, and by letters among the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Merchantes, and afterwardes it was confirmed also to bee true in deede. From <hi>Heri,</hi> vnder the conduct of <hi>Alyeuli Chan,</hi> they say there came an Armie of eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande: From <hi>Ghetlan,</hi> vnder the gouernment of a sonne of <hi>Amet-Chans,</hi> they say there came feuen thousande <note place="margin">The ordering of the Army of Persia.</note> Horsemen: Of the Turcomannes there were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together about sixe thousand: And all the rest leauied by the subiect and obedient Citties of <hi>Persia,</hi> whereof wee haue often made mention before. And besides all this multitude, the King was guarded by his ordinary Guarde of <hi>Churehi</hi> and <hi>Esahul,</hi> whose number and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie prouisions we haue already described in the second booke. The companie of <hi>Heri,</hi> with some part of the <note place="margin">The order of the Persian prince to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of Ferat.</note> Turcomannes were dispatched by the Prince vnder the conduct of <hi>Alyculi-Chan,</hi> to encounter the Turkish Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: And the like order giuen to <hi>Emanguli-Chan,</hi> who had the Souldiers of <hi>Media,</hi> and the borderers of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> vnder his gouernement. Both these Captaines had in speciall charge, that in the moste narrowe and most deceitfull places by the way they should meete and receiue their enemies Armie, and worke them the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test mischiefe and losse that possibly they coulde. All which, <hi>Amze</hi> did thus order and appoint, because hee thought by this meanes to weaken his enemies Forces, and then being so weakened, to come vpon them with a fresh bartell, and vtterlie to destroy them at their arriual to <hi>Tauris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both the Captaines departed accordinglie, making shewe that they woulde with all affection obey and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the commaundementes of their Prince: But
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:23114:202"/>
neuer was there heard any seruice of moment put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution by them. For <hi>Alyculi</hi> went about to alleage rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and excuses, why they shoulde surcease from mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the Turkes: and <hi>Emanguli</hi> being as yet vtterly ignorant of the wicked purposes and mischieuous trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries of <hi>Alyculi,</hi> followed also his example. But these excuses and delayes of these two Persian Captaines, the Turkish Generall tooke leisure, without any losse or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance at all, to arriue at <hi>Tauris,</hi> and to place the expected succours within the Fort. At what time, by good hap, but by what meanes I knowe not, the Prince was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified of the malignant intent of <hi>Aliculi,</hi> and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signementes, which many of the Sultans had lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued together, to betray the Prince aliue into the handes of the Turkish Captaine. Of which suspition <hi>Amze</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prince Amze retireth for suspition of rebellion.</note> being greatlie affraide, hee durst not onely not trust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to perfourme those battelles that hee had detremined to perfourme, but quite abandoning all this noble and honourable enterprise, hee wholly employed all his care and studie, for the safe custodie of his owne person, and so left the triumph of the matter in the power of the Turks And thus those great hopes and expectations, which the Persians had conceaued of compassing verie famous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploytes against their enemies, did not onely prooue vaine and come to no good issue, but contrariwise by this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie they were conuerted into moste daungerous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances, and all <hi>Persia</hi> thereby endured sundrie altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reuolutions of most important consequences. For both <hi>Aliculi-Chan</hi> and his Complices were pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prince as Rebelles and Traytors, and also <hi>Abas Merize</hi> of <hi>Heri</hi> was manifestlie discouered for a wicked
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:23114:203"/>
and treacherous contriuer of his brothers death. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the common mischiefes were encreased more then euer they were before, and the publike calamities yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded greater hopes to the Turkes, then they had euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued and fostered in all this warre.</p>
            <p>Besides these designementes, there were others also, that contrarie to all expectation came to the like infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate issue, laide and plotted by <hi>Simon</hi> in <hi>Georgia,</hi> who by the direction of the Persian Prince had vnited together his Neighbours the Georgians, for the accomplishing of most noble and honourable enterprises. And the designements of <hi>Simon</hi> were these: That at such time, as he thought most conuenient for sending fresh succours vnto <hi>Teflis</hi> in <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The plot of Simon the Georgian.</note> he meant himselfe in person, with the companie of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or eight thousand Georgians, and with a number of horse-loades of money (if not true loades indeed, yet seeming in apparance so to bee) to present himselfe vnder the Fort of <hi>Teflis:</hi> and to the Turkish Bassa, Gouernour of that Castle, to deliuer a counterfeit commaundement wherein it should appeare, that King <hi>Amurath</hi> did giue the Bassa to vnderstand, that by <hi>Simon</hi> being now conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Turkish Religion, hee had sent fiftie thousande <hi>Chechini,</hi> and other muntion for the Souldiers: and that he had also giuen vnto <hi>Simon</hi> full commission and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie at his pleasure to manage and dispose of that Fort: and therefore that hee should entertaine <hi>Simon</hi> and giue him credence therein. This his defignement <hi>Simon</hi> put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, hoping thereby without force of Armes and without any other inconuenience to make himselfe Lord and Maister of that Castle. But the Turkish Bassa, although both the forme, and the tenour, and the Seale of the commaundement were verie like to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:23114:203"/>
maner of the Court (wherein <hi>Simon</hi> had vsed greate care and diligence:) and although he thought it also verie likelie to bee true, because he was reuolted to the Turkish religion, as hee had fayned in the counterfect comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and that for all these causes he ought to receaue and entertaine <hi>Simon</hi> into the Fort: Yet <hi>Simon</hi> wanting one speciall thing, which in such like cases is a matter of greatest importance, he was deceaued in his expectation, and with great shame and derision forced to retire, and so to auovde the Artillery, that by the direction of the Bassa rayned like a Tempest vppon his Souldiers. Nowe the thing which <hi>Simon</hi> wanted, was a certaine token deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">Simon when his plot came to no good issue, retireth with losse and shame.</note> to the Turkish Bassa, when hee was first appointed Gouernour of that Castle: For to euerie one that is left as Lieutenant in such Fortes, ordinarilie in this warre, with all secrecie, and straitest conditions of allegiance and fidelitie, there is deliuered a Counterfect of the Marke, which shall be vsed by him, that the next yeare follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shall be receiued with succours into the Fort. Which beeing required of <hi>Simon</hi> by the Turkish Bassa, <hi>Simon</hi> knewe not what answere to make, and because he could not so doe, he was disconered to be a treacherous deceauer and for such a one was he presentlie pursued in such and so eager maner as people included within a castle wall, could in so sudden an occasion vse against him. And in this sort, did all the designementes and hopes of the Persians vanish to nothing, and the reporte published in <hi>Italie,</hi> and particularlie in <hi>Rome</hi> of the taking of this Fotte was quite dashed and found to be false, for that the fortunate Turkes remained in quiet possession of the Countreyes which they had conquered.</p>
            <p>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Turkish General had placed his succors in the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:23114:204"/>
Castle of <hi>Tauris,</hi> leauing for the custody thereof <hi>Giafter</hi> the Bassa with his former companies, hee returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes <note place="margin">General Ferat hauing suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured the fort, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth toward Erzirum.</note> 
               <hi>Erzirum,</hi> hauing first caused a Fort to be erected at <hi>Chucchiue Tauris,</hi> a place neere vnto <hi>Tauris:</hi> another at <hi>Coy,</hi> and a thirde at <hi>Cum,</hi> which sometimes belonged to <hi>Ebrain-Chan</hi> now prisoner at <hi>Erzirum</hi> as we tolde you before. And in euerie one of the saide Fortes he left a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie number of Souldiers, with sufficient munition and maintenance for them. Hee sent also afterwardes to <hi>Teflis</hi> in <hi>Georgia</hi> the succours, which they there had long expected and desired, and without any hinderance or difficultie verie willinglie receiued, because the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyt <note place="margin">Succours sent to Teflis.</note> of the <hi>Marke</hi> was well knowne vnto them, which before to <hi>Simon</hi> was both vtterlie vnknowne, and also greatly hurtfull.</p>
            <p>But the Persian Prince hauing hunted <hi>Alyouli-Chan</hi> out of the quarters of <hi>Tauris,</hi> thought himselfe wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the greate feare of treason and rebellion, wherein he liued; and therefore in as great haste as hee could, he put himselfe on his iourney towardes <hi>Genge.</hi> In which place hauing gathered together a good number of Souldiers, hee determined to remooue thence, and to stop the succours for <hi>Teflis,</hi> and so to procure the vtter ouerthrowe of the conductors thereof. Hee had alwayes found <hi>Emanguli-Chan</hi> to be both faithfull and wise, and in him he reposed an assured confidence for perfourming of any enterprise that he had in his hand, and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him euery deuise that he had conceaued in these warres. And therefore hee made heade and ioyned with him, and lodging most familiarlie within his Citty, hee stayed there for the setting in order, and disposing of his foresaide designment, being verie desirous not to

suffer this season to slip, without signification to the world of some notable noueltie which might be correspondent to the fame, that of matters passed and perfourmed the yeare before, was now spread and published abroad ouer all the world.

            <p>What was the occasion therof and who procured his death, diuers &amp; sundry are the opinions of men. Some think that his brother <hi>Abas Mirize</hi> of <hi>Heri,</hi> who had before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired to cause him to bee betrayed into the handes of the Turkish Generall, had now by force of money and giftes perswaded the wicked Eunuch thereunto.

But wee, not onelie are not able to affirme the certen trueth of this accident, but also haue scarse any heart to testifie to the world, that thus or thus in trueth his death was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orshipfull Sir, I haue alwayes made that reckoning of your Worships counsels and aduises, which your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue deserueth, and especially touching those matters whereof it pleased you to aduertise mee, at such time as I was resident in this Citie, and so kindlie entertained therein with all curteous and bountifull entertainment. For whatsoeuer I could
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:23114:205"/>
possiblie obserue in the Historie of the Warres betweene the Turkes and Persians, both concerning words and also concerning matters, I haue endeuoured by all meanes to reduce vnto that note which you deliuered vnto mee, and haue not fayled asmuch as my skill could reach, to put in execution all your good preceptes and aduertisementes. Only there remayneth in this historie one thing which as yet is not throughlie iustified: and that is, mine opinion touching the Citie of <hi>Tauris,</hi> which your Worship by reason of your douhting thereof, made mee suspect at the first, but afterwards it pleased you to allow and confirme to be the best and soundest. And although I haue freely and boldly set downe, that <hi>Tauris</hi> is not <hi>Terua,</hi> as <hi>Iouius</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but <hi>Ecbathana,</hi> as manie others both before and after <hi>Iouius</hi> do take it: and although I find manie reasons wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I haue bene perswaded so freely to auow it: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, when I considered that this was a matter of great importance in this Historie, to entrreat of the true finding out and acknowledgment of a Cittie, for the conquest whereof, almost all these troubles of warres were princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally raised: to the end that all things might the more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appeare, I resolued to publish these my reasons, and particularly to send the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to your W. not only because you first encouraged me with liuely arguments to approue this particularity, being of it self a very important matter, yea &amp; the more importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in regard of the authority of such men as are of the contrarie opinion: but also because you were a great helper vnto me with your owne priuate study to furnish mee with so goodly a number of reasons for the same. By twelue arguments therfore, me thinks I may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely and demonstratiuely reason, that <hi>Tauris</hi> cannot be the <hi>Terua</hi> of <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> but ought indeed to be called the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Ecbathana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:23114:206"/>
My first reason is, because <hi>Strabo</hi> teacheth vs, that the Poole <hi>Mantian,</hi> or <hi>Martian,</hi> or <hi>Margian</hi> (call it as yee will) that which is now tearmed the Poole <hi>Actamar,</hi> is situate <note place="margin">The first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> in the confines of great <hi>Armenia,</hi> and stretcheth euen as far as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fines of <hi>Media Atropatia.</hi> And in the twelfth book of his Geographie, it is manifestlie seene, that there is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther verie little or no quantitie of countrie or people at all betweene the <hi>Mantian</hi> Poole, and <hi>Media</hi> the greater. The same may be collected out of <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> who (as it seemeth) doth place the forenamed Poole, rather in the entrance of <hi>Media</hi> the greater, than in the latter end of great <hi>Armenia.</hi> Out of this certaine trueth I gather this foundation. The <hi>Martian</hi> Poole is in the confines of the Medes and of the Armenians: and therefore it must needes followe, that if <hi>Tauris</hi> should be <hi>Terua,</hi> it must either be in the West, or in the. West Southwest, or in the West Northwest, or els in the verie Northwest of the saide Poole: for in the South or in the North I doo not beleeue that any man doth place it, and if hee should so doe, hee should commit an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, not onely worthy of correction but also of chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But if <hi>Tauris</hi> bee <hi>Ecbathana,</hi> it must either bee in the East, or in the East Southeast, or in the Southeast, or in the East Northeast, or els in the very Northeast. For much lesse will any man be so bolde as to place it in the South, or in the North of the saide Poole, and whosoeuer shoulde so place it, hee shoulde commit a double errour. <hi>Terua</hi> indeede according to <hi>Iouius,</hi> and according to that which the discription of <hi>Ptolomey</hi> doeth inferre, is (as a man may say) in the verie center and middest of great <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and consequentlie it muste bee in the West, or West Southwest, or West Northwest of the said pool.
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:23114:206"/>
Wherevpon, if <hi>Tauris</hi> should be <hi>Terua,</hi> then should <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> haue the very selfe same situation. But both sence and reason, yea &amp; <hi>Iouius</hi> himselfe, &amp; all other doo with one accorde confesse, that <hi>Tauris</hi> is in the East of the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Poole, and by a good quantitie of grounde distant from it. And therefore it remaineth, that <hi>Tauris</hi> is not <hi>Terua:</hi> but <hi>Ecbathana</hi> being a good way distant in the East of the saide poole, a man may conclude, that the verie situation and auncient ruines of <hi>Ecbathana</hi> haue yeelded matter and stuffe to this new <hi>Tauris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And somuch the more likely, because all the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes <note place="margin">The second reason.</note> and souldiers that vse the viage from <hi>Van</hi> to <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and from <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Van</hi> (being a place situate as it were on the easterne banks of the Martian poole) doo vniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly testifie, that in their trauelling from <hi>Van</hi> to <hi>Tauris</hi> they haue their faces looking towards the East: and in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Van</hi> they haue their faces turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the West: and that they passe through certaine vallies between certain mountaines which peraduenture may be the toppes of the Caspian mountaine.</p>
            <p>The like testimonie is geuen by many of the souldiers that went to <hi>Tauris</hi> with <hi>Osman.</hi> Besides whose testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <note place="margin">the third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> we may also make a sound coniecture by the iourney which that army made. For the said armie being gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together at the city of <hi>Erziru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> (which out of all doubt wee must hold to be <hi>Simbra</hi> or <hi>Sinibra</hi> in <hi>Ptolomee)</hi> and by the way of <hi>Hassan-Chalasi</hi> and <hi>Chars,</hi> passing by <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and leauing <hi>Araxis</hi> on the leaft hand, it arriued at <hi>Van</hi> vpon the Martian Poole. And from <hi>Van</hi> it came to the champaines of <hi>Caldaran,</hi> and thence to <hi>Coy.</hi> From which place it passed afterwarde to <hi>Merent,</hi> to <hi>Soffian</hi> (which peraduenture may be the auncient <hi>Soffia</hi> of the <hi>Medes)</hi>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:23114:207"/>
and so to <hi>Tauris.</hi> After that <hi>Tauris</hi> was sacked, and the Forte erected there, the armie retourned to <hi>Van,</hi> &amp; from <hi>Van</hi> by the wonted way to <hi>Erzirum.</hi> Now doo not I know, to what end all this people should go to <hi>Van</hi> and to <hi>Coy,</hi> if <hi>Tauris</hi> were in the sight of <hi>Terua,</hi> which is on this side of <hi>Van,</hi> fiue degrees or there abouts. For it had beene much better for them by a direct course to haue passed from <hi>Chars</hi> to <hi>Terua,</hi> then first to go to <hi>Van,</hi> &amp; then to come to <hi>Chars,</hi> and so to <hi>Erzirum.</hi> Neither can <hi>Iouius</hi> be excused, in saying, that in those dayes they had no such way. For he himselfe in the three and thirtith booke of his histories, (reciting the viage which <hi>Soliman</hi> made, at such time as retiring from <hi>Tauris,</hi> which he had sacked, he iourneyed toward <hi>Mesopotamia,)</hi> doth expressly write, that <hi>Soliman</hi> in his returne first arriued at <hi>Coy,</hi> and to the Champaines of <hi>Caldaran.</hi> And a little after he addeth, that <hi>Tamas</hi> pursuing <hi>Soliman</hi> came to <hi>Tauris,</hi> and from <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Coy</hi> and to the <hi>Caldaran</hi> Champaines. By which voyages <hi>Iouius</hi> might easily perceaue, that <hi>Tauris,</hi> (which in his fourtinth booke he situateth more toward the East then <hi>Coy</hi> is, by the space of foure score miles or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts) by this means must be in <hi>Media</hi> the Greater, where <hi>Ecbathana</hi> is: and that consequently it could not bee thought to bee <hi>Terua,</hi> which by <hi>Ptolomee</hi> himselfe is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the west not onely of <hi>Coy,</hi> but also of the Margian Poole.</p>
            <p>This opinion is also fortified and made manifest by <note place="margin">The fourth reason.</note> the authoritie of <hi>Ptolomee,</hi> who placeth <hi>Terua</hi> for latitude in 78. degrees, and the Martian Poole, 83. degrees. and so setteth <hi>Terua</hi> more towards the west, then that poole is, by foure whole degrees. Howbeit if this <hi>Terua</hi> should be <hi>Tauris,</hi> as <hi>Iouius</hi> will haue it, then should it bee on the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:23114:207"/>
east side of the said Poole, not onely 4. degrees but fiue or six degrees. By these selfe same reasons me thinketh that <hi>Negro</hi> is likewise conuinced, who in his Geographie <note place="margin">The errour of Negro and others.</note> doth resolutely write, that <hi>Tauris</hi> is <hi>Tigranoama.</hi> And with <hi>Negro</hi> are those also confuted, which say that <hi>Tauris</hi> is <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granocerta.</hi> For <hi>Tigranocerta</hi> is by <hi>Ptolomee</hi> situated on the West of <hi>Tigranoama,</hi> and <hi>Tigranoama</hi> on the west of the Martian Poole, by the space of three whole degrees. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth, that <hi>Tigranocerta</hi> was aboue the riuer of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> from which riuer <hi>Tauris</hi> is distant more then twentie daies iourney of sumpter-horses.</p>
            <p>Moreouer another argument may be framed in this <note place="margin">The fift rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> manner. From <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Casbin</hi> at this day it is no more then nine daies iourny: &amp; euey daies iourney may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coned after fiue and twenty miles or thereabouts: which besides that I can iustifie it with the greatest certainety, that may be (next to a mans owne sight) is also confirmed by <hi>Barbaro,</hi> and by others according to <hi>Ramusius.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this iourney could not be finished in so few daies, if <hi>Tauris</hi> were in the situation of <hi>Terua,</hi> considering that from <hi>Terua</hi> onelie to the verie entraunce of the Martian Lake there fall out three degrees, much more to <hi>Casbin</hi> which is in the middest of <hi>Media</hi> the Greater. For vnto <hi>Casbin</hi> the way wold fall out to bee far greater for nomber of miles, of daies-iournies, and of degrees.</p>
            <p>Those also that going from <hi>Tauris</hi> doo trauell in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <note place="margin">The sixt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</note> line towardes the North, do cleere this for a manifest truth. For they report, that after a long iourney, hauing first passed ouer certain mountaines, they doo arriue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Southerne side of the Caspian sea, euen directly wherethose hauens of the sea of <hi>Tauris</hi> are, whereof <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baro</hi>
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:23114:208"/>
speaketh. A thing that was neuer read to haue happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto those, that trauelling from <hi>Terua</hi> doo go in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectlyne towards the North: for they alwaies leaft the saide sea on their right hande, and went into the verie middest of the <hi>Isthmus,</hi> which is a narrowe peece of land situate betweene the Caspian and Euxine seas: as it may sensibly bee iudged, by the right measure of <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mees</hi> Table, without any further reading of other wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or information of trauelling straungers.</p>
            <p>The custome also, which the kinges of <hi>Media</hi> obserued <note place="margin">The seuenth reason.</note> in spending the Sommer season at <hi>Ecbathana,</hi> as a Cittie more cold, more northerne, and more subiect to the winds, seemeth to me to be no small argument for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of myne opinion. For by that custome I doo coniecture, that <hi>Terua</hi> being one of the midland Citties of <hi>Armenia</hi> must needes be lesse cold, and lesse subiect to snowes and windes then <hi>Tauris</hi> is at this day. Whereof all men do with one consent agree, that it is a cold, and a snowie Cittie, and euen in the sommer time subiect to the continuall blastes of the windes.</p>
            <p>Next hereunto may bee added the situation of <hi>Terua,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The eight reason.</note> which in <hi>Ptolomee</hi> is placed betweene <hi>Euphrates &amp; Araxis,</hi> and yet somewhat distant from both the saide riuers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the South: which doth manifestly declare that <hi>Terua</hi> cannot be <hi>Tauris,</hi> because <hi>Tauris</hi> is not onely at this day beyond <hi>Araxis,</hi> but is also beyond the Caspian Sea, whereintoo <hi>Araxis</hi> doth discharge it selfe.</p>
            <p>A man may also drawe no sclender argument, from those that goe from <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Ormus</hi> or <hi>Armuza,</hi> which we <note place="margin">The ninth reason.</note> now call, the Island in the Persian sea, from whence they fetch their pearles and other precious things, although in
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:23114:208"/>
deed it be otherwise somewhat vnhappely seated by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the excessiue heate that raigneth therein. These trauellers leauing the Caspian mountaines on their right hand, and not troubling themselues either with climing ouer them, or with ferrying ouer <hi>Euphrates</hi> or <hi>Tigris,</hi> and without touching either of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> or <hi>Babylonia,</hi> or tourning to <hi>Van</hi> or to the Mantian Marish, do ascend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes towardes <hi>Siras</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> &amp; going as it were south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they come at last to the Persian sea. So that if <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> were <hi>Terua,</hi> and so in the middle region of the greater <hi>Armenia,</hi> then should they not need to go towards <hi>Siras,</hi> but they must of necessity passe ouer rhe Caspian moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, or ferrie ouer <hi>Euphrates</hi> or <hi>Tigris,</hi> or els trauell the rough <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> or tourne themselues towardes the Mantian Marish, or towards <hi>Babylonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the like reason may a man confirme this to bee true, by those that passe from <hi>Bitlis,</hi> (a famous Cittie in <note place="margin">The tenth reason.</note> 
               <hi>Armenia)</hi> to go to <hi>Tauris.</hi> For they must of necessity trauell ouer the Caspian mountaines, and still to iourney east<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, leauing behind them the Mantian marish, the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Coy,</hi> and the <hi>Caldaran</hi> champaines: which whether they be the Champaines of <hi>Araxis,</hi> or some other neere vnto them, let other men vse their owne iudgment: for wee can hardly certify the truth of that particularitie. But if <hi>Tauris</hi> were <hi>Terua,</hi> which is in the middest of Great <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> then should they not neede to make this iourney. For neither should they trauell so much towards the east, neither should they leaue behind them either <hi>Coy,</hi> or the Mantian Marish, or the <hi>Caldarane</hi> Champaines.</p>
            <p>This opinion of mine is no lesse confirmed to be true, <note place="margin">The leauenth reason.</note> by others also, that comming from the furthest partes of the East Indies, doo first arriue at <hi>Cassan</hi> a famous Citty of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:23114:209"/>
the Persian kings, and then trauell to <hi>Tauris,</hi> &amp; from <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> to <hi>Coy</hi> and to <hi>Van,</hi> making alwaies about eight or nyne daies iourney towardes the west: which could not be so, if <hi>Tauris</hi> were either <hi>Terua,</hi> or <hi>Tigranoama,</hi> or <hi>Tigranocer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi>

            <p>Like vnto these reasons is that also which may be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en <note place="margin">The twelft reason.</note> from the iourney that is vsually made from <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Babylonia.</hi> For as euerie man doth testifie, and namely <hi>Angiolello</hi> in his viage lately made into <hi>Persia,</hi> they trauell by south southweast. Which is a manifest token, that <hi>Tauris</hi> is iust in the situation of <hi>Ecbathana</hi> &amp; not of <hi>Terua.</hi> For whosoeuer trauelleth from <hi>Terua</hi> to <hi>Babylonia,</hi> hee must of force trauell not by south southweast, but by southeast.</p>
            <p>These are the reasons, whereby I haue beene perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to leaue this parcell of my history to remaine in such doubt, but haue taken vpon mee resolutely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the same. Which although they be very pregnant and strong, yet shall I account the better of them, if your W. will willingly accept of them, and vouchsafe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the reading of this my letter, vntill you vnderstande also in what sorte <hi>Iouius</hi> and his followers haue on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side confirmed their opinion.</p>
            <p>For three causes doo they belieue, that <hi>Tauris</hi> should <note place="margin">The first ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Iouius and his followers.</note> bee <hi>Terua.</hi> The first Argument is drawen from a verie subtile consideration, which they haue, touching the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude &amp; likenes of the names of all those places, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they doo find that many auncient Citties doo yet at this day retaine the first nomination, although by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of speeche it bee somewhat different from the same. As for example, the Turkes call <hi>Constantinople</hi> by the name of <hi>Stambul,</hi> which is a terme borrowed from the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:23114:209"/>
Grecians, who call this Cittie <hi>Stimboli.</hi> And this terme which the Graecians do vse, was first brought in whiles their Emperours raigned at what time the Citty of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> was called by excellencie <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is to say, <hi>the Cittie:</hi> and such as went thither, or came from thence, vsed to say (euen as we vse also at this day to say of <hi>Rome) We go to the Cittie, we come from the Cittie,</hi> alwaies vsing the terme <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Which Greek worde, being corrupted by the common people of <hi>Graecia,</hi> began first to bee <hi>Stimpoli,</hi> and afterwardes being more deformed and depraued by the Turkes, it came to be <hi>Stanbul.</hi> The like may bee said of the Cittie of <hi>Charsa,</hi> which <hi>Ptolomee</hi> calleth <hi>Corsa:</hi> of <hi>Anguri,</hi> which in old time was called <hi>Ancyra:</hi> of <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> and <hi>Araxis,</hi> the one being now called <hi>Frat,</hi> and the other <hi>Arais:</hi> of <hi>Cesarea,</hi> which still is called <hi>Caisarie:</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which yet is called <hi>Schenderie:</hi> of <hi>Ioppa,</hi> which is called <hi>Iaffa:</hi> of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> which is called <hi>Tachie:</hi> &amp; of many others, among whom <hi>Terua</hi> may also be nombred, which afterwarde with a small alteration of the worde came to be called <hi>Taruis, Teruis,</hi> and <hi>Tauris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this first argument, they added also a second. For <note place="margin">The second argument.</note> they say, that those which trauell from <hi>Amida,</hi> beeing at this day called <hi>Caramita,</hi> the cheefe Cittie of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> &amp; go to <hi>Teruis,</hi> do passe ouer the riuer <hi>Tigris:</hi> which riuer runeth from the one side of the Mantian Marish vnto the other side thereof with such swiftnes, that it is likened to an arrow, and thereof it purchased the name of <hi>Tigris</hi> which it hath at this day, (as <hi>Strabo</hi> teacheth vs). Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doo they passe ouer any other Riuer of fame there. And that is a manifest token, that <hi>Tauris</hi> is in <hi>Armenia,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the very situation of <hi>Terua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides these two reasons, they haue also a third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">The third argument</note>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:23114:210"/>
fortified vpon the relation and report of those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians, that come to <hi>Venice,</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to other partes of Christendome: from whom, it may be peraduenture, that <hi>Iouius</hi> tooke his information. For all these haue ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and at this day doo giue vndoubted testimony, that <hi>Taruis</hi> is in truth in <hi>Armenia.</hi> Which testimonie, if it bee true, then must it needes bee concluded (say they) that <hi>Taruis</hi> can be no other but <hi>Terua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These three argumentes I haue not deemed to bee so pregnant &amp; sure, as that they do deserue or enforce, that I should commit the truth of mine opinion to the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Iouius.</hi> And therefore rather then I wold yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, I haue founde out a most easie way to resolue them, and to aunswere them most sufficiently.</p>
            <p>Wherevpon, concerning their first argument, I say, <note place="margin">The answere to the first argument.</note> that although the similitude of wordes do fall out well in many matters, yet in many other it doth greatly erre, &amp; may easily deceaue vs. For whosoeuer should go about to recon vp all the Citties, and all the Riuers, and all the Mountaines, and all the Prouinces, hee should finde a great want and errour in the most parte of them. And therefore wee will alledge some fewe of them, by whose example a man may know the slender force of the reason that is drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from this similitude of words. And in truth what similitude hath <hi>Damasco</hi> with <hi>Siam? Ierusalem</hi> with <hi>Godz? Arsacia</hi> with <hi>Casbin? Persepolis</hi> with <hi>Siras? Bithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> with <hi>Bursia? Calcedon</hi> with <hi>Scutar? Tyrus</hi> with <hi>Sur? Ptolemaida</hi> with <hi>Acri? Derbent</hi> with <hi>Alexandria? Albania</hi> with <hi>Zuiria? Iberia</hi> with <hi>Gurgistan? Atropatia</hi> with <hi>Siruan? Mesopotamia</hi> with <hi>Diarbech? Appamea</hi> with <hi>Aman? Seleuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a Pieria</hi> with <hi>Soldin? Anazarbo</hi> with <hi>Acsara? Arabia Faelix</hi> with <hi>Giamen? Cilicia</hi> with <hi>Caramania?</hi> and many others
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:23114:210"/>
the recitall whereof wold bee troublesome and tedious. And in deed, with great reason ought we to hold this for an vncertaine kind of argument, which is taken from the liknes of wordes. For those nations, that haue gouerned these regions haue not alwaies had one and the selfesame regard in naming the places which they had subdued. But as in some of them they haue still retained their verie proper names, although their language hath made them somwhat to differ: (as in some aforenamed may be seen, and as now of late we haue obserued in <hi>Cipris,</hi> which yet they call <hi>Cupros.)</hi> So in some others altogether forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their former names, they haue called them by diuers names, according to diuers occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; in diuers respects. Yea and <hi>Iouius</hi> himselfe saith, that <hi>Amida</hi> was called by the Turkes <hi>Caramita,</hi> for the blacknes of the earth: and we also, besides the obseruation of <hi>Iouius,</hi> doo know that <hi>Alexandria</hi> vpon the Caspian Sea is now termed by the Turkes <hi>Schenderia,</hi> (as it shold bee called by the auncient name:) but because it is longe and straite, it came to be called <hi>Derbent,</hi> and because it hath Iron Gates <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir-Capi.</hi> Likewise for <hi>Casbin,</hi> or as the Persians terme it <hi>Casuin,</hi> (let it bee which of the auncient Citties you will haue it to be) it is notoriously knowen, that it was so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led because it was at the first a place, whereintoo they were wont to banish or confine such persons, as for their offences and misdemeanours had deserued that chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which for that it was a place of punishment, it was called by the Persians <hi>Casuin &amp; Casbin,</hi> which in the Persian language signifieth <hi>Chastisement.</hi> The like I might say of the city of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> by the Moors called <hi>Halip,</hi> which in our tongue signifieth <hi>Milke</hi> (for the same <hi>Arabians</hi> do
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:23114:211"/>
say, that it was so called for the aboundaunce of milke, which in the time of the Patriarches was yeelded by the heardes and flockes of cattell in those champaines). But because I haue not that certaine testimony hereof, which I haue of mine other examples, I will not make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to build any foundation therevpon. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore next after those thinges that I haue already noted, I will set down also what I haue obserued touching the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that entreth into the sea betweene <hi>Beryto</hi> and <hi>Tripoli.</hi> Which riuer, because it runneth neere vnto a Church, which was sometimes dedicated to Sainte <hi>Iacob,</hi> is by the inhabitantes there called <hi>Mar Iacut,</hi> which is to say, <hi>the Riuer of Iacob.</hi> Likewise the riuer <hi>Orontes,</hi> which is nombred amonge the famous Riuers of <hi>Soria,</hi> (whose bankes I haue viewed, euen from his springing head to his maine channell, which is neere to <hi>Seleucia Pieria,)</hi> hath among the Arabians and the Turks quite lost his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient name. And because it is very swift in his course, &amp; hath many turninges and windings, (so that those which swim in it are oftentimes drowned therein,) as though the poore riuer had in that respect the nature of a murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, therefore the Turkes and the Moores haue geuen it a name, that signifieth expresly, a murderer or traitor. And to the end that the truth hereof may likewise be knowen in mountains also, I will not conceale that which cometh to my memory touching the mountain <hi>Bacras,</hi> which is also called <hi>Beilun.</hi> This is a mountain, lying in the ranke of the mountains that deuideth <hi>Soria</hi> from <hi>Cilicia,</hi> (which how it was termed by auncient writers, I leaue to other men to iudge). But by the Inhabitants there, it hath been alwaies, &amp; is at this day called <hi>Bacras,</hi> for none other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:23114:211"/>
or cause, but for that it is so ragged, so eaten as it were, and in some partes, euen in the grassie plottes of it, so bald and so bare, that it resembleth the head of one that is scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, which by the Turkes is called <hi>Bacras,</hi> and by the Moores <hi>Beilun:</hi> for so do the Moors also call that moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Hereby then it doth manifestly appeere, that it is no sound argument which is drawen from the likenes or similitude, that auncient names haue with the names of later times. For all places haue not reserued, &amp; retained among the diuersity of sundry languages their auncient denominations: and so it seemeth to mee that this first argument remayneth sufficiently confuted. As also the second, which hauing no good and sound roote, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily bee ouerthrowne.</p>
            <p>Vtterly false is that foundation, which the followers of <note place="margin">Aunswere to the second argument.</note> 
               <hi>Iouius</hi> do vse in that place where they say, that the riuer <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris</hi> passeth from the one side of the Mantian Lake vnto the other side thereof. For it woorketh not that effect, which they speake of, in the <hi>Mantian Marish,</hi> but in the <hi>Marish,</hi> that by <hi>Strabo</hi> is called <hi>Tospite,</hi> and <hi>Topiti,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassena.</hi> I will not here alleadge the testimonies of later li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, as namely of <hi>Cicala</hi> himselfe (the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Van)</hi> nor of a thousand and a thousand marchantes and souldiers, but onely the testimony of <hi>Strabo,</hi> whose authority cannot be refuted as a lyer. Hee, in the eleuenth booke of his Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, thus writeth. <hi>Armenia</hi> hath also great Lakes. One is the <hi>Mantian</hi> Lake, that is to say, <hi>Blacke</hi> and <hi>Greene</hi> like the <hi>Sea Water:</hi> &amp; (as they say) it is the greatest Lake next to <hi>Mwotis.</hi> It arriueth euen vnto <hi>Atropatia,</hi> and hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers salt-springes. The other is the <hi>Arassen</hi> Lake, called likewise <hi>Topiti:</hi> (for so it should be read, and not <hi>Toeti,</hi> as
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:23114:212"/>
some translate it.) This hath <hi>Nitrum</hi> in it: and teareth &amp; renteth a mans apparell, and for that cause the water of it is not good to drinke. The riuer <hi>Tigris,</hi> departing from the mountaine neere vnto <hi>Nifates,</hi> passeth through this Lake, without mingling of it selfe with the water thereof, by reason of his swiftnes, whereof it hath taken his name: for the Medians call an arrow <hi>Tigris.</hi> It hath fishes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and diuers kindes, whereas the fishes of the lakes are but of one kinde onely. Neere to the vtmost corner or Gulfe of the Lake, this riuer falling into a great deep, and running for a great space vnder the ground, riseth againe neere to <hi>Colonitis,</hi> and from thence courseth towards <hi>Opis,</hi> and the walles of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> leauing the <hi>Cordiae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns</hi> on the right hand. All this did <hi>Strabo</hi> write, by the authoritie of <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> in his sixteenth booke: where he saith also most plainely, that the saide Riuer <hi>Tigris</hi> doth not passe through the Mantian Marish, but through the <hi>Topiti.</hi> But no maruell it is, that <hi>Iouius</hi> hath conceaued this errour, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how greatly hee is also deceaued, when he will needs call <hi>Siras, Ciropolis:</hi> when likewise he saith, that in <hi>Cassan</hi> there is trafficke for silkes, and that this Cittie stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in <hi>Sultania,</hi> betweene the South and the West: and lastly, when hee putteth no distinction or difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>Zogdiani,</hi> the <hi>Bactrini,</hi> the <hi>Ariani,</hi> the <hi>Margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Aracosi,</hi> but maketh them all one. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leauing these considerations, it shall be sufficient for me to answere to their last argument, which is drawen from the report of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who say that <hi>Tauris</hi> is situated in <hi>Armenia</hi> the great.</p>
            <p>A reason (in verie truth) verie daungerous, verie slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, <note place="margin">Aunswere to the third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and verie deceitfull. And it seemeth to me to bee
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:23114:212"/>
altogether like to the reason of those, who going about to proue, that the <hi>Amomu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> of <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> is none other thing, but the <hi>Pes Columbinus</hi> (that is to say, the <hi>Pigeon Foot)</hi> of <hi>Mount Libanon,</hi> do vse the common word of the <hi>Sorians,</hi> which call that <hi>Plant Hamana</hi> being in very deed nothing els but a kind of <hi>Pigeon foot.</hi> And in troth what assured credit may bee reposed in those Armenians, and in such kinde of people as are vtterlie vnskilfull in Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, who neuer read any authour, that had taught them the proper Termes of those prouinces? Doo wee not see what a confusion and mingle-mangle they make of the same regions? Doo they not precisely call one part of great <hi>Armenia,</hi> by the name of <hi>Gurgistan,</hi> onely because many <hi>Georgians</hi> inhabite there? And likewise on the other side, doo they not call one part of the great <hi>Media</hi> by the name of <hi>Armeni,</hi> because many <hi>Armenians</hi> do at this day dwell dispersed here and there in diuers villages of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? But vnder the word <hi>Rumeli,</hi> which in our language signifieth <hi>Greece,</hi> how many places doo the Turkes enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine, which are quite out of <hi>Greece?</hi> And with their <hi>Natolia</hi> and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This is as much as I thought sufficient to aunswere the <note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> reasons of <hi>Iouius,</hi> &amp; to confirme mine owne opinion. All
