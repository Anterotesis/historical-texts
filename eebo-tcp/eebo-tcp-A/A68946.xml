            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of late into my handes (after I had

of our late VVeſt Indian voyage, vvhich
vvas begun by Captaine Bigges, vvho en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

the ſight vvhereof is vvonderfully deſired by manie honeſt and
vvell diſpoſed perſons. I haue preſumed to recommend the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
thereof, vnto your Lordships protection and fauour, for
theſe tvvo cauſes. The one, for that your Lordships Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
diſpoſition is in the knovvledge of all men that knovv your

I thought it my bounden duetie, hauing profeſſed my

vvhereby ſome man vvill ſay, that it is novve no nevve
matter: yet the preſent time conſidered, hovv doubtfull ſome
of our meaner ſort of people are of the Spanish preparations,
I thinke this Diſcourſe a very fit thing to be published, that
they may ſee vvhat great victories a fevve English men haue
made vpon great numbers of the Spaniardes, euen at home in
their ovvne countreyes. The beholding vvhereof vvill much
encourage thoſe, vvho by fame and bare vvordes are made to
doubt much more then there is cauſe vvhy they should. Vpon
vvhich point, as there may be much ſayd: ſo my ſelfe being no

ſight of the ſaid pinnaces approching nere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, abandonned for the moſt parte all their
ſhippes (being Frenchmen) laden all with ſalt, and
bounde homewardes into France, amongſt which
ſhips (being all but of ſmall burden) there was one
ſo well liked, which alſo had no man in her, as being
brought vnto the Generall, he thought good to
make ſtay of her for the ſeruice, meaning to pay for
her, as was accordingly performed at our returne,
which barke was called the Drake. The reſt of theſe
ſhips being eight or nine, were diſmiſſed without
any thing at all taken from them. VVe being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
put ſomewhat further off from the ſhore, by
the contrarietie of winde, we happened to meete
with ſome other French ſhips, full laden with New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
fiſh, being vpon their returne homeward from
the ſaid New found land: whom the Generall after
ſome ſpeech had with them, and ſeeing plainly that
they were Frenchmen, diſmiſſed without once ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
any man to go aboord of them.</p>
            <p>The day following ſtanding in with the ſhore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
we diſcried an other tall ſhip of twelue ſcore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23483:5"/>
tunnes or thereabouts, vpon whom Maiſter Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leill
the Lieutenant generall being in the Tiger, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke
the chaſe, whom alſo anone after the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
followed, and the Tiger hauing cauſed the
ſaid ſtrange ſhip to ſtrike her ſailes, kept her there
without ſuffering any bodie to go aboord vntill the
Admirall was come vp: who foorthwith ſending for
the Maiſter, and diuerſe others of their principall
men, and cauſing them to be ſeuerally examined,
founde the ſhip and goodes to be belonging to the
inhabitants of S. SEBASTIAN in Spaine, but the
marriners to be for the moſt parte belonging to
S. Iohn de LVCE &amp; the paſſage. In this ſhip was great
ſtore of drie Newland fiſh, commonly called with
vs Poore Iohn, wherof afterwards being thus found
a lawfull prize, there was diſtribution made into all
the ſhips of the Fleete, the ſame being ſo newe and
good, as it did very greatly beſtead vs in the whole
courſe of our voyage. A day or two after the taking
of this ſhip, we put in with the Iſles of BAYON, for
lacke of fauourable wind, where we had no ſooner
anckered ſome part of the Fleete, but the Generall
commaunded all the Pinnaces with the ſhip boates
to be manned, and euerie man to be furniſhed with
ſuch armes as was needefull for that preſent ſeruice,
which being done, the Generall put him ſelfe into
his Galley, which was alſo well furniſhed, and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23483:6"/>
towards the Citie of BAYON, with intent, &amp; the
fauour of the Almighty to ſurpriſe it. Before we had
aduaunced one halfe league of our way, there came
a meſſenger being an Engliſh Marchant form the
Gouernour, to ſee what ſtraunge Fleete we were,
who came to our Generall, and conferred a while
with him, and after a ſmall time ſpent, our Generall
called for Captaine Sampſon, and willed him to go
to the Gouernour of the Citie, to reſolue him of
two pointes. The firſt, to knowe if there were any
warres betweene Spaine and England. The ſecond
why our Marchants with their goods were imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or arreſted. Thus departed Captaine Sampſon
with the ſaid meſſenger to the citie, where he found
the Gouernour and people much amazed of ſuch a
ſudden accident.</p>
            <p>The Generall with the aduiſe and counſell of
Maiſter Carleill his Lieutenant generall, who was
in the galley with him, thought not good to make
any ſtand, till ſuch time as they were within ſhot of
the Citie, where they might be readie vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
of Captaine Sampſon, to make a ſudden at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
if cauſe did require before it was darke.</p>
            <p>Captaine Sampſon returned with his meſſage in
this ſort. Firſt, touching peace or warres, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
ſayd he knew of no warres, and that it lay
not in him to make any, he being ſo meane a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23483:6"/>
as he was. And as for the ſtay of the Marchants
with their goods, it was the kings pleaſure, but not
with intent to endommage any man. And that the
kings conter commandement was (which had bene
receaued in that place ſome ſeauennight before)
that Engliſh Marchants with their goods ſhould be
diſcharged: for the more verifying whereof, he
ſent ſuch Marchants as were in the towne of our
Nation, who traffiqued thoſe parts: which being at
large declared to our Generall by them, counſell
was taken what might beſt be done. And for that
the night approched, it was thought needefull to
land our force, which was done in the ſhutting vp of
the day, &amp; hauing quartered our ſelues to our moſt
aduantage, with ſufficient gard vpon euery ſtraight,
we thought to reſt our ſelues for that night there.
The Gouernour ſent vs ſome refreſhing, as bread,
wine, oyle, apples, grapes, marmalad and ſuch like.
About midnight the weather beginnes to ouercaſt,
inſomuch that it was thought meeter to repaire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord,
then to make any longer abode on land, and
before we could recouer the Fleete, a great tempeſt
aroſe, which cauſed many of our ſhips to driue from
their ancher hold, and ſome were forced to ſea in
great perill, as the barke Talbot, the barke Hawkins
and the Speedewell, which Speedewell onely was
driuen into England, the others recouered vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23483:7"/>
the extremity of the ſtorme laſted three daies,
which no ſooner beganne to aſſwage, but Maiſter
Carleill our Lieutenant generall, was ſent with his
owne ſhip and three others: as alſo with the galley
and with diuers Pinnaces, to ſee what he might do
aboue VIGO, where he toke many boats and ſome
Caruels, diuerſly laden with things of ſmall value,
but chiefly with houſhold ſtuffe, running into the
high countrey, and amongſt the reſt, he found one
boate laden with the principall Church ſtuffe of the
high Church of VIGO, where alſo was their great
Croſſe of ſiluer, of very faire emboſſed worke, and
double gilt all ouer, hauing coſt them a great maſſe
of money. They complained to haue loſt in all kind
of goods aboue thirtie thowſand Duckets in this
place.</p>
            <p>The next day the General with his whole Fleete
went vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iles of BAYON, to a very good har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
aboue VIGO, where Maiſter Carleill ſtayd his
comming, aſwell for the more quiet riding of his
ſhips, as alſo for the good commoditie of freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
which the place there did afoord full well. In
the meane time the Gouernour of GALLISIA had
reared ſuch forces as he might, his numbers by eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
were ſome two thowſand foot, and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
horſe, &amp; marched from BAYON to this part of
the countrey, which lay in ſight of our Fleete, where
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23483:7"/>
making ſtand, he ſent to parle with our Generall,
which was graunted by our Generall, ſo it might be
in boates vpon the water: and for ſafetie of their
perſons, there were pledges deliuered on both
ſides, which done, the Gouernor of GALLISIA put
him ſelfe with two others into our Vize-Admirals
Skiffe, the ſame hauing bene ſent to the ſhore for
him: And in like ſort our General in his own Skiffe,
where by them it was agreed, we ſhould furniſh our
ſelues with freſh water, to be taken by our own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
quietly on the land, and haue all other ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
paying for the ſame, as the place would
affoorde.</p>
            <p>VVhen all our buſineſſe was ended, we departed,
&amp; toke our way by the Iſlands of CANARIA, which
are eſteemed ſome three hundred leagues from
this part of Sapin, &amp; falling purpoſely with PALMA,
with intention to haue taken our pleaſure of that
place, for the full digeſting of many things into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and the better funiſhing our ſtore with ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
good things as that affoordeth very abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,
we were forced by the vile ſea gate, which
at that preſent fell out, and by the naughtineſſe of
the landing place, being but one, and that vnder the
fauor of many Platformes, well furniſhed with great
ordinance, to depart with the receipt of many their
Canon ſhot, ſome into our ſhips, and ſome beſides,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23483:8"/>
ſome of them being in very deede full Canon high.
But the onely or chiefe miſchiefe, was the daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſea ſurge, which at ſhore all alongeſt, plainly
threatned the ouerthrow of as many Pinnaces and
boates, as for that time ſhould haue attempted any
landing at all.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing the expectation of this attempt fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
by the cauſes aforeſaid, we thought it mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to fal with the Iſle FERRO, to ſee if we could find
any better fortune, and comming to the Iſland, we
landed a thouſand men in a valley vnder a high
mountaine, where we ſtayed ſome two or three
houres, in which time the inhabitants, accompanied
with a yong fellow borne in England, who dwelt
there with them, came vnto vs, ſhewing their ſtate
to be ſo poore, that they were all readie to ſtarue,
which was not vntrue: and therefore without any
thing gotten, we were all commaunded preſently
to imbarke, ſo as that night we put off to ſea South
Southeaſt along towards the coaſt of Barbarie.</p>
            <p>Vpon Saterday in the morning, being the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of Nouember, we fell with Cape Blancke,
which is a low land &amp; ſhallow water, where we cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
ſtore of fiſh, &amp; doubling the Cape, we put into
the Bay, where we found certain Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch ſhips of war,

&amp; put fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence to the Iſles of Cape Verde, ſayling
till the ſixteenth of the ſame moneth in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
on which day we deſcried the Iſland of S. IAGO,
and in the euening we anckered the Fleet betwene
the towne called the PRAY or PRAY and S. IAGO,
where we put on ſhore a thouſand men or more,
vnder the leading of Maiſter Chriſtopher Carleill
Lieutenant Generall, who directed the ſeruice moſt
like a wiſe commaunder. The place where we had
firſt to march did affoord no good order, for the
ground was mountaines and full of dales, being a
maruellous ſtonie &amp; troubleſome paſſage, but ſuch
was his induſtrious diſpoſition, as he would neuer
leaue, vntil we had gotten vp to a faire plaine, where
we made ſtand for the aſſembling of the Army. And
when we were all gathered together vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the plaine,
ſome two litle miles from the towne, the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
generall thought good not to make attempt
till day light: becauſe there was not one that could
ſerue for guide or giuing knowledge at all of the
place. And therefore after hauing well reſted, euen
halfe an houre before day, he commanded the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
to be deuided into three ſpeciall parts, ſuch as
he appointed, whereas before we had marched by
ſeuerall companies, being thereunto forced by the
naughtineſſe of the way as is aforeſayd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:23483:11"/>
Now by the time we were thus raunged into a
very braue order day light began to appeare, and
being aduaunced hard to the wall, we ſawe no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
to reſiſt, whereupon the Leiutenant generall
appointed Captaine Sampſon with thirtie ſhot, &amp;
Captaine Barton with other thirtie, to goe downe
into the towne which ſtood in the valey vnder-vs,
and might verie plainely be veiwed all ouer from
that place where the whole Army was now arriued
&amp; preſently after theſe Captaines was ſent the great
Enſigne, which had nothing in it but the plaine En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Croſſe, to be placed towardes the ſea, that our
fleet might ſee Saint Georges Croſſe floriſh in the
enemies fortreſſe. Order was giuen that all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
througout the towne and vpon all the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes,
which was aboue fifty peeces all ready char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
ſhould be ſhot of in honor of the Queenes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties
coronation day, being the ſeuententh of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember,
after the yearly cuſtome of England, which
was ſo anſwered againe by the ordinance out of all
the ſhips in the fleete which now was come neere,
as it was ſtraunge to heare ſuch a thondering noiſe
laſt ſo long to gether. In this meane while the Leiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunt
generall held ſtill the moſt part of his force
on the hill top, till ſuch time as the towne was
quartered out for the lodging of the whole armie,
which being done euerie Captaine toke his owne
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23483:11"/>
quarter, and in the euening was placed ſuch ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
gard vpon euerie part of the towne that we had
no cauſe to feare any preſent enemie.</p>
            <p>Thus we continued in the citie the ſpace of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
daies, taking ſuch ſpoiles as the place yelded,
which were for the moſt part, wine, oile, meale, and
ſome other ſuch like things for victuall, as vineger,
oliues &amp; ſome other traſh, as marchandiſe for their
Indian trades. But there was not found any treaſure
at all, or any thing elſe of worth beſides.</p>
            <p>The ſcituation of Sainct IAGO is ſomwhat ſtrange
in forme like to a triangle, hauing on the Eaſt and
VVeſt ſides two mountaines of Rocke and cliffie,
as it were hanging ouer it, vpon the top of which
two mountains was builded certaine fortifications
to preſerue the towne from any harme that might
be offered. From thence on the South ſide of the
towne is the maine ſea, and on the North ſide, the
valley lying betweene the foreſayd mountaines,
wherein the towne ſtandeth: the ſaide valley and
towne both do grow very narrow, inſomuch that
the ſpace betweene the two cliffes of this ende of
the towne is eſtimated not to be aboue tenne or
twelue ſcore ouer.</p>
            <p>In the middeſt of the valley cometh downe a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueret,
rill, or brooke of freſh water, which hard by
the ſea ſide maketh a pond or poole, whereout our
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23483:12"/>
ſhips were watered with very great eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
Somewhat aboue the towne on the North ſide
betweene the two mountaines, the valley wageth
ſomewhat larger then at the townes end, which val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
is wholie conuerted into gardens and orchards
well repleniſhed with diuers ſorts of fruicts, herbes
&amp; trees, as lymmons, oranges, ſuger canes, cochars
or cochos nuts, plantens, potato roots, cocombers,
ſmall and round onions, garlicke, and ſome other
things not now remembred, amongſt which the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chos
nuts and plantens are very pleaſant fruicts, the
ſayd cochos hauing a hard ſhell and a greene huske
ouer it, as hath our walnut, but it farre exceedeth in
greatneſſe, for this cochos in this greene huske is
bigger then any mans two fiſtes, of the hard ſhell
many drinking cups are made here in England, and
ſet in ſiluer as I haue often ſeene.</p>
            <p>Next within this hard ſhell is a white rine reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
in ſhew very much euen as any thing may do,
to the white of an egge when it is hard boyled. And
within this white of the nut lyeth a water, which is
whitiſh and very cleere, to the quantitie of halfe a
pint or thereabouts, which water and white rine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſpoken of, are both of a very coole freſh taſte,
and as pleaſing as any thing may be. I haue heard
ſome hold opinion, that it is very reſtoratiue.</p>
            <p>The Planten groweth in cods, ſomewhat like to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23483:12"/>
beanes, but is bigger and longer, and much more
thicke together on the ſtalke, and when it waxeth
ripe, the meate which filleth the rine of the cod be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
yellow, and is exceeding ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
            <p>In this time of our being there, hapned to come
a Portingall to the VVeſtermoſt fort, with a flag of
truce, to whom Captaine Sampſon was ſent with
Captaine Goring, who comming to the ſayd Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger,
he firſt asked them what nation they were,
they aunſwered Engliſhmen, he then required to
know if warres were betweene England &amp; Spaine,
to which they anſwered that they knew not, but if
he would go to their Generall he could beſt reſolue
him of ſuch particulars, and for his aſſurance of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
and repaſſage, theſe Captaines made offer to
ingage their credits, which he refuſed for that he
was not ſent from his Gouernor. Then they tolde
him, if his Gouernor did deſire to take a courſe for
the common benefit of the people and contrie, his
beſt way were to come &amp; preſent himſelfe vnto our
Noble and merciful Gouernor Sir Frances Drake:
whereby he might be aſſured to finde fauour, both
for him ſelfe and the inhabitants. Otherwiſe within
three daies we ſhould march ouer the land, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
with fire all inhabited places, and put to the
ſworde all ſuch liuing ſoules as we ſhould chaunce
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23483:13"/>
vpon: ſo thus much he tooke for the concluſion of
his anſwer, and departing, he promiſed to returne
the next day, but we neuer heard more of him.</p>
            <p>Vpon the foure and twentieth of Nouember, the
Generall accompanied with the Lieutenant gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and ſix hundred men, marched foorth to a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
twelue miles within the lande, called S. DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINGO,
where the Gouernor and the Biſhop with
all the better ſort were lodged, and by eight of the
clocke we came to it, finding the place abandoned,
&amp; the people fled into the mountaines: ſo we made
ſtande a while to eaſe our ſelues, and partly to ſee if
any would come to ſpeake to vs. After we had well
reſted our ſelues, the Generall commaunded the
troupes to march away homewardes, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the enemy ſhewed them ſelues, both horſe &amp;
foote, though not ſuch force as durſt encounter vs:
and ſo in paſſing ſome time at the gaſe with them, it
waxed late and towards night, before we could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
home to S. IAGO.</p>
            <p>On Munday the ſix &amp; twentieth of Nouember,
the Generall commanded all the Pinnaces with the
boates, to vſe all diligence to imbarke the Armie
into ſuch ſhips as euery man belonged. The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

Captaine Sampſon tooke the priſoner, and willed
him to ſhewe that he had promiſed, the which he

the ruining of their towne at the going away. The
cauſe of this their vnreaſonable diſtruſt (as I do take
it) was the freſh remembrance of the great wrongs
they had done to olde Maiſter VVilliam Hawkins
of Plimouth, in the voyage he made fower or fiue
yeares before, when as they did both breake their
promiſe, and murdered many of his men, whereof
I iudge you haue vnderſtood, and therefore neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
to be here repeated. But ſince they came not
at vs, we left written in ſundry places, as alſo in the
Spitle houſe (which building was onely appointed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23483:16"/>
to be ſpared) the great diſcontentment and ſcorne
we tooke at this their refraining to come vnto vs, as
alſo at the rude maner of killing, and ſauage kind of
handling the dead body of one of our boyes, found
by them ſtragling all alone, from whom they had
taken his head and his heart, and had ſtragled the
other bowels about the place, in a moſt brutiſh and
moſt beaſtly maner.</p>
            <p>In reuenge whereof at our departing we conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with fire all the houſes, aſwell in the countrey
which we ſawe, as in the towne of S. IAGO.</p>
            <p>From hence putting ouer to the VVeſt Indies,
we were not many dayes at ſea, but there beganne
amongſt our people ſuch mortalitie, as in few daies
there were dead aboue two or three hundred men.
And vntil ſome ſeuen or eight dayes after our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from S. IAGO, there had not died anie one
man of ſickeneſſe in all the Fleete: the ſickeneſſe
ſhewed not his infection wherewith ſo many were
ſtroken, vntill we were departed thence, and then
ſeazed our people with extreme hote burning and
continuall ague, whereof ſome verie fevve eſcaped
vvith life, and yet thoſe for the moſt part not vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great alteration and decay of their vvittes and
ſtrength for a long time after. In ſome that dyed
vvere plainely ſhevved the ſmall ſpottes, vvhich are
often found vpon thoſe that be infected vvith the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23483:17"/>
plague, we were not aboue eighteene daies in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
betweene the ſight of Sainct IAGO aforeſaid,
and the Iſland of DOMINICA, being the firſt Iſland
of the VVeſt Indies that we fell withall, the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inhabited with ſauage people, which goe all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
their skin couloured with ſome painting of a
reddiſh tawney, verie perſonable and handſome
ſtrong men, who doe admit little conuerſation with
the Spaniards: for as ſome of our people might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
them, they had a Spaniard or twaine priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with them, neither doe I thinke that there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſafety for any of our nation, or any other to be
within the limits of their commaundement, albeit
they vſed vs very kindely for thoſe fewe houres of
time which we ſpent with them, helping our folkes
to fill and carie on their bare ſhoulders freſh water
from the riuer to our ſhips boats, and fetching from
their houſes, great ſtore of Tobacco, as alſo a kinde
of bread, which they fed on, called Caſſado, verie
white and ſauerie, made of the rootes of Caſſania.
In recompence whereof, we beſtowed liberali re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
of glaſſe, coloured beades and other things,
which we had found at Sainct IAGO, wherewith (as
it ſeemed) they reſted very greatly ſatisfied, and
ſhewing ſome ſorowfull countenance when they
perceaued that we would depart.</p>
            <p>From hence we went to another Iſland VVeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23483:17"/>
of it, called Sainct CHRISTOPHERS Iſland,
wherein we ſpent ſome dayes of Chriſtmas, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
our ſicke people, and to cleanſe and aire our
ſhips. In which Iſland were not any people at all that
we could heare of.</p>
            <p>In which time by the General it was aduiſed and
reſolued, with the conſent of the Lieutenant gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
the Vizeadmirall, and all the reſt of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
to proceede to the great Iſland of HISPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIOLA,
as well for that we knewe our ſelues then
to be in our beſt ſtrength, as alſo the rather allured
thereunto, by the glorious fame of the Citie of S.
DOMINGO, being the auncienteſt and chiefe inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
place in all that tract of country there abouts.
And ſo proceeding in this determination, by the
way we met with a ſmall Frigot, bound for the ſame
place, the which the Vizeadmirall tooke, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
duly examined the men that were in her, there
was one found by whom we were aduertiſed, the
hauen to be a barred hauen, and the ſhore or lande
thereof to be well fortified, hauing a Caſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
furniſhed with great ſtore of artillerie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the daunger whereof, was no conuenient lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
place with ten Engliſh miles of the Citie, to
which the ſayd Pilote tooke on him to conduct vs.</p>
            <p>All things being thus conſidered on, the whole
forces were commaunded in the euening to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barke
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23483:18"/>
them ſelues into Pinnaces, boates, and other
ſmall barkes appointed for this ſeruice. Our ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
being thus imbarked, the Generall put him
ſelfe into the barke Fraunces as Admirall, and all
this night we lay on the ſea, bearing ſmall ſaile vntil
our arriuall to the landing place, which was about
the breaking of the day, and ſo we landed, being
New yeares day, nine or tenne miles to the VVeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
of that braue Citie of S. DOMINGO: for at
that time nor yet is known to vs, any landing place,
where the ſea ſurge doth not threaten to ouerſet a
Pinnace or boate. Our Generall hauing ſeene vs all
landed in ſafetie, returned to his Fleete, bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
vs to God, and the good conduct of Maiſter
Carleill our Lieutenant generall, at which time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about eight of the clocke, we began to march,
and about noone time, or towards one of the clock
we approched the towne, where the Gentlemen
and thoſe of the better ſorte, being ſome hundred
and fiftie braue horſes or rather more, began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
them ſelues, but our ſmall ſhot played vpon
them, which were ſo ſuſtained with good propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of pikes in all partes, as they finding no part of
our troope vnprepared to receaue them (for you
muſt vnderſtand they viewed all round about) they
were thus driuen to giue vs leaue to proceede to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
the two gates of the towne, which were the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23483:18"/>
next to the ſeaward. They had manned them both,
and planted their ordinance for that preſent and
ſudden alarum without the gates, and alſo ſome
troopes of ſmall ſhot in Ambuſcado vpon the high
way ſide. VVe deuided our whole force, being
ſome thouſand or twelue hundred men into two
partes, to enterpriſe both the gates at one inſtant,
the Lieutenant generall hauing openly vowed to
Captaine Powell (who led the troope that entred
by the other gate) that with Gods good fauour he
would not reſt vntill our meeting in the market
place.</p>
            <p>Their ordinance had no ſooner diſcharged vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our neere approche, and made ſome execution
amongeſt vs, though not much, but the Leiutenant
generall beganne forthwith to aduaunce both his
voice of encoragment and paſe of marching, the
firſt man that was ſlaine with the ordinaunce being
verie neere vnto him ſelfe, and thereupon haſted
all that he might to keepe them from the reaching
of the ordinaunce. And notwithſtanding their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcadoes,
we marched or rather ranne ſoe roundly
into them, as pell mell we entered the gates with
them, and gaue them more care euerie man to ſaue
himſelfe by flight, then reaſon to ſtand any longer
to their broken fight, we forthwith repaired to the
market place, but to be more truely vnderſtood
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23483:19"/>
a place of very faire ſpatious ſquare ground before
the great Church, whither alſo came as had beene
agreed, Captaine Powell with the other troope,
which place with ſome part next vnto it we ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
with Barricados, &amp; there as the moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
place aſſured our ſelues, the Citie being farre
too ſpatious for ſo ſmall and wearie a troope to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to gard. Somwhat after midnight they who
had the gard of the Caſtle, hearing vs buſie about
the gates of the ſaid Caſtle, abandoned the ſame,
ſome being taken priſoners, and ſome flying away
by the helpe of boates, to the other ſide of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and ſoe into the countrey.</p>
            <p>The next day we quartered alitle more at large,
but not in the halfe part of the towne, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſubſtantiall trenches, and planting all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce,
that each parte was correſpondent to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we held this towne the ſpace of one moneth.</p>
            <p>In the which time hapned ſome accidents more
then are well remembred for the preſent, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt
other thinges it chaunced that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſent on his meſſage to the Spaniardes a negro
boy with a flagge of white, ſignifying truce as is the
Spaniards ordinarie maner to do there, when they
approch to ſpeake with vs, which boy vnhappily
was firſt met withal, by ſome of thoſe who had bene
belonging as officers for the king in the Spaniſh
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23483:19"/>
galley, which with the towne was lately fallen into
our hands, who without all order or reaſon, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that good vſage wherewith we had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
their meſſengers, furiouſlie ſtroke the poore
boy through the body with one of their horſemens
ſtaues, with which wound the boy returned to the
Generall, and after he had declared the maner of
this wrongfull crueltie, died forthwith in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
wherewith the Generall being greatly paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
commanded the Prouoſt martiall, to cauſe a
couple of Friers, then priſoners, to be caried to the
ſame place where the boy was ſtroken, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with ſufficient gard of our ſouldiers, and there
preſently to be hanged, diſpatching at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
another poore priſoner, with this reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this execution was done, and with this meſſage
further, that vntill the partie who had thus murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Generals meſſenger, were deliuered into
our hands, to receaue condigne puniſhment, there
ſhould no day paſſe, wherein there ſhould not two
priſoners be hanged, vntill they were all conſumed
which were in our hands.</p>
            <p>VVhereupon the day folowing, he that had bene
Captaine of the kings galley, brought the offendor
to the townes ende, offring to deliuer him into our
hands, but it was thought a more honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
to make them there in our ſight, to performe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23483:20"/>
the execution them ſelues, which was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>During our being in this towne, as formerly alſo
at S. IAGO there had paſſed iuſtice vpon the life of
one of our owne companie for an odious matter: ſo
here likewiſe was there an Iriſh man hanged, for
the murthering of his Corporall.</p>
            <p>In this time alſo paſſed many treaties betweene
their commiſſioners and vs, for ranſome of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but vpon diſagreements, we ſtill ſpent the early
mornings in firing the outmoſt houſes: but they
being built very magnificently of ſtone, with high
loftes, gaue vs no ſmall trauell to ruine them. And
albeit for diuers dayes together, we ordained eche
morning by day breake, vntill the heate began at
nine of the clocke, that two hundred mariners did
nought elſe but labour to fier and burne the ſayd
houſes without our trenches, whileſt the ſouldiers
in a like proportion ſtood foorth for their gard: yet
did we not or could not in this time conſume ſo
much as one third part of the towne. And ſo in the
end, what wearied with firing, and what haſtened by
ſome other reſpects, we were content to accept of
fiue and twentie thouſand Duckets, of fiue ſhillings
ſixe pence the peece, for the raunſome of the reſt of
the towne. Amongſt other things which happened
and were found at S. DOMINGO, I may not omit to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23483:20"/>
let the world know one very notable marke and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
of the vnſatiable ambition of the Spaniſh King
and his nation, which was found in the kings houſe,
wherein the chiefe Gouernour of that Citie and
countrey is appointed always to lodge, which was
this. In the comming to the hall or other roomes of
this houſe, you muſt firſt aſcend vp by a faire large
paire of ſtaires, at the head of which ſtaires is a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſpatious place to walke in, ſomewhat like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a gallerie, wherein vpon one of the walles, right
ouer againſt you as you enter the ſayd place, ſo as
your eye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not eſcape the ſight of it, there is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
&amp; painted in a very large Scutchion, the armes
of the king of Spaine, &amp; in the lower part of the ſaid
Scutchion, there is likewiſe deſcribed a globe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
in it the whole circuite of the ſea and the
earth, whereupon is a horſe ſtanding on his hinder
part within the globe, and the other fore part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the globe, lifted vp as it were to leape, with a
ſcroll painted in his mouth, wherein was written
theſe wordes in Latin NON SVFFICIT ORBIS:
which is as much to ſay, as the world ſuffiſeth not,
whereof the meaning was required to be knowne
of ſome of thoſe of the better ſort, that came in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to treate vpon the ranſome of the towne,
who would ſhake their heads, and turne aſide their
countenance in ſome ſmiling ſort, without aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23483:21"/>
any thing, as greatly aſhamed thereof. For by
ſome of our companie it was told them, that if the
Queene of England would reſolutely proſecute the
warres againſt the king of Spaine, he ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to lay aſide that proude and vnreaſonable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
vaine of his, for he ſhould finde more then
inough to do, to keepe that which he had alreadie,
as by the preſent example of their loſt towne they
might for a beginning perceaue well inough.</p>
            <p>Now to the ſatisfying of ſome men, who maruell
greatly that ſuch a famous &amp; goodly builded Citie
ſo wel inhabited of gallant people, very brauely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled
(whereof our ſouldiers found good ſtore
for their reliefe) ſhould afoord no greater riches
then was found there, wherein it is to be vnderſtood
that the Indian people, which were the naturals of
this whole Iſland of HISPANIOLA (the ſame being
neare hand as great as England) were many yeares
ſince cleane conſumed by the tyrannie of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,
which was cauſe, that for lacke of people to
worke in the Mines, the gold &amp; ſiluer Mines of this
Iſland are wholie giuen ouer, and thereby they are
faine in this Iſland to vſe copper money, whereof
was found verie great quantitie. The chiefe trade of
this place conſiſteth of ſuger &amp; ginger, which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the Iſland, and of hides of oxen and kine,
which in this waſt countrey of the Iſland are bred

wine pipes and other caske, and other commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
likewiſe, as wollen and linnen cloth, and ſome
ſilkes, all which prouiſions are brought out of Spain
and ſerued vs for great releefe. There was but litle
plate or veſſell of ſiluer, in compariſon of the great
pride in other things of this towne, becauſe in theſe
hote countreyes they vſe much of theſe earthen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
finely painted or varniſhed, which they call
Parſellina, and is had out of the Eaſt India, and for

place. But yet ſome plate we found, and many other
good things, as their houſhold garniture very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
and rich, which had coſt them deare, although
vnto vs they were of ſmall importance.</p>
            <p>From S. DOMINGO we put ouer to the maine
or firme land, and going all alongeſt the coaſt, we
came at the laſt in ſight of CARTAGENA, ſtanding
vpon the ſea ſide, ſo neare as ſome of our barkes in
paſſing alongeſt, approched within the reach of
their Culuerin ſhot, which they had planted vpon
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23483:24"/>
certaine platformes. The harbour mouth lay ſome
fiue miles to the VVeſtward of the towne, wherinto
we entred about three or foure of the clocke in the
after noone without any reſiſtance, or ordinance or
other impeachment planted vpon the ſame. In the
euening we put our ſelues on land towards the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
mouth, vnder the lea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing of Maiſter Carleill
our Lieutenant generall, who after he had digeſted
vs to march forward about the midnight, as eaſily
as foot might fall, expreſſely commanding to keepe
cloſe by the ſea waſh of the ſhore for our beſt and
ſureſt way, whereby we were like to go through, and
not to miſſe any more of the way, which once we
had loſt within an hower after our firſt beginning to

toke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to be our guide, wherby the night ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
on, which otherwiſe muſt haue bene done by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.
But as we came within two miles of the town,
their horſemen which were ſome hundred, met vs,
and taking the Alarum, retired to their towneward
againe vpon the firſt volley of our ſhot that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
them: for the place where we encountred being
woodie and buſhie euen to the water ſide, was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete
for their ſeruice.</p>
            <p>At this inſtant we might heare ſome peeces of

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23483:24"/>
to the order ſet downe in the euening before
by our Generall, that the Vizeadmirall accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied

Captaine Croſſe, with other ſea Captaines, and
with diuers Pinnaces and boates ſhould giue ſome
attempt vnto the litle fort ſtanding on the entrie of
the inner hauen, neare adioyning to the towne,
though to ſmall purpoſe, for that the place was
ſtrong, and the entrie very narrow was chained o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
ſo as there could be nothing gotten by that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
more then the giuing them an Alarum on
that other ſide of the hauen, being a mile or two
from the place where we nowe were. In which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the Vizeadmirall had the rudder of his Skiffe
ſtroken through with a Saker ſhot, and litle or no
harme receaued elſewhere.</p>
            <p>The troopes being nowe in their march halfe a
mile behither the towne or leſſe, the ground we
were on grewe to be ſtraight, and not aboue fiftie
paſes ouer, hauing the maine ſea on the one ſide of
it, and the harbour water or inner ſea (as you may
tearme it) on the other ſide. This ſtraight was forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
cleane ouer with a ſtone wall and a ditch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, the ſaid wall being as orderly built with flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in euery part, as can be ſet downe. There was
onely ſo much of this ſtraight vnwalled, as might
ſerue for the iſſuing of the horſemen, or the paſſing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23483:25"/>
of cariage in time of neede: but this vnwalled part
was not without a very good Barricado of wine
buts or pipes, filled with earth, full and thick as they
might ſtand on end one by other ſome part of them
ſtanding euen within the maine ſea.</p>
            <p>This place of ſtrength was furniſhed of ſixe great
peeces, demi-Culuerins and Sakers, which ſhot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
in front vpon vs as vve approched. Novve
without this wall vpon the inner ſide of the ſtraight,
they had brought likewiſe two great gallies with
their proweſſe to the ſhore, hauing planted in them
eleuen peeces of ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which did beat all croſſe
the ſtraight, and flanked our comming on. In theſe
two galleyes wered planted three or foure hundred
ſmall ſhot, and on the land in the gard onely of this

            <p>They in this their full readineſſe to receaue vs,
ſpared not their ſhot both great and ſmall. But our

by the loweſt ground, according to the
expreſſe direction which him ſelfe had formerly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
the ſame being the ſea waſh ſhore, where the

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23483:25"/>
together we approched the place, where we ſoone
found out the Barricadoes of pipes or buts, to be
the meeteſt place for our aſſault, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it was well furniſhed with pikes and ſhot, was
without ſtaying attempted by vs: downe went the
buts of earth, and pell mell came our ſwordes and
pikes together, after our ſhot had firſt giuen their
volley, euen at the enemies noſe. Our pikes were
ſomewhat longer then theirs, and our bodies better
armed, for very fewe of them were armed, with
which aduantage our ſwordes and pikes grewe to
hard for them, and they driuen to giue place. In
this furious entrie, the Lieutenant generall ſlue with
his owne hands, the chief enſigne bearer of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,
who fought very manfully to his liues end.</p>
            <p>VVe followed into the towne with them, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
them no leaſure to breath, we wanne the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
place, albeit they made head, and fought a while
before we got it, and ſo we being once ſeazed and
aſſured of that, they were content to ſuffer vs to
lodge within their towne, and them ſelues to go to
their wiues, whom they had caried into other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the countrey before our comming thither.</p>
            <p>At euerie ſtreetes end they had raiſed very fine
Barricadoes of earth workes, with trenches without
them, as well made as euer we ſaw any worke done:
at the entring whereof was ſome litle reſiſtance, but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23483:26"/>
ſoone ouercome, it was with few ſlaine or hurt. They
had ioyned with them many Indians, whom they
had placed in corners of aduantage, all bowe men,
with their arrowes moſt villanouſly empoiſoned, ſo
as if they did but breake the skinne, the partie ſo
touched died without great maruell: ſome they ſlue
of our people with their arrowes, ſome they likewiſe
miſchieued to death with certaine prickes or ſmall
ſtickes ſharply pointed, of a foote and a halfe long,
the one end put into the ground, the other empoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,
ſticking faſt vp, right againſt our comming
in the way, as we ſhould approch from our landing
towardes the towne, whereof they had planted a
wonderfull number in the ordinarie way, but our
keeping the ſea waſh ſhore, miſſed the greateſt part
of them very happily.</p>
            <p>To ouerpaſſe many particular matters, as the
hurting of Captaine Sampſon at ſword blowes in
the firſt entring, vnto whom was committed the
charge of the pikes of the Vantgard by his lot and
turne, as alſo of the taking of Alonſo Brauo the
chiefe commander of that place by Captaine Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
after the ſayd Captaine had firſt hurt him with
his ſword, vnto which Captaine was committed the
charge of the ſhot of the ſaid Vantgard.</p>
            <p>Captaine VVinter was likewiſe by his turne of
the Vantgard in this attempt, where alſo the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23483:26"/>
generall marched him ſelfe, the ſayd Captaine
VVinter through a great deſire to ſerue by land, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
now exchaunged his charge by ſea with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Cecill for his band of footemen.</p>
            <p>Captaine Powell the Sergeant maior had by his
turne, the charge of the foure companies which
made the battaile.</p>
            <p>Captaine Morgan, who at S. DOMINGO was of
the Vantgard, had nowe by turne his charge vpon
the companies of the Riergard.</p>
            <p>Euerie man aſwell of one part as of another,
came ſo willingly on to the ſeruice, as the enemie
was not able to endure the furie of ſuch hote aſſault.
VVe ſtayed here ſixe weekes, &amp; the ſickeneſſe with
mortality before ſpoken of, ſtill continuing among
vs, though not with the ſame furie as at the firſt, and
ſuch as were touched with the ſaid ſickeneſſe, eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
death, very few or none almoſt could recouer
againe their ſtrength, yea many of them were much
decayed in their memorie, inſomuch that it was
grovven an ordinarie iudgement, vvhen one vvas
heard to ſpeake fooliſhly, to ſay he had bene ſicke
of the Calentour, vvhich is the Spaniſh name of
their burning ague: for as I told you before, it is a
verie burning &amp; peſtilent ague. The originall cauſe
thereof, is imputed to the euening or firſt night aire
which they tearme La ſerena, vvherein they ſay and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:23483:27"/>
hold very firme opinion, that who ſo is then abroad
in the open aire, ſhall certainly be infected to the
death, not being of the Indian or naturall race of
thoſe countrey people: our people by holding their
watch, were thus ſubiected to the infectious aire,
which at S. IAGO was moſt daungerous and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of all other places.</p>
            <p>VVith this inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience of continuall mortality,
we were forced to giue ouer our inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded enterpriſe,
to go with NOMBRE DE DIOS, and ſo ouerland
to PANNANIA, where we ſhoulde haue ſtroken
the ſtroke for the treaſure, and full recompence of
our tediouſe trauailes. And thus at CARTAGENA
we toke our firſt reſolution to returne homewards.</p>
            <p>But while we were yet there, it happened one
day, that our watch called the Sentinell, vpon the
Church ſteeple, had diſcouered in the ſea a couple
of ſmall barkes or boates, making in with the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of CARTAGENA, wherepo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Captaine Moone
and Captaine Varney, with Iohn Grant the Maiſter
of the Tyger, and ſome other ſeamen, embarqued
them ſelues in a couple of ſmall Pinnaces, to take
them before they ſhould come neare the ſhore, at
the mouth of the harbour, leſt by ſome ſtragling
Spaniards from the land, they might be warned by
ſignes from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in, which fell out accordingly,
notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding al the diligence that our men could
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:23483:27"/>
vſe: for the Spaniſh boates, vpon the ſight of our
Pinnaces comming towards them, ran themſelues
a ſhore, and ſo their men preſently hid them ſelues
in the buſhes hard by the ſea ſide, amongeſt ſome
others that had called them by ſignes thither. Our
men preſently without any due regard had to the
qualitie of the place, and ſeeing no man of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
to ſhew them ſelues, aboorded the Spaniſh
barkes or boates, and ſo ſtanding all open in them,
were ſuddenly ſhot at by a troope of Spaniards out
of the buſhes, by which volley of ſhot there were
ſlaine Captaine Varney, who died preſently, and
Captaine Moone, who died ſome fewe dayes after,
beſides ſome foure or fiue others that were hurt: &amp;
ſo our folkes returned without their purpoſe, not
hauing anie ſufficient number of ſouldiers, with
them to fight on ſhore. For thoſe men they carried
were all marriners to rowe, fewe of them armed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they made accompt with their ordinance to
haue taken the barks well inough at ſea, which they
might full eaſily haue done, without any loſſe at all,
if they had come in time to the harbour mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Spaniards boates had gotten ſo neare the
ſhore.</p>
            <p>During our abode in this place, as alſo a S. DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINGO,
there paſſed diuerſe curteſies betweene vs
and the Spaniards, as feaſting, and vſing them with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:23483:28"/>
all kindneſſe and fauour: ſo as amongſt others there
came to ſee the Generall, the Gouernour of CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAGENA,
with the Biſhop of the ſame, and diuerſe
other Gentlemen of the better ſort.</p>
            <p>This towne of CARTAGENA we touched in the
out parts, and conſumed much with fire, as we had
done S. DOMINGO vpon diſcontentments, and
for want of agreeing with vs in their firſt treaties
touching their ranſome, which at the laſt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
betweene vs, ſhould be a hundred and ten
thouſand Duckets for that which was yet ſtanding,
the Ducket valued at fiue ſhillings ſixe pence ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge.</p>
            <p>This towne (though not halfe ſo bigge as S. DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINGO)
giues as you ſee, a farre greater ranſome,
being in very deede of farre more importance, by
reaſon of the excellencie of the harbour, and the fit
ſituation thereof, to ſerue the trade of NOMBRE
DE DIOS and other places, and is inhabited with
farre more rich merchants. The other is chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
with Lawyers and braue Gentlemen, being
the chiefe or higheſt appeale of their ſutes in law of
all the Iſlands about it, and of the maine land coaſt
next vnto it. And it is of no ſuch accompt as CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAGENA,
for theſe and ſome other like reaſons,
which I could giue you, ouer long to be now writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>The warning which this towne receaued of our
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23483:28"/>
comming towards them, from S. DOMINGO, by
the ſpace of twentie dayes before our ariuall hither,
was cauſe that they had both fortified &amp; euery way
prepared for their beſt defence. As alſo that they
had caried &amp; conueyed away all their treaſure and
principall ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>The ranſome of an hundred and ten thouſand
Duckets thus concluded on, as is aforeſayd, the
ſame being written, &amp; expreſſing for nothing more
then the towne of CARTAGENA, vpon the paiment
of the ſayd ranſome, we left the ſayd towne, and
drewe ſome part of our ſouldiers into the Priorie or
Abbey, ſtanding a quarter of an Engliſh mile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
the towne vpon the harbour water ſide, the
ſame being walled with a wall of ſtone, which we
told the Spaniards was yet ours, and not redeemed
by their compoſition: where upon they finding the
defect of their contract, were content to enter into
onother raunſome for all places, but ſpecially for
the ſayd houſe, as alſo the blocke houſe or Caſtle,
which is vpon the mouth of the inner harbour. And
when we asked as much for the one as for the other,
they yeelded to giue a thouſand crownes for the
Abbey, leauing vs to take our pleaſure vpon the
blocke houſe, which they ſayd they were not able
to raunſome, hauing ſtretched them ſelues to the
vttermoſt of their powers: and therefore the ſayd
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:23483:29"/>
blocke houſe was by vs vndermined, and ſo with
gun pouder blowen vp in peeces.</p>
            <p>VVhile this latter contract was in making, our
whole Fleete of ſhips fell downe towards the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
mouth, where they ankered the third time, &amp;
employed their men in fetching of freſh water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord
the ſhips for our voyage homewardes, which
water was had in a great well, that is in the Iſland by
the harbour mouth, which Iſland is a verie pleaſant
place as hath bene ſeene, hauing in it manie ſorts of
goodly and very pleaſant fruits, as the orenge trees
and others, being ſet orderly in walkes of great
length together. Inſomuch as the whole Iſland be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome two or three miles about, is caſt into
groundes of gardening and orchards.</p>
            <p>After ſixe weekes abode in this place, we put to
ſea the laſt of March, where after two or three dayes
a great ſhip which we had taken at S. DOMINGO,
and thereupon was called the New yeares gift, fell
into a great leake, being laden with ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, hides,
and other ſpoiles, and in the night ſhe loſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
of our Fleete, which being miſſed the next
morning by the Generall, he caſt about with the
whole Fleete, fearing ſome great miſchaunce to be
happened vnto her, as in verie deede it ſo fell out,
for her leake was ſo great, and her men were all ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with pomping. But at the laſt hauing found her
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23483:29"/>
and the Barke Talbot in her companie, which ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by great hap with her, was readie to take their
men out of her, for the ſauing of them. And ſo the
Generall being fully aduertiſed of their great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
made ſaile directly backe againe to CARTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GENA
with the whole Fleete, where hauing ſtayed
eight or tenne dayes more, about the vnlading of
this ſhip, and the beſtowing thereof and her men,
into other ſhips, we departed once againe to ſea,
directing our courſe towards the Cape S. ANTHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIE,
being the Eaſtermoſt part of CVBA, whither
we arriued the ſeuen &amp; twentieth of Aprill. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
freſh water could not preſently be found, we
weyed anker and departed, thinking in fewe dayes
to recouer the MATTANCES, a place to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of HAVANA.</p>
            <p>After we had ſailed ſome fourteene dayes, we
were brought to Cape S. ANTHONIE againe, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
lacke of fauorable wind: but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſcarſitie
was growen ſuch, as neede made vs looke a litle
better for water, which we found in ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie,
being in deede, as I iudge, none other then
raine water newly fallen, and gathered vp by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
pittes in a plot of marriſh ground, ſome three
hundred paſes from the ſea ſide.</p>
            <p>I do wrong if I ſhould forget the good example
of the Generall at this place, who to encourage
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:23483:30"/>
others, and to haſten the getting of freſh water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord
the ſhips, tooke no leſſe paine him ſelfe then
the meaneſt, as alſo at S. DOMINGO, CARTAGENA
and all other places, hauing alwayes ſo vigilant a
care and foreſight in the good ordering of his fleet,
accompanying them, as it is ſayd, with ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
trauell of bodie, as doubtleſſe had he bene
the meaneſt perſon, as he was the chiefeſt, he had
yet deſerued the firſt place of honour: and no leſſe
happie do we accompt him, for being aſſociated
with Maiſter Carleill his Lieutenant generall, by
whoſe experience, prudent counſell, and gallant
performance, he atchiued ſo many and happie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes
of the warre, by whom alſo he was verie
greatly aſſiſted, in ſetting downe the needefull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
lawes, and courſe of iuſtice, and for the due
adminiſtration of the ſame vpon all occaſions.</p>
            <p>After three dayes ſpent in watering our ſhips, we
departed now the ſecond time from this Cape of S.
ANTHONIE the thirteenth of May, and proceeding
about the Cape of FLORIDA, we neuer touched
anie where, but coaſting alongſt FLORIDA, and
keeping the ſhore ſtill in ſight, the eight and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
of May early in the morning, we deſcried on
the ſhore a place built like a Beacon, which was in
deede a ſcaffold vpon foure long maſtes, raiſed on
ende for men to diſcouer to the ſeaward, being in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23483:30"/>
the latitude of thirtie degrees, or verie neare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
Our Pinnaces manned, and comming to the
ſhore, we marched vp alongſt the riuer ſide, to ſee
what place the enemy held there: for none amongſt
vs had any knowledge thereof at all.</p>
            <p>Here the General tooke occaſion to march with
the companies him ſelfe in perſon, the Lieutenant
generall hauing the Vantgard, and going a mile vp
or ſomewhat more by the riuer ſide, we might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne
on the other ſide of the riuer ouer againſt vs,
a fort, which newly had bene built by the Spaniards,
and ſome mile or there about aboue the fort, was a
litle towne or village without walles, built of wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
houſes: we forthwith prepared to haue ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for the batterie, and one peece was litle
before the euening planted, and the firſt ſhot being
made by the Lieutenant generall him ſelfe at their
Enſigne, ſtrake through the Enſigne, as we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
vnderſtood by a French man, which came
vnto vs from them. One ſhot more was then made,
which ſtrake the foote of the fort wall, which was all
maſſiue timber of great trees like maſtes. The Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
generall was determined to paſſe the riuer
this night with foure companies, and there to lodge
him ſelfe intrenched as neare the fort, as that he
might play with his muskets and ſmalleſt ſhot vpon
anie that ſhould appeare: and ſo afterwards to bring
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:23483:31"/>
and plant the batterie with him, but the helpe of
marriners for that ſudden to make trenches could
not be had, which was the cauſe that this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
was remitted vntill the next night.</p>
            <p>In the night the Lieutenant general tooke a litle
rowing Skiffe, and halfe a doſen well armed, as
Captaine Morgan, and Captaine Sampſon, with
ſome others beſides the rowers, and went to viewe
what gard the enemie kept, as alſo to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the ground. And albeit he went as couertly
as might be, yet the enemy taking the Alarum, grew
fearefull that the whole Force was approching to
the aſſault, and therefore with all ſpeede abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the place after the ſhooting of ſome of their
pecces. They thus gone, and he being returned
vnto vs againe, but nothing knowing of their flight
from their fort, forthwith came a French man being
a Phipher (who had bene priſoner with them) in a
litle boate, playing on his phiph the tune of the
Prince of Orenge his ſong, and being called vnto
by the gard, he tolde them before he put foote out
of the boate, what he was him ſelfe, and howe the
Spaniards were gone from the ſort, offering either
to remaine in hands there, or elſe to returne to the
place with them that would go.</p>
            <p>Vpon this intelligence the Generall, the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
generall, with ſome of the Captaines in one
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:23483:31"/>
Skiffe, and the Vizeadmirall with ſome others in
his Skiffe, and two or three Pinnaces furniſhed of
ſouldiers with them, put preſently ouer towards the
fort, giuing order for the reſt of the Pinnaces to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
And in our approch, ſome of the enemie bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then the reſt, hauing ſtayed behind their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
ſhot off two peeces of ordinance at vs: but
on ſhore we went, and entred the place without fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any man there.</p>
            <p>VVhen the day appeared, we found it built all
of timber, the walles being none other then whole
maſts or bodies of trees ſet vpright and cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in maner of a pale, without anie ditch as yet
made, but who intended with ſome more time, for
they had not as yet finiſhed all their worke, hauing
begun the ſame ſome three or fower moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
ſo as to ſay the truth, they had no reaſon to
keepe it, being ſubiect both to fier and eaſie aſſault.</p>
            <p>The platforme whereon the ordinance lay, was
whole bodies of long pine trees, whereof there is
great plentie, layed a croſſe one on another, and
ſome litle earth amongſt. There was in it thirteene
or fourreene great peeces of braſſe ordinance, and
a cheſt vnbroken vp, hauing in it the value of ſome
two thouſand pounds ſterling, by eſtimation of the
Kings treaſure, to pay the ſouldiers of that place,
who were a hundred and fiftie men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:23483:32"/>
The fort thus wonne, which they called S. Iohns
fort, and the day opened, we aſſayed to go to the
towne, but could not by reaſon of ſome riuers and
broken ground which was betweene the two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
and therefore enforced to imbarke againe into
our Pinnaces, we went thither vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the great maine
riuer, which is called as alſo the towne by the name
of S. AVGVSTINE.</p>
            <p>At our approching to land, there was ſome that
began to ſhewe them ſelues, and to beſtowe ſome
fewe ſhot vpon vs, but preſently withdrewe them
ſelues. And in their running thus away, the Sergeant
maior finding one of their horſes readie ſadled and
bridled, tooke the ſame to follow the chaſe, and ſo
ouergoing all his companie, was (by one layed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
a buſh) ſhot through the head, &amp; falling downe
therewith, was by the ſame and two or three more,
ſtabbed in three or foure places of his bodie with
ſwords and daggers, before anie could come neere
to his reskue. His death was much lamented, being
in verie deede an honeſt wiſe Gentleman, and a
ſouldier of good experience, and of as great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
as anie man might be.</p>
            <p>In this place called S. AVGVSTINE, we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the King did keepe as is before ſaid, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fiftie ſouldiers, and at an other place ſome
dozen leagues beyond to the Northwardes, called

S. HELENA, he did there likewiſe kepe an hundred
and fiftie more, ſeruing there for no other purpoſe,
then to keepe all other nations from inhabiting any
part of all that coaſt, the gouernement wherof was
committed to one Pedro Melendez Marqueſſe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
to that Melendez the Admiral, who had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
Maiſter Iohn Hawkins in the Bay of MEXI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CO
ſome fifteene or ſixteene yeares agoe. This Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
had charge of both the places, but was at
this time in this place, and one of the firſt that left
the ſame.</p>
            <p>Here it was reſolued in full aſſemblie of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
to vndertake the enterpriſe of S. HELENA,
and from thence to ſeeke out the inhabitation of
our Engliſh countrey men in VIRGINIA, diſtant
from thence ſome ſixe degrees Northward.</p>
            <p>VVhen we came thwart of S. HELENA, the ſhols
appearing daungerous, and we hauing no Pilot to
vndertake the entrie, it was thought meeteſt to go
hence alongſt. For the Admirall had bene the ſame
night in foure fadome and halfe three leagues from
the ſhore: and yet we vnderſtood, that by the helpe
of a knowen Pilot, there may and doth go in ſhips
of greater burthen and draught then anie we had in
our Fleete.</p>
            <p>VVe paſſed thus alongeſt the coaſt hard abord
the ſhore, which is ſhallow for a league or two from
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:23483:35"/>
the ſhore, and the ſame is lowe and broken land
for the moſt part.</p>
            <p>The ninth of Iune vpon ſight of one ſpeciall great
fire (which are verie ordinarie all alongſt this coaſt,
euen from the Cape FLORIDA hither) the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
ſent his Skiffe to the ſhore, where they found
ſome of our Engliſh countrey men (that had bene
ſent thither the yeare before by Sir VValter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh)
&amp; brought one aboord, by whoſe direction
we proceeded along to the place, which they make
their Port. But ſome of our ſhips being of great
draught vnable to enter, we ankered all without the
harbour in a wild road at ſea, about two miles from
ſhore.</p>
            <p>From whence the General wrote letters to Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
Rafe Lane, being Gouernour of thoſe Engliſh
in VIRGINIA, and then at his fort about ſix leagues
from the rode in an Iſland, which they call ROA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOAC,
wherein ſpecially he ſhewed how readie he
was to ſupply his neceſſities and wants, which he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of, by thoſe he had firſt talked withall.</p>
            <p>The morrowe after Maiſter Lane him ſelfe and
ſome of his companie comming vnto him, with the
conſent of his Captaines, he gaue them the choiſe
of two offers, that is to ſay: Either he would leaue a
ſhip, a Pinnace, and certaine boates with ſufficient
Maiſters and mariners, together furniſhed witha
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:23483:35"/>
moneths victuall to ſtay and make farther diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the country and coaſtes, and ſo much victuall
likewiſe that might be ſufficient for the bringing of
them all (being an hundred and three perſons) into
England if they thought good after ſuch time, with
anie other thing they would deſire, &amp; that he might
be able to ſpare.</p>
            <p>Or elſe if they thought they had made ſufficient
diſcouerie alreadie, and did deſire to returne into
England, he would giue them paſſage. But they as
it ſeemed, being deſirous to ſtay, accepted verie
thankefully, and with great gladneſſe that which
was offred firſt. VVherupon the ſhip being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
&amp; receaued into charge, by ſome of their owne
companie ſent into her by Maiſter Lane, before
they had receaued from the reſt of the Fleete, the
prouiſion appointed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there aroſe a great ſtorme
(which they ſayde was extraordinarie and verie
ſtraunge) that laſted three dayes together, and
put all our Fleete in great daunger, to be driuen
from their ankering vpon the coaſt. For we brake
manie Cables, and loſt manie ankers. And ſome of
our Fleete which had loſt all (of which number was
the ſhip appointed for Maiſter Lane and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie)
were driuen to put to ſea in great danger, in
auoiding the coaſt, and could neuer ſee vs againe
vntill we met in England. Manie alſo of our ſmall
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:23483:36"/>
Pinnaces and boates were loſt in this ſtorme.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding after all this, the Generall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them (with conſent of his Captaines) another
ſhip with ſome prouiſion, although not ſuch a one
for their turnes, as might haue bene ſpared them
before, this being vnable to be brought into their
harbour. Or elſe if they would, to giue them paſſage
into England, although he knewe he ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it with greater difficultie then he might haue
done before.</p>
            <p>But Maiſter Lane with thoſe of the chiefeſt of
his companie he had then with him, conſidering
what ſhould be beſt for them to doe, made requeſt
vnto the Generall vnder their handes, that they
might haue paſſage for England: the which being
graunted, and the reſt ſent for out of the countrey
and ſhipped, we departed from that coaſt the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of Iune.</p>
            <p>And ſo God be thanked, both they and we in
good ſafetie arriued at Porteſmouth the eight and
twentieth of Iuly 1586. to the great glorie of God,
and to no ſmall honour to our Prince, our countrey
and our ſelues.</p>
            <p>The totall value of that which was gotten in this
voyage, is eſtimated at three ſcore thouſand pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,
whereof the companies which haue trauelled in the
