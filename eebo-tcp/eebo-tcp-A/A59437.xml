            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Favour which your Lordship was
pleased to shew to this Play, I value
more than all the loud Applauses of a <hi>Theater:</hi>
Nor can it be less esteemed by any man that has
had the honour of knowing your Lordships
Person, or the pleasure of reading the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of your pen. It seems by your obliging
kindness to the Poets, and your great example
in writing, as if you were design'd by Heaven,
among many other great uses, for the sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of declining Poetry. This consideration,
with the boldness which your frequent favours
<pb facs="tcp:57902:3"/>
have given me, pull the trouble of this Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
upon you. You see, my Lord, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of encouraging any of us, who are too apt
without it to use the names of great men for the
defence of our weaknesses and follies; nay, some
are so arrogant to believe their injurious Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
competent returns for all the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they receive from the generosity of their
Patrons. But I, my Lord, have been too much
obliged by you to think of making any return:
all that I can do, is to beg leave to make an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
acknowledgment of all your favours; and to
take this occasion to publish my self to the
World,</p>

            <p>THE Foundation of this Play I took
from one of <hi>Moliere's</hi> called <hi>L' Avare;</hi>
but that having too few persons, and too little
action for an <hi>English Theater,</hi> I added to both
so much, that I may call more than half of
this Play my own: and <hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi> may say with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vanity, that <hi>Moliere's</hi> part of it has not
suffer'd in my hands, nor did <hi>I</hi> ever know a
<hi>French</hi> Comedy made use of by the worst of
our Poets, that was not better'd by 'em. 'Tis
not barrenness of wit or invention, that makes us
borrow from the <hi>French,</hi> but laziness; and this
was the occasion of my making use of
<hi>L' Avare.</hi> This Play, as it was wrote in less than
a moneth, and was the last Play that was Acted
at the Kings Theater in <hi>Covent-garden,</hi> before
the fatal fire there; the great hast I made in
writing it, that made me very doubtful of the
success of it, which was the reason that at
first <hi>I</hi> did not own it, but conceal'd my
Name. <hi>I</hi> have resolved to take my leave of
long Prefaces, and will give you no farther trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
here, for fear you should find too much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>

            <l>OUR Poet never doubts the good success</l>
            <l>Of Farce that's in half <hi>French,</hi> half <hi>English</hi> dress:</l>
            <l>And this was made with little pains and wit,</l>
            <l>As any cobling Poet e're wrote yet,</l>
            <l>And therefore he's resolv'd not to submit.</l>
            <l>The Fortune of his Fellows he has seen,</l>
            <l>Who in dull Farce have so successful been,</l>
            <l>That could he write true wit, he is in doubt</l>
            <l>Whether you would endure to sit it out.</l>
            <l>But though he has no wit, he has some shame,</l>
            <l>And stealing from the <hi>French</hi> conceals his name.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>French</hi> Plays, in which true wit's as rarely found</l>
            <l>As Mines of Silver are in <hi>English</hi> ground;</l>
            <l>A foolish Marquiss, or his knavish man,</l>
            <l>Or some poor Pudden fool's the best they can.—</l>
            <l>But stay, I've been to bold; methinks I see</l>
            <l>The <hi>English</hi> Monsieurs rise in mutiny,</l>
            <l>Crying confound him, does he damn <hi>French</hi> Plays,</l>
            <l>The only <hi>Pieces</hi> that deserve the Bayes:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>France</hi> that on fashions does strict Laws impose,</l>
            <l>The Universal Monarchy for Cloaths,</l>
            <l>That rules our most important part, our dress,</l>
            <l>Should rule our wit, which is a thing much less.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Messieurs</hi> he says, farther to provoke ye,</l>
            <l>He would as soon be Author of <hi>Tu Quoque,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>As any Farce that e're from <hi>France</hi> was sent,</l>
            <l>And all consider'd 'tis a complement,</l>
            <l>And yet he hopes the advantages they gain,</l>

               <speaker>Theo.</speaker>
               <p>There is an impossibility of getting my Fathers consent,

me your Person, and your Merit: I can never repay the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
I have received from you, that after seven years Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
you can be content to stay from your Countrey, your
Friends, and Kindred, and conceal your self from all the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57902:8"/>
world but me: But above all, to put your self for my sake,
in so base a condition, as to serve my Father, which is worse
than Rowing in Gallies, this Testimony of your Love can never
be forgotten.</p>

is the severest Task I have, to minister to his wretched Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
and endure the curses of all whom his extortion grieves.
Pardon me, dear <hi>Theodora,</hi> that I take this liberty before

               <p>You see Madam, Love is able to turne a man into all
Shapes, nay into the worst, a Flatterer, to a Covetous man:
But by the sordid applauding of what he does, and observing
all his Rules and Maximes, I have gained this point; That he
will hear or believe no man so soon as me.</p>

               <p>That's true Sir, but she may say, 'tis too rash to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve

               <p>Time, come I must take occasion by the fore-lock;
his Father (that is very rich, but of mean extraction) will
(for the sake of good Allyance) let his Son marry her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Portion.</p>

               <p>Without doubt Sir, no man can contradict that, but
your Daughter may answer you, that Marriage is the most
solemn thing in the world, and that which must make her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
either happy, or miserable.</p>

               <p>You have reason Sir, that decides all. But Sir, people
will tell you, that the inclination of your Daughter, ought to
be a little regarded; and that forcing affections has often
ruined the best of Families.</p>

               <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, there can be no reply to that: 'tis true, there are
a great many Fathers that prize the satisfaction of their
Daughters, and would never Sacrifice them to interest, but
would consult their affections.</p>

               <p>If it did not go extreamly well, you would not have

(if I had liv'd in that time) I would have been hang'd

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
               <p>Why Sir? I acquainted the Mother with your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and brought <hi>Isabella</hi> to the window (as you appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,)
where she survey'd your person, your age, your youth, I

               <speaker>Cheat.</speaker>
               <p>She likes your person infinitely, and her Mother,

               <p>'Tis her goodness, but in troth that was a little too

               <p>Oh shee'l be a vast Fortune, she will be worth above

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gold.</speaker>
               <p>And (if I can make so much more of her) I am sure
I'le make her consent, or I'le strangle her.

            <sp>

above Almonds, and Raysins, you need not keep a table fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished

none, this will be worth a thousand Pound a year; then she
hates all finery, Lace she detests out of hatred to the <hi>French.</hi>

thrift in Habits) will amount to above six thousand Pounds;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57902:17"/>
then she has a horrible aversion for Gaming, then Playes she

               <p>Then she abominates Singing-Masters, <hi>French</hi>-Masters,

               <p>Cods me I had like to have forgot that quality of

               <p>Love, when inclinations meet, is the only condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be enjoy'd. Love! there is no life without it; we do
but sleep, and dream we live, when we are not in love; and
pray Madam will you be pleased to wake out of this dream,
and think a little of one that loves you so, that his life or
death depends upon your breath.</p>

<stage>[Aside.]</stage>
                  <stage>[To Isabella]</stage> Madam, there is no honour but in love, the rest

Divinity.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theodore.</speaker>
               <p>I that have so little time, ought to make what

the malice that can be, seek to prevent me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Isabella.</speaker>
               <p>But Sir, I have a Mother (whom yet I never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey'd,)
that hath engag'd her self to your Father; and though
I confess, I can never think of marrying him, yet I must think
of no other, without her consent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theodore.</speaker>
               <p>This is you that made that engagement, I thank

               <speaker>Cheatly.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I did not know you had a passion here, but
I will make you amends: if I can marry her to <hi>Theodore</hi> 
                  <stage>[Aside]</stage>
he's liberal, and will reward me well; but his Father is the
most hidebound Fellow—he has the Villany of fifty <hi>Iews,</hi>
and, which is more, of ten <hi>London</hi> Brokers in him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theodore.</speaker>
               <p>Madam, let me have but some assurance, not to
to have your unkindness, and all other oppositions in the
world are trifles.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cheatly.</speaker>
               <p>Come Mrs. <hi>Isabella,</hi> hold off no longer; in short,
you told me you loved this Gentleman violently, and wish't
he were captivated with you; you did not wish it, that you
might use him ill; therefore, since 'tis your inclination, dissemble
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57902:33"/>
no longer: Here's the Gentleman, take him by the hand, he
is your own <hi>ipso facto,</hi> he's a proper Gentleman, make much
of him; here he is for you, and there's the short and the long
on't. Now Mr. <hi>Theodore</hi> I think I have made you amends.</p>

               <p>Sir, since she has betray'd my weakness, which she
for her Sex sake ought to have concealed, and I ought in
modesty not to have told you, pardon my easiness, and think
me not guilty of levity, if you do, you will be very unjust
to censure one that esteemes you so well.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theodore.</speaker>

               <p>I freely give you leave to do and say what ever

who I will perswade him is worth 500. l. more
than this Lady; and though Madam he loves you very much,
yet he loves a little money much more: This friend of mine
is but a Taylors Daughter, but I will make her Act a Countess
with some odd Title; and she can behave her selfe as proudly
and statelily, as the best of 'em, I will make him believe that
she has a very great mind to marry him for his care and thrift,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> This may make him release my Lady of her engagement.</p>

discovered a Countess that is not above thirty, that is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in love with you for your person, besides your care and

thrift, which she says to me, would be very useful to her in

               <p>Nay Sir, if you distrust me, there's no hurt done;
I did not think you would embrace the offer; but I thought
my self bound to discharge my trust, for the truth is, she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
me (though something unwilling) to use my care in
this business.</p>

               <p>Good faith, but if this be true, she is not more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable,
fifty Pounds is a noble Sum, and more than any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans

honest man, I meant no more hurt in't Sir, than I do at this

vow she's a pure Bed-fellow that's the truth on't) but at first
I was frighted, and wondr'd what a dickens was the matter,
when these Gentlemen came up with a Cawdle to me, and

            <l>When <hi>Affrica</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> are not spar'd,</l>
            <l>By some who in Rime will all the World o'rerun,</l>
            <l>Who in their Conquests will no Country shun,</l>
            <l>Not scaping the <hi>Mogul,</hi> nor <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>No <hi>American</hi> Prince is in his Throne secure,</l>
            <l>Not <hi>Totty Potty Moy</hi> himself is sure:</l>
            <l>But may the fury of their Rime endure,</l>
            <l>Nay in time each Prince in <hi>Guinny</hi> will be sought,</l>
            <l>And under these Poetick Fetters brought;</l>
            <l>And we shall see how th' black Rogues lov'd and fought.</l>
            <l>When such great things are for the Stage design'd,</l>
            <l>We fear this trifle will no favour find.</l>
            <l>But as a fop that's dress'd in Masquerade,</l>
            <l>Will any place with impudence invade,</l>
            <l>And little rambling Punks dare be so rude,</l>
            <l>Among the best of Ladies ro intrude:</l>
            <l>So Poets sure, though ill, may be allow'd</l>
            <l>Among the best in Masquerade to crowd.</l>
            <l>Our Poet who wrote this <hi>Incognito,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Does boldly claim this priviledge as his due;</l>
            <l>He presses in, and will not be kept out,</l>
            <l>Though he deserves to stand amongst the rout,</l>
            <l>Those fifteen hundred Poets who have writ,</l>
            <l>And never could have one Play acted yet.</l>
            <l>But now hee's in, pray use him civilly,</l>
            <l>Let him, what e're<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he sayes, unquestion'd be,</l>
            <l>According to the Laws of Masquerade,</l>
            <l>Those sacred Laws by dancing Nations made,</l>
            <l>Which the young Gallants sure will ne're invade.</l>
            <l>If ye resolve that yee'l be angry now,</l>
            <l>Ye vent your spleen upon an unknown Foe;</l>
            <l>Or if he be not, yet yee'l make him so:</l>
            <l>But if a kindness to him ye intend,</l>
            <l>And though 't deserves it not, the Play commend:</l>
            <l>Each man for ought he knows is kind to's friend.</l>
