            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſo that I ſhall neither wrong you nor it, in the handling thereof.

the originall (according to the learned tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) is <hi>verbatim,</hi> he ſharpened, or put an edge to Braſſe and Iron, metaphorically ſpeaking, that as a man finding a blunt knife or toole, doth ſet an edge therevpon; ſo did <hi>Tubalkain,</hi> finding this work, he laboured to bring it to a better perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then it was before. That it was before, it is very probable, if not out of queſtion, as <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Iunius</hi> heereupon with others obſerue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Kain</hi> tilled the ground before, which hee could not doe without Iron inſtruments, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ground being accurſed: ſo that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it is, he brought this trade to a greater perfection, and laboured more in it then before was laboured therein: From which we will haſten to the ſeueral doctrines from the ſame deducted. And firſt we will obſerue ſomewhat more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, conſidering him a wicked man, yea the ſonne of <hi>Lamech,</hi> by whome <hi>Poligamy</hi> or <hi>Bigamy</hi> firſt came in, one of <hi>Cains</hi> brood, ſeperated and remoued with the reſt (as in place, ſo in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) from the feare of God, yet had he riches and a trade, yea he excelled al others in his trade, bringing it to a greater perfection then before it was. That a wicked man ſhould be thus graced and outwardly furniſhed, we obſerue this doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, that the wicked may equallize,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> yea out goe the godly and deare ſeruants of God in theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, in hauing wiues, children, riches, skill in trades, and the like; which in generall the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19693:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Preacher experimentally confirmeth: ſaying in his ninth chapter, the 1. &amp; 2. verſes, <hi>I haue ſurely giuen my heart to all this, and to declare all this that the iuſt and the wiſe, and their workes are in the hands of God: and no man knoweth either loue or hatred of all that is before him. All things come alike to all: and the ſame condition is to the iuſt and to the wicked: to the good and to the pure, and to the polluted: and to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not: as is the good ſo is the ſinner: he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</hi> If this doe not ſufficiently bring light to the point, it may be cleared further by conſidering in particular inſtances, how the wicked haue matched, yea exceeded the godly in theſe things. For wiues and children; did not <hi>Ham</hi> equalize <hi>Iapheth</hi> and <hi>Schem?</hi> Gen. 10.6.21. was <hi>Iſhmael</hi> behinde <hi>Iſaak?</hi> Gen. 25.12.16 and had not <hi>Eſau</hi> wife and children as well as <hi>Iacob?</hi> In riches; did not <hi>Diues</hi> exceed <hi>Lazarus?</hi> But to haſten the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther execution and clearing of this poynt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I will adde theſe further proofes, for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable conuincing of this truth, Iob. 21. ver. 7. where <hi>Iob</hi> ſhewing this very thing, ſpeaketh thus: <hi>Wherefore doe the wicked liue and waxe olde, and growe in wealth? their ſeed is stabliſhed in their ſight with them, and their generation before their eyes, their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are peaceable without feare, and the rod of God is not vpon them: their Bullocke gendreth and faileth not: their Cow calueth and caſteth not her Calfe: they ſend forth their Children like Sheep, and their Sonnes dance,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19693:5"/>
they take the Tabret and Harpe and reioyce in the ſound of the Organs; they ſpend their dayes in wealth, and ſuddenly they goe downe to the graue.</hi> And who be theſe? euen ſuch as ſay to God <hi>Depart from vs for we deſire not the knowledge of thy waies.

Thirdly, they haue more time and meanes then Gods children to compaſſe theſe things, and to excell the godly therein, for firſt they ſpend much time in plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, carping and caring, &amp; ſtriuing to be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and great in theſe outward matters, which

            <p>Let vs deſcend to a ſecond, out of the wordes, namely, from the deſcription of him from his mother, who is named by her name, as alſo ſet forth by the fruite of her wombe, which is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall outward bleſſing &amp; end of marriage.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> how falſe the ground of men, (common in the world, whereby they meaſure their iudgement) is, viz. yee ſee God bleſſe it, and therefore it is good. Alas poore foole, doeſt thou meaſure Gods bleſſings by the outward ſucceſſe? nothing leſſe ſhould you conclude; and yet this is the rule of the world, as in caſe of marriage, partyes mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying not in the Lord and without parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, yea contrarie thereto, If they liue peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (as there is a peace amongſt the deuills) and haue children &amp; proſper in this world together, preſently ſay the men of the world, was it not pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but that they ſhould haue beene nought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? do not you ſee how God bleſſeth them with children, a peaceable life, &amp; worldly goods? alas, ſo he doth moſt wicked and wretched catifes, as <hi>Haman</hi> and his wiſe: but let ſuch know they haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

            </p>
            <p>For that wee ſee hereby how frequent a thing it is for the holy Ghoſt to obſerue the mother.

            <p>Oh let it be thy care, eſpecially who art a mother, to haue a ſpecial eie to thy ſelfe how thou walkeſt, talkeſt, workeſt, apparreleſt thy ſelfe before thy

Remember the Lord obſerueth you: he had need to look to his cariage &amp; behauiour when the Lord ſo eyeth &amp; obſerueth.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>2</label> their wiues with whome they match, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them wel before they make that match with them: <hi>quod ſemel ſtatuend. diu deliberand.</hi> Conſider their equality for religion, condicion, diſpoſition euery way, if thou reſpect thy ſelfe &amp; thy poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which thou mayſt looke and pray for, vpon the vſing of that ordinance: Whoſoeuer would haue good children, let him looke that he take a good wife, that may promiſe him much comfort that way.

where he planteth a Crabtree ſtock: no more can a man looke for good children where he marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a wicked wife. I knowe God may for the husbands ſake ſanctifie the children, (he being gracious) but it is not vſuall, for oftentimes God puniſheth the raſh and vnwarrantable matches of many of his owne children, with monſtrous children; Of ſuch matches came Gyants and monſtrous perſons in former times: of the like, came monſter, yea, ſonnes and daughters of <hi>Anak:</hi> If not in quantitie, yet in quality and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in our daies, as daily experience telleth vs: yea, often times ſuch matches are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with children, miſhapen in bodies and <label type="milestone">

Thirdly, this ſhould learne husbands to obſerue their wiues, &amp; not to endure prophane, vnchaſt, immodeſt behauiour in them: as immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt behauiour in word, in lookes, in apparrell, neither nicenes in meate, drinke, or the like, leaſt their children learne thereby, and their examples doe more hurt then thy inſtructions can doe them good: for often times it falleth out, that an euill example doth more hurt in one day, then godly exhortations can doe good in a whole weeke. Let husbands then looke to their wiues, <hi>dwelling with them, as men of knowledge, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing honour to them as to the weaker veſſels,</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and commending them in what is good; diſproouing and diſliking what is euill: and by al good meanes labouring the redreſſe thereof,

that it bee not at the length too truly ſaid, like mother, like daughter, which meeteth with the remiſſiuenes &amp; folly of many husbands: who for feare of diſpleaſing their wiues, fearing them more then God, yea making their wiues Idoles; whereas husbands ſhould pleaſe their wiues in that which is good and to edification, let euill humors ſo dwell in the head that the whole body at the length is tainted therewith.

            <p>Wee will now come to the next diſcription of him, &amp; that is from his calling: wherin we obſerue theſe foure things.

            <p>Oh let ſuch fall now to a calling! it is no ſhame to beginne to doe well, but it is a ſhame to liue out of a calling: And that I may perſwade them to it, and others who ſtand in any calling, chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to go on in it; I will lay downe ſome motiues to perſwade euery man to a perſonal calling.<note place="margin">Motiues to perticuler callings.</note> Firſt Idlenes is the mother of all euill, and an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the deuill to drawe men to euill by, yea,

And to theſe let me add all vnprofitable callings, for which the common wealth is worſe, not better, (being as the wennes or warts vpon

Thus much of this poynt: Wee will come to the ſecond thing in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19693:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this calling obſerued by vs; Namely, that as he had a calling, ſo he wrought in it; where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue we this poynt of doctrine,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> That euery man and woman muſt worke in that calling and trade, the Lord hath called them vnto: the former places proue this. <hi>Habel</hi> wrought in his calling; and this is much commended vnto vs, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the good wife. <hi>Shee lyeth not on the one ſide, but ſhe ſeeketh Wooll and Flax, and ſhe laboureth chearefully with her hands, ſhee girdeth her loynes with ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth &amp; ſtrengthneth her armes, ſhe putteth her hands to the wheele, &amp; her ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds handle the ſpindle &amp;c.

That which is here ſpoken of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the weaker (and teacheth that ſexe what to doe, is not to be idle but to worke in calling &amp; place the Lord hath allotted them vnto) is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken much more to commend &amp; teach men to do it, being the ſtronger. The reaſon of this poynt is cleare, becauſe God hath ordained callings,<note place="margin">Reaſ.</note> to keepe men from idlenes, not to draw them to it or to continue them in it. But before I come to ſhewe what vſes this doctrine learneth vs, let

man in his ſpeciall calling, to labour thus as much as a man can: the miniſter to labour by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, prayer, meditation, and conference: to be more and more furniſhed with the guiftes of the miniſtery, that he may be the better able to lay downe the truth with foundnes of argument, &amp; in the euidence of truth to reproue, conuince, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and inſtruct: and ſo euery mechanical tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in his trade: but becauſe a man may fall into many euills in labouring this, I will therefore for our direction lay downe and commend vnto vs a fewe rules to be obſerued of vs in labouring for more &amp; more skill in our callings and profeſſions.<note place="margin">Rules to the obſerued in attaining skill in our calling.</note> The firſt whereof is this, we muſt take heed that our deſire and endeuours to be skillfull and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in theſe things, doe not eat vp, or ſurmount our deſire, and endeuour to be perfect in better things, as moſt commonly it doth; the deuill and deſire of account and fame in the world, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching vs and ouer-ruling vs, that we little care or ſtudie for perfection in that great profeſſion, which is that one thing onely neceſſary; any thing will ſerue our turne that way, if wee come ceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly &amp; formally to pray, it is good enough.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>3</label> ſo come to the next and laſt doctrine. The laſt thing that this point learneth vs is, that if it be our duty to labour perfection in our callings &amp; trades, which are momentary, and that which wicked men may attayne vnto; much more ſhould we and all that profeſſe the feare of God, ſtriue to be perfect in our Chriſtian profeſſion: the benefit wherof wilbe euer abiding, and be more at the laſt then at the firſt, vnto which further then in a ſhew hereof, the wicked cannot attaine. Oh let vs not forget to labour perfection herein, ſtriuing to be perfect as our heauenly father is perfect; if skil in anything be worth the hauing, then in this; and let vs endeuour thereto dayly, that wee may be able to find out and meet with the ſubtilties and ſleights of our ſpirituall aduerſaryes, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, the world and the fleſh and the deceipts, our owne harts, which are deceiptful aboue meaſure, and who can finde them out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Alas it is nothing to be skilfull in other matters, and without skill and expertneſſe in this mayne matter, which is the one thing oneli neceſſary. And thus much for this point.

Secondly, this ſhould learne you againe, that be of this trade, to obſerue the Antiquity and obſeruablenes of it, and to walke worthy of it, that ye may gayne credit to it amongſt men, which fewe of you doe (though ſome doe bleſſed be God, yet moſt of you doe abuſe it, and diſhonour God in it and by it, and thereby bring reproch vpon your ſelues, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit your callings; a fearfull &amp; common ſinne: you being herein like to the ſonnes of nobles (I doe not ſay you are the ſonnes of nobles) the more antient their howſe is &amp; the more repute it hath had amongſt men, the more proud and inſolent they growe, diſpiſing other, and not onely ſo, but alſo they more diſſolute &amp; diſorderly they growe abuſing what they haue, the fearfull ſinne, of ſuch in our dayes; but ſo it ſhould not be, neither with you nor them, the more antient and obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your trade is, the greater note it hath with God, the more obſeruantly walke you with God; for where God giueth much he looketh for much againe: would not you iudge him worthy of the Kings deepe diſpleaſure that ſhould abuſe his fauour in ſetting him in a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19693:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
place of note, and by the ſame place encourage himſelfe to diſhonour the King? yes verily. How much more then are ye worthy to be thruſt out of Gods fauour, that abuſe his calling, ſo obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthy, wherevnto the Lord hath called you? For if not a haire of our head fall to the ground without Gods prouidence, certainly his prouidence is much more ſeene in guiding men to their places; but it is their ſinne (not this goodnes in bringing them to it) if they abuſe it. Thirdly, if this calling and trade be ſo obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>3</label> with God, it ſhould teach vs to obſerue it the more, and haue it in greater eſteeme; notably meeting with the baſe eſteeme of it, and of the workers in it in theſe daies, which ariſeth partly from our ſelues, &amp; partly from you that be of this trade: from vs, becauſe we conſider not the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of it, which if it were conſidered, it would worke a greater regard of it, and the perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing it, eſpecially ſuch of them as bee godly. That it is of neceſſity who can deny?<note place="margin">Cauſes why this Trade is ſo baſely eſteemed from others.</note> can the Husbandman till, ſowe, and reape without the helpe of it? can the Marriner trauaile the Seas without it? can the Carpenter build without it? can the Soldier fight without it? can any manlye in his houſe, ſleepe ſafely in his bed, and haue his goods in houſe, ſhop, and ware-houſe ſafe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this trade? I know he cannot, who then can ſay he hath no need of a Blacke-ſmiths helpe? If this were conſidered, ſurely we ſhould eſteeme it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19693:22"/>
more then we doe. The ſecond cauſe in ourſelues why we ſo little eſteeme it, is becauſe we are like children and fooles, carried away with ſhewes of things, not conſidering the truth and ſubſtance of them: we ſee the trade not ſo ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant as other trades bee, nor the perſons ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and faſhionable as others for the moſt part: and hence it is wee come ſo little to reſpecte the Trade. Alas here is our ſinne and folly, that we iudge of things according to the outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, wee conſider not this as the ordinance of God, and how profitable it is to the common wealth: wel let vs iudge more wiſely of theſe things, and not be carried awaye with ſhewes. Hence it conmeth that diuers Trades neither war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable nor profitable bee ſo much admitted, as toye-makers, and makers of newe faſhiond follies and the like; this is the bane, and will prooue the great impoueriſhment of the kingdome at the length; that needleſſe, yea graceleſſe trades be ſett vp, and this, and ſuch as this be, be ſo much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected? well the worth of theſe will appeare more <hi>carendo quam fruendo,</hi> but the inutilitie of theſe worthleſſe trades <hi>magis fruendo quam caren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> Theſe are too principall cauſes, why wee ſo little obſerue and regard this trade, ſo obſerued of God as wee ſee. Let vs amend the things that are in our ſelues, &amp; taking away the clouds that haue ſo dazeled our eyes, that we haue not ſeene nor rightly iudged, of the worth of this trade: &amp; let vs
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19693:22"/>
eſteeme it of more worth and regard for the time to come. And from theſe cauſes in our ſelues,<note place="margin">Cauſes in Black-ſmiths.</note> let vs diſcend to the cauſes in your ſelues, why it and yee come to be ſo baſely reputed and eſteemed as your are: The cauſes in your ſelues be diuers. Firſt in perticuler and inferior parties, ſome of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> you giuen to intollerable drunkennes, other to haſtines, vncivill and Churliſh behauiour at home and abroade. I knowe ye be fierie fellowes many of you by nature, and your fiery workes further it, therefore you ſhould ſtriue and ſet grace in the higheſt roome: it deſerueth it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the cauſe is in you that be Gouernours. Firſt, in your owne perſons, falling many times into theſe ſinnes, how can the body be ſound when the head is thus ſicke? I would I did not ſpeak truly both concerning the Gouernors of this and other companies for the moſt part. Secondly in that you doe not rule as you ſhould, ſeeing theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, eſpecially drunkennes and the like, publick &amp; notorious ſinnes (ſo diſgracefull to your trade and profeſſion) puniſhed; and this is the fault both of you that bee gouernors ouer the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and of you that be gouernours in another ſence ouer ſome fewe, namely of thoſe that be committed to you in ſeruice, and be vnder your roofes, you ſhould not permit any of theſe ſinnes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to harbour in them. Thirdly the cauſe is amongſt you all, and that in chooſing oft tymes, vnfit men to theſe places of gouernment, men more fit to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19693:23"/>
bee gouerned then to gouerne, being men either of ſcandalous life, as drunkards and the like: <hi>Wennes</hi> I ſay and wartes to the body of a common wealth, better ſpared then preſerued. Can there or did there euer come any good to a company by the gouerment of ſuch men? I trow not. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (beloued) if you would haue that eſteme and doe deſire your trade ſhould be of that credit it is meet you ſhould haue it be of, then eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one in perticuler, that is guilty of the foreſaid ſinnes, of drunkennes, of haſtye anger, of vnciuill &amp; Churliſh behauiour; Let him labour for grace, whereby he may become temporate, ſlowe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and of a meeke and quiet ſpirite, which are things both with God and men much ſet by. And for you that are Gouernors ouer the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, either preſent or are newely to be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, walke as men blameleſſe in your owne car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and for your owne examples, and vſe your authoritie for the reforming of theſe ſinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many of you, be not led by fauour to ſome nor fewe. The faces of others, doe what your places require you, and the Lord is with you. For you that are Gouernors in families, looke to thoſe that are in your tharge; which if euery one would make conſcience to doe (as he ſtandeth charged before God to doe) then ſuch enormous vices would be redreſſed amongſt you. To conclude with application to you all in the electing and eſtabliſhing of your Gouernors, as the Maſtier
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19693:23"/>
and Wardens, let your eyes, hearts and hands goe with ſuch that be of lawfull Trades, of blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les liues, and that can rule &amp; gouerne their owne Howſes well; for how canne you looke for a good gouernment from thoſe that knowe not how to gouerne themſelues, nor their owne familyes: oh chooſe men fearing God, &amp; hating couetouſnes, and ſuch as will be men of courage for good and againſt ſinne. Thus haue I ſhewed you the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and the obſeruablenes of your trade, as it is in truth. As alſo how both you and it come to be ſo diſgracefull amongeſt men. It behoueth you to remoue the cauſes, and ſo the effect will be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: ſo ſhall your trade be of more eſteeme in the world, and you of more reſpect with God and man. Which God (for his mercies ſake in Chriſt Ieſus who is bleſſed for euer) graunt. Amen. Amen.</p>
