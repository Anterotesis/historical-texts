            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>As God brought upon that people for their ſins, a fearful deſtruction; So hee hath in his juſt wrath ſent his deſtroying Angel againſt us, for ours; the ſins that brought the Plague upon them were, <hi>Whoredome</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi>: I cannot ſay the ſame ſins have cauſed ours; for although the execution of good Laws, againſt both <hi>Incontinent</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous</hi> perſons hath been of late years, and yet is (wee all know) to ſay no more, ſlack enough, yet (Gods Holy Name be bleſſed for it) neither <hi>Idolatry</hi> nor <hi>Whoredome</hi> are at that heighth of ſhameleſs impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and impunity among us, that they dare out-brave our <hi>Moſeſes,</hi> and out-face whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, as it was in <hi>Iſrael</hi>; But ſtill, this is ſure, no Plague but for ſin: nor National Plagues, but for National ſins; So that albeit, none of us may dare to take upon us, to bee ſo farre of <hi>Gods Counſel,</hi> as to ſay for what very ſins moſt this Plague is ſent among us: yet none of us can bee ignorant, but that beſides thoſe ſecret, perſonal Corruptions which are in every one of us, and whereunto every ones heart
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42873:5"/>
is privy, there are many Publick and National ſins, whereof the people of this Land are generally guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and is abundantly ſufficient to juſtifie God in his dealings towards us, <hi>when he judgeth us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our wretched unthankfulneſs unto God, for the long continuance of his Goſpel, and our Peace, our carnal confidence, and ſecurity in the ſtrength of our wooden and watry walls: our riot and exceſſe, (the noted and proper ſins of this Nation) and much intemperate abuſe of the good Creatures of God, in our meats, drinks, and diſports, and other proviſions and comforts of this life. Our incompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards our Brethren miſerably waſted with war and famine in other parts of the World, our heavy oppreſſion of our Brethren at home, in racking the Rents, cracking the backs, and grinding the face of the poor: Our cheap and irreverent regard to Gods Holy Ordinances, of his Word, Sacraments, Sabbaths and Miniſters, our wantonneſſe and toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs of underſtanding, in corrupting the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of our Chriſtian Faith, and troubling the peace of the Church, with a thouſand niceties, novelties and unneceſſary wranglings in matters of Religion: and to reckon no more, that univerſal corruption in Courts of Juſtice by ſale of Offices, enhauncing Fees, deviſing new ſubtilties, for delay and evaſion, truck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for expedition; making traps of petty paenal ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and but Cobwebs of the moſt weighty and material Laws.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not, but through the mercy of God, many of his ſervants in this Land, are free from ſome, and ſome from all theſe common crimes in ſome good meaſure: But I fear me, not the beſt of us all, not a man of us all, but are guilty of all or ſome of them, at
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42873:6"/>
leaſt thus far, that we have not mourned for the Corruptions of the times ſo feelingly, nor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the reformation of them ſo faithfully, as we might, or ought to have done.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Gouge</hi>'s words, in his plaiſter for the Plague are theſe:</p>
               <q>That it may appear what juſt cauſe the Lord hath to poure out the Vials of his wrath among us, it will be a ſeaſonable taske to take a view of our own times, and to obſerve, whether the fore-named ſins may be found among us, for too truly it may now be ſaid of this Land, of this City there is wrath gone out from the Lord, the Plague is begun; in proſecuting this taske, I will follow the order before propounded; and bring thoſe ſins which have been proved formerly, to have provoked Gods wrath, to our times; 1. For Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, though the bright light of the Goſpel hath for many years diſpelled the thick cloud of Popery, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Idolatry, yet in many places that cloud ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth and thickeneth again; I pray God it encreaſe not as that cloud which <hi>Eliah</hi>'s ſervant eſpyed, which though at firſt it were but a little one, like a mans hand, yet it grew to cover the whole Sky, and to cauſe much Rain; too many ſeducers are among us; too great countenance is given to them, wee Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have need to inculcate this Apoſtolical prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, flee from Idolatry.
<p n="2">2 For prophanation of Holy things and times, he is blinde that diſcerneth it not; he himſelf is too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, that is not in his Righteous ſoul vexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. Prayer, Preaching, Sacraments, are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglected, or very careleſſely obſerved, as for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42873:6"/>
the Lords day, it is in many places by many perſons made the Devils day; it is not onely in act prophaned, but the prophanation therof too much countenanced, and juſtified.</p>

The Angel of God follows you, and you doubt, whether you ſhall fly, if a Lyon out of the Forreſt ſhould purſue you, you would make no queſtion, yet could hee do it unſent; what is the difference? Both inſtruments of Divine Revenge; both threaten death, one by ſpilling the blood, the other by Infecting it; who knows whether hee hath not appointed your Zoan out of the liſts of this deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, you ſay it is Gods viſitation; What evil is not? If war have waſted the confines of your Countrey, you ſave your throats by flight, why are you more favourable to Gods immediate Sword of Peſtilence; every Leproſie by Gods Law, requires a ſeparation, yet no mortal ſickneſs, when you ſee a noted Leper proclaim his uncleanneſs in the ſtreet; will you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him for his ſake that hath ſtricken him, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void him for his ſake, that hath forbidden you? If you honour his Rod, much more will you regard his Precept; if you miſlike not the affliction, becauſe hee ſends it, then love the life, which you have of his ſending; Fear the Judgement which he will ſend, if you love it not, hee that bids us fly when wee are perſecuted, hath neither excepted Angel nor Man; Whether ſoever I fear, our guiltineſſe, if wilfully wee fly not; But whither ſhall wee fly from God, ſay you? where ſhall hee not both finde and lead us? whither ſhall not our deſtiny follow us? Vain men,

wee may run from our home, not from our graves; Death is ſubtil, our time is ſet; wee cannot, God will not alter it; alaſs, how wiſe wee are to wrong our ſelves? becauſe death will over take us, ſhall we run and meet him, becauſe Gods decree is ſure, ſhall wee bee deſperate, ſhall wee preſume, becauſe God changeth not; Why do not we try every knife and cord, ſince our time is neither capable of prevention, nor delay: our end is ſet, not without our means, in matter of danger, where the end is not known, the means muſt bee ſuſpected, in matter of hope, where the end is not known, means muſt bee uſed: Uſe then freely the means of your flight, ſuſpect the danger of your ſtay; and ſince there is no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar neceſſity of your preſence, know, that God bids you depart and live: You urge the inſtance of your Miniſter, how unequally, there is not more lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in your flight, then ſin in ours; you are your own wee our peoples, you are charged with a body which you may not willingly loſe, nor hazard by ſtaying; wee with all their ſouls, which to hazard by abſence is to loſe our own; wee muſt love our lives; but not when they are Rivals with our ſouls, or with others. How much better is it to bee dead, then negligent, then faithleſſe: If ſome bodies be contagiouſly ſick, ſhall all ſouls bee wilfully neglected? there can bee no time wherein good counſel can bee ſo ſeaſonable, ſo needful, every threatning finds impreſſion, where the minde is prepared by ſenſible Judgements.</p>

               <p>A Good calling is that way wherein God by his Divine Providence ſetteth a man, and wherein hee hath appointed him to walk, in that way he hath given his Angels charge over him to keep him; where we have the Angels to Miniſter for us, and to encamp round about us; what need wee to fear? they will either keep us ſafe from danger in this world, or if it ſeem good to God, to take us out of this world, they will carry our ſouls into Heaven, as they did the ſoul of <hi>Lazarus.</hi>

or no, as for extraordinary Callings, they muſt bee warranted by an extraordinary ſpirit, which is rare, if at all in theſe daies, but ordinary Callings, have their expreſs warrant in Gods Word.

               <p>Of old, Chriſtians were ſo charitable in relieving ſuch as were viſited with the plague, as willingly they hazarded their own lives; for proof whereof, I will here ſet down, what <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> reporteth, in an Epiſtle to the Brethren in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>

               <p>In this ſort, the beſt of our Brethren departed this life, whereof ſome were Miniſters, ſome Deacons, in great reverence among the common people; So that this kinde of Death for their great piety and ſtrength of Faith, may ſeem to differ nothing from Martyrdome, for they took the dead bodies of the Saints, whoſe breaſts, and faces, and hands, lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,

               <p>THey that would avoid the Judgements that fall on the Wicked, muſt avoid communion with them; For this end, did God cauſe an Ark to bee made for <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family to go into, from the old World, that ſo they might bee preſerved from the general Deluge, and ſent his Angels, to bring <hi>Lot,</hi> and ſuch as belonged to him, out of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>; to this purpoſe, the People of God were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to remove out of the midſt of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to deliver every man his ſoul, which adviſe is alſo given, in regard of Spiritual <hi>Babylon</hi> to come out of her, and that on this ground, that they receive not her Plagues; Saints by ſeparating themſelves from the Wicked in time of Judgement, ſhew their care to uſe what means they can for preventing miſchief, which is a point of wiſdome, commended by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Ghoſt, who giveth this note of a Wiſe man, <hi>A prudent man foreſeeth the evil, and hideth himſelf; but the ſimple paſs on, and are puniſhed.</hi> This care of uſing means for ſafety, and in the uſe of means, to depend on God for his bleſſing, is well pleaſing to God. God had promiſed that none in the Ship with <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be loſt; yet when ſome of the ſhip-men were about to leave the Ship. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Except theſe men abide in the ſhip, ye cannot be ſaved.</hi> All lawful and warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means are the viſible hand of God's inviſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: to reject or neglect means, is to refuſe to take God by the hand when he reacheth it out unto us, and to follow his viſible direction.</p>
               <p>It is therefore fooliſh preſumption, rather than a prudent reſolution, either to accompany thoſe that are as it were in the fire of God's judgement, or not to go from them when a fair and warrantable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is offered. This is taxed as a point of folly in <hi>Lot</hi>'s ſons in Law. <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> too much failed herein; he heard the Prophet ſay that <hi>Ahab</hi> ſhould fall at <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> and yet he would accompany him thither; it had almoſt coſt him his life: yet hath God his wayes and means to deliver the righteous, in the forementioned caſes, and all other caſes whatſoever.

It is ſaid of Chriſt, that <hi>he will thorowly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into his garner, but will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</hi> Men when they fan their corn cannot do it ſo thorowly clean, but that ſome chaffe or tares will remain with the wheat, and ſome wheat be caſt out with the chaffe: witneſs the offal that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains after the beſt fanning that men can make: but God's fanning is a thorow fanning; not a grain, not a Saint ſhall be over-ſlipt. This is indeed moſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant of the laſt fanning of the world at the day of Judgement: yet in the mean time doth the Lord take notice of every one of his, to provide for them, and in the moſt common and general judgements doth that which in his wiſdome he ſeeth to be fit for them. When <hi>Elijah</hi> thought he had been left alone in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God knew many more, yea he could tell the juſt number of them: Thou mayeſt therefore, O faithful one, ſay of the Lord, <hi>He is my refuge and fortreſs, my God, in him will I truſt.

This kinde of Plague ariſeth from no diſtemper of blood, putrefaction of humours, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Stars, but falleth meerly from the ſtroke of God's puniſhing Angel (ſuch were the Plagues of old, as you may read in <hi>Exodus</hi> 12. &amp; <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.16, 25. alſo 2 <hi>Samuel</hi> 24. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.) whereof ſome die ſuddenly, without any precedent or foregoing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, or conceit of infection. Others again, though they be ſick before they die, yet their firſt taking hath been after an extraordinary manner. Some whereof I have talkt with, who have ingenuouſly confeſt, they at their firſt infection felt themſelves manifeſtly ſtricken, being ſenſible of a blow ſuddenly given them; ſome on the head and neck; others on the back and ſide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſometimes ſo violently, that they have been

as it were knockt down to the ground, remaining for a time ſenſleſs, whereof ſome have died inſtantly, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in a ſhort time after; and thoſe that did reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, eſcaped without humane help or means. For this kinde of Plague, as it is rare, ſo it is by all art of man incurable. Therefore no method but Repentance, no medicine but Prayer can avert or heal this ſtroke. Of all Antidotes for the body, that Triacle is the beſt eſteemed which is made of the fleſh of earthly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents: but for the ſoul, that only which is made of the blood of the brazen Serpent, which was lifted up on the Croſs for our ſins. He that by a lively faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth the benefit of our bleſſed Saviours ſufferings to the <hi>Plague-ſore</hi> of his ſoul, ſhall undoubtedly recover, (if not health here, yet) heaven hereafter. The putrid Plague is a popular Feaver, venemous and infectious, ſtriking chiefly (when firſt ſeizing the body) at the very heart, and for the moſt part is accompanied with ſome ſwelling, which is either called a Blain, a Botch or Carbuncle; or elſe with ſpots, called <hi>Gods Tokens.</hi> This comes of putrefaction of blood and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the body, which it pleaſeth God ſometimes to make the inſtrument of his puniſhing juſtice, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with the ſimple Plague before-mentioned.

               <p>The winds likewiſe are led into their motions by the Starry-courſe; the Planets (eſpecially the Sun) by extracting the earths exhalations (which are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the windes) do ſet them ſo on work: And the windes, ſome are naturally wholeſom, others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſom. The South-winde blowing from the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, is of nature hot and moiſt, and full of ſhowers. Now when by the influence of the Stars this winde bloweth long, and bringeth continual rain, it cauſeth much moiſture in all airy and earthly bodies; and ſo much the more, by how much the milder it is. This moiſture being in ſuch abundance, cannot be digeſted nor attenuated by the Suns beams or heat, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſetling together, it muſt needs putrifie; and that ſo much the ſooner, becauſe the heat of the Sun (not being able to extract all) doth inflame what remains; by which inflammation the putrifaction becomes the greater. In this manner are the windes in cauſe: and moreover, they do ſometimes transfer the contagion from one Region to another; as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> affirmeth the Plague to be brought over the Sea from <hi>Aethiopia</hi> into <hi>Greece</hi> by the South-winde. Now if the Stars be peſtilentially bent againſt us, neither Arts nor Arms, Perfumes nor Prayers, can prevail with them; who have neither pity, ſenſe, nor power to alter their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions appointed them by the Omnipotent Creator.

Other cauſes there are alſo of this putrid Plague; namely, corrupt and unwholeſom feeding, all ſorts of unſavory ſtenches, proceeding either from Carrion, Ditches, rotten Dunghils, Vaults, Sinks, naſty Kennels and Streets (ſtrewed with all manner of filth) ſeldom cleanſed. Wherefore I cannot but juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applaud the prudence of the right Honourable the preſent Lord Mayor, in taking ſo much care, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch ſtrict order, that the kennels and ſtreets be very frequently ſwept and kept ſweet, every one throwing fair water before his own door thrice a day, to cool as well as cleanſe: A good primary way for prevention of any enſuing general infection: he wiſely adviſed that ſaid, <hi>Principiis obſta,</hi> Hinder begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.

               <head>Who are moſt ſubject to infection.</head>
               <p>IN the way of preſervation, it is firſt neceſſary to be conſidered, Whether the Plague be infectious or not; and then, who are moſt or leaſt ſubject (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to natural reaſon) to receive this infection. This putrid Plague is (as I have ſaid in the definition) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous and infectious, beſt known by experience. By venom or poyſon, the Reader is to underſtand ſomething that hath in it a dangerous ſubtle quality, that is able to corrupt the ſubſtance of a living body, to the deſtruction or hazard of the life thereof. This working is apparent in this Sickneſs, by his ſecret and inſenſible inſinuation of himſelf into the <hi>vital Spirits</hi>; to which, as ſoon as he is gotten, he ſheweth himſelf a mortal enemy, offering with ſudden violence to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh them. His ſubtle entrance, ſlie cruelty, and ſwift deſtroying; the unfaithfulneſs of his <hi>Criſis,</hi> and the other Prognoſtick ſignes, with the vehemency, grievouſneſs and ill behaviour of his ſymptoms, do all declare by manifeſt proofs his venemous quality: For in this diſeaſe the Urine and ſweat have a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and abominable ſavour, the breath ſtinks and is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42873:33"/>
noiſom; ill colour'd ſpots, puſtles, bliſters, ſwellings, and ulcers full of filthy matter ariſe in the outward parts of the body; ſuch, as no ſuperfluity or ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of humours, nor any putrefaction of matter (without a venemous quality joyned with it) can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly produce. Now though this Diſeaſe may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the Learned to be venemous, yet ſome ignorant perſons may ſay it is not infectious. To ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie ſuch, I define Infection or Contagion to be that which infecteth another with his own quality by touching it; whether the <hi>Medium</hi> of the touch be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, ſpiritual, or an airy breath. Of this kinde there are divers Diſeaſes that are infectious, though not ſo deadly as the Plague: As the Itch and ſcabbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Warts, Meaſels, Small-pox, and that which is venereal too, called <hi>Morbus Gallicus</hi>; theſe by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and corporeal touches do infect: Alſo ſore eyes do by their ſpirituous beams infect others eyes; and the Ptiſick or putrified Lungs, do by their corrupt breath infect others that are ſound. But the Plague infects by all theſe wayes; and ſuch ſick bodies infect the outward Air, and that Air again infects other bodies: for there is a ſeminary tincture full of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous quality, that being very thin and ſpirituous, mixeth it ſelf with the Air; and piercing the Pores of the body, entreth with the ſame Air, and mixeth it ſelf with the humours &amp; ſpirits of the ſame body alſo: For proof of this, experience giveth us to underſtand, that Garments, Coffers, nay walls of Chambers will a long time retain any ſtrong ſcent wherewith they have been fumed. Now the ſcent is meerly a quality, and his ſubſtance is the Air, which is alſo the <hi>vehicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> wherein it is ſeated and conveyed. So doth the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42873:33"/>
Peſtilent infection take hold, though not ſenſibly (for the ſtrongeſt poyſons have little taſte or ſmell) yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, as experience teſtifieth; for garments and houſhold-ſtuff have been infected, and have infected others. As <hi>Fracaſtinus</hi> tells of a furr'd Gown, that was the death of twenty five men in <hi>Verona</hi> (when that City was viſited) who one after another wore it, thinking ſtill they had aired it ſufficiently. And if <hi>Alexander Benedictus</hi> may be believed, feather-beds will keep the Contagion ſeven years. Other experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences we have alſo of living Poultry, which being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſores, were taken away dead, though no ways cruſhed or hurt in the leaſt. But ſay ſome, Then why is not one infected as well as another? I have eaten in the ſame diſh, drank in the ſame cup, and have lain in the ſame beds with infected perſons, and then too, whilſt their ſores were running; yet never had the Plague in my life. By way of anſwer, there may be two ſpecial cauſes for this: The firſt and principal cauſe, is the protection of the Almighty, which preſerves ſome as miraculouſly, as his juſtice ſtrikes others dreadfully. Thus through his mercy he often preſerves thoſe that with faithful and conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble care do their duties like Chriſtians about the ſick, being warrantably called thereunto, and not thruſting themſelves either preſumptuouſly or raſhly into the buſineſs, without a juſt and reaſon-rendring cauſe: for God hath given his Angels charge over us, to keep us <hi>in all our ways,</hi> ſuch as may be eſteemed lawful. In the next place, every peſtilential Contagion is not of the ſame nature, nor hath equal conformity with every conſtitution, Age, or manner of live: for ſome Contagion is apt only to infect the ſanguine comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42873:34"/>
ſome the cholerick, ſome the phlegmatick only; ſome children, ſome youths, ſome thoſe of ripe age, ſome antient people; and where the ſeminary tincture hath no analogie, there will be none or very little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And firſt, thoſe are moſt apt to be infected that have thin bodies and large open Pores, and whoſe hearts are ſo hot, that they need much attraction of Air to cool them; alſo they whoſe veins and veſſels are full of groſs humours, the venemous matter being thick, and therefore unapt to breath through the Pores, their putrefaction is increaſed by the inward heat, and ſo driven to malignity, and thence on-ward to a peſtilent quality. Hence thoſe bodies that are moiſt and full of phlegmatick humours, whoſe veins are ſtraight (and therefore apter to intercept then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain thoſe well-concocted juices that would make the pureſt blood) and the thickneſs of whoſe skin denyeth the tranſpiration of excrements; theſe are eaſily polluted and infected. And ſuch are women, eſpecially women with child; for their bodies are full of excrementitious humours, and much heat withal, which is as oyl and flame put together. Alſo Virgins, that are ripe for marriage, are apt to receive infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and being ſtricken, ſeldom or never eſcape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great means: <hi>Quia ſpirituoſum ſemen in motu eum ſit facile ſuccenditur; vel quia intus detentum facile cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumpitur, &amp; in veneni perniciem abit.</hi> Their blood being hot, and their ſeed retain'd for want of copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the one will ſoon be inflam'd, the other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; from thence infection. Alſo young children, in regard of their ſoft, tender, and moiſt bodies; and likewiſe, becauſe as their meats are moiſter, ſo they feed with more appetite then judgement. Likewiſe,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42873:34"/>
the more pure and delicate complexions, whoſe blood is finer and thinner then others, is ſo much the more apt to receive mutation; and the Contagion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates it ſelf with more facility into all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; but firſt and moſt eaſily into blood, choler next, more ſlowly into phlegm, but very ſeldom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to melancholy. Thoſe that are very coſtive, and have not a frequent propenſity to make water; for the noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom vapours that are by theſe excrements engendred, make the body apt to infection. Thoſe that faſt too long (their bodies being empty) receive more Air in then they let out; and (their ſpirits being weakened for want of due nouriſhment) they have leſs ſtrength to reſiſt the Contagion. On the other ſide, gluttons and drunkards (let them argue what they will for the filling of the veins, as they uſe to ſay, to keep out the evil Air) can never be free from crudities and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered blood, which eaſily takes infection, as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> teſtifies; <hi>Corpora impura quo magis aluntur, eo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis laeduntur</hi>; impure bodies, the more they are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, the more they are endangered. Poor people, by reaſon of their great want, living ſluttiſhly, and feeding naſtily and unwholeſomly on any food they can with leaſt coſt purchaſe, have corrupted bodies; and of all others, are therefore moſt ſubject to this Sickneſs. At this preſent, moſt of thoſe houſes which are infected, are the habitations of poverty, in ſome obſcure cloſe place in the Suburbs; as towards St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> One houſe I know more eſpecially by <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitors-Alley,</hi> where the Man, his Wife and Childe liv'd in a Room that look'd more like, for bigneſs, a great Cheſt then any thing elſe: They had not ſpace enough (according to the vulgar ſaying) to ſwing a Cat in;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42873:35"/>
ſo hot by reaſon of the cloſeneſs, and ſo naſtily kept beſides, that it even took away a mans breath to put his head but within the doors. In this houſe, all this little family died lately, in two dayes. The childe dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuddenly, the neighbours were afraid to come near them. The man having languiſhed a long time, for want of Air, as well as money, and he not able to ſtir out, and none coming to his relief, dyed quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after. The woman being as big with child as ſhe could tumble, ſeeing her child dead on the one ſide, and her husband in his cloaths on the other, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by all, fell in labour and dyed too, inſtantly. A very true and ſad accident, which doubtleſs was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by their loathſom living, but perfected by the cruelty of thoſe that lived near them. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, nearneſs of blood and kindred, by ſympathy of nature, is another aptneſs. But old folks, whoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are cold and dry; confident ſpirits, whoſe very courage is an Antidote, if they keep their bodies clean by a regular courſe of life; and thoſe that have the Gout, in whom the nobler parts of the body do expel the noxious humours to the ignobler, have the ſame benefit of non-infection; as Milch-nurſes have, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their children ſuck the evil juices from them with their milk. Theſe are in the way likely to eſcape; but if the Nurſe be infected, the childe cannot reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it. Laſtly, they who keep themſelves private, or have Iſſues, Ulcers, Haemorrhoids, or women that have their courſes abundantly, are leaſt ſubject to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; becauſe the hurtful humours are by thoſe means drained away.</p>

               <p>Air we ſhall firſt begin with, ſince it is that we draw in with our breath continually, and we cannot live without it one minute; for it is the food of our ſpirits, and therefore we had need take heed that the Air we draw be pure and wholeſom. The whole ſtream of opinion runs upon a cold and dry air; ſo commending the North and Eaſt windes as moſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42873:36"/>
wholeſom, and condemning the hot and moiſt air en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred by the South and Weſt windes, as the fitteſt matter for infection, becauſe moſt apt to putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So <hi>Galen</hi> affirmeth, ſaying, That the hot and moiſt conſtitution of the Air doth moſt of all breed peſtilential diſeaſes. From his mouth many modern Authors have learned to ſpeak the ſame thing: yet we know, that the hot and dry weather alſo may cauſe a contagious air. <hi>Titus Livius</hi> mentioneth in his Decades, that <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo infected by an hot and dry diſtemper of the Air. It is not out of my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that the Summer 1624. preceding the great Sickneſs, was an extream dry and parching Summer: I pray God this Summer prove not a Mother to a like Contagion. Now to avoid the miſchiefs of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome air, take <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his counſel (in his Treatiſe of humane Nature) walk abroad as little as may be, and as much as may be ſhun paſſing by any place infected; but by no means would I adviſe any to flie, though the Sickneſs ſhould ſpread all over the City: For, in the laſt great Viſitation, many with <hi>Daedalus</hi> did put on wings, that with <hi>Icarus</hi> dropt down by the way. Only my counſel is this: Should the Sickneſs increaſe, let every one keep himſelf as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate as he may; ſhun throngs of people, and all wet, cloſe, and ſtinking places; walk not abroad before, not after Sun; keep moderation between heat and cold in all things: yet rather incline to heat a little, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of drying up ſuperfluous moiſtures. Let not your houſes be peſtered with many Lodgers; and it is beſt for thoſe that are able, to have change of Beds and Chambers to lie in, that the air in them may be kept free and ſweet. Keep every Room daily very clean, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42873:36"/>
let there be no ſluts corners; let not water ſtand ſo long in any veſſel as to putrifie, which in hot weather it will ſoon do. Make fires every day in every room, in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity according to the largeneſs of the room, and the temperature of the weather: perfume them in cold and moiſt weather with Frankincenſe, Storax, Benjamin, Pitch, Rozin, Lignum-Aloes, Lignum Rhodium, Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-wood, or the Berries; in hot and dry weather, with Roſe-water on a hot fire-ſhovel, or ſome ſuch like cool fume, in a perfuming-pot: ſtrew the windows and ledges with Rue, Worm-wood, Lavender, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joram, Peniroyal, Coſtmary, and ſuch like, in cold weather; but in hot, with Primroſes, Violets, Roſe-leafs, Borage, Bugloſs, and ſuch cooling ſcents. For garments, avoid as much as may be, all leather, wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and furr; alſo velvets, pluſh, and ſhag; but chuſe ſuch as may be watered, as chamlets, grograms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for their gummineſs excludeth infectious air beſt: ſhift your ſhirt often, and cloaths alſo; and before you put them on again, perfume them well: be ſure you take care that you buy not old cloaths, bedding, or ſuch like ſtuff; for the garments of infectious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons deceaſed, are uſually put to ſale, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prove very dangerous to the buyer. Carry in your mouth a piece of the Pill of Citron or Lemmon; a Clove is of excellent uſe to that purpoſe: forget not to carry in your hand a Lemmon ſtuck with Cloves, ſweet Marjoram, Lavender, Balm, Rue, or Worm-wood, and thereunto ſmell frequently: I ſhould commend for your uſe Camphire, becauſe it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an excellent cool fume for ill airs; but I would have thoſe that have cold and weak ſtomacks to beware thereof, ſince ſuch are very much weakned
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42873:37"/>
by the uſe of it. Though <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and <hi>Cardan</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Galbanum, burning of leather, and ſmelling to horſe-dung; yet my advice is to eſchew unſavoury ſmells and ſtinking odours; judging what are ſweet and pleaſant more proper, becauſe they dilate, reſtore, and comfort the ſpirits, whereas the contrary do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and by repugning them, weaken the faculties.</p>

            <div type="diet">
               <head>What manner of Diet is to be obſerved for ſelf-preſervation.</head>
               <p>THe next thing which we ſhall handle for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is the due obſervation of diet for meat and drink. Let your meat be always good and ſweet, temperate, betwixt hot and cold, and not too moiſt or flaſhy, eaſie of digeſtion, and ſuch as makes the beſt blood: if your purſe cannot purchaſe Turkey, Capon, Pullet, Partridge, Pheaſant, Pidgeons, Larks, Black-birds, Thruſhes, Finches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (all which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford as much wholeſom nouriſhment to the body, as pleaſure to the taſte) feed then on Beef, Mutton, Lamb, Kid, and Rabbits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of Fiſh, which ſhould be eaten but ſeldom, although of the beſt kinde, thoſe I approve, are freſh Salmon, Trout, Barbel, Shrimps, Plaice and Flounders, (when they are firm) Smelts, Mackerel, Gudgeon, Mullet, Soal, Gurnard both gray and red, Lobſter and Cray-fiſh: but Eeles and Lampreyes, and all ſuch as delight in mud, are to be avoided. Turkeys and Hens-eggs are very good. Oyl and Butter are kindes of Antidotes againſt venom. Let thoſe who have hot conſtitutions, drink ſometimes Butter-milk or Whay; but more eſpecially if it be clarified with cool hearbs: eat not fruits at any time,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42873:37"/>
ſparingly; and then too, thoſe which are, as Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Plumbs, and Goosberries, before they be full ripe; alſo Peaches, Quinces, Pomegranads, Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Lemmons, Medlars, Cervices, Mulberries, Raſps, Strawberries and Currans, which being not ripe, are aſtringent, but at full maturity do looſen the body. But of Wall-nuts, Filberts, and Small-nuts, the elder are the better: dryed fruits are alſo good, and ſo are Peaſe, Beans and Artichoaks, which may be uſed ſometimes by lean and ſpare bodies. The beſt roots, are Onyons, Leeks and Radiſhes, for in theſe is great power and vertue againſt venom, yet offenſive to hot heads and weak eyes. Of hearbs, Mints, Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, Sage, and Thime, and Rue, with thoſe hearbs afore-mentioned. For ſallets and ſauces, Burrage and Bugloſs, Violets, Fennel, and eſpecially Sorrel, Olives alſo and Capers. As a Plant, let me not forget to mention the inexpreſſible vertues of Tobacco, the fume whereof hath been approved the moſt ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Antidote againſt peſtilential Contagion: The truth hereof is in a great meaſure of late confirm'd by the practiſe of the moſt eminent, now taken for this very reaſon, by the advice of the beſt of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians now extant, though not long ſince ſlighted and prohibited: a pipe taken faſting in the morning is the beſt time. Theſe following likewiſe have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent property in them for this purpoſe: Vinegar, Verjuice, juice of Lemmons and Oranges, which for their dryneſs reſiſt putrefaction; and for their cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Feavers. Beware of Cabbages, Coleworts, Lettice, Pompions, Musk-mellons and Cucumbers; for they are very dangerous meats in contagious times: neither can I approve of any other roots then
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42873:38"/>
Garlick for ruſtick bodies; and for others, only Ony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Leeks and Radiſhes, as I ſaid before. Let your fleſh be roaſted, for that is the wholeſomeſt way of dreſſing it. Either fry or boyl your fiſh: as for drink, you muſt take but as little as may well be born, of the beſt and pureſt. Wine is the beſt liquor for weak ſtomacks and aged people: but let not youth meddle therewith, leſt it breed in them inflammations, after which follows putrefaction, which is a fit hoſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſuch an ill gueſt as the Peſtilence. Wheaten bread of a day old, and a little leaven'd, is abſolutely the beſt for healthy people: light biskets alſo with aniſe-ſeeds are very good. I cannot preſcribe the ſtrict quantity of eating and drinking, ſince I know not how to ſtint every mans ſtomack; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall let ſeaſon, place, and cuſtom bear ſome ſway in theſe things; only beware of cramming ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety, ſince meat and drink immoderately taken, cauſe ſickneſs; for from thence ariſe crudities, which breed new diſeaſes. Therefore let <hi>Avicen</hi> adviſe you in theſe words: <hi>Riſe alwayes from meat with ſome remaining appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; for within a little time, as ſoon as the meat firſt eaten beginneth to digeſt, hunger will then ceaſe.</hi> And hence it is, that ſome greedily following the ſence of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite only, over-charge their ſtomacks, even to vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before they feel themſelves ſatisfied; becauſe though the veſſel be over-full, yet appetite is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd, till concoction hath begun her work upon that which is already received. Others may be taxed for the like immoderate drinking, ſo exceſſive therein, that it may be ſaid of them, as <hi>Valerius Aurelianus</hi> the Emperor was wont to ſay of <hi>Bonoſus</hi> a <hi>Spaniard; Such are born not to live, but to drink.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> may yield
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42873:38"/>
up their Seas of drinking, and ſtrike ſail to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> acknowledging themſelves inferiour to us in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing. Men now adayes care not, though they loſe their own good names, provided they may get new ones; as Dam-me Blades &amp; Hectors, who riſe to drink, then drink to fall: after this, ſleep of neceſſity, and ere they are half ſober, fall a drinking, and be drunk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. If any of that luxurious Sect be at this time ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, let them but liſten to the teſtimonies of learned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, &amp; they wil tel them into what bodily dangers they do plunge themſelves, by this deteſtable diſorder: For of all Diſeaſes, as <hi>Paulus Egineta</hi> affirmeth, the overcharging of the veſſels is the worſt. Wine mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately taken, increaſeth natural heat, as being its proper aliment; and ſo the beſt meats taken in the ſame manner, afford the pureſt nouriſhment. But hear what <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, laying down the dangers that follow over-Repletion, in theſe words; <hi>Eating much nouriſheth not, but fills the body with crudities and raw hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; ſtops the Pores, weakens the powers of nature, cauſeth putrefaction, mixed Feavers, ſhort breath, Sciatica of joynt aches.</hi> Of drinking thus he ſpeaks: Much drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wine in ſanguine and cholerick complexions, over-heats the blood, and cauſeth choler to ſuper-abound; and by too much Repletion of the veins and veſſels, there may follow a hot Apoplexy and ſudden death. A tragical example whereof we lately had, of two, who having drunk a very large quantity of Sack, would notwithſtanding go to the Ale-houſe; where out of a bravado they drank, in Beer, thirty Cans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece: coming home, they both inſtantly dyed. The ſuddenneſs of their death, made ſome ſuſpect that they died of the Plague; and thereupon the houſe was ſhut
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42873:39"/>
up; whereas it was no otherwiſe then a meer miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion of the true cauſe. What <hi>Avicen</hi> hath ſaid of wine, may be applyed to all other ſtrong drinks. I hope theſe lines will keep ſuch men the ſoberer in this dangerous time; and in that ſober tune, the time may touch their heart-ſtrings ſo, that ſobriety may let in religious meditations (which continual drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath lock'd out of doors) and then repentance may draw them to God, and him nearer to them, and at laſt become new creatures: which the Father for his Sons ſake grant. In the mean time, let thoſe which are well, eat the afore-preſcribed fleſh; but the ſick, the juices of them rather, becauſe aliment muſt be made more eaſie and quick for their ſupply. Let the fleſh be boyled till all the vertue of the meat be boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and then the broth to be ſtrained hard, that the fleſh may be left juiceleſs, ſo will all the ſtrength of the meat be in the broth; which you may ſpice with ſome of theſe powders following.</p>
               <p>Take of red Saunders, half an ounce; Cinnamon, three drams and half; Saffron, half a dram: make them into a fine powder.</p>
               <p>Or elſe make a powder thus:
Take of Cinnamon, half an ounce; Cloves and Saffron, of each half a dram; red Coral, two ſcruples: and the weight of all in Sugar.</p>
               <p>Let all be more ſparing in diet now, then at other times; eat little, and drink leſs; but never go out of doors faſting: But firſt, take an Antidote, of which there are ſeveral; ſome whereof, for their excellency, I ſhall here nominate.</p>

                  <p>Take of red Roſes two drams, red Saunders, red Coral, and Spodium, of each one dram; Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doary, Lignum-Aloes, Cinamon, Cloves, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron-Pill, Saffron, of each half a dram.</p>
                  <p>Sew it up in a piece of red Sarcenet, or Callico; moiſten it with a little Roſe-vinegar, ſo heat it, and apply it warm; and when it begins to be dry, moiſten it, and after the ſame manner heat it again.</p>
                  <p>Always obſerving this following direction.</p>
                  <p>When you ſuſpect a childe to have the worms in a contagious time, uſe not worm-ſeed, nor thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon trifles, but order it as in danger of infection; for that diſeaſe coming of ſo much putrefaction as it doth, is as apt to receive contagion, as tinder to take fire; give it therefore 10 or 20 grains of this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der following.</p>
                  <p>Take of Harts-horn one dram, Citron-Pill, roots of Angelica, and Tormentil, Rheubarb, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralline, of each half a dram.</p>
                  <p>Make all into a fine powder, and give the aforeſaid quantity in a little Carduus-water, ſweetned with ſome ſugar.</p>
                  <p>But you muſt be ſure to abſtain from all meat and drink for two or three hours after the taking of any of theſe Antidotes; and then eat a piece of bread and butter, ſtrewed with a piece of grated Nutmeg,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42873:41"/>
or bread and Sallet-oyl ſpiced with the powder of Tormentil-roots, or a piece of bread ſopped in white-wine, allayed with a little vinegar.</p>
                  <p>Let your dinner be about high Noon; and then eat not of above two or three ſeveral diſhes: Let your ſupper be about five or ſix in the evening, and then let one diſh ſuffice; for it is a pretty ſaying, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of obſervation: <hi>In the morning, a little is enough; at noon, enough is but a little: but at night, a little may be too much.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Go not to bed till three or four hours after ſupper, leſt ſleeping upon a full ſtomack, you hinder digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And ſo I bid good night to the ſecond point of Diet.</p>
                  <p>The third Point, is Repletion and Evacuation. When you riſe in the morning, rub your ſides, arms, thighs and legs downwards gently; your cloaths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, comb your head and rub it, hake, ſpit, and blow your noſe, to evacuate the excrements of your head and ſtomack; then aſſay to make water, and to go to ſtool, and labour to bring your body to this daily cuſtom; for the body ought eſpecially to be kept free from ſuperfluities, ſaith <hi>Galen, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de differ. treb. cap.</hi> 4. therefore if you be coſtive, uſe ſome Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory or Cliſter, and ſuffer not two whole dayes to paſs without ſuch evacuation.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary for every one (who hath ſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding) that he learn to know whether he be Phlethorick or Cachochimick: if Phlethorick (that is, full of blood, as thoſe that live in high feeding) it will appear by his high colour, full veins, pulſe greater and more frequent then it uſed ordinarily to be, purſineſs, heavineſs and dulneſs of body, and ſuch like ſignes:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42873:41"/>
if you be coſtive, take a common Cliſter firſt; then be let blood according to the appointment of ſome skilful Phyſician, and ſo ordered afterwards accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Art.</p>
                  <p>If Cacochimick, that is, full of groſs and corrupt humours (which will appear by the paleneſs and ill colour of the face, defective ſtrength, and the like) he muſt be well purged; which none but a Phyſician can ſafely preſcribe, and that upon examination of his body and urine.</p>
                  <p>But as a general Rule, all do appoint ſome purging Medicines twice or thrice in a week, to keep the body free from the increaſe of ſuperfluous humours; to which purpoſe the Pills of <hi>Ruffus</hi> (which may be had commonly in any Apothecaries ſhop) are very apt and good. But thoſe that cannot take Pills, may have this ſyrrup made for them; which for its excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in this caſe, is called, <hi>The divine Syrrup.</hi>

                  <p>Take two or three ſpoonfuls of this, more or leſs, as it works; but keep very warm, for it cauſeth ſweat as well as ſeidge. In an old Manuſcript, I finde this called St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Syrrup; the ſame a little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42873:42"/>
is in <hi>Rhenodaeus</hi> his Diſpenſatory; and he hath added two drams of Diagridium. Let men of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do as they pleaſe, I like it beſt as I have ſet it down. <hi>Rhenodaeus</hi> gives it this title, (not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Author) <hi>Syrupus qui,</hi> &amp;c. It is a ſyrrup that cleanſeth the body from ſuperfluities, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence doth ſtrengthen and comfort the heart, brain, liver, and all other members.</p>
                  <p>Always obſerving, that you muſt forbear to take this ſyrrup that morning that you take your purging Medicine.</p>
                  <p>Women with childe muſt be kept ſoluble, only with milde Suppoſitories and gentle Cliſters, wherein a little new-drawn Caſſia is to be uſed; or elſe a milde Potion, made with ſome pectoral decoction, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Caſſia; for ſtronger Purgatives will endanger abortion: but theſe ought to be directed by a good Phyſician.</p>
                  <p>Young children alſo with a Violet-comfit (for a Suppoſitory) dipped in ſweet ſallet-oyl, or elſe a little Caſſia newly drawn, diſſolved in a ſmall draught of chicken-broth; or a little Manna in the like broth, or in poſſet-drink. Beware of bathings, eſpecially in open ſtanding waters, within the Region of the air infected.</p>
                  <p>If Urine or <hi>Menſtrua</hi> ſtop, repair ſpeedily to the Phyſician for counſel: flie <hi>Venus</hi> as far as you may; for in theſe times ſhe hath but an ill name.</p>
                  <p>Sweat coming eaſily of it ſelf, and within doors, (the houſe being well aired) is good, ſo it exceed not: but abroad it is dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is good to keep open all iſſues and running ſores; becauſe nature will labour to expel any venom to ſuch a Common-ſewer.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="diet">
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:42873:42"/>The fourth Point is Exerciſe and Reſt. As it is not good for us to addict our ſelves to lazineſs, leſt we thereby increaſe thoſe ſuperfluous humours which are never wanting in bodies to foment diſeaſes; ſo neither muſt we uſe (as little as may be) too great a violence in our labours or exerciſe, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth the beſt juices we have in our bodies, and ſpoileth our radical moiſture: whereas moderate and convenient exerciſe (<hi>ad ruborem tantum, non ad ſudorem</hi>) if uſed in times and places, and ſeaſonable, doth ſtir up, nouriſh and preſerve the greateſt and beſt aſſiſtant to life, natural heats, helping concoction and evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The beſt Exerciſe is walking, with a little ſtirring of the arms; the time, in the morning; and the place, either in a pure air abroad, or in a purified air at home, in ſome large room, where is little or no company, by the heats of their bodies and breaths to diſtemper and corrupt the air. But at all times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of taking cold; for great colds and rheums do eaſily turn to putrid Feavers, and they as eaſily prove Peſtilent.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Point, is Sleep and Watching. Sleep, either immoderate or unſeaſonable, hindereth dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and cauſeth crudities, quells the vital, and dulls the animal ſpirits: Watching alſo over-much, dryes up and inflames the good blood, and weakens all the powers of nature.</p>
                  <p>Let your ſleep therefore be ſeaſonable, and not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous; not upon your dinner, unleſs cuſtom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it; and then take it but napping, for half an hour or ſo, ſitting in a chair upright.</p>
                  <p>Three hours at leaſt after a light ſupper go to bed;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42873:43"/>
where let five or ſix hours ſuffice for ſleep; lie conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently warm, the chamber-doors and windows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut to exclude the night-air: but beware of ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or lying on the ground or graſs; for the nearer the earth, the more deadly is the air. And the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſtroke of the cold vapours riſing from the ground, is very dangerous at all times.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth Point of Diet, is paſſions of the minde. All kindes of paſſion, if they be vehement, do offer violence to the ſpirits; yea, though they be of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more natural ſort.</p>
                  <p>As laughter (if unbridled) doth run even life out of breath, and greatly perplexeth the body; inſomuch as the breaſt and ſides are pained, the breath is ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſometimes the ſoul it ſelf is (as I may ſay) laughed out of her skin.</p>
                  <p>For ſo it is recorded of <hi>Chryſippus,</hi> that only upon the ſight of an Aſs eating figgs, he brake into ſuch an unmeaſurable laughter, that he fell down and died.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Zeuxis</hi> that excellent Painter (who made a moſt curious beautiful picture of the Spartan <hi>Hellen</hi>) upon the ſight of a very ill-favoured old woman, burſt out into ſuch a profuſe laughter, that he laughed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to death.</p>
                  <p>Now this is a diſeaſe of the Spleen, called <hi>Riſus Sardonius,</hi> with which there be many of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance not long ſince grieved.</p>
                  <p>But ſometimes immoderate joy lives not to the age of laughter, when it bindes the vital ſpirits ſo cloſe together, that it choaks the heart inſtantly; for ſo <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles</hi> the Tragedian, receiving a wonderful applauſe of the people for the laſt tragedy he wrote, was ſo overjoyed at it, that he became a Tragedy himſelf, and died upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:42873:43"/>The like is recorded of one <hi>Rhodias Diagoras,</hi> who when he ſaw his three ſons all at one time crowned with victory at the Olympian games, ran to meet them; and while he embraced them in his arms, and they planted their garlands on his head, he was ſo overcome with joy, that he turned their Enſignes of victory into the Penons of his Funeral.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, ſorrow afflicts the heart, diſturbs the faculties, melts the brain, vitiates the humours, and ſo weakens all the principal parts; yea, ſometimes ſinks the body into the grave.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Adraſtus</hi> King of the <hi>Argyves,</hi> being told of the death of his ſon, was taken with ſo violent ſorrow, that he fell down and died immediately.</p>
                  <p>Anger is alſo ſo furious a paſſion, that it violently diſturbs the ſpirits and faculties, as appears by the ſhaking and toſſing of the body to and fro, the fiery ſparkling of the eyes, the colour coming and going, now red, now pale; ſo that all the humours appear to be enflamed (eſpecially choler) and the ſpirits hurried this way and that way; ſometimes thruſt outward, and preſently haled in again: by which violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, an unnatural heat in the ſpirits, and corruption in the humours are ingendered. Hereupon many times follow burning Feavers, Palſies, violent Bleedings, loſs of Speech; and ſometimes Death it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nerva</hi> the Emperor being highly diſpleaſed with one <hi>Regulus,</hi> fell into ſuch fury againſt him, that he was ſtricken therewith into a Feaver; whereof he died within a few dayes after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in a rage conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Cup-bearer, would needs kill him preſently with his own hand; but his indeavour was his own
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42873:44"/>
deaths-man, ſtriking him with a Palſey, that ſhook him ſhortly after into aſhes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Valentinianus</hi> the Emperor, in a fierce fury, would needs deſtroy the whole Country of <hi>Sarmatia</hi>; but his unruly rage brake a vein within, and his own life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood ended his bloody deſign.</p>
                  <p>Fear likewiſe gathers the heat and ſpirits to the heart, and diſſolves the brain, making the moiſture thereof ſhed and ſlide down into the external parts, cauſing a chilneſs and ſhaking over all the body; and falling upon the gullet, makes one to ſwallow when they ſhould ſpeak: It abuſes the fancy and ſences, brings a Lethargy upon the organs of motion, and condemns the heart to deadly ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Caſſander</hi> the ſon of <hi>Antipater,</hi> upon the ſight of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great's Statue, was ſtricken with ſuch a terror, that he could hardly make his legs leave trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, ſo much as to carry him out of the place. This Fear hath in it a very ſtrange operation, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reav'd ſeveral of their ſenſes, on others diſeaſes; as a Feaver, &amp;c. which Feaver hath afterwards turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Plague; ſo that this Fear, though it doth not ariſe from danger of infection, yet it will draw it on: how much more then doth the fear of the ſame cauſe work it? Inſtead of bringing Examples for the proof hereof, I ſhall only give you a Reaſon for it Fear, of all Paſſions, is the moſt peſtilently pernicious; for it enforceth the vital ſpirits to retire inward to the heart; by which retiring, they leave the outward parts infirm: as appears by the paleneſs and trembling of one in great fear. So that the <hi>Walls</hi> being forſaken (which are continually beſieged by the outward air) in comes the <hi>Enemy</hi> boldly; the beſt <hi>ſpirits</hi> that ſhould
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42873:44"/>
expel them, having <hi>cowardly ſounded a retreat</hi>: In which withdrawing, they draw in with them ſuch evil va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours as hang about the outward Pores, even as the Sun draws towards it the vapours of the Earth. And hence it is, that fear brings infection ſooner then any other occaſion. This therefore, and all other paſſions, by a wiſe watching over our ſelves, be <hi>beaten</hi> off, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they but offer to <hi>ſet</hi> upon us. But theſe are <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes</hi> of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> whoſe <hi>Phyſicians</hi> are <hi>Divines.</hi> They muſt <hi>purge</hi> out the <hi>love</hi> of this <hi>world,</hi> and the diſtruſt of Gods providence; miniſter the <hi>Cordials</hi> of <hi>Faith, Hope, Patience</hi> and <hi>Contentedneſs</hi>; and ordain the ſtrict <hi>Diet</hi> of <hi>holy Exerciſes.</hi> We that are <hi>Phyſicians</hi> to the <hi>Body,</hi> are but <hi>Chyrurgions</hi> to the <hi>Soul</hi>; we can but talk of <hi>Topical</hi> Remedies.</p>

               <p>ITs uſuall manner is, at the firſt infection, to ſtrike at the heart, which is apparent by the ſinking and languiſhing of the vital faculties; the whole ſtrength of the body is likewiſe ſuddenly turned into weakneſs, the <hi>vital ſpirits</hi> being greatly oppreſſed and diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: whereas the <hi>animal</hi> faculty commonly remains (for a while) in good plight, and perfect in the uſe of <hi>Senſe, Understanding, Judgement, Memory, and Motion.</hi> The <hi>Natural faculty</hi> alſo is not ſo preſently hurt, but there is <hi>concoction</hi> and all other functions performed by the <hi>Liver, Stomack, Guts, Reins, Bladder,</hi> and other
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42873:45"/>
parts, as <hi>nature</hi> requires: though indeed in a little time (the venom being very ſtrong) theſe and the <hi>brain</hi> are alſo overcome; as appears by the ſymptoms that follow, as <hi>Lethargies, Frenzies, Vomitings, Fluxes,</hi> &amp;c. Take notice therefore, that as ſoon as the venemous matter ſtrikes to the heart, the Contagion hath now found out the <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>vital parts,</hi> who, if he want <hi>armour of proof</hi> to reſiſt (either of natural ſtrength, or forged out by <hi>Arts Cyclops,</hi> the Phyſician) is preſently taken <hi>Priſoner</hi> by his <hi>venemous enemy</hi>; who ſoon after, takes poſſeſſion of the arteries and veins. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, the <hi>Pulſe</hi> (which uſeth to be the <hi>trueſt intelligences</hi> of the <hi>heart's</hi> well or ill fare) becomes now languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, little, frequent, and unequal. <hi>Languiſhing,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that native heat leſſens, and a heat contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture increaſeth; <hi>little,</hi> becauſe oppreſſed; <hi>frequent,</hi> from natures ſtrife; <hi>unequal,</hi> partly from the Fever, and partly from the malignant vapour that beſiegeth the heart. Concerning the Pulſe, thus writes <hi>Rodericus à Caſtro,</hi> concerning the Plague that was at <hi>Hambrough: Manus duns Medico porrigunt Pulſum, quodam modo retrahuntur cum tremore; quod à veneno ſit cor ipſum pungente, &amp; ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num mihi diutina experientia indubitatum eſt, ut eo ſolo ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſsime peſtilentem affectum cognoverim</hi>; That he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſick ſtretching out their hands to the Phyſician to feel their Pulſe, they would after a certain manner pull them back again with trembling, which might be from the venom pricking the very heart; which was an undoubted ſigne (he ſaith) by daily experience, by which alone he oftentimes knew a perſon infected pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilentially. From this ground did I finde another that never failed me: If in reaching out the hand the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſigne appeared not, then if I ſuſpected it to be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42873:45"/>
the Plague, I would touch the Pulſe ſomething hard; and if it were the Plague, the hand would not fail to tremble and twitch back. The reaſon is, the ſtopping of the courſe of the pulſe, drives the venom ſomething back to the heart, by which is cauſed a kind of ſudden Paſſion. The next <hi>ſigne,</hi> is the <hi>enemies Enſigne</hi> hung out at the <hi>windows,</hi> the eyes I mean; for then they will be various in turning, and ſometimes fiery ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; the looks ſad, and the face changing colour: which ſhew that the radical humours begin to vaſte, and the ſpirits to wax dry and enflamed. Then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>lightneſs</hi> or <hi>giddineſs</hi> of the head; <hi>drowth,</hi> and <hi>bitter taſte</hi> in the mouth, which proceed from the ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of choler, aggravated by the mixture of the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vapours: vomiting likewiſe of vicious matter, being (according to the redency of any of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours) of <hi>flegme,</hi> ſometimes wateriſh; of <hi>choler,</hi> ſometimes yellow or greeniſh; of <hi>melancholy,</hi> leaden or blackiſh. But this is from the virulency of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, vexing the <hi>veins</hi> and <hi>fibres</hi> in the <hi>coat</hi> of the <hi>ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack</hi>; not from any ſtrength of nature to expel the poyſon, as it appeareth, in that no eaſe, but encreaſe of accidents ſucceedeth the exoneration: after w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> follows a painful convulſion or hicket, by the progreſs of the venom working convulſively on the fibres of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack; ſhortneſs of breath alſo, and often ſighing, ſhew the heart is inflamed, and would fain exchange the over-heated air within the body, for that which is cool without: then the ſpirits begin to faint and ſink through the fierce gripe of the venemous vapour that now inſults over the yielding heart. The external parts become cold and chill, while the internal are all over-hot with the inflammation of the bowels. By
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42873:46"/>
By this time the venom is gotten up into the watriſh humouts of the <hi>brain,</hi> and infecting them, cauſeth <hi>head-ach,</hi> whiles the hot vapours (getting between the two mother-membranes) cauſe painful prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings there: whereupon followeth reſtleſsneſs of the body, and <hi>lack of ſleep</hi>; and upon theſe <hi>frenzie,</hi> except the brain be full of moiſture; and the head is over-heavy and <hi>Lethargick</hi>; ſometimes alſo the venom works it ſelf from the ſubſtance of the brain into the <hi>ſinews,</hi> cauſing <hi>cramps</hi> and <hi>convulſions.</hi> The <hi>urine</hi> is altogether untrue, therefore unworthy the fellowſhip of faithful ſignes; and the moſt faithful, are the <hi>ſores</hi> and <hi>ſpots</hi> (if they be right) called <hi>Gods Tokens.</hi> But before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to deſcribe them, give me leave to expreſs my ſorrow, for what I had daily obſervation of abroad amongſt unskilful Phyſicians, who frequently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the cure of the <hi>Plague,</hi> who knew no more then to ſweat the Patient, and apply outward drawing Medicines to the <hi>ſores,</hi> without knowing theſe ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes here ſpecified, abſolutely material to the cure; without the knowledge of which, many a poor ſoul doth periſh: All which I ſhall here reckon up, to ſee if I can deter <hi>impudent Practitioners,</hi> who dare without learning to enrich themſelves, by filling graves and fatning Church-yards.</p>

                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:42873:47"/>And not one of theſe <hi>ſymptoms</hi> can be cured by the common <hi>Method</hi> of ſuch caſes, becauſe of the <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous quality</hi> is mixed with them. But when I had well informed my ſelf of theſe things, and ſaw how little they were regarded by others, I was much amazed to ſee, with what peaceable conſciences ſome men went a killing: And I began to doubt, whether it were not better for a man to be at peace <hi>with ignorance,</hi> then to carry his trembling heart in his hand, as I did all that time: yet ſtill it pleaſed God to bleſs my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and counſels; ſo that in what place ſoever I came into, which was infected, a very ſmall number failed under my advice. But to go forward. I muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my ſelf a little in the diſcovery of the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and moſt apparent ſignes (which are <hi>the Botch, the Blain, the Carbuncle, and the Spots, called Gods Tokens</hi>) becauſe the Searchers do ſometimes miſtake. The <hi>Botch</hi> is a hard <hi>tumour,</hi> riſing in the glandulous parts, called the <hi>Emunctories</hi>; which are in three places on each ſide of the body, <hi>viz. under each ear</hi> (or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under <hi>the jaws or chin</hi>) in the <hi>arm-pits, and in the groynes.</hi> This tumour lies ſometimes very deep in the fleſh, only to be found by feeling; nay, ſometimes alſo ſcarcely to be felt: but if you touch the place, there is pain. But for the moſt part, it ſwelleth out to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Nutmeg or Wall-nut; yea, even to the ſize of a mans fiſt: alſo ſometimes it is round, ſometimes oval, ſometimes long and ſlender as ones finger. I have ſeen a Lad of ten years old, that had one riſen in his left arm-pit, which ran from thence backward to the ſhoulder-blade, making a ſemicircle thereon; and ſo turning downward towards the back-bone, as if under the skin had been laid a good big cord, in the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42873:47"/>
form almoſt of a circle; the youth was not heart-ſick but at the firſt taking: and it ſo pleaſed God to bleſs the means I applied, that this tumour ſunk again, and vaniſhed without any ſuppuration. But ſome again, are flat, broad, and ſpreading, even over half the breaſt, which I have ſeen; they are of colour various, according the humour predominant at the firſt; it is commonly moveable, but grows afterwards more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and fixed: it riſeth for the moſt part with a pricking pain; and as it grows greater, is more dully painful, and ſeems to the Patient as a weight or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. It cometh of a venemous matter, putrifying and poyſoning the blood, which is thick, groſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious of it ſelf, and ſomething flegmatick: Nature therefore ſtrives to drive forth this venom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Emunctories, which are the ſinks and recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of excrementitious humours. When they riſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the jaws, they ſhew the ſtrength of the brain; the arm-pits, of the heart; and in the groynes, of the Liver. According to the quantity of the humour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, ſo the Botches are bigger or leſſer, and more or fewer in number: and according to the malignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the humour, are their colours whiter, redder, more bluiſh or blackiſh; whereof the later are ſtill the worſe. The Blain is a kinde of Bliſter, ſomewhat like one of the Swine-pox, of a ſtraw-colour for the moſt part, but ſometimes of a bluiſh or leaden co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but then it is apt to turn to a Carbuncle; and when it runneth, affords filthy matter of the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. Round about the Bliſter there is a red fiery circle (yet nothing ſo fiery as that of the Carbuncle) the whole taking up the bredth of a groat or ſix-pence: I have ſeen of the breadth of a large ſhilling, but very
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42873:48"/>
rarely. Theſe will riſe in any part of the body or limbes, ſometimes one, two, or three, but never many: when the matter is run out, the skin falls, and dries up to a ruſty ſcab, and ſo falls off. Theſe ſhew, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſtrong to expel the venom ſpeedily, and that the humours infected are not ſuperabundant; for many that have theſe are not ſick at all, and the moſt recover by good looking to. The Carbuncle is a little vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous puſtle, with a broad compaſs of a deep redneſs upon it, wonderful angry, and burning like a fire-coal; thence comes his name, <hi>Carbunculus.</hi> It riſeth like a Bliſter, producing an aſh-colour'd, or elſe a blackiſh cruſt; ſometimes it riſes in many puſtles like burnt bliſters on the outward skin, which being broken, and the matter run out, the like cruſty eſcar grows over it till it falls off. It appears in any part of the body or limbes, many times on the breaſt, and ſometimes in the face: with it alwayes go theſe evil companions, itching, inflammation and eroſion; for it is ſo full of burning poyſon, that it conſumes the fleſh, and will in a ſhort time, if it be not well lookt to, eat ſo deep and large a hole, as if the fleſh were hollowed with an hot iron. It riſeth from the ſame cauſe in the Botch, but the blood is more hot, black, thick, and feculent, proceeding from burnt choler, or aduſt melancholy. The Spots, otherwiſe called <hi>Gods Tokens,</hi> are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the bigneſs of a flea-bitten ſpot, ſometimes much bigger; their colour is according to the predominancy of the humour in the body; red or reddiſh, if choler; pale blue, or dark blue, if flegm; leaden or blackiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if melancholy abound; but, they have ever a circle about them: The red ones a purpliſh circle, and the others a reddiſh circle: they appear moſt commonly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42873:48"/>
on the breaſt and back, and ſometimes on the neck, arms and thighs; on the breaſt and back, becauſe the vital ſpirits ſtrive to breath out the venom the neareſt way. In ſome bodies there will be very many; in ſome, but one or two, or very few, according to the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the venom, and the ſtrength to drive them out. They uſually ſhew themſelves on the third, fourth, fifth, or ſeventh day; ſometimes not till death, the venom yet tyrannizing over the dead carcaſe: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they appear together with the ſores, but for the moſt part without: the cauſe is, the venemous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condenſed and hardned in the act of penetrating the Pores of the skin: if they be skilfully diſſected in the dead body, you may finde ſome half way, deep in the fleſh; and ſome in the muſcles of the breaſt have been followed with the Inciſion-knife, even to the rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones. The reaſon why they are thus congealed is, the thickneſs of the venemous matter, and the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it; for it is the moſt flegmatick part of the blood, yet mixed alſo with the other humours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the colours. They appear in dead bodies moſt, becauſe nature fainting in her labour to thruſt out the venom through the skin, life's hear going out, the privation thereof, and the nearneſs of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward air do congeal them preſently: and becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times at the laſt gaſpe Nature gives the ſtouteſt ſtruggle, it comes to paſs they are not ſo far thruſt forth as to appear till death. All theſe ſymptoms muſt be lookt to very diligently and skilfully.</p>
