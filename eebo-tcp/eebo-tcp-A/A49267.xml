         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Rebels ſtomacking the
loſſe of ſo faire a booty as
that by Gods aſſiſtance we
layd hold on in the Caſtle
of <hi>Eniskenning</hi> caſt about to
meet with us ſome other
way, and ſeeing that here
in or about <hi>Dublin,</hi> or as
farre as either our workes
or our fortifications ſtretch,
we are not onely God bee
thanked ſo well provided,
but ſo wary that little good is to be done upon us by Land,
they attempted to miſchiefe us by Sea, and on Munday laſt,
the laſt of this moneth, between two and three of the clock
in the morning. J ſuppoſe, hoping to have found us, as faſt
aſleepe as we had them, two hundred of them, in a kind of
homely clouterly Shallop, made and contrived in haſt, as
ſhould ſeem only for this deſign, came up with the Tyde that
then ſerved in among our Ships, even to the midſt of them
in the Harbour vndeſcryed, being well acquainted with
their Country Fogs, and how to make advantage by them,
there were amongſt others three Ships lately come from
<hi>ENGLAND</hi> two laden with Meale, one with Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
but ſee the goodneſſe of God ſtill continued towards
us, for which we are more deeply bound to extoll and
<pb facs="tcp:64728:3"/>
magnifie his mercy towards us, the Ship with Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lay in the reare of the other, and was paſſed by of them
either vnſeene (it being a mighty Fogge, beſides the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the night) or miſtaken, not thought, or underſtood
by them to be the Ship they looked for, thinking as well
they might, that ſhe lay as neare the Key as poſſible could
be for Covert and ſafeguard.</p>
            <p>They comming in but that Sunday night late, and could
not be unloaded poſſibly till morning, had the Rebels made
up with this Ship called the <hi>Draggon of Cheſter,</hi> and plyed
her, with Fire-Balls; yea and with Granadoes, as alſo with
little drie Willow Faggots, all daubd over with Pitch and
Rozen, which flew like Fire-Drakes into the ſaid Ships, had
they in this manner greeted that Ship, as they did theirs,
as it was the onely ſweet and mercifull providence of God
that they ſhould not, they had by all likelyhood done us a
mighty diſpleaſure, the Ship having in it 16. laſt of Powder,
beſide Bullets, Muskets, Pikes, and other Ammunition, as
alſo Pioners tooles, <hi>viz.</hi> Spades, Shovels, Mattocks, Wheele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Barrowes,
and the like Inſtruments, whereof the City ſtood
in great need but eſpecialy of the Powder, there being not
onely a ſcarcity thereof in the City at that time, but almoſt
a want: Whileſt the enemies were thus buſie about the
Ships, the Maſters and Marriners were not idle, playing
not onely with their Ordnance, which indeed did little
harme, or rather none at all unto the Rebels, ſhooting over
them, but likewiſe with their ſmall ſhot, whereof they had
ſuch ſtore, and beſtowed it ſo liberall amongſt them, that
the Rebels durſt not board them, which queſtionleſſe was
their intent, but plyed us hot with their Fire-worke,
whereof we wondred at their plenty, this <hi>Bickering</hi> in the
Harbour which now had continued well nigh an houre, at laſt
was heard of in the City, and the ſtate thought as well they
might, that all was not well there; whereupon the Alarum
was all the City thorough, being ſo much terrible for that it
<pb facs="tcp:64728:3"/>
was night, my Maſter Sir <hi>Charles</hi> drew downe unto the
Key with 500. foote, whether once come; we plainly
heard what the matter was by the cryes and clamou<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
from the ſhips. Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> conceiving the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and how, that without doubt the Rebels had
notice of the arrivall of theſe three Ships, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they were laden, thought there was no dallying,
but preſent to worke, whereupon he commanded all
the Ships and Barkes about the Key, immediately to
lanch their Boates, which done; he cauſed as many Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers
as could poſſibly with convenience, man the
Boates without let either to themſelves, or to thoſe
that ſhould row forthwith to enter, which was done,
and the Boates being in number 11. wee ſtowed in them
140 men, &amp; into the Harbour amongſt them we came
and in very good time, for the Rebels had boorded
one of the Meale Ships, being to ſtrong in number for
the Saylors who were in all but tenne, and ſome fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
Souldiers wee made bould to enter the Ship
upon them, and wee with the Saylors helpe, and
they with ours, made ſhift, and quickly quit the Ship
of them, ſending them ſome alive and ſome dead, a
breakefaſt unto the Fiſhes, the Seamen in the Harbour
perceiving that wee were there, left their Ships, tooke
both their Boates, and courages, and in amongſt us;
with this ſupply the Rebells were ſoone under water,
whom we ſuppoſed by their attemps and tumult in the
Harbour, to have beene a farre greater number then we
found them, for by all deſcrie and gueſſe, they could
not be above two hundred, and by all conjecture, their
comming was to fire the Ships which brought over
this laſt ſupply of Ammuniton, and other Engines as
is afore rehearſed, as did manifeſtely appeare by the
nature of the preparation they brought along with
them, but God be prayſed we are delivered of that
feare now, the Ammunition on Munday morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

10. &amp; 11. of the clock being all ſafely Landed, and
conveigh'd into the Caſtle, yet tis not all ſo well as it
ſhould be, the ſweete of our ſucceſſe is againe mingled
with drugs of unexpected feares, and ſuſpitious dangers;
for foure Aldermen are againe miſſing in <hi>Dublin,</hi> who
are gone without taking leave of ſome that I beleeve
had they known of their going, would not ſo eaſily have
parted with their companie, their names are <hi>Peter
Welſh, Dominicke Rutter, Rabert Mahun, Patricke
Ovannian,</hi> who ſcaped on Saturday night, it is ſayd in
womans apparell, under pretence of Soldiers wives or
Trulls, to carrie victuals to their husbands, or Servants
upon their guards in the out Works, for the other three
I know not what correſpondency they might have
with the Feminine gender in any particular, but for
<hi>Rutter,</hi> in womans apparell, he might paſſe for one ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well without mufling, for I beleeve his beard and
his eyes would come out together, being neare three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore,
and not a haire on his face, being called the old
woman of <hi>Dublin,</hi> they are gone with head and hoofe,
having left nothing behind them valuable, that was
portable, which proves that they had good helpe, and
faire time, to make ſuch a cleanely conveyance, the
Lords Juſtices have ſeazed their houſes, and two Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralls
with ſixe common Soldiers, are in Priſon cloſe
chopped up about their eſcape, and pray God, good
proofe be not brought that they are fouly guilty of it,
which if it ſhall, they ſhall all <hi>(Sir Simon Harcourt</hi> ſwears)
fayrely truſſe for it, ſeeing the Rebels now lye round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Citie, in all quarters, to the number of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
or ſixteene Thouſands, theſe Aldermen may give
light unto the Rebels, where the Citie may be moſt ſeiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
it alſo puts the Commanders both of State, and
Warre, into a grounded jealouſie that they have ſtrong
intelligence in the Citie, which cauſeth <hi>Sir Simon Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi>
to put upon his out-Worke, none but his owne
<pb facs="tcp:64728:4"/>
Souldiers which he brought out of England with him,
whom he thinkes he may boldly confide in, and lyes
himſelfe in the out Workes, the Rebells neare the
Citie under another of the Barres, the Baſtard <hi>Orocke,</hi>
and <hi>Perigrine Oneale,</hi> are no leſſe then Nine or Tenne
Thouſand ſtrong Eaſtward, their is another Power
Weſtward, at the head of <hi>Hoath,</hi> under the command
of the Baſtard <hi>Muskery,</hi> but of what number is not yet
knowne.</p>
            <p>That J ſhall goe neare to write at the next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
when J write you the iſſue of the eight Soldiers,
how they will come off about the eſcape of the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
we have in Dublin ſome ſixe Thouſand men, able
expetienced, and well appoynted: yea and well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for by the State, and their Commanders, if ever
Soldiers were, wanting neither meat, drinke, nor
Cloathes fit for men, yea and for honeſt men, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are as hard put to it for devoir and ſeruice,
in watching and Centinels, J thinke as ever Soldiers
were, and indeed it is but need as now the caſe ſtands,
for queſtionleſſe the Rebels ſhoote at the getting of this
Citie, by their drawing into ſo great bodies ſo nigh the
Citie in divers places, and cutting us off from all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
by land, and were it not that we have our Ships
continually active in the Harbour, and have built two
good Sconces lately to better ſecure our entrance, and
ſafe egreſſe into it, they would have gone neare to have
rayſed them for us, wherefore we find the benefit of
being aforehand.</p>
