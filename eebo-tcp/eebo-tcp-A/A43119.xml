         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nay, I will ſay more; 'tis the true Intereſt of his <hi>Holineſs</hi> himſelf, and the <hi>Roman Clergy,</hi> to curb the growing gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of ſuch an <hi>haughty</hi> Monarch. 'Tis not a <hi>Fable</hi> of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Delegated power that will keep him in <hi>awe,</hi> when <hi>Maſter of Europe,</hi> who long ſince ruffled <hi>Old Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,</hi> Hector'd the <hi>Conclave,</hi> and made truckling <hi>Rome</hi> Erect publickly to his glory, <hi>a Pillar</hi> of her own Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.

            </p>
            <p>Yet hitherto we have gone on and <hi>proſpered;</hi> for we believe that what others call <hi>violence,</hi> is but a juſt Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that Conquerors ought to provide for the future, by deſtroying whatever may hurt them: That we ought to acknowledge no <hi>Law</hi> but the <hi>Sword;</hi> the Appetite of Governing, and the glory to be had of Aggrandizing our ſelves at the Coſt of our Neighbours. That <hi>Piety</hi> is not a Quality for a Prince, and <hi>Pity</hi> a Cowardly Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which overthrows a Crown, whoſe beſt ſupport we ſay is <hi>Fear,</hi> and Impiety its Foundation.

do not gain <hi>Subjects,</hi> but more <hi>Companions of Slavery;</hi> and do but make our <hi>Chains</hi> more <hi>glittering</hi> and ſtrong, not at all <hi>lighter</hi> or more eaſie. Our <hi>Princes of the Blood</hi> have been forced to truckle and be obſervant to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt degree of Adulation. Our Miniſters of State meer <hi>ſpunges,</hi> that firſt ſuckt up the <hi>vital Spirits</hi> of the Commonalty, and then were <hi>ſqueezed</hi> to repleniſh with ill gotten Prey the Royal Coffers. But above all, the poor <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whom we nick-name <hi>Hugenotes,</hi> have endured with incredible patience, all kind of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, had any of them a Suit in Law, how juſt ſoever his Cauſe, it was thought Merit <hi>to Caſt</hi> him, meerly for his Religion, without the leaſt charge of <hi>Diſloyalty</hi> or Misbehaviour; they have been made uncapable of any Office or Preferment; their <hi>Academies</hi> deſtroyed, their <hi>Temples</hi> generally demoliſht, and all their <hi>Liberties,</hi> both as <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> though confirmed by ſolemn <hi>Edicts,</hi> and repeated Vows, Invaded, Abridged, and Annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding all theſe Uſurpations, we now begin to hope the day of <hi>our Redemption</hi> from Slavery draws near, and that Providence will break thoſe <hi>Chains,</hi> which ſo long have been  <hi>preparing</hi> for Chriſtendom. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monarchy hath for ſome Ages been <hi>a Stone,</hi> that hath cruſht to pieces all that have attempted it: The<hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family were long lifting at it: But how ſtrangely were their Hopes defeated! And ſome ſuch Cataſtrophe ſeems at preſent to threaten all our Endeavors.<hi>Our Babel-builders</hi>are like to be Confounded amongſt themſelves. A moſt Helliſh Device is lately Diſcovered of POYSONING, wherein a multitude of Perſons of the Higheſt Quality, are found to be concerned. Not to tire you with a Liſt of <hi>Ladies</hi>Names, that are none of your Acquaintance, and who have followed this horrid Trade for many Years, whereby<hi>Thouſands</hi> in this City have been made away; Let it ſuffice to tell you, that the famous <hi>Luxemburg,</hi>under whom you did ſuch ſignal Services, when lately he was <hi>General</hi> of our Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> is Charged as an <hi>Accomplice,</hi> and ſecured; many others are fled, a great Number taken into Cuſtody:

Nor can any body here imagine, where the Diſcovery of the late erected <hi>Chamber of Juſtice</hi> will end. This is generally concluded, that Perſons of their Quality would never engage in ſuch a matter, without ſome <hi>great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,</hi> which is ſuppoſed to aim at no leſs than a Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Government. This fills our
