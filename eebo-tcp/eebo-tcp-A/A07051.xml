            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>For first the Ape delights with moppes and mowes,</l>

               <l>This iesting Iacke that no good manner knowes,</l>
               <l>With his Asse hee les presumes all states to strike.</l>

               <l>Sometimes his chappes do walke in poynts too hie,</l>
               <l>Wherein the Ape himselfe a Woodcock tries:</l>
               <l>Sometimes with floutes he drawes his mouth awrie,</l>
               <l>And sweares by his ten bones, and falselie lies.</l>
               <l>Wherefore be what he will I do not passe,</l>
               <l>He is the paltriest Ape that euer was.</l>

               <l>Such rangings, ragings, reuelings, roysters ray,</l>
               <l>With so foule mouth, and knaue at euery catch,</l>

               <l>Now out he runnes with Cuckowe king of May,</l>
               <l>Then in he leapes with a wild Morrice daunce;</l>
               <l>Then strikes he vp Dame <hi>Lawsens</hi> lustie lay;</l>
               <l>Then comes Sir <hi>Ieffries</hi> ale tub tapde by chaunce:</l>
               <l>Which makes me gesse, (and I can shrewdly smell)</l>
               <l>He loues both t'one and t'other passing well.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But <hi>Martin,</hi> why in matters of such waight</l>

               <l>Beware yee states and Nobles of this Lande,</l>
               <l>The Clergie is but one of these mens butts:</l>
               <l>The Ape at last on masters necke will stande,</l>
               <l>Then gegge betime these gaping greedie gutts.</l>
               <l>Least that too soone, and then too late ye feele,</l>
               <l>He strikes at head that first began with heele.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The third tricke is; what Apes by flattering waies</l>
               <l>Cannot come by, with biting they will snatch:</l>
               <l>Our <hi>Martin</hi> makes no bones, but plainely saies,</l>
               <l>Their fists shall walke, they will both bite and scratch.</l>
               <l>He'il make their harts to ake, and will not faile,</l>
               <l>Where pen cannot their penknife shall preuaile.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But this is false, he saith he did but mock:</l>
               <l>A foole he was, that so his words did scanne.</l>
               <l>He onely ment with Pen their pates to knocke:</l>
               <l>A knaue he is, that so turnes cat in pan.</l>
               <l>But <hi>Martin</hi> sweare and stare, as deepe as Hell,</l>
               <l>Thy sprite thy spite and mischeuous minde doth tell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The thing that neither Pope with booke nor Bull,</l>
               <l>Nor Spanish King with ships could doe without.</l>
               <l>Our <hi>Martins</hi> heere at home will worke at full;</l>
               <l>If Prince curbe not betimes that rabble rout.</l>
               <l>That is destroy both Church, and State, and all;</l>
               <l>For if t'one faile, the other needs must fall.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thou <hi>England</hi> then whome God doth make so glad,</l>
               <l>Through Gospels grace and Princes prudent raigne:</l>
               <l>Take heede least thou at last be made as sad,</l>
               <l>Through <hi>Martins</hi> makebates marring, to thy paine.</l>
               <l>For he marrs all and maketh nought, nor will:</l>
               <l>Saue lies and strife, and works for <hi>Englands</hi> ill.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And ye graue men that answere <hi>Martins</hi> mowes,</l>
               <l>He mocks the more, and you in vaine loose times:</l>
               <l>Leaue Apes to doggs to baite, their skins to crowes,</l>
               <l>And let old <hi>Lanam</hi> lashe him with his rimes.</l>
               <l>The beast is proud when men wey his enditings:</l>
               <l>Let his workes goe the waie of all wast writings.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:12652:4"/>
               <l>Now <hi>Martin,</hi> you that say you will spawne out</l>
               <l>Your broyling brattes, in euery towne to dwell;</l>
               <l>We will prouide in each place for your route,</l>
               <l>A bell and whippe that Apes do loue so well.</l>
               <l>And if ye skippe and will not wey the checke,</l>
               <l>Wei'l haue a springe and catch you by the necke.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And so adiew mad <hi>Martin</hi> marre the land,</l>
               <l>Leaue off thy worke, and more work, hearest thou me:</l>
               <l>Thy work's nought worth, take better worke in hand:</l>
               <l>Thou marr'st thy worke, &amp; thy work will marre thee.</l>
               <l>Worke not a newe, least it doth worke thy wracke,</l>
               <l>And then make worke for him that worke doth lacke.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And this I warne thee Martins Monckies face,</l>
               <l>Take heed of me, my rime doth charme thee bad:</l>
               <l>I am a rimer of the Irish race,</l>
               <l>And haue alreadie rimde thee staring mad.</l>
               <l>But if thou ceasest not thy bald iests still to spread,</l>
               <l>Ile neuer leaue, till I haue rimde thee dead.</l>
