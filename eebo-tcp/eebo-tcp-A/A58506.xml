            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REMARQUES UPON M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> PALMES'S ANSWER TO S<hi rend="sup">IR</hi> RICHARD TEMPLE'S CASE</head>
            <p n="1">1st. MR. <hi>Palmes</hi> having agreed with Sr. <hi>Richard Temple</hi>'s Caſe, that the <hi>Point</hi> in Queſtion, referred to the <hi>Committee,</hi> was; in whom the Poſſeſſion remained at the meeting of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> of the place where the Breach of Privilledge complained of, by both Parties was done: To prove it to be in him, he Alledges, that all the Lands in Queſtion, were the Lands of Mrs. <hi>Danby,</hi> who Dyed without Iſſue; but takes no Notice that ſhe had Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Inheritance thereof to Sr. <hi>Richard Temple,</hi> and given him Poſſeſſion in 1686, according to the Deed of Mortgage; and that Sr. <hi>Richard</hi> had received three half Years Rent before Mrs. <hi>Danbys</hi> Death: And was in the peaceable Poſſeſſion till the 14th. of <hi>March</hi> laſt. And as to Mr. <hi>Palms</hi>'s pretended Attornment, it was not of all the Tennants; but only of one in ſix, that had any Intereſt in the Land in Queſtion.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. As to the Delivery of any Leaſes of <hi>Ejectment,</hi> tho' it was alleadged at the <hi>Committee,</hi> yet no ſuch thing was proved: For in truth what <hi>Ejectments</hi> were delivered, were for part of the Jointure Lands, which ſell lately; and not the Lands now in Queſtion: So that Mr. <hi>Palms</hi> hath no Colour for his Pretences, that Sr. <hi>Richard</hi> was out of Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Whether the 21 Perſons that came with 7 Teems Forceably to enter upon, and Plough the <hi>Middle Feild,</hi> or thoſe three complained of, that endeavoured only to defend the Poſſeſſion, and hinder their Ploughs, were the Ryoters and Breakers of Priviledges, is Submitted to every Mans Judgment.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. As to the falſe Suggeſtion, that the Attornment of the Tennants to Sr. <hi>Richard Temple</hi> was to avoid Creditors; he appeals to the <hi>Committee,</hi> whither any ſuch thing was to avoid Creditors; he appeals to the <hi>Committee,</hi> whither any ſuch thing was proved, or ſo much as mentioned there, but the Mortgage admitted to be good.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. And as to the Specious Offers, pretended by him to be made to Sr. <hi>Richard Temple</hi> 'tis to be obſerved, that in Caſes of Ryots and Forceable Entries, there is no Priviledge of <hi>Parliament;</hi> all the Parties on both ſides being bound over to Anſwer it, there was no need of Waver of Priviledge, or troubling the <hi>Houſe</hi> about it; and if the deſigned to obtein any Complyances by thoſe Methods, ſurely he was in a very Improper and Unreaſonable Way.</p>
            <p>But he knowing the Equity of Redemption, was given from him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; therefore he tries all ways to compaſs the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> and <hi>Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berances,</hi> to defeate him and the <hi>Creditors</hi> and <hi>Legatees,</hi> which Sr. <hi>Richard</hi> neither in Honour, nor in Juſtice can comply with.</p>
            <p>That the laſt <hi>Note</hi> is both falſe and frivilouſe, ſince the Attornment was purſuant to the Deed, and the Agreements therein; and the former Mortgage aſſigned, was in the ſame manner; but the Poſſeſſion as well as the Attornment, and the Receipt of the Rents being proved; Sr. <hi>Richard</hi>'s Attornment was never queſtioned, nor indeed material: But Mr. <hi>Palme</hi>'s Pretence for the Poſſeſſion, was only the Attornment of one of the ſix Tennants; and Mr. <hi>Palmes</hi> having no Eſtate in Law, only an Equity of Redemption, could not be good or effectual to our Sr. <hi>Richard</hi> of his Poſſeſſion.</p>
