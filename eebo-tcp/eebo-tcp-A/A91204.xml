            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen, and Fellow Commoners,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>VVHereas my ſelf, and above 200 Members more being forcibly ſecluded from ſiting in the houſe of Commons, by the Officers of the Army, I therefore held it my duty, to impart unto you theſe enſuing Propoſals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:116999:3"/>
Firſt, That by the common law of the Realm, the ſtat. of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and all other Acts concerning Treaſon, it is no leſſe then high treaſon for any man to compaſſe or imagine the depoſition or death of the King, or of his eldeſt Sonne and heire, though it be never executed, much more if actually accompliſhed, and that many have been arraigned, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and executed, for ſuch intended treaſons in ſormer ages, as the E. of <hi>Arundell,</hi> and others, by judgment in Parl.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That in the Oath of Allegiance whlch you have all taken, immediatly before your admiſſion into the houſe as Members; You do truly and ſincerely acknowledge, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, teſtifie and declare in your conſciences, before God &amp; the World, That our Soveraign Lord King <hi>Charles,</hi> is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and rightfull King of this Realme, and of all other his Maj. Dominions and Countries.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That your ſelves, among other members, have in above one hundred Remonſtrances and Declarations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, both to the King himſelf, kingdom, world, &amp; forraign States, that you never intended the leaſt hurt, injury, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the Kings perſon, Crown, Dignity, or Poſterity; but intended to him and his Royal poſterity, more honour, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>atneſſe, and glory, then ever was yet enjoyed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Predeceſſors, that you have propoſed no other ends to your ſelves, but the performance of all duty and loyalty to his Maj. perſon, That his perſonal ſafety, honour, &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, are much dearer to you then your own lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, which you do moſt heartily dedicate, and ſhall moſt willingly imploy for the maintenance and ſupport thereof, That the Parl. will ever have a care to prevent any danger which his Majeſty may juſtly apprehend to his perſon: with many other ſuch like expreſſions. Which, whether your preſent Actings and Councels do not directly oppoſe,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116999:3"/>
contradict, and give the lye unto, to your eternal infamy, and breach of publike faith, as much as in you lies, let the world and all men judge; as they will do in due ſeaſon. The rule in the Old Teſtament is, not to take any wicked Kings from their Thrones, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd behead them: but <hi>(Rom:</hi>

               </gap>3: 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.) Take away the wicked from before the King, and his Throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed in Righteouſneſse.</hi> And the rule in the new Teſtament. <hi>To be ſubject to Kings, and the higher powers, and to ſubmit vnto them, even for Conſcience and the Lords ſake: and to make prayers, ſupplications, and interceſſions for them, that under them we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſſe and honeſty: for this is good and acctptable in the ſight of God our Saviour:</hi> not to depoſe or ſhed their bloud, for which there is no precept. And is not this plain way of God, the ſafeſt for you and the Army to follow, yea the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhort cut to peace and ſettlement? Ruminate upon it, and then be wiſe, both ſor your ſoules good, and the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of poor <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Remember, that no proteſtant King or State, ever yet defiled their hands, or ſtained the purity and honour of their Reformed Religion, with the depoſition, or bloud of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Kings and Princes, much leſſe of a proteſtant <hi>king</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi> of a temperate and ſober life, as the <hi>King</hi> is; who never imbrued his own hand in any one mans bloud, in any tyrannical or bloudy way before or ſince the warres (for ought I can hear) but only in a Military.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Conſider, that the Scots delivered the <hi>King</hi> to our Commiſ. at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> upon this expreſſe condition, <hi>That no violence ſhould be offered to his perſon, &amp;c.</hi> according to the <hi>Covenant.</hi> How then can you un-king, depoſe him, or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life upon pretext of Juſtice, which if you do, you ingage both kingdoms to war againſt you, and to crown the Prince of <hi>VVales</hi> their <hi>King,</hi> as being next heir apparent.</p>

            <head>A Declaration touching the King.</head>
            <p>AFter mature deliberation upon the proceedings of the Lord General Fairfax, and the General councel of Officers, in relation to the eſtabliſhing of a firm and laſting peace within this bleeding, torne, and tottering kingdom, and the erecting of a pure and ſound Government according to the Law of Nature, and the fundamental laws of this Realm, and after ſeveral conferences and diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in order thereunto, divers of the Presbyterian party frequented to Weſtminſter, and other places, where they had ſeverall diſputations and conferences with the Officers, and other members of the Army; and after ſome debate upon the Foundation, of the grounds and principles of the <hi>Agreement of the People,</hi> the Presbyterians declared a great diſlike thereof, remonſtrating, That it was not founded upon a firm Rock; to which objections, ſeverall anſwers were made, for cleering ſuch ſcruples and cautions, as ſeemed dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to many; And as for the perſon of the King, they further declared, that notwithſtanding the preſent Ordnance of Attainder againſt his Maj. yet they conceived it requiſite and lawfull, that the prayers of the Miniſtery bee ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in every Congregation throughout his Maj. Realmes and Dominions; deſiring, that he may have a legal tryall, and that Hee may not be degraded of his Titles and Honours: Concerning which, be pleaſed to peruſe this enſuing Letter from <hi>Holland,</hi> touching the degrading of his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> We are here in a kind of amazement, to hear that your <hi>King</hi> ſhould be deſigned for the grave before his time: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, there's nothing more characterizes men wiſe in the opinion of the wiſeſt meer man, then that they ſee a far off, not the plague of the body only, though that, but judgments ſomtimes for evildoing, ſomtimes for acting indiſcreetly in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116999:4"/>
matters that may be done. That which may lawfully bee done, it may be abſurd to do at ſome time: The taking away life, which is that prized above all, by him that all account wiſe, is not juſt (ſay ſome) at any time, unleſſe there be a law that makes the thing done death, and death to him that doth it: The ſupream power of <hi>England</hi> that forbids any to judge of treaſon in a conſtructive way, but themſelvs have retaind in themſelvs a power to judge ſuch and ſuch practiſes and endeavours to amount to treaſon or death. In particular, ſupoſe there were law, or it were in the power of the Lords and Commons to take awoy the life of the preſent King, yet if <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhalbe made more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereby in reaſon, and the waas renewed, to the probable ruine of the Nations, and chiefly to thoſe who pretend moſt to piety and juſtice therein, it were better not. That it's dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous this may be ſaid: If you cut off, you muſt ſet up, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuities of that nature ſuddainly introduce confuſion: If you ſet up, it muſt either be a new <hi>King,</hi> or a new <hi>Government;</hi> if a new <hi>King,</hi> then the next of kinne, and if him, then let his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
