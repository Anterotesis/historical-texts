            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therefore to abate such vaine imaginations in our prayer <hi>with the true conceit of vnworthinesse,</hi> is rather to preuent, then commit a fault: and it sauoureth not of any basenesse or seruile feare; but rather of great trust in Gods mercie: for those things which wee for our vnworthinesse dare not aske, wee desire that God for the worthinesse of his Sonne would notwithstanding vouchsafe to grant.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This I say] Paul</hi> in the former verses hath laid downe two propositions; one, that testaments of men confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med may not bee broken: another, that the promises were made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, which is Christ. Now what of all this, may some say? Hee doth expound himselfe therefore, <hi>this I say;</hi> that is, the drift and intent of all my speech is to shew that the couenant or testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ratified by God can not bee frustrated. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, though it might so bee, yet that the Law could not abrogate the same: Which he proues by two reasons especially.</p>
               <p>First, from the circumstance of time: <hi>the law which began foure hundred and thirty yeeres after doth not disanull, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, from the nature of a testament, donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or legacie: <hi>for if inheritance come of the Law, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:25126:15"/>
                  <hi>not of promise; but God gaue it to Abraham by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Law which began afterward</hi>] The Iewes obiect and say, that God mistrusting his owne promises as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient to iustifie, further added a better thing; that is to say, the law, whereby men might be made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Our Apostle doth answere by demonstration. <hi>Abraham</hi> obtained not righteousnesse before God through the Law, because there was no Law when hee liued; and if no Law, then assuredly no merit. What then? Nothing else but the meere promise, which <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Galat. 3. 6.</note> beleeued, and it was imputed to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. <note n="h" place="margin">Luther in loc.</note> If a rich man not constrained therevnto, but of his owne good will, should adopt one to bee his sonne, whom hee knoweth not, and to whom hee doth owe nothing, and should appoint him heire of all his lands and goods; and then after certaine yeeres should lay vpon him a law to doe this or that; hee cannot now say that hee deserued this benefit through his owne workes, seeing hee receiued it of meere fauour many yeeres asore: so God could not respect our deserts go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before righteousnesse, for as much as the promise was made 430 yeeres afore the Law. Wherefore, saith <note n="i" place="margin">Vbi sup.</note> 
                  <hi>Luther,</hi> if thou wilt rightly diuide the word of truth, accustome thy selfe to separate the <hi>promises</hi> and the <hi>law</hi> so sarre asunder as heauen and earth, as the beginning of the world and the latter end; that when the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and accuseth thy conscience, thou maiest answere; <hi>Lady law, thou commest not in season, for thou commest too soone; tar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>yeeres; to which I assent, and sweetely repose my selfe in the same. Therfore I haue nothing to doe with thee, for I liue now with the beleeuing Abraham; or rather fince Christ his seede is reuealed and giuen vnto me, I</hi>

                  <hi>Augustine,</hi> and <note n="n" place="margin">Oecumen. Aquin. Ca. etan. in loc.</note> other, that <hi>Moses</hi> in that text speakes of the time that was from the beginning of <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, or birth of <hi>Isaac,</hi> to the beginning of the Law: but <hi>Paul</hi> in this text, of all the time that was betweene the giuing of the promise, and the giuing of the law. Now the promise was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> when hee was seuentie and fiue yeeres old, Gen. 12. 4. And <hi>Isaac</hi> was borne when <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was a hundred yeeres old, Gen. 21. 5. that is, 25 yeeres after the first promise. And from the birth of <hi>Isaac,</hi> vntill the children of Israel were deliuered out of Aegypt, at which time the Law was giuen (as <hi>Oecumenius, Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, Aretius</hi> exactly reckon according to Gods owne records) were 405. yeeres, in all 430. as <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 12. 40.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if the inheritance come of the law, it commeth not now of promise, but God gaue it, &amp;c.</hi>] This argument is plaine: for naturall reason, although it be neuer so blind, compelleth vs to confesse, that it is one thing to promise, and another thing to require; one thing to giue, and another thing to take. The <note n="o" place="margin">Luther.</note> law requireth and exacteth of vs our workes; on the contrarie, the promise doth offer vnto vs the spirituall and euerlasting benefits of God, <hi>offert &amp; adfert,</hi> and that freely for Christs sake. Therefore wee cannot obtaine inheritance by the law, <note n="p" place="margin">Galat. 3. 10</note> 
                  <hi>for as many as are of the workes of the law, are vnder the curse:</hi> but by the promise; for it saith, <note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 22. 18.</note>

If there were no punishment in this life, nor hell in the next for adultery, drunkennesse, murther, gluttony, yet they would abstaine from these works of the flesh out of meere loue to God and goodnesse. <hi>For they that are Christs, haue crucified the flesh.</hi> In this crucifying foure points are to be considered:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Attachment.</item>
                  <item>2. Arraignement.</item>

               </list>
               <p>First, wee must attach and bring our selues into Gods presence, saying with the <note n="t" place="margin">Luke 15. 18.</note> prodigall sonne, <hi>I will goe to my father.</hi> Secondly, wee must indite our selues of our sinnes at the barre of Gods iudgement: <hi>I haue sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst heauen, and before thee.</hi> Thirdly, wee must <note n="u" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31.</note> iudge our selues, that wee be not iudged of the Lod: <hi>I am no more worthy to be called thy sonne.</hi> Fourthly, we proceed to the lawfull execution of the flesh, vsing the meanes for the crucifying of it, and they be principally <note n="x" place="margin">Perkins.</note> three:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:25126:30"/>
The first is applying of Christ crucified, and that is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not onely that Christ was crucified for vs: but that we likewise were crucified with him.</p>
               <p>The second is to beat downe the flesh by the sword of the spirit, propounding in our daily repentance the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Commandements and threatnings of God against our seuerall affections and lusts. As it were slaying murther with commandement, <hi>Thou shalt not kill:</hi> and robbing the theefe with another arrow taken out of Gods quiuer, <hi>Thou shalt not steale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is to cut off the first beginnings of euill, and to flie the present occasions of euery sin. With these spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall nailes (as <note n="y" place="margin">In lot.</note> 
                  <hi>Luther</hi> speakes) a Christian may fasten all carnall desires vnto the Crosse; so that although the flesh be yet aliue, yet can it not performe that which it would doe, for as much as it is bound hand and foote, and made subiect to the spirit.</p>
               <q>Almighty and euerlasting God, giue vnto vs increase of faith, hope, and charity: and that wee may obtaine that which thou doest promise, make vs to loue that which thou doest command, through Iesus Christ our Lord.</q>

Cor. 12. that there are diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of gifts, but one spirit: to one is giuen by the spirit the word of Wisdome: to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit: to another is giuen faith by the same spirit: to another the gift of healing by the same spirit: to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretations of tongues: all these worketh one and the same spirit, diuiding to euery man as he will seuerally. Now the spirit which is the <note n="o" place="margin">Iohn 15. 26.</note> Comforter of the Church in her widdow-hood euer since Christs ascension, and as it were tutor to leade her into <note n="p" place="margin">Iohn 16. 13.</note> all truth, on Whitsunday de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended in visible shapes vpon the blessed Apostles assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, as the <note n="q" place="margin">Acts 2. 1.</note> Text speakes <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>One hope</hi>] As the Decalogue teacheth how to loue, and the Creede how to beleeue: so the <hi>Pater Noster</hi> how to pray. Shewing vs exactly what we must hope and desire: namely, first Gods glory, then our owne good. Gods glorie, for that is Alpha and Omega, the first thing wee must aske, <hi>Hallowed be thy name:</hi> and the last thing wee
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:25126:51"/>
must performe, <hi>for thine is the kingdome, the power, and the glorie.</hi> Now concerning our owne good: wee desire and hope for especially the kingdome of heauen, <hi>Thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come.</hi> On which all other petitions depend, for wee pray <hi>thy will be done,</hi> for this end onely, that wee may bee subiects in his kingdome of grace, and saints in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory. And his will is done by depending on his might and mercie for things temporall and spirituall; in regard of the one, wee pray, <hi>giue vs this day our daily bread;</hi> and for the other, <hi>for giue vs our trespasses, lead vs not into tentation, deliuer vs from euill.</hi> And by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence Gods kingdome is the center of all our wishes, and totall summe of all our hopes. And because the wise man euer begins at the end, our great Doctor hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned in things concerning our selues to begge the first of all, which is indeed the end of all. Seeing then all of vs walke in one way, all of vs haue one guide in the way, all of vs when wee come to our iourneyes end expect one and the same reward: it is very meete all of vs should endeuour to keepe the vnitie of the spirit in the bond of peace.</p>

But as he is a Mediatour and Lord of his redeemed ones, he hath neither fellow, nor deputy. No fellow, for then he should haue beene an imperfect Mediatour: no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, because no creature is capable of this office: the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof ariseth of the effects of two natures concurring in one action, namely the God head and the Man-hood. And therefore howsoeuer Preachers are his actiue instruments, his messengers, his Ministers, (if you will) his vnder Vshers to teach his schollers in this great Vniuersity: yet none can properly be called his Vicars, or Deputies to doe that in his stead which personally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him. In this sense there is but one Lord, and this one Lord is the Lord, euen the Lord of Lords, Christ Iesus God and man.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:25126:54"/>Answer is made, that to speake properly these are not faiths, but factions; all of them being either vnbeliefes, or misbeliefes. And therefore when the Disciples asked the Lord to <note place="margin">Luke 17. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>increase their faith,</hi> it must be construed of increase in measure, that we may grow from vertue to vertue, from knowledge to knowledge, from faith to saith, vntill we be full of growth in Christ Iesus: not of increase in number, for in regard of the manifold rents and diuisions in the Church, it is our dutie contrariwise to pray the Lord, that he will decrease, not increase our faith in number, which is and must be but one.</p>

must haue faith of his owne in his owne heart. Yet faith in regard of hir obiect is but one, for there is but one only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine truth, which is the general obiect of faith, and but one only Christ Iesus crucified, who is the speciall obiect of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying and sauing faith. One only faith, because one only Lord, hir owne only obiect. Albeit faith be diuers in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers men, and hath diuers degrees in one man: yet it is but of one kinde in all. And heere wee may learne how faith is said to iustifie, <hi>non vt mediator, sed vt medium;</hi> not as a meritorious or efficient cause, for that were to make our faith our Christ: but as an instrumentall or spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hand apprehending Christ who doth iustifie. For as our <note n="k" place="margin">2. part. hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of saluation.</note> Church aptly, faith is like <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> it points out Christ and saith vnto vs, Behold the Lambe of God that taketh away the sinnes of the world.

               <p>The Papists haue martyred the text in magnifying the wooden <hi>Crucifix;</hi> but a man by faith may behold Christ crucified almost in all the workes of God, either in vs or vpon vs. Doest thou read the Bible? there is a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> and as it were a speaking picture of Christ.

               <p>Concerning the Papists: I hold the Priests among them most inexcusable.

It is great pitie that many piercing wits of England can see nothing but thorow the spectacles of Statising Iesuits, and so hauing but two paire of eies, one of their Confessors which is <hi>nequam:</hi> and another of their owne, which is <hi>ne quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam:</hi>

Christ was faithfull also, for wheras it is the fashion of parasites and trencher-Chaplaines to flatter, or at the least, humour great men at their table: he did not deuoure the faults of the chiefe Pharisie with his fowles, and his sinne with his sauce, but correct him and his, <note n="s" place="margin">Ians<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The Pharisies had <note n="u" place="margin">Pontan.</note> two faults especially, misconstruing of the Scriptures, and pride. Christ here doth rectifie their error in both, in healing a sicke man on the Sabbath, he doth instruct them in the true meaning of the fourth Commandement according to the present occasion offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and in his parable to the guests, hee deliuereth an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent document concerning their ambition. Hee could haue cured this man, as he did many, with his bare word only; <note n="x" place="margin">Ardent. Iansen.</note> but to shew that all handy workes, as these of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and other of necessitie, as to pull a beast out of a ditch, are not vnlawfull on the Sabbath, he touched him, and by touching healed him.</p>
               <p>Two circumstances amplifie Christs exceeding rich mercies in acting this miracle: first, for that he did it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asked freely: secondly, for that hee did it with hazard of his credit stoutly. He did helpe the <note n="y" place="margin">Luke 7.</note> Centurions seruant, but vpon entreatie: the <note n="z" place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> womans daughter of Cana, but after a long and earnest sute: the blind <note n="a" place="margin">Mark. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Bartimeus,</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much crying, <hi>O sonne of Dauid haue mercie on mee:</hi> the <note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 17.</note> lunatike, but his father vpon bowed knees asked this boone, <hi>Master haue pitie on my sonne:</hi> whereas this man is cured instantly, without any request of his friends, or prayer of himselfe. Againe, Christ vndertooke this cure with hazard of his honour, wheras other miracles vsually wrought his glory. When hee raised from dead the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes sonne in Naim, all that were present praised God and said, <note n="c" place="margin">Luke 7. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>A great Prophet is risen vp among vs, and God hath visited his people:</hi> when hee cured two blind men, Matth. 9. <hi>They spread abroad his fame throughout all that land:</hi> when hee fed about fiue thousand with fiue barley loaues and two fishes, all that saw the miracle, said, <note n="d" place="margin">Iohn 6. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>This of a truth is the same Prophet that should come into the world:</hi> when he made the deafe to heare, and the dumbe to speake, such as were spectators euen with open mouth as it were cried, <note n="e" place="margin">Mark. 7. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>He hath done all things well;</hi> but in helping
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:25126:62"/>
this man after this manner on the Sabbath, he knew that the Pharisies on the contrarie would obiect that hee had done ill: and yet he first acted the miracle, then makes an apologie for it, answering their secret malice, <hi>which of you shall haue an oxe or an asse,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="f" place="margin">Heming.</note> Teaching vs hereby that we should not cease to proceed in well doing, though an infinite number of potent enemies on euery side combine themselues against vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Panigarol. part. 1. hom. in locum.</note> Some for the further amplifying of Christs abundant goodnesse, imagine that the sicke man heere was a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the Pharisies, and that hee came to this feast of his owne accord as a baite to catch Christ, and not with an intent to be cured of his Sauiour. <note n="h" place="margin">Maldonat.</note> Other hold this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, conceiuing that he made no suite but held his peace, rather out of <note n="i" place="margin">Cyril.</note> feare then out of loue to the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: he did happily beleeue in heart, but lest the Pharisies should excommunicate him, he durst not openly confesse with his mouth that Iesus is the Lord. As <note n="k" place="margin">Psalm. 39. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other case, <hi>I held my tongue, and spake nothing, I kept si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, yea euen from good words, but it was paine and griefe to me.</hi> Howsoeuer it was, heere we may behold the riches of our Sauiours exceeding great loue, curing the dropsie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans bodie <note n="l" place="margin">Beda. Gregor.</note> together with the Pharisies soule. <note n="m" place="margin">Heming.</note> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the diseased of the dropsie fell into it by disordered surfetting and drunkennesse. Hence then obserue, that Christ despiseth not those which haue cast themselues into sicknesse through their owne fault, if they follow this mans example: to wit, if they come where Christ is, and suffer themselues to be touched and healed of him, if they come to Church, heare the Word, fall to repentance, confessing their sinnes, and hartily crauing pardon for the same.</p>
               <p>The second chiefe part of this Gospell is the Pharisies malice, consisting of three degrees. It was in the Pharisie great iniustice to returne euill for good, but greater to doe this vnder the pretence of loue, yet greatest of all vnder colour of loue at a feast.

All these being put together, make drunkennesse a grandame in Babylon, and a very monopolie of mischiefe, transgressing euery precept of the whole Law.</p>
               <p>The first Commandement is, <hi>Thou shalt haue none other Gods but me.</hi> The meaning whereof Christ expounds it, Matth. 22. 37. is, <hi>thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soule, with all thy minde.</hi> Hee saith not (as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> notes vpon the place) <hi>feare the Lord:</hi> for the most impudent Atheists haue trembled, often in whom there is no perfect loue, <note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 18.</note> which expelleth feare. Neither saith hee, <hi>know the Lord:</hi> for heathen men haue some knowledge of God by nature: Psal. 19. 1. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens declare the glorie of God, and the firmament shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his handie worke. Neither saith hee, <hi>beleeue the Lord thy God:</hi> for the <note n="b" place="margin">Iames 2. 19.</note> diuels also beleeue; but hee saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely that which is the <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 13. 10.</note> fulfilling of the Law, <hi>loue the Lord thy God.</hi> As then our <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 6. 16.</note> Apostle said, <hi>he is our master to whom we submit our selues as seruants to obey:</hi> so that is our God assuredly which wee like best and loue most. And therefore for as much as the glutton and drunkard is <hi>totus venter</hi> (as <hi>Erasmus</hi> said of a Frier) all belly, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:25126:77"/>
all for the belly: without all doubt his belly is his <note n="e" place="margin">Philip. 3 19</note> God, and his glory his shame.</p>
               <p>The second Commandement is, <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen image, &amp;c. thou shalt not bow downe to them, and worship them.</hi> Albeit drunkards cannot endure to kneele one halfe quarter of an houre in the temple: yet they can bee content to kneele, and that on both knees, and those bare, pressing and answering healths in the tauernes either to their good Captaine, who many times is but a swaggerer; or else to their faire Mistrisse, who sometimes is little better then a strumpet; or else forsooth vnto their Soueraigne, vsing the diuels logicke, hee that will not be drunken for <hi>Caesar,</hi> is no friend to <hi>Caesar.</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Hieron. com. in Tit.</note> 
                  <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusationis occasio est, adiuratum per Caesarem frequentius non bibisse.</hi> This vngodly <note n="g" place="margin">Vide Ambros. lib. de Elia, c. 17</note> deuotion and idolatrous ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of he-saints and she-saints, as they protest vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly from the bottome of their heart vnto the bottome of the cup, is so full of scandall and scorne, that there can bee but a little difference between a drunkard in vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his wine-worship, and a Papist in obseruing his will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship.</p>
               <p>As for the third Commandement: a drunkard alway blasphemeth God in his workes, ofter in his words. It is an old prouerbe, Shew me a liar, and I will shew thee a theefe: so shew me a swaggerer, and I will instantly shew thee a swearer. For when once hee begins to seeme to himselfe <hi>valde disertus,</hi> a very fine man, <hi>faecundi calices cumiam fecêre disertum:</hi> hee will talke of God most, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee thinke of him least. It is recorded in the <note n="h" place="margin">Matth. 8. 31.</note> Gospels historie that the dispossessed diuels entreated Christ that hee would suffer them to goe into swine; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the chiefe place of the diuels residence is the soule of the swilling drunkard. <note n="i" place="margin">Matth. 12. 43</note>

               <p>Touching the sanctifying of the Sabbath enioyned in the fourth Commandement; an Alehouse in a Parish is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily the diuels chappell; while Gods congregation is chaunting in the Church, boone companions are chatting in the tauerne, hauing their letanie, gospels and epistles in derision of our common praiers, and the welsh sermon in scorne of our preaching: <note n="l" place="margin">Church hom. concerning the time and place of prayer.</note> so that they more dishonour God, and serue better the diuell on Sunday, then in all the daies of the weeke beside.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, if we consider our selues as schollers, our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable founders in great wisedome foreseeing the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold inconueniences of tipling in Students, ordained that we should haue but a spare diet in the Colledge, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad all excessiue riot and inordinate commessation in the towne. A Gentleman hearing that his sonne at Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie was giuen to dicing, answered, that want of money would occasion him happily to leaue that fault. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vnderstanding that hee was giuen to whoring, said, that either mariage or old age would one day cure that folly. But when he was informed of his <note n="g" place="margin">Morall vpon Ariost.

This dinner then is a feast of grace, that supper a feast of glorie. Secondly, because none can bee thrust out of the Church in heauen triumphant, many croud vnto Gods dinner in the militant without any wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment or bridelace: but at the last day when hee shall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>come to view his guests, hee will cast them out of the wedding chamber into vtter darknesse, as it is in the 13. verse. The Church vnder the crosse then is this kingdome, gathered together by the preaching of the Gospell, <note n="r" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9.</note>

The lay people resemble the firmament, called to receiue light in the publike preaching of the Word, and not to giue light, except it be candle-light in their owne priuate families. Indeed there be many blazing Starres and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Comets in this our heauen, but such are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly lights, but fiers: as the Philosopher, <hi>ignes fatui.</hi> The Preachers of the Word are starres in the firmament, first receiuing light from Christ, and then communicating it to other, as the words of their Patent import, Mat. 5. 14. <hi>Ye are the light of the world.</hi>

All which is implied in the 11. verse, containing a procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation <hi>ad arma, put on all the armour of God.</hi> And a reason, <hi>that ye may stand,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion foure points are remarkable:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Euery Christian is charged with <hi>armour.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. This armour must be <hi>Gods armour.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Panoplia,</hi> complet armour, <hi>all the armour of God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. This complet armour must not onely be shewed abroad, or hung vp at home: but vsed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed daily, <hi>put on.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The reason hereof is manifest and manifold: first, that we may be able to <note n="t" place="margin">For so long as a man standeth in battell he is well, if he fall downe then in ieopardie..</note> 
                  <hi>stand</hi> in battell. Secondly, that wee may so stand, as that we may <hi>withstand.</hi> Thirdly, that we may so withstand, as that we may foile our enemies <hi>assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> as well as retiring. Fourthly, that we may repell not only some few, but <hi>all assaults.</hi> Fiftly, all assaults not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the flesh and the world, but of the diuell also, which is the prince of darknesse, and generall commander of all forces against vs in these spirituall skirmishes. <note n="u" place="margin">Iudith 15. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Olofernes</hi> being slaine, his souldiers instantly fled. <note n="x" place="margin">Lombard. in loc.</note> If we conquer <hi>the rulers and gouernours of the darknesse of this world,</hi> wee shall easily discomfit their followers and instruments. If we cast the <note n="y" place="margin">Anselm.</note> rider, his horse will instantly be taken and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Euery Christian ought to put on the resolution of Captaine <note n="z" place="margin">Pareneticall treatise to the Princes of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, pag. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Ferras,</hi> alway bearing armes against the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Emperour of the world, wrestling not against blood and flesh onely, but against <hi>principalities, against powers, against spirituall craftinesse in heauenly things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first point: armour is necessarie, whether wee consider our owne weaknesse, or our enemies strength. Our weaknesse, as being vnapt and vnable by nature to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:25126:84"/>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5.</note> thinke so much as a good thought, and therefore we must be <hi>strong through the Lord,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Lombard.</note> who giueth his souldiers <hi>power and might,</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 144. 1.</note> teaching our hands to warre, and our fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to fight. It is reported of <note n="d" place="margin">Xiphlin in vita Traiani.</note> 
                  <hi>Traian</hi> that he would cut in peeces his owne garments, rather then his souldiers should want a ragge to binde vp their wounds: but our Captaine Christ hath giuen vnto such as march vnder his banner his owne flesh and his owne selfe, willing vs not to put on his armour, but also to <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 13. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>put on himselfe,</hi> that we may be <hi>strong through the power of his might,</hi> who can doe whatsoeuer he will, and will doe whatsoeuer is best for all his followers.

               <p>First, that <hi>Paul</hi> heere makes no mention of a backe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rete for the Christian souldier.

               </lg>
               <p>The second remarkable point of warre is, that we must aboue all other weapons of defence take <hi>the shield of faith.</hi> And the reason heereof is plaine, because the helmet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers only the head, the corselet the breast, and the sandall the foote: but a <note n="s" place="margin">Zanchius.</note> shield couers all the body. Let vs then <hi>aboue all,</hi> or as <note n="t" place="margin">Vulgar Latin.</note> other read <hi>in all,</hi> vse faith.

The sword of the Spirit without faith is no scripture to thee, the girdle of verity without faith is no truth vnto thee, all thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse without faith is vnrighteousnesse.

               <p>The third point of warre is, that the Christian souldier is armed with a sword so well as with a buckler: and this sword is <hi>the word of God,</hi> being <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> powerfull in operartion and sharper then any two edged sword. <note n="f" place="margin">Viues in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. lib. 14. de Ciuit. cap. 12.</note> Sharpe in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall,

                  <hi>put it on.</hi> For as it is not enough for the seruice of our Common-weale that wee keepe good weapons at home, or that we shew them at musters abroad, except we haue skill and will (as occasions of the State require) personally to serue with them: euen so, to haue the sword of the Spirit rust at home, or sometime to flo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:25126:86"/>
except he can and will vse Gods armour, and stand in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell against all assaults of the diuell. As in Physicke the best prescript can doe no good except it be taken: so the most complet armour is no defence when as it is not worne. We must in aduersitie put on patience, in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie put on humblenesse of minde, at all times <note n="r" place="margin">Coloss. 3. 14.</note> aboue all these put on loue, giuing euery man his owne.

               <p>
                  <hi>Iesus said vnto him</hi>] In this answer two points are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable: what he said, and to whom. <hi>I say not vntill se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen times, but seuenty times seuen times:</hi> that is, 490 times, and then (as <note n="e" place="margin">Apud Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum annot. in loc.</note> 
                  <hi>Origens</hi> interpretor is of opinion) a man is not bound to forgiue his brother any more. But most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors affirme that Christ heere names a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for an vncertaine, a definite for an <note n="f" place="margin">Euthym. Pontan.

                  <hi>the iust man falleth seuentimes a day;</hi> so that if wee liue but seuenty daies, our sinne will stand in need of pardon seuenty times seuen times. But if we continue long, and become the sons of many yeeres, assuredly we shall be the fathers of many sinnes, and neede forgiuenesse seuenty thousand times se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen times. O Lord <note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 19. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>who can tell how oft he offendeth?

                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:25126:93"/>The next point to be considered is the partie to whom our blessed Sauiour spake this, and that is <hi>Peter. Iesus said vnto him, I say to thee,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="m" place="margin">Petrus hic gerit personam ecclesiae. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selm. in loc.</note> To <hi>Peter</hi> as to a publike Preacher, and to <hi>Peter</hi> as to a priuate person.

Here then all Pastours are taught not to discomfort and despise the poore penitent soule: but rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Gods pardon and absolution as often as hee truly repents and vnfainedly beleeues his holy Gospell.

               <p>And this may be construed of the Churches absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so most expound it of mutuall forgiuenesse in priuate between brother &amp; brother. A lesson oft vrged by Christ as exceeding necessarie, whether we consider God, our neighbours, or our selues. In not forgiuing we wrong God, to whom <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 10. 30.</note> vengeance belongeth: our neighbours, in that our priuate <note n="x" place="margin">Philip. 2. 3.</note> quarrels often hinder the publike peace of the Church: our selues, hereby neglecting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther businesse of importance, yea the greatest of all our owne soules eternall estate, for <note n="y" place="margin">Matth. 6. 14.</note> except we forgiue other,

God will not forgiue vs, as Christ sheweth in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his ensuing parable.</p>
               <p>Yea but is it vnlawfull to defend our selues against the violent hands and virulent tongues of such as iniurie vs in our goods and good name?

We may therefore sue the slanderer euen for the Gospels glorie, lest good men be scandalized, and God himselfe blasphemed vpon any false report spread abroad of vs. Indeed the seditious <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> that scoffing <hi>Apostata</hi> say, that this and other like places of holy scripture disanull the Magistrates authoritie. For if wee must all alway forgiue, none may punish the faults of his brother. Here we must aptly distinguish between priuate reuenge, and publike iustice. A priuate person ought onely to admonish his brother, a publike magistrate being Gods Lieutenant, to whom vengeance belongs, may punish him also.

There was no great or extraordinary vertue in his garments after his death, when the souldiers had parted them among them: nor in his life when he wore them, for the people that thronged him, receiued no benefit by them, but onely she and they that touched him by faith.

Secondly, want of meanes to teach and instruct them, because the Papists among whom they liue, will not suffer the new Testament in the vulgar tongue. Thirdly, losse, which the Papists by their conuersion shall incurre, and (it should seeme by their toleration of Iudaisme) they had rather haue the crownes, then saue the soules of the Iewes, it was necessary that the sonne of man should suffer, as it is written of him, and yet <note n="k" place="margin">Matt. 26. 24.</note> woe be to that man by whom the sonne of man is betraied: it had beene good for that man if hee had neuer beene borne.
