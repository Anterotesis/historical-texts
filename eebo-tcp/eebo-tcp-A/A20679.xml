            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hauing already by the will of God, publiſhed a ſhort treatiſe of perſwaſion to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Recuſants, to reconcile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to our Church: I hold it my duty to ſpeake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to them alſo which fit in the chaire of <hi>Moſes;</hi> which would be accounted the great Maſters in Iſraël, guides of the blinde, lights to them which ſit in darkneſſe, inſtructers of them which lacke diſcretion, and teachers of them which are vnlearned. My purpoſe is not to ſpeake of all points concerning which there is controuerſie and difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them and vs, (for ſo ſhould I make a tedious vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume) but onely by inſtance in ſome few places for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſake, in liew of all the reſt, to aduertiſe them of ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours as dayly they commit in the whole courſe of their writings, when they handle the cauſe of religion, to the preiudice of the cauſe it ſelfe which they take in hand, and to the ſlander of learning. That I may vſe the words of the Apoſtle: This is not to caſt away the cloakes of ſhame, <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 2.</note> but ſtill to walke in craftineſſe, to handle the word of God deceiptfully, and not in the declaration of the truth; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo doing can they approue themſelues to their owne

conſciences in the ſight of God. They would beare the world in hand, that they are more exact in their iudgement, more painfull in their ſtudies, more acute in their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, more aduiſed in their anſwers, more diligent in all things they vndertake, then any other of the contrary reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; whereas, due examination being had, it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare they ſlubber vp many things negligently, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them looſely. They deſpiſe all our Schooles of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in reſpect of their owne Vniuerſities; as if ſolid lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and true Schoole-diuinity were no where taught but among themſelues, they hold all others to be ſuperficiall: and yet contrary to all Schoole-learning they ſuppreſſe the truth by fallacies throughout their bookes, they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the rules and lawes of diſputation, and in no place will they ſtand to the orders receiued in Schooles. Their yong frye of Seminaries and ſeed-men, which are trained vp vnder them, ſee not with their owne eyes, but receiue their ſophiſmes for true ſyllogiſmes, vpon the credit &amp; truſt which they repoſe in their teachers; as if it were impiety to call any thing into queſtion which their Readers haue taught them; or hereſie to examine their grounds by the rules of Art, which are the true touch-ſtone and onely try all of arguments. In their diſcourſes which they publiſh, they vſe ſuch prolixity, that the matter which is plaine and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious to any man of reaſonable capacity, ſeemeth perplexe, and very difficult: they deliuer the ſtate of the queſtion ſo vncertainly, that the reader looſeth himſelfe as in a laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, not conceauing what is the ſcope and drift of the Author, whether he hold the affirmatiue part or the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. In the end, hauing ſeemed to ſtand long in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt vs, they concurre with vs. They alledge no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguments in defence of the religion which they do maintaine, but ſuch as haue bene oftentimes anſwered by <hi>Caluin, Beza, Kemnitius,</hi> and other Proteſtant Writers: which arguments being already anſwered, are of no vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and therefore we expect they ſhould reply againſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15903:5"/>
the anſwers, and not produce the ſame things againe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will their diſciples take notice of any anſwer, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge theſe triuiall things for nouelties, and rare inuentions, as neuer heard of before.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things are but Satan transformed into an Angel of light, <hi>deceptio viſus</hi> to deceiue the world, as the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <note place="margin">The Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Bell and the Dragon.</note> Prieſts did the King <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> making him beleeue that <hi>Bell</hi> did eate and drinke, and was a liuing God; when he was but a dead Idoll. The King at the firſt, becauſe hee found the doore of the temple ſealed vp with his owne ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, the meate deuoured, and the wine drunke vp which hee ſet before the idoll, but ſaw not the priuy entrance which was vnder the table, cryed out with a lowd voyce: <hi>Great art thou ô Bell, and in thee is no deceipt.</hi> But when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> ſhewed him the footing of the Prieſts, and their wiues and children, in the aſhes which he ſtrewed on the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the priuy doore which they came in at; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed there was deceipt in the Prieſts of <hi>Bell,</hi> and he ſaw plainly, that <hi>Bell</hi> was no God but an idoll. So my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is to finde their falſhood by their footing, to ſhew how they enter in at the falſe doore, and go not the right way; to detect their ſleights and iuggling caſts, whereby they aduance errour and falſhood, but ſtand in oppoſition againſt the truth. Foraſmuch therefore as if the Goſpell be yet hidden, it is hidden to them which are loſt; the Lord of his mercy take away from their diſciples and followers, that veile or couering, which vntill this time hath continued vntaken away, and remoue from them the ſpirit of ſlumber, that hereafter ſeeing they may ſee. The Lord of his goodneſſe endue the teachers themſelues with his grace, that henceforth as ſincere Paſtors, and faithfull Stewards of his word, they may walke in ſimplicity, and handle his word plainly in the declaration of the truth, that they may approue themſelues to euery mans conſcience in the ſight of God: that when the chiefe Sheepheard and Archbiſhop of our ſoules ſhall appeare, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

Euery lawfull ſyllogiſme muſt conſiſt onely of three parts, or termes, as they call them; but here are fower, <hi>Petrus Petra, perſona Petri, &amp; ſtructura Eccleſiae: the perſon of him that made the confeſſion, his name, his confeſſion it ſelfe which is called the rocke, or foundation ſtone; and the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Church.</hi> His perſon, and his name, where it is ſaid: <hi>Tues Petrus, thou art Peter:</hi> the confeſſion or founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtone, <hi>vpon this rocke:</hi> the aedifice or building it ſelfe, <hi>will I build my Church.</hi> The <hi>medius terminus,</hi> or argument, whereby euery concluſion ought to be proued, muſt bee one and the ſelfe ſame as well in the <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition as in the <hi>Maior:</hi> but here it cannot be ſo, for it is <hi>Petra in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iori, &amp; Petrus in Minors, the rocke in the Maior, and Peter in the Minor,</hi> as if they ſhould conclude in this manner: <hi>The rocke is the foundation of the Church; but the Apoſtle which made this confeſſion, is</hi> Peter: <hi>therefore the Apoſtle which made this confeſſion is the foundation of the Church.</hi> But this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15903:6"/>
is not in <hi>Moode and Figure,</hi> the <hi>medius terminus</hi> being not the ſame in both propoſitions. Therefore if they will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it, and reduce it into a true forme, they muſt conclude in this manner: <hi>Whoſoeuer is the rocke, he is the foundation of the Church. But the Apoſtle which made this confeſſion (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Peter) is the rocke: therefore the Apoſtle which made this confeſſion, is the foundation of the Church.</hi> And then, beſides that they do confound the confeſſion and the confeſſor, S. <hi>Peters</hi> perſon and his doctrine, which are two ſeuerall and diſtinct things, the <hi>Minor</hi> is vntrue, and contrary to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of our Sauiour Chriſt. For he doth not ſay: <hi>Tues Petra, thou art the rocke;</hi> but <hi>tues Petrus, thou art</hi> Peter: nor <hi>ſuper hunc Petrum, ſed ſuper hanc Petram aedificabo Eccleſiam; vpon this</hi> Peter, <hi>but vpon this rocke will I build my Church.</hi>

So then, where he ſaith THOV, he ſpeaketh of his perſon; and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning PETER, he telleth what is his name; ſpeaking of the ROCKE, he iuſtifieth his religion, being three ſeuerall points beſides the aedifice and building of the Church, whereof that religion is the foundation ſtone.</p>

maketh for vs; I conclude that my Analyſis of the text, is without exception, let him refute it if he can.</p>
                  <p>Now this being the queſtion, whether the Church be founded vpon the perſon, or vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrine of Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> If they ſay, vpon his perſon: I reply: the Church was from the beginning of the world, and it ſtood as firme as now it doth, before the conuerſion of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> When S. <hi>Peter</hi> was not, the Church was one and the ſame which now it is, and it could not ſtand without a foundation. But the faith which he profeſſed, was more ancient then himſelfe, euen from the beginning common to the whole Church; ſo that the Church might well be builded vpon that faith, though not vpon Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> nor vpon the perſon of any ſinfull man. And therefore our Sauiour ſaith: he will build his Church, that is the members of the Church vnder the Goſpell, which make but <hi>vnam Eccleſiam aggregatam,</hi> one Church ioyntly with that which was vnder the time of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the time of the law, vpon the ſame foundation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſtones of the ſame building. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome Hom. 55. in Matth.</hi> Where he <note place="margin">De Rom. Pont. lib. 1. cap. 10.</note> ſaith: <hi>Tues Petrus, &amp; ſuper te aedificabo Eccleſiam meam, Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and vpon thee will I build my Church.</hi> And <hi>Hom. 4. in Eſaiae cap. 6. Quid autem Petrus ille baſis Eccleſiae? What ſhall we ſay of Peter the foundation of the Church?</hi> As if Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> did not acknowledge the doctrine, but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not the confeſſion, but the confeſſor himſelfe, to be the foundation of the Church. To the firſt place I anſwer: I haue examined, but finde no ſuch place in that Homily, but that which is contrary to it. But ſuppoſing that to be true, which he hath ſo faiſified, I anſwer to it, as likewiſe to the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d place which is rightly by him produced, that it is but the fallacy of aequiuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For he alledgeth that out of <hi>Chryſoſtome, as a speech proper,</hi> which is but metonymically vnderſtood. It is a figure called <hi>Metonomia cauſae.</hi> So <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi> ſpeaketh to the rich man: They haue <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 29.</note> Prophets; meaning not the men themſelues which were
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15903:8"/>
dead, but their bookes which were extant. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 20.</note> teacheth that we are built vpon the foundation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, that is: vpon the faith which is taught in the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall writings; ſo that there is but one faith, one ground or foundation, vpon which the old Church from the beginning, and the new Church vnder the Goſpell are builded vpon: theſe two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one, as before I haue deliuered. And that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> is metonimicall, and not proper, <note place="margin">Chryſſ. hons. 55. in Mat.</note> it appeareth by his owne expoſition of himſelfe, where he ſaith in the ſame Homily, contrary to that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath alledged: <hi>ſuper hanc Petram aedificabo Eccleſiam meam, id eſt, fidem &amp; confeſſionem, I will build my Church vpon this rocke, that is, vpon this faith and confeſſion which thou haſt made.</hi> And it is iuſtified to be a true expoſition by the conſent of other Fathers, as of Saint <hi>Hilary,</hi> which ſaith: <hi>ſuper hanc confeſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>

                     <hi>is already layed, which is Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> I will therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine the meaning of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> Saint <hi>Hillary,</hi> and Saint <hi>Cyril,</hi> in what ſort faith may be verified to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Church; and yet with a due reſeruation of that prerogatiue which belongeth to our Sauiour Chriſt,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15903:9"/>

As a gold ring of very ſmall weight, hauing a precious ſtone in it of great value, may be iuſtly eſtimated at an high price; not for the due value of the gold it ſelfe, but for the worth of the precious ſtone which is ſet in it, it may be ſaid to be worth an hundred pounds; ſo faith is ſaid to ſaue, though ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belong to Ieſus Chriſt; and to be the foundation of the Church, though Chriſt be properly that foundation, becauſe he is the obiect of our faith: and our Sauiour Chriſt and faith are ſo inſeparably ioyned together, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diuided one from the other, or conceiued one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other. Thus haue I briefly declared how the Church is not founded vpon S. <hi>Peter:</hi> But ſuppoſe it could be proued, how can it be deriued from him to the Pope? The office of Apoſtleſhip was perſonall, and died with S. <hi>Peters</hi> perſon. The Apoſtles were equall in authority. It was ſaid to them all: Go and preach, as well as to <hi>Peter.</hi>

                  <p>That I may come nearer to the man of Rome, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe this queſtion, whether there ought to be one head miniſteriall of the Church vniuerſall militant vpon the

No one ſecular Prince is ſufficient to gouerne a world, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if any one man could be ſuppoſed ſufficient, could it ſtand with iuſtice that one ſhould gouerne a world; becauſe no man can attaine to be ſuch a Monarke, but by oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and violent inchroching vpon the dominions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes. Againe, a Monarchy is the beſt ſtate of ciuill gouernment of one country; but the Eccleſiaſticall gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot ſimply be ſo, but onely when the Church ſo gouerned is in ſuch a country as is ſubiect to one ſecular Prince, and not in an Ariſtocraticall, or Democraticall ſtate: becauſe the Miniſters of the Church muſt be ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the ſupreme ſecular magiſtrates, and the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall gouernment of the Church muſt be ſubordinate and anſwerable to the ciuill gouernment of the country where that Church is. Againe, as one man cannot gouerne the ciuill ſtate of the world: ſo much leſſe can one man be head of the whole Church; all authority both ciuill and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall being deriued from our Sauiour Chriſt, which is both the head of the Church, and the Prince of the Kings <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 22. Apoc. 1. 5. Ma. 28. 18.</note> of the earth, and all power is giuen to him from God his Father both in heauen and earth. Our Sauiour Chriſt is conſidered two manner of wayes: as he is God, ſo is hee the King of the whole world by the right of his creation: as he is the Redeemer, ſo is he the Head of the vniuerſall Church by right of his redemption: as he is God, he hath his Vicegerents ouer the world, and they be his ſecular Magiſtrates. <hi>Ego dixi, vos dij eſtis, I haue ſaid ye are Gods.</hi> But <note place="margin">Pſal. 81. 6.</note>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:15903:10"/>
as hee is the head of the Church he hath no Copartener nor Vicegerent: no copartener, for ſo he were an vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mediator: no vicegerent among men, for no man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſupply his place in that behalfe, which I proue by this argument: The office and worke of his mediation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from his two natures, God and Man, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in one action of the ſame perſon; ſo that he which ſupplyeth his office, muſt be of an infinite power, which is not to be found in any man beſides himſelfe. Now leſt it ſhould be obiected that he hath ſaid of Miniſters alſo: <hi>Ego dixi, vos dij eſtis, I haue ſaid ye are Gods,</hi> as well as of Princes, <note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 34.</note> and therfore it ſhould be concluded that they are his vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents for the Church, as Princes for the common wealth: I anſwer, the argument doth not hold. For as both Princes &amp; Miniſters haue their authority deriued from him, ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a different manner; Princes as vicegerents: Miniſters onely as actiue inſtruments. For the keyes of the Church being in number but two: the one of the Word &amp; Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the other of Gouernment: In the opening and ſhutting with theſe keyes which is the execution it ſelfe, are to be conſidered two things, the actiue inſtrument, and the principall agent. The Miniſters are onely the actiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, to preach to the outward eares of men, when God alone giueth the gift of Faith, &amp; conuerteth the heart inwardly as the principall agent: they conferre the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward elements only in the miniſtration of the Sacraments: hee alone ſealeth remiſſion of ſinnes, and giueth inward graces: they lay hands vpon men to ordeine them Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which is the outward calling: he doth call them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and make them able by giuing them his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: they teſtifie and pronounce before the congregation <hi>in iure fori,</hi> that wicked men are excommunicated out of the Church; but God onely ratifieth it <hi>in iure poli,</hi> and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them off from being members of Chriſt, and ſhutteth the kingdome of heauen againſt them.

                  </argument>
                  <p>BEcauſe they write, that worſhipping images they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no idolatry, in that they diſtinguiſh betweene an <note place="margin">Bellar. de imaginib. lib. 2. c. 5. 1. Reg. 7.</note> image &amp; an idoll: that an image is the repreſentation of ſomthing that is in the nature of things, as in <hi>Salomons</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were the images of Lions, and Oxen: but an idoll is made onely to repreſent ſomewhat that neuer was, as the idols of <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> which are but falſe Gods of the Gentiles, Gods by imagination, and not indeed. And therefore they hold it for a ſlander to their religion, that their images are called Idols. Let the firſt queſtion therefore be concerning the truth of that diſtinction, that yee may examine their fiue reaſons whereby that diſtinction is by them auouched. Firſt, ſaith <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine, Images which are a true repreſentation of ſomewhat, are neuer called Idols in the holy Scriptures; as in</hi> Salomons <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: The images, but not the idols of Lions, and Oxen.</hi> To which I anſwer: firſt, it is but a kinde of <gap reason="foreign">

Secondly, this negatiue proofe drawne from Scriptures, is no ſufficient argument, but contrary to the lawes of diſputations, as is plainly ſet downe in the <hi>Topic</hi> called <hi>Pronunciatum, Authoritas non va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>

of the holy Scriptures, where the image of a Calfe is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an Idoll. For ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Stephen:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <note place="margin">Acts 7. 41.</note> 
                     <hi>and offered ſacrifice to an idoll.</hi> There in plaine termes the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, or true repreſentation of a calfe, is called an idoll. By this you ſee what ſmal credit is to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and what falſe grounds Catholike doctrine is buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon. Againe, Idols by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe are called <hi>ſtatuae,</hi> and are ſo tranſlated in the Latine, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 16. 17. and what is <hi>ſtatua</hi> but an image? Secondly, ſaith he: <hi>An idoll is in the Hebrue tongue.</hi> Leuit. 19. 26. Num. 23. Oſe. 6. <hi>a vaine thing, a falſe thing, a lye, alwaies ſignifying ſome falſe repreſentation, a falſe image, and not a true image; as Abacuc.</hi> 2. 18. Which reaſon becauſe it is but colewoorts twiſe ſodden, a mere <hi>tautologie,</hi> and all one with the former, I anſwer to it as before. Thirdly, he argueth out of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Cor. 8. 4. <hi>We know an idoll is nothing. It is ſomething</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in respect of the matter whereof it is made, as wood, ſtone, mettall; but nothing in reſpect of the forme, becauſe it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth that which is not.</hi> To which I anſwer as before, by deniall, in as much as the golden calfe, being for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gold, repreſented that which in forme was ſomewhat, a bodily ſubſtance, <hi>animal mugibile,</hi> a lowing beaſt. And that I may make a better expoſition of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words, out of S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, of that propoſition: <hi>Idolum nihil eſt, an idoll is nothing:</hi> as in matter it is ſomething, ſo in reſpect of any diuine vertue in it, which the idolater aſcribeth to it, it is nothing. And againe, by the analogie of that place, it is nothing either in reſpect of ſanctification or pollution of thoſe meats which are offered to it. And if there be any that cannot, or will not be ſatisfied with this anſwere, let them reply againſt it. Fourthly, ſaith he: S. <hi>Hierom vpon</hi> Abac. 2. &amp; Zach. 13. <hi>compareth hereſies and idole together, becauſe as an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol is a falſe image, ſo an hereſie is a falſe imagination.</hi> To which I anſwer: S. <hi>Hierom</hi> might as iuſtly haue compared hereſies with images, which are many times as vnlike the man for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15903:11"/>
whoſe pictures they are made, as hereſy is different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the truth. But he fayleth in the maine point of his compariſon, becauſe this propoſition is not generally true, that an idol is a falſe image, becauſe the calfe in <hi>Horeb,</hi> of which I firſt ſpake, was both an idoll and a true image. Fiftly, out of <hi>Euſtachius lib. 11. Odyſs:</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>an idoll is properly ſuch a repreſentation as the ſhadowes of men, flying phantaſies, and imaginations of the braine, which we thinke we ſee, when nothing is before our eyes, ghoſts, apparitions of ſuch as be dead.</hi> To which I anſwere out of the vulgar Latine Bible, which is of better authority with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then euer <hi>Euſtachius</hi> was: that the word image, is alſo vſed in the ſame manner, as: <hi>In imagine tranſit homo, Man paſſeth away as an</hi>

                  <p>This ſcruple being remoued, it remaineth in the ſecond place, that we diſcuſſe this queſtion: whether images are to be worſhipped or not? And herein the practiſe of the Romiſh Church is contrary to the doctrine they do teach, becauſe in their Churches they worſhip images, &amp; ſet them vp to be worſhipped; and inioyne the people to adore them; and yet not able to ſtand in the defence thereof, by their Writers they forſake their old defence, and by their Canons deny that any diuine worſhip is due vnto them. For the Councell of Trent hath theſe wordes: <hi>Imagines</hi>

repraeſentant: Images are to be honored (not to be adored:) and they are to be honoured onely with ſuch limitations, that we put no truſt or confidence in them; that we pray not vnto them; that we aſcribe not any diuine vertue to them, but onely they are to be honored for their ſakes whoſe images they are, and whoſe likeneſſe they repreſent to vs.</hi> There you ſee plainly what their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, how they deny them adoration. And yet by their practiſe, they do not onely proſtrate themſelues before them, as the Gentiles did before their idols, but plainly ſhew in action, that they ſuppoſe ſome diuine power to be in them, in that they pray to them, and by their long pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinations weary themſelues in viſiting ſome images ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then others; yea they trauell very farre to proſtrate themſelues before the images of our Sauiour Chriſt, and the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and other Saints in farre countries, when they haue in their owne Churches at home the images of the ſame Saints; yea farre more beautifull then are abroad. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith: <hi>Omnes cruces ador amus, we adore all images of the croſſe:</hi> And yet by his owne expoſition, this word <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">De imag. Sanct. lib. 2. cap. 12.</note>

And to make good this his expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he referreth vs to that decree of the Councel of Trent, which before I haue alledged. Moreouer he ſheweth, that as there is one adoration which is religious belonging to God; ſo there is an other onely officious, belonging to all Eccleſiaſticall rites and ceremonies; and ſuch things as are vſed in the Church. And to that purpoſe he alledgeth the authority of the 2. Councell of Nice, which ſpeaketh more in fauour of images then all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Councels, and decreeth in this ſort: <hi>Imagines ſunt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerandae, non quidem cultu latriae, ſed honore illo quo proſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi>

honoured, as the Church bookes, and the Church veſſels.</hi> (But I thinke no Catholicke, holdeth that the Bible, the Baſen, the Font, and the Chalice, are to be worſhipped by adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.) And ſo they call them <hi>ſacras imagines, ſacred images;</hi> as they call other things which belong to the Church, <hi>res ſacras, holy things;</hi> as the Communion cuppes, <hi>vaſa ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra, holy Chalices;</hi> the Font, <hi>lauacrum ſacrum;</hi> their Prieſts, <hi>perſonas ſacras;</hi> their Churches, <hi>Aedes ſacras;</hi> their Bibles, <hi>Biblia ſacra:</hi> and yet adore them not. And thus, as men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of themſelues, they qualifie the matter by ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties among the learned, to auoid ſuſpition of idolatry, &amp; continue the people in ignorance and groſſe idolatry. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, whereas <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and other Catholicke Doctors, haue before deliuered in groſſe tearmes, that images are to be worſhipped, <hi>cultu latriae, with diuine worſhip,</hi> or ſuch worſhip as is due vnto God. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to qualifie the matter, and to reduce them to the meaning of the Councell <note place="margin">De imag. li. 2. cap. 25.</note> of Trent, would ſeeme to make a more milde expoſition of theſe words, coigning this diſtinction: <hi>Inter ſanctos &amp; eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum imagines, &amp; reliquias, betweene the Saints themſelues, and their images and reliques.</hi> So <hi>inter Chriſtum &amp; eius imagines &amp; reliquias, betweene our Sauior Chriſt, &amp; his images &amp; reliques.</hi> And ſo he hath written that the images &amp; reliques are to be worſhipped with the ſame worſhip, as they whoſe images &amp; reliques they are; and ſo the images &amp; reliques of Saints with the worſhip of <hi>doulia,</hi> and of Chriſt with <hi>latria;</hi> But yet at the length, as a Cow that giueth a paile full of milke, and then kicketh it downe with her heele, he doth by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction ſo qualifie the matter, and ſet downe ſuch a ſtate of the queſtion, whereby all is ouerthrowne. For, ſaith he, that worſhip which is called <hi>latria,</hi> and that which is <hi>doulia,</hi> are of two ſorts, one is <hi>cultus verus, a true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> which is due to the perſons themſelues: the other but <hi>analogicus, an analogicall, or equiuocall worſhip onely, which is due to the images and reliques.</hi> But what difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>analogum,</hi> and <hi>analogatum,</hi> a liue Saint, and the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture

of a Saint, I referre the conſideration thereof to the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all Scholers which haue learned but <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> his <hi>Antipredicaments.</hi> As a painted man, or analogical man is no man, ſo analogical worſhip is no worſhip; a painted man is but the reſemblance of a man, ſo analogicall worſhip is but a reſemblance of worſhip, and not worſhip it ſelfe. But it is hard to deuiſe how they ſhould make ſuch a reſemblance of worſhip before the image, and not worſhip the image. And howſoeuer, if it were poſſible, yet the Apoſtle teacheth how they ought to auoid all ſhew of euill. And thus hath he auoyded that which was alledged againſt him by aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation, which is contrary to the law of Schooles.</p>
                  <p>To leaue their doctrine, &amp; come to their ſcandalous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, we charge them with breach of the ſecond comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, becauſe they fall downe before their images, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> in defence thereof, ſaith: They do not <hi>cultu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tribuere</hi>

If to proſtrate themſelues before the image, and ſay they worſhip not the image, but God in the image, might be lawful; then might both Iews &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles which did the like, haue excuſed their idolatry, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as neither of them hold their idols to be Gods when they fall downe before them. For knowing by the light of nature there was a God, but knowing him not as he ought to be knowne, nor in what ſort he ſhould be worſhipped, they framed idols, &amp; worſhipped him in thoſe idols; &amp; yet for ſo doing, they were condemned in the holy Scriptures, becauſe he being a Spirit, would be worſhipped in Spirit, but not in an idol; and ſo he will not be worſhipped in an image. Concerning the Iewes, which were idolaters, they knew their golden calfe was no God, but worſhipped God in the calfe. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> therefore asketh why they ſaid: <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciamus</hi>

&amp; Hi ſunt Dij qui eduxerunt te de terra Aegypti: theſe be the Gods which brought thee out of Aegypt?</hi> I anſwer, their maner was to call idols Gods; but <hi>Deos repraeſetatiuos, gods by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetation,</hi> becauſe they made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to repreſent God, vſing the figure called <hi>enallage numeri,</hi> Gods for God, the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for the ſingular. I anſwer him alſo by his owne diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they did meane <hi>Deos analogicos non veros, Gods analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically but not truly &amp; vniuocally vnderſtood.</hi> So in the ſtory of the Iudges, ſpeaking of <hi>Micha</hi> the idolater, the text ſaith: <hi>This man</hi> Micha <hi>had an houſe of Gods,</hi> the holy Ghoſt would <note place="margin">Iudg. 18. 5.</note> not call his idols Gods but in this ſenſe, becauſe they were idols. There it is plaine that in the Scriptures that which is knowne &amp; vnderſtood to be no God but an idol, yet is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a God. And that I may ſomwhat inlarge this point for the better ſatisfaction of the reader. The Iewes knew that God in particular which brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of Aegypt before <note place="margin">Exod. 19. 9. 11.</note> the golden calfe was made; for a little before he came down in their ſight vpon mount Sina, they heard him ſpeake with <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 19.</note> their own eares, he appeared in thundering &amp; lightning; his preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was ſo terrible they were afraid, they ſaid to <hi>Moſes: Talke thou with vs and we will heare thee, but let not him talke with vs leſt we dy;</hi> &amp; therfore could not think this calfe which they made afterward, to be the ſame God; which could not ſpeake, nor terrifie them at all, and conſequently they held it to be but an analogicall or repreſentatiue God.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15903:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that one God in heauen, as Iupiter or Apollo, ſhould haue many fellow Gods inferiour vpon earth, that is, many idols to beare their names.</hi> And I pray you what is this anſwer, but a confeſſion, or grant of that which I haue alledged, that the heathens accompted their Gods which they thought to be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to be Gods indeed, &amp; theſe vpon earth, before whom they proſtrated themſelues, to be but idols, and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of them which were in heauen? therefore they did not thinke they were Gods. Secondly, they framed dayly new idols, and yet ſaid not that they made new Gods. His anſwer is: <hi>Putarunt Gentes ſenouos Deos facere, ſaltem terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres: The Gentiles ſo doing, thought at the leaſt, they made ſuch Gods as were vpon earth, although not ſuch as were in heauen:</hi> which is no more then he ſpake before to the firſt obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a grant of that which I haue obiected. Thirdly, <hi>Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt ſimulacra pro arbitrio, nec tamen Deos mutarunt: They changed their idols at their pleaſure, whereas their Gods conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the ſame.</hi> To it he ſaith: <hi>Reſpondeo Ethnicos eâdem ſtultitiâ quâ putabunt Deos poſſe fieri manibus hominum, potuiſſe etiam credere Deos aliquos potuiſſe deſtrui manibus hominum: As the heathens in their fooliſhneſſe thought they could make Gods with their hands: ſo in as great folly they thought they could destroy the Gods which they had made.</hi> And this is no more then was in the anſwer to the firſt obiection, where he confeſſed that in the opinion of the heathen, their idols were but idols, and no true Gods. Fourthly, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> relateth, that when the Gentiles were accuſed of idolatry, they anſwered that: <hi>Non colebant idolum, ſed numen quod per idolum ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Auguſt. in Pſal. 113.</note> 
                     <hi>they did not worſhip the idoll, but the God which was repreſented by it.</hi> This obiection <hi>Bellarmine</hi> repeateth in his 2. booke and 11. chapter. But in the 13. chapter, where he taketh vpon him to anſwer the arguments go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, as I haue ſhewed, he paſſeth this ouer with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                  <p>But to to come the reaſons which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> produceth againſt vs for proofe of this defence. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they did
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:15903:15"/>
not beleeue theſe idols to be very gods, but repreſentations only of God, and ſo worſhipped not them, but God in them; why do the Prophets labour ſo much to perſwade them that they were no gods?</hi> I anſwer: whatſoeuer we proſtrate our ſelues before <note place="margin">Eſay 46. Pſa. 13. Act. 19.</note> in our prayers, conſequently we make it our god, not by our opinion, but by that adoration, which is the proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our ſelues before it; not directly, but by a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. And becauſe the people did ſo, the Prophets, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> in thoſe places by him cited, do not ſo much labour to proue them no Gods, as if the people had thought them to be ſo, but becauſe they proſtrated themſelues before them, and ſo by a conſequent made them gods. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine) if they did not thinke them to be gods, why did they inuocate, and call vpon them? why did they pray vnto them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they thought that they did heare them?</hi> I anſwer out of the Roman Catechiſme which holdeth this doctrine: that <hi>they muſt pray to the images of ſaints in the Romiſh Churches, not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Catechiſ. Rom. pars. 4. cap. 6 ſect. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>thinking that the images can heare them, but that the ſaints, which by thoſe images are repreſented, ſhould heare them when they pray before their images.</hi> The words are theſe. <hi>Quum ad imaginem ſancti alicuius quis dominicam orationem pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciet, ita tum ſentiat ſe ab illo petere vt ſecum oret, ſibi<expan>

When any man ſaith the Lords prayer before the image of any ſaint, let his meaning be thus, that he craueth of the ſaint himſelfe whoſe image it is, that the ſaint would pray with him, and obtaine for him thoſe petitions which in that forme of prayer are comprehended, and ſo that he would be for him inſteed of an interpreter, and a spokes man for him with God.</hi> So then, as the Catholike prayeth to the image of the ſaint, that the ſaint his ſelfe may heare him, and not the image: likewiſe, the Gentile prayeth to the idoll, not that the idoll, but God ſhould heare him. Other arguments he produceth, weaker then theſe, as namely: <hi>That the Gentiles thought their idols to be gods, becauſe they were ſo taught by their Prieſts; and the world did ſo beleeue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15903:15"/>
the idols did ſeeme to speake, when indeed, not they, but the diuels spake out of them, as alſo becauſe they had the ſhape of men, they thought they had in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> life &amp; motion.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: their Prieſts did not ſo teach them, neither did the world beleeue that they were gods, but analogically as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: For the Gentiles held that God was a ſpirit and not a body; the diuels ſpeaking out of them could not make the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles beleeue they ſpake, no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the friers ſpeaking out of the rood-loft maketh the Catholike thinke that the image in the rood-loft ſpeaketh. Again, the diuels ſpeaking out of them did imitate God, which ſpake out of the fiery <note place="margin">Exod. 2.</note> buſh, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it could not ſeeme probable that the buſh ſpake, but God out of it. Laſtly, that their idols had the ſhape of men, it maketh againſt him, for that ſhould be an induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rather to make them thinke they were no gods, but rather men.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, that I may not be tedious, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the erecting of images in the Church, whether it be lawfull or no?

And all theſe foure go before the conception of <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 13.</note> man, the other three follow after, not in Gods ſecret deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, but onely in his execution, two of them in this life, and the other in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>Vocation is an action of eſpeciall grace in this life, in which by the holy Ghoſt inwardly working, the Miniſter of the word outwardly preaching, and the will of man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly conſenting, man is effectually conuerted to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:15903:17"/>
faith, and piety of life.</p>
                  <p>Iuſtification is a ſentence of grace in this life, out of which they which are effectually called, are by him through Chriſt abſolued from ſin, and conſequently from the ſentence and decree of death.</p>
                  <p>Glorification is an action of glory in the life to come, by which corruption being caſt off, he doth cloath them with immortality after the ſimilitude of the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are ſubordinate one to the other, the firſt foure being before one another in order but not in time; becauſe they are eternall: the other three, though in Gods booke they be alſo eternall in reſpect of his determination, yet in reſpect of the men that are called, iuſtified, and glorified, as they are acts proceeding from his decrees to execute and accompliſh that in them which God hath decreed, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in order but alſo in time, they follow after, as they are not in eternity but in time. Theſe things being duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, let vs come to the ſtate of the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Our doctrine is, that God by eternall decree hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined ſome to ſaluation, others to damnation; the cauſe which moued him ſo to do, being not in them, but only in himſelfe, and that is onely his will and pleaſure. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects therefore of this diſputation are two ſorts of men, <hi>Paucitas ſaluendorum, the paucity, or ſmall remnant of them which are ſaued.</hi> And concerning them, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is all one with ours; that they are ſaued, no cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in themſelues, but onely in God, without any foreſight of any thing in them.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15903:18"/>
reprobation is directed, and the higheſt cauſe which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him thereunto, is onely his will. <hi>Non poteſt iniuſte agere cuius volunt as eſt iuſticiae regula: He cannot do iniuſtice which is tyed to no other rule of iuſtice, but his will.</hi> Whatſoeuer is the will of God, the ſame with him is iuſtice.

                  <p>Our aduerſaries which we are to conclude withall, are <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Becanus,</hi> two famous Ieſuites. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſeemeth in words ſomewhat to diſcent from vs by wilfull miſtaking both of vs and of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> from whom he would deriue the grounds of his diſputation, as a man that will not ſee that which plainly he ſeeth.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15903:19"/>
illum actum, nulla datur eius cauſa ex parte hominum. Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiuus eſt: Habet Deus voluntatem eos damnandi, &amp; huius cauſa eſt praeuiſio peccati; There are two acts of God in his repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, the firſt negatiue, the other affirmatiue. His negatiue act is this: He hath no will to ſaue them, and of that act there is no cauſe at all in men, but onely in himſelfe. The affirmatiue act is this: He hath a will to damne them, and the cauſe of this is the foreſight of ſinne.</hi> For proofe of the negatiue ſaith, <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: God hated Eſau, antequam aliquid mali agiſſet, non ſolum coram hominibus, ſed etiam in praeſcientià Dei, before he had done any euill, not onely in the ſight of men, but alſo in the fore-knowledge of God. He hated him (ſaith he) not for originall ſinne, for then ſhould he as well haue hated Iacob, becauſe origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne was common to them both; nor becauſe he was worthy of hatred, for ſo they were both, and ſo he ſhould haue hated all men, and elected none, becauſe all were worthy of hatred. By the way (ſaith he) it is to be noted, that theſe words: to hate, to harden, which in termes are affirmatiue, in ſenſe are negatiue, as odiſſe est nolle diligere, indurare nolle miſereri, to hate, is not to loue, to harden, is not to be willing to ſhew mercy. Againe (ſaith he) that a man is hardned, though it be a puniſhment for ſinnes paſt, yet it is an effect of this reprobation, ſo that God doth har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den him becauſe from eternity he appointed him to be a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Laſt of all (ſaith he) facere vaſain contumeliam, to make men veſſels of diſhonour; though being vnderſtood in this ſenſe: deputare ad contumeliam, to depute them to diſhonour and ſhame is affirmatiue; yet, being thus vnderſtood: Facere vaſa qualia requirit totius maſſae conditio, &amp; ſic relinquere, &amp; nihil aliud addere, to make them ſuch veſſels as the nature and condition of the whole lumpe requireth, and ſo to leaue them, and do no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act, is negatiue, and of all theſe there is no cauſe in men, but onely in God.</hi> But for proofe of the affirmatiue, which is: <hi>Habere voluntatem damnandi, to haue a will to damne them (ſaith he) that is by reaſon of the foreſight of ſinne, we haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, that I may ſpeake to euery point, I will firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate his words: <hi>Reprobation (ſaith he) hath two parts, one negatiue, that God will not ſaue, the cauſe of that is in God, the other affirmatiue, that God will condemne, the cauſe thereof is in man.</hi> Firſt, I ſay this is no lawfull diſtinction, to make a diuerſity of that which is an identity; for there is <hi>aequipollen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia in re,</hi> they be different onely in termes, but are equipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent one to the other in ſubſtance. He ſheweth out of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> that to hate, and to harden, which in termes are affirmatiue, are in matterall one with <hi>nolle diligere, nolle miſereri, not to loue, not to haue mercy,</hi> which are negatiue. But after the ſame manner I come vpon him, <hi>Deus vult damnare, God will condemne,</hi> is a propoſition in voyce affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue, and equiuolent to this: <hi>Deus non vult ſaluare, God will not ſaue,</hi> which is negatiue. And as there is no meane betweene loue and hatred, mercy and induration, but he that is not loued of God is hated, he that findeth no mercy is hardned: So, in Gods predeſtination there is no meane or third thing betweene ſaluation and damnation, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily by this decree, he that is not ſaued muſt be damned, he that is not ſeparated from the lumpe of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity muſt be left to continue in the lumpe of iniquity, no meane betweene ſeparation from it, and continuance in it.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, to leaue his idle termes to himſelfe, which ſauour of ſubtiltie, and not of ſubſtance, and which make that to ſeeme darke and obſcure, which is as cleere as the day light; I will ſhew plainely out of himſelfe that in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15903:20"/>
he conſenteth with vs: For, concerning this affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue act God will condemne <hi>Eſau,</hi> which he ſaith <hi>is an act of Gods reprobation,</hi> let him acquit himſelfe if he can. I would know whether he will haue it to be a part of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, as it is <hi>in ipſo decreto, in the decree it ſelfe,</hi> or <hi>in decreti executione, in the execution of the decree? in intention or in action?</hi> one of them it muſt be.</p>
                  <p>The decree it ſelfe which is Gods intention is eternall, the action which is the execution of his decree, is tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. If he meane it is to be referred to the decree it ſelfe, I proue by his owne argument, that then the cauſe why he would condemne <hi>Eſau,</hi> was not in <hi>Eſau,</hi> but only in God. For, he framed his argument to proue the negatiue part in this manner: <hi>That God would not ſaue</hi> Eſau, <hi>it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he foreſaw ſinne in him, for then he ſhould not haue ſaued</hi> Iacob; <hi>for he foreſaw ſinne in</hi> Iacob <hi>as well as in</hi> Eſau. So I come vpon him with his owne argument: <hi>That God would condemne</hi> Eſau, <hi>it was not becauſe he foreſaw ſinne in him; for then he would haue condemned</hi> Iacob, <hi>becauſe he did foreſee ſin in</hi> Iacob <hi>as well as in</hi> Eſau; Therefore, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> inferreth: <hi>the cauſe was onely in God that he would not ſaue</hi> Eſau. So I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, <hi>the cauſe was only in God that he would condemne</hi> Eſau. But if he meane that the affirmatiue part is to be referred to the condemnation which is the execution of reprobation, which is temporall, and not to the decree it ſelfe, which is eternall (as needs he muſt) and it appeareth plainely by his words following that ſo he meaneth, we hold with him, and his defence is all one with ours. For, how doth he proue the affirmatiue part: <hi>That God will condemne them, it is in themſelues?</hi> but by this ſentence of Scripture, Math. 25. <hi>Go ye curſed into eternall fire,</hi> the cauſe being ſhewed to be in themſelues: <hi>I was hungry, and ye fed me not.</hi> Theſe words are a finall ſentence to be pronounced at the end of the world, and not the decree it ſelfe, which was before the beginning of the world, theſe words put the decree in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and are a ſentence publiſhed to the world by the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15903:20"/>
mouth of our Sauiour Chriſt, whereas reprobation is a ſecret which God reſerueth to himſelfe in his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. And, whereas he calleth this finall ſentence of the Iudge reprobation, it cannot properly be ſo called, but onely by the figure called <hi>metonimia effectus pro cauſa, where the effect is vſed for the cauſe;</hi> for this is condemnation, and not reprobation, an effect of reprobation, but not repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>And, where for proofe of the affirmatiue part he ſayth out of Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Condemnare ſine culpâ oſt punire ſine</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Auguſt. l. 3: aduerſ. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian. cap. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>cauſâ quod iniuſtum eſt, To condemne without fault, is to puniſh without cauſe, and that is againſt iustice;</hi> I hold with him, God cannot in his iuſtice puniſh or condemne any man which hath not deſerued condemnation or puniſhment: but what is this to reprobation? <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> acknowledged ſo much long before <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his workes came forth, where he ſayd: <hi>Peccata ſunt cauſa cur condemnantur, non tamen cur</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Petrus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr locorum comclaſſis. 3. cap. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>à Deo reprobantur, Sinnes are the cauſe why men are damned, and yet no cauſe why men are reprobates.</hi> So where he ſaith that God doth make veſſels of diſhonour, the cauſe is in himſelfe; but that he doth <hi>deputare ad contumeliam, appoint them to wrath and diſhonour:</hi> It is in the men themſelues, we conſent with him, in as much as this deputation is an action which is temporall, but that making of veſſels of wrath is a decree which is eternall. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſaith: <hi>Peccata ſunt cauſa damnationis quae fit in tempore, ſed non reprobationis quae fuit ab aeterno, Sinne is the cauſe of damnation which is in time; but not of reprobation, which was before time, ſinne is an effect of reprobation, and therefore it cannot be a cauſe of reprobation.</hi> As the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his ſelfe do ſhew, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. De gratiâ &amp; lib. arb. l. 2. cap. 10.</note> that good workes are no cauſe, but an effect of election: ſo the argument followeth: ſinne is not a cauſe, but an effect of reprobation. The ſinne of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was hardneſſe of heart, he would not let the people go; this could not be the cauſe why God eternally did reiect him, but God reiected him eternally; and therefore in time he hardned his heart,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15903:21"/>
that he ſhould not let the people go.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, there are two ſorts of cauſes, one the higheſt, an other ſubordinate, which go betweene the decree, &amp; the execution thereof. So that albeit Gods will was the firſt and higheſt cauſe that he ordained ſome to damnation: which cauſe was onely in himſelfe; yet there are found o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſes inferiour and ſubordinate, ſufficient to ſtand with the rule of iuſtice, that his decree ſhould be put in execution, as hardneſſe of heart, infidelity, and other ſins, which cauſes are inherent in the men themſelues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Becanus</hi> writeth in this manner: <hi>The doctrine of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Euchirid. cap. 1.</note> (ſaith he) <hi>is vnderſtood two manner of wayes: either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Catholike defence, that God did, poſt praeuiſionem originalis peccati, quum vniuerſae eſſet maſſa perdita, aliquos ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere ex ſuâ miſericordia ad gloriam, alios in maſſâ perditionis relinquere vt eſſent vaſa in contumeliam, After he foreſaw ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne in the whole lumpe being corrupted, of his mercy chooſe ſome to be veſſels of honour, and leaue others in the lumpe of perdition to be veſſels of diſhonour: Or according to</hi> Caluin, <hi>that God before he fore ſaw originall ſinne, Ex maſſâ integrâ, Out of the lumpe being ſound, ordained ſome to life, others to death without any offence of theirs or their parents.</hi> And as it is taken in that ſecond ſenſe he argueth againſt <hi>Caluin,</hi> and out of this diuiſion ſo made by himſelfe, he frameth his diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>By the way, before we come to his arguments. Firſt, it is ſuperfluous and idle, to ſuppoſe that God did predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>antè aut poſt praeuiſionem peccati, before or after the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of originall ſinne,</hi> becauſe he did both <hi>praeuidere &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinare ab aeterno, foreſee and predeſtinate from euerlaſting,</hi> with him there is <hi>nihil prius aut poſterius, nothing before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> becauſe he is before all time. Againe, this were to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ignorance vnto God, as if ſome thing had bene to come to paſſe which once he did not foreſee. Thirdly, our queſtion is not of the time when? but of the cauſe why God did predeſtinate? I confeſſe with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> theſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15903:21"/>
termes: <hi>Poſt praeuiſionem operum &amp; expraeuiſis operibus, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

                     <hi>the foreſight of workes, and out of a foreſight of workes</hi> (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this foreſight to be the cauſe) are all one, ſo that he diſputeth not of the time when? but of the cauſe why God did predeſtinate? But, with this Ieſuite it is otherwiſe, as it appeareth by the ſequele of his diſputation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he commeth not neere the queſtion which he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. As alſo, <hi>maſſaintegra &amp; corrupta, the ſtate of innocency and of ſinne,</hi> though in time they ſucceeded one another; yet in Gods foreſight they were both at once. But let vs come to his argument.</p>
                  <p>That God did not predeſtinate any man to life <hi>ex maſſâ integrâ, out of the lumpe being ſound,</hi> before he foreſaw ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne in him, he taketh vpon him to confirme by two reaſons, the firſt is this: <hi>If God did ſo, then the decree of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination was before the decree of Chriſt his incarnation, but that decree of predeſtination was not before the decree of Chriſts incarnation; Therefore God did not predeſtinate man to life out of the lumpe being ſound, before he foreſaw originall ſinne in him.</hi> He proueth the ſequele of the Maior; <hi>becauſe the foreſight of ſinne is more ancient then the decree of incarnation: for had not</hi> Adam <hi>ſinned, Chriſt had neuer bene incarnate.</hi> He proueth the Minor, becauſe <hi>elſe our election had not bene grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the merits of our Sauiour Chriſt.</hi> For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legit nos in Chriſto, he hath choſen vs in Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> To which <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> I anſwere: This is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a skirmiſh with his owne ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but no combat with <hi>Caluin,</hi> becauſe he obtrudeth that to <hi>Caluin</hi> which is not his doctrine. <hi>Caluin</hi> doth not hold that God did predeſtinate any man to life <hi>ex maſſâ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrâ, out of the lumpe being ſound:</hi> for the lumpe being ſound, men were in ſtate of life <hi>iure creationis, by the right of their firſt creation,</hi> and if the lumpe had continued ſound, there had bene no vſe of predeſtination; for that is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon Chriſt his merits, which were to take place <hi>maſſâ perditâ, &amp; corruptâ, the lumpe being corrupted.</hi> And much leſſe did <hi>Caluin</hi> hold that God did predeſtinate or ordeine
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:15903:22"/>
to death, <hi>ex maſſâ integrâ, out of the lumpe being ſound.</hi> For, beſides that it was impoſſible that man ſhould dye, the whole lump <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2+ words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊…〉</desc>
                     </gap>uing in the firſt integrity, it could not ſtand with Gods iuſtice. But <hi>Caluins</hi> doctrine is, that God did <hi>ab aeterno ante <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ words">
                           <desc>〈◊…〉</desc>
                        </gap> creatam, multò magis antè maſſam integram aut corruptam, eternally before the lumpe was created, and therfore before the integrity or corruption of it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate out of it by his decree, ſome to life, ſome to death, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that it ſhould be corrupted.</hi> For in his predeſtination, he had a generall reſpect to the whole lumpe, which hee foreſaw ſhould be corrupted, though not to the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of euery particular veſſell which was to be framed out of that lumpe: ſo his predeſtination which was decreed from eternity was executed in time, after the lumpe had receiued corruption; for ſo long as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued ſound, there could be no vſe of predeſtination, nor poſſibility of death. And ſo, euen as they which are ſaued, are the children of God before they are borne, by eternall predeſtination, but not by actuall adoption vntill they be ſanctified; likewiſe they which are damned, be eternally by reprobation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are born, but not actually before they be infected with ſin, the children of Belial, and veſſels of deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, how could there be <hi>praeuiſio peccati in maſſâ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrâ, aforeſight of ſinne in the lumpe being ſound?</hi> when <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritas maſſae &amp; originale peccatum, the ſoundneſſe of the lumpe and originall ſinne cannot ſtand together?</hi> God did foreſoe that the ſound lumpe ſhould be infected, but not ſo long as it continued in integrity. The lumpe ſo long as it was found, conſiſted but of two perſons, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> both which are ſaued, by all mens confeſſion: how then did God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate any to damnation out of the lumpe being in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity? I confeſſe that in reſpect of the corruption of the whole lumpe which God did foreſee, there was firſt afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of ſinne, then a decree that Chriſt ſhould be incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and then the decree of predeſtination founded vpon the merits of Ieſus Chriſt, which were in order, &amp; as we do
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15903:22"/>
apprehend them, one before the other; yet in eternity, with God they were altogether, but in reſpect of <hi>maſſa integra, the lumpe being ſound,</hi> there were none of theſe; ſo that this ſyllogiſme confuteth not <hi>Caluin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His ſecond argument is this: <hi>Infants</hi> (ſath he) <hi>dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out baptiſme, according to</hi> Caluins <hi>doctrine, are ſaued by the faith of their parents; therefore God hauing a respect to their faith predeſtinated them, non ſine intuitu operum, not without a foreſight and relation to ſomewhat which was in the perſons of thoſe men.</hi> To which I anſwer: That in the ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency Baptiſme was not inſtituted, neither was Faith prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and therefore he diſputeteth idlely. Againe if he had brought this argument to proue predeſtination after the lumpe was corrupted, to proceed from any thing that God reſpected in man: It were but a Fallacie, <hi>non cauſa pro cauſà.</hi> For faith which God foreſaw in any man, is not the cauſe why hee did predeſtinate him to ſaluation, but contrarily his predeſtination is the cauſe why man is comprehended vnder the couenant of Grace, and why hee giueth him faith that hee may bee ſaued. For whomſoeuer he vouchſafeth the end, them alſo he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth the meanes whereby they may attaine to that end. Gods predeſtination conſiſteth with good workes as it doth with faith, though he predeſtinateth freely without the merit of good workes, the workes being an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and end of Gods election, and not the cauſe that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">Eph. 1.</note> him to elect vs: for the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>He choſe vs that we might be holy, and not becauſe we were holy, or becauſe he did foreſee that we ſhould be holy.</hi> And his election is made ſure to vs by good works, which are the effects and fruits thereof. <note place="margin">2.

                     <hi>Yea God was mercifull euen to the reprobates, becauſe he gaue his Sonne to be the Redeemer of mankinde.</hi> And there digreſſing from his argument, he exclaimeth againſt <hi>Caluin,</hi> as if <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>that God did execute cruelty vpon mankinde, elect but a few, and damne a great multitude, condemne man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his cauſe is heard, ſtirre man vp to commit ſinne, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he might take occaſion to puniſh him.</hi> My anſwer is as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Firſt, that he did not foreſee any originall ſinne that could be in man ſo long as man was to continue in the ſtate of innocency; and therefore he doth but beate the aire as before, to proue that againſt <hi>Caluin,</hi> which <hi>Caluin</hi> neuer meant, that God ſhould predeſtinate any man to death the lumpe being pure: for reprobation and the ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency could not ſtand together. As he created man to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſſe, ſo he decreed not that man ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in that happineſſe. As his decree of death was but conditionall, if man were diſobedient: ſo he gaue not man conſtancy to perſeuer in obedience. As all the wayes of the Lord are mercy, ſo his mercy belongeth onely to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but he gaue not to all the gift of faith. As he was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull euen to the reprobates, in that he gaue his Sonne to be a redeemer of the whole world; ſo this benefite did not extend any way to the reprobates, but onely to the elect. Hee gaue him to bee a ſufficient Redeemer of the whole world, if the whole world would haue receiued him, but he was an effectuall redeemer onely to the beleeuers. He offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his grace through Chriſt to all men, euen to the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, but he ſealed and confirmed it onely to the elect. So theſe arguments refute not <hi>Caluin.</hi> And that I may anſwer his exclamations. This cannot be cruelty in God, but as the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>It is iuſtice. Nunquid deo non licebit quod figulo licet? May not God do as much as the Potter may do?</hi> Neither <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 21.</note>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Church of Rome hath bene, for many yeares paſt, charged with the crime of idolatry, for yeelding that worſhip to dead mens ſoules which is due onely to God. Being not able to ſtand any longer vpon the iuſtification of themſelues, the matter appearing ſo fowle, they flye fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their firſt holds, and deuiſe new defences to auoide that grieuous imputation; and yet ſtill to retaine their ancient ſuperſtition.

à Deo nobis beneficia concedantur: It is not lawfull to pray vnto Saints as authors and giuers of any good thing which they ſhould beſtow vpon vs, but onely as helpers and mediators vnto God in our behalfe, that by their praiers for vs, we may more eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine at the hands of God ſuch things as we ſhall aske.</hi> Being charged that their practiſe is contrary to this doctrine, that in the practiſe of their religion throughout their Churches they pray ſtill in as groſſe maner, as before they did, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer in their Schoole-diuinity they dare not maintaine it, to cleare themſelues they ſay: <hi>Si quis dicat ſancte</hi> Petre <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerere</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Bellar. Ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</note> 
                     <hi>mei, quantum ad verba ſic licet dicere, ſed ſenſus intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendus eſt: Miſerere mei orando pro me, da mihi aditum coeli, id eſt precibus impetra: It is lawfull to pray in theſe termes:</hi> S. Peter <hi>haue mercy vpon me, open to me the gate of heauen: but that praier is not to be vnderſtood as it is conceiued in thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words, but in another ſenſe, which is this: Pray for me that I may obtaine mercy, by thy praiers obtaine for me that the gate of heauen may be opened vnto me,</hi> To which I reply, that the common people among them are no Schoole-men, and therefore this euaſion doth not make their prayer to bee leſſe idolatrous then it was before. This is but to hold the people ſtill in darkneſſe, and to rob God of his honour by the fallacy of equiuocation. But let vs examine the grounds of this defence: They alledge the words of the Apoſtle: <hi>I magnifie my office to try if by any meanes I might</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Bell ibidem. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>prouoke them of my fleſh to follow them, and might ſaue ſome of them.</hi> And in another place: <hi>I am made all things to all men, that I might by all meanes ſaue ſome.</hi> To theſe words I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 22.</note> they are ſufficient to proue that while Saint <hi>Peter</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, God ſtirred him vp as an inſtrument of his glory to bring men to the kingdome of heauen, and to ſaue their ſoules, but not after he was departed out of this life. So <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 16.</note> Timothy <hi>taking heed to learning, and continuing therin, might both ſaue himſelfe, and them which heard him,</hi> when he liued, but not after his death. For who knoweth not, that <hi>verbum Dei eſt officio ſeruatrix humani generis? the word of God hath a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:15903:25"/>
ſauing power,</hi> and that the miniſtery of the Goſpell is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meane to ſaue mens ſoules? But what is this to Saints departed, whoſe miniſtery ceaſeth, or to proue the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of prayer to the dead which do not heare vs? <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpake of ſauing men in his life time, not after his death, by his preaching to them, not by their praying to him that he ſhould pray for them. This is no true kinde of argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a fallacy called <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The defence of the Romiſh Church being this: that Saints are to be inuocated after they be dead, not as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but as mediators; let this be the queſtion betweene vs: whether any ſuch inuocation is commended vnto vs in the holy Scriptures, or no? <hi>Eckius,</hi> one of their greateſt <note place="margin">Euchirid. com. locorum cap. 15.</note> Schoole-diuines that euer was in the Vniuerſitie of Ingol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtad, maketh this free confeſſion, that <hi>innocation of Saints is not expreſsly commanded in holy Writ: Explicitè ſanctorum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocatio non eſt praecepta in ſacris literis: Not in the old teſtament</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe the people of themſelues were prone to idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the Saints departed were then in Limbus, and not in heauen. In the new testament the Apoſtles wrote no ſuch thing, left ſuch doctrine ſhould be a meanes to bring the Gentiles backe againe to idolatry as alſo becauſe the Apoſtles their ſelues would not be thought ſo ambitious as to ſeeke their owne glory after their death.</hi> I deſire them therefore with Chriſtian ſobriety to ſpeake to theſe foure points.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the wiſedome of the holy Ghoſt being ſuch, that in the whole body of the Bible, ſuch inuocation was not ſo much as once named for feare of idolatry, how can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied but this inuocation hath at the leaſt ſome affinity with idolatry? or why ſhould the Church of Rome either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, or go beyond the wiſedome of God, to maintaine &amp; publiſh that in their humane policy, which God in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wiſdome thought fit to be ſuppreſſed and concealed? or why ſhould not the perill of idolatry bee as carefully ſhunned now as then it was?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, foraſmuch as the confeſſion of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15903:25"/>
                     <hi>Dico illa omnia ſcripta eſſe ab Apoſtolis quae ſunt omnibus neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaria,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">De verbo Dei lib. 4. cap. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; quae ipſipalam omnibus vulgo praedicaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that all things which are neceſſary for the Church to know, or which the Apoſtles in their Sermons by word of mouth did publiſh &amp; teach are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Apoſtles,</hi> but this inuocation is not mentioned in their writings; and therefore was neither taught by them nor held neceſſary to ſaluation. Why doth the Church of Rome ſo vehemently maintaine it? S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>preſume to vnderſtand aboue that which is meet to be vnderſtood, but that euery man muſt, ſapere adſobrietatem, vnderſtand with ſobriety.</hi> And what it is <hi>plus ſapere quàm oportet, to vnderſtand aboue that which is meet, and not according to ſobriety,</hi> he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in another place: <hi>ſupra id quod ſcriptum eſt ſapere, when</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>any man ſhall preſume beyond that which is written.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if inuocation of Saints were neceſſary for the eaſier obtaining of mercy at the hands of God, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier way to ſaue mens ſoules; and yet the Apoſtles for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to publiſh this doctrine, becauſe they would not be thought ambitious, they were not faithfull Stewards of the word, nor ſo carefull of the Church of Chriſt as behoued men of that holy vocation for humane reſpects negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting their office. Furthermore, they did contrary to the rule of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in concealing the truth of religion, <hi>which was to do euil, that good might follow,</hi> which imputation <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 8.</note> cannot without great impiety bee layed vpon ſuch ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied veſſels. Nay which is more, how can it ſtand with that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth of himſelfe, where he ſaith: <hi>I haue kept nothing backe, but haue ſhewed you all the councell of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 20. 27. &amp; 35.</note> 
                     <hi>God.</hi> And againe, <hi>I haue ſhewed you all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in the ſame chapter <hi>Eckius</hi> hauing deliuered that ſuch inuocation is no where expreſſed in the holy Scriptures; yet taketh vpon him to produce many expreſſe places to proue the ſame; I would therefore bee ſatisfied with what conſcience he could aledge thoſe places to reſiſt a knowne truth?</p>
                  <p>But to come to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> when <hi>Mathias</hi> was to be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15903:26"/>
in the place of <hi>Iudas,</hi> the Apoſtles prayed after this manner: <hi>Thou Lord, which knoweſt the hearts of all men,</hi>

Cognoſcunt quidem preces noſtras, non vt ſunt in mentibus noſtris, ſed vt ſunt in Deo quem vident, &amp; qui eas ipſis oſtendit. The Catholickes aſcribe not to Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted any Deity, as if they had power in themſelues to bee diſcerners of mens thoughts. And yet they conceiue our prayers, though not by any inſight into vs, or inspection into the inward and hidden man, but by viſion in the Maieſtie of God, whom they do ſee, and who reuealeth our prayers vnto them.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this anſwer I diſpute in this manner out of his owne booke in another place: If Saints conceiue our prayers in ſuch ſort, as is aforeſaid, then it is by a generall illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination <note place="margin">De ſanct. beat. lib. 1. cap. 20.</note> or viſion, by which at their firſt entrance into the ſtate of happineſſe, in the Maieſty of God, they ſee all at once, or elſe ſucceſſiuely by a ſpeciall reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, at ſuch times and ſeaſons onely as pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in particular are made vnto them, he ſtandeth in doubt what he ſhould anſwer, whether it be by ſuch a generall il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, or ſuch eſpeciall reuelation? by which of them it is, or whether it be by any of them, or not, he cannot tell.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15903:26"/>
For he ſaith: <hi>Ex his duabus prior videtur ſimpliciter probabilior tamen poſterior ſententia eſt magis idonea ad conuincendos here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticos: It is more probable it ſhould be by viſion, and yet it is a more ſafe defence againſt the heretickes, to hold that it is by reuelation:</hi> In which words you ſee what weake grounds he buildeth vpon, which are onely, <hi>probabilitas, &amp; ſtudium contradice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di, the firſt probility, or humane coniecture: the ſecond, a vaine deſire of contradiction, to withſtand his aduerſaries in diſputation;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by truth or falſhood, right or wrong, by certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or vncertainty, by hap or good cunning, he careth not. I reply therefore: If Saints heare vs not, it is very idle to pray vnto them, if it were poſſible that they could heare vs: but if we cannot reſolue our ſelues that they do heare vs, our praiers can neither be effectuall, nor yet made with a good conſcience. That they cannot be effectuall, it is the doctrine of Saint <hi>Iames: Euery thing which</hi>

text.

Secondly, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Church of Rome they were then in Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, as all other Saints departed, vntill the death of our Sauiour Chriſt; therefore they could make no interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

                  <p>IT pleaſed God I publiſhed a ſhort Treatiſe of perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ignorant Recuſants, to reconcile themſelues to our Church. I might happily haue perſwaded them, at the leaſt, to be halfe Conuerts, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did King <hi>Agrippa</hi>

The points which eſpecially I vrged, were proued out of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> their owne Doctor, and in the places by me produced, I falfified nothing; but dealt ſincerely, let the learned diſproue me, if they can.

that they muſt either anſwere me with ſilence, or elſe, if they deale ingeniouſly, ſay with the inchanters: <hi>Digitus</hi>

An author without a name, printed a booke at <hi>Paris, Anno</hi> 1607. with this Title: <hi>The firſt part of Proteſtant proofes for Catholicke Religion and Recuſancy, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken onely from the writings of ſuch Proteſtant Doctors as haue bene publiſhed ſince the reigne of his Maieſty.</hi> Which booke is nothing elſe but an vndigeſted Chaos, or Miſcellanea of halfe ſentences rudely conſarcinated together, a confuſed heape of places, ſome meerely diuiſed by himſelfe, and not to be found in theſe Proteſtant Doctors; ſome wreſted and falſly applied; ſome truly alledged; but imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the argument hee taketh in hand: all of them being praemiſſes without concluſions, to make an idle ſhew of proofe where nothing is proued; and of a confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where nothing is confuted. Theſe proofes he ſaith, he collected out of the bookes of the reuerend Father in God, the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Doctor <hi>Suckliffe,</hi> Doctor <hi>Field,</hi> Doctor <hi>Downam,</hi> Doctor <hi>Morton,,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Egerton,</hi> and my ſelfe, among many others, in defence of his Recuſancy, and Romiſh religion. But hee hath not vndertaken to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer any of our books; neither can any iudicious man hold ſuch recital of our words, to be a confutation of our works.

with <hi>Elimas</hi> peruerted the ſtraight waies of the Lord, and <note place="margin">Acts 13. 10.</note> withſtood the truth by indirect and ſiniſter meanes, as <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> reſiſted <hi>Moſes;</hi> For I preſſed them by way <note place="margin">Exod. 7. 11. 13.</note> of ſound reaſon, and ſtrong argument, he hath dealt by Elenches and Sophiſmes, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, he hath theſe words. <hi>The greateſt number of Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant writers, Doctor</hi> Succliffe, <hi>Doctor</hi> Doue, <hi>&amp;c. do teach there is no matter of faith, no materiall or ſubstantiall point or difference in religion betweene Proteſtants &amp; Puritants, but they are of one Church, faith, and religion. But we doubt whether they will ſtand to their poſitions they writ, in Queene</hi> Elizabeth <hi>daies, ſeeing they defend they may often change (at the leaſt at the change of euery Prince.</hi> Doue <hi>perſwaſion Pag.</hi> 31. Wherein let the reader iudge whether he hath dealt with me inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly or no? For I ſpake only of the manner of compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our Seruice booke, he chargeth me as if I had ſpoken of faith, materiall and ſubſtantiall points of religion. I ſpake of fact, what we did concerning our Seruice booke, and they concerning their Breauiry, which haue changed <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See the preface of Pope</hi> Pius 5. <hi>in</hi> Breuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Rom. ex decreto Synodus Trid. reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutum.</note> as often as we, he ſpeaketh of right, as if I had ſaid, we not onely then might, vpon ſuch good conſiderations, as then iuſtly moued vs, but alſo may euer hereafter, when there is no ſuch iuſt cauſe to induce vs thereunto, change and alter our faith and grounds of religion. My words were anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſticall, and by way of obiection from them, with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to their obiection, he doth make relation of them, as if they were dogmaticall, and as a grounded concluſion maintained among vs. Therefore I charge him with two fallacies. The firſt is, <hi>Fallacia accentus.</hi> For when wordes ſpoken interogatiuely are repeated indicatiuely, or words ſpoken ironically, as if they were ſpoken plainely, or by way of obiection, as if they were dogmaticall, and all ſuch like are referred to that fallacy. Secondly, he citeth part of my words, which are the obiection: and leaueth out the other part, which are the anſwere, which is comprehended
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:15903:31"/>
vnder the Elenche, called <hi>Fallacia diuiſionis,</hi> of which one ſpecies is: <hi>Quando citatur imperfecta ſententia, non integra, when part of the words are recited which the Sophiſter thinketh may ſerue his turne, the other part is omitted, leſt the whole ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſhould make againſt him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, he writeth thus: <hi>The viſible Church of Chriſt is a congregation of faithfull men, in which the pure word of God is preached, the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts duly adminiſtred, according to Chriſts ordinance, in all things that are of neceſſity required to the ſame,</hi> Couel, Field, Doue, <hi>be of the ſame minde,</hi> Perſwaſ. page. 23. I confeſſe, I am of the ſame minde, not onely in <hi>theſi,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in <hi>hypotheſi:</hi> that our Church is ſuch a congregation, that Gods word is truly preached, and the Sacraments duly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred among vs, according to Chriſt his inſtitution. But this is not with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> to fetch meat out of the eater. <note place="margin">Iudg. 14. 14.</note> Our words make for our ſelues, but yeeld no aduantage to our aduerſaries, among whom neither Gods word is truly preached, nor the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts duly adminiſtred. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are idlely produced by him, to delude the reader in making a ſhew of proofe for their religion, and of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for ours, when there is no MEDIVS TERMINVS, wherby any thing ſhould be proued or confuted. And if he apply it by <hi>hypotheſis</hi> to the Church of Rome, that it is ſuch a viſible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, &amp;c. and that therfore Recuſants may ſafely continue in it, and refuſe to communicate with vs, we were neuer of that minde, neither can that be any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant proofe. But it is a <hi>Petitio principij, begging of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,</hi> which he taketh as granted when it is denyed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thus: M. Williats <hi>words. To errors of doctrine which are not fundamentall, euen the true Church of Chriſt is ſubiect. So</hi> Field <hi>ordinarily in his bookes of the Church: ſo</hi> Sutcliffe, Doue Perſwa. pag. 31. 32. But what doth he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude out of theſe words? That therefore Recuſants may wilfully main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the errours of the Church of Rome, rather then be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to our Church, which is purged from ſuch errors? Theſe words are no Proteſtant proofe of Catholike reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15903:32"/>
                     <hi>Hoc eſt ludere, non argumentari,</hi> this is to play the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, not the Logitian.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he chargeth me in this manner: <hi>Concerning do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Doctor</hi> Doue <hi>writeth in theſe termes: In fundamentall points of doctrine, the greateſt Papiſts in the world agree with vs.</hi> Perſwaſ. page. 11. Theſe are my words; I deny them not. Moreouer, I did inſtance in theſe fundamentall points, wherein they conſent with vs, and thereupon I inferred, that they did raſhly condemne vs for heretickes, what then followeth? will he therefore inferre, that either holding the fundamentall points therefore their ſuperſtitions and errours may ſafely be maintained? or that therefore they may be iuſtly excuſed for not communicating with vs, as if their conſenting with vs in fundamentall points, ſhould be a cauſe why they ſhould the rather abhorre our Church &amp; religion? It is a ſufficient preiudice to the cauſe of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that they diſpute in ſuch looſe manner. Againe, he ſaith: <hi>So Doctor</hi> Doue <hi>in his whole Treatiſe neuer chargeth the Church of Rome, either with ſchiſme or hereſie, but laboureth to excuſe themſelues, offering that we ſhall communicate with them, without any change of opinion; and yet hee ſetteth downs this for an infallible poſition:</hi> THIS PROPOSITION IS VNDOVBTEDLY TRVE: NO HERETIKE, OR SCHIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MATIKE IS TO BE COMMVNICATED WITHAL. Perſwaſ. pag. 5. In that I haue not charged them with ſchiſme or hereſie, I haue ſhewed that we are more charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, then they are to vs, which do charge vs with both. In that hee ſaith: I onely laboured to excuſe our ſelues, as if I had proued nothing to cleare vs from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt aſpertion, I referre him to the place it ſelfe, where I haue made due proofe that we are free from both hereſie and ſchiſme, by ſuch ſound reaſons as this Author cannot anſwer. But whereas he ſaith it is offered on my part, that they ſhall at their pleaſure communicate with vs without change of opinion, he burdeneth me with an vntruth by himſelfe diuiſed, and not to bee quoted out of any of my
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15903:32"/>
bookes. In ſo writing, he may fill vp a volume, but he ſhall neuer ſtrengthen his owne cauſe, of weaken ours. <hi>Moreouer</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he giueth vs ſecurity that by no poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity (according to the former reaſon of generall Councels) the Romane Church can be iudged hereticall. His words bee theſe,</hi> pag. 14. <hi>No Church can be condemned and iudged hereticall by any priuate cenſure, but it muſt be publicke, by a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, as he there expoundeth himſelfe, and is granted before.</hi> But what doth he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude out of this? That becauſe the Church of Rome is not condemned by a generall Councell to bee hereticall; it muſt needs be therefore orthodoxall? This is ſuch a conſequent as neither Proteſtants, nor any other of ſound iudgement will grant.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, he chargeth me thus: <hi>Touching Sacraments, he alledgeth</hi> pag. 27. 28. <hi>that according to our definition of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, there are as many as we teach; and this ſhall not breede any iarre betweene vs; that therefore we ſhould refuſe to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate together. And tranſubſtantiation it ſelfe ſhall be no barre: but if we will receiue at their hands, they will not examine how we expound theſe words: Hoc eſt corpus meum, This is my body.</hi> pag. 29. <hi>And of diſcipline he writeth: In that Councell of Trent they ſet forth ſuch wholſome Canons concerning diſcipline, as were fit for a reformed Church.</hi> I deny not theſe words, but I deny that they make any thing for the defence of Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſancy. Concerning the word Sacrament, as it is a name diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by man, but not found in the Scriptures: ſo it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matter of ſaluation to vary about the number of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; eſpecially among them with whom it is not agreed what a Sacrament is: For, where words are not vnderſtood, <hi>ad idem, ſecundem idem, &amp;c.</hi> nothing hindereth, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or contradictory propoſitions may be both true, as to ſay: There are ſeuen, and there are not ſeuen Sacraments: For ſo concerning the number of Sacraments they and we differ in words when we may eaſily agree in ſubſtance. The word Sacrament is ſtrictly taken with vs, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to M. <hi>Caluin</hi> his definition; it is an outward ſigne
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:15903:33"/>
ordeined of God to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in his Church, as a part of his diuine Seruice, offering to all men, but ſealing onely to the faithfull his inward grace, for the ſtrengthening of their ſaith, &amp; the applying of Chriſt his death vnto them. And ſo there can be but two, according to the confeſſion of Saint <hi>Auguſtine: A reſurrectione Domini quaedam pauca</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">De doct. Chriſti lib. 3 cap. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>ſignapro multis, eademque factu facillima, intellectu auguſtiſſinta obſeruatione caſtiſſima ipſe Dominus &amp; Apoſtolica tradidit diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplina, baptiſmum &amp; coenam Domini: Since the Lord his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, our Sauiour his ſelfe, and from him his Apoſtles, haue commended to vs for outward ſignes, or ſeales, a very few in ſteed of many, and thoſe for performance moſt eaſie, for ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion moſt ample, for obſeruation moſt pure and holy, and they are Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper.</hi> But this word Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is more largely taken in the Church of Rome for a ſigne in generall, although it do not apply vnto vs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent before our eyes the death of Ieſus Chriſt. And it is defined to be <hi>Signum rei ſacra an outward ſigne of any holy thing.</hi> And according to that definition, there may be not <note place="margin">Cathechiſ. Romannus pars 2. de. ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram. ſect. 3.</note> only 7. but alſo 70. Sacraments. Of tranſubſtantion, hauing firſt proued that the bread and the wine in the Euchariſt cannot be tranſubſtantiated; and yet not denying them to be the body and bloud of our Sauiour, becauſe he hath ſaid they are ſo, I ſaid: in that we both agree, onely the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene vs, is, how the words: This is my body, are to be vnderſtood? whether really or ſacramentally, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or myſtically? And that it ſhould be no barre or ſcruple to their conſciences in what ſenſe we vnderſtand it, ſo as we deliuer it to them according to the inſtitution of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt: and that if they will in all other things ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues to the lawes of our Church, we will not preſſe them ſo farre in examining them how they expound the words, but rather yeeld ſo much to their weakneſſe in this one poynt, vntill God ſhall reueale a further meaſure of the knowledge of his truth vnto them. So theſe words of mine import nothing in fauour of tranſubſtantiation.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:15903:33"/>
Thirdly, the Councell of Trent hath ſet downe wholſome Canons co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning diſcipline, as in part the 3. Lataran Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell did long before; as namely, for preaching, and <note place="margin">Concil. La. tar. 3. Can. 13. &amp; Con. cil. 4. Later. Can. 29.</note> learned miniſters, &amp;c. And the reformed Churches of England, Scotland, Germany, Netherland, Geneua, haue receiued many of thoſe Canons, although they come from the Pope, as deeming them fit for a reformed Church. But theſe my words make nothing for the allowance of that Councell it ſelfe, or of the points of doctrine there conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; neither yet of their Recuſancy, among whom for the moſt part, theſe Canons of diſcipline are not receiued.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Concerning the Popes ſupremacy, of Europe there can be no queſtion. For, generally Proteſtants agree with</hi> Field, Doue, Ormerod, <hi>that the regiment of the Weſt Churches (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which this nation is one) belonged to the Pope of Rome.</hi> Page. 29. 30. I ſpake of the Popes ſupremacy, and my words are theſe: What authority ſoeuer the Pope had ouer the Latine Church, or Weſt part of the world, it hath bene giuen him by humane conſtitutions onely, and generall conſent of Princes and States, which they ſuffered him to enioy during their good liking, and no longer. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thus ſhewed that the Popes authority ouer other Churches, was not by diuine inſtitution, but onely by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane permiſſion; not certaine, but during the pleaſure of Princes and States: my words fauour not his ſupremacy ouer vs in England, out of which by conſent of Prince and Parliament, hee hath beene abandoned long ſince. And therefore, I ſay, the Biſhop of Rome is little beholding to me for his title of ſupremacy: This is a very looſe and negligent kinde of diſputation.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, ſaith he, Doue Perſw. pag. 15. <hi>referreth the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion what books be Canonicall Scriptures to the two Doctors,</hi> S. Auguſtine <hi>and</hi> S. Hierom. <hi>His words be theſe: Catholikes proue them to be Canonical out of S.</hi> Auguſtine: <hi>we, that they be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cripha, out of</hi> S. Hierome; <hi>both which Doctors: are of no ſmal authority in the Church of Rome: therefore in this we differ no
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15903:34"/>
more from them, then</hi> S. Hierome <hi>did from</hi> S. Auguſtine. <hi>Therefore I hope for many cauſes Proteſtants will giue place to us in this queſtion.</hi> I deny not, but the queſtion being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded concerning the bookes of <hi>Toby, Iudith, Baruch, Eccleſiasticus, Wiſedome,</hi> the <hi>Maccabes,</hi> and the fragment of <hi>Eſther,</hi> whether they were Canonicall, (as the Church of Rome doth hold) or <hi>Apocripha,</hi> as our Church main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth? I anſwered: that foraſmuch as there is <hi>Canon fidei, &amp; morum, One Canon or rule of good life, another of faith:</hi> and that may be <hi>Canon morum, quodnon est fidei, Arule and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of good life for vs to follow, which is not a ſufficient ground of doctrine to build our faith vpon:</hi> they were both Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, and Apocripha: Canonicall, according to Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtins,</hi> for rules of good life: Apocripha, according to S. <hi>Hierome;</hi> becauſe they were no true grounds of doctrine. And ſo the Church of Rome and our ſelues, rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding one another, as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> and Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vnderſtood themſelues, there needed not be any difference concerning this point betweene vs. But how can he inferre vpon this: that therefore we muſt giue place to him in this queſtion? As Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> gaue no place to Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> ſo will we giue no place to any; onely I wiſh they would better vnderſtand both vs and themſelues, and giue place to the truth. And, foraſmuch as they allow both of Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> and Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> to be Orthodoxall Doctors, they cannot receiue S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> his opinion, but they muſt alſo embrace S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> expoſition, where it is explained what is the meaning of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> where hee alloweth thoſe bookes to be Canonicall.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, ſaith he, <hi>Concerning the vulgar Latine tranſlation allowed among Catholikes, D.</hi> Doue <hi>writeth thus,</hi> pag. 16. <hi>We grant it fit, that for vniformity, in quotation of places in Schooles, and Pulpits, one Latine text ſhould be vſed, and we can bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented for the antiquity thereof, to preferre the old vulgar tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, before all other Latine bookes; and ſo much we yeeld to the Councell of Trent.</hi> The praemiſſes are mine, but what is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15903:34"/>
his concluſion? Becauſe we aſcribe to the vulgar edition, more then to all other Latine tranſlations; and therein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Church of Rome: and becauſe we yeeld to the Councell of Trent ſo farre as reaſon doth require, and no further; but diſagree both from the Church of Rome, and that Councel in things which are erroneous: <hi>Concedendo vera, negando falſa,</hi> will he therefore take this for a Proteſtant proofe of his Catholicke religion? <hi>Non taliauxilio, nec de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſoribus iſtis Roma caret:</hi> If the Church of Rome had no better champions, it would not ſtand.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>Doctor</hi> Couel <hi>writeth: No tranſlation whatſoeuer is authenticall Scripture. And Doctor</hi> Doue <hi>addeth: All tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations haue many faults.</hi> page. 16. In ſo writing, I write the truth. For onely God is free from errour; and therefore on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the originall text is authenticall Scripture. All men are ſubiect to errours, <hi>Omnis homo mendax,</hi> but all tranſlations are the workes of men. But how idlely is this brought in as a Proteſtant proofe of Recuſancy? well may it ſerue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Recuſants, which aſcribe more to the tranſlation the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the originall. If no tranſlation be authenticall, then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth as a firme conſequent, that the vulgar Latine editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be authentical, howſoeuer the Councel of Trent hath impoſed it vpon vs as authenticall.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, <hi>For this time and place</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will only make amplification of Doctor</hi> Doue, <hi>his grant &amp; confeſſion, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in theſe words: When the Maſſe was firſt put down, King</hi> Henry <hi>had his Engliſh litourgie, and that was then iudged abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute without all exception. But when King</hi> Edward <hi>came to the Crowne, that was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, and another was in the place; which</hi> Peter Martyr, <hi>and</hi> Bucet <hi>did approue as very conſonant to Gods word. When Q.</hi> Elizabeth <hi>began her reign, the former was iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be full of imperfections, and a new was diuiſed, &amp; allowed by conſent of the Clergy.

booke of Common praier, we bee ſo want on we know not what we would haue.</hi> Pag. 31. <hi>Hitherto his words, and he freely confeſſed errours in all theſe ſtates and changes.</hi> For defence whereof, beſides that theſe words are written by way of obiection from them, rather then any confeſſion made by our ſelues: I did not ſo much as intimate that there were errours in all theſe ſtates and changes, as he vniuſtly chargeth me; but onely that in the Seruice bookes of King <hi>Henry,</hi> and King <hi>Edward,</hi> ſome things were iudged to ſauor of the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church of Rome. But as for the Seruice booke which was allowed by Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it ſtood not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly during her time without alteration, but alſo it is ratified by his Maieſtie, and allowed of by the State; albeit by ſome particularmen it hath bene impugned, as nothing elſe can be by the wit of man ſo well deuiſed, but mans wit can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt it. And as for thoſe errours which were refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the books of K. <hi>Henry,</hi> and King <hi>Edward,</hi> they were the ſuperſtitions onely of the Church of Rome, the land being not then ſufficiently reformed, nor purity of religion ſo perfectly eſtabliſhed, as now it is, becauſe the Biſhops &amp; Clergy men by whom thoſe bookes were written, their ſelues were too much ſo wred with the Romiſh leauen. And our daily renouncing thoſe ſuperſtitions, and receiuing greater light of the Goſpell, could be no Proteſtant proofe that we ſhould any way fauour their ſuperſtitions.</p>
                  <p>Eleuenthly, he writeth thus: <hi>Why may we not ſay with the Councell of Florence, cited by M.</hi> Williat <hi>for Generall, and the Patriarkes of the Apoſtolike ſeas there preſent, and the Councel of Conſtance, not of vnequall authority, &amp; the Councell of Trent (to paſſe others) with 6. Cardinals, 4. Legats, 3. Patriarkes, 32. Arch-biſhops, 228. Biſhops, and 5. Abbots there aſſembled, (as Doctor</hi> Doue <hi>telleth vs) that Proteſtancy in all places is falſe, and Catholicke religion true; where no Proteſtant Church can ſhew any one ſuch like authority for their cauſe? The third part of ſuch an aſſembly would haue bene a great countenance to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant religion, farre greater then euer it had, or is likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:15903:35"/>
To which I anſwer: Firſt, concerning the Councell of Florence, in all thoſe 25. Seſſions which in it were: held, 15. of them being at Ferraria, where the Councell began, and the other at Florence, where the Councel was concluded, there is ſcarce any one point of religion touched, of which there is any controuerſie betweene Proteſtants and Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants; onely while it was at Ferraria, before the acts of the firſt Seſſion, the queſtion of Purgatory was ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially diſputed. Therefore that Councell was farre from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demning Proteſtancy, or approuing Catholike religion. Secondly, of the Councell of Conſtance, which he will haue to be of no leſſe authority: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his ſelfe deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to haue any authority at all, or credit of a generall <note place="margin">De Concil. l. 1. cap. 7.</note> Councell, alledging that it is in the Catalogue of thoſe 15. Synods which the Catholicke Church hath not receiued. It ſeemeth therefoe that this Author was not well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the generall Councels. Thirdly, as I confeſſed ſuch a number of Prelates to be preſent at the Councell of Trent, ſo I alledged reaſons why it could not bee a lawfull councell; which he is ſo farre from anſwering, that he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them ouer with ſilence. As alſo he ſpareth to repeate the reſidue of my words, which make againſt him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his accuſtomed fallacy, wherein I derogated from the credit of this aſſembly, ſhewing that they were there onely at the end of the Councell, being then newly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Pope to countenace the Synod, and ſo to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to all concluſions for forme ſake. But at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when matters were argued, there were but forty Biſhops, and foure Legates, too ſmall an aſſembly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the name of a generall Councell. Albeit, it is not a bare multitude of ſuffrages, and preſence of Biſhops, that can giue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance to a generall Councell. For the whole multitude of Prieſts and others cryed againſt our Sauiour Chriſt: Crucifie him. The Kings ſtood vp, and the Princes tooke councell together againſt the Lord, and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted. <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 50 Pſal. 2. 2.</note>

                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:15903:36"/>
So then, if he argue from the Councell of Florence, to condemne our religion, I deny his antecedent. If from the Councell of Conſtance, I deny his argument: If from the Councell of Trent, it is but a Fallacy, <hi>Petitio principij;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee taketh that for a proofe, which is the matter in diſpute.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N my perſwaſion to the Recuſants to reconcile themſelues to our Church, I vſed theſe words: <hi>The ignorant Recuſant pretendeth his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſaying: It is againſt my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to come to Church; and, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer I do againſt my conſcience, is ſin. I confeſſe, whatſoeuer is done without teſtimony or warrant of conſcience, is ſin to them that do it, be that which is done in it ſelfe neuer ſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith: He that doubteth, is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned if he eate, becauſe he eateth not of faith; and whatſoeuer is</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>not of faith, is ſinne. In which words, by faith, is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood conſcience. But by the way, they muſt ſee that their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be rightly informed, elſe it will bee their damnation.</hi> Out of which words, M. <hi>Walſingham</hi> maketh this collection: <hi>That I ſeemed to him, ſubſtantially to iuſtifie out of theſe words of S.</hi> Paul, <hi>the Recuſancy of Catholickes, if they can proue they haue a good ground, or motiue of conſcience.</hi> It is true, one ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity being granted, many others will follow. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15903:39"/>
to this hypothetical propoſition, I anſwer, by granting the Maior, and denying the Minor. For they cannot proue they haue any ſuch good ground or motiue of conſcience; therfore their Reculancy is not iuſtified out of theſe words. It is but <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> a begging of the queſtion. Againe, he ſaith: <hi>If their conſcience were erroneous, and grounded vpon falſe grounds, and principles: yet, ſo long as that perſwaſion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth, it ſeemeth they may not be forced.</hi> The inſufficiency of which argument I will lay open by the like. Hee that hath not examined himſelfe, may not come to the Lords table, leſt he eate and drinke vnworthily; and ſo <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 28. 29.</note> eate and drinke his owne damnation, not diſcerning the Lords body. Shall this want of examination of a mans ſelfe, be therefore a warrant to any man to liue like an infidell? neuer to examine himſelfe? and ſo neuer to come to the Lords table? and ſo to be exempted from the authority, and coactiue power of the Church? He muſt be forced to examine himſelfe, and communicate: So the Recuſant, whoſe conſcience is erroneous, and founded vpon falſe principles, muſt be forced to renounce his errours, to build his religion, vpon ſounder principles, to receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and informe his conſcience better, and ſo to come to the Church.</p>
                  <p>He taketh vpon him to diſproue my definition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which is, that it is an application of a generall knowledge, grounded vpon Gods word to particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and intents. He ſaith: <hi>This definition is defectiue, being not ſo large as the thing that is defined; becauſe the heathens which know not Gods word, yet haue a conſcience grounded onely vpon the law of nature.</hi> I anſwer, that if conſcience be by him <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 14.</note> vniuocally vnderſtood, (as all things ought to be which are defined) my definition cannot be diſproued. But when he inſtanceth in the conſciences of heathen men, he flyeth to equiuocation, whereas an equiuocall thing cannot bee defined. In like manner, if I ſhould define religion to be a rule of faith and life, grounded vpon Gods word, he might
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15903:39"/>
take the ſame exception againſt it, and ſay, that the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Turkes is grounded vpon the Alcaron; the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Iewes is grounded partly vpon the Talmod: the religion of the Catholickes partly vpon the Traditions of men. If I define a man to be <hi>animal rationale,</hi> a body indued with a reaſonable ſoule, he may likewiſe ſay that definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on agreeth not with a painted man, or the picture of a man. As ſpeaking of religion, I define not falſe religion; but the true Chriſtian religion: and ſpeaking of a man, I define not an equiuocall, or analogicall, but an vniuocall man: So I define not a darke and erroneous, but a ſound, and true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding conſcience. As for the heathens, they haue yet left ſome reliques of the image of God, which are reaſon &amp; vnderſtanding. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith: The Gentiles which haue not the law, do by nature the things contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the law, hauing not the law, they are a law to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which ſhew the effects of the law written in their hearts, their conſciences alſo bearing witneſſe, and their thoughts accuſing one another, or excuſing: that is, the Gentiles haue not the law abſolutely, and in ſuch perfect manner as the Iewes, to whom God deliuered euery pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the law expreſſely by writing; yet they haue, will they, nill they, written in their hearts ſome feeling of religion, and are able to put a difference betweene vertue and vice; which ſufficeth onely to their damnation. They do by nature, <hi>ea quae legis ſunt,</hi> the things contained in the law: that is, they command things which are honeſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the things which are vniuſt, ſet downe puniſhments for theft, adultery, and ſuch like offences. But by the way: <hi>Aliud eſt facere quod lex iubet, aliud facere quod lex facit, aut ea quae legis ſunt facere.</hi> It is one thing to doe what the law commandeth, (for that they do not, that were to keepe the law) another thing to do the things contained in the law, or to do as the law doth: that is, onely to command the things which the law commandeth, and to forbid what the law forbiddeth; which onely the Gentiles do. Neither
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15903:40"/>
do they that fully, but onely in ſome part, concerning out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things; but are farre from the knowledge of true pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety to ſaue their ſoules. So then, the conſcience of the Gentiles being ſufficiently inſtructed without Gods word, by the light of nature, onely to their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what doth that concerne my purpoſe which define a conſcience rightly informed, and ſufficiently grounded to ſaluation?</p>
                  <p>He goeth about to diſproue my definition of hereſie, which I defined to be: an errour ſtiffely and obſtinately maintained and defended; not by a conſequent, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly impugning ſome article of faith. Which definition he ſaith <hi>is alſo defectiue, becauſe it is not ſo large as the thing which is defined.</hi> His words are theſe: <hi>For if we looke into all the hereſies recorded by Ireneus, Tertullian, Epiphanius, Saint Auguſtine, &amp;c. we ſhall not find the leſt part directly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely, againſt any article of the Apoſtles Creed, which M. D. Doue a little after doth ſay he meaneth, as of the Pelagians, which holdeth that a man may do good workes by the power of his owne free will without grace, the Aetians, that faith was ſufficient without good workes to life euerlaſting, and that Christ had reuealed more to them, then to the Apoſtles, the Aerians that denied prayer, and ſacrifices for the dead, and ſet fasts of the Church. Neither can D. Doue proue that his owne example of the Arian hereſie by him alleaged, did directly impugne any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Creed, but by a conſequent. For Arius denied the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of the Sonne with the Father, and by a conſequent his Godhead, and ſo by a conſequent the ſecond article of the Creed: Ieſus Chriſt his onely Sonne our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, I anſwer, he hath not dealt ingenuouſly with me. For I did not in my definition of hereſie reſtraine Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Creed of the Apoſtles, as the place it ſelfe will plainely ſhew; for I did mention not onely that Creed, but alſo the Creed of Nice, of Epheſus, of Conſtantinople, <note place="margin">Perſwaſ. pag. 13.</note> which I ſayd we hold, and alſo the text of the Bible, to free vs from hereſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:15903:40"/>
Secondly, the Pelagian holding that a man could do good workes by the power of his owne free will without grace: directly impugneth faith, euen the text of the Bible, where it is written: <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelues to thinke</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 5</note> 
                     <hi>any thing as of our ſelues, but our ſufficiency is of God. O Lord I</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 10. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>know that the way of man is not in himſelfe; neither is it in man to walke and direct his ſteppes. All the imaginations of the</hi>

                     <hi>thoughts of mans heart are onely euill continually. The naturall man perceaueth not the things that are of God. We are dead in ſinnes. No man can ſay that Ieſus is the Lord, but by the Spirit of God.</hi> The Aëtian ſaying: Faith without good workes is ſufficient to eternall life, directly, denieth the doctrine of the Bible: <hi>What auaileth it my brethren, though a man ſay he hath faith when he hath no workes? can the faith ſaue him? If faith haue no workes it is dead.</hi> Whereas the Aetian holdeth that Chriſt hath reuealed more to him then to the Apoſtles, it is expreſſely, and directly againſt the Scriptures, where S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>I haue kept nothing backe, but haue ſhewed you</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 20. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>all the counſell of God.</hi> That the Arians denied the Godhead of Chriſt, not by a conſequent onely, but directly, witnes S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> For S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith that <note place="margin">Ad quod vult. cap. 49.

That he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for an hereticke, it was not ſo much for theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as for that firſt being a Schiſmaticke, becauſe he could not obtaine a Biſhopricke he became an Arian, as it appeareth by S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> his words are theſe: <hi>Doluiſſe

But by the way, that I may giue good ſatisfaction to the reader concerning this poynt. We find in the catalogue of hereſies many reckoned vp, which are ſo farre from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly impugning faith, that indeed they do not at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the faith, as that of <hi>Aerius,</hi> which denied prayer and ſacrifice for the dead, and the ſet faſts of the Church. To which I anſwer out of S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Firſt, theſe Fathers which make ſuch long catalogues of hereſies, do not write as if they in their owne iudgements did hold all theſe to be hereſies; but onely they deliuer what opinions in ſeuerall ages haue bene condemned as hereticall, leauing it to the priuate iudgement of the reader, whether they were iuſtly condemned as hereticall, or not: but their ſelues deliuer not what is their owne iudgement.

Secondly, the Fathers in thoſe Catalogues did not vnderſtand this word Hereſie, ſo ſtrictly as in our age it is vnderſtood; but generally for euery ſect in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, differing from the receiued opinion of the Church, as <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Quod vult.</note> it appeareth by S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the words going before, where hee maketh an hereſie and a ſect all one, ſhewing: <hi>Quantum inter ſe differunt de numero ſectarum.</hi> How much <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Philaſtrius</hi> diſcent concerning the number of ſects? where he calleth them ſects, which before he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hereſies. And it is no maruaile though with thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theres, all hereſies do not directly impugne the Faith, when by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely ſects are vnderſtood. But to make euery opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion an hereſie which not only, directly, but alſo by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent impugneth faith, as M. <hi>Walſingham</hi> will haue it, is to make no difference betweene errour and hereſie; but <note place="margin">De corrup. artib.</note> to call euery errour in religion an hereſie, as <hi>Ludouicus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iues</hi> ſpeaketh: <hi>Haereſis nomen rebus leuiſſimis impingitur,</hi> The name of hereſie is layd vpon euery light matter. And <note place="margin">De haereſ. <hi>l.</hi> 1. cap. 7.</note> of him it may one time or other be verified which <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus de Caſtro</hi> ſpeaketh: <hi>Idcirco fit, vt hiqui tam leuiter de hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſi pronuntiant, non expendentes de quâre loquantur, ſaepè ſuà ipſorum ſagittâ feriantur, incidant<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> in eam foueam quam alijs parabant.</hi> It happeneth that they which ſo raſhly call eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing hereſie, not conſidering whereof they ſpeake, bee oftentimes beaten with their owne weapon, and fall into
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15903:42"/>
the pit which they digged for others.</p>
                  <p>I ſhewed, pag. 10. how Puſillanimity maketh men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do contrary to their owne conſcience, as Cardinall <hi>Pole,</hi> who dying ſaid: The Proteſtants are the honeſter men, I would be a Proteſtant, were it not for the Church of Rome. This I brought for example to illuſtrate, not for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to proue. For <hi>exempla non probant,</hi> examples proue not. He turneth it another way, ſaying: I broughtit for a reaſon to proue that Proteſtants are no heretickes.</p>
                  <p>In defence of our Church, that it could not be accounted hereticall, I called into queſtion the authority of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent by which it was condemned, alledging di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers exceptions againſt that Councell, that it could not be a lawfull generall Councell, the paucity of the Biſhops which were there preſent, their partiality, the definition of a generall Councell cited by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which could no <note place="margin">Tomo. 1. contro. 4. cap. 4.</note> way be verified of that aſſembly. Hauing produced theſe arguments to diſinable that Councell, he doth not ſo much as repeate any of them; much leſſe doth he anſwer them: onely he ſaith, that it ſeemed to him a ſlight argument, and to giue more aduantage to my aduerſary, then defence to my ſelfe and my cauſe. I reply, that it is no maruaile though a man of ſlight iudgement, which paſſeth ouer all other things of moment ſo ſlightly, doe eſteeme thoſe arguments to be ſo ſlight, which his ſelfe cannot anſwer.</p>
                  <p>To perſwade Catholikes to come to our Church, I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how the learned among them, do come euery day nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to our religion, and more and more fauour our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He ſaith it is a dreame. I wiſh this dreamer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake out of ſleepe, and with greater vigilancy to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the particulars as they are produced by mee, I ſaid:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the learned Catholickes agree with vs concerning the bookes of Scripture which be Canonicall, which Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cripha, I writ in this maner: <hi>The bookes of</hi> Toby, Iudith, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruch, Eccleſiaſticus, Wiſdome, Maccabes, the fragment of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15903:42"/>
Eſther, <hi>they hold to be Canonicall, according to S.</hi> Auguſtine: <hi>We, to be Apocripha, according to S.</hi> Hierome; <hi>and in this point we differ no more from them, then</hi> Hierome <hi>did from</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, <hi>which did both agree, and were eaſily reconciled.</hi> S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome <hi>interpreting</hi> S. Auguſtines <hi>meaning: that they were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall enough to proue rules of life, not grounds of doctrine and faith. Thus haue we deliuered long ſince. But</hi> Bellarmine <note place="margin">De verbo Dei. l. 1. c. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>handling this queſtion at large, replieth not againſt vs: nay, hee doth not ſo much as mention this diſtinction of Canons of faith, and Canons of good life. Therefore we take it as a thing granted by the lawes of diſputation, that he holdeth as we hold, reſteth ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with our anſwer, &amp; the caſe to be cleare betweene vs both.</hi> M. <hi>Walſingham</hi> bluſheth not to deliuer a notorious vntruth, ſaying: that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> handleth this diſtinction at large, and refuteth the ſame in his firſt booke, <hi>De verbo Dei, cap.</hi> 10. In which booke and chapter, no ſuch thing can be found.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they agree with vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Bible, which is the beſt and trueſt edition. For wheras we holding the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall text only to be authenticall, the Councell of Trent <note place="margin">Decret. 3. Seſsionis.</note> obtrudeth to vs the vulgar Latine tranſlation. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> preferreth the original before the Latine, as we do. M. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham</hi> is not aſhamed to charge me that I haue abuſed both the Councell of Trent and <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> That I haue not abuſed the Councell, witneſſe the Councell it ſelfe: that I haue not abuſed <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> witneſſe <hi>Bellarmine De verbo Dei, lib. 2. cap.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they agree with vs concerning the ſufficiency of the Scriptures, that in them are deliuered all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſaluation, contrary to the ancient doctrine of the Church of Rome. So <hi>Bellarmine, De verbo Dei, lib. 4. cap.</hi> 10. He is not aſhamed to ſay: In reading the place hee hath diſcouered a notable fraude. Whether I haue dealt fraudulently or ſincerely, let the reader iudge. But wherein lyeth the fraude? He ſaith that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth theſe words onely by way of anſwer to an obiection.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:15903:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I conclude therefore it is no fraude. If I had taken that for poſitiue doctrine which was ſpoken by way of obiection, it had bene fraude in me; but ſeeing it is an anſwer to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, it is no fraude, but ſincere dealing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they hold with vs that Purgatory is a tradition, and not to be found in the holy Scriptures, witneſſe <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine de verbo Dei. l. 4. c.</hi> 4. He thinketh to auoid vs by ſaying that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaketh onely antagoniſtically, by way of obiection out of <hi>Luther,</hi> and not dogmatically out of his owne iudgement; which is but <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> a begging of the queſtion. For it was queſtioned by me, whether <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> ſpake out of his owne iudgement, or not? and the affirmatiue was by me proued &amp; concluded. He bringeth no proofe for the negatiue part, but onely maketh that for his allegation, which is the queſtion it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, they diſcent not from vs about the authority of the Scriptures, that it is aboue the authority of the Church; witneſſe <hi>Bellarmine de verbo Dei. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 10. He repeateth the words, but maketh no anſwer to them.</p>
                  <p>He chargeth me with Papiſtry, becauſe I confeſſed that our Church was condemned as hereticall by the Councell of Trent; which is but <hi>Petitio principij:</hi> for I denyed our Church to be euer the more hereticall for the cenſure of that Councell, whoſe authoriry I diſinabled by ſufficient reaſons, to which he maketh no anſwer: and therefore in that place I haue not played the Papiſt.</p>
                  <p>Whereas I exhorted the Recuſants, diligently to reade, as well our writers, as their owne; our anſwers as well as their obiections; and then to examine their owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before they paſſe their ſentence againſt vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vs of hereſie: He maketh two anſwers: firſt, that they haue already done ſo, to which I reply: they haue done it partially. Secondly, that vnlearned men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not able to do ſo; and therefore they muſt relye vpon the iudgement of the Catholicke Church. To which I reply, that if they be not able, the fault is in the the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:15903:43"/>
Church of Rome, which holdeth the people ſtill in ignorance, whereas S. <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth, that they ought to be of ſuch knowledge, as to try and examine the Spirits: and the Citizens of Berea are commended by the holy <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4. 1. Act. 17. 11. 2. Cor. 4. 3.</note> Ghoſt, becauſe they were able to examine Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And I ſay with the Apoſtle: That if the Goſpell bee hidden, it is hidden to them which are loſt.</p>
                  <p>I alledged that few things are in our booke of Common praiers, which are not taken out of the Bible, or out of that which was good in the Maſſe booke: ſo that if they allow of the Bible &amp; their Maſſe booke, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not diſallow of our Seruice book. He anſwereth in theſe words: <hi>If all the Seruice booke were taken out of the Bible it ſelfe, (as moſt of all heretical Seruice hath bene in euery age pretended to be) yet might the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and combination be ſuch as might make it vnlawfull and peſtiferous: as when the Arrians did ſing: Gloria patri cum filio, &amp; per filium, and the Catholickes, &amp; filio. The difference in ſound of words, was ſmall; but in ſubſtance and malice execrable.</hi> To which I reply, that foraſmuch as he maketh ſuch a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but ſheweth no ſuch collection or combination in our Seruice booke; neither any thing in it like to that of the Arrians, he ſpeaketh idlely, and to no purpoſe; neither is any thing thereby derogated from the credit of our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice booke.</p>
                  <p>To the Recuſants which obiect that there are diſſentions among vs: I anſwered, that ſo there were among them: I named <hi>Eckius, Pighius, Thomas, Scotus:</hi> nay, there were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions among the Apoſtles themſelues: ſo that diſſention is no argument to diſinable vs from being the true Church, for in religion we agree. M. <hi>Walſingham</hi> chargeth me with three abſurdities: the firſt of ignorance or folly; for that <hi>Eckius, Pighius, Thomas, Scotus</hi> diſſented onely in matters diſputable, and not determined by the Church for points of faith. In which words he maketh the Church of Rome to be ſo negligent in their determination of matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as if they held the doctrine of iuſtification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:15903:44"/>
                     <hi>Eckius</hi> and <hi>Pighius</hi> diſagreed, and of merit wherein the Thomiſts and Scotiſt diſagreed not to appertaine vnto faith, and to be matters ſo indifferent, as if they afforded onely cauſe of diſputation, but needed not to be diſcided.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond abſurditie he ſaith is impiety, for that the Apoſtles contentions were not about matters of different doctrine. I ſay no more are ours. The third he ſaith is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous audacity, to deny ſo abſolutely diſagreement in matters of religion among vs, whereof the whole world can be witneſſe out of our owne books, and inuectiues one againſt another. To which I anſwer, that albeit ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular factious ſpirits among vs write ſeditious pamphlets one againſt another, this imputation cannot iuſtly be layd vpon our Church, which by all manner of good meanes ſuppreſſeth diſſention, but maintaineth peace and vnitie. Thus much I thought fit to deliuer, not for anſwer to his diſgracefull ſpeeches vttered againſt me, which I paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with ſilence, as not touching the cauſe of religion, but in defence onely of the truth which I tooke in hand, that our aduerſarie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may vnderſtand how we haue not ſuffered thoſe things ſo looſely to paſſe our hands, which they ſo looſely haue publiſhed againſt vs, to the view of the world, And ſo leauing them to the mercy of the Lord, my prayer is: <hi>Vincat Christus, cadat haereſis,</hi> that falſhood may ſtill be detected, and truth may get the vpper hand.</p>
