            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not the weight and excellency of what is here presented that may plead for so Noble a Patronage as your Lordships is: it is the Subject, not the Work; the Text, and not the Comment that deserves both your Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Perusal. For, my Lords, you have here <hi>Moses,</hi> that Grand Legislator of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> dedicated to you that are the reverend Iudges under the <hi>New.</hi> His Laws have been the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of the whole World; and this small <hi>Pentateuch</hi> hath proved the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work for the <hi>Pandects</hi> of all Nations to build upon. In this respect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it may claim a kind of propriety and right to your Honourable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, and take the presumption to shelter it self under your grave long Robes. Here indeed are no Controversies stated, no Law-cases judged and determined: My Sole design and endeavours have been to make our great Law-giver <hi>Moses</hi> altogether Practical, and wholly applicable to
<pb facs="tcp:36907:3"/>
the Life and Conversation of Christians. In these sheets then you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed those Antient Patriarcks of Gods Church, who were also Aecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Iudges, and so not unfitting guids for your Honours to follow, where their steps have been straight and upright; nay their very slips and devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may serve to make us stand more firm, and our treadings more stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and setled in the wayes of Godliness, and Iourny towards Heaven. But if your Lordships had rather walk by Rule than Example, here is that Moral everlasting Rule of God himself in the Book of <hi>Exodus</hi> to direct you: and withal that you may see how proper and convenient even a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law is for Gods Church, you have a whole Book of it in <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus;</hi> and this also decreed and setled after those necessary Acts of the Ten Commandments: as if the very Moral Law it self had not been curb sufficient to keep in a Rebellious People without some binding Ceremonies. And here, my Lords, I must needs confess upon the sad experience of Schism under both <hi>Testaments;</hi> that all those Laws <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> have not been powerful enough to settle the Peace of Gods Church: something was wanting to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and is at this day to us, which under God is only able to produce that great and glorious Work; and that is a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council. This General Council, my Lords, hath ever been the most approved successful way of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> to compose her differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and it is this also that will prevent the ruin of our own miserably devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>National Church,</hi> and frustrate the design of that <hi>Politick Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme</hi> of some, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> must be ruin'd by the same way that it was reform'd; for <hi>(say they)</hi> it was reform'd by <hi>Schisme,</hi> and it must be ruin'd by <hi>Schisme.</hi> Now to prevent this ruine contrived by <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> I know not any way more Prudential, more blessed by God, than a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council; to procure this, that every Peaceful Christian (and such are your Honours) may joyn the strongest Forces of his Endeavours, shall be the daily Prayers of,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was a Time (or something like to that) before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Time, when God did not work, and yet was not idle. For though we grant that there was no External work of the Godhead until the making of the World, yet can there be no necessary illation of Idleness in the Deity: seeing it might have (as indeed it had) actions immanent, included within the circle of the Trinity. Just so ought it to be with every Christian, who though he doth not alwayes perform the outward actions of Religion, yet he may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be imployed within himself in some practice of Christianity: holy Thoughts, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Meditations, mental Prayer, faithful Vows and Resolutions are those inward imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent operations of a Christian, whereby he may imitate his Creator in not working, and yet not being idle. But then when he doth begin to express himself in some outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let him here also follow the example of his Maker: and whereas it is said, in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning God created the Heaven and the Earth, first the Heaven, and then the Earth; so et our actions respect chiefly Heavenly matters, in the first place let us exercise our selves
<pb facs="tcp:36907:4"/>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:36907:5"/>
in those things that are above; and when from those we descend to things below, let even those Terrestrial affairs look upwards, and be fix'd and terminated in Heaven: and let all this be done by way of Creation too; let our Gifts, and Graces, and Endowments be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to arise from nothing in our selves, and let every faculty of our Souls be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Gods Will as the Creation was to his Command, for he spake the word and they were made: so when God speaks let us hear, and let our will be actuated, and formed, and regulated by his voice, as the whole World was by his Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. The word <hi>(Ferebatur)</hi> in the vulgar Latine, in the English <hi>(moved)</hi> denotes both motion and rest, beginnings, and wayes, and ends. We may best consider the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the stirring of the Holy Ghost in zeal, and the rest of the Holy Ghost in moderation. If we be without zeal, we have not the motion, if we be without moderation we have not the rest, the peace of the Holy Ghost: he moved and he rested upon the Waters in the Creation (as the word <hi>Incubabat</hi> doth imply;) he came and tarried still upon Christ in his Baptism. He moves us to a zeal of laying hold of the means of Salvation which God offers us in the Church, and he settles us in a peaceful Conscience, that by having well used those means, we are made his Children. A holy hunger and thirst of the Word and Sacraments, a remorse and compunction for former sins, a zeal to promote the cause and glory of God by word and deed, this is the motion of the Holy Ghost; and then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my self with Gods measure of temporal blessings, and for spiritual, that I do serve God faithfully in that Calling which I lawfully profess, as far as that Calling will admit; this peace of Conscience, this acquiescence of having done that that belongs unto me, this is the Rest of the Holy Ghost of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. In the first the old Creation, God the Father said, <hi>Fiat lux,</hi> let there be light in this greater World; in the Second the New Creation or Regeneration of Man, God the Holy Ghost said, <hi>Fiat cognitio Dei in anima hominis;</hi> let there be the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in the mind of man, of man this lesser world. God the Father said, <hi>Fiat Firmamentum,</hi> let there be a Firmament; God the Holy Ghost said, <hi>Firmetur volunt as in bono,</hi> let the will of Man be confirmed in that which is good. God the Father said, let the Waters be gathered together in one place; God the Holy Ghost said, let many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be united in one soul. God the Father said, <hi>Fiant luminaria in Coelo,</hi> let there be lights in Heaven; God the Holy Ghost saith, let the lights of Faith, Hope, and Charity be fixed in a believing Soul. God the Father said, <hi>Fiant volatilia,</hi> let there be flying Fouls; God the Holy Ghost saith, let there be religious Meditations in the mind of man soaring upward. And thus in every thing the work of our spiritual Creation is answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Work of our temporal in the beginning of the World, and the operations of the Third Person in the blessed Trinity upon our Souls now are but as so many parallel Lines drawn from the actions of the First Person of the same blessed Trinity upon our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. In this and several other Verses of this Chapter it is said, that at the dayes end, <hi>God looked upon the whole that he had made, and he saw that it was good,</hi> and at the end of the week taking a view of all his works together, <hi>he saw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good, Gen.</hi> 1. 31. which sheweth, that after God had done his Works, he did reflect upon them, and considered the quality and the condition of them. In imitation hereof Wise men do wish us, that at every dayes end we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon our Works, and take a view of what we have done that day, and at the Weeks end take an account of all our doings for that space of time, and fo further as further oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion shall require. And this enquiry or account taking of our Works, they call the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of our Souls or Consciences. And surely if we did observe this rule, though we could not find our Works, as God did his Works, to be good, and very good, but rather naught, and very naught, yet by this searching into our Works we may without all doubt make our Works for the future much better than they are for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. God here calls the Sun and the Moon two great Lights, because, though there be greater in the Firmament, they appear greatest to us: those Works of ours are greatest in the sight of God that are greatest in the sight of men, that are most beneficial, most exemplary, and conduce most to the moving of others to glorifie God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:36907:5"/>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 26. In other passages of the Creation we find a kind of commanding Dialect with a <hi>Fiat lux,</hi> and a <hi>producat terra,</hi> let there be light, let the earth bring forth; but in this of <hi>Adam</hi> we meet with words more particular of deliberation and advice, <hi>Let us make man.</hi> Man a Creature of those exquisite dimensions for matter of body, of these su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural endowments of Soul, that now omnipotency bethinks it self, and will consult; the privy counsel of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost is required to the moulding and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of this glorious peece; no doubt something of wonder was in projecting when a compleat Deity was thus studying its perfection; something that should border upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlastingness, when the finger of God was so choicely industrious: and loe what it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, Man the master-peece of his design and workmanship, the great miracle and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Nature, the abstract, and model, and brief story of the Universe, the Analysis and Resolution of the greater world into the less, having little to divide him from a Deity, but that one part of him was mortal, and that not created so, but occasioned, miserably occasion'd by disobedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 27. When God had created all the other <hi>species</hi> of the Creation, it is still said as the complement and perfection of each, <hi>And God saw that it was good;</hi> but here when Man was created, there is no such Eulogy, no such acclamation; and why? because there is no Creature but Man, that degenerates willingly from his natural dignity: these degrees of goodness which God imprinted in them at first, they preserve still: as God saw they were good then, so he may see they are good still; they have kept their Talent, they have neither bought nor sold, they have not gain'd nor lost; they are not departed from their Native and Natural dignity by any thing that they have done: but of Man it seems God was distrustful from the beginning; he did not pronounce upon Mans Creation (as he did upon the other Creatures) that he was good; because his goodness was a contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent thing, and consisted in the future use of his free-will.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 28. In the former Verse it is said, that God created them Male and Female, not both Male, nor both Female, but one Male, the other Female, as if purposely for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Children; and therefore when he had created them so, he said unto them in this Verse, <hi>Encrease and multiply,</hi> bring forth Children as other Creatures bring forth their Kinde. Nor was this all the blessing bestowed upon Man at his Creation, but God hath here also joyned Man in Commission with himself in the word, <hi>Dominamini,</hi> when he gave Man power to possess the Earth, and subdue the Creatures, and exercise soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and dominion over them. And further, God hath made Man so equal to himself, as not only to have a soul endless and immortal as God himself, but to have a body that shall put on incorruption and immortality too, which he hath given to none of the Angels; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that Man is higher than the Angels, who want that glory that he shall have in his body.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. AS when Man was nothing but Earth, nothing but a body, he lay flat upon the Earth, his mouth kiss'd the Earth, his hands embraced, his eyes respected the Earth, and then God breath'd the breath of Life into him, and that rais'd him so far from the Earth, as that only one part of his body (the soles of his feet) touches it, nd yet Man so rais'd by God, by Sin fell lower to the Earth again than before, from the face of the Earth, to the Womb, to the Bowels, to the Grave; so God finding the whole Man as low as he found <hi>Adams</hi> body, then fallen in <hi>Original Sin,</hi> yet erects us by a new breath of Life in the Sacrament of Baptisme, and yet we fall lower than before we were rais'd, from Original into Actual, into Habitual Sins, so low as that we think we need not a Resurrection; and this is a wonderful, this is a fearful Fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. Every Earth was not fit for <hi>Adam,</hi> but a Garden, a Paradice: what excellent pleasures and rare varieties have men found in Gardens planted by the hands of men? and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36907:6"/>
yet all the World of men cannot make one twigg, or leaf, or spire of grass: when he that made the matter undertakes the fashion, how must it needs be beyond our capacity excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent? No Herb, no Tree, no Flower was wanting there that might be for ornament or use, whether for sight, or for sent, or for taste: the bounty of God wrought further than to necessity, even to comfort and recreation. Why are we niggardly to our selves when God is liberal? but for all this, if God had not there convers'd with man, no abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance could have made him blessed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. The Tree of Life was a real Tree in Paradice, but it was not able to give im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality: for no corruptible food can make the body incorruptible; and if it could have given immortality, it must have had a power to preserve from Sin, for by sinning Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came mortal; therefore it was called, <hi>The Tree of Life,</hi> not <hi>effectivè,</hi> but <hi>significativè,</hi> as a signe of true immortality which <hi>Adam</hi> should have received of God if he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in obedience; and so also was that other Tree call'd, <hi>The Tree of Knowledge, of Good and Evil,</hi> not because it gave Knowledge, but was a Seal unto them of their misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Knowledge which they should get by the experience of their Transgression, which is call'd, a <hi>Practical Knowledge.</hi> And yet here by the way, though God forbad Man to eat of the Tree of Knowledge, yet not of the Tree of Life, to shew that he desired we should be Saints, not Rabbies and Doctors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. That which was mans Store-house was also his Work-house, his pleasure was his task: Paradice serv'd not only to feed his sences, but to exercise his hands. If happiness had consisted in doing nothing, man had not been imployed; all his delights could not have made him happy in an idle life; Man therefore is no sooner made than he is set to work: neither greatness nor perfection can priviledg a folded hand; he must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour because he was happy; how much more we that we may be so? this first labour of his was as without necessity, so without pains, without weariness; how much more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully we go about our businesses, so much nearer we come to our Paradice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. Here is a double comfort from these words to the Children of God; the first consists in this, in that it was the Lord of Life that first named death, <hi>Morte morieris,</hi> saith God, <hi>thou shalt dye the death.</hi> I do the less fear and abhor Death, because I find it in his mouth; even a Malediction hath a sweetness iu Gods mouth: for there is a blessing wrapt up in it, a Mercy in every Correction, a Resurrection upon every Death; from whence issues the other spiritual comfort, that as God did cast upon the unrepentant sinner two Deaths in the Text, <hi>a temporal,</hi> and <hi>a Spiritual Death;</hi> so hath he breath'd into us two lives: for so as the word for Death is doubled, <hi>Morte morieris, thou shalt dye the Death,</hi> so the word for Life is expressed in the plural at the seventh Verse of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Chaim, vitarum,</hi> God breathed into his Nostrils the breath of Lives of divers lives: though our Natural life were no life but a continual dying, yet we have two Lives besides that, an eternal life reserved for Heaven, but yet an Heavenly Life too a spiritual Life even in this World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. One cause of Marriage is to avoid the inconvenience of Solitariness, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in these words, <hi>It is not good for Man to be alone:</hi> as if he had said, this Life would be miserable &amp; irksome to Man, if the Lord had not given him a Wife to bear a share in his troubles and afflictions. Now if it be not good for Man to be alone, then is it good for him to have a Companion; and therefore as God created a pair of all other Kinds, so also of this. And this was that help in the Text; in which we see that God did provide an help for Man before he saw his own want, and while <hi>Adam</hi> slept and thought nothing, God was working and laying out for his good, and preparing him an Helper. Shewing that Man is stronger by his Wife: for as God hath knit the bones and sinews together for the strengthning of Mans body, so hath he knit Man and Woman together for the strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their Life, because two are firmer than one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. As <hi>Adam</hi> gave every Creature the Name according as he saw the Nature thereof to be; so God gives every man reward or punishment, the Name of a Saint or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in his purpose, as he sees him a good or a bad user of his graces. When I shal come to the sight of the Book of Life, and the Records of Heaven; amongst the Reprobate I shall never see the Name of <hi>Cain</hi> alone, but <hi>Cain</hi> with his addition, <hi>Cain</hi> that kil'd his Brother; not <hi>Iuda's</hi> Name alone, but <hi>Iudas</hi> with his addition, <hi>Iudas</hi> that betrayed his

Master. God did not begin with a <hi>Morte moriendum,</hi> some Body must dye, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wil make some Body to kill; but God came to a <hi>Morte morieris,</hi> yet thou art alive, and maist live, but if thou wilt rebel thou must dye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. This Sleep that man was cast into while his Wife was created, doth teach us that our Affections, our Lusts and Concupiscences should sleep while we go about this Action, the choice of a Wife; for as the Man slept while his Wife wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. Woman was not made of the head, and therefore must not be the head, nor yet of the foot of man, and therefore must not be set at his foot; but the man must set her at his heart, near the place from whence she came. She which should lie in his bosome, was made in his bosom, &amp; should be as close to him as the <hi>Rib</hi> of which she was fashion'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 25. Comparatively, <hi>Adam</hi> was better than all the world beside, and yet we find no act of pride in <hi>Adam</hi> when he was alone. When there was none in the world but himself and his Wife, who was not another, but himself, though they were both naked, they were neither of them asham'd. Soliture is not the scene of pride; the danger of pride is in company when we meet to look upon one another. Thus in <hi>Eve,</hi> her first act was an act of Pride, a harkening to that voice of the Serpent, <hi>Ye shall be as gods.</hi> As soon as there were more than themselves there was pride. How many have we known that have been content all the week at home alone with their worky-day-faces as well as with their worky-day-cloaths, and yet on <hi>Sundaies</hi> when they come to Church and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in company, will mend both, their faces as well as their cloaths.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. THE first Sin that ever was, was an ascending, a climing too high. When the purest understandings of all the Angels fel by their ascending; when <hi>Lucifer</hi> was tumbled down by his <hi>Similis ero altissimo, I will be like the most high;</hi> then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil tryed upon them, who were next to the Angels in dignity, upon man how that clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring would work upon him, he presents to man the same ladder, he infuses into man the same ambition; and as he fell with a <hi>Similis ero altissimo, I will be like the most high,</hi> so he overthrew man with an <hi>Eritis sicut Dii, ye shall be like gods.</hi> It seems this Fall hath broke the neck of mans ambition, and now we dare not be so like God as we should be; ever since this Fall man is so far from affecting higher places than his Nature is capable of, that he is still groveling on the ground; and participates and imitates, and expresses more of the nature of the beast, than his own. Fond man that is thus cheated of an assurance of Immortality, by a false perswasion that he shall be immortal: this <hi>Eritis sicut dii</hi> hath damn'd all. The Serpent perswades him if he does but taste, he shall be as God, when he hath tasted finds himself worse than a man, a very beast; being thus at once fool'd out of his Everlastingness, and the favour of his Maker.</p>

Till man had sinn'd his eyes wereshut, but afterwards he sees the greatness of his sin as <hi>David</hi> did; and yet for all this he was more ashamed of his nakedness than of his sin: and therefore he endeavours by figg-leav'd aprons to cover his nakedness; but we read of no preparation that was made to hide and take away the deformity of his sin: Thus many fear more to offend because of publick shame, than for any conscience of sin, as <hi>Cain</hi> rather grieved that he was made a vagabond, than that he kill'd his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

How would he that were come abroad at midnight to do a mischief sneak away if he saw the Watch? what a damp must it necessarily cast upon any sinner in the nearest approach of his sin if he can see God. See him before thou sinnest, then he looks lovingly: after the sin, remember how <hi>Adam</hi> would have sain hid himself from God: he that goes one step out of Gods sight is loath to come into it again. That therefore thou

maist begin thy Heaven here, put thy self in the sight of God, put God in thy sight in every particular action. In all our senses, in all our faculties we may see God if we will; and therefore Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Twentieth Chapter <hi>de moribus Ecclesiae,</hi> hath colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted places of Scripture where every one of our sences is called a seeing; there is a <hi>Gustate &amp; videte,</hi> and <hi>audite,</hi> and <hi>palpate,</hi> tasting, and hearing, and feeling, and all to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose are call'd seeing.

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. Wherefore is it, may some ask, that the Word of God more than any other Book doth still speak in this singular person, and in this familiar person, still <hi>tu,</hi> and <hi>tibi,</hi> and <hi>te, Who told thee?</hi> and <hi>hast thou eaten?</hi> and so in other places, thou must love God, God speaks to thee. Surely the Scripture phrase is as ceremonial, and as observant of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance as any, and yet full of this familiar word to, thou, and thine. You are to know then, that in the Scripture God either speaks to the Church his Spouse, and to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and so he may be bold and familiar with them; or else he speaks so as that he would be thought by thee to speak singularly to thy Soul in particular: and therefore when thou hearest his mercies distributed in that particular, and that familiar phrase Thou and Thee, and thou knowest not whether he speak to any other in the Congregation or no, be sure that he speaks to thee: but if thou canst not find that he means thee, but thinkest that he speaks rather to some other whose Faith and good Life thou preferrest before thine own; Do but begin to think now of the blessedness of that man to whom thou thinkest he speaks, and say to God with thy Saviour, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken me;</hi> why art thou gone to the other side: or why to the next on my right or my left hand, and left out me? why speakest thou not comfortably to my Soul? and he will leave the ninety nine for thee, and thou shalt find such a weight and burthen, and load of his love upon thee, as thou shalt be fain almost to say with <hi>Peter, Exi a me Domine, O Lord go farther from me, i. e.</hi> thou shalt see such an obligation of mercy laid upon thee as puts thee beyond all possibility of comprehension, much more of retribution, or of due and competent Thanks-giving.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. When <hi>Adam</hi> said by way of alienation, and transferring his fault, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom thou gavest me, and the Woman said, <hi>The Serpent deceived me:</hi> God took this by way of information to find out the principal, but not by way of extenuation or alleviation of their faults. Every <hi>Adam</hi> eats with as much sweat of his brows, and every <hi>Eve</hi> brings forth her children with as much pain in her Travail as if there had been no Serpent in the case. If a man sin against God, who shall plead for him? if a man lay his sins upon the Serpent, upon the Devil it is no plea, but if he lay them upon God, it is blasphemy.</p>

Here was a heavy war denounced in this <hi>Inimicitias ponam,</hi> when God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a war between the Devil and us: for if we could consider God to stand Neutral in that war, and meddle with neither side, yet were we nigh a desperate case, to be put to <hi>fight against powers, and principalities,</hi> against the <hi>Devil:</hi> how much more when God the Lord of Hosts is the Lord of that Host too? when God presses the Devil, and makes the Devil his Souldier to fight his battels, and directs his arrows and his bullets, and makes his approaches and attempts effectual upon us. It is a strange war where there are not two sides, and yet that is our case: for God useth the Devil against us, and the Devil useth us against one another, nay he useth every one of us against our selves; so that God, and the Devil, and we are all in one Army, and all for our destruction.</p>

O envy the corrosive of all ill minds, and the root of all desperate actions; the same cause that moved Satan to tempt the first man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy himself and his posterity, the same moves the Second man to destroy the Third. It should have been <hi>Cain's</hi> joy to see his Brother accepted; it should have been his sorrow to see that himself had deserved a rejection; his Brothers example should have excited and directed him: could <hi>Abel</hi> have stayed Gods fire from descending? or should he (if he could) reject Gods acceptation, and displease his Maker to content a Brother? was <hi>Cain</hi> ever the farther from a blessing because his Brother obtain'd mercy? How proud and foolish is malice, which grows thus mad for no other cause, but because God or <hi>Abel</hi> is not less good?

Who can wonder at dissentions amongst thousands of Brethren, thousands of Christians, when he sees so deadly opposition between two, and these the first roots of Brother-hood? who can hope to live plausibly and securely among so many <hi>Cains,</hi> when he sees one <hi>Cain</hi> the death of one <hi>Abel?</hi>

No sooner doth <hi>Abels</hi> blood speak to God, than God speaks to <hi>Cain:</hi> there is no wicked man to whom God speaks not, if not to his ear, yet to his heart: what speech was this? not an accusation, yet such an enquiry as would infer an accusation. God loves to have a sinner accuse himself, and therefore hath he set his Deputy in the breast of man: neither doth God love this more then nature abhors it: <hi>Cain</hi> answers stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly, the very name of <hi>Abel</hi> wounds him no less then his hand had wounded <hi>Abel.</hi> Consciences that are without remorse are not without horror: wickedness makes men desperate, the murtherer is angry with God, as of late for accepting his Brothers oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so now for listning to his blood.</p>

Thus when <hi>Cain</hi> had trespass'd against God himself in this, that he would bind God to an acceptation of his Sacrifice, God comes no farther for that, then to, Why dost thou thus? but in his murther committed upon his Brother (who was a child of God) God proceeds so much farther as to say, <hi>Here now art thou cursed from the Earth.</hi> When <hi>Ieroboam</hi> suffered idolatry, God let him alone, that concerned but God himself, but when <hi>Ieroboam</hi> stretched forth his hand to lay hold on the Prophet, his hand withered.</p>

How great a madness is it to complain too late? he that would not keep his Brother, is cast out from the protection of God; he that feared not to kill his Brother, fears now that whosoever meets him will kill him; the troubled conscience projecteth fearful things, and sin makes even cruel men cowardly. How bitter is the end of sin, yea without end; still <hi>Cain</hi> finds that he had kill'd himself more then his Brother.

For otherwise how could <hi>Cain</hi> go out from God who was every where: so that this presence of the Lord signifies a peculiar place dedicated to God; as the Ark, the Temple were usually call'd in Scripture, <hi>The face of the Lord, Psalm 43. Exod. 23. So Ionas fled from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord, i. e.</hi> from the place where the Lord had spoken to him. This then should strike a terror into Christians, and cause them to live in the fear of God, and in an awful respect of his Ministers, who have the power delegated to them from God to drive obstinate sinners from his presence, and are as that Angel with a flaming Sword to keep them out of Paradice, and deprive them of the joyes and blessedness of the life to come.</p>

If the author, the inventor of any thing useful for this life be called the Father of that invention by the Holy Ghost himself, as here <hi>Iabal</hi> was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of such as dwelt in Tents; and <hi>Tabal</hi> his Brother the Father of Musick; how absolutely is God our Father, who invented us, made us, found us out in the depth and darknesse of nothing at all? he is Father, and Father of Lights, of all kinds of Lights. He is <hi>Lux lucisica,</hi> (as <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> expresses it) the Light from which all the Lights which we have of Nature, or Grace, or Glory have their emanation.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. THe Soul of man as it came from God, so it is like God: as he, so it, is one immaterial, immortal, understanding Spirit, distinguish'd into three pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which all make up one spirit. So thou the wise Creator of all things wouldest have some things to resemble their Creator; the other creatures are all body, man is body and spirit; the Angels are all spirit, not without a spiritual composition; thou art alone after thine own manner Simple, Glorious, Infinite. No creature can be like thee in thy proper being, because it is a creature. How should our finite weak compounded nature give any perfect resemblance of thine? yet of all visible creatures, thou vouchsafest man the nearest correspondence to thee; not so much in the natural Faculties, as in those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Graces wherewith thou beautifiest his soul; how then should our Souls rise up to thee, and fix themselves in their thoughts upon thee? how should they long to return back to the Fountain of their Being, and author of their being glorious; that so we may redeem what we have lost, recover in thee what we have lost in our selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 3. Adam</hi> begetting a Son in his own likeness, is not to be understood in the shape and image of his body; but hereby is signified that original corruption which is descended unto <hi>Adams</hi> posterity by natural propagation, which is express'd in the birth of <hi>Seth,</hi> because it might appear that even the Righteous Seed by nature are subject to this depravation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. In that <hi>Enoch</hi> first walk'd with God on earth, before he walk'd with him in Heaven, is shewed, that we must first seek Gods glory on earth, before we can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into his Everlasting glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 24. If you will sit at the right hand of God hereafter, you must walk with God here: so <hi>Abraham,</hi> so <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, and God took him. God knows, God takes not every man that dies: God saies to the rich secure man, <hi>This night they shall fetch away thy soul,</hi> but he does not tell him who; that therefore you may be no strangers to God then, see him now, and remember that his last Judgement is express'd in that word, <hi>Nescio vos, I know you not:</hi> not to be known by God is damnation; and God knows no man hereafter, with whom he was not acquainted here.</p>

                  <hi>Verse 32. Sem</hi> is here first named, though <hi>Iaphet</hi> was first born, as being first in dignity, though not in birth; because from him, and not from <hi>Iaphet</hi> our blessed Saviour descended in a direct line. Now any relation to Christ enableth either place or person. For let the person be never so mean if God please to claim an interest in him, a poor Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man upon his Embassie is more honourable then the Embassador of the greatest Monarch in the world: and so likewise for any place in the world, be it never so mean and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, yet if God please to send his Ministers to preach the Gospel, and the power thereof, in such places they become glorious to the whole world. Thus it was not the great circumference and populousness of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> but the preaching of <hi>Ionah</hi> there that made it known to after-ages, nor was it the City, but the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the presence of Christ in that Temple that made it the glory of the whole earth. It is the Christian Religion only whose Fame shall last for ever, that is able to make both Men and Towns as famous and as eternal as it self.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. THe world was grown so foul with sin, that God saw it was time to wash it with a floud; if there had not been so deep a deluge of sin, there had been none of the waters; from whence then was this superfluity of iniquity? whence, but from the unequal yoak with Infidels? these marriages did not beget men so much as wickedness; from hence religious Husbands both lost their piety, and gained a rebellious and godlesse generation. Thus that which was the first occasion of sin, was the occasion of the increase of sin: a Woman seduced <hi>Adam,</hi> Women betray the Sons of God; the beauty of the Apple betrayed the Woman, the beauty of these Women betrayed this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Seed: <hi>Eve</hi> saw and lusted, so did they, this also was a forbidden Fruit; they lusted, tasted, sinned, dyed; the most sins begin at the eyes, by them commonly Satan creeps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart; that Soul can never be at safety that hath not covenanted with his eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. It is meant that God would no longer strive with them, in reproving and admonishing them, which they regarded not; but if they amended not in short time, within the set space, he would certainly destroy them, and therefore it was supposed that the Ark was a building 120 years, to the end they might repent: enough to justifie Gods mercy in forbearing, and his Justice in executing his Judgements upon sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. Man is every Creature; as 'tis said here, all flesh hath corrupted his ways upon the earth, though this corruption were but in man, and other Creatures were flesh as well as man: but man is every creature, because as <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>Omnis creaturae dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentia in homine, all the properties and qualities of all other creatures, how remote and distant, how contrary soever in themselves, yet they all meet in man.</hi> In man if he be a flatterer, you shall find the grovelling and crawling of the Snake; and in man if he be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, you shall find the high flight and piercing of the Eagle; in a voluptuous sensual man you shall find the earthliness of the Hogg; and in a licentious man the intemperance and distemper of the Goat; ever lustful, and ever in a Feaver; ever in sickness contracted by that sin, and yet ever in a desire to proceed in that sin: and thus man is every creature, and all flesh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. That God might approve his mercies to the very wicked, he gives them 120 years respite of repenting, <hi>verse</hi> 3. and here in this verse he gives them a faithful Teacher. It is an happy thing when he that teacheth others is righteous: <hi>Noahs</hi> hand taught them as much as his tongue, his business in building the Ark was a real Sermon to the world, wherein at once were taught Mercy and Life to the Believer, and to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious destruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. Doubtless more hands went to this work of making the Ark than <hi>Noah</hi> and his Children, and yet none were saved but they; many a one wrought upon the Ark which yet was not saved in the Ark; our outward works cannot save us without Faith; we may help to save others, and perish our selves: what a wonder of mercy is this that we here see! one poor Family call'd out of a world, and as it were eight grains of Corn fann'd from a whole Barnful of Chaff: one hypocrite was saved with the rest for <hi>Noahs</hi> sake; not one righteous man was swept away for company: for these few was the earth preserved still under the waters; and all kind of Creatures upon the waters, which else had been all destroyed. Still the world stands for their sakes for whom it was preserved; else fire should consume that which could not be cleansed by water.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. THe unclean Beasts God would have to live, the clean to multiply: and therefore he sends to <hi>Noah</hi> seven of the clean, and of the unclean two: he knew the one would annoy man with their multitude, the other would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich him; those things are worthy of most respect, which are of most use. But why seven? Surely that God that Created seven dayes in the Week, and made one for himself, did here preserve of seven clean Beasts, one for himself for Sacrifice: he gives us Six for One in earthly things, that in spiritual we should be all for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. This difference is strange: I see the savagest of all Creatures, Lions, Tygers, Bears, by an instinct from God, come to seek the Ark, (as we see Swine fore-seeing a storm, run home crying for shelter) men I see not; Reason once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd, is worse than bruitishness: God hath use even of these fierce and cruel Beasts, and glory by them. Even they being Created for man, must live by him, though to his punishment: How gently do they offer and submit themselves to their Preserver? renewing that obeysance to this Repairer of the World, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sin yielded to him that first stored the World. And thus these savage Creatures went in saith the rext to <hi>Noah,</hi> not to prey, but fawn upon him. He that shut them into the Ark when they were entred, shut their mouths also while they did enter. The Lions fawn upon <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Daniel:</hi> what heart cannot the Maker of them mollifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. By this is shewen the Lords patience: for <hi>Noah</hi> is warned seven dayes before of the Flouds coming, that by his preparation and entrance, others might be warned: and whereas God might have destroyed the World at once, it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing forty dayes, that the World seeing every day some perish, might at length have turned to God. And the same was <hi>Ninevehs</hi> case, <hi>yet forty dayes and</hi> Nineveh <hi>shall be destroyed.</hi> Our God is a gracious, merciful, and long-suffering God; and never strikes but he gives warning, that sinners may prevent the blow, by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Contrition. Before <hi>Nineveh</hi> shall be destroyed, a Prophet must be sent to give notice of that destruction, and to teach them a way how to avoid it; and in case they should prove dull schollars, here is forty dayes given to learn the lesson. And as God dealt with this great City, and with the whole World before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, to fore-warn them of his judgements and their own ruine; so deals he likewise with particular men: to some he gives forty dayes, to others forty months; nay, forty years to repent in; even a whole life time is to some men but a continued warning of their final destruction; and yet they like the old World, never beleeve it till they feel it, mock and jear at a Deluge until they are over-whelm'd with the Floud, and perish in their own presumptuous imaginations. So hard a thing it is to perswade sinners to beleeve that God is so just, or his Judgements so infallible, or their sins so destructive, until the Floud come, and a second Deluge, a Deluge of Fire sweeps them away, as that first of Waters did their unbeleeving fore-fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. It agrees with the nature of God who is goodness, That as all the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of Heaven were opened, and so came the Floud over all, so there should be <hi>diluvium spiritus,</hi> a flowing out of the holy Ghost upon all; as he promises, <hi>Effundam, I will pour it out upon all;</hi> and <hi>diluvium gentium,</hi> that all Nations shall flow up unto him. For this spirit, <hi>spirat ubi vnlt,</hi> breaths where it pleaseth him; and though a natural Wind cannot blow East and West, North and South together, this spirit at once breaths upon the most contrary dispositions, upon the presuming, and upon the dispairing sinner; and in an instant can denizon and naturalize that soul that was an Alien to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36907:10"/>
empale and in-lay that soul that was bred upon the Common among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, transform that soul which was a Goat into a Sheep, unite that soul which was a lost Sheep to the Fold again, shine upon that soul that sits in darkness and the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, and so melt and pour out that soul that yet understands nothing of the divine nature, nor of the Spirit of God, that it shall become partaker of the divine nature, and be the same Spirit with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. Now that <hi>Noah</hi> and all his Guests are entred, the Ark is shut, and the windows of Heaven opened. God first provides for <hi>Noah</hi> before the Wicked are destroyed: of whom, many no doubt, when they saw the violence of the waves descending and ascending, according to <hi>Noah</hi>'s prediction, came wading middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deep unto the Ark, and importunately craved that admittance which they once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. But now as they formerly rejected God, so are they justly rejected of God. Ere Vengeance begin, Repentance is seasonable; but if Judgement be once gone out, we cry too late: while the Gospel sollicites us, the doors of the Ark are open; if we neglect the time of Grace, in vain shall we seek it with tears: God holds it no mercy to pity the obstinate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. The Faith of the Righteous cannot be so much derided, as their success is magnified: How securely doth <hi>Noah</hi> ride out this uproar of Heaven, Earth, and Waters! He hears the pouring down of the Rain about his head, the shreeking of Men, the roaring and bellowing of Beasts on both sides of him; the raging and threats of the Waves under him; he saw the miserable shifts of the distressed Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers; and in the mean time sits quietly in his dry cabbin, neither fearing nor feeling evil: he knew that he which owed the Waters would steer him, and he who shut him in, would preserve him. How happy a thing is Faith? What a quiet safety, what a Heavenly peace doth it work in the Soul in the midst of all the endeavours of evil?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. There is no doubt but very many hoping to over-run their Judgement, and climbing up to the highest Mountains, looked down upon the Waters with more hope than fear: and now when they see their Hills become Islands, they get up into the tallest Trees; where with paleness and horror, at once, they look for death, and study to avoid it; whom the Waves over-take at last half-dead with famine, and half with fear. So now from the tops of the Mountains they descry the Ark float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Waters, and behold with envie that which before they beheld with scorn. By which we may see, that he flies in vain, whom God pursues: and that there is no way to flie from his Judgements, but to flie to his Mercy by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. GOds Providence is here manifest, that watcheth not only over man, but every particular Beast likewise. Whereby man is taught to be like his Creator, and to regard the life of his Beast, <hi>Prov. 12. Xenocrates</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by <hi>Aelian lib.</hi> 13. for succouring a Sparrow that flew to him pursued by an Hawk, and after let her go, saying, <hi>Se supplicem non prodidisse,</hi> That he would not betray the very Bird that flew to him for safeguard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. Now when God had fetch'd again all the life that he had given to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Creatures, and reduced the World unto its first Form wherein Waters were over the face of the Earth, it was time for a renovation of all things to succeed this destruction. To have continued the Deluge long, had been to punish <hi>Noah</hi> that was righteous. After forty dayes therefore the Heavens cleared up, after 150 the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36907:10"/>
Waters sink down: How soon is God weary of punishing, that is never weary of blessing! Yet may not the Ark rest suddenly. If we did not stay some while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods hand, we should not know how sweet his mercy is, and how great our thankfulness should be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. God doth not reveal all things to his best servants: Behold, he that told <hi>Noah</hi> an hundred and twenty years before, what day he should go into the Ark, yet fore-tells him not now in the Ark what day the Ark should rest upon the hills, and he should go forth: <hi>Noah</hi> therefore sends out his Intelligencers, the Raven, and the Dove, whose wings in that vaporous aire might easily descry further than his sight: the Raven of quick scent, of gross feed, of tough constitution; no soul was so fit for discovery; the likeliest things alwayes succeed not. He neither will venture far into that solitary world for fear of want, nor yet come into the Ark for love of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but hovers about in uncertainties. How many carnal minds fly out of the Ark of Gods Church, and embrace the present world: rather chusing to feed upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoury Carkasses of sinful pleasures, than to be restrain'd within the strait lists of Christian obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. How exactly doth the Soul of every man resemble this Dove? That poor innocent Creature after it was exposed to the wide World, was in perpetual motion, no rest to be found until it returned to the Ark: And just so is the condition of every man; so long as we are in the World, so long we are in a restless condition; perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al troubles and vexations; no rest to be found until we return unto the Ark, unto the God that sent us forth: thither must we fly, or be over-whelm'd in the Deluge of the worlds vanities, and perish for ever. Mans Soul is Gods Turtle, Created for God, and therefore can find no rest but in God. It may flutter up and down in the World, fly from one trouble, from one perplexity to another, but no peace, no rest to be found until it return unto that God who commanded it forth upon his work and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; which causeth it to take up the complaint of the <hi>Psalmist, Oh that I had the wings of a Dove, then would I fly away and be at rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. The Dove is sent forth, a Fowl both swift and simple. She like a true Citizen of the Ark returns, and brings faithful notice of the continuance of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by her restless and empty return; by her Olive-leaf of the abatement. How worthy are those Messengers to be welcome which with innocence in their lives bring glad tydings of Peace and Salvation in their mouths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 16. Ambrose</hi> and some Hebrews note, That when <hi>Noah</hi> was bid to go into the Ark, he and his Sons are joyn'd together, and so his Wife and his Sons Wives likewise, <hi>chap. 6. vers.</hi> 18. but here in their coming forth, He and his Wife, his Sons and their Wives are coupled, to shew that they lived a part in the Ark, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied not together; which is most probable, though not upon this ground, but as he farther notes, <hi>Maeroris tempus er at non laetitiae,</hi> It was a time of Mourning, and not of Mirth: and for that he knew the Deluge came because of the intemperancy of the other world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. The Ark, though it was <hi>Noahs</hi> Fort against the Waters; yet it was his Prison also: he was safe in it, but pent up: he that gave him life by it, now thinks to give him liberty out of it. At this <hi>Noah</hi> rejoyces and beleeves; yet still he waits se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes more. It is not good to devour the favours of God too greedily; but to take them in that we may digest them. O strong Faith of <hi>Noah</hi> that was not weary of this delay. Some man would have so long'd for the open Air after so long close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that upon the first notice of safety he would have uncovered and voided the Ark; <hi>Noah</hi> stayes seven dayes e're he will open; and well neer two months e're he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Ark; and not then unless God that commanded to enter, had bidden him depart. There is no action good without Faith; no Faith without a word. Happy is that man which in all things (neglecting the counsels of flesh and bloud) depends upon the Commission of his Maker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. No sooner is <hi>Noah</hi> come out of the Ark but he builds an Altar: not an House to himself, but an Altar to the Lord. Our Faith will ever teach us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

God to our selves: delay'd thankfulness is not worthy acceptation; of those few Creatures that are left God must have some, they are all his: yet his goodness will have man know that it was he, for whose sake they were preserved. It was a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to those very bruit Creatures that they were saved from the Waters to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in Fire unto God: What a favour is it to men to be reserved from common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, to be sacrific'd to their Maker, and Redeemer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. God had accepted sacrifices before, but no sacrifice is call'd <hi>Odor quietis;</hi> it is not said that God smelt a favour of Rest in any sacrifice but that which <hi>Noah</hi> offered after he had been variously tossed and tumbled in the long hulling of the Ark upon the Waters; and this was a sacrifice in which God himself might rest himself. For God hath a Sabbath in the Sabbath of his Servants, a Fulness in their Fulness, a satisfaction when they are satisfied, and is well pleased when they are so: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord said, That <hi>he will not Curse the Earth again,</hi> (speaking not generally of all kind of Cursing the Earth, but only of this particular Curse by Waters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) And whereas 'tis added for a Reason, for <hi>the imagination of mans heart is evil;</hi> it is not meant that God would spare the Earth, and Beasts, because man is subject to sin, but the Promise is made specially for man: that being he is by nature subdued to sin, he is to be pitied, and not for every offence, according to his deserts, to be judged; for then the Lord should continually over-flow the world: moreover, where it is said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 6. That <hi>the Lord would destroy the World, because the imaginations of their hearts were evil:</hi> it may seem strange, that the same cause should be here urged why he would not: therefore this is here added, to shew the original of this Mercy, not to proceed from man, but Gods own favour.</p>

And therefore when God delivers this Commandment the second time to <hi>Noah</hi> for the repairation of the World, <hi>Encrease and Multiply,</hi> (which is not only in the multiplication of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but in the enlargement of Possessions too) he accompanies it with this Reason in the second <hi>vers. The fear of you, and the dread of you shall be upon all, and all are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into your hands;</hi> which Reason can have no relation to the multiplying of Children, but to the enlarging of Possessions. God planted Trees in Paradise in a good state at first, at first with ripe fruits upon them: but Gods purpose was, That even those Trees, though well then, should grow greater. God gives many men good Estates from their Parents at first, yet Gods purpose is, That they should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease those Estates. He that leaves no more than his Father left him, if the fault be in himself, shall hardly make a good account of his Stewardship to God; for he hath but kept his Talent in a Napkin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. That little fire of <hi>Noah</hi> which he kindled in the former <hi>Chapter,</hi> through the vertue of his Faith purged the World, and ascended up into those heavens from which the Waters fell, and caused a glorious Rain-bow to appear therein for his secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And here behold a new and a second rest: first God rested from making that World; now he rests from destroying it: even while we cease not to offend, he ceases from a publick revenge. His Word was enough, yet withal he gives a sign, which may speak the truth of his Promise to the very eyes of men: Thus he doth still in his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36907:11"/>
blessed Sacraments, which are as real Words to the Soul. The Rain-bow is the pledge of our safety, which even really signifies the end of a shower. And further, the Rain-bow having two special Colours in it, one <hi>Coeruleus &amp; exterior,</hi> which is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terish, is a sign the World shall not any more be drown'd; the other <hi>Rubeus,</hi> which may be a sign the World shall be consumed with Fire. Thus all the signs of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution are proper and significant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. Who would think after all the favours that God had shewn <hi>Noah,</hi> to have found this Righteous man lying Drunken in his Tent? Who would think that Wine should over-throw him that was preserved from the Waters? That he who could not be tainted with the sinful examples of the former World, should begin the example of a new sin of his own. What are we men if we be left to our selves? While God upholds us, no tentation can move us; when he leaves us, no tentation is too weak to over-throw us. Behold he, of whom God in an unclean World had said, <hi>Thee only have I found Righteous,</hi> proves now unclean when the World was purged. The Preacher of Righteousness unto the former age, the King, Priest, and Prophet unto the World renewed, is the first that renewes the sins of the World which he had reproved, and which he saw condemned for sin: Gods best Children have no fence for sins of infirmity: which of the Saints have not once done that, whereof they are ashamed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. Ungracious <hi>Cham</hi> saw his Fathers nakedness, and laughed at it: His Fathers shame should have been his, and should have begot in him a secret horror and dejection; How many graceless men make sport at the causes of their Humiliation? Twice had <hi>Noah</hi> given him life; yet neither the Name of Father, and Preserver, nor Age, nor Vertue could shield him from the contempt of his own. I fee that even Gods Ark may nourish Monsters; some filthy Toads may lie under the stones of the Temple. And further, <hi>Cham</hi> was not content only to be a witness of this filthy sight; he goes on to be a proclaimer of it. Sin doth ill in the eye, but worse in the tongue: as all sin is a work of darkness, so it should be buried in darkness. The report of sin is oft-times as ill as the Commission; for it can never be blazoned without unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness, seldom without infection: Oh the unnatural and more than <hi>Chammish</hi> Impiety of those Sons, which rejoyce to publish the nakedness of their spiritual Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, even to their enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 23. Behold here how love covereth sins; these good Sons are so far from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward to see their Fathers shame, that they go back-ward to hide it. The Cloak is laid on both their shoulders, they both go back with equal paces, and dare not so much as look back, lest they should unwillingly see the cause of their shame; and will rather adventure to stumble at their Fathers Body, than to see his nakedness. How did it grieve them to think that they who so often had come to their Father with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, must now in Reverence turn their backs upon him; and that they must now cloath him in pity, who had so often cloathed them in love! And which adds more to their duty, they covered him and said nothing. This modest sorrow is their praise, and our example: the Sins of those we love and honour we must hear of with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, fearfully and unwillingly beleeve, acknowledge with grief and shame, hide with honest excuses, and bury in silence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 25. God preserves some men in Judgement; better had it been for <hi>Cham</hi> to have perished in the Waters, than to live unto his Fathers Curse. And yet how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual a regard is here both of Piety and disobedience? Because <hi>Cham</hi> sinned against his Father, therefore he shall be plagued in his Children; <hi>Iaphet</hi> is dutiful to his Father, and finds it in his posterity. Because <hi>Cham</hi> was an ill son to his Father, therefore his sons shall be servants to his Brethren; because <hi>Iaphet</hi> set his shoulders to <hi>Shems</hi> to bear the Cloak of shame, therefore shall <hi>Iaphet</hi> dwell in the Tents of <hi>Shem,</hi> partaking with him in blessings as in duty. When we do but what we ought, yet God is thankful to us, and rewards that, which we should sin if we did not. Who could ever yet shew me a man rebelliously undutiful to his Parents that hath prospered in himself and his seed.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 27. If thy Child prove undutiful and refractory, do for him as <hi>Noah</hi> did here for <hi>Iaphet. Noah</hi> had given that son of his a great deal of good Counsel no doubt, and had perswaded him to become a lively Member of Gods Church; but knowing well to how little purpose all this would be without Gods working upon his heart, he falls to Prayer, <hi>God perswade</hi> Japhet <hi>to dwell in the Tents of</hi> Shem: As if he had said, I have advised and done my uttermost to perswade thee my Son, but all this is but lost labour, unless God put in his helping hand; now therefore, the good Lord perswade thee. Thus do thou for thy refractory Child, desire God to perswade him, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him, to turn his heart, and thou shalt see that nothing shall stand in his way, but the work shall be accomplished; if God undertake to mend thy Son, and make him good, all his ill conditions shall not hinder it.</p>

CHam</hi> is set in the midst between <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet;</hi> wherein is shadowed the condition of the Church, that ungodly persons will ever be mingled among the faithful. The purest Grain hath some Chaff mixed with it, and the purest and most sanctified Congregations, as well in Heaven as on Earth, have had their mixture of Reprobates. There was a <hi>Iudas</hi> in that glorious Synod of Apostles, and a <hi>Lucifer</hi> even in Heaven its self.

                  <hi>Verse 10. Nimrod</hi> signifies a Rebel, and <hi>Babel</hi> confusion: to intimate, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion evermore begins in Confusion, Confusion in the Church, and Confusion in the State; in the one the Lawes of God are disordered, in the other the Laws of man; <hi>Babel</hi> is still the beginning of that Kingdom where a <hi>Nimrod</hi> is the mighty man; and where a <hi>Nimrod</hi> is the mighty man, still the aim is at a Kingdom, though the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prove a Kingdom of Confusion: <hi>Nimrod</hi> will be great, though his own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness distract and confound him. And thus it fares also with every wicked man who is a rebel against God, the beginning of his Kingdom is a <hi>Babel</hi> likewise; his understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is distracted, his affections are disordered, and all his actions are out of frame, a confusion possesses both the beginning, and end of all his wayes. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose was the <hi>Psalmists</hi> Prayer against both these <hi>Nimrods; O my God, make them like unto a Wheel;</hi> let them turn round in all their actions, let them never be fixed and setled in their courses, but let a giddiness, a <hi>vertigo,</hi> pursue their Designes, and let both the beginning and end of their Kingdom prove a <hi>Babel.</hi>

It is good to write the remembrance of Gods worthy works, whether of Mercy or Justice, upon the Names of our Children, to put us in mind of those dispensations of God; for we need all helps, such is either our dulness, or forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Upon this account we of this Nation have been very zealous in conferring such Names upon our Children at their Baptism, as might put them in mind of some part of their Christian Profession; and lest our Children should be ignorant of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those Names, they have been of late years interpreted; and instead of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing our Children with the Names of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Theophilus,</hi> these latter times have re-baptized even Names as well as Children, and have Christened them <hi>Fear-God,</hi> and <hi>Love-God,</hi> and <hi>Fight a good Fight:</hi> but how these men have imitated their Names, these late years have sufficiently declared to the whole World.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. HOw fondly do men reckon without God? <hi>Come let us build:</hi> as if there had been no stop but in their own will; as if both Earth and Time had been theirs. Still do all natural men build <hi>Babel,</hi> fore-casting their own Plots so resolutely, as if there were no power to counter-mand them. <hi>Let us build a City;</hi> if they had taken God with them, it had been commendable; establishing of Societies is pleasing to him that is the God of Order: but a Tower whose top may reach to Heaven, is a shameful arrogance, an impious presumption; Who would think that we little Ants that creep upon the Earth, should think to climb up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by multiplying of Earth! But wherefore was all this? Not that they loved so much to be neighbors to heaven, as to be famous upon earth: It was not Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that was here sought, nor Safety, but Glory: Whither doth not thirst of Fame carry men whether in good or evil? One builds a Temple to <hi>Diana</hi> in hope of glory, intending it for one of the greatest Wonders of the World: Another in hope of Fame, burns it. He is a rare man that hath not some <hi>Babel</hi> of his own whereon he bestows pains and cost only to be talked of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. When God bestowed upon man his first benefit, his Making; it is exprest thus, <hi>Let us, all us, make Man.</hi> God seems to muster himself, all himself, all the Persons of the Trinity, to do what he could in favour of man. So also here when he is drawn to a necessity of executing Judgment, &amp; for his own honor &amp; consolidation of his servants, puts himself upon a revenge, he proceeds so too. When man had rebell'd, and began to fortifie in <hi>Babel,</hi> then saies God here, <hi>Let us, all us, come together, and</hi> descendamus &amp; confundamus, <hi>let us, all us, go down and confound their Language and their Fortifications.</hi> God does not give paterns, God does not accept from us acts of half Devotion, and half Charities; God does all that he can for us: And therefore when we see others in distress, whether National or Personal Calamities; whether Princes be dispossest of their National Patrimony and Inheritance; or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Persons afflicted with sickness, or penury, or banishment; let us go Gods way all the way. First, <hi>Feciamus hominem ad imaginem nostram,</hi> Let us make that man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our image, let us consider our selves in him, and make our case his: And remember how lately he was as well as we, and how soon we may be as ill as he; and then <hi>descendamus &amp; confundamus,</hi> let us, us with all the power we have, remove or slacken those Calamities that lie upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. He that taught <hi>Adam</hi> the first words, taught these Builders words that never were. One calls for Brick, the other looks him in the face and wonders what he means; and how, and why he speaks such words as were never heard; and instead thereof brings him Morter, returning him an Answer as little understood. At first, every man thinks his Fellow mocks him; but now perceiving this serious Confusion, their only Answer is silence, and ceasing. They could not come together (but must of necessity be scattered) for no man could call them to be understood; and if they had Assembled, nothing could be determined, because one could never attain to the others purpose: No, they could not have the honour of a general dismission; but each man leaves his Trowel and Station, more like a Fool than he undertook it. So commonly actions begun in glory, shut up in shame.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. All external actions depend upon the tongue; no man can know anothers mind if this be not the interpreter. Hence, as there were many tongues given to stay the building of <hi>Babel;</hi> so there were as many given to build the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> the Evangelical Church. Multiplicity of Language had not been given by the Holy Ghost for a blessing of the Church, if the World had not been before possessed with multiplicity of Languages for a punishment. Hence it is, That the building of our

                  <hi>Sion</hi> rises no faster, because our tongues are divided; happy were the Church of God, if we all spake but one Language: Whilst we differ, we can build nothing but <hi>Babel;</hi> difference of tongues caused their <hi>Babel</hi> to cease, but it builds ours.</p>

                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 1. IT was fit, That he that should be the Patern and Father of the Faithful should be throughly tryed: for in a set copy every fault is important, &amp; may prove a rule of Error. No Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> can hope to escape temptations, while he sees the bosom in which he desires to rest, so assaulted with difficulties. <hi>Abraham</hi> must leave his Country and Kindred, and live amongst strangers: the calling of God never leaves men where it finds them: The Earth is the Lords, and all places are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to the wise and faithful. If <hi>Chaldaea</hi> had not been grosly idolatrous, <hi>Abraham</hi> had not left it; no Bond must tye us to the danger of infection. But whither must he go? To a place he knew not, to men that knew not him: It is enough comfort to a good man, wheresoever he is, that he is acquainted with God; we are never out of our way while we follow the calling of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. When the wayes of a man please God, he will be gracious to his House and Posterity. God is so pleased with the Obedience of his People, that he will shew Mercy to such as belong to them. When God saw <hi>Noah</hi> righteous before him in that corrupt age and generation, he made all that belong'd to him partakers of the same deliverance with himself; saying unto him, <hi>Enter thou and all thine house into the Ark.</hi> This appeareth in the person of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God had call'd him out of his Country and from his Kindred, and had made a Covenant with him to bless him, he adds, <hi>I will also bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee:</hi> And this is but the tenor of the Covenant that God hath made with all the faithful; their Faith is available both for themselves and for others. God will be our God, and the God of our seed after us. And this is the priviledge and prerogative that the faithful have; they beleeve this merciful Promise of God themselves, and thereby entitle their Children unto it. For as a Father that purchaseth House or Land, giveth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an interest unto his Son therein; so he that layeth hold on the Promise that God hath made to all godly Parents, doth convey it unto his Children; so that albeit they want Faith by reason of their years, yet they are made partakers of Christ, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into his Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. Never any man lost by his Obedience to the highest; because <hi>Abraham</hi> yielded, God gave him the possession of <hi>Canaan:</hi> I wonder more at his Faith in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this possession, than in leaving his own. Behold <hi>Abraham</hi> takes possession for that Seed which he had not, which in nature he was not like to have, of that Land whereof he should not have one foot, wherein his Seed should not be setled of almost five hundred years after. The power of Faith can prevent time, and make future things present: If we be the true Sons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> we have already while we sojourn here on Earth, the possession of our Land of Promise: while we seek our Country, we have it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. Even <hi>Canaan</hi> here doth not afford <hi>Abraham</hi> Bread, which yet he must beleeve shall flow with Milk and Honey to his Seed: Sence must yield to Faith; wo were us if we must judge of our future estate by our present: <hi>Egypt</hi> gives Relief to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when <hi>Canaan</hi> cannot. In outward things Gods enemies may fare better than his friends. Thrice had <hi>Egypt</hi> preserved the Church of God in <hi>Abraham,</hi> in <hi>Iacob,</hi> in <hi>Christ:</hi> God oftentimes makes use of the World for the behoof of his,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36907:13"/>
though without their thanks: as contrarily he useth the wicked for scourges to his own inheritance, and burns them; because in his good they intended evil.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. Hitherto hath <hi>Sarah</hi> been <hi>Abrahams</hi> Wife, now <hi>Egypt</hi> hath made her his Sister; Fear hath turned him from an Husband to a Brother: No strength of Faith can exclude some doubtings: God hath said, <hi>I will make thee a great Nation; Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> saith, <hi>The Egyptians will kill me.</hi> He that liveth by his Faith, yet shrinketh and sinneth. How vainly shall we hope to beleeve without all fear, and to live without infirmities? Some little aspertions of unbelief cannot hinder the praise and power of Faith. <hi>Abraham beleeved, and it was imputed to him for righteousness:</hi> He that through inconsiderateness doubted twice of his own life, doubted not of the life of his Seed, even from the dead and dry Womb of <hi>Sarah;</hi> yet was it more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult that his posterity should live in <hi>Sarah,</hi> than that <hi>Sarahs</hi> Husband should live in <hi>Egypt;</hi> this was above nature, yet he beleeves it. Sometimes the Beleever sticks at easie tryalls, and yet breaks through the greatest tentations without fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. Holy <hi>Iob</hi>'s Covenant with his Eyes in the Old Testament, should be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Christians in the New; to look to his looks, to set a guard and sentinel over his Eyes: for from looking comes lusting, from a lascivious glance proceeds a lascivious act; and it is all one in Gods esteem with which part of the body we commit adultery; so that if a man lets his Eye or his Thought loose, and enjoyes the lust of either, he is an Adulterer before God. It was therefore our Saviours advice, <hi>Mat. 5. If thy right Eye offend thee, pull it out:</hi> the meaning is this, That when thou doest give check to the loose evibrations and wanton twirles of a lascivious Eye, thou dost at that very time pull out that wanton Eye from thy body, and the lustful Devil that is in that wanton Eye from thy soul. There is great reason therefore that we should set a strict watch over this Cinque-port of our bodies: Beauty is a dangerous bait, and Lust is sharp-sighted. It is not safe gazing on a fair Woman: how many have died of the wound in the Eye? No one means hath so enrich'd Hell as beautiful faces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. It is a sad case when an <hi>Egyptian</hi> shall reprove an <hi>Israelite,</hi> when a <hi>Pharaoh</hi> shall rebuke an <hi>Abraham;</hi> and therefore all Professors of Religion should so practice it, as the very Infidels, seeing their good works answer their good words, may glorifie their Father which is in heaven. For our Calling as it is most eminent, so most eyed, and worst censured by all the Infidel part of the World. If an Apostle rub but an ear of Corn on the Sabbath, 'tis breaking of the day; a heathens Motes are a Christians Beams, and a Turks indifferency is my evil; somethings being expedient in respect of the man, which are scandalous meerly for his Religion: none therefore to keep within so strict lines both for words and deeds as the Christian; for behold, saith the Apostle, <hi>We are made a gazing stock to the world, to Angels, and to men.</hi>

ALthough the Scripture tells us, That <hi>it is hard for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> yet the Scripture saith not that it is absolutely impossible: Heaven gate stands open for the Rich as well as for the Poor; for rich <hi>Abraham</hi> here, as well as for poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the Gospel: and as it is true, <hi>Blessed are the Poor, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> So it is also as true, <hi>Blessed are the Rich, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Thus <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> flew up to Heaven with the Monarchy of the whole World upon their backs. The Patriarchs also (as in this Text <hi>Abraham)</hi> with much Wealth, many holy Kings with rich Crowns and Scepters. It is not Wealth therefore as Wealth, but Sin

When the strife began between <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> the Scripture notes it as a special Memorandum here, that the <hi>Canaanite</hi> was then in the Land. Doubtless there are at this time also in our Land too many who carry <hi>Canaanitish</hi> hearts and minds, who would; no less than the old <hi>Canaanites,</hi> rejoyce and triumph in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords; saying among themselves, <hi>Aha, so would we have it:</hi> But let those that have the Spirit of <hi>Abraham,</hi> learn also the Speech and Language of <hi>Abraham;</hi> who though he was in Age, and Dignity superiour to his Nephew <hi>Lot,</hi> yet came and said unto him, <hi>I pray thee let there be no strife between me and thee, for we are Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>

It had been the duty of young <hi>Lot</hi> to offer, rather than to chuse; to yield rather than contend: Who would not here think <hi>Abraham</hi> the Nephew, and <hi>Lot</hi> the Uncle? It is no disparagement for greater persons to begin treaties of Peace: better doth it beseem every Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> to win with love, than to sway with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. <hi>Abraham</hi> yields over this right of his choice, <hi>Lot</hi> takes it.

Wealth hath made <hi>Lot</hi> not only undutiful, but covetous: he sees the goodly Plain of <hi>Iordan,</hi> the richness of the Soyl, the commodity of the Rivers, the scituation of the Cities, and now not once enquiring into the Condition of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, he is in love with <hi>Sodom.</hi> Outward appearances are deceitful guides to our judgement or affection: they are worthy to be deceived that value things as they seem. It is not long after that <hi>Lot</hi> payes dear for his rashness. He fled for quietness from his Uncle and finds War with strangers, by whom he is carried Prisoner with all his substance. That Wealth which was the cause of his former Quarrels, is made a prey to merciless Heathen; that place which his Eye covetously chose, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayes his life and goods. How many Christians whilst they have look'd at gain, have lost themselves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. Gods way of appearing unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> was like our Saviours way of appearing in the flesh to the world: until such time as there was a general Peace over the whole Earth, our Saviour would not appear amongst men; and until such time as the strife was ended betwixt <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and they two parted friendly, God did not appear unto <hi>Abraham: God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 16. Where Charity is, there is an habitation, a Temple for the Lord; and where it is not, there is a dwelling-place for the Devil: Religion is but rottenness without it, our Devotions unsavory, our Sacrifice distaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and all our front of Holiness but dross and rubbish; Therefore Christ saith, <hi>If thou bring thy Gift to the Altar, and there remembrest that thy Brother hath ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, first be reconciled with thy Brother, and then offer thy Gift.</hi> Otherwise Dissention and ill-will will over-shadow the Altar, and keep the grace of God from descending: The fountain of Love will not be laded at with uncharitable hands. <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> will be reconciled to his Brother before he builds an Altar; and <hi>Abraham</hi> must be at peace with <hi>Lot,</hi> before God gives him a visit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 15. Ever</hi> is not alwayes used for Eternity. <hi>Aristotle</hi> defines <hi>Aeternum</hi> to be <hi>Periodus durationis cujusque rei: lib. 1. de Coelo.</hi> It is diversely used in Scripture. First, for the continuance of the world, as the Rain-bow was a sign of Gods ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant; that is, so long as the world continueth. Secondly, It signifies the whole time of mans life, <hi>I will sing of thy mercies for ever,</hi> Psal. 89. 1. Thirdly, That is called Eternal whose time is not prefix'd with man, though it be with God;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36907:14"/>
as Circumcision is call'd an everlasting Covenant, because it was not to be altered by man. But here some take these words not leterally, but upon Condition; That the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> should so long be their inheritance as they obeyed God, according to <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 25. As if the Lord should say (saith <hi>Cajetan) Quam diu erit semen tuum,</hi> as long as they shall be thy Seed, I will give them this Land: therefore when they began to degenerate from <hi>Abraham,</hi> God was no longer tyed to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. TO gather Armies, and to muster men to Battel is no new sign, but an old and ancient device among the sons of men. Thus here we have mention of two Armies; the one raised by <hi>Chedor-laomer</hi> and his Confederates; the other by the Kings of <hi>Sodom</hi> &amp; <hi>Gommorrah,</hi> these rebelling, the other punishing their rebellion. Now seeing the misery of Wars hath such an ancient stamp upon it, not lately bred, but the Child of former times, say not the old dayes are better than these; grow not wanton and weary of things present, to loath the blessings we enjoy, as the manner of many is. We complain that we are fallen into evil times, we praise the dayes that are past, and consider not that in this we murmur against God, who hath made all things good, and governeth all things well. The present state of things are grievous, because present troubles are felt, and former discommodities are forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten long ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. Let us have no fellowship with evil men, or evil actions; unless we will partake with them in the punishment. It is our Christian discretion to forsake their company, lest we be taken in the net, and snared in their wayes. Many have sustain'd much danger, and endured much affliction by conversing with evil men. <hi>Lot</hi> was never more grieved, nor less secured, than when he was even in the very midst of <hi>Sodom.</hi> He made choice to dwell there, as the place where he might soonest enrich himself, but he quickly repented him of his choice. He was taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner by forreign Enemies, and was in greatest danger by violence at his own home. To communicate with the wicked is all one as if a man should throw himself into the company of Theeves. The servants of God, which are endued with those heavenly gifts, divine graces (which are the greatest treasure) have a great charge about them: It concerns them therefore to take heed, that by evil company they be not robb'd and deprived of them. We should beware of the company and conditions of men; if we count our selves happy in the league of the wicked, we are utterly lost, and are walking in the road-way that leads to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. In regard that War it's self is lawful, it follows that the stratagems of War are not unlawful. It is not against the Word of God to use subtilty and policy, to lay snares and baits to entrap and circumvent the Enemy. In all actions of War and Peace, we must deal wisely and warily. When we live in peace and quietness, it is required of us to walk not only in a lawful, but in a wise course; but much more in War, where the Enemy is watchful, the snares are subtile, and the danger greater. This appears evidently both because God commanded it, and the godly practise it. God commanded it to <hi>Ioshua</hi> in the taking of <hi>Ai, Iosh.</hi> 8. 2. and it was practised here by <hi>Abraham.</hi> True it is we are to keep promises to all, even to our enemies. We must not promise to save them, and then destroy them. Notwithstanding we are not bound to make known to them whatever we speak or do; but are to conceal our intents to the end the victory may be obtain'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. All things that are taken in a lawful War, are not lawful plunder. The
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36907:15"/>
                  <hi>Philistines</hi> when they got the victory over the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and had the spoyl of the field, yet there was an Ark amongst that spoyl which they had nothing to do with, and they had better have let it alone, than have medled with it; that did belong to the God of <hi>Israel</hi> more than to his People; and therefore when they took away that, they took Gods Judgements and Vengeance along with it, and they did return it with far greater joy and triumph than they took it away. <hi>Touch not mine anointed, saith God, and do my Prophets no harm;</hi> they are Gods, and man hath nothing to do with them. And therefore when the five Kings in this <hi>Chapter</hi> had taken away <hi>Lot,</hi> one whom God would not have touch'd, they not only lost him, but all the rest of their spoil; all the Goods were brought back again for that good mans sake. If those Kings had not made <hi>Lot</hi> their prisoner, the rest of the spoil might have been law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful prize. So pretious in Gods eyes are his Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. It is a just observation of <hi>Philo,</hi> that God only by a propriety is stiled the possessor of heaven and earth by <hi>Melchisedec</hi> in this speech of his to <hi>Abraham:</hi> We are only Tenants, and that at the Will of the Lord; at the most we have but <hi>jus ad rem non dominium in rem,</hi> a right to these earthly things, not a Lordship over them; we have only a right of favour from their proprietary and Lord in heaven, and that liable to account. Let me then charge the Rich-man that he be not high-minded and proud of that which is none of his. That which Law and Case-Divinity speaks of life, that man is not <hi>Dominus vitae suae sed custos,</hi> is as true of Wealth: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can tell him from <hi>Seneca,</hi> that he is not <hi>Dominus</hi> but <hi>Colonus,</hi> not the Lord, but the Farmer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 23. Solomon</hi> in his Proverbs tells us, that the blessing of the Lord maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it; intimating that they which grow rich, and not by Gods blessing, but by such means as God hath accursed, the Lord doth add such a deal of sorrow, and care, and vexation with it, that they were as good or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be without it. Such riches were those that <hi>Abraham</hi> rejected at the King of <hi>Sodoms</hi> hands in this <hi>verse;</hi> when he offered him Goods and spoyls enough to have enriched him and all his houshold: No, saith <hi>Abraham,</hi> I will not take so much as a thred from you: men shall never say that <hi>Abraham</hi> was made rich, and not by Gods blessing but by the King of <hi>Sodoms</hi> means; God shall make <hi>Abraham</hi> rich, or he will ever be poor. It is reported of one that was a better Lawyer than an honest man, that he should say, He that would not venture his body shall never be valiant, nor he that will not venture his soul be rich. Let them that make no reckoning of their souls venture them at their perils; but let all that desire contentment here, or heaven here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, make their Prayers to God, and say, from such kind of Riches, <hi>Good Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us.</hi>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. IT is Saint <hi>Cyrils</hi> note, That as <hi>Abraham</hi> (so long as he was in his own Country) had never God appearing to him, save only to bid him go forth; but after when he was gone forth, had frequent visions of his Maker: So while in our affections we remain here below in our Coffers, we cannot have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable assurances of the presence of God; but if we can abandon the love and trust of these earthly things in the conscience of our obedience, now God shall appear to us, and speak peace to our Souls, and never shall we find cause to repent us of the change.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. In the 13 <hi>Chapter</hi> God promised <hi>Abraham</hi> an innumerable Seed, but yet heknew not whether it should be his natural or adopted seed; now the Lord cleareth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36907:15"/>
that doubt, and telleth him it should come out of his own bowels: yet <hi>Abraham</hi> was uncertain, Whether this Seed should be by <hi>Sarah,</hi> or another, which is told <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 16. So God deals his Promises not all at once, but by degrees; by that means to cause us still to rely upon him, and continually to pray for the performance of what we expect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. Not only a fear of God must, but a terror of God may fall upon the best. When God talked with <hi>Abraham</hi> here, a horror of great darkness fell upon him saith the text. The Father of lights, and the God of all comforts present, and present in an action of mercy, and yet an horror of great darkness fell upon <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> When God talked personally and presentially with <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 13. <hi>Moses</hi> hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God. When I look upon God in those terrible judgements which he hath executed upon some men, and see that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing between me and the same judgements (for I have sinn'd the same sins, and God is the same God) I cannot look upon God in what line I will, nor take hold of God by what handle I will; he is a terrible God, I take him so; and then I cannot discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, I cannot break off this terribleness, and say, He hath been terrible to that man and there is an end of his terror, it reaches not to me. Why not to me? In me there is no merit, no shadow of merit, in God there is no change, no shadow of change. I am the same sinner, he is the same God, still the same desperate sinner, still the same terrible God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. The sins of a professing People, or Nation, are sooner ripe than the sins of the wild world: as fruit that grows more in the Sun, is concocted and comes to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity sooner: and therefore 'tis observable, that God bears longer with the world, yea, and in a sence deals more gently in their punishment. The sin of the <hi>Amorites</hi> here was long many years e're it was full ripe; but <hi>Israels</hi> was ripe in forty years; and seeing they were most look'd upon of all the people of the earth; therefore God will visit upon them all their iniquities, and that to their cost, they shall more inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively feel his wrath. How dear was <hi>Israel</hi> unto God, by how many sweet, loving, and precious appellations were they called, his Apple, his Spouse, his Treasure, his Jewels, his Darling, and yet cast out and abandoned by that God. Oh how should this Nation of ours <hi>hear and fear, and do no more so wickedly,</hi> lest God make a quick dispatch, and do as by <hi>ASIA,</hi> remove the Candle and Candlestick out of its place.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. VVHat a lively patern do I see in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> of a strong Faith, and a weak? Of strong in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and weak in <hi>Sarah;</hi> she to make God good of his word to <hi>Abraham,</hi> knowing her own barrenness, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes an <hi>Hagar;</hi> and in an ambition of Seed perswades to <hi>Polygamy. Abraham</hi> had never look'd to obtain the Promise by any other than a barren Womb, if his own Wife had not importuned him to take another: when our own apparent means fail, weak Faith is put to the shifts, and projects strange devices of her own to attain the end. She will rather conceive by another Womb than be childless. So great is the desire of Children.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. Those that are most injurious, do commonly complain most of injuries; and this both in respect of God and their Neighbour. Thus <hi>Adam</hi> when he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that grand Catholick sin in <hi>Paradise,</hi> layes the fault upon God, <hi>The Woman which thou gavest me, she perswaded me, and I did eat:</hi> God gave him the Woman as an help against temptation, and yet he upbraids God with his gift, and charges him
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36907:16"/>
with the sin, when the Devil and his own weakness were the cause: And thus <hi>Sarah</hi> in the Text complains against her Husband, when she her self had done the injury: She gave <hi>Hagar</hi> to her Husband, and yet cryes out <hi>My wrong be upon thee.</hi> The guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty seldom accuse themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. Mans extremity is Gods opportunity; and the best seed-time for his graces is when the soul is harrowed with a sense of sin, and the body is plowed up with its punishments: then did Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Prodigal think of returning to his Father, when he knew not else whether to go: and so <hi>Hagar</hi> in the Text was easily perswaded by the Angel to go back and submit to her Mistris when she was humbled by affliction. Now she was under the rod, she was ready both to hear and obey: Affliction was her best School-master.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 10. Ishmael</hi> though he were not the chosen seed, yet received a goodly temporal blessing, by which we see that these outward blessings are no signes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal election: and here we may likewise observe that before this Promise was made to her, <hi>Hagar</hi> was bid to humble her self; so we must repent ere we can have Gods favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. Affliction hath a voice: and as musick on the waters sounds farther and more harmoniously than upon the Land, so prayers joyned with tears. These if they proceed from Faith, are showers quenching the Devils Canon-shot, a second Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of the soul wherein it is rinsed a-new, nay, perfectly cured; as the tears of Vines cures the Leprosie, as the Lame were healed in the troubled Waters. Now whether <hi>Hagars</hi> grief were for sin, or for the present pressure only, I have not to say: but God is so pitiful, that he hears and helps our Affliction as he did <hi>Hagars</hi> in this Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. God presents to us the joyes of Heaven often to draw us, and as often the torments of Hell to avert us. And to this purpose <hi>Origen</hi> saith aright as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had two Sons, the one of a Bond-woman, the other of a Free, but yet both sons of <hi>Abraham:</hi> So God is served by two fears, and the latter fear the fear of future torment is not the perfect fear, but yet even that fear is the servant and instrument of God too. Who can so absolutely divest all sense, saith <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> but that when the whole City is in a combustion and commotion, or when the Ship that he is in strikes desperately and irrecoverably upon a Rock, he is otherwise affected towards God then, than when every day in a quietness and calmness of holy affections he hears a Sermon. <hi>Gehennae timor</hi> (saith the same Father) <hi>regni affert coronam,</hi> even the fear of Hell gets us Heaven.</p>

Where you may note the difference between these three expressions of the holy Ghost, to <hi>walk with God, after God, and before God.</hi> We walk with God as a sweet companion, after God as a commanding Lord, before God as an observing Judge; we walk with him as his Friends, after him as his Servants, before him as his Children; lastly, we walk with him by an humble familiarity, after him in a regular conformity, before him by a cordial integrity; and this is according to Gods rule to <hi>Abraham, Walk before me, and be perfect.</hi>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. When God talkes with us in his Word, or we talk with God in our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers we cannot be too humble; you see from this text, that <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful fell upon his face at a conference with God, and shall we that are his sons not fall upon our knees? Certainly were there never a Church standing in the world, nor so much as one stone left for a <hi>Bethel</hi> wheresoever we came to Pray we should worship; first looking up to our God and his infinitude, with <hi>Glory be to thee O Lord;</hi> then in the <hi>Publicans</hi> dejected posture reflecting upon the dust our original and our end, with <hi>Lord be merciful unto me a sinner:</hi> and indeed can we presume high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the dust when we reverence before our Maker, or do less than hide our own faces with shame, appearing before the glorious light of that countenance which we cannot see and live, and which we shall one day look upon with trembling, if not now with shame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. There is no Faith, where there is either means or hopes. Difficulties and impossibilities are the true Objects of Belief; hereupon God adds to <hi>Abrahams</hi> name that which he would fetch from his Loins, and made his Name as ample as his Posterity; never any man was a looser by beleeving; Faith is ever recompenced with Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. God hath in great mercy and goodness promised to shew grace and favour, not only to the faithful themselves, but to their seed after them; and as the mercy of God is great, so the Faith of the godly is effectual for themselves and their Children: God will be our God, and the God of our seed after us. If then we consider either the Promise of God to be merciful, or the Faith of the godly to beleeve, in both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects we may collect and gather this truth, That the love of God to the faithful shall so abound, that it shall come to their posterity, like the pretious Oyntment poured on the head of <hi>Aaron</hi> that ran down upon his beard and flowed to the border of his garments; or as the dew on <hi>Hermon</hi> and <hi>Sion,</hi> which watered the valleys which were beneath them. Now seeing that goodness hath the Promise of bringing a blessing upon the families where it is profess'd, it is required of us to profess and beleeve the Gospel, that so we may procure a blessing upon our selves and Children. The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of which bringeth utter ruine to Father and Child. So then godly Parents must have a care to bring-up their Children and Families in the true Faith and fear of the Lord, which may be a means by the blessing of God to save thy son from death, and to deliver his soul from destruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. Circumcision is a seal of the Covenant betwixt God and us, if we be in God and God in us; if we be circumcised within, if the fore-skin of our hearts be taken away, then is the outward Circumcision a seal unto our Covenant with God; otherwise it is a seal indeed, but a seal without a Bond, a seal without any stipulation betwixt God and us; we are no whit priviledged by it, no more than are the Turks who yet are circumcised: which is the reason that the Jewes at this day have no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by this Covenant, because they are uncircumcised in their hearts, that vail that fore-skin is not taken away; and that only is the circumcision which seals the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant betwixt God and us, the Gospel-circumcision, the putting off the old <hi>Adam</hi> by that circumcision of Christ; which is the work of the Spirit wrought by the Word upon the Soul of a poor sinner, whereby the corruption of his nature is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and himself received into an everlasting Covenant and Communion with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. In the first Covenant that God made with his People (as we see here) That person that would not be circumcised, that soul was cut off from the people of God; and just so in the second Covenant that God made with his people, the Covenant of the Gospel; <hi>He that is not circumcised in heart, and made new by regeneration, he shall have no part with the Saints in heaven,</hi> Joh. 3. 3. The wise man is not priviledged by his wisdom, nor the strong man by his strength; the King is not freed by his Crown and Dignity, nor the Priest by the power of his Keyes. For if any one enters himself in Covenant with God under the New Testament, and hopes for benefit by that Covenant, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed did undergo the outward Circumcision of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36907:17"/>
the body, so must he the inward Circcmcision of the heart. No Circumcision, no Son of <hi>Abraham;</hi> no Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> no Son of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 17. Abraham</hi> was old e're this Promise and hope of a Son was given; and still the older the more uncapable: Yet God makes him wait twenty five years for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. No time is long to Faith, which had learned to defer hopes without faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and irksomness. <hi>Abraham</hi> heard this news of a Son and laughed, but not as <hi>Sarah</hi> in the next <hi>Chapter,</hi> as if it were impossible. For <hi>Abraham</hi> laughs and beleeves, expects and rejoyces; he saith not, I am old and weak, <hi>Sarah</hi> is old and barren; where are the many Nations that shall come from these withered Loins? It is enough to him that God hath said it; he sees not the means, he sees the promise, he knew that God would rather raise him up seed from the very stones that he trod upon, than himself should want a large and happy issue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 23. Abraham</hi> is not content only to wait for God, but to smart for him: God bids him cut his own flesh; he willingly sacrifices this parcel of his skin and bloud to him that was the owner of all. How glad he is to carry this painful mark of the love of his Creator. How forward to seal this Covenant with his bloud betwixt God and him, not regarding the soreness of his body in comparison of the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his soul. The wound was not so grievous, as the signification was comfortable. For herein he saw that from his loins should come that blessed Seed which should purge his soul from all corruption. Well is that part of us lost, which may give assurance of the Salvation of the whole; our Faith is not yet sound, if it hath not taught us to neglect pain for God, and more to love his Sacraments than our own flesh.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. ALthough he appeared in men, yet it was God that appeared to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> though men Preach, though men remit sins, though men ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, God himself speaks, and God works, and God seals in those men. Again, remember that nothing appeared to <hi>Abrahams</hi> apprehension but men, yet Angels were in his presence: And therefore though we bind no man to beleeve necessarily that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man hath a particular Angel assisting him, yet know that ye do all that ye do in the presence of Gods Angels: and though it be in its self, and should be so to us a stronger bridle to consider that we do all in the presence of God (who sees clearer than the Angels, for he sees secret Thoughts, and can strik imediately, which they cannot do without commission from him) yet since the presence of a Magistrate, or a Preacher, or a Father, or an Husband, keeps men often from ill actions; let this prevail something with thee to that purpose, that the Angels of God are alwayes present, though thou discern them not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. And he said, <hi>My Lord:</hi> Where note, that though Christ himself were not among these Angels, yet <hi>Abraham</hi> apprehended a greater Dignity, and gave a greater respect to one than to the rest, but yet without neglecting the rest too. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thy self to such Ministers of God, and such Physitians of thy Soul, as thine own Conscience tells thee do most good upon thee; but yet let no particular affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to one, defraud another in his dues; nor impair another in his esteemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. As the Angel which came to <hi>Abraham</hi> at the Promise and Conception of <hi>Isaac,</hi> gave <hi>Abraham</hi> a further assurance of his return at <hi>Isaac</hi>'s birth, <hi>I will certainly return unto thee, and thy Wife shall have a Son:</hi> So the Lord which is with thee in the first Conception of any good purpose, returns to thee again to give thee a quickning of that blessed Child of his, and again and again to bring it forth and bring it up, to accomplish and perfect those good intentions which his Spirit by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadowing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36907:17"/>
thy Soul hath formerly begotten in it. Thus God comes to us in nature, and he returns in grace; he comes in preventing, and returns in subsequent graces; he comes in thine understanding, and returns in thy Will; he comes in rectifying thine actions, and returns in establishing habits; he comes to thee in zeal, and returns in discretion; he comes to thee in fervor, and returns in perseverence; he comes to thee in thy perigrination all the way, and returns in thy transmigration at the last gaspe. So God comes, and so he returns to his Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. In the former Chapter <hi>Abraham</hi> heard this newes and laughed; and in this Chapter <hi>Sarah</hi> hears it, and laughs too: they did not more agree in their desire, than differ in their affection; <hi>Abraham</hi> laughed for joy, <hi>Sarah</hi> for distrust: <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> laughed because he beleeved it would be so; <hi>Sarah,</hi> because she beleeved it could not be so: the same act varies in the manner of doing, and in the intention of the doer: yet <hi>Sarah</hi> laughed but within her self, and it is bewrayed. How God can find us out in secret sins! How easily did she now think, that he which could know of her inward laughter, could know of her Conception! And now she that laughed and beleeved not, beleeveth and feareth. When she hears of an impossibility to Nature she doubteth, and yet hides her diffidence; and when she must beleeve, feareth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she did distrust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 15. Sarah</hi> thinks in this <hi>verse</hi> to cover her distrust with a Lye, one sin with another. Thus any thing serves us for a cover of sin; even from a net that every man sees thorow to such a cloud of darkness, as none but the Prince of Darkness, that cast that cloud upon us, can see us in it, nor we see our selves. That we should hide lesser sins with greater, is not so strange; that in Adultery we should forget the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances in it, and the practises to come to it: but we hide greater sins with lesser, with a manifold and multiplied throng and cloud of lesser sins; all comes to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, and so we see not great sins. As for instance, Easiness of conversation in a Woman seems no great harm; adorning themselves to please those with whom they converse, is not much more; to hear them whom they are thus willing to please, praise them, and magnifie their perfections is little more than that; to allow them to sue for the possession of that they have so much praised, is not much more neither; nor will it seem much at last to give them possession of that they sue for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. God does not reward or condemne out of his Decrees, but out of our actions. Thus God sent down his Commissioners (his Angels) to <hi>Sodom,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and to inform him how things went: And thus God went down himself to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and informe himself how it stood with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> Not that God was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ignorant of any thing concerning us, but that God would prevent that danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous imagination in every man, that God should first mean to destroy him, and then to make him that he might destroy him, without having any evidence against him. God goes not out as a Fowler, that for his pleasure and recreation, or for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, or commendation would kill, and therefore seeks out game that he may kill it. God made man <hi>ad imaginem suam,</hi> to his own image: If he had made him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an inevitable and irresistable necessity of damnation, he had made him <hi>ad imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Diabolicam,</hi> to the image of the Devil, and not his own. God then accepts or condemnes man <hi>secundam allegata &amp; probata,</hi> according to the evidence that arises from us, and not according to those Records that are hid in himself. Our Actions and his Records agree; we do those things which he hath decreed, but only our doing them and not his decreeing them, hath the nature of evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 23. Draw neer to thy self as <hi>Abraham</hi> drew neer to God; and admit thine own expostulations as God did his. Let thy own Conscience tell thee not only thy open and evident rebellions against God, but even the immoralities and incivilities that thou doest towards men in scandalizing them by-thy sins; and the absurdities that thou committest against thy self in sinning against thine own reason; and the unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and consequently the treachery that thou committest against thine own body; and thou shalt see that thou hadst been not only in better peace, but in better state, and better health, and in better reputation, a better friend, and better company if thou
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36907:18"/>
hadst sinned less; because some of thy sins have been such as have violated the band of friendship, and some such as have made thy company and conversation dangerous ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for temptation, or at least for defamation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 25. So long as there lies a <hi>Certiorari</hi> from an higher Court, or an <hi>Appeal</hi> to an higher Court, the Case is not so desperate, if the Judge do not right: for there is a future Remedy to be hoped. If the whole state be incensed against me, yet I can find an escape to another Country; if all the world persecute me, yet if I be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man I have a supream Court in my self, and I am at peace in being acquitted in mine own Conscience. But God is the Judge of all the Earth, of this which I tread, and this earth which I carry about me; and when he judges me, my Conscience turns on his side, and comfesses his Judgement to be right: And therefore Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. seconds and ratifies <hi>Abrahams</hi> expostulation here; <hi>Is God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous?</hi> God forbid; how then shall God judge the World? A particular Council may err, but then a general Council may help to rectifie that particular; the King may err, but then God in whose hand the Kings heart is, can rectifie him. But if God that judges all the earth judge thee, there is no error to be assigned in his Judgement, no Appeal from God not throughly informed to God better informed; for he alwayes knows all evidence before it is given. And therefore the larger the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, and higher the Court is, the more careful ought the Judge to be of wrong Judgement; for <hi>Abrahams</hi> expostulation reaches in a measure to them; <hi>Shall not the Iudge of all (or of a great part of the earth) do right?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. THough <hi>Lot</hi> would be a guest of <hi>Sodom,</hi> yet because he would not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their sins he becomes an Host to the Angels: and indeed where could the Angels have lodged in <hi>Sodom,</hi> if not with <hi>Lot?</hi> The houses of holy men are full of these heavenly spirits when they know not; they pitch their Tents in ours, and visit us when we see not, and when we feel not, protect us. It is the honour of Gods Saints to be attended by Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. The filthy <hi>Sodomites</hi> being now flocked together, and stirred up with the fury of Envie and Lust, dare require to do that in Troopes, which to act single had been too abominable, to imagine unnatural. Continuance and society in evil, makes men outragious and impudent: it is not enough for <hi>Lot</hi> to be Witness, but he must be Bawd also; <hi>(bring forth these men, that we may know them.)</hi> Behold! even the <hi>Sodomites</hi> speak modestly, though their acts and intents be villanous. What a shame is it for those who profess purity of heart, to speak uncleanly and lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 8. Lot</hi> craves and pleads here the Lawes of Hospitality; and when he sees head-strong purposes of mischief, chooses rather to be an ill Father, than an ill Host: his intention was good, but his offer was faulty. If through his allowance the <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> had defiled his Daughters it had been his sin; if through violence they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed his Guests, it had been only theirs. There can be no warrant for us to sin lest others should sin: it is for God to prevent sins with Judgements; it is not for men to prevent a greater sin with a less: the best minds when they are troubled yield incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate motions; as Water that is violently stirred, sends up bubbles. God meant better to <hi>Lot</hi> than to suffer his weak offer to be accepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. When men are grown to that pass that they are no whit better by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and worse with admonitions, God finds it time to strik. Now <hi>Lots</hi> Guests begin to shew themselves Angels, and first deliver <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> then from <hi>Sodom:</hi> first strike them with blindness whom they will after consume with fire: how little did the <hi>Sodomites</hi> think that vengeance was so neer them! While they went groping in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36907:18"/>
the streets and cursing those whom they could not find, <hi>Lot</hi> with the Angels is in secure light, and sees them miserable, and fore-sees them burning. It is the use of God to blind and besot those whom he means to destroy: the light which they shall see shall be fiery, which shall be the beginning of an everlasting darkness and fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable. Wickedness hath but a time; the punishment of wickedness is beyond all times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. If thou beest a Child of God, Gods Spirit shall deal with thee as his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel did with <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom.</hi> He told <hi>Lot</hi> over-night that he would burn the City, and bad him prepare: God shall give thee some grudgings before he exalt thy feavor, and warn thee to consider thy state, and consult with thy spiritual Physitian: Again, the Angel call'd <hi>Lot</hi> up in the morning, and then hastned him; and when he prolong'd (saith the text) the Angel caught him and carried him forth: because though there was no co-operation in <hi>Lot,</hi> yet there were no resisting neither: God was pleased to do all with <hi>Lot</hi> for his temporal preservation, and he will do all for thee too in thy spiritual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. One would have thought that the late plundring of <hi>Sodom</hi> should have reformed that City from their sins: but wicked men grow worse with afflictions, as Water grows more cold after an heat. And as they leave not sinning, so God leaves not plaguing of them but still follows them with succession of Judgements. In how few years did <hi>Sodom</hi> forget she was spoyled and led Captive? If that wicked City had been warned by the Sword, it had scap'd the Fire; but now this Visitation hath not made Ten good men in those Five Cities. How fit was this heap for the fire which was all chaff? Only <hi>Lot</hi> vex'd his righteous Soul with the sight of their uncleanness: he vex'd his own Soul, for who bade him stay there; yet because he was vex'd, he is delivered. He escapeth their Judgement from whose sins he escaped. Even the good Angels are here made the Executioners of Gods Judgements: There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a better, or more noble act, than to do Justice upon obstinate Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. The Messengers do not only hasten <hi>Lot,</hi> but pull him by a gracious vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence out of that impure City: they thirsted at once after the vengeance upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Lots</hi> safety; they knew God could not strike <hi>Sodom</hi> till <hi>Lot</hi> were gone out; and that <hi>Lot</hi> could not be safe within those Walls. We are all naturally in <hi>Sodom;</hi> if God did not hale us out, whiles we linger, we should be condemned with the World. If God meet with a very good field, he pulls up the Weeds and lets the Corn grow; if indifferent, he lets the Corn and Weeds grow together; if very ill, he gathers the few ears of Corn, and burns the weeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. So say most men of their bosome sins; Lord, <hi>this sin is neer to flye unto;</hi> it is but in my bosome, and it is but a little one Lord; perchance but a trip of the tongue, or a wanton glance of the eye, or a lustful thought of the heart; O let me escape and abide in that sin, in that <hi>Zoar, and my soul shall live:</hi> and he saies most truly that his Soul shall live. For it is as impossible that such a one should live without his beloved sin, as it is that he should live without his Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. O the large bounty of God which reacheth not to us only, but to ours! God saves <hi>Lot</hi> for <hi>Abrahams</hi> sake, and <hi>Zoar</hi> for <hi>Lots</hi> sake: if <hi>Sodom</hi> had not been too wicked, it had escaped. Were it not for Gods dear Children that are intermix'd with the World, the world could not stand; the wicked owe their lives unto those few good, which they hate and persecute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 26. Lot</hi> at the 17 <hi>verse</hi> may not so much as look at the flame; whether for the stay of his passage, or the horror of the sight, or tryal of his Faith, or fear of commiseration. Small Precepts from God are of importance, obedience is as well tryed, and disobedience as well punished in little as in much. And therefore when <hi>Lots</hi> Wife did but turn back her head in this <hi>verse,</hi> whether in curiosity, or unbelief, or love, and compassion of the place, she is turned into a Monument of disobedience; <hi>ut praestarit fidelibus condimentum,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> that it might be a seasoning to faithful men; and teach us not to look back, not to fall off from that calling in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36907:19"/>
which we are once entered. And now what did it avail <hi>Lots</hi> Wife not to be turned into ashes in <hi>Sodom,</hi> when she is turned into a Pillar of Salt in the plain. He that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a whole City cannot save his own Wife. God cannot abide small sins in those whom he hath obliged. If we displease him, God can as well meet with us out of <hi>Sodom</hi> as in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 35. Though <hi>Lot</hi> fled from company he could not flye from sin: he who was not tainted with Uncleanness in <hi>Sodom,</hi> is overtaken with Drunkenness and Incest in a Cave. Rather than Satan shall want baits, <hi>Lots</hi> own Daughters will prove <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites:</hi> those which should have comforted, betrayed him. How little are some hearts moved with judgements! The ashes of <hi>Sodom</hi> and the pillar of Salt were not yet out of their eye, when they dare think of lying with their own Father. They knew whilst <hi>Lot</hi> was sober he could not be unchaste; Drunkenness is the way to all bestial affections and acts. Wine knows no difference either of persons or sins. By this we see likewise what a dangerous thing it is to give way to temptation, <hi>Lot</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once drunk is the more apt to fall into it again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 37. No doubt <hi>Lot</hi> was afterwards ashamed of his Incestuous seed, and now wished he had come alone out of <hi>Sodom;</hi> yet even this unnatural Bed was blessed with encrease, and one of our Saviours worthy Ancestors sprung after from this line. Gods Election is not tyed to our means; neither are blessings or Curses ever traduced. The chaste Bed of holy Parents hath often bred a Monstruous Generation; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily God hath sometimes raised an holy Seed from the Drunken Bed of Incest or Fornication. Thus will God magnifie the freedom of his own choice, and let us know that we are not born but made good.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. THe truth was here not only concealed but dissembled: as the Moon hath her specks, so the best have their blemishes: we are born men not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and as our composition is flesh and bloud, so are we subject to the temptations that are apt to arise from those principles of our Nature. A Sheep may slip into a ditch as well as a Swine; only here's the difference, the one delights in the mud, the other would fain get out of it: the righteous may fall seven times a day as well as the wicked, but then the righteous riseth as oft and repenteth of his sin; whereas the wicked lies down and continues in it. This was the second time <hi>Abraham</hi> had committed this sin, and yet still continued the Father of the faithful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. God had reproved <hi>Abimelech</hi> on <hi>Abrahams</hi> behalf, and now <hi>Abimelech</hi> reproves <hi>Abraham</hi> on Gods. God told <hi>Abimelech</hi> that he had taken another mans Wife, and <hi>Abimelech</hi> replyed, That other man had told him a Lye. It is a sad thing that Saints and Beleevers should do that for which they should justly fall under the reproof of Infidels: we should rather dazle their eyes and draw from their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences at least a testimony of our innocency, as <hi>David</hi> did from <hi>Sauls,</hi> when he said, <hi>Thou art more righteous than I my son</hi> David. The life of a Christian should be a Commentary on Christs life; <hi>Which of you can condemne me of evil,</hi> said Christ to the Jewes? and we that bear his Name should follow his steps; and so carry our selves that we may not be condemned by the world. For our profession as it is most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, so most eyed, and worst censured; none therefore to keep within so strict lines as the Christian, being one ever under monitors: for behold, saith the Apostle, <hi>We are made a gazing stock to the world, to Angels, to men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. The reward of sin is death saith the Apostle; but what kind of death? a double death saith this text, <hi>Morte morierie;</hi> thou shalt die the death, a death complicated in its self, death wrap'd in death; and what is so intricate, so intangling as death? Who ever got out of a winding-sheet? It is death aggravated by its self,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36907:19"/>
death weighed down by death; and what is so heavy as death? Who ever threw off his Grave-stone? It is multiplied by its self; and what is so infinite as death? Who ever told over the dayes of death? Let several sinners then pass this consideration through their several sins, that as <hi>Abimelech</hi> here, so they must without Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon every sin die the death; and that a double death eternal and temporary, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and spiritual death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. Adultery is called here a great sin; not only for the uncleanness and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it, but because of the punishment that follows, and sometimes overtakes whole Cities and Kingdoms for that sin in their Governors: as it would have done here had not God with-held <hi>Abimelech</hi> from that sin, <hi>verse</hi> 6. Now God keeps his Children from sinning either by instinct of his Spirit, or the instruction of his Word, or by the guiding and guard of Angels, or by diseases, as here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. Wheresoever is wickedness, there can be no fear of God; these two can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lodge under one roof; for the fear of God drives out evil, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 1. 26. As therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> here argues well from the Cause to the Effect; <hi>because the fear of God is not in this place, therefore they will kill me:</hi> So <hi>David</hi> argues back from the Effect to the Cause, <hi>they imagine wickedness on their Bed, therefore the fear of God is not before them.</hi> I would to God neither of these Arguments were demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; but our lives shew they are. For if we feared the Lord durst we dally with his Name, durst we tear it in pieces? Surely we contemne his person, whose Name we contemne. The <hi>Iewes</hi> have a conceit that the sin of that <hi>Israelite</hi> which was stoned for Blasphemy, was only this, that he named that ineffable Name <hi>Iehovah.</hi> Shall their fear keep them from once mentioning the dreadful Name of God, and shall not our fear keep us from abusing it. Durst we so boldly sin against God in the face if we feared him. Durst we mock God with a formal flourish of that which our heart tells us we are not, if we feared him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. Thus God comes as it were out of an Engine and helps his people at a pinch. <hi>Abraham</hi> had brought himself into the bryars, and could find no way out. Many a heavie heart he had no doubt for his dear Wife (who suffered by his default) and she again for him. God upon their Repentance provides graciously for them both. She is kept undefiled, he greatly enriched; and now they are both secured and dismissed with rewards and priviledges. Oh who would not serve such a God as turns our errors and evil counsels to our great good; as the <hi>Athenians</hi> believed their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess <hi>Minerva</hi> did for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 16. Abraham</hi> is said to be a veil of <hi>Sarahs</hi> eyes. First, That no man, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> Wife, should look upon her to desire her. Secondly, It put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Sarah</hi> in mind of her subjection to <hi>Abraham,</hi> whereof the veil is a sign, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10. Thirdly, <hi>Abraham</hi> was her veil, that is, her just excuse that she did this for his cause being by him perswaded: but the former Exposition is the better. For the following words the meaning is, that all this was that she might he reproved, or in all this she reproved her self: so that they seem to be the words rather of the Writer concerning <hi>Sarah,</hi> than of <hi>Abimelech</hi> to <hi>Sarah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. Barrenness is a just punishment for an Incontinent life. This may be seen in <hi>Solomon</hi> who of 300 Concubines, and 700 Wives, left but one Son <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and he not very wise to succeed him.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. VVE must rejoyce in the least Mercy, how greatly then in the greatest; our joyes take their measure by our mercies. When <hi>Sarah</hi> had a Son she said, <hi>God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear me shall laugh with me.</hi> Her mercy in receiving a Son was so great, that it would serve a whole world to make merry with. The man that had found his lost Sheep, laid it on his shoulders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, (it was a pleasant burthen to him) and when he came home he called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Friends and Neighbors, saying, <hi>Rejoyce with me.</hi> As some afflictions are so big, that all our own sorrows are not large enough to weep and mourn over them; so some blessings are so big, that they call out more than our own affections to rejoyce over them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. It is not alwayes a disparagement to be laugh'd at; the best may be laugh'd at, the just upright man is so; holiness is under disgrace among unholy men. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> telling this story reports it as a great example of unholy scorn, <hi>he that was born after the Flesh, did persecute him that was born after the Spirit, Ishmael</hi> persecuted <hi>Isaac. Moses</hi> here tells us the manner how, and the weapon wherewith. <hi>Ishmael</hi> did not lift up his hand against <hi>Isaac</hi> (as <hi>Cain</hi> did against <hi>Abel)</hi> but his tongue, <hi>he mocked him.</hi> Those greatest differences in divine Heraldry of being born after the flesh, and after the Spirit, shew where the quarrel lay: it was the spiritualness of <hi>Isaac</hi> which rendered him so obnoxious to his Carnal Brother <hi>Ishmael. Isaac</hi> was born after the Spirit; and doubtless he shewed some fruits of the Spirit, which <hi>Ishmael</hi> did not relish, and therefore mocked him. And the Apostle gives the reason, <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 10. Sarah</hi> speaks angerly concerning <hi>Ishmael, This son of the Bond-woman shall not be Heir with my son:</hi> and might not God have said as roundly concerning us, these bond-slaves of sin and Satan shall not be Heirs with my Son. But such is the goodness of our gracious God, he deals with us like the Father of the Prodigal Child: the Son feared a sharp rebuke, and the Father provided a dainty feast. And thus God not only pardons our indignities, but crowns us with mercies and loving kindness. So that we may confess ingeniously with the Prodigal Child, <hi>We are not worthy to be called thy Sons, make us as one of thy hired servants;</hi> vouchsafe us even the least measure of thy favour, and it is more than we can deserve or expect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. Let us never be ashamed to follow the counsel of such as are discreet and godly. Neither is it greatly material who they be that give us good counsel, whether our superiors, equals, or inferiors. For we must not weigh so much who is the counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, as what is the counsel. The child is somtimes made able to advise the Father, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant may somtimes see more than his Master, the Wife may sometimes give good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to her Husband; and it is no dispraise or disparagement for them to hearken to their inferiors, but they ought to receive it as a Message brought unto them from God; yea if an enemy should perswade us to that which is good, we ought to make this benefit and advantage of him, as to hearken to our own profit. <hi>Abraham</hi> accounted it no reproach or reproof unto him, to obey the Counsel of his Wife, when she perswaded him to cast out the Bond-woman and her Son; and <hi>Abraham</hi> is commanded to listen unto it; for God said unto him, <hi>In all that</hi> Sarah <hi>shall say unto thee, hear her voice.</hi> Away then with the pride and pevishness of all those that take it as a discredit unto themselves to be put in mind of their duty to others, and refuse all Counsel whereof themselves are not the Authors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. It fares with us for the most part as it did with <hi>Hagar;</hi> as long as her Bread and her Bottle held out, so long she was reasonably well content; we hear no complaint, no moan that she made; but as soon as ever these were wasted and spent,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36907:20"/>
presently she falls a crying out she was undone, she and her child must dye, there was no other hope. Thus it fares with us, as long as our means and monies hold we can be pretty well content, God Almighty seldome hears of us; but if these be exhausted and gone, we are presently out of heart: we think there is no way but one with us, we and our children must perish, there's no remedy; unless God open our eyes as he did <hi>Hagars,</hi> to see the fountaim of his goodness, that is ever at hand to supply the Poors necessities, and then we are quieted. It is an easie matter for a man to pray for his daily bread, when he hath it in his Cubbard; but when our own provisions fail us, then to rely and rest upon the provisions of God, that's the tryal of a Christians Faith. It is an easie matter to swim in a warm Bath; but he that can hold up his head in a dangerous Sea, when every Wave is ready to swallow him up, that's the tryal of a mans strength; so 'tis an easie matter to be content in a plentiful estate, where there is no want, no lack of any thing: but for a man to be cast into a Sea of Troubles, where so many wants like so many Waves come daily breaking in upon him, then to hold up his head with content and confidence in God, there's the touchstone of an undissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Faith indeed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. ALL the injunctions of God that went before were but easie tryals of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> Faith in respect of this Command; at which all the Ages of the World have stood amaz'd, not knowing whether they should more wonder at Gods injunction, or <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience: Many years had that good Patriarch waited for his <hi>Isaac,</hi> now at last he hath joyfully received him, and that with this gracious accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; <hi>In Isaac shall thy seed be call'd, and all Nations blessed.</hi> Behold the Son of his Age, the Son of his Love, the Son of his Expectation, he that might not endure a mock from his Brother, must now endure the knife of his Father; <hi>Take thine only Son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and offer him for a burnt-Offering.</hi> Never any Gold was tryed in so hot a fire; who but <hi>Abraham</hi> would not have expostulated with God? but God knew that he spake to an <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> knew that he had to do with a God: Faith had taught him not to argue, but obey. In an holy wilfulness he either forgets Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or despises her: he is sure that what God commands is good; that what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises is infallible, and therefore is careless of the means, and trusts to the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. In matters of God, whosoever consults with flesh and blood, shall never offer up his <hi>Isaac</hi> to God: there needs no Counsellor when we know God is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. Here is neither grudging, nor deliberating, nor delaying; his Faith would not suffer him so much as to be sorry for that he must do. <hi>Sarah</hi> her self may not know of Gods charge, and her Husbands purpose; lest her affection should have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her Faith: that which he must do he will do; he that hath learn'd not to regard the life of his Son, had learn'd not to regard the sorrow of his Wife. It is too much tenderness to respect the censures and constructions of others, when we have a direct word from God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. It seems this good Patriarch was to travel three whole dayes to this Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and still must <hi>Isaac</hi> be in his eyes, whom all this while he seems to see bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the pile of wood which he carries; there is nothing so miserable as to dwell under the expectation of a great evil. That misery which must be is mitigated with speed, and aggravated by delay. All this while if <hi>Abraham</hi> had repented him, he had leisure to return; there is no smal tryal even in the very time of tryal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. When <hi>Abraham</hi> went up to the great Sacrifice of his Son, he left his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and his Ass below. Though our natural reason, and humane Arts serve to carry us to the hill, to the entrance of the mysteries of Religion; yet to possess us of the hill it self, and to come to such a knowledg of the mysteries of Religion as must
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36907:21"/>
save us, we must leave our natural reason, and humane Arts at the bottom of the hill, and climb up only by the light and strength of Faith. <hi>Dimitte me quia lucescit,</hi> said that Angel that wrestled with <hi>Iacob, Let me go for it grows light.</hi> If thou think to see me by day-light, saith that Angel thou wilt be deceived. If we think to see this mysterie of the Trinity by the Light of Reason, <hi>Dimittimus,</hi> we shall loose that hold which we had before; our natural Faculties, our Reason will be perplex'd and enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and our supernatural, our Faith not strengthened that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. When they are come within sight of the chosen mountain, the Servants are dismissed; what a devotion is this that will abide no witnesses? he will not suffer two of his own vassals to see him do that which soon after all the World must know he hath done; yet is not <hi>Abraham</hi> afraid of that piety which the beholders could not see without horror, without resistance, which no ear could hear of without abomination. What stranger could have endur'd to see the Father carry the knife and fire, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that death which he had rather suffer than inflict, the Son securely carrying that burthen which must carry him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. If <hi>Abrahams</hi> heart could have known how to relent that question of his dear, innocent, and religious Son, had melted it into compassion; <hi>My Father, behold the fire and the wood, but where is the Sacrifice?</hi> I know not whether that word, <hi>My Father</hi> did not strike <hi>Abraham</hi> as deep as the knife of <hi>Abraham</hi> could strike his Son, yet doth he not so much as think (O miserable man, that may not at once be a Son to such a God, and a Father to such a Son) still he persists, and conceals, and where he meant not, prophesies; <hi>My Son, God will provide a Lamb for a burnt-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 10. Abraham</hi> here lifts up his hand to fetch the stroke of death at once, not so much asthinking by chance that God will relent after the first wound. Now the stay of <hi>Abraham</hi> the hope of the Church lies upon bleeding under the hand of a Father; what bowels can chuse but yearn at this spectacle? which of the Savagest Heathens that had been now upon the hill of <hi>Moriah,</hi> and had seen through the bushes the hand of a Father hanging over the throat of such a Son, would not have been more perplex'd in his thought, than that unexpected Sacrifice was in those briars: yet he whom it nearest concern'd is least touch'd: Faith had wrought the same in him which cruelty would in others, not to be moved. He contemns all fears, and over-looks all impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities; his heart tells him that the same hand which rais'd <hi>Isaac</hi> from the dead womb of <hi>Sarah,</hi> can raise him again from the ashes of his Sacrifice. With this confidence was the hand of <hi>Abraham</hi> now falling upon the throat of <hi>Isaac,</hi> who had given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for dead; when suddenly the Angel of God interrupts him, forbids him, commends him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. The voice of God was never so welcome, never so sweet, never so seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable as now. It was the tryal that God intended, not the fact. <hi>Isaac</hi> is sacrificed, and is yet alive: and now both of them are more happy in that they would have done, than they could have been distress'd if they had done it. Gods charges are oft-times harsh in the beginnings, and proceeding; but in the conclusion alwayes comfortable: true spiritual comforts are commonly late and sudden. God defers on purpose that our tryals may be perfect, our deliverance welcome, our recompence glorious. <hi>Isaac</hi> had never been so precious to his Father, if he had not been recovered from death, if he had not been as miraculously restored as given: <hi>Abraham</hi> had never been so blessed in his Seed, if he had not neglected <hi>Isaac</hi> for God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. The only way to find comfort in any earthly thing, is to surrender it in a faithful carelesness into the hands of God. <hi>Abraham</hi> came to Sacrifice, he may not go away with dry hands; God cannot abide that good purposes should be frustrate. Lest either <hi>Abraham</hi> should not do that for which he came, or shall want means of speedy thanks-giving for so gracious a disappointment; behold a Ram stands ready for the Sacrifice, and as it were proffers himself to this happy exchange. He that made that beast brings him thither, fastens him there. Even in small things there is a great providence; what mysteries there are in every (though the least) act of God.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. BEcause the years of <hi>Sarah</hi> are here distinctly numbred, and the Hebrews read thus, and the lives of <hi>Sarah</hi> was an hundred years, and twenty years, and seven years; the Jewish Rabbins collect, that here is commended her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and her chastity: <hi>viz.</hi> that she was as fair at an hundred years as at twenty, and as chast at twenty as at seven; but this collection of the Rabbins perchance is scarce warrantable from the words; yet from hence we may safely conclude for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that the Lord doth number all our years, and whether they be few or many, he hath set them down in his Book of Remembrance. For here <hi>Sarah's</hi> daies are pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually numbred; and <hi>Iob</hi> in his Fourteenth Chapter mentioneth moneths and daies; how that our daies are exactly determined, and the number of moneths which man hath to live are in the Lords hand. Wherefore no good man need make any question but that the Lord hath a care of him, and that his life doth not depend upon the skill of the Physitian, but the good pleasure of our God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. These words, <hi>She dyed at Hebron,</hi> bids us meditate on theformer Story. 'Tis well known that at <hi>Beersheba Abimelech</hi> made a league with <hi>Abraham;</hi> the tenure whereof was, that the one should not hurt the other. whereupon <hi>Abraham</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing he should have set up his staff there, planted a grove: yet for all this <hi>Sarah</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not there, but dieth at <hi>Hebron</hi> certain miles distant from <hi>Beersheba,</hi> and dieth in the absence of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and happily without the presence of her Son and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, dieth in a strange place among strangers: which may serve to comfort those whom the Lord will not vouchsafe to die in their own Country among their nearest and dearest Friends, wanting them to close up their dying eyes, and perform the duties and offices of love. For though Friends be absent, yet the best Friends God and his Christ are ever present to the faithful; and when all forsake, yet they never forsake, and Heaven is no further from one place than another: and then in regard we are all with <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> here liable to a wandering and a wavering condition, this should hold up in us all a longing desire of Heaven, where all joy remains and is fix'd for evermore, seeing here we have no happiness, no rest, no quietness. Here is only the vally of tears and weeping, we must look for the happy place of joy and gladness in another World, where shall be no more sorrow, nor crying, nor tears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. This <hi>Sarah</hi> that before was the desire of <hi>Abrahams</hi> eyes is now desired to be removed out of his sight; she that before had a beauty to tempt Kings, had not now so much left her by death, as to take her own Husband. I have read of a fair young <hi>German</hi> Gentleman, who living, refused to be pictured, and put off the importunity of his Friends, by giving way that after a few daies burial they might send a Painter to his Vault, and if they saw cause for it, draw the image of Death unto the Life; they did so, and found his face half eaten, his Midrife and Back-bone full of Serpents; and so he stands pictured among his armed Ancestors. Thus doth the fairest Beauty change, and it will be as bad with you and me as it was here with <hi>Sarah;</hi> and then what nearest Relation will endure our company, what Servants shall we have to wait upon us in the Grave, what officious people to cleanse away the moist cloud cast upon our faces from the sides of the weeping Vaults, which are the longest Weepers for our Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals; all our Friends will then like <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Text desire to remove us out of their sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. The eye affects the heart with sorrow-occasioning objects; if sorrow be in the eye, it will not stay long from the heart. Hence when <hi>Sarah</hi> was dead, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in this Text thus bespeaks the people among whom he dwelt, <hi>If it be in your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight.</hi> It did afflict the heart of <hi>Abraham</hi> with sorrow to see the body of his deceased Wife, or the Coffin where she lay, whom he had so entirely loved, therefore he saith, <hi>Bury her out of my sight.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. This world is but a thorow-fare: we have no place to settle to abide here, and therefore our first purchase of possession should be like this of <hi>Abrahams,</hi> a place to bury in, not to build upon: Our Grave is our long and lasting home; all our other houses are but transitory, and as short-lived as our selves. And therefore to mind us of our mortality, it were good with the Patriarch here to make our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre our first purchase. Upon this account when our first Parents had made them Garments of Figg-leaves, God gave them Garments of skins; with those they would have covered their shame, with these God did discover their mortality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. Though the pomp of Funerals concerns not the dead in real and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive purposes, yet it is the duty of the living to see their Friends fairly Interr'd. For to the Dead it is all one whether they be carried forth on a Chariot, or a wooden Beer, whether they rot upon the earth, or under the earth, whether in a Cave, or in a Ditch. There is nothing in this but opinion, and the decency of some to be served. Let thy Friend therefore be interr'd as <hi>Sarah</hi> was here after the Laws of the Country, and the dignity of the person. It was therefore that our blessed Saviour who was ever tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in his expence, was yet pleas'd to admit the cost of <hi>Maries</hi> Ointment upon his head and feet, because she did it against his Burial; by which he remark't it to be a great act of piety, and honourable to Interr our Friends according to the proportion of their condition, and so to give a testimony of our hopes of their Resurrection.</p>

                  <hi>Verse 3. ABraham</hi> would not link his Son with the wicked: he remembred what had come of such Marriages in the Age before him; when the Sons of God took them Wives of the Daughters of Men only for their Beauty, without regard of Religion or honesty. Their destruction was a lesson to him; he avoided their sin by fearing their punishment. And afterwards under the Law God gave his people express charge concerning this, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. and the reason is there given, <hi>Lest they make thy Sons go a whoring after their gods;</hi> a sufficient reason to prevail as with the Jew, so much more with the Christian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. The necessary use of seasoning and sanctifying the first entrance into the married estate, is by prayer to God. <hi>Abrahams</hi> servant being intrusted with a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that nature, commended the whole success to God by prayer; and the Woman being sent away by her Friends, was dismiss'd with a blessing upon both. Look to the first Marriage that ever was, the Lord himself knit the knot, and confirm'd it with a blessing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. and Gods course should be a pattern for the following times; and to assure us withall, that when this is left out we may well say as Christ did in another Particular concerning Marriage, <hi>From the beginning it was not so.</hi> And good reason there is for this: for Marriage is the Covenant of God, and if he be not call'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, it cannot prosper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. When <hi>Eliezer</hi> went a wooing for his young Master <hi>Isaac;</hi> the tryal by which he intended to prove a fit Wife for <hi>Isaac,</hi> was this; that if saith he, when I say to the Maid give me drink, she say again drink, and I will give thy Camels also, she without more ado should be a Wife for <hi>Isaac;</hi> that is, if she were gentle; not like the Woman <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. who when Christ asked her Water, call'd him Jew; <hi>How is it that thou being a Iew, askest water of one that is a Samaritan:</hi> for though there be many sins incident to Women, yet no vice in Women is so unwomanly as this. If <hi>Adam</hi> had been furious the matter had been less; for he was made of Earth the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Iron and Steel, those murthering mettals; but the Woman she that was made of so tender mettal to become so terrible, the weaker Vessel so strong in passion, yea to look so fair, and speak so foul, what a contrariety is this. There was great reason sure to compare a good Woman to a snail: not only for her silence, and continual keeping
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36907:22"/>
of her house, but also for a certain timorousness of her nature, which at the least sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the air shrinks back into her shell: and so ought the Wife to do if her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band but speak, to play all hid, and under hatches; and to say to her Husband as <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> to her Father, <hi>Let not my Lord be angry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 30. Laban</hi> gave this respect unto <hi>Abrahams</hi> Servant, not for his own sake, nor yet his Masters, but for the Ear-rings sake, and the Bracelets. Thus many love God for their own interest, and not his glory; in all their services they look a squint at God, but directly at self-ends; and seldom or never look at his glory but through the spectacles of self-love. Such was <hi>Iehu's Zeal</hi> serving God so far as he might serve himself, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. But this is merchandizing with God, and not obedience, to serve him for ends. I am never at the pitch of sincerity, till I see enough in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self without looking out of him, to have him as my exceeding rich reward. When it comes once to this point, that the beauties of Gods truth, and the pleasantness of his wayes, and the holiness of his will, and the equity of his Laws, are the arguments and wages that hire me to his service, then do I serve him as I ought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 39. Here the servant leaveth out the charge that was given him by <hi>Abraham</hi> in the sixt Verse of this Chapter: <hi>Beware that thou bring not my Son thither again,</hi> for this speech would have offended them; as though <hi>Abraham</hi> had counted them a forlorn and wicked people. We learn then from this discreet omission of this part of <hi>Abrahams</hi> charge, that every truth in all places, and upon all occasions is not to be uttered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 63. It is our duty to study the Heavens, and be acquainted with the Stars; in them the wonderful works of God are seen; and a sober knowledg in Nature may be an advantage unto Grace. Heaven is the most considerable of all inanimate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and more considerable than most of the animate. And therefore some of the Rabbins tell us, that when <hi>Isaac</hi> went out into the field to meditate, the subject of his meditation was the Stars, or the Heavens. It is good to take field-room sometimes, to view and contemplate the works of God round about. Only take heed of the folly of Astrological curiosities confining the providence of God to secondary causes; avoid that, and the heart may have admirable elevations unto God from the meditation of the Works of God. If the Heavens declare the glory of God, we should observe what glory that is which they declare. The Sun, Moon, and Stars are Preachers, universal Preachers, they are natural Apostles, the World is their charge, and their words saith the <hi>Ps. 19. go to the end of the earth.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 65. At the first meeting of <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecka,</hi> he was gone out to meditate in the fields, and she came riding that way with his Fathers man, who was imployed in making that Marriage; and when upon asking she knew that it was he who was to be her Husband, <hi>She took a veil and covered her face,</hi> saith that story. What free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and nearness soever they were to come to after, yet there was a modesty, and a bashfulness, and a reservedness required before; and her first kindness should be but to be seen. A man would be glad of a good countenance from her that shall be his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ask her whether she will be his or no: a man would be glad of a good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from his Prince before he intend to press him with any particular suit: and a sinner may become to his <hi>Miserere mei Domine,</hi> to desire that the Lord would think upon him, that the Lord would look gratiously towards him, that the Lord would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh him with the beams of his favour, before he have digested his devotion into a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal prayer, or entred into a particular consideration what his necessities are.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. A <hi>Braham</hi> died, saith the text, <hi>plenus dierum, full of years;</hi> it is not said so in the text of <hi>Methusalem</hi> that he died full of years, and yet he had another manner of <hi>gomer,</hi> another measure of life than <hi>Abraham:</hi> for he lived al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most eight hundred years more than he; but he that is best disposed to die, is fullest of years. One man may be fuller at twenty than another at seventy. <hi>David</hi> lived not the tythe of <hi>Methusalems</hi> years, not ten to his hundred, he lived less than <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and yet <hi>David</hi> is said to have died full of years, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. he had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self agreeable to God, and so was made ripe for him. In that therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> is said here to die in a good old age, whereas for many before him dying much elder this phrase is not used; it was not the old age of his body, but his perfection of vertue that made a good old age. Again, it is said in the Hebrew text, <hi>he was full,</hi> and no more: upon which reading, because <hi>dayes</hi> is not in the original, the Rabbies gather that he was <hi>full,</hi> not only of <hi>dayes,</hi> but of all other blessings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. Of all the Patriarcks, none made so little noise in the World as <hi>Isaac;</hi> none lived either so privately, or so innocently; neither know I whether he proved himself a better Son, or Husband. For the one, he gave himself over to the knife of his Father, and mourned three years for his Mother: For the other, he sought not to any Handmaids bed, but in a chaste forbearance reserved himself for twenty years space, and prayed: <hi>Rebecca</hi> was so long barren; his prayers proved more effectual than his seed. At last she conceives, as if she had been more than the Daughter-in-law to <hi>Sarah;</hi> whose Son was given her, not out of the power of nature, but of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. God is better to us than we would our selves: <hi>Isaac</hi> prayes for a Son, God gives him two at once: now she is no less troubled with the strife of the Children in her Womb, than before with the want of Children. We know not when we are pleased; that which we desire, oft-times discontents us more in the fruition; we are ready to complain both full and fasting. Before <hi>Rebecca</hi> conceived, she was at ease: before spiritual Regeneration there is all peace in the Soul; no sooner is the new-man form'd in us but the Flesh conflicts with the Spirit. There is no Grace where there is no Unquietness; <hi>Esau</hi> alone would not have striven; nature will ever agree with its self: never any <hi>Reb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cca</hi> conceived only an <hi>Esau;</hi> or was so happy as to conceive none but a <hi>Iacob;</hi> she must be the Mother of both that she may have both joy and exercise. This strife began early; every true <hi>Israelite</hi> begins his War with his being.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 26. So early, so primary a sin is Pride, that we see even Children strive for place and precedency; and Mothers are ready to go to the Heraulds to know how Cradles should be ranked, which Cradle shall have the first place. Nay, even in the Womb in this text there was contention for precedency; <hi>Iacob</hi> took hold of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Esaus</hi> heel, and would have been born before him. And as our Pride begins in our Cradles, so it continues in our Graves and Monuments. It was a good while in the Primitive Church before any were buried in the Church, the best contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Church-yards. But now persons whom the Devil kept from Church all their lives, <hi>Separatists</hi> and <hi>Libertines,</hi> that never came to any Church, Pride and vain-glory brings to Church after their deaths in an affectation of high Places and sumptuous Monuments in the Church; and such as have given nothing at all to any Pious Uses; or have determined their Almes and their Dole which they have given in that one day of their Funeral and no farther, have given large Annuities for new painting their Tombes, and for new Flags and Scutcheons every certain number of years.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 31. These two were the Champions of two Nations, the field was their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb; their quarrel precedency and superiority; <hi>Esau</hi> got the right of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Iacob</hi> of Grace. Yet that there might be some pretence of equality, lest <hi>Esau</hi> should out-run his Brother in the World, <hi>Iacob</hi> holds him fast by the heel; so his hand was born before the others foot. But because <hi>Esau</hi> was some minutes the elder; that the younger might have better claim to that which God had promised, he buyes that which he could not winn: if either by strife, or purchase, or suit, we can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain spiritual blessings we are happy: If <hi>Iacob</hi> had come forth first, he had not known how much he was bound to God for the favour of his advancement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 32. There was never any Meat, except the forbidden Fruit, so dear bought as this Broth of <hi>Iacobs;</hi> in both, the Receiver and the Eater is accursed. Every true son of <hi>Israel</hi> will be content to purchase spiritual favours with earthly; and that man hath in him too much of the bloud of <hi>Esau</hi> which will not rather die than forgo his birthright. Hence we may further learn, that if <hi>Esau</hi> were so much to blame to fell his birthright for a mess of Pottage, which yet was to save his life; how much more are they to blame that <hi>Ahab-</hi>like sell themselves to work wickedness; that for a title of honour, esteem of men, or for a little white and yellow dust, which is called Gold and Silver (meer vanities) will sell their souls? Alas! These ticklings will turn into stings; and the torment will be the more torment the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the sin was. 'Twill be but cold Comfort for any man to go to Hell with Credit; or that others think him gone to Heaven, when he feels him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 33. Esau</hi> sold his Birthright, and with it, as the Rabbins say, Heaven its self; whereof the birthright was a type and pledge. So <hi>Esau</hi>'s sin was in his unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for such a dignity; in limiting it to this life, in selling it so cheap; but especially in his prophane parting with a spiritual blessing for a temporal, with the food and joy of Angels for a mess of Pottage. Such a foolish bargain makes every impenitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the sale of his soul for a thing of nought; which Christ (who only knew and paid the price of a Soul) saith, is more worth than the world. Let there be no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane person among us as was <hi>Esau,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. And that there may not, let not men take pleasure in pleasure, spend too much time in it. It was not simply a sin in <hi>Esau</hi> to go a hunting; but yet the more he used the more prophane he grew by it, and came at length to contemne his birthright. God allows men to stoop to lawful delights and recreations for their bodies sake, as the Eagle to the prey, or as <hi>Gideons</hi> Souldiers to soop their handful, not swill their belly full. An honest heart is where his calling is; such a one when he is elsewhere is like a fish in the air, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto if it leap for Recreation or Necessity, yet it soon returns to his own Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 34. Esau</hi> may be as great a glutton in his Pottage as those greedy Dogs, <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 12. Thus the Poor may sin as much in their throat as the Rich; for men have <hi>talem dentem, qualem mentem,</hi> such an appetite as they have affection: there is Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curisme in course fare, as well as dainties. An <hi>Esau</hi>'s luxury is in his mind more than his taste.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. IF the <hi>Canaanites</hi> had amended by the former Famine, this latter had been prevented. For God takes no delight in the misery and affliction of his Creatures. He first tries gentle means, and if those will do no good, rigid and severe courses must be used: first he chastiseth us with Rods, and then with Scorpions: if a single Famine will not humble us, that Famine shall be doubled till we are brought low, and continued upon us so long as we continue in our sins. So that if we be destroyed,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36907:24"/>
our destruction is from our selves; and if God doth multiply his Judgements upon us, it is because that we do multiply our sins: if man be not weary of sinning, what reason is there that God should be weary of punishing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. So long as we carry flesh and blood about us, we shall be subject to such passions as arise from that flesh and blood: <hi>Moses</hi> had his anger; <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> their fear. But now these passions must be kept within their bounds, or else they run out into sin. As here <hi>Isaac's</hi> fear was too predominant, it made him as it had done his Father <hi>Abraham</hi> call his Wife his Sister, and in that to lie; which sin was greater in him than in his Father, because he was not warn'd by his Fathers example. Now the child of God should rather die than lie. <hi>Nec prodam nec mentiar,</hi> said that good Bishop in <hi>St. Augustine;</hi> and that was a brave Woman in <hi>St. Ierome,</hi> that being on the Rack, resolved and answered the tormentor, I had rather tell the truth and perish, than lie and live. The Chamelion is the most fearful of all Creatures; and doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore change into all colours to save it self: so will timerous persons. Let us therefore fortifie our hearts against this passion, that we may not fall into the sins of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 13. Isaac</hi> waxed rich because the Lord blessed him, <hi>verse</hi> 12. it is Gods blessing that maketh rich. Godliness hath the promises of both lives; now the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are the unsearchable riches of Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 9. who is the heir of all, and hath godly men his co-heirs, entailing upon them riches and honour, life, and length of daies, the blessings of both hands; and if at any time God doth deny gain to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it is that it may be admired for itsself; as having a self-sufficiency, and a hid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of its own. Agrain of Grace is worth all the gold of Ophir, and a remnant of Faith of more value than the richest Ward-Robes. Thus a Righteous man is the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est man in the World; true piety hath true plenty, and whereas the Wicked in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their sufficiency are in straits, the Godly in the fulness of their straits are in all sufficiency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 18. Origen</hi> extends this power far, though not very confidently; perchance saith he in every one of our souls there is this well of the Water of Life, and this power to have power to open it: whether our souls be intended by <hi>Origen</hi> of us as we are men, or of us as we are Christians I pronounce not; but divide it: in all us as we are natural men there is this Well of Water of Life: <hi>Abraham</hi> digg'd it at first the Father of the Faithful, our Heavenly <hi>Abraham</hi> infused it unto us at first in <hi>Adam;</hi> of whom as we have the image of God though defaced, so we have this Well of Water though stopt up: but then the Philistins having stopt this Well, Satan by sin having barr'd it up, the power of opening it again is not in the natural man; but <hi>Isaac</hi> diggs it again, <hi>Isaac</hi> who is <hi>Filius laetitiae,</hi> the Son of joy; our <hi>Isaac,</hi> our Jesus he opens this Well of Life again to all that receive him; according to his Ordinance in his Church he hath given this power of keeping open in themselves this Well of Life, these means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. When <hi>Isaac's</hi> servants had digged a first and a second Well, the Heards<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Gerar</hi> contended about it, saying, the Water is ours: then his Servants digg'd a third Well, and for that they strove not; therefore he call'd the name of it <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, i. e.</hi> room; for now saith he, the Lord hath made room for us. Thus we may say of all our comforts and mercies <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> that is, room; but of all our afflictions that they are straits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 30. In a Feast there are two things; extraordinary provision, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary company; both are lawful. God hath given us the Creature not only for neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, but for delight; and it is a clear argument that such use of the Creatures in feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is lawful, because God hath made more Creatures serving for the delight of man, than he hath made for the necessity of man. If God had meant that men should do nothing but maintain their lives, and serve their own necessity, so as they might go on in their places and callings, one half of the Creatures might have been spared; but God made nothing in vain: therefore he is willing we should use the creatures for moderate delight. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> made a great Feast at the weaning of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> here
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36907:24"/>
makes a Feast for <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Phicol</hi> the chief Captain of his Army: and the like examples we have in divers other places. And our Saviour Christ himself was at a Feast in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> where when Wine fail'd he supplied it by miracles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 31. Men may do much, and go far in the love of Gods people, and yet not love them as they ought to be loved: they may hold an outward correspondency with them in outward peace and neighbourhood; they may live quietly by them, and with them; be free from quarrels, suits, contentions, vexations, and oppositions against them, and in these respects may keep fair quarter with them, and yet for all this not love them, as Gods people are to be loved. <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Phicol</hi> desire to live pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably and quietly with <hi>Isaac,</hi> that there may be an Oath and a Covenant between them; but yet these being Heathens, could not love <hi>Isaac</hi> as a godly man should be loved; they departed from him in peace saith this verse, peace is one thing, and love is another.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. AS <hi>Isaac</hi> said here that he knew not the day of his death; so may we say both of the time, and also of the place and manner of our death. For death surprizeth some, as <hi>Abel</hi> when he was walking in the field, others as <hi>Uz</hi> when he was sitting at his door; some with <hi>Iobs</hi> children at a Feast, others with the Philistines sporting in a Theater. Thus likewise may we say of the manner of our death; there is a natural death when a man dies, as a Lamp goes out, because there is no more Oyl to feed it; and there is a violent death, when the soul is thrust out of doors, and the Lamp of Life not burnt, but blown out. <hi>Iosia</hi> dies by the hurt of an Arrow, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God by the teeth of a Lyon, <hi>Abimelech</hi> by the fall of a stone. Boast not thy self therefore of to morrow, for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth; if not an end of thy sins, it may be an end of thy life; if it bring not forth conversion, it may bring forth confusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. What hath careless <hi>Esau</hi> lost, if having sold his Birth-right, he may obtain the blessing. Or what hath <hi>Iacob</hi> gain'd if his Brothers Venison may countervail his pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Yet thus hath old <hi>Isaac</hi> decreed, who was not now more blind in his eyes than in his affections. God had forewarn'd him that the Elder should serve the Younger, yet <hi>Isaac</hi> goeth about to bless <hi>Esau.</hi> The dearest of Gods Saints have been sometimes transported with natural Affections; he saw himself prefer'd to <hi>Ismael</hi> though the Elder, he saw his Father wilfully forgetting Nature at Gods command, in binding him for Sacrifice; he saw <hi>Esau</hi> leudly matcht with Heathens, and yet he will remember nothing, but <hi>Esau</hi> is my first-born: but how gratious is God, that when we would, will not let us sin: and so orders our actions, that we do not what we would, but what we ought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. That God which had ordain'd the Lordship for the younger, will also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive for him the blessing; what he will have effected shall not want means: the mother shall rather defeat the Son, and beguile her Husband, than the Father shall beguile the chosen Son of his Blessing. What was <hi>Iacob</hi> to <hi>Rebecca</hi> more than <hi>Esau,</hi> or what Mother doth not more affect the Elder. But now God inclines the love of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Younger, against the custom of Nature, because the Father loves the Elder against the promise. The Affections of Parents are divided, that the Promise might be fulfil'd. <hi>Rebecca's</hi> craft shall answer <hi>Isaac's</hi> partiality. <hi>Isaac</hi> would unjustly turn <hi>Esau</hi> into <hi>Iacob, Rebecca</hi> doth as cunningly turn <hi>Iacob</hi> into <hi>Esau:</hi> her desire was good, her means was unlawful. God doth oft-times effect his just will by our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; yet neither thereby justifying our infirmities, nor blemishing his own actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:36907:25"/>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. Here is nothing but counterfeiting: a fained person, fained name, fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Venison, a fained answer; and yet behold a true blessing, but to the man, not to the means: those were so unsound, that <hi>Iacob</hi> himself doth more fear their curse than hope for their success: but <hi>Rebecca</hi> presuming upon the Oracle of God, and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands simplicity dare be his surety for the danger, his Counsellor for the carriage of the business, his Cook for the Diet; yea dresses both the meat and the man. And now she wishes she could borrow <hi>Esau</hi>'s tongue as well as his garments; that she might se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely deceive all the senses of him, who had suffered himself to be more dangerously deceived by his affection. But this is past her Remedy; her Son must name himself <hi>Esau,</hi> with the voice of <hi>Iacob.</hi> It is hard if our tongue do not bewray what we are in spite of our habit. This was enough to work <hi>Isaac</hi> to a suspition, to an enquiry, not to an incredulity; he that is good of himself will hardly believe evill of another; and will rather distrust his own senses, than the fidelity of those he trusted; all the senses are set to examine, none sticketh at the Judgement but the ear: to deceive that, <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> must second his dissimulation with three lies in one breath; <hi>I am Esau, As thou badst me: My Venison.</hi> Onesin entertain'd fetcheth in another; and if it be forced to lodg alone, either departeth or dieth. I love <hi>Iacobs</hi> blessing, but I hate his lie I would not do that wilfully, which <hi>Iacob</hi> did weakly, on condition of a blessing: he that pardoned his infirmity would curse my obstinateness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 23. Good <hi>Isaac</hi> had first set his hands to try whether his ears inform'd him aright; and then feeling the hands of him whose voice he suspected, that honest heart could not think that the skin might more easily be counterfeited than the Lungs: a smal satisfaction contents those whom guiltiness hath not made scrupulous: <hi>Isaac</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, and blesseth the Younger Son in the Garments of the Elder. If our Heavenly Father smell upon our backs the savour of our Elder Brothers Robes, we cannot depart from him unblessed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 27. As <hi>Isaac</hi> said of his Son here, <hi>The smell of my Son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed.</hi> So the Lord of Heaven as he smelt a savour of rest from the Sacrifice of <hi>Noah</hi> should smell from us (if we intend to be his Sons, and Heirs of the Promise as <hi>Iacob</hi> was) the savour of Medicinal Herbs of remorse, and repentance, and contrition, and detestation of former sins; and the savour of odoriferous, and fragrant, and Aromatical Herbs, Works worthy of Repentance, amendment of Life, Edification of others, and zeal to his Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 32. No sooner is <hi>Iacob</hi> gone away full of the joy of his blessing, then <hi>Esau</hi> comes in full of the hope of the blessing; and now blowing and sweating for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he finds nothing but a Repulse. Lewd men when they think they have earned of God, and come proudly to challenge favour, receive no answer, but <hi>Who art thou?</hi> the hopes of the wicked fail them when they are at the highest; whereas Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren find these comforts in extremity which they durst not expect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 33. Both the Father and the Son wonder at each other; the one with fear, the other with grief; <hi>Isaac</hi> trembled, and <hi>Esau</hi> wept; the one upon Conscience, the other upon Envy. <hi>Isaac's</hi> heart now told him that he should not have purposed the blessing where he did, and that it was due unto him unto whom it was given, and not purposed; hence he durst not reverse that which he had done with Gods will besides his own: for now he saw that he had done unwilling Justice: God will find both time and means to reclaim his own, to prevent their sins, to manifest and reform their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 34. Who would have lookt for tears from <hi>Esau;</hi> or who dare trust tears when he sees them fall from so graceless eyes. It was a good word here, <hi>Bless me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so O my Father:</hi> every miscreant can wish himself well. No man would be miserable if it were enough to desire happiness. Why did he not rather weep to his Brother for the pottage, than to <hi>Isaac</hi> for a blessing? If he had not then sold, he had not needed now to begg; It is just with God to deny us those favours which we were careless in keeping, and which we undervalued in enjoying. How happy a thing it is to know the seasons of Grace, and not to neglect them, how desperate to have known and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36907:25"/>
them! these tears were both late and false, the tears of rage, of envie, of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal desire: worldly sorrow causeth death. Yet whiles <hi>Esau</hi> howls out thus for a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, I hear him cry out of his Fathers store, <hi>(Hast thou but one blessing O my Father?)</hi> of his Brothers subtilty, <hi>(was he not rightly termed</hi> Jacob?) I do not hear him blame his own deserts. He did not see while his Father was deceived and his Brother crafty, that God was just, and himself uncapable: he knew himself prophane, and yet claims a blessing.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. NOne of all the Patriarks saw so evil dayes as <hi>Iacob</hi> did; from whom justly hath the Church of God therefore taken her Name; neither were the Faithful ever since called <hi>Abramites,</hi> but <hi>Israelites.</hi> That no time might be lost, he began his strife in the Womb; after that, he flyes for his life from a cruel Brother to a cruel Uncle. With a Staff goes he over <hi>Iordan</hi> alone, doubtful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortless, not like the Son of <hi>Isaac.</hi> In the way the Earth is his bed, and a stone his pillow; yet even there he sees a Vision of Angels. <hi>Iacob</hi>'s heart was never so full of joy, as when his head lay hardest. God is most present with us in our greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and loves to give comfort to those that are for saken of their hopes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. This Ladder betokeneth Christ, who above is God of his Father, beneath is man out of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Loins, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 51; the Angels ascending and descending are the blessed Spirits; which first ministred to the person of Christ, and secondly for the good of his body, namely, the Elect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. The Angels went up and down; none of them were seen standing still: we must alwayes be going forward in our Christian courses, and not think to be carried to heaven in a feather bed, but we must climb a Ladder: if we expect to be carried as <hi>Elias</hi> was in a Chariot, it will be a fiery Chariot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. Against <hi>Iacob</hi>'s four-fold cross here is a four-fold comfort, a plaister as broad as the sore, and sovereign for it: Against the loss of his Friends, <hi>I will be with thee saith God;</hi> Against the loss of his Country, <hi>I will give thee this Land;</hi> Against his Poverty, <hi>Thou shalt spread abroad to the East, and to the West;</hi> Against his soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tariness and lowness, <hi>Angels shall attend thee, and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth;</hi> whereunto we may add that which surpasseth all the rest, <hi>In thy Seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be blessed:</hi> thy Seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and that dust of the earth shall shine as the stars in heaven: they that trust in the Lord shall have the blessings of both worlds; they shall be blessed here temporally, and hereafter eternally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. It is a great and peculiar priviledge of the Church and every Member of it, to have God present with them, and President over them. He is not far off from those that are his (however in time of Affliction, and in the hour of tentation, he seemeth so to them) but is ever with them, and holdeth a gracious hand over them. This is it which the Lord so often promiseth in his Word, and truly performeth to the great comfort of all his Children. This is it which the Lord speaketh to <hi>Iacob</hi> going from his Fathers house to <hi>Padan Aran, Lo, I am with thee, &amp;c.</hi> And God thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth his presence, that the faithful might be assured of his protection and defence being gathered together by his power, without which they could not have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. If he were not present with us, he could not consider of our wants, nor suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour us in our necessities, nor refresh us with his help while we walk in the valley of the shadow of death. Seeing therefore we have comfort to be preserved in all perils, and to be heard in our Prayers and Requests that we make to God, we are assured and perswaded of his continual presence amongst us for our good and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:36907:26"/>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. Though the Almighty be every where, yet not every where after the same manner, say the Schools; his presence indeed shines forth in all, but not the same degrees of his presence; and though his glory filled both the Bush and the space about it, yet not both alike; the one with fire, the other perchance but with smoak: and therefore we read <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. of a place where <hi>Moses</hi> may stand, and a place so holy whither he may not draw nigh; the first too holy for his shoes, the last too hot for his feet. Thus also we read of Gods House made with hands, and his House not made with hands; and to both Holiness required for their Consecration, and an awful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem for their Diety: Sanctified they must because they are Gods, and Reverenced because he is in them. To witness whose personal residence was that solemne erecting of Altars where God vouchsafed to appear. Thus God here appeared to <hi>Iacob</hi> and strait wayes his Stone is anointed into a Pillar, and what the last night was a pillow for himself, must now be a resting place for his God; there offering up his dues to heaven where he had before to Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. A mean or middle estate, which is neither too eminent nor too obscure, too rich nor too poor, above contempt below envie, is to be preferred before the greatest: first, because it is most free from danger; as not being so low as to be trodden upon, nor so high as to be seated in the eye of envie. Secondly, Because it preserveth us from forgetfulness of God, irreligion, and prophanness, which accompanies prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and from the use of unlawful means to maintain our estate, and from impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, murmuring, and repining against God to which we are tempted in poverty. If then our God hath been so gracious unto us as to give us a convenient competency in these outward matters, let us reckon our lot to have fallen unto us in a pleasant ground, and that we have a goodly heritage. And indeed our Nature desires not much. Food and Raiment are the only necessaries for this life (I mean the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it) we stand in need of. <hi>If God will be with me saith</hi> Jacob, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is all which he doth require: hitherto tend all our earthly labours and industries. Oh that we were wise to consider this, how small a debt we owe to Nature, how little would content it.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. SO should it be with a man after his Communion with God in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it was with <hi>Iacob</hi> after his Communion here with God in <hi>Bethel; Then</hi> Jacob <hi>lift up his feet and came into the Land of the People of the East:</hi> He lift up his feet, he went with strength, with spirit, with cheerfulness: and then he went, that is, after he had had that sweet fellowship with God in <hi>Bethel,</hi> he was so cheer'd and refresh'd with that spiritual bait, that in the strength and force of that, he went on lively and cheerfully in his journey. So when we have had fellowship with God in the Sacrament, in the strength of that heavenly bait at the Sacrament, we should lift up our feet and go on cheerfully, lively, lustily in our journey towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. Masters of Families should so order the Duties of their Families, that every one under their jurisdiction may have such an employment as is most proper for him. Thus here <hi>Rachel</hi> kept the Sheep, while <hi>Leah</hi> had her task within doors. God hath dispensed his Gifts diversly for the common benefit. To one man is given Knowledge, to another the gift of Utterance, to a third is given to speak with diverse Tongues, to a fourth the Interpretation of those Tongues. There is scarce any one but hath something or other in him that is excellent and extraordinary; some special talent to trade with, some Honey to bring to the common hive; if he have but an heart to it. Let every man therefore according to his several ability improve his Talent to the glory of the donor, and the common good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:36907:26"/>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. God hath two Daughters, the younger which is Heaven, is fair and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like <hi>Rachel,</hi> and courted by all; the elder is Repentance, which with tears is blear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed, like <hi>Leah</hi> and neglected by most: but if men ask as <hi>Iacob</hi> for <hi>Rachel,</hi> God will answer as <hi>Laban</hi> did <hi>Iacob, 'Tis not the custome of the place to Marry the Younger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Elder;</hi> he that will not marry the <hi>Leah</hi> of Repentance, shall never have the <hi>Rachel</hi> of Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 20. Iacob</hi> thought seven years service a short time, that he might enjoy <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel;</hi> when his eye was upon his love, he thought seven years, and seven to them, but a small time. Did <hi>Iacob</hi> account so many years but a small time, and shall not we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count seven dayes, seven hours short? Admit it be more, it is but a short time, if we have heaven, if we have <hi>Rachel</hi> in our eye: fix our eyes upon immortality, upon heaven, and then all tribulations will seem not only light, but nothing; and not only short, but as if they had never been, but as yesterday; or as yesterday is to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years, to eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 23. After the service of an hard Apprenticeship had earned her whom <hi>Iacob</hi> loved, his Wife is changed, and he in a sort forced to an unwilling Adultery. His Mother had before substituted him who was the younger Son for the elder; and now not long after his Father-in-law by the like fraud substitutes to him the elder Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the younger. God comes oftentimes home to us in our own kind, and even by the sin of others payes us our own when we look not for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 26. Many things may be Customable which yet are not commendable, and used to be done, which often were better undone. Such practise draws nearer the Doctrine of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> than of Christ. For what was it else that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did so much stand upon under the tradition of the elders; and what did they censure our Saviour and his Disciples so hardly for but their Customes; and what was it that our Saviour did so deeply tax them for but the observation of their superfluous and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Customs. The Fathers and Doctors of the Church were most plain and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in this point, <hi>Veritate manifestata cedat consuetudo veritati:</hi> for Christ said, <hi>I am the Truth;</hi> not, <hi>I am the Custome.</hi> And in truth without this limitation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, if men be carried away with the name of Custome, and will enquire no further into any thing than what is the Custome, what hath been used heretofore; much injury and evil may be committed; Thus <hi>Laban</hi> here deceaving <hi>Iacob</hi> pretends the Custome of the place; it was not forsooth their Custome to marry the younger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the elder: but under that pretence he falsifies his promise, abuseth his Daughter, and deceives his Friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 28. It is doubtful whether it were a greater cross to <hi>Iacob</hi> to marry whom he would not, or to be disappointed of her whom he desired. And now he must begin a new hope where he made account of fruition. To raise up an expectation once frustrate, is more difficult than to continue a long hope drawn on with likelihoods of performance; yet thus dear is <hi>Iacob</hi> content to pay for <hi>Rachel</hi> even fourteen years servitude. Commonly Gods Children come not easily by their pleasures; what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series will not love digest and overcome? And if <hi>Iacob</hi> were willingly consumed with heat in the day, and frost in the night, to become the Son-in-law to <hi>Laban,</hi> what should we refuse to be the Sons of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 31. Rachel</hi> whom <hi>Iacob</hi> loved is barren, <hi>Leah</hi> which was despised is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. How wisely God weighs out to us our Favours and Crosses in an equal ballance: so tempering our sorrows that they may not oppress, and our joyes that they may not transport us. Each one hath some matter of envie to others, and of grief to himself. Thus <hi>Leah</hi> envies <hi>Rachels</hi> beauty and love; <hi>Rachel</hi> envies <hi>Leahs</hi> fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; yet <hi>Leah</hi> would not be barren, nor <hi>Rachel</hi> blear-eyed. And here also we see how the Lord useth to chastise the preposterous affections of his servants, as <hi>Iacob</hi>'s love, with <hi>Rachels</hi> barrenness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 35. Leah</hi> had praised the Lord before at <hi>Rubens</hi> and <hi>Simeons</hi> birth, but now upon the occasion of a new benefit she praiseth him again: which teacheth us, that as Gods Mercies are multiplyed towards us, so we should encrease and go forward in giving of thanks.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. THough <hi>Iacob</hi> was as tender an Husband to <hi>Rachel</hi> as she could be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Children if she had them, yet his love kept within bounds; and he would love his Wife so far as she loved his and her God. If <hi>Rachel</hi> be angry with God, <hi>Iacob</hi> will be angry with <hi>Rachel;</hi> and if she inconsiderately will advance him to Gods seat, and thrust Gods power into his hands, <hi>Iacob</hi> will make use of it to reprove her, and condemne her by asking the question, <hi>Am I in Gods stead,</hi> who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth the key of the Womb under his own girdle. <hi>Moses</hi> was the meekest man on Earth, yet when Gods glory is concerned, and a rebellious people have broke the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, <hi>Moses</hi> will break that Table of stone wherein they were writ, and his anger will destroy part of the people, that Gods anger may not consume them all. Now let us imitate these great examples; and that we may be angry and not sin, let us only be angry for sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. I see in <hi>Rachel</hi> the image of her Grand-mother-<hi>Sarah;</hi> both in her beauty of person, in her actions, in her success: she also will needs suborn her handmaid to make her a Mother, and at last beyond hope her self conceiveth. It is a weak greediness in us to affect Gods blessings by unlawful means: what a proof and praise had it been of her Faith if she had staied Gods leisure, and would rather have endured her barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness than her Husbands <hi>Polygamy.</hi> Now she shews her self the Daughter of <hi>Laban;</hi> the Father for covetousness, the Daughters for emulation have drawn sin into <hi>Iacobs</hi> bed: he offended in yielding, but they more in solliciting him; and therefore the fact is not imputed to <hi>Iacob,</hi> but to them. In those sins which Satan draws us into, the blame is ours; in those sins which we move each other unto, the most fault and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment lies upon the tempter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. Here <hi>Rachel</hi> makes use of Gods name to prophane it; and under pretence of Religion would have God justifie her Maids and her own sin. Many cry up that Cause to be Gods which he never will own, and put his Name to those Writings which at the last day shall condemne them. And indeed there hath of late years been no sin so common among Christians as to prostitue both Gods Name and his Cause; and as that great Commander of the powers of darkness, the Devil, can transform himself into an Angel of light; so there are no deeds of darkness so black and ugly which have not been like their Father the Devil mask'd, and veil'd, and clouded even with light its self; I mean with those glorious, heavenly, Angel-like pretences of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Conscience. Insomuch that not only the most unchristian, but the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane practises, the most unnatural savage barbarities of this last age of the World are now avowed to be the dictates and commands of God, that God himself (as in the text) hath judged and allowed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 18. Leah</hi> broke the bonds of Matrimony and yet expects a reward: thus many times men flatter themselves in their sins, and think that they are rewarded of God when they do ill. As <hi>Micah</hi> (having made houshold gods, and entertained a Levite) cryes, <hi>Now I know that the Lord will be good unto me because I have a Levite to my Priest;</hi> but he never thought he had an Idol to his God. Thus <hi>Leah</hi> here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in that for which she should have repented, and takes that for her hire, which God, for all she knew, intended as her punishment. And indeed her Son <hi>Issachar</hi> (who was the hire here) was none of the wisest, and withal a slave: and therefore in <hi>Iacobs</hi> Prophesie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. compared to an Ass, and one that for his ease would sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto any burthens, impositions, taxes. This was a simple, low, poor spirit; and his posterity were for the general very unworthy and vile: and yet this was the hire, the reward, the blessing that <hi>Leah</hi> rejoyced in; as if God had approved of the sin by the success and fruitfulness of her handmaids Womb: and this was her error
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36907:27"/>
of measuring and judging of things by the success: as if God did not many times give Children, and Honour, and Riches in his wrath, and were not many times angry with men though they outwardly prosper. If this were not so the Turks and some Christians too at this day were in an happy condition, who judge of the goodness of their cause only by the success; and because they are not crossed, that therefore they are blessed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. Children are a good dowry if they prove good; and though they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes an heritage that cometh of the Lord, yet they are not alwayes the Lords he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage: When our Children appear to be Gods heirs as well as ours, then may we justly esteem them to be the best part of our estate, and our greatest dowry. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they will prove but sad blessings, and such as we had better be without; and yet all men desire them: how much rather should we cover grace, and those things which accompany salvation; having got these we may safely and surely say, <hi>God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued me with a good dowry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 27. Iacob</hi> rich in nothing but Wives and Children was now returning to his Fathers house, accounting his Charge his Wealth. But God meant him yet more good. <hi>Laban</hi> sees that both his Family and his Flocks were well encreased by <hi>Iacobs</hi> service. Not his love therefore, but his gain makes him loth to part. Even <hi>Labans</hi> covetousness, is made by God the means to enrich <hi>Iacob:</hi> and even his strait Master entreats him to that recompence which made his Nephew mighty, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self envious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 41. In the very shapes and colours of brute Creatures there is a divine hand which disposeth them to his own ends. Small and unlikely means shall prevail where God intends an effect. Little peel'd sticks of Hazel or Poplar laid in the troughs, shall enrich <hi>Iacob</hi> with an encrease of spotted Cattel. <hi>Labans</hi> Sons might have tryed the same means and failed. God would have <hi>Laban</hi> know that he put a difference betwixt <hi>Iacob</hi> and him; that as for fourteen years he had multiplyed <hi>Iacobs</hi> charge of Cattel to <hi>Laban,</hi> so now for the last six years he would multiply <hi>Labans</hi> Flock to <hi>Iacob:</hi> and if <hi>Laban</hi> had the more, yet the better were <hi>Iacobs.</hi> Even in these outward things Gods Children have many times sensible tastes of his favours above the wicked.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. VVHen God appeared here to <hi>Iacob</hi> upon his return from <hi>Laban,</hi> he tells him <hi>I am the God of Bethel:</hi> by which expression he no doubt intends to mind <hi>Iacob</hi> of the Promise, not only made there by God to him, but likewise by him to God; for so it followeth, <hi>Where thou vowedst a vow to me.</hi> God is the God of pious resolutions as to approve of them, when made, so to look after them how they are made good; and let me tell you, to prophane that heart that is once conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to God, to faulter in the execution of what is solemnly resolved in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is a fetching the Sacrifice from the Altar, and will certainly bring the coal of fire along with it. Hadst thou never put in for the title of a Friend or votary, with an <hi>O God my heart is ready to do thy will,</hi> thou hadst not been perfidious, though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane; but by breaking thy promise thou addest the guilt of unfaithfulness to that of disobedience, and thy sin becomes beyond measure sinful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. I know not whether <hi>Laban</hi> were a worse Uncle, or Father, or Master: he can like well <hi>Iacobs</hi> service, not his wealth: as the wicked have no peace with God, so the godly have no peace with men; for if they prosper not, they are despised; if they prosper they are envied. This Uncle, whom <hi>Iacobs</hi> service had made his Father, must now upon his wealth be fled from as an enemy. <hi>Iacob</hi> knew his churlishness, and therefore resolves to be rather unmannerly, than injur'd: well might he think that he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36907:28"/>
whose oppression chang'd his wages so often in his stay, would also abridg his Wages in the parting. Now therefore he wisely prefers his own estate to <hi>Labans</hi> love. It is not good to regard too much the unjust discontentment of worldly men, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase unprofitable favour, with too great loss.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 24. The Lord hath a negative voice upon the motion of all Creatures; he commandeth the Sun and it riseth not. It is a royal prerogative that the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Sun to rise; but that the Lord hath a power to stay the Sun from rising, lifts up his prerogative to the highest. In all disputes about Power, he is resolved to be greatest who hath the negative voice, which checks and gives a <hi>super sedeas</hi> to all others; this is the prerogative of God, he can stay the motion of the Sun, and of man. The Sun dares not do his Office to the day, nor the Stars to the night, if God say no. Thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so he stops man in his nearest preparation for any action. When <hi>Laban</hi> pursued <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> with hard thoughts against him, and strong resolutions to deal harshly with him, the Lord gave a negative voice, <hi>Take heed that thou speak not to Iacob either good or bad:</hi> when God commands, <hi>Laban</hi> shall not have the use of his own tongue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 29. As God sometimes said to Satan, <hi>Afflict the body of Iob, but save his life;</hi> so God saith still to bloody wretches who are the Limbs of Satan, the bodies of such and such are in your hands, the estates of such and such are in your hands, but save their lives; the life of a man is never at the mercy of a Creature, though it be a common speech of men when they have a man under them, now I have you at my mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; though some bragg as <hi>Laban</hi> did here to <hi>Iacob,</hi> it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt; yet God often checks them, as he did <hi>Laban,</hi> from so much as speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt. Creatures though full of Love, cannot speak good, and though full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, they cannot speak bad if God forbid: then much less can they do us hurt, and least of all hurt our lives, if God with-hold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 32. Though <hi>Iacob</hi> when he fled from his Father-in-Law <hi>Laban,</hi> were free enough himself from the theft of <hi>Laban</hi>'s Idols, yet it was dangerously pronounc'd of him with whomsoever thou findest thy Idols, let him not live: for his own Wife <hi>Rachel</hi> had stoln them; and <hi>Caro conjux;</hi> thy Wife thy self thy weaker part may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate much sin into thine actions, even when thy spit is at strongest, and thou in thy best confidence. Only thus these two cases may differ; <hi>Rachel</hi> was able to cover those stoln Idols from her Fathers finding with that excuse <hi>the custome of Women is come upon me;</hi> but thou shalt not be able to cover thy stoln sins with saying the infirmity of man is come upon me, I do but as other men do.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 37. When controversies arise, the rule of love bids us refer our differences to the determination of Brethren. In the first and best times men did not presently run to Law; and call one another before the Judge; they had daies-men, and Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires to determine matters between them. To bring every matter to the Judgement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seat when possibly a Brother or a Friend, might take up the matter is a transgression a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law of Love. We should rather labour after reconcilements, than Sutes in Law; which are a cause not only of trouble and expence, but of great breaches and heart-burnings among Friends and Brethren; 'tis rare if a man wrongs not his Soul by seeking the rights of his credit or estate.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 41. The children of this World are wise in their Generations, omitting no manner of means to bring their purposes to pass. We may observe by continual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the nature of ungodly men; they are subtile and cunning in their kind, they watch their waies and times to fit them, to work out their wicked devises and inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus did <hi>Laban</hi> deal with <hi>Iacob,</hi> changing his mind, revoking his bargains, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his wages, and murmuring at his prosperity. Now seeing this is the nature of the enemies of the Church, this should on the other side teach us to deal wisely and warily with them, lest we be snared and circumvented by them; we are set as upon an hill, we are placed as upon a Stage; if we profess Christ Jesus, a smal spot will be seen in our garment. It behoves us therefore to be wise as Serpents, and innocent as Doves; the wisdom of our enemies is joyned with wickedness, our wisdom must be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36907:28"/>
mix'd with godliness. Their wisdom is a circumventing by laying of snares, our wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom must be to be circumspect in avoiding of snares.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 55. Behold! <hi>Laban</hi> follows <hi>Iacob</hi> with one Troop in this Chapter, and in Chapter 23. <hi>Esau</hi> meets him with another, both with hostile intentions: both go on till the utmost point of their execution, both are prevented ere the execution. God makes fools of the enemies of his Church, he lets them proceed that they may be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and when they are gone to the utmost reach of their tether, he pulls them back to their task with shame: Lo now <hi>Iacob</hi> is left by <hi>Laban</hi> with a kiss: of the one he hath an Oath, tears of the other, peace with both; who shall need to fear man that is at league with God.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. THe Rabbins note that <hi>Iacob</hi> knew these Angels to be the same which he saw ascending and descending the ladder: and whereas <hi>Iacob</hi> is not said to meet them, but they to meet <hi>Iacob,</hi> therein appeareth the dignity and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of the Saints, whom the Angels are ready to attend.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. Strong desires are importunate, and will improve every interest for the obtaining of what is desired. What we cannot carry upon our own interest, we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to carry upon any other more prevailing name and interest. <hi>Iacob</hi> here moves the Lord in his prayers by the remembrance of his Fathers <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac; O God of my Father Abraham, and God of my Father Isaac. Iacob</hi> did not pray to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham,</hi> but he made use of his Fathers Name as a motive in prayer; and though all names and interests are swallowed up in the name and interest of Jesus Christ, as to the deserving a grant of what we pray for; yet we may argue and plead with God in prayer for the Churches sake, yea for our own Childrens sake, that God would do us good, that we may be further instrumental for their good.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. When a poor Soul considers what God hath done for him, in admitting him into communion with himself to eat bread at his table continually, he cries out even weeping for admiration as <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam. 9. What is thy servant that thou shouldest look on such a dead dogg as I am,</hi> and when he considers from what a low to what an high estate God hath brought him, he saith as <hi>Iacob</hi> here, <hi>I am less than the least of all thy mercies,</hi> and when Christ tells a Soul that he will make him a King and a Priest to God, he humbly saith as <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Samuel;</hi> am not I a <hi>Benjamite of the smallest of the Tribes of Israel,</hi> yea it saith as <hi>Elizabeth</hi> said to <hi>Mary</hi> the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Mother of our ever blessed Jesus, when she heard the Salutation that the Babe (the heart of a true Believer) leap'd within her, and she spake, <hi>Blessed art thou; whence, O whence is this to me, that the Mother of my Lord,</hi> (Oh saith the Soul that my God) <hi>should come to see me,</hi> even me, poor worthless me; it fares with such a Soul as with the Disciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. Jesus stood in the midst and said, <hi>Peace be unto you,</hi> and they were terrified and affrighted; but he said, <hi>Why are ye troubled? it is I, behold my hands and my feet,</hi> and they believed not for joy and wondred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. It is like that <hi>Esau</hi> prepared himself to be revenged of <hi>Iacob,</hi> as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by <hi>Iacobs</hi> prayer and fear here, which was not without cause: whereby the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God is also set forth, that could in the very way change that purpose of <hi>Esau:</hi> and withall <hi>Iacob</hi> sheweth in this his weakness and infirmity; that although looking to Gods promise, he had confidence, yet turning himself to the present danger he fear'd; and here, while <hi>Iacob</hi> prepared himself by war, prayer, and gifts to satisfie his Brother he doth well; for though God hath promised us deliverance, we ought to use all good means, and working, under Gods providence.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. Prayer is not only a bare manifestation of our mind to God, by such a sute or petition; but in Prayer there is or ought to be an holy arguing with God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the matter which we declare; which is a bringing out, and urging of reasons and motives, whereby the Lord may be moved to grant what we pray for: and this is clear from this example of <hi>Iacob</hi> in this Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 24. When we are most retired from the World, then we are most fit to have and usually have most communion with God. <hi>David</hi> shews us divine work when we go to rest; the bed is not all for sleep; <hi>commune with your own hearts upon your bed, and be still, Psal.</hi> 4. be still and quiet, and then commune with your hearts, God will come and commune with them to, his Spirit will give you a loving visit. When <hi>Iacob</hi> fearing the rage of his Brother, had put himself into the best posture and defence he could, and had sent his Wives and Children over the River, the Text saith that he was left alone; which is not to be understood, as if his company had left or deserted him; <hi>Iacob</hi>'s solitariness was not passive, but effective; he having disposed of all his Family, withdrew himself, and stayed alone; and what then? then he had a Vision in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; then there wrestled a man with him till the breaking of the day: he spent not the night in carping and caring what should become of him to morrow; no he retires to pray for a blessing upon his former cares, and a blessing he obtains.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 25. What a wonder is here? <hi>Iacob</hi> received not so much hurt from all his enemies, as from his best Friends; not one of his hairs perish'd by <hi>Laban</hi> or <hi>Esau,</hi> yet he lost a joynt, by the Angel, and was sent halting to his Grave; he that knows our strength, yet will wrestle with us for our exercise, and loves our violence and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, O happy loss this of <hi>Iacob;</hi> he lost a joint, and won a blessing: it is a favour to halt from God; yet this favour is seconded with a greater. He was blest because he would rather halt, than leave ere he was blessed. If he had left sooner he had not halted, but then he had not prospered; that man shall go away sound but miserable, that loves a limb more than a blessing. Surely if <hi>Iacob</hi> had not wrestled with God, he had been folid with evils, how many are the troubles of the righteous!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 30. Holy men even in this life have a sight of the face of God: the Soul of a Believer hath interviews with God; God and he do often look one another in the face. Wheresoever the Saints are except in cases of desertion, the place may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (as <hi>Iacob</hi> here call'd this where he wrestled with God) <hi>Peniel,</hi> that is, the face of God; yet not in that sence fully in which <hi>Iacob</hi> calls it so; he call'd it the face of God, because he had seen God face to face. We can call it so only (ordinarily) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we see his face. It is one thing to see the face of God, another thing to see God face to face; the former is the common priviledge of Saints in this life, the latter is the priviledge of but some Saints, and those rare ones, to have it here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 31. At death God wrestles with his people, laying hold on their Consciences by the menaces of the Law. They again resist this assault by laying hold upon God in Christ by the Faith of the Gospel; well assured that Christ hath freed them from the curse of the Law, by being made a curse for them on the Cross. God yields himself over-come by this re-encounter, but yet toucheth their thigh, takes away their life: howbeit, this hinders not the Sun of Life Eternal to arise upon them.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. VArious and miraculous are the means which God useth to deliver his People from their Enemies; sometimes he divides them, and sets the Churches enemies one against another: so he did for <hi>Gideon</hi>'s small Army to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites</hi> mighty Host, setting every mans Sword against his fellow; sometimes he changeth their minds, and turneth the stream of their affections. Thus was <hi>Esau</hi>'s heart mollified towards <hi>Iacob,</hi> who instead of a devouring enemy becomes an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing friend, and meets him with kisses, to whom he had intended blowes. Indeed what <hi>Solomon</hi> saith of the Kings heart is true of all mens, <hi>That they are in the hands of the Lord as the Rivers of Waters, and he turneth them wheresoever he will:</hi> No wonder then if sometimes he mollifies the Obdurate, qualifies the Malicious, and melts the Frozen Hearts of Wicked men into Love and Compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. Children are the blessings of the Lord, nay, they are part of his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Children are an heritage of the Lord, saith the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> and the fruit of the Womb is his reward: they are special blessings. Children (as it is to be observed) are a resemblance of our immortality, because man revives again, lives a-new (as it were) in every Child: he is born again (in a civil sence) when others are born to him. There are some who count their Children but Bills of Charges, but God puts them upon the account of our Mercies. And therefore how holy and piously doth <hi>Iacob</hi> speak here concerning his Children; <hi>These</hi> (saith he) <hi>are the Children which God hath graciously given thy Servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. The carnal minded man looks no further than this world; and if he can get but his Chests and his Barns fill'd, thinks he may say with <hi>Esau</hi> here, <hi>I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough Brother;</hi> and that he may sing a <hi>Requiem</hi> to his Soul with that rich man in the Gospel, <hi>Soul, take thine ease, thou hast Goods laid up for many years;</hi> when God in the mean time is not thought upon, without whom there can be no true fulness, no sincere abundance. Let us therefore accustome our selves to find out God in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in all our gettings, in all our preferments, in all our studies; and then be we as covetous as we will, as ambitious as we can, we shall be sure to have enough; for God will be abundantly sufficient to us for all. God is treasure, and God is honour enough. Wouldst thou have all this World, wouldst thou have all the next World too? <hi>Plus est qui fecit Coelum &amp; Terram,</hi> saith a Father; he that made Heaven and Earth is more than all that, and thou mayest have all in having him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. Wicked men cannot be so ill as they would. That strong Wrestler a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom <hi>Iacob</hi> prevailed, prevailed with <hi>Esau,</hi> and turned his wounds into kisses. An Host of Men came with <hi>Esau,</hi> an Army of Angels met <hi>Iacob. Esau</hi> threatned, <hi>Iacob</hi> prayed. His prayers and presence have melted the heart of <hi>Esau</hi> into love. And now instead of the grim and stern countenance of an Executioner <hi>Iacob</hi> sees the face of <hi>Esau</hi> as the face of God. Both men and Devils are stinted; the stoutest heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stand out against God. He that can wrestle earnestly with God, is secure from the harms of men. Those minds which are exaspearated with violence, and cannot be broken with fear, yet are bowed with love: when the wayes of a man please God, he will make his enemies at peace with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. If we want this Worlds good, let us not be discouraged; God often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times recompenseth the want of earthly blessings with great abundance of heavenly graces. This Christ declareth in <hi>Rev. 2. I know thy works, and tribulation, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, but thou art rich.</hi> He maketh them rich in Knowledge, in Faith, in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Joy in the holy Ghost. He blesseth them with inward comfort, and with peace of Conscience that passeth all understanding. He giveth them patience in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36907:30"/>
trouble, meekness of spirit, and an holy contentation, to sustain the weight of their affliction: and albeit they bear a gracious burthen, yet he hath eased them of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the burthen of their sins, which in Christ they feel to be lightned and remitted. This the Apostle testifieth, <hi>We are as dying, and yet behold we live; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</hi> This is that <hi>Iacob</hi> perswaded his own heart, and told it to his Brother, <hi>God hath shewed mercy unto me, and therefore I have all things:</hi> for so it is in the Original, not <hi>I have enough,</hi> (as it is in our English Bibles) but <hi>I have all. Esau</hi> had <hi>much,</hi> but <hi>Iacob</hi> had <hi>all,</hi> because he had the <hi>God of all.</hi>

They must have an eye to the weak ones of their Congregations, and so to respect all, as they over-drive none. He must so Preach as his people are able to hear, and not alwayes as he is able to Preach. He must divide, and chew, and masticate his Matter and his Doctrines as Nurses do their Childrens meat, and speak to the shallowest Capacities of his Hearers; else he shall be a <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> to them, and they to him. And as in their instruction, so likewise in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs and correction, they must have a care of the little Ones, of the tender Lambs of Christ's flock, and deal gently with them. A <hi>Venice-</hi>glass must be otherwise handled than an Earthen-pitcher; some must be rebuked sharply, severely, but of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>we must have compassion, making a difference,</hi> Jude 22.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. CHristians should of all others be very shy of the occasions of evil, and take heed of the Wine when 'tis red in the glass, and have an eye to their eye when they look on a Maid. <hi>Dinah</hi> out of a gadding curiosity must needs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit the Daughters of the Land; and while she goeth to see the Daughters, the Son saw her, <hi>visamque cupit,</hi> and having seen her he took her, having taken her he lay with her: the report whereof coming to <hi>Iacobs</hi> Sons they were grieved; being grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they were wroth; being wroth they meditate revenge; meditating revenge they speak deceitfully; having deceived they slew; having slain they spoyle. See how great a fire a little matter kindleth, what great evils issue from small beginnings: take heed then of these beginnings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 3. Shechem</hi> in this <hi>verse</hi> bewrays a good nature even in filthiness; he loves <hi>Dinah</hi> after his sin, and would needs Marry her whom he had defiled. Commonly Lust ends in loathing. <hi>Ammon</hi> abhors <hi>Tamar</hi> as much after the act, as before he loved; and beats her out of doors, whom he was sick to bring in. But <hi>Shechem</hi> would not let <hi>Dinah</hi> fare the worse for his sin. And now he goes about to entertain her with honest love, whom the rage of his Lust had dishonestly abused. Her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flouring shall be no prejudice to her, since her shame shall redound to none but him, and he will hide her dishonour with the name of an Husband. Those actions that are ill begun, can hardly be salved up with late satisfactions; whereas good entrances give strength to the proceedings, and success to the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. I find but one only Daughter of <hi>Iacob;</hi> who must needs therefore be a great Darling to her Father; and she so miscarries that she causes her Fathers grief to be more than his love. As her Mother <hi>Leah,</hi> so she hath a fault in her eyes, which was curiosity. She will needs see and be seen, and whiles she doth vainly see, she is seen lustfully. It is not enough for us to look to our own thoughts, except we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the provocations of others. If we once wander out of the Lists that God hath set us in our Callings, there is nothing but danger: her virginity had been safe had she kept home; or if <hi>Shechem</hi> had forced her in her Mothers Tent, this loss of her virginity had been without her sin, now she is not innocent that gave the occasion. Her eyes were guilty of the temptation: only to see is an insufficient warrant to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36907:30"/>
draw us into places of spiritual hazard. If <hi>Shechem</hi> had seen her busie at home, his love had been free from outrage; now the lightness of her presence gave encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his inordinate desire. Immodesty of behaviour makes way to lust, and gives life unto wicked hopes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. The two old men, <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Hamor,</hi> would have ended the matter peaceably, but youth commonly undertakes rashly, and performs with passion. The Sons of <hi>Iacob</hi> think of nothing but revenge, and which is worst of all begin their cruelty with craft, and hide their craft with Religion. A smiling malice is most dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and hatred doth most rankle the heart when it is kept in, and dissembled. <hi>We cannot give our Sister to an uncircumcised man;</hi> here was God in the mouth, and Satan in the heart. The bloodiest of all Projects have ever wont to be coloured with Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; because the worse any thing is, the better shew it desires to make; and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the better colour is put upon any vice the more odious it is: for as every simula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion adds to an evil, so the best adds most evil: themselves had taken the Daughters and Sisters of uncircumcised men; yea, <hi>Iacob</hi> himself did so; why might not then an uncircumcised man obtain their Sister? Or if there be a difference of giving and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, it had been well if it had not been only pretended. It had been an happy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishment of <hi>Dinah</hi> that should have drawn a whole Country into the bosome of the Church; but here was a Sacrament intended not to the good of the soul, but to the murther of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 15. Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> when they meditate their revenge for the Rape com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon their Sister, when they pretended Peace yet they required a little bloud, they would have the <hi>Shechemites</hi> Circumcised; but when they had opened a Vein, they made them bleed to Death; when they were under the soreness of Circumcision, they slew them all. Gods Justice required bloud likewise, the bloud of his Son; but that bloud is not spilt as was the bloud of these <hi>Shechemites,</hi> but poured from that Head to our Hearts, into the Veins and Wounds of our own Souls. In the Circumcision and Passion of our Saviour there was Bloud shed, but no Bloud lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 23. It was an hard task for <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>Shechem</hi> not only to put the knife to their own fore-skins, but to perswade a multitude to so painful a condition. Now to bring this about, as the Sons of <hi>Iacob</hi> dissembled with them, so they dissemble with the people; <hi>Shall not all their flocks and substance be ours?</hi> Common profit is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended when as only <hi>Shechems</hi> pleasure is meant. No motive is so powerful to the vulgar sort as the name of Commodity; the hope of this makes them prodigal of their skin and bloud; not the love to the Sacrament, nor the love to <hi>Shechem:</hi> sinister re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects draw more to the profession of Religion than Conscience; if it were not for the Loaves and Fishes, the train of Christ would be less. But the Sacraments of God mis-received, never prosper in the end. These men are content to smart, so they may gain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 25. Now that every one lies sore of his own Wound, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> rush in armed, and wound all the Males to death: <hi>Cursed be their Wrath for it was fierce, and their Rage for it was cruel.</hi> Indeed filthiness should not have been wrought in <hi>Israel;</hi> yet murther should not have been wrought by <hi>Israel.</hi> If they had been fit Judges, which were but bloudy Executioners, how far doth the punishment exceed the fault. To punish above the offence, is no less injustice than to offend. One of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth, and all feel the revenge: yea, all the innocent suffer that revenge, which he that offended deserved not. <hi>Shechem</hi> sinneth, but <hi>Dinah</hi> tempted him. She that was so light as to wander abroad alone only to gaze, I fear was not over-difficult to yield: and if having wrought her shame, he had driven her home with disgrace to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Tent, such tyrannous lust had justly called for bloud: but now he craves, and offers, and would pay dear for but leave to give satisfaction: to execute rigor upon a submiss offendor is more merciless than just: or if the punishment had been both just and proportionable from another, yet from them which had vowed Peace and Affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it was shamefully unjust. To disappoint the Trust of another, and to neglect
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36907:31"/>
our own promise and fidelity for private purposes, adds faithlessness unto our cruelty.</p>
               <p>

Who would have looked to have found this outrage in the Family of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob?</hi> How did that good Patriarch, when he saw <hi>Dinah</hi> come home blubber'd and wringing her hands, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> sprinkled with bloud, wish that <hi>Leah</hi> had been barren as long as <hi>Rachel.</hi> Good Parents have grief enough though they sustain no blame for their Childrens sins. What great evils arise from small beginnings. The idle curiosity of <hi>Dinah</hi> hath bred all this mischeif. Ravishment follows upon her wandring, upon her ravishment murther, upon the murther spoyl. It is holy and safe to be jealous of the first occasions of evil, either done or suffered.</p>

Most mens practice proclaims, that, having escaped the danger, they would willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Saint. Deliverances commonly are but nine dayes wonder at most, and it is ten to one that any Leper returns to give praise to God. If any thing doth rouze up our hearts to thankful remembrance of former Mercies, it must be the sense of some present misery: as here <hi>Iacob</hi> was in a strait and fright; his Sons had troubled him, the Country was ready to rise upon him and rout him out; and now God takes this opportunity (for we are best when at worst) and gently minds him of what was his duty, and would be for his safety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. The Lord hath a Negative voice upon the motion of all Creatures. We see an instance of this here; when <hi>Iacob</hi> and his Family journied, the terror of God was upon the Cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the Sons of <hi>Iacob:</hi> they had a mind to pursue and revenge the slaughter of the <hi>Sheche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> but God said <hi>Pursue not;</hi> and then they could not pursue, they must stay at home. Thus also when his People the <hi>Iewes</hi> were safe in <hi>Canaan,</hi> he encourages them to come up freely to Worship at <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> by this assurance, <hi>No man shall desire thy Land when thou shalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God.</hi> God can stop not only hands from spoyling, but hearts from desiring. Our appetite whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscible or irrascible are under his command, as well as our actions: we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this to help our Faith in these times. The Sword is in motion among us, even as the Sun; and the Sword seems to have received a charge to pass from the one end of the Land to the other; yet a counter-mand from God will stop the Sword from going on; If he speak to the Sword, the Sword shall wound no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 10. Thy name shall be called no more</hi> Jacob, <hi>but</hi> Israel. That is, not only, or not so much <hi>Iacob</hi> as <hi>Israel.</hi> Both which Names he had given him of striving and strugling. All Gods <hi>Israel</hi> are Wrestlers by Calling, and as good Souldiers of Jesus Christ must suffer hardship. Nothing is to be seen in the <hi>Shulamite</hi> but as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of two Armies maintaining civil broils within her; the Spinit warreth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Flesh, and the Flesh against the Spirit. Wherefore we have more than need to take unto us the whole Armour of God, and to strengthen our selves with every piece of it. At no place must we lie open, for our enemy is a Serpent; if he can but bite the heel, he will transfuse his venome to the heart and head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. We see here how <hi>Iacob</hi> is tryed with a new cross, deprived of his Crown, his Stay, his Comfort, his Wife. Which is writ for our instruction, to teach us that Gods Children must not look to live at ease in this life. They must not Prophecy of Peace to themselves, <hi>That there shall be no leading into Captivity, and no complaining
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36907:31"/>
in our streets.</hi> They must not dream that they shall be alwayes carried on Eagles wings, but their dreams must be of Willow-trees by the Waters of <hi>Babel,</hi> of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and crosses: a Christian must be a daily cross-bearer: which made this Patriarch in another place say, <hi>Few and evil have the dayes of my Pilgrimage been.</hi> The Child of God, a Son of <hi>Iacob,</hi> must not think to walk in plain and easie paths to heaven; but must climb hard, it is all up-hill; the way lieth <hi>inter Epauleum &amp; Magdalum,</hi> as the Septuagint read the text, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 2. that is, by turreting and towering, turning and winding, as <hi>Origen</hi> Expounds it; Never any went to Heaven with dry eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 22. Iacob</hi>'s life was a continual warfare. First <hi>Rachel,</hi> the comfort of his life, dieth; and when, but in her travel, and in his travel to his Father? Then his Children, the staff of his age, wound his Soul to the death. <hi>Reuben</hi> proves incestuous, <hi>Iudah</hi> adulterous, <hi>Dinah</hi> ravished, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> murtherous. <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan</hi> stricken dead, <hi>Ioseph</hi> lost, <hi>Simeon</hi> imprisoned; <hi>Benjamin</hi> the death of his Mother, the Fathers right hand, endangered; himself driven by Famine in his old age to die a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> a people that held it an abomination to eat with him. Thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are the troubles wherewith the Lord tryeth his Children. And if that God with whom he strove, and who therefore strove for him, had not delivered his soul out of all adversity, he had been supplanted with evils, and had been so far from gaining the name of <hi>Israel,</hi> that he had lost the name of <hi>Iacob.</hi> Now what Son of <hi>Israel</hi> can hope for good dayes, when he hears his Fathers were so evil. It is enough for us if when we are dead we can rest with him in the Land of Promise. If the Angel of the Covenant once bless us, no pain, no sorrows can make us miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>

                  <hi>Verse 1. DEmosthenes</hi> (that great popular Orator) was wont to hugg himself as he went in the streets, to hear the Common People say as he passed by, <hi>This is Demosthenes, There goes the great Orator:</hi> but it can be no Joy, nor Credit for any man to be pointed at and stigmatized by the People for an infamous person. <hi>This is Edom,</hi> is no Commendation though Registred in the Book of God; no happiness for <hi>Esau</hi> to find his Name in Scripture in the Book of God, unless he could find it also in the Book of Life. It had been happier for <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> if their Names might have been forgotten, than to be remembred under those ignominious Characters of <hi>Iudas the Traitor,</hi> and <hi>Ieroboam that made Israel to sin.</hi> The wicked though they think to get them a Name, and to that end lay Plots to keep it up, and protect both it and themselves; yet their Names shall either rot and perish, or if they be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, it shall be only (as his was that burnt the Temple of <hi>Diana)</hi> as a Curse in the Nation wherein they live, as the publick fire-brands and incendiaries, the common plague, ruine, and desolation of their Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 6. Esau</hi> no doubt was as strong, if not stronger than <hi>Iacob,</hi> yet fled before his face; surely there was something in it more than the power of <hi>Iacob</hi> that daunted <hi>Esau,</hi> and something more than ordinary appeared in <hi>Iacobs</hi> face, from which <hi>Esau</hi> fled; there was a divine Majesty seated there, and with this <hi>Esau</hi> was not acquainted; and therefore it struck a terror into him and made him fly: and all this not without a special Providence of God to make room for the right Heir. <hi>Canaan</hi> was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Land, but not for <hi>Esau;</hi> he had sold his Birth-right, and with that the Promise which was annexed to it: the Land flowing with milk and honey was too good for him that valued a mess of Pottage above the Blessing of the first-born. A <hi>Iacob</hi> only, one blessed of God, was to inherit that Country which should afterwards be blessed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36907:32"/>
by the Son of God: the <hi>Holy Land</hi> was no inheritance for an <hi>Esau,</hi> a prophane person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 20. Esau</hi> was by Marriage allied to this <hi>Seir;</hi> for he took <hi>Aholibamah,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Anah,</hi> to Wife, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. and yet the Posterity of <hi>Esau</hi> were so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural as to drive their own Kinsmen out of their Country, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2. 12. No tyes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Bloud, or Friendship, or Nature, or Religion, are able to hold wicked men, when Ambition, or Covetousness drives them on: the Sons of <hi>Esau</hi> value not their nearest Relations; an Estate to them is of far greater esteem then Kindred or Friends, then either their Brother, their Father, or their God himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 31. As <hi>Esau</hi> was the first-born, so he was the first King likewise; and good reason the Elder Brother should wear the Crown before the younger; especially since <hi>Iacobs</hi> Portion was not so much a temporal Crown as an eternal. For though <hi>Iacob</hi> by Gods Decree was to have the blessing, yet not the inheritance of the first-born: temporal Estates or Dominions are not entailed to Grace, neither can the Children of God, as such, challenge to themselves the power and authority of other men; as their King, so their Kingdom is not of this World. And therefore let <hi>Esau</hi> Reign, and <hi>Edom</hi> have Kings, while <hi>Iacob</hi> is a Slave, an <hi>Israel</hi> under and <hi>Egyptian</hi> Captivity; yet <hi>Iacob</hi> shall Reign at last, and that for ever; and <hi>Israel</hi> have a King whose sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty shall spread over the whole World, and endure longer than it: the Scepter shall not depart from <hi>Iudah</hi> until <hi>Shilo</hi> come, no nor then neither; <hi>for his Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and his Dominion endureth throughout all Generations, Psal.</hi> 145. 13.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 43. When <hi>Edom</hi> (in the 31 <hi>verse</hi> of this <hi>Chapter)</hi> was a King, then was <hi>Israel</hi> a Slave; but here when <hi>Edom</hi> was a Duke, <hi>Israel</hi> was a King: which instructs us not to look at the beginning of Gods Providence, but the end and design of it: <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is Peace, saith the Psalm.</hi> 38. 37. And therefore let the wicked, how prosperous, how secure, how merry soever they be, remember this in the midst of their joy, that their Master the Devil gives them pleasant entrances into their wayes, but reserves the bitterness for the end of their journey; and on the contrary let the Righteous, how sad, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, how dejected soever they be, remember this in the midst of their tears, that God their Father invites them to the worst Dish at first, and sweetens their conclusion with pleasure; and let them assure themselves, that though the first hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that God gives them in their voyage to the Land of Promise be a Wilderness of Bryars and Thorns, and the first Waters that they must drink in that Wilderness, be Waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> the bitter water of their own tears; yet in the end of their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they shall over-flow with the milk and honey of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of eternal peace and happiness.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. I Marvel not that <hi>Ioseph</hi> had a double Portion of <hi>Iacobs</hi> Land, who had more than two parts of his sorrows: none of his Sons did so truly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit his afflictions, none of them was either so miserable, or so great; suffering is the way to Glory. I see him not a clearer Type of Christ than of every Christian: because we are dear to our Father and complain of sins, therefore are we hated of our carnal Brethren; if <hi>Ioseph</hi> had not medled with his Brothers faults, yet he had been envied for his Fathers affection; but now malice is met with envie. There is nothing more thankless and dangerous than to stand in the way of a resolute sinner. That which doth correct and oblige the penitent, makes the wilful mind furious and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. Hence we may learn how inconvenient a thing it is for Parents to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in their love to their Children; and withal that it is no marvel that brethren fall out for Goods and Land, when <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren hated him for a Coat. We may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also consider from this place, how few men judge themselves happy or unhappy according to what they are, but by comparing themselves with others: where all go naked, none are ashamed. Many augment their misery by seeing others more happy; and yet think themselves happy when they see others more miserable. We many times gather our sorrows from others joyes, and our joyes from others sorrows. We bless our selves when we see them below us; and yet think all we have to be no blessing, when we look on them that are above us. Lord, let not me think my good the less, because others have more; or my evil the more, because others have less: but let me learn in all estates to be content, and to welcome the Will of God let it come how it will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. What meant <hi>Ioseph</hi> in the beginning of this <hi>Chapter</hi> to add unto his own Envie by reporting his Dreams. The concealment of our hopes and abilities hath not more modesty than safety. He that was envied for his dearness, and hated for his intelligence, was both envied and hated for his Dreams. Surely God meant to make the relation of these Dreams a means to effect that which the Dreams impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. We men work by likely means, God by contraries. The main quarrel was, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this Dreamer cometh!</hi> Had it not been for his Dreams, he had not been sold; if he had not been sold, he had not been exalted. So <hi>Iosephs</hi> state had not deserved envie if his Dreams had not caused him to be envied. Full little did <hi>Ioseph</hi> think when he went to seek his Brethren, that it was the last time he should see his Fathers House. Full little did his Brethren think when they sold him naked to the <hi>Ishmeelites,</hi> to have once seen him in the Throne of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Gods Decree runs on, and while we either think not of it or oppose it, it is performed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. In an honest and obedient simplicity <hi>Ioseph</hi> comes to enquire of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns health, and now may not return to carry news of his own misery: whiles he thinks of their welfare, they are plotting his destruction; <hi>Come, let us slay him.</hi> Who would have expected this cruelty in them which should be the Fathers of Gods Church: he look'd for Brethren, and behold murtherers: every mans tongue, every mans fist was bent against him. Each one strives who shall lay the first hand upon that changeable Coat, that was dyed with their Fathers love, and their envie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 24. It was thought a favour that <hi>Reubens</hi> entreaty obtained for him that he might be cast into the Pit alive to die there. And now they have strip'd him naked, and haling him by both arms as it were, cast him alive into his Grave. So in pretence of forbearance, they resolve to torment him with a lingring Death: the savagest Robbers could not have been more merciless: for now besides (what in them lies) they kill their Father in their Brother. Nature if once degenerate, grows more mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous and extream than a disposition born to cruelty. And now what stranger can think of poor innocent <hi>Ioseph</hi> crying naked in the desolate and dry Pit (only saving that he moistened it with tears) and not be moved? Yet his hard-hearted Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren sit them down carelesly with the noise of his Lamentation in their ears to eat Bread, not once thinking by their own hunger what it was for <hi>Ioseph</hi> to be famished to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 28. Whatsoever they thought, God never meant that <hi>Ioseph</hi> should perish in that Pit; and therefore he sends very <hi>Ishmeelites</hi> to ransom him from his Brethren: the seed of him that persecuted his Brother <hi>Isaac</hi> shall now redeem <hi>Ioseph</hi> from his Brethrens persecution. And now when <hi>Ioseph</hi> had comforted himself with hope of the favour of dying, behold death exchang'd for bondage: how much is servitude to an ingenuous Nature worse than death? For this is common to all, that to none but the miserable. <hi>Iudah</hi> meant this well, but God better. <hi>Reuben</hi> saved him from the Sword, <hi>Iudah</hi> from Famishing: God will ever raise up some favourers to his own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those that are most malicious. How well was this favour bestowed? If <hi>Ioseph</hi> had died for hunger in the Pit, both <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> and all his Brethren had
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36907:33"/>
died for hunger in <hi>Canaan.</hi> Little did the <hi>Ishmeelitish</hi> Merchants know what a treasure they bought, carried, and sold, more precious than all their Balms and Myrrhs. Little did they think that they had in their hands the Lord of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Jewel of the World: why should we contemne any mans meanness, when we know not his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 32. One sin is commonly used for the vail of another: <hi>Iosephs</hi> Coat is sent home dip'd in bloud; that whiles they should hide their own cruelty, they might afflict their Father, no less than their Brother. They have devised this real Lye to punish their old Father for his Love with so grievous a Monument of his sorrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 33. When <hi>Iacob</hi> saw the Coat of his Son <hi>Ioseph, It is my Sons Coat</hi> (saies he) <hi>but an evil Beast hath devoured him:</hi> So Christ will say to us at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, This is the face and figure of a man, but an evil Beast hath devoured my image. The Drunkard hath lost the Image of God, and laid a Swine in the room of it. The Covetous hath lost the Image of God, and laid a ravenous Wolf in the room of it. The Adulterer hath lost the Image of God, and laid a Goat or an Horse in the room of it. The Crafty and Contentious person hath lost the Image of God, and laid a Fox and a Dog in the room of it.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. I Find not many of <hi>Iacobs</hi> Sons more faulty than <hi>Iudah,</hi> who yet is singled out from all the rest to be the royal Progenitor of Christ, and to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the dignity of the Birth-right; that Gods Election might not be of Merit but of Grace: else, howsoever he might have sped alone, <hi>Thamar</hi> had never been joyn'd with him in this line. Even <hi>Iudah</hi> marries a <hi>Canaanite;</hi> it is no marvel though his Seed prosper not: and yet that good Children may not be too much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with their unlawful propagation, the Fathers of the Promised Seed are rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from an Incestuous Bed: <hi>Iudah</hi> was very young, searce from under the rod of his Father, yet he takes no other counsel for his Marriage but from his own eyes, which were like his Sister <hi>Dinahs,</hi> roving and wanton: what better issue could be expected from such beginnings. Those proud Jewes that glory so much in their Pedigree and Name from this Patriarch, may now chuse whether they will have their Mother a <hi>Canaanite</hi> or an Harlot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. Even in wicked and sinful Courses oft-times the birth follows the belly. <hi>Iudahs</hi> eldest Son <hi>Er</hi> is too wicked to live; God strikes him dead ere he can leave any Issue, not abiding any Sience to grow out of so bad a <hi>stock:</hi> notorious sinners God reserves to his own vengeance. He doth not inflict sensible Judgements upon all his enemies, lest the wicked should think there were no punishment abiding for them else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; and again he doth inflict such Judgements upon some, lest he should seem careless of evil. It were as easie for him to strike all dead as one; but he had rather all should be warned by one; and would have his enemies find him merciful, as well as his Children just.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 9. Onan</hi> sees the Judgement of his Brother <hi>Er,</hi> and yet will follow his sins Every little thing discourages us from good, nothing can alter the heart that is set upon evil. <hi>Er</hi> was not worthy of any love; but though he was a miscreant, yet he was a Brother; Seed should have been raised to him; <hi>Onan</hi> justly leeses his life with his seed, which he would rather spill than lend to a wicked Brother. Some duties we owe to humanity, more to neerness of bloud. Ill deservings of others can be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for our injustice, for our uncharitableness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 11. Iudah</hi> hath lost two Sons, and now doth but promise the third, whom he sins in not giving: it is the weakness of Nature rather to hazard a sin than a danger;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36907:33"/>
and to neglect our own duty for wrongful suspition of others: Though he had lost his Son in giving him, yet he should have given him: a faithful mans promise is his debt, which no fear of damage can dispense with. But whereupon was this slackness? <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> fear'd that some unhappiness in the bed of <hi>Thamar</hi> was the cause of his sons mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage; whereas it was their fault, that <hi>Thamar</hi> was both a widdow and childlesse: those that are but the patients of evil, are many times burthened with suspitions; and therefore are ill thought of, because they fare ill: afflictions would not be so heavy if they did not lay us open unto uncharitable conceits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. Now <hi>Thamar</hi> seeks by subtilty that which she could not have by award of justice; the neglect of due retributes drives men to indirect courses; neither know I whether they sin more in righting themselves wrongfully, or the other in not righting them. She therefore takes upon her the habit of an harlot, that she might perform the act. If she had not wish'd to seem a whore, she had not worn that attire, nor chosen that place. Immodesty of outward fashion or gesture bewraies evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires: the heart that meanes well will never wish to seem ill; for commonly we affect to shew better then we are: many harlots will put on the semblances of Chastity, of modesty, never the contrary. It is no trusting those which doe not wish to appear good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers. 15. Iudah</hi> esteems her by her habit, and now the life of an harlot had stir'd up in him a thought of lust; Sathan finds well that a fit object is half a victory: Who would not be asham'd to see a Son of <hi>Iacob</hi> thus transported with filthy affections? At the first sight he is inflamed, neither yet did he see the face of her whom he lusted after. It was motive enough to him that she was a woman; neither could the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his neighbour the Adullamite compose those wicked thoughts, or hinder his unchast acts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 20. That sin must needs be impudent that can abide a witness: yea so hath his lust besotted him, that he cannot discern the voice of <hi>Thamar,</hi> that he cannot fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see the danger of his shame in parting with such Pledges; there is no passion which doth not for a time bereave a man of himself. <hi>Thamar</hi> had learn'd not to trust him without a pawn; he had promised his Son to her as a Daughter, and fail'd, now he promised a Kid to her as an harlot, and performeth it: Whether his pledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd him or the power of his word, I enquire not: Many are faithful in all things save those that are the greatest and dearest: If his credit had been as much endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in the former promise, he had kept it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 23. Now <hi>Thamar</hi> hath requited <hi>Iudah,</hi> She expected long the enjoying of his promised Son, and he performed not; but here he performes the promise of the Kid, and she stayes not to expect it. <hi>Iudah</hi> is sorry that he cannot pay the hire of his lust, and now feareth least he should be beaten with his own staffe, least his Signet should be used to confirm and seal his reproach, resolving not to know them, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing they were unknown of others. Shame is the easiest wages of sin, and the surest, which ever begins first in our selves. Nature is not more forward to commit sin, then willing to hide it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 24. Three months hath <hi>Iudahs</hi> sin slept, and now when he is securest, it awakes and bates him. News is brought him, that <hi>Thamar</hi> begins to swell with her concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and now he swels with rage, and cals her forth to the flame like a rigorous Judge, without so much as staying for the time of her deliverance; that his cruelty in this justice should be no lesse ill, then the injustice of occasioning it. If <hi>Iudah</hi> had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten his sin, his pitty had been more then his hatred to this of his Daughters: how easie is it to detest those sins in others which we flatter in our selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers. 26. Thamar</hi> did not deny the sin nor refuse the punishment, but cals for that partner in her punishment which was her partner in the sin: The Staffe, the Signet and the Handkerchief accuse and convince <hi>Iudah;</hi> and now he blushes at his own sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, much more at his act; and cries out, <hi>She is more righteous then I.</hi> God will find a time to bring his Children upon their knees, and to wring from them penitent confessions: and rather then he will not have them soundly ashamed, he will make
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36907:34"/>
them the Trumpets of their own reproach. Yet doth he not offer himself to the flame with her, but rather excuses her by himself. This relenting in his own case shamed his former zeal. Even in the best men nature is partiall to its self: it is good so to sentence others frailties that yet we remember our own, whether those that have been or may be.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. HE that is mourned for in <hi>Canaan</hi> as dead, prospers in <hi>Egypt</hi> under <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar,</hi> and of a slave is made a Ruler. Thus God meant to prepare him for a greater charge, he must first rule <hi>Potiphars</hi> house then <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Kingdom: his own service is his least good; for his very presence procures a common blessing: a whole family shall fare the better, for one <hi>Joseph.</hi> And thus houses and citties and nations are blessed for the righteous sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 7. Josephs</hi> vertue was not looked upon alike by all eyes: his fellowes praise him, his Master trusts him, his Mistresse affects him too much: <hi>prima adulteri ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum tela sunt secunda verborum,</hi> first she casts her eyes upon him and then sollicits him, all the spite of his brethren was not so great a cross to him as the inordinate affections of his Mistresse. Temptations on the right hand are now more perillous and hard to resist by how much they are more plausible and glorious. But the heart that is bent upon God knowes how to walke steadily and indifferently between the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of sin and the fears of evill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 9. Joseph</hi> saw this pleasure would advance him, he knew what it was to be a Minion of one of the greatest Ladies in Egypt, yet resolves to Contemne it. A good heart will rather lie in the dust then rise by wickednesse: how shall I do this and sin against God. He knew that all the honours of Egypt could not buy off the guilt of one sin, and therefore abhors not onely her bed but her company. He that will be safe from the acts of evill must wisely avoid the occasions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. If the Devil meet thee in an object of temptation as the Devill met <hi>Joseph</hi> in <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife, yet if thou doest not adhere to this Devil, dwel upon a delightful meditation of that sin; if thou doest not fuel and foment that sin, assist and encourage that sin by high diet, wanton discourse, other provocation; if thou with <hi>Ioseph</hi> here doest throw away these garments of thy sin, the clothes that keeps thy sin warm, thou shalt have reason on thy side, and thou shalt have grace on thy side, and thou shalt have the history of a thousand that have perished by that sin on thy side; even Spittles will give thee souldiers to fight for thee by their miserable example against that sin; nay perchance sometimes the vertue of that woman whom thou dost sollicit will assist thee, and by these and such like helps and assistances thou shalt be able to fly from that sin, that Devill, that did pursue thee, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> did from <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. This is the second time that <hi>Ioseph</hi> was stript of his garment; before in the violence of envy, now of lust; before of necessity, now of choice; before to deceive his Father, now his Master; for behold the pledge of his fidelity which he left in those wicked hands is made an evidence against him of that which he refused to doe: therefore did he leave his cloak because he would not do that which he is accused and comdemned because he left it: what safety is there against great adverseries, when even arguments of innocence are used to convince of evill. Lust yeelded unto is a pleasant madness; but it is a disperate madness, when it is opposed. No hatred burns so furiously as that which ariseth from the quenched coals of love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 19. Potiphar</hi> was here too credulous, and before he examined <hi>Ioseph</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns him. It was therefore a very good rule of <hi>Epicharmus,</hi> be not light of beleife, try before you trust, hear both parties before you condemne either. Wisdome would
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36907:34"/>
that as men should not be over censorious; (this man blasphemeth say they of our Saviour) so neither over credulous as the giddy headed <hi>Galatians</hi> were to their sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Doctors, <hi>I wonder that ye are so soon removed,</hi> Gal. 1. 6. It is a singular folly to take mens bare authority as in matters of Fact (with <hi>Potiphar</hi> here) so in matters of faith (with the <hi>Galatians</hi> there.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. Doubtless <hi>Ioseph</hi> denyed the fact, but he dare not accuse the offender: there is not onely the praise of patience but oft-times of wisedome in unjust suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: he knew that God would find a time to clear his innocence and to regard his chast faithfulness. And now no-prison would serve him but <hi>Pharaohs. Ioseph</hi> had lain obscure and not been known unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> if he had not been cast into <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> dungeon: the afflictions of Gods Chrildren turn ever to their advantages. For no sooner was <hi>Ioseph</hi> a prisoner, then (as we read in the next verses) a Guardian of the prisoners. Trust and honour accompany him wheresoever he is, in his Fathers house, in <hi>Potiphars,</hi> in the Jayl, in the Court, still he hath both favour and rule.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. FIrst see here the slippery estate of Courtiers, to day in favour, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in disgrace: hence the <hi>Turks</hi> have a proverb, that great men are but Statues of glasse; and <hi>Plutarch</hi> wittily compareth great men to Counters, which now stand for a thousand pounds, and anon for a farthing. Secondly, whereas the second verse tels us that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was wroth, and this third verse, that he clapt the Baker and Butler in prison without any examination so farre as we read; this will teach us that anger is an ill counsellour; and as smoke in a mans eyes hindreth sight, so doth rash anger the use of reason. It is reported of <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> that vexed with his Cup-bearers stubbornness, he drew his dagger and run after him, but before he came at him he threw away his dagger, lest he should catch him and kill him in the heat of his anger: an example to be followed by all Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. Dreames are either naturall or supernatural. Naturall dreams are not much to be regarded. Diviners and dreamers we are forbid to hearken unto, <hi>Ier.</hi> 27. 9. that use there is of them in Physick to discern our temperatures, in divinity our beloved sins. Supernatural dreames are sent by God and his Angels; and that either to comfort us, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 19. or to chasten us, and fright us as here. Such fearful dreames cause a bad sleep and a worse waking. And therefore, <hi>Job</hi> in his 7 chap. and 15. verse, made choice of strangling rather than such dreams. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> tels us, that many have been so afrighted with dreames and apparitions, that they have hanged themselves, leaped into deep pits, or other wise made themselves away. Let those that either have not been so terrified, or so tempted, or so deserted of God, blesse him for that mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. It is just in the Sacrament as it was in the dreames of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Butler. <hi>The clusters of the Vine brought forth ripe Grapes and</hi> Pharaohs <hi>cup was in his hand,</hi> and the Butler took the Grapes and press'd them into <hi>Pharaohs</hi> cup. The Sacrament is as a Vine set before us, full of clusters of ripe Grapes, and these Grapes full of juyce, Christ with all his fulness offered to us in the Sacrament. Now our care and course should be to have the liquor and bloud of these Grapes poured into the cup of our hearts. How may that be done now? as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> cup came full'd; he took the Grapes &amp; press'd them &amp; crushed them into <hi>Pharaohs</hi> cup, &amp; so the cup was fill'd. So must we take these Grapes and press and crush them, we must squeeze forth the liquor of them. That we do when faith is actuated and is set on worke in the use of the Sacrament: Actuated faith takes these Grapes and presses them, and wrings out of the Sacrament that which fills our hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 13. Pharaohs</hi> Butler and his Baker went both out of prison in a day; and in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36907:35"/>
both cases <hi>Ioseph</hi> in the interpretation of their dreames cals that (their very discharge out of prison) a lifting up of their heads, a kind of preferment: death raises every man alike so far as that it delivers every man from his prison, from the incumbrances of his body; both Baker and Butler were delivered of their prison, but they passed into diverse states after, one to the restitution of his place, the other to an ignominious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. Of thy prison thou shalt be delivered; whether thou wilt or no thou must die: fool this night thy soul may be take from thee; and then what thou shalt be to morrow prophecy upon thy self by that which thou hast done to day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. He desired an interpretation of his dream; not because he had a mind to be instructed thereby, but for that he expected some good as well as the Butler: so some have a regard to the preaching of the word, not for conscience sake, but onely seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby their own ends, which if they misse they goe away as the young man in the Gospel, sad, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 23. The Cup-bearer here admires <hi>Ioseph</hi> in the Jayle, but forgets him in the Court: how easily doth our own prosperity make us both forget the deservings and miseries of others. But as God cannot forget his own, so lest of all in their sorrowes. For after two years more of <hi>Iosephs</hi> patience, that God which caused him to be lifted out of the former pit to be sold, did call him out of the dungeon to honour, and of a miserable Prisoner made him Ruler of <hi>Egypt.</hi> How happy is it with good men that they have a God to remember them, when they are forgotten of the World.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. SO long as God is with <hi>Ioseph</hi> he cannot but shine in spite of men: the wals of that dungeon cannot hide his vertues, the Irons cannot hold them. <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Officers are sent to witness his graces, which he may not come forth to shew without a Miracle: for God now puts a dream into the head of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> he puts the remembrance of <hi>Iosephs</hi> skill into the head of the Cup-bearer, who to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <hi>Pharaoh</hi> not to requite <hi>Ioseph,</hi> commends the Prisoner for an Interpreter: he puts an interpretation into the mouth of <hi>Ioseph;</hi> he puts this choice into the heart of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> of a miserable Prisoner to make him the Ruler of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 35. When we have enough for to day, it is but honest prudence to lay up for to morrow. The poor contemptible Ant gathereth that food in harvest that may serve her for the Winter. It is good for a man to keep somewhat by him, to have something in store against a rainy day. A good saver makes a well doer; is a Dutch proverbe. Care must be taken that our layings out be not more than our layings up. Let no man here object that of our Saviour, <hi>Care not for to morrow:</hi> there is a care of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and a care of diffidence, a care of the head, and a care of the heart; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is needfull, the latter sinfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 40. Worldly men may advance, dignify, and honour Gods People; and yet not love them as godly men should be loved. Besides Gods sanctfying Graces, there are oft-times in Gods Children (as here in <hi>Ioseph)</hi> other gifts of wisdome, prudence, learning, fidelity, skill and activity in secular imployments: all which may gain them great respect in other mens hearts. So <hi>Pharaoh</hi> here honoured <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and we see his ground in the foregoing verse. So many a master loves a godly Servant, not because he is a good man, but because he is a good Servant: this is selflove, they love them because they love themselves; such men are for their profit and advantage, and for their turnes; and therefore out of a selflove &amp; selfrespect, love and respect them. That their love of them is not for their godliness appears by this, because though there were not one dram of grace and godliness in them, yet for their other abilites they should be no lesse dear unto them then now they are with all their graces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 44. Behold how one hour hath changed <hi>Iosephs</hi> Fetters into a chain of Gold,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36907:35"/>
his Rags into fine Linnen, his Stocks into a Chariot, his Jayl into a Palace, <hi>Potiphars</hi> Captive into his Masters Lord. He whose Chastity refused the wanton allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Wife of <hi>Potiphar,</hi> hath now given him to his Wife the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Potipherah.</hi> Humility goes before Honour, serving and suffering are the best Tutors to Government. How well are Gods Children paid for their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; how happy are the Issues of the Faithful! never any man repented him of the advancement of a good Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 46. There is mention made here of <hi>Iosephs</hi> age: first, that by this it may be gathered how long <hi>Ioseph</hi> was a Servant in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Secondly, his age is expressed, that it might appear what wonderful Graces he had received at those years, of Chastity, Patience, Wisdome, Policy, and Government. Thirdly, by this President of <hi>Ioseph</hi> made a Governour at thirty, we see that at this age a man is fit for publick imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>David</hi> at that age began to reign, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> prophesied, <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> began to preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 56. Pharaoh</hi> hath not more preferr'd <hi>Ioseph,</hi> then <hi>Ioseph</hi> hath enrich'd <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh:</hi> If <hi>Ioseph</hi> had not ruled, <hi>Egypt</hi> and all the bordering Nations had perished. The providence of so faithful an Officer hath both given the <hi>Egyptians</hi> their lives; and the Money, Cattle, Bodies, Lands of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Both have reason to be well pleased, the Subjects owe to him their Lives; the King his Subjects and his Dominions: The Bounty of God made <hi>Ioseph</hi> give more than he received. It is like the seven years of plenty were not confin'd to <hi>Egypt;</hi> other Countries ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning were no less fruitful: yet in the seven yeares of famine <hi>Egypt</hi> had Corn when they wanted. See the difference betwixt a wise prudent frugality, and a vain ignorant expence of the benefits of God. The sparing hand is both full and beneficial, whereas the lavish is not only empty but injurious.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. GOod <hi>Iacob</hi> is pinched with the common famine. No piety can exempt us from the evils of neighbourhood. No man can tell by outward events which is the Patriarch and which the Canaanite. Neither doth his profession lead him to the hope of a miraculous preservation. It is a vain tempting of God, to cast our selves upon an immediate provision, with neglect of common meanes: His ten Sons must now leave their Flocks, and goe down into <hi>Egypt</hi> to be their Fathers Purveyors. And now they goe to buy of him whom they had sold, and bow their knees to him for his releif, which had bowed to them before for his own life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 9. It was no small joy to <hi>Ioseph</hi> to see this late accomplishment of his antient dreames, to see the Suppliants (I know not whether more brethren or enemies) groveling before him in an unknown submission. He that was hated of his Brethren for being his Fathers Spie, now accuses his brethren for common Spies of the weakness of <hi>Egypt.</hi> He could not without their suspition have come to a perfect intelligence of his Fathers estate and theirs, if he had not objected to them that which was not. It is more safe in cases of inquisition to fetch farre about; and it is wisdom sometimes to conceal our knowledge that we may not prejudice truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. It now doth <hi>Ioseph</hi> good to seem merciless to his Brethren, whom he had found wilfully cruel; to hide his love from them, which had shewed their hate to him; and to think how much he favoured them, and how little they knew it. And as sporting himself with their present misery, he pleasantly imitates all those actions reciprocally unto them, which they in despite and earnest had done formerly to him; he speaks roughly, rejects their perswasions, puts them in hold, and one of them in bonds. The mind must not alwayes be judged by the outward face of actions. Gods countenance is oft-times severe, and his hand heavy, to them whom he best loves: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a one, under the habit of an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> hath the heart of an <hi>Israelite:</hi> And here
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:36907:36"/>
that <hi>Ioseph</hi> might seem enough (and indeed too much) an Egyptian, <hi>Ioseph</hi> swears heathenishly: How little could his Brethren suspect, that this oath could proceed from the Son of him that swore by the fear of his Father <hi>Isaac?</hi> How oft have sinister respects drawn weak goodness to disguise its self even with sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 18. The onely best curbe to restrain from evil, and spur to incite to good, is the fear of God. All honesty flowes from this holy fear. And therefore it is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> why men are credited more than other creatures, the answer is, Man only reverenceth God, therefore you may trust him, therefore you may commit your self to him. He that truly feareth God is like unto <hi>Cato,</hi> of whom it is said, he never did well that he might appear to do so, but because he could do no otherwise. You need not fear me, said <hi>Ioseph,</hi> here to his Brethren, for I fear God, and so dare do ye no hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse.</hi> 21. As they formerly hardened their hearts against the pittiful complaint of their Brother <hi>Ioseph;</hi> so they confess to be just, that now their suit and petition was not heard: And then in that they said one to another, we have verily sinned, we see the admirable effect of affliction, which brings a man to the knowledge of his sin, and so to repentance: And further when they came to this repentance, none of them transferres the sin from himself, neither doth any of them discharge any of the rest of that sin; they all take all; they say one to another, we, all we, are verily guilty, and therefore is this distress come upon us, upon us all: National calamities are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by general sins; and where they fall, we cannot so charge the Laity as to free the Clergy; nor so charge the People as to free the Magistrate. Let us therefore never say that it is <hi>aliena ambitio,</hi> the immoderate ambition of a pretending Monarch that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers us; that it is <hi>aliena perfidia,</hi> the falsehood of perfidious Neighbours that hath disappointed us; that it is <hi>aliena fortuna,</hi> the growth of others who have shot up under our shelter that doth overtop us; they are <hi>peccata nostra,</hi> our own pride, our own wantonness, our own drunkenness, that makes God shut and close his hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us, withdraw his former blessings from us, and then strike us with that shut, and clos'd, and heavy hand, and multiply calamities upon us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 24. No Song could be so delightful unto <hi>Ioseph,</hi> as to hear them in a late remorse condemn themselves before him of their old cruelty towards him, who was now their unknown Witness and Judge. They had heard <hi>Iosephs</hi> deprecation of their evil with tears, and had not pittied him; yet <hi>Ioseph</hi> doth but hear their mention of this evil which they had done against him, and pitties them with tears: He weeps for joy to see their repentance, and to compare his safety and happiness with the cruelty which they intended, and did, and thought they had done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 28. Simeon</hi> is left in pawn, in Fetters; while the rest of <hi>Iacobs</hi> Sons return with their Corn, with their paying nothing for their Provision but their labour; that they might be as much troubled with the beneficence of that strange <hi>Egyptian</hi> Lord, as before with his imperious suspition. Their wealth was now more irksome to them than their need: And they fear God means to punish them more in this super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of Money than in the want of Victuals, <hi>(What is this that God hath done to us?)</hi> It is a wise course to be jealous of our gain, and more to fear than to desire abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 38. All temporal things are troublesome: if they be good, it is trouble to forgoe them; and when we see that they must be parted with, either we wish that they had not been so good, or that we had never enjoyed them; as some did of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> when he died: If they be evil, their presence is troublesome; and still we wish, either that they were good, or that we were eased of them. Good things are troublesome in the event, and evil things in the use; they in the future, because they shall come to an end, these in the present, because they doe continue. Oh that men would look to things that are eternal, for they are good here, and will be better here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. THis Land where the Famine now was, was <hi>Canaan,</hi> Gods own Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the Land which he had promised should flow with Milk and Hony, yet here was a Famine, and at that time when his own Children, his <hi>Israel,</hi> and the first the very best of those Children dwelt in the Land. Gods own People must want when his Enemies the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had enough and to spare. From whence we may learn, that neither Gods Love, nor his disaffection is to be judged by the things of this world: Outward appearance is an ill signe to try the favours of God by; for his Face, his outward appearance was most grim, most severe against his own Son; our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who drunk a more bitter Cup from the hand of his Father (against which he prayed, <hi>Father, if it be possible let this Cup passe from me)</hi> than that of Gall and Vinegar, which was offered him by the <hi>Iews.</hi> Let therefore the wicked, the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> the Enemies of Gods Church, how prosperous, how secure, how plentiful soever their condition may seem to be in this life, remember this in the midst of their jollity; that their Master the Devil gives them pleasant entrances into his wayes, but reserves the bitterness for the end; we may say of their plenty as we use to say of some ill ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted meat or drink, the prosperity of the wicked hath a scurvy tang with it, an ill come off. On the other side let Gods <hi>Israel,</hi> his Children, how sad, how dejected, how much soever in want they seem to be, remember this in the midst of their misery, that though the first handsel that God gives them in the Land of Promise be a Famine, yet in the end they shall overflow with the Milk and Honey of <hi>Canaan.</hi>

                  <hi>Verse 3. Benjamin</hi> was the beloved Son of his Father, and so is <hi>Christ;</hi> no seeing the face of God unlesse we bring our <hi>Benjamin,</hi> our beloved Brother along with us. And therefore whatever entercourse we have with God, we must have Christ with us. We must not offer Sacrifice without the High-Priest; Let us offer nothing to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ: There is no appearing before God, no commerce between God and us untll we be reconciled in Christ, in whom we must offer all our Sacrifices and endeavours. We must not then own an absolute God in our devotions, we must not think of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any addresses to God, but as he is reconciled in Christ, and at peace with us in Christ, and so our Persons, and Prayers, and all shall be accepted in the Person of Christ, who is the true Mercy-seat, the beloved <hi>Benjamine,</hi> in looking upon whom God frees us from the curse of the Law.</p>

                  <hi>Verse 9. Christ</hi> descended lineally from <hi>Iudah,</hi> who in this particular of suretiship was a type of <hi>Christ:</hi> For as <hi>Iudah</hi> here did engage to his Father <hi>Iacob</hi> for his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Benjamin,</hi> so did our blessed Saviour to his Father for us, and was our Security for the payment both of our debt and duty, both for our sins and our obedience. And as Christ was our Surety to God for the discharge of our debt (the Security and Debtor in Law are reputed as one Person) so he is Gods Surety to us for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his Promises. <hi>Christ</hi> was the Surety of the first Covenant to pay that debt, of the second Covenant to perform the Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. Old <hi>Iacob</hi> that was not used to simple and absolute Contentments, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the blessing of seasonable provision, together with the affliction of that heavy message, the losse of one Son, and the danger of another; and knows not whether it be better for him to die with hunger, or with grief for the departure of that Son of his right hand. He drives off all till the last; protraction is a kind of ease in evils that must come. At length (as no plea is so importunate as that of Famine) <hi>Benjamin</hi> must goe; one evil must be hazarded for the redress of another. What would it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail him to see whom he loved miserable? How injurious were the affection to keep his Son so long in his eye, till they should see each other die for hunger. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ten Brothers doe now return into <hi>Egypt</hi> with double money in their Sacks, and a Present in their hands; the danger of mistaking is required by honest minds with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36907:37"/>
more than restitution. It is not enough to find out our own hearts clear in suspicious actions, except we satisfie others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. If this were an oversight, then restitution was necessary; we must not any wayes defraud or over-reach our Brother. <hi>Whatever you would that men should doe unto you, so doe unto them,</hi> said our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 12. If we would not have others wrong us, why should we wrong them, that former saying of <hi>Christs</hi> must be the general rule of direction in common conversation and mutual interdealings one with another. That is the royal Law, the Standard of all equity in this kind, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which we must converse with all men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 23. Iosephs</hi> Steward would never have spoken so reverently of the God of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but that he was so taught of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who was careful to instruct his family in the right way. So did <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18. 18. and <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 34, and so should we.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 34. Now hath <hi>Ioseph</hi> what he would, the sight and presence of his <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> whom he therefore borrows of his Father for a time, that he might return him with a greater interest of joy. And now he feasts them whom he formerly threatned, and turns their fear into wonder: all unequal love is not partial; all the Brethren are entertained bountifully, but <hi>Benjamin</hi> hath a fivefold portion: By how much his welcome was greater, by so much his pretended theft seem'd more hainous: For good turns aggravate unkindnesses, and our offences are increas'd with our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. FIll the mens sacks with food as much as they can carry, said <hi>Ioseph</hi> here to his Steward; look how they came prepared with sacks and Beasts, so they were sent back with Corn; the greater and the more sacks they had prepared, the more Corn they carried away; if they had prepared but small sacks and a few, they had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away the lesse. A prepared heart is a vessel that shall be fill'd at a Sermon or the Sacrament. Now the more or lesse the heart is prepared, the greater or lesser the vessel, according to the size and capacity of the vessel shall it be fill'd. Fill such mens hearts with special blessings, with vertue from Christ, with the comfort of the holy Ghost, sayes the Lord at a Sermon, or the Sacrament; fill them with special food as full as they can hold, as much as they can carry. Let us be careful to prepare our hearts to the purpose. The larger is our preparation, the larger is our vessel; the larger our vessel, the larger our dole at a Sermon or Sacrament. If we carry not away as much as we would it is our own fault, that by preparation we did not furnish our selves with a larger vessel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. This blind Nature saw to be the sum of all sins, <hi>ingratum dixeris, omnia dixeris.</hi> Some vices are such as Nature smiles upon, though frown'd at by Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, not so this. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> caused a Souldier of his that had offered unkindness to one that had kindly entertained him, to be branded in the forehead with these two words, <hi>hospes ingratus.</hi> Unthankfulnesse is a Monster in Nature, a Solecisme in Manners, a Paradox in Divinity, a parching Wind to dry up the Fountain of further favour. <hi>Benjamins</hi> fivefold Messe was no small aggravation to the theft here laid to his charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. The Graces which God finds in us are like the silver which <hi>Ioseph</hi> found in <hi>Benjamins</hi> sack, of his own putting in. For our will herein is like the lower Sphere, <hi>quae non nisi mota movet,</hi> moves not unlesse it be first moved. Why should we then be loth to acknowledge to have all our ability of doing good freely from God, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his grace, when as even those faculties of Nature, by which we pretend to doe the offices of Grace, we have from God himself too. For that question of the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36907:37"/>
all, What hast thou that thou hast not received? Thy natural faculties are no more thine own, than the Grace of God is thine own. But as thy body conceived in thy Mothers womb could not claim a soul at Gods hand, nor wish a soul, no nor know there was a soul to be had: so neither by being a man indued with natural faculties canst thou claim Grace, or wish Grace; nay those natural faculties, if they be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tincted with some infusion of Grace before, cannot make thee know what Grace is, or that Grace is. To a Child rightly disposed in the womb God does give a soul; to a natural man rightly disposed in his natural faculties God doth give grace, but that soul was not due to that Child, nor that grace to that Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 14. If I am bereaved of my Children</hi> (saith <hi>Iacob</hi> here) <hi>I am bereaved.</hi> Which was spoken by him, not rashly or desperately, as if he cared not what became of himself, but through the obedience of Faith in sacrificing his will unto Gods. And this is according to that Petition in the Lords Prayer, <hi>Thy will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> A godly Man sayes <hi>Amen</hi> to Gods <hi>Amen,</hi> and puts his <hi>fiat</hi> and <hi>placet</hi> to Gods: As one said, He could have what he would of God. Why? How was that? Because whatever was Gods will, that was his. And thus to submit unto Gods will is to serve him with a true heart, a heart truly and entirely given up to God, delighting to doe his will, and therefore well content to wait, or, if God see good, to want what it most desires, be it Health, or Wealth, or Wife or Children; being ambitious rather that Gods will should be done than our own, and that he may be glorified though we be not gratified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. This iniquity which God is said here to find out, is not to be referred to this present Accusation, whereof they were not guilty but to their former trespass committed against <hi>Ioseph,</hi> as they in like manner confessed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. and by this we should learn to look to God in our afflictions, whereof we see no evident cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. How easie is it to find advantages where there is a purpose to accuse? <hi>Benjamins</hi> sack makes him guilty of that whereof his heart was free. Crimes seem strange to the innocent; well might they abjure this fact with the offer of bondage and death: For they which carefully brought again that which they might have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, would never take that which was not given them. But thus <hi>Ioseph</hi> would yet dally with his Brethren, and make <hi>Benjamin</hi> a Theif that he might make him a Servant, and fright his Brethren with the peril of that their charge, that he might double their joy and amazedness, in giving them two Brothers at once: Our happiness is greater and sweeter when we have well fear'd and smarted with evils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 23. Iosephs</hi> Steward like a good Man speaks comfort and life unto these fainting dis-spirited Patriarkes: He knew there was a warre in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and therefore he brings peace unto their afflicted spirits. To break the bruised reed, to greive one that is in the agony of his soul, to strike the breath out of a mans body who is giving up the Ghost, is cruelty upon cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. And therefore it was the complaint of Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> against the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Christians in his time, <hi>In servis Dei non torquebantur membra sed vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera,</hi> they laid stripes upon stripes, and laid wounds upon sores, and tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured not so much the members of Gods Servants, as their bleeding wounds.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. VVHen <hi>Iudah</hi> had seriously reported the danger of his old Father, and the sadness of his last complaint, compassion and joy will be conceal'd no longer, but break forth violently at <hi>Iosephs</hi> voice and eyes. Many passions do not well abide witnesses because they are guilty to their own weakness. <hi>Ioseph</hi> sends forth his servants that he might freely weep. He knew he could not say I am <hi>Ioseph</hi> without an unbeseeming vehemence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 4. I am Ioseph:</hi> never any word sounded so strangely as this in the ears of the Patriarkes. Wonder, doubt, reverence, joy, fear, guiltiness, struck them at once. No marvel if they stood with paleness and silence before him; looking on him and on each other: the more they considered, the more they wondred; and the more they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived, the more they feared. For those words, <hi>I am Ioseph,</hi> seemed to sound thus much to their guilty thoughts; you are murtherers, and I am a Prince in spite of you: my power and this place give me all opprotunities of revenge; my glory is your shame, my life your danger, your sin lives together with me. But now the tears and graicous words of <hi>Ioseph</hi> have soon assured them of pardon and love, and have bidden them turn their eyes from their sin against their brother, to their happiness in him, and have changed their doubts into hopes, and joyes. Thus actions salv'd up with a free forgiveness are as not done; and as a bone once broken is stronger after well setting; so is love after reconcilement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. Let us remember this in all oppressions we meet with, that they fall not upon us without divine providence. What <hi>Eliphaz</hi> saith of affliction in general, is true of oppression in particular, <hi>it comes not forth of the dust, neither doth it spring out of the ground.</hi> And this truth was confirmed by <hi>Ioseph</hi> in this text; who though sold by his envious brethren into <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet saith, that God had sent him into <hi>Egypt. David</hi> being rail'd upon by <hi>Shimei,</hi> said, God had bid him curse; and <hi>Iob</hi> being robbed by the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> said, God had taken away: thus also concerning the <hi>Iserae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> bondage under the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the Psalmist saith he turned their heart to hate his people, and deal subtilly with his servants. Let us not therefore with the foolish dog, bark at the stone, but rather look at the hand acknowledging God in all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. God so orders and disposeth the actions of men as seems best for his glory: as <hi>Ioseph</hi> spake here to his Brethren, when he discovered himself to them in <hi>Egypt,</hi> whether they had betraied and sold him; <hi>now it was not you that sent me hither but God:</hi> they sent him thither instrumentally &amp; enviously, but it was God that sent him thither providentially and graciously; it was his power and wisedome which ordered that dispensation sweetly, else his Brethren had made foul work of it; or they sent him thither to make him a slave that was their designe, but God sent him thither to make him a Prince and Ruler, to make him a Preserver of <hi>Egypt</hi> and of his own family too, as he speaks at the end of this verse, he hath made me a Father to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and Lord of all his house, and a Ruler throughout all the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. Although the fift Commandement was not then writ in stone, yet it was sufficiently engraved on the Table of <hi>Iosephs</hi> heart, <hi>honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> and surely one part of his honour is to provide for them in case of want, which was <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi> particular care in this text, to nourish and cherish his father as a man nourisheth his little ones, saith the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> lovingly and tenderly. This the Apostle commends to us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 4. as a thing not only good before men but acceptable before God. <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi> rejoyc'd in nothing more then that he had lived to cheer up the hearts of his aged Parents by the reports of his victories. <hi>Aristotle cap. 6. de mundo,</hi> tells us that when from the hill <hi>Etna</hi> there run down a current of fire that consumed all the houses thereabouts; in the midst of those fearful flames the River of fire parted its self, and made a kind of lane for those who ventured to rescue their aged Parents out of the jawes of death.</p>

                  <hi>Verse 21. Ioseph</hi> is here as bountifull as his Brethren were formerly cruel. They send him naked to strangers, he sends them in new and rich liveries to their father; they tooke a small sum of money for him, he gives them great treasures; they sent his torne coat to his father; he sends variety of costly raiment to his father by them; they sold him to be the load of Camels, he sends them home with Chariots. It must be a great favour that can appease the conscience of a great injury. Now they return home rich and joyful, making themselves happy to think how glad they should make their father with this newes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 26. Good old <hi>Iacob</hi> did never hope that <hi>Egypt</hi> should have afforded such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision as this, <hi>Ioseph is yet alive:</hi> this was not food but life to him. The return of <hi>Benjamin</hi> was comfortable; but that his dead son was yet alive after so many yeares lamentation was tydings too happy to be believed, and was enough to endanger that life with excesse of joy which the knowledge thereof doubled. Over excellent objects are dangerous in their sudden aprehensions. One grain of that joy would have safely cheer'd him, whereof a full measure overlayes his heart with too much sweetness. There is no earthly pleasure where of we may not surfeit; of the spirituall we can never have enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 28. Iacobs</hi> eyes revive his mind, which his eares had thus astonished. When he saw the Chariots of his son be beleived <hi>Iosephs</hi> life and refreshed his own. He had too much before so that he could not enjoy it: now he saith I have enough, <hi>Ioseph</hi> my son is yet alive: they told him of his honour, he speaks of his life; life is better then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. To have heard that <hi>Ioseph</hi> lived a servant would have joyed him more, then to hear that he died honourably. The greater blessing obscures the less. He is not worthy of honour that is not thankfull for life. Yet <hi>Iosephs</hi> life did not content <hi>Iacob</hi> without his presence <hi>(I will go down and see him ere I die)</hi> the sight of the eye is better then to walke in desires; good things pleasure us not in their being, but in our enjoying. Thus did <hi>Iacob</hi> rejoyce when he was to go out of the land of promise to a forraign Nation for <hi>Iosephs</hi> sake; being glad that he should loose his country for his son. What shall our joy be? who must goe out of this forraign land of our pilgrimage to the home of our glorious inheritance; to dwell with none but our own in that better and more lightsome <hi>Goshen,</hi> free from all the incumbrances of this <hi>Egypt,</hi> and full of all the riches and delights of God.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. GOd hath not used one means alone, but diverse to speak unto the world; either by Angels, or by the cloud, or between the Cherabims, or by Urim, or by Dreams, or by Visions. To this purpose there is a rule set down, <hi>Num.</hi> 12. if there be a Prophet of the Lord among you I will be known to him by a Vision, and will speak to him by a dream; and to this rule we might add sundry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples out of Scripture as of <hi>Iacob</hi> here, of <hi>Samuel,</hi> of <hi>Daniel,</hi> of <hi>Iohn;</hi> all declaring that God used to declare many things by Visions to his Servants, and to others when it pleased him: that so by this means he might have the revelation of his will appear to be onely his, and not of themselves. For however it pleased the Lord to deal with his servants, and what way soever he used to signifie his good pleasure, in all these cases he imprinted in the mindes and hearts of them to whom he shewed himself cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain notes and evident tokens, whereby they might expresly and clearly know that it was his doing, that so they should chalenge nothing to themselves but ascribe all unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. Cause of feare <hi>Iacob</hi> might see sufficient: but God would not have him look downward on the rushing and roaring streams of misery that run so swiftly under him and his posterity, but stedfastly fasten on his power and providence, who
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:36907:39"/>
was his God and the God of his father. He loves to perfect his strength in our weakness: as <hi>Eliah</hi> would have the Sacrifice covered with water that Gods power might the more appear in the fire from heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. God saies to <hi>Iacob</hi> here, I will go down with thee into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and I wil also surely bring thee up again. God goes down with a good man into the grave, and will surely bring him up again. When? the Angel promised to returne to <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> for the assurance of the birth of <hi>Iaac</hi> acording to the time of life, that is, in such time as by nature a Woman may have a child; God will return to us in the grave acording to the time of life; that is, in such time as he by his gracious decree hath fixed for the Resurrection. And in the mean time no more than the God-head departed from the dead body of our Saviour in the grave, doth his power and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence depart from our dead bodies in that darkness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 6. Iacob</hi> being not willing to be a burthen unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> more then needs must, brings down all his Estate into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Though the Famine forced the Patriarch to be beholding to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for bread, yet he would not be Engaged to him for meat. And therefore tooke his Cattle along with him; and although he could not bring down his house into <hi>Goshen,</hi> yet he carried his goods. It is an happiness so to live with others as not to be beholding, but rather helpful than burthensome. When the Prophet desired a cake of the widdow in the dayes of famine, he rewarded her with a barrel of meal, which outlasted that famine, and rather then he will be a burthen to the poor Woman, a miracle shall releive her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 27. Well may the Rabbins say, that these seventy souls were as much as the seventy Nations of the world, when <hi>Moses</hi> tels us <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 22. that whereas their fathers went down into <hi>Egypt</hi> with seventy souls, now <hi>Iehovah</hi> had made them as the Stars of heaven for multitude; and this too by miraculous wayes and means. As for instance, when this <hi>Israel</hi> of God was shackel'd (perchance for their forefathers selling <hi>Ioseph</hi> to be a slave) with the Irons of <hi>Egypt;</hi> where their burthens were turned into bondage, and their bondage into bloud, their souls also being ever on the rack of continuall fear and suspence, lest their bodies might be thrown into the same brickhils they had built, and become the fire to harden their own handiwork; Yet here how did God tie up <hi>Pharaohs</hi> hands with plagues, turning their poisons into cordials, and their enemies malice to their greatest improvement; in that he made them grow under their burthen; and propagate through that inhumane distructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Male fruit of their body. So able is God to raise his Church from a small number to an infinite, from seventy persons to the Stars of heaven, or the sand on the Sea-shore for multitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 29. The height of all earthly contentment appear'd in the meeting of these two; whom their mutual losse had more endear'd to each other. The intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of comforts hath this advantage, that it sweetens our delight more in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, then was abated in the forbearance. God doth oft-times hide away our <hi>Ioseph</hi> for a time, that we may be more joyous and thankfull in his recovery. This was the sincerest pleasure that ever <hi>Iacob</hi> had, which therefore God reserved for his age. And if the meeting of earthly friends be so unspekably comfortable, how happy shall we be in sight of the glorious face of God our heavenly Father, of that our blessed Redeemer; whom we sold to death by our sins, and which now after that noble triumph hath all power given him in Heaven and Earth.</p>

IT is fit that every one that lives in a Common-wealth should labour in that Common-wealth, and bring some benefit, some honey to the common hive, unlesse he will be cast out as a drone. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would hardly have suffered even <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi> own Brethren to have lived idly under his jurisdiction; and therefore his first question here was, <hi>What is your Occupation?</hi> At <hi>Athens</hi> every man gave an yearly account to the Magistrate, by what Trade or course of life he maintained himself; which if he could not doe he was banished. <hi>Take ye the evil and unprofitable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> (said our Saviour) <hi>and cast him into utter darkness;</hi> away with such a fellow from off the earth which he hath burthened; for he is no more missed when gone then the parings of ones nailes. Those therefore that have a talent, a trade to live on, must improve that talent, must follow that trade, whereby the world may be the better, and not think to come hither meerly as Rats and Mice, only to devour victuals, and to run squeaking up and down. These are Ciphers, or rather Excrements in humane Society. <hi>In the sweat of thy brows thou shalt eat thy bread,</hi> was the old Sanction. Even Paradise that was Mans Store-house, was also his working house. They bury them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves alive, that, as body-lice, live on other mens sweat and labours, and it is a sin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. These plain dealing men did not desire to live at Court, though their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the chief Favourite, but in <hi>Goshen;</hi> which as it was next to the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> so was it most fit for their Cattle. These honest religious Patriarks chose rather a poor Shepheards life in Gods service, then to ruffle it as Courtiers out of the Church. So did <hi>Moses</hi> afterwards and <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 84. 10. and the poor Prophet that died so deep in debt, and good <hi>Micaiah,</hi> and those that wandred about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. who happily might have ruffled in silks and velvets if they would have strain'd their Consciences. <hi>Origen</hi> was contented to be a poor Catechist at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> every day in fear of death, when he might have been with his fellow Pupil <hi>Photinus</hi> in great authority and favour, if not a Christian. God takes it kindly when men will goe after him in the Wildernefs, in a Land not sown, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 2. that is, chuse him and his wayes in affliction, and with self-denial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. Those that are ingenious and industrious in their calling, shall be preferred and had in esteem by great men. How much more then doth it concern Christians to improve their Talent, that they may be accepted and preferr'd by God. That Servant in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> that had improved his pound to ten pounds, was made Lord over ten Cities, and he that had encreased it but to five pounds, had authority but over five Cities: As every one had traded so he was rewarded, and had a different degree both of Grace and Glory. Let all men therefore according to their several abilities im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove what they have to Gods Glory and the good of others, and then they may be sure they shall improve it for themselves, and their own both good and glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. Mans life is but a sojourning, it is but a Pilgrimage, said <hi>Iacob</hi> here, and but the dayes of his pilgrimage neither, every one of them quickly at an end, and all of them quickly reckoned. Thus also did the rest of the Patriarchs count themselves but as Strangers and Pilgrims in the earth, and thereby declared that they sought a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Heb. 12. 14. Here we have no continuing City;</hi> first no City, no such large Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then no continuing at all, it is but a sojourning. Here we are but <hi>viatores,</hi> Passengers, Wayfaring men; this life is but the high-way, and thou canst not build thy hopes here; nay to be buried in the high-way is no good mark, and therefore bury not thy self, thy labours, thy affections upon the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. However Infidels and Idolaters were destitute of the knowledge of the true God, yet they accounted it a special duty to honour the Priests of their Groves and Altars, and perswaded themselves that they should never receive any blessing at
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:36907:40"/>
the hands of their Gods, unlesse they honoured those that were esteemed as his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Thus <hi>Moses</hi> witnesseth, that when <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> during the Dearth and Famine that was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> had received all the Money, bought all the Cattle, and purchased all the Land of the People, to supply their necessity and save their lives, yet he would not buy the Priests Land, but sustained them for their Office sake. And are Idolaters and Infidels thus bountiful in the maintaining of their Priests? How then should this serve to reprove our dulness and backwardness in the true worship of the Eternal God. How many are there that live in the bosome of the Church, and profess the true Religion, who yet to maintain a learned Minister, that is able to save their souls, repine and grutch to give sixpence a quarter. What a shame is it for those whom the Lord hath blessed with abundance, that they should spend all on their backs and bellies, on Hawks, or Hounds, or Whores; and nothing at all to the Glory of God, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of their fouls, and help of their Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 28. Just so many years as <hi>Iacob</hi> had nourished <hi>Ioseph</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> did <hi>Ioseph</hi> nourish <hi>Iacob</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> repaying his Fathers love to the utmost penny. These were the sweetest dayes and freest from trouble, that ever the good old Patriark saw. God reserves his best to the last. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist, for</hi> (be his beginning and middle never so troublesome) <hi>the end of that man</hi> (his after-end at least) <hi>shall be peace:</hi> A <hi>Goshen</hi> he shall have either here or in Heaven, and a Peace both in this world and the next; the peace of Conscience here, and the peace that passeth all understanding hereafter.</p>

                  <hi>Verse 1. IAcob have I loved,</hi> said God; and yet this Beloved of God was under many troubles and afflictions in his life, and visited with sickness before his death. And all this doth very well agree with the dispensations of Gods Providence. <hi>For whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourgeth every Son whom he receives.</hi> Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Christs Love-tokens. When <hi>Ignatius</hi> came to the wild Beasts, Now, saith he, I begin to be a Christian. <hi>Omnis Christianus crucianus,</hi> every true Christian must take up his Crosse and follow his Saviour. It is reported of an antient Doctor of the Church, lying upon his sick bed, and being asked how he did, and how he felt himself, he pointed to his Sores and Ulcers (whereof he was full) and said, <hi>Hae sunt gemmae &amp; pretiosa ornamenta Dei,</hi> These are Gods Gems and Jewels, wherewith he decketh his best friends, and to me they are more pretious than all the Gold and Silver in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. It is not enough to relate Gods Mercies to us in the lump, and by whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale, but we must instance in the particulars both to God and men, upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, setting them down one by one, and cyphering them up, as <hi>Davids</hi> word is, <hi>Psal. 9. 1. I will praise thee O Lord, and I will shew forth</hi> (or sum up) <hi>all thy marvellous works.</hi> When <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Exodus</hi> met with his Father in Law, he reckoned all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Mercies that God had done for <hi>Israel,</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and at the Red Sea, he omitted none. The truly thankful keep an Ephemerides, a Calender, and Catalogue of Gods gratious dealings with them, and delight to their last to recount and sum them up. We should be like Civit-boxes, which still retain the scent when the Civit is taken out of them.</p>

                  <hi>Verse 7. Iacob</hi> makes mention of <hi>Rachels</hi> burial, to put <hi>Ioseph</hi> in mind, that <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> forsook her Fathers house to live in <hi>Canaan,</hi> so to stir him up much more to leave <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was not his Country; as also that he might have a greater desire to the place of his Mothers Sepulcher.</p>

                  <hi>Verse 14. Iacob</hi> feeling with his hands which was the Elder and bigger, (for the words are, he caus'd his hands to understand) on purpose laid his right hand on <hi>Ephraim</hi> in way of preheminence; which sheweth that God bestoweth his Gifts without respect of persons, as also it prefigureth the calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> instead of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who were as the elder Brother. 3. From this we may deduce an evident truth in experience, that Gods dispensations towards the Righteous and the Wicked in this life, are like <hi>Iacobs</hi> dealing here with <hi>Iosephs</hi> Sons, crosse and strange: For as he laid his right hand on the Younger, and his left on the Elder, so doth God oft-times, for the present, distribute with his left hand crosses to the good, and with his right favours to the bad: And not only in a literal sense, as our Saviour speaks, <hi>He maketh the Sun to shine, and the Rain to fall upon the just and the unjust,</hi> but in a metaphorical sense he causeth the Sun of Prosperity to shine upon the Unjust, and the Rain of Adversity to fall upon the Just.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. When a Curse fals upon the Children the Father is cursed; as in the Blessing of the Children tht Father is blessed. Thus <hi>Ioseph</hi> brought his two Sons, <hi>Manasseh</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> to his aged Father <hi>Iacob,</hi> that they might receive his Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, who laying his hands upon their heads blessed <hi>Ioseph,</hi> saith the Text, and said, <hi>God before whom,</hi> &amp;c. and then it follows, <hi>The Angel which redeem'd me from all evil, blesse the Lads.</hi> Now as <hi>Iacob</hi> in blessing the Children of <hi>Ioseph</hi> blessed <hi>Ioseph</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; so <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 9. in cursing the Children of <hi>Cham</hi> cursed <hi>Cham</hi> himself. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius</hi> l. 1. hath observed concerning the Tyrant <hi>Dionysius,</hi> that though he escaped free and untouched in person from the vengeance which his sacrilegious wickedness de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, yet his Sons were involved in so much misery, that in them, he being pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> feeling, suffered, and being dead paid dearly for his stolue dainties. The light of Nature as well as Scripture tels us, that evils falling on posterity are reckoned upon the Fathers score. And thus as 'tis with Curses, so likewise with Blessings, upon the same account, and for the same reason, though they are conferr'd upon the Children, yet the Fathers memory is blessed and honoured by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. It is dangerous to follow men blindfold (how seeing soever those men are) but it is safe and our duty to follow God blindfold, how seeing soever we think our selves to be. We must not be displeased as <hi>Ioseph</hi> was here with his Father <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi> When we see God laying his right hand upon <hi>Ephraim;</hi> and his left upon <hi>Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seh</hi> doing things crosse to our thoughts; much lesse may we take upon us to direct the hand of God, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> would <hi>Iacobs,</hi> where we please. The Lord knows, as <hi>Iacob</hi> answered <hi>Ioseph,</hi> what he doth, and it becomes us to acquiess in what he doth, though we know it not. And though God turn Kingdomes upside down, though he send great afflictions upon his own People, and make them a reproach unto the Heathen, though he give them up unto the power of the Adversary, and make all their enemies to rejoyce, yet no man may say unto God, Why doe you thus? his Works are unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. It is beyond the line of the Creature to put any question, a Why or a Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore about thr Work of the Creator. <hi>Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the Clay?</hi>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. This good Patriarch that had before wrestled with an Angel, did not now fear to wrestle with Death; and therefore speaks of it without the least fear or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation of spirit. It was no more betwixt <hi>Iacob</hi> and Death, but, <hi>Behold I die.</hi> He knew he was to change his Place indeed, but not his Company, Death was to him but the day-break of eternal brightness, it was but (as that Martyr said) winking a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and he was in Heaven immediately. Why then should this sad toil of Mortality dishearten us, why should we be so foolish, as to fear that which is the Port which we ought one day to desire, never to refuse. And therefore some have welcom'd Death, some met it in the way, some baffied it in persecution, sickness, torments, knowing it to bethe end of a temporal Misery, and the beginning of an everlasting Joy.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. GOdly men are not at all pleased with the way of the wicked, how much soever they thrive in it. <hi>Iob</hi> had said much of the Greatness, Riches, and Glory of the Wicked, but saith he, <hi>However the counsel of the wicked is farre from me,</hi> Chap. 21. the wayes of the godly and wicked differ as much as their ends; &amp; their counsels are as distant as their conclusions will be. Every good man saith of the counsel and ways of the wicked, how prosperous soever, as <hi>Iacob</hi> said of his Sons, <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Levi, O my soul come not thou into their secret.</hi> Let me be far from their secret, far from their Cabinet Counsel, and close Committees, <hi>O my soul come not thou into their secret. Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly.</hi> The further we keep from their counsel, the nearer we are to blessedness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. Many times Man though forbidden curses, then it is his Sin, and he is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Minister for evil against his Brother. Yet in some cases to curse is Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and our Duty, and then we are Gods Ministers for wrath against the Wicked. Thus when the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> was upon his death-bed, and bed of blessing, yet he pronounced a Curse upon the rage and anger of his two Sons here, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi.</hi> Now in all lawful cursings we must observe these two Rules. First, to aim the Curse at the destruction of the Sin, not the Sinner. Secondly, where the Sinner appears incorrigible, yet to desire the clearing up of Gods Justice in punishing, not the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment its self. To curse any thing or person passionately is infirmity; to curse any thing or person maliciously is grosse impiety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. What difference the Holy Ghost is pleased to put here betwixt sinners, when yet the sins of those men were in a manner equal. <hi>Reubeus</hi> Incest in the fourth verse was punished with a Curse, and the like sin of <hi>Iudahs</hi> is pardoned, and in a sort prospereth. If this sin had not cost <hi>Iudah</hi> many a sigh, he had no more escaped his Fathers Curse, then <hi>Reuben</hi> did. I see the difference not of sins but men: Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on goes not by the measure of the sin, but the quality of the sinner; yea rather the Mercy of the Forgiver. <hi>Blessed is the man</hi> (not that sins not, but) <hi>to whom the Lord imputes not his sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. This Hebrew word <hi>Shilo</hi> is derived from <hi>Shalah,</hi> which signifies secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and safety. So that Christ is <hi>Shilo,</hi> that is, he in whom all persons may securely trust: You may sit down in safety in Christ, and rest your souls for ever; he is <hi>Shilohs</hi> our Lord Protector, our Saviour. And the <hi>Hebrews</hi> use the same word to signifie the fleshly Mantle in which the Infant is wrapped in the Mothers belly, because the Infant lieth there quietly and securely, it is out of fear, and hath no thought of any danger, but lieth securely out of harmes way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. Gods Children upon the discovery of his glory and that happiness of the next Life, are fill'd with longing desires after God and those Enjoyments. <hi>Lord I have waited for thy salvation,</hi> said <hi>Iacob:</hi> he speaks this upon his death-bed, as that he had been looking for all his life; as if that were the account of all his actions in the World, and the Story of his whole Life. <hi>I have longed, for thy salvation,</hi> said <hi>David.</hi> All desires are summ'd up in longing. There is a strong desire in the Saints to see and injoy God in his Ordinances. Now if there be so great and so long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a desire to see the Lord through these <hi>Mediums,</hi> and in these Glasses, how much more to see him immediately face to face? How would that desire swallow up all our desires in glory? And indeed we could not abide in Glory with any other desire but that. The Saints are described in their present state by this Periphrasis, <hi>such as love the appearing of Christ,</hi> as if they loved nothing else. What then will Christ be to them when he shall appear. They who love Christ whom they have not seen, how will they love Christ when they see him.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 23. God sometimes seems an Enemy to his faithful Servants. For one to be before God as a Butt, continually shot at, what other interpretation can sence make of it but this, that God looks upon him as an Enemy. <hi>Iacob</hi> said of <hi>Ioseph</hi> here, <hi>The Archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him. Ioseph</hi> was the common Mark of his Brethrens Envy. But in this case, as it is said of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> when his Brethren came to him he made himself strange to them: <hi>Ioseph</hi> was of a meek and loving dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and therefore like a Player upon a Stage he only acted the part of a rigid Master or Governour; thus many times the Lord takes upon him the posture of an Enemy, and forces a frown upon a poor Creature, whom he loves and delights in with all his heart; he makes him as his Mark to shoot at, whom he layes next to his heart. Besides, observe from hence further, that God takes the most eminent and choisest of his Servants for the choisest and most eminent afflictions. Thus <hi>Ioseph</hi> was made the White here that the Archers shot at. <hi>Ioseph</hi> was the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for Grace and Goodness of all his Brethren, he was the most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man for Grace and Holiness, therefore he must be the Mark.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. BUrial, and Christian Burial, and solemn Burial, are all Evidences and Testimonies of Gods Presence. God forbid we should conclude or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue an absence of God from the want of solemn Burial, or Christian Burial, or any Burial. But neither must we deny it to be an evidence of his Favour and Presence, where he is pleased to afford these. So God makes that the seal of all his Blessings to <hi>Abram,</hi> that he should be buried in a good old age. God established <hi>Iacob</hi> with that Promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. that his Son should have care of his Funerals: And here <hi>Ioseph</hi> doth command his Servants the Physitians to embalme him when he was dead. To the same purpose also of Christ it was promised, that he should have a glorious Burial. <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. and therefore Christ interprets well that profuse and prodigal piety of the Woman that poured out the Ointment upon him, that she did it to bury him. And so shall <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> be ever famous for his care in celebrating Christs Funerals. If we were to send a Son or a Friend to take possession of any place in Court or forraign parts, we would send him out in the best equipage: Let us not grudge therefore to set down our Friends in the Anti-chamber of Heaven the Grave, in as good a manner as without vain-gloriousness and wastfulness we may.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. Solemn and appointed mournings are good expressions of our dearness to the departed Soul of our Friend, and of his Worth and our value of him, and it hath its praise in Nature, in Manners, and in publick Customes. Let thy Friend therefore be Interr'd after the Manner of the Country, and the Laws of the Place, and the Dignity of the Person. For so <hi>Iacob</hi> here was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with great solemnity and publick mourning; and Devout men carried <hi>Stephen</hi> to his Burial, making great lamentation over him. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that man is esteemed to die miserably, for whom no Friend, no Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive sheds a tear, or payes a solemn sigh. I desire to die a dry Death, but am not very desirous to have a dry Funeral: Some Flowers sprinkled on my Grave would doe well, and a soft showre to turn those Flowers into a springing memory, or a fair rehearsal, that I may not goe out of my doors as servants carry out the entrailes of Beasts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 12. Iacob</hi> on his Death-bed bound his Sons by oath to interre him in a prescript solemnity. And indeed those solemn Rites which we strew on the Funerals of our deceased Friend are no effect of curtesie but debt: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those dispositions are little below barbarous, which snarle at a moderate sorrow and decent interrment of the Dead. He then that in a wayward Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall disallow of either, may well deserve the honour of <hi>Iehoiakims</hi> Funeral, the burial of an Asse. Had not our Saviour his clean Linnen, his sweet Ointment, his new Sepulchre?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. This was a religious Providence the Patriarchs had in purchasing a possession place for their burial; and Posterity kept it up a long time, even to superstition, thinking their bones never at rest till they were laid in the Sepulchre of their Fathers. Which honourable way of Interrment in these tympanous and swelling times of ours, were a good means to preserve our Names from rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, if our Law-Suits, and Pride, and Riot have left so much of a devoured Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance as will serve the Dimensions of a dead Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. The guilty Conscience can never think its self safe: So many years experience of <hi>Iosephs</hi> Love could not secure his Brethren of remission: Those that know they have deserved ill, are wont to mis-interpret favours, and think they cannot be beloved. All that while his Goodness seem'd but conceal'd and sleeping Malice; which they fear'd in their Fathers last sleep would awake and bewray its self in revenge. Still therefore they plead the Name of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though dead, not daring to use their own. Good meanings cannot be more wrong'd than with suspition: It greives <hi>Ioseph</hi> to see their fear, and to find they had not forgotten their own sin, and to hear them so passionately crave that which they had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 17. Forgive the trespass of the Servants of thy Fathers God.</hi> What a conjuration of pardon was this? What Wound could be either so deep or so festered as this Plaister could not cure. They say not, the Sons of thy Father; for they knew <hi>Iacob</hi> was dead, and they had degenerated, but, <hi>the Servants of thy Fathers God.</hi> How much stronger are the bonds of Religion than of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! If <hi>Ioseph</hi> had been rancorous this Deprecation had charm'd him, but now it resolves him into tears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. They are not so ready to acknowledge their old offence, as he to protest his Love; and if he chide them for any thing it is for that they thought they needed to entreat; since they might know it could not stand with the fellow-servant of their Fathers God to harbour maliciousness, to purpose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. <hi>Am not I under God?</hi> And fully to secure them he turns their eyes from themselves to the Decree of God, from the Action to the Event; as one that would have them think there was no cause to repent of that which proved so successful. And from hence we learn also, that even late confession finds for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness. <hi>Ioseph</hi> had long ago seen their sorrow, never but now heard he their humble acknowledgement; Mercy staies not for outward solemnities. How much
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36907:42"/>
more shall that Infinite Goodness pardon our sins, when he finds the truth of our repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. Be sin what it will be in the nature of it, yet my sin shall conduce and co-operate for my good. So <hi>Ioseph</hi> said here to his Brethren, <hi>You thought evil against me, but God meant it unto Good;</hi> which was not only good to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> who was no partaker in the evil, but good even to them who meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but evil. And therefore as <hi>Origen</hi> said, <hi>etsi novum,</hi> though it be strangely said, yet I say it, that Gods anger is good: so said St. <hi>Augustine, audeo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> though it be boldly said, yet I must say it, many sinners would never have been saved if they had not committed some greater sin at last than before; for the punishment of that sin hath brought them to a remorse of all their other sins formerly neglected.</p>

So assuredly true are all other of Gods Promises, and therefore think of what you will, your Faith and Comfort shall not fail you. That sweet Promise, <hi>That at what time soever a sinner repents of his sin, God in mercy will forgive him;</hi> it shall never fail. God may as soon cease to be God, as cease to be true in any thing that he hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. So both for this Life and that to come we have Gods Word; and no more than he fail'd <hi>Abraham</hi> in multiplying of his Seed, will he fail us in any Promise. Only we must tarry Gods time, and hasty minds must learn humble patience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:36907:44"/>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. The rising of Houses and Families is from the Lord, who blesseth where he pleaseth with increase of Children, and maketh a name spread; as likewise drieth up and cutteth off, as he pleaseth, others. Which ought to make us cease from envy where we see increase, and stay rash judgement where we see decrease; for it is the Lords work. But then whereas it may be collected from the former verse, that this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful increase was not till after <hi>Iosephs</hi> death, it will afford us this observation, that what was here figured in <hi>Ioseph</hi> was fulfilled in Christ. For before Christ died few believed in him, but after his Death and Resurrection the true <hi>Israelites</hi> increased and multiplied exceedingly throughout the whole World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. Gods Favour bestowed in Mercy where he liketh is still an eye-sore to evil men, matter enough for them to grate their teeth at, and to cause them to enter into Plots and Conspiracies against them. The Eye of Envy looks ever upwards, who is above, who riseth, who prospereth, and is as much greived at the good of another as at the harm of its self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. Although this Counsel favoured wholly of bloud, yet it is covered with the vizard and die of Wisdome. So still is the Devil like himself, and ever in his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; the Proud man is Neat, the Covetous man Provident, the Drunkard a good Fellow, and here the bloody minded <hi>Egyptians</hi> are politick and wise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. As God afflicted them with another mind then the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (God to exercise them, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to suppress them) so causes he the event to differ. Who would not have thought with these <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that so extream misery should not have made the <hi>Israelites</hi> unfit both for generation and resistance. Moderate exercise strengthens, extreame destroyes Nature: That God which many times works by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary means, caused them to grow with depression, with persecution to multiply; how can Gods Church but fare well, since the very malice of their Enemies benefits them? Oh the soveraign Goodness of our God, that turns all our Poysons into Cordials: Gods Vine bears the better for the pruning hook.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. The stronger the <hi>Isarelites</hi> grew, the more impotent grew the malice of their Persecutors: And since their own labour strengthens them, now tyranny will try what can be done by the violence of others; since the present strength cannot be subdued, the hopes of succession must be prevented. Women must be suborn'd to be Murtherers, and those whose Office is to help the birth must destroy it. 'Tis true, there was lesse suspition of cruelty in that Sex, but yet more opportunity of doing mischiefs. The Male-Children must be born and die at once; What can be more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent than a Child, that hath not lived so much as to cry, or to see light? It is fault enough to be the Son of an <hi>Israelite:</hi> the Daughters may live for bondage, for lust, a condition so much, at the least, worse than death, as their Sex was weaker. O mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous cruelty, that a man should kill a man for his Sexes sake: Whosoever hath loosed the raines unto cruelty is easily carried into incredible extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. The fear of God teacheth the Midwives to disobey an unjust Command; they well knew how no excuse it is for evil, I was bidden: God said to their hearts, <hi>Thou shalt not kill;</hi> this Voice was louder than <hi>Pharaohs!</hi> I commend their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in disobeying; I dare not commend their excuse; there was as much weakness in their Answer, as strength in their Practice; as they feared God in not killing, so they feared <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in dissembling: Oft-times those that make conscience of greater sins are overtaken with lesse. It is well and rare if we can come forth of a dangerous Action without any Foil; and if we have escaped the storme that some after-drops wet us not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. It is dangerous to conclude an Action to be good, either because he that did it had a good purpose in doing it, or because some good effects proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it. The Midwives Lye here in the behalf of the <hi>Israelites</hi> Children, was a Lye and a Sin, however God out of his own Goodness found something in their piety to reward. I should not venture to say as he said, nor yet venture to say that he said well, when <hi>Moses</hi> said, <hi>Forgive this sin, or blot me out of thy Book;</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:36907:44"/>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:36907:45"/>
nor when St. <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>I could wish that my self were separated from Christ for my Brethren.</hi> I would not, I could not without sin, be content that my name should be blotted out of the Book of Life, or that I should be separated from Christ, though all the World besides were to be blotted out and separated if I stayed in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. Who would not have expected that the Midwives should be murthered for not murthering? <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could not be so simple to think these Women trusty, yet his indignation had no power to reach to their punishment. God prospered the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives, who can harm them? Even the not doing of evil is rewarded with good. And why did they prosper? Because they feared God; not for their dissimulation, but their pitty. So did God regard their mercy, that he regarded not their infirmity. How fondly do men lay the thank upon the sin, which is due to the vertue: True Wisdome reaches to distinguish Gods Actions, and to ascribe them to the right Causes; pardon belongs to the lye of the Midwives, and remuneration to their goodness, prosperity to their fear of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. That which the Midwives will not, the Multitude shall do; it were strange if wicked Rulers should not find some or other Instruments of violence: All the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple must drown what the Women saved. Cruelty did but smoak before, now it flamed out, secret practising hath made it shameless, that now it dare proclaim tyranny. It is a miserable State where every man is made an Executioner; there can be no greater Argument of an ill Cause than a bloudy Persecution, whereas Truth upholds her self by Mildness, and is promoted by Patience: This is their Act, what was their Issue? The People must drown their Males, themselves are drown'd; they died by the same means by which they caused the poor Israelitish Infants to die. God would have us read our sins in our judgements, that we might both repent of our sins and give Glory to his Justice.</p>

                  <hi>Verse.</hi> 2. NO doubt when <hi>Iochebed</hi> the Mother of <hi>Moses</hi> saw a Man-child born of her, and him beautiful and comely, she fell into extream passion to think that the Executioners hand should succeed the Midwives. All the time of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception she could not but fear a Son, now she sees him, and thinks of his Birth and Death at once, her second pangs and throws are more greivous than her first. The pains of travel in others are somewhat mitigated with hope, and countervail'd with joy that a Man-child is born; in her they are doubled with fear; the remedy of others is her complaint: Still she looks when some fierce <hi>Egyptian</hi> would come in and snatch her new born Infant out of her bosome, whose comeliness had now also added to her affliction: And therefore when she can no longer hide him in her Womb, she hides him in her House, afraid lest every of his cryings should guide the Executioners to his Cradle. And if thus careful are earthly Parents of their Children, how transcendent think you is the care that God (our heavenly Father) takes of all those that are his?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. What did the Father all the while, that the Scripture still mentioneth the Mother, saying, she did thus and thus? Truly, likely it was he was amazed, and stood as a man at his wits end, not seeing what to doe; The Woman, enabled by God, was the better Man at this time. Thus sometimes in the weaker vessel Gods strength is more seen, and he doth enable them now and then for that purpose. The knowledge of this should yield them a fit regard, and Men may not ever disdain to follow them, by whom they see God sometimes doth work. Remember <hi>Pilates</hi> Wives advice; <hi>Have not thou to do with that just Man.</hi>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. No tyranny can forbid her to love him whom she is forbiddento keep, her Daughters Eyes must supply the place of her Armes. And if the weak affection of a Mother were thus effectually careful, what shall we think of him, whose Love, whose Compassion is (as himself) infinite? His Eye, his Hand, cannot but be with us, even when we forsake our selves: <hi>Moses</hi> had never a stronger protection about him, no not when all his <hi>Israelites</hi> were pitch'd about his Tent in the Wilderness, than now, when he lay sprawling upon the waves: No water, no <hi>Egyptian</hi> can hurt him. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friend nor Mother dare own him, and now God challenges his custody. When we seem most neglected and forlorne in our selves, then is God most present, most vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. From hence we may learn first, that there is no Rock more sure, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge more comfortable (when mans power fails) than Gods gracious Providence. Secondly, how able God is to dispose of mens courses, otherwise than at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they intended. For this Lady purposed only to walk and wash her, but God had a work of Mercy to doe by her. Thirdly, where are they that talk of Fortune? What more casual in mans eye than this Ladies walking that way; yet you see it was no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; but disposed wholly by the Providence of God, for the life of the Child, the joy of his Parents, and the deliverance of the <hi>Israelites.</hi> Lastly, we see plainly how mans counsel cannot hinder that which God hath determined shall come to passe. <hi>Moses</hi> must live and become a Deliverer unto <hi>Israel,</hi> do <hi>Pharaoh</hi> what he can: And though many poor Infants were cast away to prevent his fear, yet that very Infant, which must effect what he so much fear'd, is preserved alive in despight of him; yea nourished up by his own Daughter in his own bosome. The like to this we have in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the parallel Example of <hi>Herod</hi> and those Infants; where our Saviour is the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-type of <hi>Moses,</hi> and was preserved in the common slaughter of Infants to deliver his People from an eternal slavery, as <hi>Moses</hi> was preserved to deliver the Israelites from a temporal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 9. Moses</hi> his Sister finding the Princess compassionate, offers to procure a Nurse, and fetches the Mother; and who can be so fit a Nurse as a Mother. She now with glad hands receives her Child both with authority and reward She would have given all her estate for the life of her Son; and now she hath a reward to nurse him. The exchange of the name of a Mother for the name of a Nurse hath gained her both her Son and his education, and with both a recompence. Religion doth not call us to a weak simplicity, but allows us as much of the Serpent as the Dove; lawful Policies have from God both liberty in the use, and blessing in the success.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 11. Moses</hi> went forth and look'd on the burthens of <hi>Israel.</hi> What needed <hi>Moses</hi> to have afflicted himself with the afflictions of others? Himself was at ease and pleasure in the Court of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> A good heart cannot endure to be happy alone, and must needs, unbidden, share with others in miseries. He is no true <hi>Moses</hi> that is not moved with the calamities of Gods Church. To see an <hi>Egyptian</hi> smite an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> it smote him, and moved him to smite. He hath no Israelitish bloud in him, that can endure to see an <hi>Israelite</hi> stricken either with hand or tongue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. Here Magistrates may learn constancy and continuance in their care for their People. For it is not enough one day to come and see how all goes, as when they first enter upon their Office; but even the second day they should do the same, and so day by day, as occasion serveth, during the time of their charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. The man that complains here was he that offered the injury; none so ready to except and exclaim as the Wrong-doer, the Patient replies not: And now the first Adversary is forgot, and he that would have made them Friends is the only Enemy; as it often happens, to the parter of a Fray, the Reconciler hath the most blows. A clear Glasse for all eyes to see the reward many times given to peaceable men, when they endeavour to unite their jarring Brethren. But this must be no discouragement to <hi>Moses;</hi> for God will reward him, although his Brother thought that friendly office not worth thanks. Nay this very upbraiding <hi>Israelite</hi> shall save <hi>Moses</hi> his life. For if this mans tongue had not cast him in the teeth with bloud, he had been surprized by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:36907:46"/>
                  <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ere he could have known the fact was known: Now he grows jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, flies and escapes; no Friend is so commodious in some cases as an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. God hath alwayes one place of refuge or other for his Servants to fly unto. If <hi>Iudea</hi> be dangerous for the Child <hi>Iesus,</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> he shall find safety; and again, if <hi>Egypt</hi> threaten death to <hi>Moses, Midian</hi> shall preserve him, and improve him likewise. For God by forty years exile fitted <hi>Moses</hi> for further light and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Much he had learnt in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but more in <hi>Midian.</hi> There is no doubt but he had good School-masters in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, but his own affliction was his best. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> had never been so illuminate a Doctor, nor so excellent a Ruler afterwards, if he had not been first humbled here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 17. Moses</hi> when he may not in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he will be doing Justice in <hi>Midian.</hi> In <hi>Egypt</hi> he delivers the oppressed <hi>Israelite,</hi> in <hi>Midian</hi> the wrong'd Daughters of <hi>Iethro.</hi> A good Man will be doing good wheresoever he is; his Trade is a compound of Charity and Justice. But who would have thought in this present condition as <hi>Moses</hi> was, so cast down with his own complaints, that he would have had any feeling of others; yet how hot is he upon Justice? No adversity can make a good Man neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect good Duties; he sees in the oppression of the Shepherds the image of that other he left behind him in <hi>Egypt:</hi> The Maids (Daughters of so great a Peer) draw water for their Flocks, the inhumane Shepherds drive them away; rudeness hath not respect either to Sex or condition. If we lived not under Laws this were our case; Might would be the measure of Justice; we should not so much as injoy our own water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. It seems by this Text that <hi>Moses</hi> his affection was not so tyed to <hi>Midian</hi> that he could forget <hi>Egypt.</hi> He was a Stranger in <hi>Midian:</hi> What was he else in <hi>Egypt?</hi> Surely either <hi>Egypt</hi> was not his Home, or a miserable one; and yet in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to it he cals his Son <hi>Gershom,</hi> a Stranger there. Much better were it to be a Stranger there than a Dweller in <hi>Egypt.</hi> How hardly can we forget the place of our abode or education, although never so homely. And if he thought of his <hi>Egyptian</hi> Home, where was nothing but bondage and tyranny, how should we think of that Home of ours above, where is nothing but rest and blessedness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 23. This is a Comfort to the Godly, as likewise it should be a Warning to all Oppressors of Gods Children; they shall die and be packing, and shall not continue to deal cruelly with Gods Inheritance. The rod of the ungodly lighteth upon the Faithful, but the Lord hath said, it shall not rest and dwell upon them. But however it was but just with God to let them sigh by reason of their bondage. Such sobs of sorrow were but due to them that rejected and would not see what God offered them of ease. A singular Warning to beware the rejection of Gods Mercy when it is offered; for such a refusal hath ever a sure punishment attending upon it. Forty years agoe God offered them deliverance by <hi>Moses,</hi> which when they refused they were plagued with forty years more of slavery. But yet at length, when they sighed, God heard that very sorrowful breathing. Sweet Father, so it is ever with thee just to correct, but gracious to give over; not ever offended, but in due time intreated, pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, loving, and of endless mercy.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. THat great men may not be ashamed of honest Vocations, the greatest that ever were have been content to take up with mean Trades. The same <hi>Moses</hi> that in the former Chapter was a Courtier, is in this verse a Shepherd. The contempt of honest Callings in those which are well born, argues Pride without Wit. How constantly did <hi>Moses</hi> stick to his Hook, and yet a man of great Spirit, of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Learning, of curious Education, and if God had not called him off, he had so end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his dayes. In the mean time, how had he learn'd to subdue all ambitious desires, and to rest content with his obscurity! so he might have the freedome of his thoughts, and full opportunity of holy Meditations, he willingly leaves the World to others, and envies not his proudest Acquaintance of the Court of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> He that hath true worth in himself, and familiarity with God, finds more pleasure in the Desarts of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> than others can do in the Palaces of Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. This manner of appearing may occasion us to remember how God useth to apply himself to the purpose and intent of his appearing. <hi>Isai.</hi> 6. 1. He is said to appear like a Judge, because as then the judgement of <hi>Ifrael</hi> drew near. At the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of Christ it pleased the Holy Ghost to appear like a Dove, because that form might shew the innocency and mild nature of our Saviour: And now here like a Bush burning, but not consumed, that it might declare the present state of his People in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and the condition of his Church unto the Worlds end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. In this appearance God meant to call <hi>Moses</hi> to come, yet when he is come inhibits him <hi>(Come not hither.)</hi> We must come to God, but we must not come too near him. When we mediate of the great Mysteries of his Word, we come to him; we come too near him, when we search into his Counsels. The Sun and the Fire say of themselves, come not too near; how much more the Light which none can attain unto. We have all our limits set us, and very good reason for it: For the Waves of the Sea had not more need of bounds than mans presumption. <hi>Moses</hi> must not come close to the Bush at all; and where he may stand he may not stand with his shooes on. This Command was significant. What are the shooes but worldly and carnal affections? If these be not cast off when we come to the holy Place, we make our selves unholy: How much lesse should we dare to come with resolutions of sin: This is not only to come with shooes on, but with shooes bemired with wicked filthiness; the touch whereof prophanes the Pavement of God, and makes our presence odious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. God could not describe himself by a more sweet Name than this; <hi>I am the God of thy Father, and of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. yet <hi>Moses</hi> hides his face for fear: If he had said, I am the Glorious God that made Heaven and Earth, that dwels in Light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible, whom Angels cannot behold; here had been just cause of terror. But why was <hi>Moses</hi> so frighted with a familiar compellation. God is no lesse awful to his own in his very Mercies; <hi>Great is thy Mercies that thou maist be fear'd.</hi> For to them no lesse Majesty shines in the Favours of God than in his Judgements and Justice. The wicked heart never fears God but thundring or raining fire from Heaven, but the good can dread him in his very sun-shine; his loving Deliverances and Blessings affect them with awfulness. <hi>Moses</hi> was the true Son of <hi>Iacob,</hi> who when he saw nothing but vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Love and Mercy, could say, <hi>How dreadful is this place?</hi>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. If we would have our greif seen and helped, we must endeavour to become Gods People. For then sighing and groaning in our several afflictions, as these did, we may be sure in due time to find our comfort as they found. We may hence also learn, that affliction doth not shew that the party is disliked of God, (as the Devil often suggests to men and women in trouble) for God calleth these <hi>Israelites</hi> his People, which yet were plunged in the depth of misery and affliction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. This should teach every one of us humility, and to say with <hi>Moses, Who am I, Lord,</hi> that thou should'st thus and thus think of me chuse me, and take me to that

place that I have no strength to manage, and which thousands of my Brethren are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for than I am. This also may put us in mind of the weighty calling of Ministers. For is it such a matter to strive with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for Bodies and temporal servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and is it nothing to fight with the Devil for Souls and freedome from eternal slavery.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. See a sweet comfort in all our fears, even his Name, <hi>I AM.</hi> Noting, that as he hath been to penitent sinners, so ever he will be without any change. If I call upon him, and depend upon him, <hi>I AM</hi> is his Name, and I may not doubt of him, he is no Changeling, but the same for ever.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. When any new thing is to be published that concerneth any change in Church or Common-wealth, we must acquaint the Magistrates, Rulers and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours with it, to approve our Commission and matter unto them, with all Modesty, Humility, Fear and Care of Order and Unity, and then with their consents and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance unto the People and Multitude. This is a right course, and this shall have a Blessing from the Author of it, as here it had, <hi>Then shall they obey thy voice,</hi> verse 18.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. See again, and still most carefully note it, how God regardeth Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For now <hi>Pharaoh</hi> must be used as was fit for his place (he being the King of that Land in which they were) wicked <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> I say, must not be disorderly dealt with by such as live under his Government, although Strangers and not his natural Subjects, how much then by natural Subjects? But he must be gone unto with all duty, and acquainted with their desire with all reverence, that neither themselves may be judged factious, neither others by their examples moved to any disorder. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must acquaint him with the Author of their desires, not their own heads lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting after liberty or novelty, but the Lord God.</p>

He can make them love, hate they never so much. Yea, he can make them so love, that fruits from thence shall flow to his People of their love. Be they Jewels of Silver or Rayment, they shall grant it, and send it, give it, or lend it, with so willing a mind as the party taking needeth to wish.</p>

THe heart of man is like the Rod of <hi>Moses,</hi> as long as he held it in his hand it remained a Rod, but when he threw it to the ground it turn'd instantly into a Serpent, nay a Dragon the Prince of Serpents (as <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Iew</hi> saith:) so the heart of man, as long as there is fast hold of it; as long as Man is the Possessor, God the Guardian, it continues still an heart, but if our boistrous unruly sins once throw it to the earth, it changeth instantly to be a Serpent. From whence all carnal and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded men may learn, whose Consciences at the reading hereof tell them, that their hearts are turn'd into Serpents and Vipers by their sins, and are now crawling on the earth in their lustful designes, to stretch forth a hand of sorrow, a hand of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to take them up again, in what shape soever they appear. For he that was exalted on the Crosse, as the Serpent in the Wildernesse, shall turn those Serpents into Hearts again, their Gall and Poison into Innocence, their Sting of Death into Issues of Immortal Life.</p>

But if thou hast taken this Serpent into thy hand, rest not till like <hi>Moses</hi> Serpent it be turned into a Rod again to scourge thy Soul, till a true sense of thy sins, and of Gods Wrath due unto thee for the same, bring thee to a

serious repentance and contrition, to a spiritual loathing and abhorrency of those sins; that so thou maist never cast thine eye back upon them, but with a new and a particular detestation, thou maist never enter into meditation of those sinful passages of thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life, but with shame and horror of soul, and that every solemn review of those dayes of darkness and unregeneration may make the wounds of our remorse to bleed afresh.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. When <hi>Moses</hi> pluck'd his hand out of his bosome it was leprous, and again when he pluck'd it out it was white; to shew that the actions of our hands receive their denomination from the bosome, the heart; according to that saying of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Tantum habent virtutis aut vitii actiones quantum habent voluntatis.</hi>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. He that is singled out to any service of his God, for the advantage of his <hi>Israel,</hi> must not give back or waver, but go boldly on. If a willing obedience se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond his Command, God promiseth to assist, <hi>I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say,</hi> was Gods Promise here to <hi>Moses;</hi> and it was his Sons to the Apostles, <hi>Mat. 10. 19. Take no thought how or what ye shall speak, for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak.</hi> As if he had said, be not anxious about matter or manner of your Apology for your selves; ye shall be supplied from on High, both with Invention and Elocution; you shall have your help from Heaven: <hi>For it is not you that speak,</hi> saith our Saviour in the next verse, <hi>but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you;</hi> who borroweth your mouth for the present to speak by. It is he that forms your speeches for you, dictates them to you, filleth you with matter, and furnisheth you with words. Fear not therefore your rudeness to reply; there is no mouth into which God cannot put words: And how oft doth he chuse the Weak and Unlearned to confound the Wise and Mighty, as he did <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi> Asse to confute his Master.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. Husbands see from hence the heart of a good man to have his Wife and Children with him: Wives and Children see their duty to be followers willingly of their Husbands or Fathers calling even into any Country. And when I look at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> his Rod, methinks I see little <hi>David</hi> marching chearfully with his Staffe and Scrip against huge <hi>Goliah.</hi> Good Lord, what Weapons were those against him then in mans eyes? Or this Staffe now in <hi>Moses</hi> hand against <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> But God is the same both here and then and for ever, strong in weakness, and able to match a Kings Scepter with a Stick, or a Staffe, or a Stone, or a word in the hand or mouth of one sent and appointed by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. Gods Church is to him as a Man-child to the Father, yea as the First-born, which commonly is loved most tenderly, and in greatest honour. Now think with your selves how you could endure to stand and look upon an abuse offered to your First-born, and then think of Gods Love to his Church, whose affection as much excelleth yours as God excelleth man. Now as tender Fathers for the good of their Children suffer them to lie in prison, and to be school'd many wayes by want and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and yet in the midst of all have an eye to them, a love to them, and a settled purpose to help them, when a love may be known a love, and a good a good. So our God knows his times and turns, and our wants perfectly, fitting the one to the other most mercifully, that both our corruption and his goodness may best appear to the greatest benefit unto us. He may see us humbled, and school'd, and tamed, but undone and cast away for ever, he cannot endure it, he will not suffer it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 24. I do not so much marvel, that <hi>Iethro</hi> gave <hi>Moses</hi> his Daughter, (for he saw him valiant, wise, learned, nobly bred) as that <hi>Moses</hi> would take her; a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger both in bloud and Religion. The choice had like to have cost him dear in this verse: His Wife stood in his way for Circumcision, God stands in his way for Revenge. Though he was now upon Gods Message, yet might he not be forborn in this neglect. No circumstance, either of the dearness of the Sollicitor, or of our own engagement, can bear out a sin with God. Those which are unequally yoaked may not ever look to draw one way: True Love to the Person cannot long agree with dislike of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. He had need to be more than a Man that hath a <hi>Zipporah</hi> lying in his bosome,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:36907:48"/>
and can have true zeal in his heart. Learn further from hence all unquiet Women, what your ignorance and your obstinacy bringeth your Husbands unto, though they be, as <hi>Moses,</hi> holy and vertuous; they cannot serve God aright for you, they cannot do what God requireth, but you break their hearts, you cool their zeal, you turn them out of the way, and in the end you bring them to a fearful danger of Gods destroying them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 26. That which <hi>Zipporah</hi> should have esteemed as a signal Mercy to her Child, she interprets as a Judgement, and that very Covenant of God (of which Circumcision was the seal) which she should have received with the greatest return of thanks, was entertained with disobedience, both toward her Husband and her God. Thus ignorant and unthankful people mis-interpret and repine at the Dispensations of Gods Providence, and that which God designes for a Mercy and a Blessing to them, they take it as a Judgement and a Curse. <hi>It is good for me that I was afflicted,</hi> faith <hi>David;</hi> Yet how many are there in the World, that think otherwise, and would chuse rather to be out of the Covenant than be circumcised, to perish hereafter, than be afflicted here.</p>

                  <hi>Verse 1. PHaraoh</hi> raged before, much more now, that he received a Message of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; the Monitions of God make ill men worse; the Waves do not beat nor roar any where so much as at the Bank, which restraines them; Corruption when 'tis checked grows mad with rage; as the vapour in a Cloud would not make that fearful report if it met not with opposition. A good heart yeilds at the stillest Voice of God, but the most gracious Motions of God harden the wicked: Many would not be so desperately setled in their sins if the World had not controul'd them. How mild a Message was this to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and yet how galling? God commands him that which he feared. He took pleasure in the present servitude of <hi>Israel,</hi> God cals for a release: If the Suit had been for mitigation of labour, for preservation of their Children, it might have carried some hope, and have found some favour: But now God requires that which he knows will as much discontent <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty could discontent the <hi>Israelites.</hi> How contrary are Gods Precepts to mans mind? And indeed as they love to crosse him in their practise, so he loves to crosse them in his Commands before, and their Punishments after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 4. Moses</hi> talks of Sacrifice, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> talks of Work. Any thing seems due Work to a carnal mind saving Gods Service; nothing superfluous but religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Christ tels us, there is but one thing necessary, Nature tels us, there is nothing but that needless: <hi>Moses</hi> speaks of Devotion, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of Idleness. It hath been an old use, as to cast fair colours upon our own vitious actions, so to cast evil aspersions upon the good actions of others. The same Devil that spoke in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> speaks still in our Scoffers, and cals Religion Hypocrisie, conscionable Care Singularity. Every Vice hath a title, and every Vertue a disgrace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. Wicked men have no eyes often to see the true causes of a thing, but most apt and ready to devise a false. Let a man or woman be grieved extraordinarily with the burthen of their sins, and with groans and sighs travail under the bitterness of it: What say the Wicked? Oh it is Melancholy, and the body must be purged. <hi>Festus</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth <hi>Paul</hi> mad, when he speaketh the words of Truth and Soberness, <hi>Act. 26. 24. And that much learning made him mad,</hi> when Learning is Wisdome, and maketh wise. Yea, <hi>Heli</hi> himself mistaketh <hi>Anna,</hi> a vertuous Woman, and deemeth her to be drunk, when ravished in her holy feeling she was crying to God in fervent Prayer, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. The nearer that God draweth to his Church and Children to do them good, the more the Devil rageth in and by his Members against them. Remember that example in <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 26. How the foul Spirit, being commanded to depart, rent and tare the party more and worse than ever before. We cannot leave any sin wherein we have continued, but by and by we shall be discouraged, sometimes with threats, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with shew of perils and losses that may ensue. But stand, and shrink not, and say in your heart, now, now, is my God at hand, for now I see and feel the Enemy mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to oppress me if he could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. Note here how the Law works without the Gospel, even roughly and sharply, and rigorously. For do this, do this, and finish, finish the work, is still the voice, whereby sin and the Devil rageth as here <hi>Pharaoh</hi> doth. For sin, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 8, 9, then crieth the true Israelite. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death,</hi> verse 24. Blessed therefore be the Lord for his sweet Gospel, which helpeth all this rigour, and giveth us comfort and deliverance in his Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. While possible tasks were imposed there was some comfort; their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence might save their backs from stripes: but to require tasks not feazible is tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and doth only pick a quarrel to punish; they could neither make straw nor find, yet they must have it. Do what may be, is tolerable, but do what cannot be, is cruel. Those that are above others in place must measure their commands not by their own wils, but by the strength of their inferiors. The task is not done, the Task-masters are beaten, the punishment lies where the charge is, they must exact it of the people, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of them. It is the misery of those that are trusted with Authority, that their inferiors faults are beaten upon their backs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. See the condition and lot of faithful Ministers in this wretched world. First the King, and now their Brethren accuse them for doing their duty. While all is well, good is the Minister; but when the crosse cometh, he and his doctrine away with that, and away with him; as <hi>Ier.</hi> 44. 16, &amp;c. now mark their reason: <hi>For then had we plenty, &amp;c.</hi> this is the stay of the multitude, and this is the line they measure all things by, their prosperity in worldly matters, and immunity from trouble and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any wayes.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. MIserable man remembreth and heareth his Friends when they are in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, but if adversity come, neither hearing nor seeing them, but a proud, scornful and bitter forgetting. The Lord is not so; but when we are at the worst, then he remembreth us, then he heareth our groans, and sighs, and pittying helpeth, to our unspeakable comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. The end of all deliverance, and of all Benefits received from God, is, that we should be his People, and that he might rule in us, and over us. Wherefore see how careful we should be alwayes to answer this our calling, and never to be found unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of such favours. For if this plainer manifestation of his Goodness to the <hi>Iews,</hi> were a just cause to stir them up to thankfulness, how much more should his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of himself to us in his own Son, move us to an eternal care to please him? And then more particularly, that he should accept me for one of his people. O what can I say for such a Love, but beseech him ever to make me thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. As long as our hearts hold this perswasion of God, that he is the Lord, so long we must rest assured, that he can perform his Promise, in mercy made to us, be the difficulties never so many. What then is thy Case? Are thy sins numerous and great? Remember he is the Lord, and play not <hi>Cains</hi> part, to say, they cannot be forgiven: Are thine Enemies bitterly bent against thee, he is the Lord, and therefore can stop and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36907:49"/>
stay them at his pleasure. Are their infirmities many, he can heal them, he is the Lord. Are thy Children untoward and unkind, he can change them, he is the Lord. Lastly, whatever greives thee remember this, that God is the Lord, and shall ever be the Lord, and shall ever be thy Lord to care for thy woes and relieve them: Only believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. It is often a penalty laid upon the contemners of Gods Grace, that clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving altogether to the external favours of this life, they tast not comfort in any affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; whereas the Godly the more they are pressed down by God, the more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently they sigh unto God, and look to his Promises with Patience and Hope. This also may teach Gods Ministers not to be cast down and discouraged if their words be not hearkened unto and regarded, since so worthy a man as <hi>Moses</hi> found this measure. The World will be the World, crooked and perverse, froward and unkind, though we break our hearts for their good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. Before <hi>Moses</hi> was bid to go to the People, and now to <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> so is there never any time for men of place and publick function to be idle. Now they must defend the oppressed and wrong'd, now they must comfort, now they must chide. See here likewise the bottomless Mercies of the Lord, who though he might justly have cast off this People, that would not hearken to his Words and Messages, yet he doth not, but still continueth to have mercy on them, according to that of <hi>Psalm</hi> 103. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. It is a wonder that <hi>Amram</hi> the Father of <hi>Moses</hi> would think of the Marriage-bed in so troublesome a time, when he knew he should beget Children either to slavery or slaughter: Yet even now in the heat of this bondage he marries <hi>Iochebed:</hi> The drowning of his Sons was not so great an evil as his own burning, the thraldome of his Daughters not so great an evil as the subjection unto sinful desires. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uses Gods remedy for his sin, and refers the sequel of his danger to God. How necessary is this imitation for those that have not the power of containing. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we would have thought it better to live childless; but <hi>Amram</hi> and <hi>Iochebed</hi> durst not incurre the danger of a sin to avoid the danger of a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif.</p>

It is our frailty, that those Services which we are forward to aloof off, we shrink at neer at hand.

Neither hath God determined that power of assisting others in the character of the Priesthood only, but he hath also made the Prince and the secular Magistrate a God, that is able to do the Offices and the Works of God, not only to the people, but to the Priest himself to sustain him, yea, and to countenance, and favour, and protect him too in the execution and exercise of his Priestly Office. As we see in the first plantation of

                  <hi>Verse 10. Pharaoh</hi> was now from a staffe of protection and sustentation to Gods People, turn'd to a Serpent that stung them to death; God shews himself in this real Emblem doing that suddenly before him, which Sathan had wrought in him by leisure. And now when he crawles and hisses threatning peril to <hi>Israel,</hi> he shews him how in an instant he can turn him into a senseless stick, and make him, if not useful, yet fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. The same God which wrought this, gave Sathan leave to imitate it in the next verse. The first Plague that God meant to inflict upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was delusion. God can be content the Devil should win himself credit, where he means to judge, and holds the honour of a Miracle well lost, to harden an Enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. Here we may see the end of Falsehood and Error at the last, Truth shall devour it in Gods good time, for great is truth and prevaileth. Truth may be oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for a time, God so pleasing, either to punish or try his People, but finally suppress'd it shall not be; God being stronger than all his Enemies, <hi>Moses</hi> than all Enchanters, shall disperse all dusky Clouds, bringing his glorious Truth out to bear sway again at his good pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. This Plague God brought upon them, for the Children which were drown'd, and the River thus turned into bloud complained to God for that slaughter. We may further note an encrease of terror in this Miracle above the former of the Serpents, to signifie, that where milder means will not serve, God both can and will add sharper and heavier. He encreaseth his crosses from Goods to Body, from Body to Mind, from our Selves to our Children, and still maketh us abound with more want in greater and sharper measure, that we may repent and return, if not, in the end he can destroy us with misery that never shall have an end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. First, God begins his Judgements with Waters. As the River <hi>Nilus</hi> was to <hi>Egypt,</hi> instead of Heaven, to moisten and fatten the Earth, so their confidence was more in it than in Heaven. Men are sure to be punish'd most and soonest in that which they make a corrival with God. This change also of the Waters into bloud was an image of their future destruction. They were afterward overwhelmed in the Red Sea, and now before-hand they see the River red with bloud.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. VVHat an Army is here against such a Prince. God could have made use of Men or Angels. But here he will confound the pride of such a conceited King by an Host of Frogs, rather than by either of the other. The Lord by contemptible and base things will cast down our high looks if we swell against him: and of this he would have all high minds at this day to make use unto humility before they find it too late.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. Gods Adversaries seek often to impugne the Truth by the self same means whereby he doth teach it. As if Scripture be alledged, Sathan will do the like, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. If the true Prophets use a Sign, then will <hi>Zedekiah</hi> make him hornes too, and say, <hi>When went the Spirit from me to thee, 1 Kings</hi> 22. 11. all which God doth suffer to draw us to true and sound knowledge, without which we cannot stand, but shall be shaken to and fro with doubts and fears most unfit for Believers, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. Let this Comfort Gods Ministers in the midst of all contempts, that God is able to force the wicked to the acknowledgement of him and them. In their extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities they shall acknowledge our Callings, justifie our Love, and wish our Prayers. Thus many (who at other times regard not Ministers) either going to Sea, or to Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, or being fick or vexed at home, will send and seek for the Prayers of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. And what is this but a sign of Gods omnipotent hand over all <hi>Pharaohs</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, and that he can revenge our contempts, and give our truth and careful walking in our places a due regard and reverence when he will with them and in them. But here it may be demanded, Why did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> call now for <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> rather than in the former Plague? Why, because this Plague touched him nearer than the former. When the Rivers were Bloud he might have Wine to drink, and so not feel the smart of that Plague. Whence we see, that howbeit other mens harmes should affect us, yet unless the Lord touch our selves we are dull and dead without sense. Which certainly makes God reach us a blow many times, when otherwise he would spare us; did we make but use of other mens miseries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. Wicked men do not only deferre their Duties from day to day, but put over others also that offer good things unto them. As for instance; if a Preacher tender his service this Sunday, he is told, the next will be farre more fit, and if he come the next Sunday, then is either the Master from home, the Gentlewoman sick, the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too hot or cold, or some such thing, that be <hi>Moses</hi> never so ready, yet <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is not ready, but to morrow, to morrow is still the Song, till the Lord strike, and all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows end in their eternal torment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. The Lord could have taken the Frogs quite away; but this was done to shew the truth of the Miracle, that they were Frogs indeed, and no Inchantments, thereby to meet with the unbelief of the King and his Courtiers. And thus by one means or other the Lord will evermore deliver his Truth from false surmises, his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ministers from false imputations, and write the wickedness of carnal men upon their faces to their own confusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. See the corruption of our Nature if God work not: No sooner is the Rod off, but wretched man fals to his old sins again. When we are sick or distressed any way, we pretend Repentance, we pray, we cry, we vow. But forasmuch as all riseth from Fear and not from Love, it vanisheth as soon as the Fear is past, and the Devil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns with seven worse than himself, making our end more odious than ever our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. It had been as easie for the Lord to have turned the dust into Lions and Bears, and Wolves, but that rather he chose to confound pride by weakness, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling humour by so base a Creature. Then secondly let us consider, that if God can
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:36907:51"/>
make so vile a Creature too strong for a Kingdome, what resistance can I a single man make against Gods wrath, if I pull it upon me by my sins. His wrath can arme all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth against me, and yet the least of them is far above my power, as you see here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. The Devil is powerful when God will suffer him, but when God will restrain him what can he do? Add this to the story of <hi>Iob,</hi> to the story of the Heard of Swine in the Gospel, and from such places let us take comfort against our spiritual Enemy; for we see his weakness, and the brideling hand of God at all times upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. The wicked, who for a time make shew as if God were on their side, in Gods good time shall be forced to acknowledge the contrary, to his Glory, and the great Comfort of his Church and Children. For what did these Magicians in effect say, but that this which was now done passeth our Skill, and albeit the Creature be vile and base, yet is the Power of God such over us and our Art, that we cannot do the like, but give him the Victory, and acknowledge our selves sinful, weak, and wicked men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 23. Whensoever we are free from any calamity which happeneth to others, it is not by our own Policy, but by that gracious separation which the Lord makes. How may we run into particulars. Others sickly, we healthy; others in prison, we at liberty; others in blindness, we in light; others slandered, we not touch'd; others cross'd in their Children and Friends, we comforted. O blessed God, what a separation is this? How ought we to be thankful to thee for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 28. Worldly minded men will be content to tolerate Religion, so it might still be joyned with their profit: But if it be contrary to that, O how bitter then, how hard to endure it? For these <hi>Iews</hi> wholly to depart from <hi>Egypt</hi> was not for <hi>Pharaohs</hi> profit, for from their labours he had great gain, and therefore by no means may they go out of his Land to sacrifice to their God, but in the Land he is content to endure it, so he may be freed from those Plagues that were upon him; Or if needs must be that they must go out of the Land, yet not far in any case.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. GOD punisheth sinners first with one Rod, then with another, and if these single chastisements will not serve, then will he go to many Plagues, heaping Wrath upon Wrath, and Plague upon Plague, yea he will lay even all his Plagues upon us at once, as he here speaks, to our utter confusion, as also it is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 15. Secondly, God cals them here his Plagues, so that neither fortune nor chance ruleth Rods and Crosses laid upon us, but these still are Gods, laid on and taken off at his pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ib. Upon the heart,</hi> that is, inwardly and deeply: to smite us in armes, hands, legs, is greivous unto us, but when sorrow is laid upon the heart, it sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth indeed and most bitterly, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 22. &amp; 15. 13. Now the best way to prevent this doleful sorrow of heart, laid on by an angry God, is to take our sins to heart betimes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 23. Whether we be hindered or furthered by weather, let us cast up our eyes to Heaven, for it is the Lord still that ruleth these things, and by his Will they come and go. Nature is his Servant, and the Devil his Rod, neither of them working but as he appoints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 24. Fire was mingled with Hail, to teach, that Gods Judgements shall not be single, but even one upon the neck of another, until we be either humbled or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. Who would think it possible, that any Soul should be secure in the midst
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:36907:51"/>
of such variety of Judgements. To what a height of obduration will sin lead a man, and of all sins incredulity. Amongst all these Stormes <hi>Pharaoh</hi> sleepeth till the voice of Gods mighty Thunders and Hail mixed with Fire rouz'd him up a little.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 28. Pharaoh</hi> here as one betwixt sleeping and waking starts up a little, and sayes, <hi>God is righteous, and I am wicked; Moses pray for us;</hi> and presently layes down his head again. God hath no sooner done thundering than he hath done fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. All this while you never find him careful to prevent any one evil, but desirous still to shift it off when he seeks it, never holds constant to any good motion, never prayes for himself, but carelesly wils <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to pray for him, never yields God his whole Demands, but higleth and dodgeth like some hard Chapman that would get a release with the cheapest. Wheresoever meer Nature is, she is still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant in all her purposes, sensible of present evil, and improvident of future good.</p>

                  <hi>Verse.</hi> 2. AS this teacheth us the end of Gods Works and Wonders, so the Duty and Office of all Christian Parents and Governours, even to teach their Children, and charge carefully and zealously by them and in them to know the Lord, as also <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6. thus is God himself the Author of that catechising and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing of Youth which is so much neglected in our daies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. The drift of all Crosses and Afflictions in this life is to bring down the swelling pride of our sinful hearts, that yeilding God what is due to him, we again may from him reap mercy and forgiveness to our endless comfort. Never forget this saying to King <hi>Iosiah, 2 Chron. 34. 27. Because thine heart was tender,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. So old is the Accusation, which to this day remains among wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, ascribing unto Religion and the Professors thereof whatsoever evil happeneth among men, be it Death, Sickness, Wars, Famine. Thus <hi>Ahab</hi> tels <hi>Elias,</hi> that it was he that troubled <hi>Israel,</hi> by whom indeed all <hi>Israel</hi> had a Blessing if they had known it. But to prove the contrary, read <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 32. Houses and whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes have been saved but for one righteous man dwelling therein, as <hi>Ioseph, Daniel,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8, &amp; 9. Observe Sathans Malice here against Gods Church and Service, if they cannot wholly destroy it, hurt it and hinder it, then in part, as farre as they can, they will do it. Secondly, By the answer of <hi>Moses</hi> note on the other side, that we must not yield an inch to these plots and fetches of the wicked, but zealously must stand to the full observance of all Gods Will, according to his Commandement, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fancies either of others or of our selves. Where the Lord dispenseth not, we must not dispense, where all are bound to depart out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> we must not capitulate for some to go and some to stay. Families should think upon this, where the Husband goes to Church but not the Wife, the Father but not the Son, the Servant but not the Master. <hi>Moses</hi> would not do thus here, but knowing all to be bound, requireth all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 23. This was most wonderful: The houses of the <hi>Egpptians</hi> and <hi>Israelites</hi> joyning as it should seem one close to another, as ours in these dayes do. For else why was that sign given to the destroying Angel, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 23. If all the <hi>Israelites</hi> had dwelt by themselves, and had not been mingled with the <hi>Egyptians?</hi> How able then is our God may we think, who can thus make a separation betwixt his Children and the wicked, when he executed wrath, though they be in one Field, in one House, in one Bed together, yet he can chuse the one and refuse the other. Fear we not then in the time of Plague, or War, or other publick Calamity, left we should perish with the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:36907:52"/>
wicked hand over head, but remember this place; and say in your heart with comfort, O Lord I know thou canst make a separation in this calamity, as thou didst in that cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity betwixt the <hi>Israelites</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> therefore I beseech thee save me from this Sword of thine, and let the light of thy Mercy shine about my dwelling, as thy cheerful light did about the <hi>Israelites.</hi>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. THis ever was and ever will be Gods course, first by gentle means to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, then in the end by Power and Judgement to compel, when the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer course will not serve. In the old World, when the People would not be reformed, the Lord said, <hi>His Spirit should no longer strive with man,</hi> meaning in lenity and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness, as until then it had done, but now he would bring upon them one Plague more, as here upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> and this was the Floud, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 17. When <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> would not be warned by any wayes of Mercy used by a gracious God unto them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, then that one Plague more of Fire and Brimstone came from Heaven. Thus also the Lord deals with us: First he entreats us by his Word the mildest way that can be: Then if this will not serve, the Lord comes nearer and layeth upon us his easier crosses, and then greater. Our Friends grow unkind, our Servants unfaithful, our Children undutiful, our Estate wastes, and our Health is chang'd to Sickness. And if all these work not upon us, then the Lord goes to his Quiver, and takes out a strong Arrow to shoot at us, as the sweating Sickness, the devouring Plague, which shall sweep the Land clean from such rebelling Spirits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. As the wicked stand in awe of God often, and outwardly profess affection to him, yet do not subject themselves to his Will; so are his Servants honoured also of men with an inward conceit of them that they are honest men, when yet their Doctrine will not be yielded unto. Thus doth God inwardly imprint their own damnation in their hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. No Honours or Riches, no Friends or Strength, no Pomp or Port in this World may defend from God, but he will smite all Degrees, and therefore let all Degrees profit by it.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. CHrist is not divided into divers Houses and Families, Kingdoms and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but he doth unite and gather divers Houses and Nations to make one Church, even as here many did eat one Lamb. We may not divide the Lamb, but we must gather our selves to the Lamb; and that is the true Church where People are so gathered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. This keeping of it from the tenth to the fourteenth day, served to prepare their hearts to the right eating of it, being a remembrance before their eyes those four dayes before; and also to prefigure unto us with what meditation and preparation we ought to come to the eating of the true Pass-over in the blessed Sacrament, whereof this same was but a shadow. Secondly, the fourteenrh day this Lamb was offered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then the Moon being at full, and rising in her full light when the Sun was set, thereby might be shadowed, that the Church, usually signified by the Moon, riseth with light in great fulness after the setting of the Sun, the Death of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. This shews the effect and vertue of Christ his bloud, the true Paschal Lamb, ever to save from the destroying Angel as many as shall be sprinkled with it, that is, should make particular application of it to themselves. For it is not the bloud without
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:36907:52"/>
sprinkling will help: Christ died for all sufficiently, but not effectually, because all take not hold of, and apply Christs death to their souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 32. Pharaoh</hi> desires to be blessed of those men, who but even now were odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his eyes.

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 34. Egypt</hi> was never so stubborn in denying passage to <hi>Israel,</hi> as now impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate to entreat it. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did not more force them to stay before, then now to depart, whom lately they would not permit now they hire to go. The <hi>Israelites</hi> are equally glad of this hast. Who would not be ready to go, yea to fly out of the house of bondage. They have what they wished, there was no staying for a second invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The losse of an opportunity is many times irrecoverable. The love of their liberty made the burthen of their Dough light: Who knew whether the variable mind of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> might return to a denial, and after all his stubbornness repent of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. It is foolish to hazard, where there is certainty of good offers, and uncertainty of continuance.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 36. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> rich Jewels of Silver and Gold were not too dear for the <hi>Israelites</hi> whom they hated; how much rather had they need to send them away weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, then to have them stay to be their Executors. Their love to themselves obtain'd the inriching of their Enemies; and now they are glad to pay them well for their old work, and their present journey. Gods People had stayed like Slaves, they go away like Conquerors with the spoil of those that hated them, arm'd for security, and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy for maintenance.</p>

These followed the prosperity hoped for in the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who they saw were not touched with the Plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and rightly set forth what after fell out, and ever will, that Christ shall be followed of many for the Loaves, and his Gospel em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced for the prosperity and peace that often he vouchsafeth unto it.</p>

This may comfort us in our spiritual fears and conflicts, that certainly the Lord will never fail in any Promise, but even dayes and hours of comfort fit for his Children, as they are known to him, so are they observed of him most graciously and most precisely. Why then, must I needs tie the Lord to my time, to my will, or else I shall speak or think amiss, that the Lord hath forgotten and forsaken me, and all that the Devil, my sworn Enemy, suggesteth is true?</p>

Your weakness is known unto God, what you can bear, and what you cannot, what will lead you to the Land of Promise, and what will make you turn back to <hi>Egypt.</hi> Secondly, in that the Lord would not suffer them to passe by the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listims,</hi> least they should start back, and so sin greivously against him: What if in like sort he prevent my sinning, and your sinning against him, by taking away from us such things as he in his Wisdome knows would be the occasions of evil to us if we had them, as Riches, Friends, Power, Health of Body, Peace of mind, and the like. But could not God have stayed them from returning, although they had gone the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer way? <hi>Cyril</hi> in <hi>Exodus</hi> answereth, God doth not work all things as he can, but sometimes doth avoid evils after the manner of men, therein teaching us to do the like, namely, by using meanes even then when most plainly we have God our helper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. This may teach us wariness and circumspection in our Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ever reckoning of the Enemy in this our holy March towards the Land of Promise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. Consider in the Cloud how it not only directed the way, but was spread, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith, for a Covering, namely, against the heat of the Sun, comfortably cooling and refreshing them. Remember also how the afflictions of this World are in the Gospel noted by the heat of the Sun, and be you assured, that ever against these heats the Lord in his good time will send you defence and comfort, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3. the last words put us in mind, that in travelling towards the spiritual <hi>Canaan</hi> we must not rest, but labour forward continually. The Children of this World are often look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back toward <hi>Egypt,</hi> and often pitch down their Tents so in this Wilderness, that they are loth ever to take them up and to remove. But the Sons of God say within themselves, <hi>We have here no abiding City,</hi> and fixing both eye and heart on their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly house, they journey on still both day and night in true piety and obedience till they come thither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. Let this ever assure your fainting hearts, that Gods Providence cooling and comforting, shining and lighting, guiding and directing his little Flock, shall never be taken away from any member of it, but ever be present with us both by day and night, to the eternal praise of his Goodness, and unspeakable comfort of our souls. And further you may observe from hence the admirable Wisdom of Gods Providence, that sits and sorts out his Mercies for his Children, and makes every Favour and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing proper for every necessity. He that afterwards led the Wise-men by a Star, led <hi>Israel</hi> here by a Cloud: That was an higher Object, therefore he gives them an higher and more heavenly Conduct; this was more earthy, therefore he contents himself with a lower representation of his presence: A Pillar of Cloud and Fire; a Pillar for firmness, of Cloud and Fire for visibility and use. The greater light extinguisheth the lesse, therefore in the Day he shews them not Fire, but a Cloud: in the Night no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is seen without light, therefore he shews them not the Cloud, but Fire: The Cloud shelters them from heat by Day, the Fire digests the rawness of the Night. The same God is both a Cloud and a Fire to his Children, ever putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into those Formes of gracious Respects that may best fit their neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. VVE must not fear in every adversity before we see the end, but reason thus with our selves. Lo here I am distressed on every side, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> were at the red Sea, and it is the Providence of God, that I should be thus, as it was his will that they should pitch in that place. But do I know the Lords meaning, and what he will do? And therefore I will patiently wait his blessed Will, not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did, but comfortably assuring my self, that one way or other the Lord will give Issue to his Glory and my Good; and deliver me also as he did these <hi>Israelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. When the destruction of the wicked is at hand, the Lord offereth them some bait or other to put them on. So was <hi>Ahab</hi> drawn to his end with a desire to recover <hi>Ramoth Gilead</hi> which once was his, the bait allured him, the wrath of God slew him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. So were <hi>Senacherib</hi> and the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> baited with former success, with their multitude and the smalness of <hi>Hezekia's</hi> number: But how gloriously did the Lord deliver his, and destroy them that boasted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. How quickly the wicked repent them of their good, but seldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of their evil, for to let them go was good, and yet they repented, but to pursue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them was evil, and yet they repented not. Many such there be in these dayes, who grieve at an hour spent in the Church, but never of dayes and years spent in sin. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, observe that when we are once delivered out of spiritual <hi>Egypt,</hi> then doth the Devil muster up his Chariots and Horse-men. He cannot abide to loose his Servants, so his we were, and he hath lost us, and his we must be again, if by all his strength he can possibly gain us. A Land that floweth with Milk and Honey may not be inherited with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out resistance. Out of <hi>Egypt</hi> we may be delivered, but from following persecutions we shall not be quite freed. Think of that Devil in the Gospel, who when he must needs depart and loose his possession, did rend and tear the poor party most miserably, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. In all spiritual Conflicts say thus with your self: O my soul fear not, though Sathan thrust sore at thee, and seek thy destruction, but look unto him that is mightier than all Hell, believe his Promises, believe his Word, and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> whom thou hast seen to day thou shalt never see again, that is, those frights and those fears, Enemies to thy peace, thou shalt never be troubled with them any more, but God shall so drown them in the red Sea of Christs bloud, that they shall never hurt thee. The Lord shall fight for thee, O my Soul, therefore stand still and wait upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. A Silence before, a not praying, hath not alwayes a fault in it, because we are often ignorant of our own necessities, and ignorant of the dangers that hang over us; but a silence after a benefit evidently received, a dumb ingratitude is inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable. Thus when <hi>Moses</hi> sayes here to his People, <hi>The Lord shall fight for you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Moses</hi> means you shall not need to speak, the Lord will do it for his own glory, you may be silent. There it was a future thing; but the Lord hath fought many battels for us; he hath fought for our Church against Schisms and Heresie, for our Land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Invasion, for every soul against Presumption, or else against Desperation; <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus pugnavit &amp; nos filemus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. See the force of Prayer, though it be but in groans of your heart, it even crieth in Gods ears it pierceth the Heavens, and pulleth down comfort, See likewise the duty of all faithful Servants of God to go forward, as here is said to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> notwithstanding Seas before us, Hils about us, and whatsoever it may be that is against us, leaving all to the Lord, who knoweth his own purpose, and will manifest the same in his good time. Forward, forward, saith God here, <hi>Speak to the Children of Israel that they go forward,</hi> But why did <hi>Moses</hi> cry thus in his heart to God when it was
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:36907:54"/>
revealed to him, what should be the end of the <hi>Egyptians?</hi> Because neither Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises nor Revelations hinder Gods Children from using ordinary means, but do rather stirre them up more and more to beg and crave the performance and effect of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. If you look at the Waters on either side you may see the condition of Gods Children in this World, beset on the right side with a Floud of Prosperity, and beset on the left side with a floud of Adversity: And yet through a true Faith walking through both, and hurt by neither, they arrive on the other side safely, when by either of these many others are destroyed: pray then for this Faith.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. TIs a good form of giving thanks, when every particular person out of his own feeling sayes, I, I, good Lord, do yield unto thy Majesty my bounden thanks, for my self and for my Brethren, for my self, and for thy whole Church, and so every one feeling, and every one thanking, the Lord is praised of all, as his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and goodness reach to all. Thus <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 118. 28. I, I again in my own person, and with my own heart, and with my own tongue. So here, <hi>I will sing,</hi> when they were many thousands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 5. They sank as a stone,</hi> that is, without all recovery and help. For a stone swimmeth not out, being cast in, but goeth to the bottom, and there abideth. Fearful and very fearful was their destruction, to the terror of all those that shall persecute the Church of God and his People,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. Not our Vertue, not our Merits, not our Armies or men of Might. Gods Servants do never rob him and cloath themselves, but with <hi>Moses</hi> here they give all to God, where indeed it is due, and say with <hi>David, Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy Name give the praise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. In that they are said to have risen against God, when they rose but against his People, observe the Union between God and his Church, even such, as who so toucheth the one toucheth the other. <hi>For he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye, Zach.</hi> 2. 8. And <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me;</hi> me in my members, and by my members.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. The same ambition and covetousness that made <hi>Pharaoh</hi> wear out so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Judgements will not leave him till it hath wrought out his full destruction. All Gods Vengeances have their end, the final perdition of his Enemies; which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rest till they have attained. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> therefore and his <hi>Egyptians</hi> will needs go fetch their Bane instead of their Victory: They bragg'd of their Conquest before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and gave <hi>Israel</hi> either for Spoil or Bondage. But the Sea will shew them, that it regards the Rod of <hi>Moses,</hi> not the Scepter of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and therefore in the next verse, as glad to have got the Enemies of God at such an advantage, shuts her mouth upon them. Extraordinary favours to wicked men are the fore-runners to their ruine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. As the Act of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for drowning the <hi>Israelitish</hi> Children was cruel, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. so is their own issue and punishment but just here. The People must drown their Males there, themselves are drown'd here; they died by the same means, by which they caused the poor <hi>Israelitish</hi> Infants to die: That Law of Retaliation which God will not allow to us, because we are fellow-creatures, he justly practiseth on us. God would have us read our sins in our judgements, that we might both repent of our sins, and give Glory to his Justice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. In common Duties due to God none must sit out. The deliverance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd both Sexes, and therefore both Sexes were to thank God for it, Man and Wife
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:36907:54"/>
must joyn and agree together, to honour him that saveth them. <hi>Ioseph</hi> will go up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> according to the Law, and <hi>Mary</hi> his Wife will go with him. No division, no difference betwixt them in Gods matters. If the one owe a Duty, the other thinks she doth so too, and with one heart, according to one rule, they both worship God, and so come home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 24. A fitter course it had been for a People so taught with passed Favours, to have assured themselves of future helps in Gods good time, and with Patience and Faith to have expected the same. <hi>Remember,</hi> said our Saviour, <hi>how many baskets full of broken meat were taken up,</hi> and never to fear any want where such a powerful God is. To remember what God hath done for me, and to make it an argument both of my Prayer and Hope with <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 4. 1. and with <hi>Iob, chap.</hi> 13. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 25. Such vertue was in the Wood, given to it by God: first, that he might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by this means his Love and Goodness to us much more, when he maketh all his Creatures serve to our Health and Good, and so to stir us up to true thankfulness unto him for it. Secondly, that he might teach us thus not to abuse those his Creatures, which with so excellent Vertues and Qualities are created for us to do us good. Thirdly, that we might learn by this means not to contemn second causes and means, by abusing, through presumption, the holy Doctrine of Gods Providence. For When God himself is pleased to use these Instruments, who are we that we should reject them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 27. Thus cometh Comfort after Sorrow, and Plenty after Scarcity: And surely the Tryals of the Church, or of any particular Member therein, shall have a joyful end, and though they be never so many, yet the Lord delivereth out of them all; who would not trust then in such a God, and tarry his time that never faileth.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. THe time is named, <hi>the fifteenth day,</hi> to let us know, that their ingratitude was so much the more detestable, by how much the remembrance of so great and wonderful a deliverance from their Enemies was more fresh in memory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so late. Therefore let us think in the morning of our safety by Gods Mercy all the night, and at night of our safety all the day, which unlesse I be thankful for, I must needs be a great Offender, seeing it is not possible to plead forgetfulness in such fresh and new things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. The Gospel is welcome to many at the first, and they greatly rejoyce in it, but when either trouble groweth for it, or they are restrained by it from their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed sins of Swearing, Drunkenness, Sensuality, Covetousness, and such like, then they wish they had never been troubled with such preaching, and all Gods Mercy is returned to him with great unthankfulness, as here it was of these murmuring <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi> And thus likewise in Matches and Marriages, O what impiety is in many, many times cursing the parties, and almost cursing God that gave them such a Match, when yet at the beginning all was well, and every body pleased. Secondly, this murmuring of the <hi>Israelites</hi> may shew us what is the course of too many in the world, even to prefer the Flesh-pots of <hi>Egypt</hi> before the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and bellies full of Bread before a blessed Deliverance out of cruel bondage, that is, Earth before Heaven, and the Joyes of this World before those of the next. Such were those in <hi>Ier.</hi> 44. 16, 17, 18. who measured Religion by plenty and scarcity, judging that best which brought most profit, and that worst wherein there was any want.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. God is not tied to ordinary Means, nor our maintenance to the Fruits of the Earth. The Ravens shall both find Meat and bring Meat to <hi>Eliah</hi> if God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and a little Oil shall continue running till many Vessels are full, if he so please. <hi>Iacob</hi> was provided for in that extream Famine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 11. and Gold was brought
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:36907:55"/>
to <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> from far when they little thought on it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 11. Lift up your thoughts therefore above the course of Nature when you think upon God, and although you have neither Bread nor Money, nor the whole Land any Corn, yet past Hope take hold on Hope, and leave God to himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. Murmuring against Gods Ministers is murmuring against God: <hi>They have not cast thee away but me away,</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 7. And <hi>he that despiseth you despiseth me,</hi> said Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. As God doth something for his part towards our maintenance, so likewise must we do something on our parts. He will give Manna, but we must go out and gather it. He will provide Meat, and Money, and Cloth, and whatever is good for us, but we must labour in some honest Vocation, and so come by these things. Corn he will give to the Husband-man, but conditionally, that he plow and sow. Idleness he will not endure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. God doth here restrain the covetous, who are never satisfied, and withall comfort his own Children, who have not such heaps. For what hath the greatest Raker that lives among us but a subsistance, and hath not the poorest man as much? God will make my little stretch out to an Omer, that is, to enough, and his much shall be no more doe what he can.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. We must take time while time serves. We have a Morning, and we have an Evening; our able Youth and good Health is our Morning, our Age and sick estate is our Evening. Spend not the first vainly, and you shall not want in the last. Work in the Morning, and we shall eat the fruit of our labours when the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Age and Sickness comes. Gods Blessings are not at our election, to have them when we will, but when we seek and he bids, then we shall find. His Manna is ready if we come in time, but if we linger till we list, he hath his Sun to melt it away, and it is gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 24. It corrupted not.</hi> No more shall any Goods you get and gather with the Will, and good liking, and Commandement of God, that is, truly, and lawfully, and with a good Conscience, but the Lord shall bless that basket and that store to you whilst you live, and to yours when you are gone.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. LEt us in all our wants set our Faces the right way, and look to Heaven not to Earth, to God not to Man. And let us not follow these <hi>Israelites,</hi> who when they wanted Water did not cry unto God, but fly upon <hi>Moses</hi> with an unfitting speech, as though <hi>Moses</hi> were God to create Fountains and Springs. Thus did <hi>Rachel</hi> come upon her Husband, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 1. and so alwayes doth corrupt man, possessed with impatiency, take a wrong course, leave God and run to man, and speak according to his rage, without due consideration of mans ability and power. Only therefore to God we must go in our wants. For there is the Treasury and bottomless Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of all Comforts. Ask there, seek there, knock there, and you have a Promise, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. but run to the Creature and you have none.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. Rely not upon the multitude, nor hunt after the peoples applause. Do not the Scriptures shew us how reverently the Pharisees sent unto <hi>Iohn, Mat.</hi> 11. 18. and yet after affirm'd him to have a Devil, whereupon said our Saviour, <hi>he was, &amp;c. Ioh.</hi> 5. 35. thus all credit is but for a season with worldly men, &amp; with the common People. To day a man, to morrow a beast; to day none better, to morrow none worse; to day a God, to morrow a Devil. Christ and his Apostles found this measure, as well as <hi>Moses</hi> in the Text, ready to be stoned by those that even now, when the Sea was divided, honoured him as a God. You can never give any people so many causes to stick unto, as he did give this people to cleave unto him, and yet they failed.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. No evil in man can drive God from his Promise. And therefore when the Devil shall suggest, that thou art not worthy of Mercy, that thou art so great a sinner God cannot spare thee, therefore trouble him not, hope not in him, for there is no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for such a one; answer, that thou dost not rely upon thine own merit, that thou dost confess all that he saith of thy unworthiness to be most true, but tell him withall, that thou dost look at Gods Promise and consider his Truth, and that thou dost find here and every where, that no evil in man can make him evil by breaking his Promise, and that therefore thou maist not despair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. As the <hi>Israelites</hi> could not travel to the earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but they must fight with <hi>Amaleck</hi> in the way, no more can we travel to our heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fighting with <hi>Amaleck,</hi> the World, the Flesh, and the Devil are fierce <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites,</hi> and they must be fought with and overcome, as <hi>Amaleck</hi> was, or else we shall never see <hi>Canaan.</hi> Poverty, Sickness, Crosses by Children, Slanders, with infinite more, are <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and they stop you in your way to <hi>Canaan,</hi> so that without buckling with them you shall not passe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. We may observe in this the antiquity of Musters and a warrant for them: All did not go here, but some, and those chosen out by a Muster, and view taken by <hi>Ioshua:</hi> We may take notice likewise how full of honour and credit it ever was in these cases to be chosen; which if so, then certainly men should not run away and hide themselves as soon as they hear of a Muster towards, as heretofore they did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. If we receive not what we pray for at first asking, we raint and cease praying streight, not remembring how often we use a Medicine for the body before we can be whole. Let us therefore amend this fault in our Prayer hereafter, and never forget the force of true and godly Prayer. While <hi>Moses</hi> held up his hands, that is, continued praying, so long the <hi>Israelites,</hi> whom he prayed for, prevailed, but when he gave over the Enemy prevailed. Thus will it be in your case, and my case, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that be troubled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. This heaviness of <hi>Moses</hi> hands may teach us the weakness of all flesh in Christian exercises. We cannot hold out and continue as we ought, hut heaviness and dulness will steal upon us, and seek to cool us and hinder us. The help that <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> performed unto him, tels us the benefit of Christian Company in such holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, and the needful duty of praying for him that prayeth for us, that God would be with his Spirit, that is, strengthen him, and quicken him, and aid him, so to pray and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his Prayers, as the end may be to his Glory and our Comfort.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14, &amp; 15. All this hath use to tell us how careful we must be in keeping a Register in our hearts of Gods Mercies and Favours towards us in our selves, in our Friends, in our Country, in our Magistrates, and Ministers, or any way. Examples in this kind are numerous, as of <hi>Deborah, Iudith, Hester, Anna, Mary,</hi> and that cleans'd Leper that return'd to give thanks, the <hi>Israelites</hi> when they pass'd over the red Sea, all these built Altars in their hearts for Gods Favours, by being truly and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently thankful.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. THe hearty joy that was in <hi>Iethro</hi> when he heard what God had done for <hi>Israel,</hi> shews us the right affection of a Child of God when God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to his Church, or to any Member thereof. He envieth not, he grudgeth not, much lesse speaketh ill, but with a very loving joy he is glad, and blesseth the name of the Lord for it.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. After our deliverance from any affliction or danger, there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on our part but to blesse God for that Deliverance. Thus when the <hi>Israelites</hi> were safe on the shore, and saw their dead Enemies come floating after them upon the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:36907:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
billows, they did not cry more loud before than now they sung. Not their Faith but their Sense teacheth them now to magnifie that God after their deliverance, whom they hardly trusted for their deliverance; and thus <hi>Iethro</hi> here blesseth God for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his People. Even Nature taught the very <hi>Gentiles</hi> what both they and Gods own People ought to return for Mercies. And indeed a whole Christians life is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into praying and praifing; if we begin with Petitions, we commonly conclude with Thanksgivings. Thus by an holy craft we insinuate into Gods Favour, driving a trade betwixt Earth and Heaven, receiving and returning, importing one Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that of Mercies, and transporting another, that of Thansgiving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. In this excellent man <hi>Moses Iethro</hi> his inferior by far finds a just fault: which tels us, that no man is perfect in all things, but may receive counsel even from a meaner person. And let <hi>Moses</hi> Modesty in yeilding make our spirits humble in like occasions, where God dwelleth it will be so, and Pride is a sure sign of an ill Heart. The Head scorns not the Foot, and the very Foot is careful for the Head.</p>

When the Lord said to Rulers, <hi>Ye are Gods;</hi> he means not; that they should be like the Epicures idle God, which sate in his Throne, and let all inferior mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alone, as too base for his eyes. Nay rather the Lord would have Judges like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who doth not only weigh Mountains and Hils in his Ballance, but the very dust of the Earth, and sands of the Sea; and therefore he setteth down Judgement for small matters in this verse. And as he saith in <hi>Deuteronomy, Vengeance is mine;</hi> so in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> he descendeth lower, and layeth claim to the Ballance, and telleth us, that all the weights of the bag are the work of the Lord: And who are weaker and lower than the Fatherless, the Widdow, and the Poor; and yet all Judges have the Lords Letters commendatory in their behalf, the tenor whereof is this, <hi>Do right to the Poor and Fatherless.</hi>

                  <hi>Verse.</hi> 7. GOD might have imposed upon them a Law per-force; They were his Creatures; and he could require nothing but Justice. It had been but equal, that they should be compelled to obey their Maker: Yet that God which loves to do all things sweetly, gives the Law of Justice in Mercy, and will not imperiously command but craves our assent for that, which it were rebellion not to do. How gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle should be the proceeding of fellow-creatures, who have an equality of being with an inequality of condition, when their infinite Master requests where he might constrain! God will make no Covenant with the unwilling, how much lesse the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, which stands all upon Love. If we stay till God offer violence to our will, or to us against our will, we shall die Strangers from him. The Church is the Spouse of Christ, he will enjoy her Love by a willing Contract, not by a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishment; the obstinate have nothing to do with God, the title of all Converts is a willing people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. This shews how careful great Ones should be to grace and countenance the Ministers of the Word before the People, to the end their words may have more weight with their Hearers, and their service and pains do more good. But now it is farre otherwise with too many. For great men must shew their greatness in disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Lords Prophets, and meaner men shew their malice in spreading false rumors of them.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. Those Garments must be washed which should never wax old, that now they might begin their age in purity, as those which were in more danger of being foul than bare. The danger was neither in their Garments nor their Skin; yet they must be wash'd, that they might learn by their clothes with what Souls to appear before their God. For little would neatness of Vestures avail them with a filthy Soul. The
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:36907:56"/>
God of Spirits looks to the inner man, and challenges the purity of that part which resembles himself; <hi>Cleanse your hands you sinners, and purge your hearts ye double minded.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. We are all by our corruption most unfit profitably to hear the Word of God, unless we be sanctified and prepared thereunto by the Spirit of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to make ready for so holy a work by all due care before-hand, and to purge our hearts from all cares, troubles and impediments whatsoever. The Word of God is not to be handled with unclean hands, neither will enter into unclean hearers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. A good way to make a profitable hearer is, first to shake him and throw him down in himself. For then assuredly the Word entreth more powerfully, and he hath a more excellent touch, then without such humbling he would have had: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how St. <hi>Paul</hi> was thrown down, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4. Surely such rushings and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and spiritual frightings in Conscience hath the Lord his gracious meaning in, to beat us down in our selves, that we may more carefully hearken unto him. In sickness, in prison, in poverty, in trouble, men have other ears than they have in prosperity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. Curiosity in matters forbidden is odious unto God, and therefore ver. 12. there were bounds put to the Mount, to shew, that God would have every man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that which it pleaseth him to vouchsafe him of revelation and knowledge. The Lord hath revealed his Will in his Word, and beyond those limits we must not go, having no ear to hear where he hath not a mouth to speak. Secondly, we learn here how profitable the presence of a Magistrate is, to make people keep order. For surely men are marvellous apt to transgress, and therefore again and again they must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished by <hi>Moses.</hi> Give Laws never so good, and let there not be a Governour to see the execution of them, and 'tis too clear what little good such Laws do.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. THere is no judgement that God executes but Mercy is mingled with it: go over any that were executed since the beginning of the World, still there was Mercy in it: but there is Mercy often manifested where there is no Judgement in it. Here is the difference, Judgement is never entire but there is some Mercy in it; Mercy is alwayes entire, and there is no mixture of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all in it. See the effects in regard of extent, God saith, he will punish to the third and fourth Generation, the Fathers upon the Children; that is a long time, but it is nothing to his Mercy, <hi>I will shew Mercy,</hi> sayes God here, <hi>to thousands of Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> A thousand Generations is longer than the World shall last. For there were but forty two Generations from the Creation to Christ: A hundred Generations is like to be longer than the World shall last, yet God will be merciful to thousands of Generations, if it last so long, or if not, he will be so for ever. A large Periphrasis to set forth the Mercy of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. Here you may learn the difference between the Law and the Gospel. The Law fearing and frighting, shaking and shivering the heart of man, beateth down his pride, and makes him cry with the Prodigal Son, <hi>I am not worthy, I am not worthy, O Father, to be called thy Son, Luke</hi> 15. 19. Yea it makes him stand afar off with the poor Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, and smite his breast in true feeling of his sin, and to beseech God for Mercy to a Sinner: But now the Gospel cheereth and comforteth, helpeth and healeth, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allureth to come in all joyful assurance of Mercy, by him who hath fulfill'd the Law for us, and taken away the curse of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. There is a fear acceptable to God, and yet hath in it a trembling, an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, a consternation, an astonishment, an apprehension of Gods dereliction for a time. The Law here was given in thundring and lightning, and the people were afraid. How
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36907:57"/>
proceeds <hi>Moses</hi> with them? <hi>Fear not,</hi> saith he, <hi>for God is come to prove you, that his fear might be before your eyes.</hi> Here is a fear not, that is, fear not with despair, nor with diffidence, but yet therefore that you may fear the Law: For in this place the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Law its self which is given to direct them is called fear; as in another place God himself is call'd Fear, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. (as he is in other places called Love too) <hi>Iacob</hi> swore by the fear of his Father <hi>Isaac, i. e.</hi> by him whom his Father <hi>Isaac</hi> fear'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 24. God who was never visible to mortal eye, was pleas'd to make himself presential by substitution of his Name, that is, in certain places he hath appointed that his Name shall be called upon; and by promising and imparting such Blessings, which he hath made consequent to the invocation of his Name, hath made such places to be a certain determination of some special manner of his presence. For Gods Name is not a distinct thing from himself; not an Idea, and it cannot be put into a place in lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral signification; the expression is to be resolved into some other sense: Gods Name is that whereby he is known, by which he is invocated, that which is the immediate publication of his Essence: And because God is essentially present in all places, when he makes himself present in one place more than another, it cannot be understood to any other purpose, but that in such places he gives special Blessings and Graces; or that in those places he appoints his Name, that is, himself specially to be invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</p>

THe boaring of his ear was a sign of obedience, and figuratively admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Servants must not be deaf, but quick, and ready, and willing, to hear what is commanded them. And spiritually, that if we be the Lords Servants, he boreth by his holy Grace our Ear, that is, he maketh us have Ears to hear his holy Word, not to cast it behind our Backs, and stop our Eares against it; but with Care, and Zeal, and Love we hearken to it as Men and Women whose Eares he hath opened and bored.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. Although the worst men will make use of Gods Altar for their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and many will cling fast to it in their extremity, who in their welfare regarded it not; yet the Altar of God must be no Sanctuary for presumptuous Murtherers. And indeed what have bloody hands to do with the holy innocent Altar of God: Miserable Murtherers, what help can ye expect from that sacred Pile: Those Horns that were sprinkled by the bloud of Beasts abhorre to be touch'd by the bloud of Men: Gods Altar is for the expiation of sin by bloud, not for the protection of the sin of bloud. And this was <hi>Ioabs</hi> Case, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. who fled to the Horns of the Altar, and told <hi>Benaiah</hi> that he would die there, but young <hi>Solomon</hi> was so well acquainted with this Law of God, that he sticks not at the killing of <hi>Ioab</hi> even there. For he knew <hi>Ioabs</hi> Murthers had not been more presumptuous then guiltful; and therefore he sends <hi>Benaiah</hi> to take away the Offender both from God and Men, from the Altar and the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. God doth not say, he that killeth Father or Mother shall be killed for it, but <hi>he that smiteth,</hi> so that not so much as a blow is to be given to Parents upon pain of death, no not with the tongue may we smite them: so great is the honour of Parents before God, and so sharp a Judge is God against all abusers of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 17. He that curseth Father or Mother shall surely die,</hi> saith <hi>Moses</hi> here; and <hi>he that is but stubborn towards them shall die,</hi> saith the same Prophet, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 18. The dutiful love of Children to Parents is so rooted in Nature, that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> saith, That it is against the impressions, and against the Law of Nature, for any Child ever to love that man that hath done execution upon his Father, though by way of Justice. And this natural Obligation is not condition'd with the limitations of a

                  <hi>Verse 9. THe Cause shall be brought before the Iudges,</hi> saith our English Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in the Hebrew it is, <hi>before the Gods.</hi> For Magistrates in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are call'd Gods. First, by Analogie, saith <hi>Theodoret,</hi> as resembling God by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the power of Life and Death. Secondly, by Participation, saith Saint <hi>Austin:</hi> for as Stars participate their light from the Sun, so do Rulers their Authority from the Supream Majesty. Thirdly, by Deputation from God, whose Vicegerent they are, and to whom they must be accountable for their evil administration. Magistrates then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the place of God, and entrusted with his Power, must have a care that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present not God to the World as a corrupt, crooked, and unrighteous Judge. As they are invested with his Name, let them indeavour to express his Nature, to be both just and merciful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. In all Oaths God is the chief Witness, as in all Judicatures he is the chief Judge: and therefore it is call'd here, <hi>the Oath of the Lord:</hi> first because God is call'd in as the chief Witness and Avenger. Have a care therefore what thou swearest: for thou art in the presence of thy Creator, who can strike thee both dumb and dead. He that made thy Mouth made it for his Glory; and if thou turnest that Glory into a Lie, know that God will be sure to avenge his own Oath, and his own Glory. Secondly, it is called <hi>the Oath of God</hi> in this Text, because it is taken in his presence. For God is Present and President by a particular Providence, as Lord Paramount, and chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, higher than the Highest. And therefore the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Judges do ever leave the chief Seat of Judicature empty; as being Gods Place, where he stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or sitteth himself to behold the Actions and Affections of the Court, and to passe a Censure as well upon the Judge as the Prisoner or Witness.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. Every Marriage before it be knit should be contracted, as it is here, and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 28. which stay between the Contract and the Marriage was the time of longing for their Affection to settle in; because the deferring of what we love doth kindle the desire; which if it came easily and speedily unto us, we set lesse by it. Therefore we read, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were contracted before married. In the Contract Christ was conceived, in the Marriage born, that he might honour both Estates.</p>

But (it is St. <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> Exclamation) will any wash in foul Water for sore Eyes? Will any man embalm the Carcass of the World, which he treads under foot, with those tears which should embalm his Soul?

IF to give the hearing be in some sort to put to the hand, surely to have itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ears, to hear evil Reports of our Christian Brethren with delight and contentment, to believe them is to put to the hand much more. Yet what so common in our Mouths, as I am not the Author, I am not the first Raiser, I heard it, I have my Author. God that made this Law against receiving, knoweth that hearing goeth before receiving, and if not receive, then not hear, not believe, not report to others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. If this may not be done in civil Matters, much lesse may it be done in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and matters of Faith. The words are plain, <hi>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil,</hi> therefore a multitude may erre and do evil; <hi>Neither decline after many to overthrow truth,</hi> therefore a multitude may overthrow truth.

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. Gods Actions are general and particular, general to all men, particular to his Friends: So must ours be. As therefore by his general Action he suffereth the Sun to shine upon the bad as well as good, so must we extend our Love, which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bond of Mankind, as well to our Enemies as to our Friends, by which common Love all hurting of the Bodies or Goods of our Enemies is forbid. Again, as God hath his special Action to his Friends and his Church, namely, sanctification; so must Friendship, which is our special Action, reach its self to such only as are of the Houshold of Faith. For although we must love with that general Love all Mankind, <hi>Turks, Pagans,</hi> yet to such may we not be Friends and Familiars, but must beware of inward and usual conversation, with them that hate God and all his Graces. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction tels you the meaning of <hi>Mat. 5. 44. Love your enemies.</hi>

And therefore if thou see one of his Sheep, one of thy fellow Christians strayed into sins of infirmity, joyn him with thine own Soul in thy Prayers to God. Relieve him, if what he needs be spiritual, with thy Prayers for him, and relieve him, if his wants be of another kind, according to his Prayers to thee. Why should not he that is made of the same bloud, and redeem'd with the same bloud as thou art, why should not he prevail with thee so far as to the obtaining of an Almes, when some fellow-servant of thine hath had that interest in God, as by his intercession and Prayers to advance thy Salvation? wilt not thou save the life of another man that prayes to thee, when perchance thy Soul hath been saved by another man that prayed for thee.</p>

IT is better not to promise than not to keep promise, the people of the <hi>Iews</hi> were signified by the Locusts, which suddenly leap up, and forthwith fall down to the earth again. They did as it were leap up, when in words they promised to do all things which the Lord had said, but they fell to the earth again, when in their deeds they denied the same. Let us therefore alwayes weigh our weakness, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly frame our promises: for as we see in this people, we may purpose well that which we cannot so well perform.</p>

It is not many weeks since <hi>Israel</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in which space God had cherished their Faith by several Wonders; yet now he thinks it time to give them Statutes from Heaven as well as Bread. The Manna and Water from the Rock (which was Christ in the Gospel) were given before the Law; the Sacraments of Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the legal Covenant. The Grace of God preventeth our obedience; therefore should we keep the Law of God, because we have a Saviour. O the Mercy of God, which before we see what we are bound to do, shews us our remedy if we do it not: How can our Faith disanul the Law, when it was before it? It may help to fulfil that which shall be, it cannot frustrate that which was not. The Letter which God had written in our fleshly Tables, were now (as some that were carved in some Barks) almost grown out; he saw it time to write them in dead Tables, whose hardness should not be capable of alteration: He knew that the stone would be more faithful than our hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. Ministers, whether Civil or Ecclesiastical, are not to leave their charge without Deputies. When <hi>Moses</hi> here ascended he left <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> with the people, that whosoever had any matter might come to them: So watchful and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was <hi>Moses</hi> in his place, that without just cause he is not absent, and then he leaveth able Deputies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 16. Moses</hi> ascending was not admitted to God till after six dayes, to teach all men patiently and reverently to tarry Gods leisure and gracious pleasure for any matter of his Will to be revealed to them, not curiously searching, but humbly waiting for the thing we seek, being fit for us. At the end of six dayes God called to <hi>Moses.</hi> So will the Lord have a comfortable time for all those that wait for him, they shall see and hear at last what he will say unto them. But then they must come to God in the Cloud, that is, in the humanity of Christ, whereof this Cloud was a Figure. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him there is no access to God, and by him we come and that boldly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. God appears here like a consuming Fire in the eyes of the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> but to them whom he drew to him he appeared as a pleasant Saphire, verse 10. Just so to carnal men, and to such as are his, called by his holy Spirit, there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of him, the one seeing with fear and trembling, the other seeing feeling and tasting Joy and Comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 18. Moses</hi> was with God forty dayes and nights without any repast. That God that sent the Quails to the Host of <hi>Israel,</hi> and Manna from Heaven, could have fed him with dainties if he had so pleas'd. But there is no life to the life of Faith; <hi>Man lives not by bread only:</hi> The Vision of God did not only satiate but feast him. What a blessed satiety shall there be when we shall see him as he is, and he shall be all in all to us: Since this very frail Mortality of <hi>Moses</hi> was sustained and comforted but with representations of his presence. Here again, I see <hi>Moses</hi> the Receiver of the Law, <hi>Elias</hi> the Restorer of the Law, Christ the Fulfiller of the Law, all fasting forty dayes. Abstinence prepares best for good Duties. Full bellies are fitter for rest. Hence solemn Prayer takes ever fasting to attend it, and so much the rather speeds in Heaven, when it is so accompanied. Its good so to diet the body that the soul may be fatned.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. THis Offering sheweth, first, that it is the duty of Gods Servants to bestow part of such things as God blesseth them withall towards the maintenance of Gods Spiritual Temple erected with Us, and among Us, by the Preaching of his Word, the Administration of his Sacraments, and all other Offices of the Ministry, to the Salvation of our Souls. Secondly, That our Goods are not ours to waste at our Wills, but God looketh to be honoured with them, employed to good purposes. Lastly, in seeking this Offering, to erect an External Worship: we see that God will be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped outwardly also with our Bodies, as inwardly with our Spirits, for they are both the Lords.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. In the variety and several kindes of what was offered, you have shadowed out unto you the difference of Spiritual Gifts and Graces given by God to Men, for the building up of his Spiritual Temple or Sanctuary in your hearts, and such as God hath given, such must they offer, and such shall be accepted of God; to teach us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise in no man, what God himself accepteth, and despiseth not. In Mans Body the soveraignty is in the Head, the Eyes and Ears, and yet cannot the Eye say to the Foot, <hi>I have no need of thee, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 21. the greater may not despise the less, nor the less murmur against the greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. They offered their Ear-Rings and Jewels, which were Ornaments unto them, teaching us in this, that nothing ought to be so dear unto us which we cannot find in our hearts to bestow willingly to the Service and Honour of God; these things that served for superfluity before, now serve for Gods Tabernacle. Even so should our Bodies that have been Wanton and Sinful, serving Sin, serve the Lord in his Holy Fear; and such humane Learning as hath served Error, may be applyed to Religion, and Gods service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. In the Service and Worship of God our Devices and Inventions must have no place, but carefully and precisely we must ever serve him according to his own pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and Prescription left us in his Holy Word, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 12. &amp; <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 38. and the Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23. delivered nothing but what he received.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. The wood whereof the Ark was made was <hi>Shittim-wood,</hi> a durable and lasting Wood, not subject to Worms and Corruption as other Wood is; so represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the humanity of Christ, whose Body in the Grave felt no Corruption, as other Mens flesh and bodies, neither was subject to sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. The Cherubim was a name of Love and Favour, and therefore his Wings were stretched over the Mercy-seat, to shew us we should be ready to cover the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, especially of the Church, and Church-men; and <hi>Constantine</hi> professed, that should he see a Bishop committing Adultery, he would rather cover it with his own Cloak, then any should be offended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. The Mercy-seat was appointed to be a Covering for the Ark, where the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> lay, and this Mercy-seat was a figure of Christ, who hideth and covereth us from the wrath of God, and from the accusation of the Law: for without Christ <hi>shall no flesh be justified.</hi> Our first Parents having sinn'd, covered themselves with Fig-leaves: and many Christians think to cover themselves with the Fig-leaves of their own Merits; but Christ only is the cover of the Ark when the Law accuseth, to whom whosoever doth fly, and in whom whosoever doth trust, being justified by Faith, they have peace with God through him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. and the Mercy-seat was placed above the Altar, to shew that Gods Mercy is over all his Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. The two Cherubims represented the Two Testaments, and from between these two Cherubims God spake, so doth Christ still by the two Testaments, the Old and the New, the Law and the Gospel, the Prophets and Apostles, and so will he speak
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:36907:59"/>
still to the end. Otherwise we must not now expect: Revelations and Dreams, Visions, and Miracles are ceased; and if they will not hear <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Neither will they believe, though one should rise from the dead and come unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 38. This is a great comfort to Ministers, and to all the faithful people of God, that although my Gifts are not such as to set me high in the Tabernacle, yet am I not therefore utterly unprofitable, or unfit, or rejected of God, but I may be among the meanest vessels of the Sanctuary, and of the Church: if I may be but as the snuffers or snuff-dishes, as a Door-keeper, as a Besom, as an Ash-pan, even this shall please me, and herein will I rejoyce, thanking my God that he hath looked upon me in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; the body hath divers members, and all good, and made by God; the Church hath divers degrees of Believers, and all beloved of God; so if you be one in any place, blessed be God for it, your joy shall be Eternal also and Incomprehensible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 40. From hence you may see the Assistance and the Power that Example hath in Instruction. This was Christs Method in the Gospel, <hi>Quid ab initio, how was it from the beginning,</hi> do as hath been done before. So here it was Gods Method to <hi>Moses</hi> for the Tabernacle, look that thou make every thing after the pattern that was shewed thee in the Mount; and the same was Gods Method for the Creation its self; for though there were no World that was Elder Brother to this World before, yet God in his own Mind and Purpose had produc'd and lodg'd certain <hi>Idea's</hi> and forms, and patterns of every piece of this World, and made them according to those precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Forms and Idea's. Lastly, this was Gods way likewise through the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for there are no Books in the World that do so abound with this Comparative and Exemplary way of Teaching, as the Scriptures do; no Books in which that word of Reference to other things, that <hi>sicut</hi> is so often repeated; do this and do that <hi>sicut</hi> so as you see such and such things in Nature do; and <hi>sicut</hi> so as you find such and such Men in the Stories of Gods Book to have done.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 31. OUr Corruption is the only way to our Incorruption, and our Mortality to our Glory: our Flesh being that Vail that keeps us from entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holiest of Holies. To this purpose (as a Type of this) in the Tabernacle which <hi>Moses</hi> made, there was a Vail hang'd up between the Holy Place, and the Holiest of Holies; this Vail was made up of four substances, blew Silk, and Purple, and Scarlet, and fine Linnen; which saith St. <hi>Ieremy,</hi> did represent the four Elements of which our Flesh consists; such a Vail was afterwards in the Temple at <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> which at the Death of our Saviour was rent from the top to the bottom, so that the People might then, and not till then have beheld the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum:</hi> so when our Flesh, this Vail that keeps us from beholding the Invisibility of the Blessed Trinity, shall be rent and torn in pieces by Death, we then shall behold the glory of that Trinity, and never till then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 37. As in the outward Vail of the Tabernacle there were Sockets of Brass, (as you read in this Verse) and in the inward of Silver; so <hi>God</hi> doth adorn for the most part that which is within. A Man may seem to be as hard as brass, with the outward custom of Sin, yet he may sound with the Confession of Sin like Silver within: and therefore we must have a care how we pass our Censures upon our Brethren; and that we be not like those wild-fire Tongues that do Condemn when they consider the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Fact, and no more, not the Circumstances of the Fact which may lesson it; not the Intention, which might be well propounded, though a Fault in the Action it self; nor the Cause, nor the Evil Company, nor that it was done after a vehement.

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. AS here were divers Instruments belonging to the Altar and the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and all for Use and Employment: so doth the Church of Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of divers Members, and those Members are endowed with several gifts and graces, but all for the Edification of the Church. For wherefore hath this Christian quickness of Wit, that depth of Judgement, this heat of Zeal, that power of Elocution, this man Skil, that Experience, this Authority, that Strength, but that all should be laid together for the raising of the common stock, and put forth for publick advantage. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no true Christian is his own man; so he freely laies out himself according to the measure of his several Gifts and Graces, for the universal benefit of all his fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. How rich therefore is every Christian Soul that is not only furnished with its own Graces, but hath a special Interest in all the excellent Gifts of all the most eminent Servants of God through the whole World. Surely that Man cannot be poor while there is any special Wealth in the Church of God upon Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. The Staves on which the Ark was to be carried, were to be ever ready in the Rings of the Ark upon all occasions of remove. <hi>We have here no continuing Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> saith the Apostle; we have no place of Residence, no fixt Habitation in this Life: and therefore we must be ever prepared to take up these Tabernacles of our Bodies, and be gone. We have but a short time to live, and even that short time is uncertain, and never continues in one stay, but <hi>flies away like a shadow, and is cut down as a flower,</hi> He then that would dye well, must alwayes look for Death, every day knocking at the gates of the Grave, and then the gates of the Grave shall never prevail upon him to do him mischief. This also will help to confine our hopes, and cut short our designs, and fit our endeavours to the small portion of our shorter Life. And as we must not trouble our Enquiry, so neither must we Intricate our Labour with what we shall never Enjoy; we must not dispose of Ten Years to come when we are not Lords of to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor discompose our present duty by long and future designs; such which by cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Labours to Events at distance, make us less to remember our Death standing at the door. But rather let us make use of this instant; for this instant will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again; and yet it may be this instant will secure the fortune of a whole Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

Many men do condemn Gold-smiths, Jewellers, or Lace-Weavers, Perfumers, and such like, as though they served only for Vanity and Excess, when indeed they be the works of God, I mean their several Skils and Fruits of his Spirit, as here we see.

IT was not without some mystery that in the Robes of <hi>Aaron</hi> there was a Crown set upon the Mitre, moralizing a possible conjunction at least of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister and Magistrate in one person. The Crown and the Mitre were together then, but yet the Crown was upon the Mitre; there is a power above the Priest, the Regal power, not above the function of the Priest, but above the person of the Priest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. This shadowed that the Preaching of the Gospel concerning the Blood and Passion of Christ should be publish'd and sounded through the four corners of the World, even over the whole Earth: <hi>and the rest of the Blood thou shalt pour at the foot of the Altar,</hi> noting how the Blood of Christ, though in its self sufficient for all, yet becometh not helpful to all, but is unprofitably poured out for many, as this here was at the foot of the Altar, through their own unbelief, treading under feet that most precious Blood.</p>

That so men might learn to give unto <hi>God</hi> their best service and Duty most thankfully, ever confessing that all fatness, that is, all Comfort, Prosperity, and Joy cometh from him as from the Fountain, and is due to him as his own from all men. But now the very worst is thought good enough for <hi>God,</hi> our worst Corn, our worst Calf, our worst Lamb, and too often neither good nor bad; is this to burn the Fat upon the Altar of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. By the Ear was noted obedience: to signifie that the Priests from whom others should draw Example, should themselves be obedient to <hi>Gods</hi> Word in all things, and first hear, then speak. Obedience was ever acceptable to <hi>God, Psal.</hi> 40. 6. next the Thumb is touched with Blood, to teach that we must not only be Hearers, but Doers of the Word, joyning Works to Faith, and a Holy Life to a sound Belief.

To the like end was the right Toe sprinkled with Blood, that they might so remember to <hi>walk worthy their vocation;</hi> and usually by the Foot in Scripture is both Action and Affection noted. <hi>My feet had almost slipt,</hi> said <hi>David,</hi> meaning both Action and Affection.</p>

THe Altar of Incense was of Wood covered with Gold, figuring so Christ in both his Natures, the Wood his Humanity, the Gold his Divinity; the Deity yielding Glory and Majesty to his Manhood, as the Gold adorn'd and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the <hi>Shittim</hi> Wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. The square form of this Altar represents the firm stability of Christ, who cannot be overthrown. The Crown about it the regal Dignity of Christ, and of all those that are ingrafted to him. For we are Kings and Priesis in him and by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. The sweet Incense notes all Duties and services which the People of God do to him by his appointment, and that they smell sweet before him as the Incense, and are accepted of him: But particularly the Prayers of the faithful, for so <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 14. 2. expounded it. The burning of this Incense upon the Altar, which was a figure of Christ, shadowed out that in Christ and for Christ only our Prayers are in force with God, and therefore by him they ought to be offered unto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. Prayers either made to others, then to God in the name of Christ, or for unlawful things, are strange Incense, and therefore not to be offered unto God. No Saint nor Creature was shadowed by the Altar of Incense but Christ, and therefore let them take heed that will pray to others, and make others present their desires to God.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. To number People in a Land is lawful, and if you think of <hi>David,</hi> why he was plagued for so doing, surely it was not for that he numbred the People, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he did it in a pride and confidence in mans strength.

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. This was a personal Tribute imposed to testifie obedience to God, and therefore equally was paid, to signifie, that God is no respecter of persons, but the poor are as dear to him (doing his Will) as the rich, we are all the Lords, the price of our redemption is one, the precious bloud of that immaculate Lamb Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. In worldly matters the rich may go before us, but in matters belonging unto God, his Worship and Service, we ought to be as forward as the rich. For you see here, that the maintenance of the Ministery was not posted over to Princes and great men only, but even private men also must joyn in this work. For if he be born to inherit Heaven, he must think himself born to maintain the means that lead us unto Heaven. Our Sheep and Cattel we provide for, because they labour for us and feed us, what hearts then should we have to see them comfortably maintain'd that labour for us in a far higher sort, and feed us with a much better food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. We must not meddle with holy things with unwashen hands, that is, with prophane Hearts, Tongues and minds, as they do that read the Scriptures, not to guide their lives, but to maintain table Discourses, drawing the Scriptures to their Judgements, and not framing their Judgements according to the Scriptures. These washings again in the Law had a further reach, being used in Faith even to the inward washing of the Spirit, whereof they were true Sacraments to the Believers So <hi>David, Wash me, O Lord, and I shall be clean,</hi> that is, inwardly, inwardly, O Lord, by thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirit from my sins.</p>

And by this we are taught to use all those Gifts well, whereby we are enabled to discharge our particular Callings; that they may serve for the Glory of God, and the good of his Church: and those that in their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings use fraud and deceit, or else live inordinately; do most unthankfully abuse the Gifts of God, and dishonour the Spirit of God the Author of their Gifts.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. God here joyneth <hi>Aholiab</hi> with <hi>Bezaliel</hi> in the work of the Tabernacle, that by this means it might be the more compleat. If there should be any fault in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaliels</hi> work <hi>Aholiab</hi> might mend it, and if there should chance to be any error in <hi>Aholiabs</hi> performance <hi>Bezaliel</hi> might correct it; that so by the care and circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of these two able Workmen nothing might be omitted. And as it was thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, so was it under the Gospel; the Work of Christs Church, as well as <hi>Moses</hi> Tabernacle, must be performed by pairs. Therefore Christ sent out his Apostles to preach the Gospel by couples, two and two together. <hi>Two are better than one,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon.</hi> For first, if they fall, the one will lift up the other, that which is stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger shoreth up the weaker. One man may be an Angel to another, in regard of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and assistance, nay a God to another, as <hi>Moses</hi> was to <hi>Aaron.</hi> Secondly, if two lie together then they have heat, heat of Zeal and good Affection. When <hi>Silas</hi> came <hi>Paul</hi> burnt in spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. warm he was before, but now all of a light fire as it were. The Enemy is readiest to assault when none is by to assist, and much of our strength is lost in the losse of a faithful Friend.</p>

O The ingratitude of that giddy multitude, a man would have thought they would have wept out theit eyes, and sighed their hearts in sunder for such a man as <hi>Moses,</hi> such an Instrument of God and Good to them, such a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, so famous a Governour, so dear to God, so familiar with God, and so graced and honoured by God: And yet how contemptuously they speak of him, when they say, this <hi>Moses,</hi> this <hi>Moses.</hi> And therefore by this example let all wise Ministers never rely upon the multitude but upon the Author of their Calling, joy in their obedience to him, rest upon his gracious acceptance, and leave the world to be a World full of unthankfulness to all degrees of well Deservers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 3. Aaron</hi> demanded their golden Ear-rings, thinking they would not have given them. For in the East Countries such Ear-rings were Ornaments, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Women. But he was deceived; so pleasing to our corruption is Idolatry and Superstition, that we spare no cost to set that forward. And indeed their Idol was their Jewel.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. Those Sacrifices were such as God had appointed, but now diverted from their use, and therefore nothing lesse than pleasing unto God. Which shews, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we use the same words in our Prayers, and do the same things that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture appointeth, if they differ from right, as these Sacrifices did here, we pull down Gods Wrath upon us instead of his Blessing.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. The Lord cals them <hi>Moses</hi> People, whereas they were the Lords People, and by his mighty Arm delivered, not by <hi>Moses</hi> his strength. Thus doth the Lord ascribe to his Ministers what his Power worketh by them, that so they may be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in their pains, and the People know to love them, hearing God himself say, that they be their People.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. This shews the incomprehensible loving kindness of God towards such as truly fear and serve him, making them in his Goodness so powerful with him, that they are to him (as it were) bands to tie him, and avail against him, that he cannot exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his anger against Offendors, unless they will suffer him, and as it were, stand out of the way. Thus in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. when <hi>Sodom</hi> was to be destroyed, said God, for so many, and so many, I will not do it. Thus also <hi>Ezek. 22. 30. I sought for a man,</hi> &amp;c. as if God had said, might I have found but one to stand in the gap against my wrath, even for that one I would have shewn Mercy. Let this therefore comfort you, that if for other mens sins a true <hi>Moses</hi> be such a stop to God, that he will not punish them, think then, what force have your own sighs and groans for your own sins before him? Can he strike you holding up your hands for Mercy, and looking upon him with warry eyes, humbled in the dust before him, and for his dearest Sons sake, in whom he is well pleas'd, begging pardon.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. Who knows what Judgements godly Governors turn away by their earnest Prayers to God for their People. Which should work in us all Love, and Obedience, and Duty to them, and make us day and night pray for the continuance of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. In matters concerning Gods Glory we must rebuke our nearest Allies, no place for Affection. The Lord hath placed the Commandements in the Decalogue, and the Petitions in the Lords Prayer, which concern his Honour, before those which concern our selves, to teach us, that we ought to prefer his Glory before all worldly things, yea even life it self if it come in question, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 37. Thus did <hi>Moses</hi> also, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. prefer Gods Glory, which would appear in saving of his People, before his own salvation, which is far more than this temporal life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 31. Moses</hi> doubleth in this Chapter the foulness of their fault, calling it a great <hi>Sin,</hi> and a greivous sin; so teaching us not to extenuate faults before God if you sue for Mercy, but to set them out in their true colours, that Mercy may the more appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 34. Magistrates and Ministers may not desist from their Duties for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples frowardness, but indevouring to the uttermost to reform them, they must go on though they perish, and even in their so perishing they shall be a sweet Savour to the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 35. Very greivous is the sin of Idolatry, that not for <hi>Moses</hi> his so earnest Prayer may be freed wholly from all further punishment, though in part the Lord yieldeth as he did, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. A Sound and upright heart with God will ever in the end procure honour, however for a time contempt may be shewed, for God will honour them that honour him, it is his Word, and it shall never fail. Would God then, men would be moved to seek honour this way by the Favour of God and not of men. For God can make men rise up to you, that have formerly little regarded you, as here he did to <hi>Moses,</hi> the People now (that he was in favour with God) reverenc'd him, whom before they spake very lightly of, saying, <hi>This Moses, we know not what is become of him.</hi>

                  <hi>Verse 13. Moses</hi> desires of God, that he would shew him his Wayes, his Dealings, his Proceedings with Men, that which he cals after his Glory, how he glorifies himself
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:36907:62"/>
upon Man; God promiseth in the next verse, that he will shew him all his Goodness: God hath no way towards Man but Goodness, God glorifies himself in nothing upon Man but in his own Goodness. And therefore when God comes to the performance of this Promise in the next Chapter, he shews him his Way, and his Glory, and his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in shewing him that he is a merciful God, a gracious God, a long suffering God: And (as the Hebrew Doctors note) there are thirteen Attributes specified in that place, and of all these thirteen there is but one that tastes of Judgement (that <hi>he will punish the sins of the Fathers upon the Children)</hi> all the other twelve are meerly Mercy. Such a proportion hath his Mercy above his Justice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. When God had promised <hi>Moses,</hi> in this Chapter, to send an Angel to shew the People their way, <hi>Moses</hi> said to God, <hi>See, thou sayest lead this people forth, but thou hast not shewed me whom thou wilt send with me.</hi> God had told him of an Angel, but that satisfied not <hi>Moses,</hi> he must have something shew'd to him, he must see his Guide, and therefore, said <hi>Moses,</hi> wilt thou be pleas'd to shew me thy Glory? Shall we see any thing? Now they did see that Pillar in which God was, and that Presence that Pillar shewed the way. To us the Church is that Pillar, in that God shews us our way. For strength it is a Pillar, and a Pillar for firmness and fixation. But yet the Church is neither an equal Pillar, alwayes fire, but sometimes Cloud too: The Church is more or lesse visible, sometimes glorious, sometimes eclips'd; neither is it so fix'd a Pillar as that it may not admit changes in some places; fix'd indeed in respect of Fundamentals, but yet a moveable Pillar for things indifferent and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. GOds Ministers by preaching and crying unto men, may, as it were, hew their stony hearts, that is, prepare them for writing, but only the Lord must write in them by the finger of his blessed Spirit, and no man can make any thing enter without him, <hi>Paul may plant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but God giveth the encrease.</hi> Secondly, as God did not write before the stones were hewed, so no more assure your self will he ever in your heart set any good if you contemn the outward hewing and preparing of you by the Word in the Ministery of his Servants. Thirdly, by the former Tables broken, and these new made, some have thought to be figured the abrogation of the Law, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of the Gospel, our old corruption, which must be broken, and our new Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, which must come in place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. The greater manifestation of God and his Truth is vouchsafed unto us, the more ought we to humble our selves and be thankful, worshiping that God which so mercifully dealeth with us. Again, when God gives signes of his presence let us make hast to him, and not suffer him to passe away while we are hindred with this and that. God gives signes of his Presence in the Word preach'd, in the Sacrament, in my heart by good Motions: O let him not passe away; but make hast, as <hi>Moses</hi> here did, bow down and worship,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. God in the former verse had promised to be gracious, and in this <hi>Moses</hi> fals to prayer: to shew us, that the Promises of God kindle Prayer. Wherefore use (when you are dull to pray) to meditate upon the Promises of God, general, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, so many, so sweet, so full of power to enflame a heart half dead, and when you feel the fire kindle, then pray; it will flame out at last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13 It is you in the singular; to signifie, that publick things were to be done by publick persons, the Altars here were to be pull'd down by <hi>Moses.</hi> But for private matters private men may do them, as <hi>Iacob</hi> purg'd his own House of his Wives Idols. Private men to meddle with publick matters is dangerous. <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Athens</hi> and found an Altar, yet he threw it not down. Therefore beware of false Spirits, that will

rashly write of Reformation without tarrying for the Magistrate. So every man may be a Magistrate, and the sweet society of man with man turn'd to bloud and slaughter. Some yet are too mild, and they tell us Idolatry must be first taken out of the heart by true teaching. 'Tis true, teaching must go before, but what then? is therefore the Magistrates work excluded? No: For are not the sins also of the second Table to be taken out of the heart by teaching? and yet I hope the Magistrate may concurre with teaching, and punish Theives and Murtherers. Much more then in the first Table touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods Honour and Service.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 29. Modest men are not carried away with knowledge of their own gifts, but are, as it were, ignorant of them. In matters of Almes the Lord saith, <hi>Let not your right hand know what your left hand doth.</hi>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 30. To note first, that Ministers Faces, that is, their outward actions and words, which appear to men, should glister and shine, <hi>So let your light shine, that men may see your goodworks.</hi> Secondly, to shadow, that the Law which <hi>Moses</hi> now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented is only bright and shining in the Face, a meer outward Justification before men, whereas the Righteousness of Christ is all glorious within and without. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to teach, that the Law lightneth the Conscience, which is as the Face of the inward man, making it see and know sin, but it lightneth not the Mind by Faith to save from sin, Christ only doth this by his Spirit: Therefore saith the next verse, <hi>the people fear'd and durst not approach:</hi> The Law ever striking a terror into the hearts of them that behold their sins in it and by it. Such a Fear there is in Guiltiness, such Confidence in Innocency. When the Soul is once clear'd from sin it shall run to that Glory with Joy, the least glimpse whereof now appales it, and sends it away in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>

Nihil in lege gloriosum, habet Moses praeter solam faciem.</hi> His hands were leprous by putting them into his bosome, his feet also had no glory, he being bid to put off his shooes, and so by that Ceremony was to deliver the Spouse unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But in the Gospel he appeared in the Mount with Christ, <hi>totus glorificatus,</hi> this sheweth the preheminence of the Gospel before the Law. The Latine reads, <hi>&amp; facies ejus erat cornuta,</hi> but this is for the mistake of our Hebrew word <hi>Keren,</hi> an Horn, for <hi>Karan,</hi> to shine, <hi>Tostatus</hi> sayes the meaning of the Latine is, <hi>emittebat radios sicut cornua.</hi> This also shews the righteousness of the Law, only a shining of the Face, that is, of the external Works before men. The Vail over <hi>Moses</hi> signifies the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that when <hi>Moses</hi> is read they understand not the end of the Law.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. IF God had not been Friends with <hi>Israel</hi> he had not renewed his Law. As the <hi>Israelites</hi> were wilfully blind if they did not see Gods anger in the Tables broken: So could they not but hold it a good sign of Grace, that God gave them his Testimonies. There was nothing wherein <hi>Israel</hi> out-stripped the rest of the World more than in this Priviledge, the pledge of his Covenant the Law written with Gods own hand. Oh what a Favour then is it where God bestows his Gospel upon any Nation. That was but a killing Letter, this is the Power of God to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Never is God throughly displeased with any People where that continues. For like as those which purposed love, when they fall off, call for their tokens back again; so when God begins once perfectly to mislike, the first thing he withdraws is his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. It is a very great blessing to have an importunate Conscience to stirre us up in all good Duties. Such a Conscience regards not what pleaseth us, but what is good for us, that it looketh too, and that it perswadeth too, and that it urgeth. This blessing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:36907:63"/>
had these willing <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Text, who gave freely to the building of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. Observe here, their Heart, that is, their Conscience stirr'd them up: ye have Bracelets, ye have Rings, offer them, sayes Conscience, to further this pious Work in hand: their Spirit made them willing; their faithful Friend in their bosome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science overcame them with Arguments and strong perswasions. This then must needs be a great Blessing, to have such a faithful Conscience; it will make a man part with all his Lusts, Pride, Self-love, Covetousness, carnal Delights, for Gods Glory, and our own true Good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. When God was once reconciled to his People in the Wilderness, after their sin in setting up the golden Calf, in the thirty second Chapter of this Book, to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their great joy and thankfulness, they brought stuffe more than enough to the building of the Tabernacle. Even the Women brought their Bracelets, and Ear-rings, and Tablets; glad they had any thing of price to dedicate to God, and to seal up their thankfulness for this re-admittance into his Love and Favour. The new Converts, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. lost fifty thousand pieces of Silver in the burning of their Books to gain Christ; all their curious Arts and Authors were not to be valued with one verse of the Gospel. <hi>Matthew</hi> at his Conversion made a Feast like a King for Christ: Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when once he became a Proselyte, built a Synagogue; thinking it a happy purchase to gain eternal Habitations by a temporal Mansion.</p>

No man might come uncalled to the King of <hi>Persia</hi> upon pain of death. What then shall we think of such as come without a Call to the King of Heaven. Christ would not let the Devil preach him, <hi>Mark 1. Quia extra vocationem,</hi> (as one well noteth) because he had no calling to such an Office. Ministers are Embassadors, and it is Treason to enter upon an Embassie before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by our Prince. And therefore to be a mans own ordainer (as <hi>Basils</hi> word is) to clap down into <hi>Moses</hi> Chair upon a vain Enthusiasme, is prophane presumption, and uot to undertake our Office but invade it; being so esteem'd by God, as may appear by that fearful Irony to the false Prophets, <hi>I sent them not, yet they run;</hi> run, knowing nor why nor whither; like <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> in <hi>Samuel;</hi> and at length, like him, they can tell no tidings.</p>

What large Endowments were bestowed upon the Church by our devout and liberal Predecessors; insomuch that Laws were fain to restrain the bounty of those Contributions: But now the Church may cry with the Prophet, <hi>my leanness, my lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> What a shame this is amongst Christians, that Sacriledge should croud in with Religion: Why should our better knowledge find us lesse conscionable. O injurious Zeal of those men, that think the Church cannot be holy enough unlesse she beg. It was said of old, that <hi>Religion bred Wealth, and the Daughter eat up the Mother.</hi> I know-not, if the Daughter devour'd the Mother, I am sure the men of these times would devour both Daughter and Mother. When <hi>Moses</hi> built the Tabernacle, we read here, he was fain to with-hold the People from giving, they were so forward; but

THe Ark was a Chest or Cabinet, wherein the Tables of the Law, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant betwixt God and his People was kept; and just so big every way this Ark as was the Mercy-seat, verse 6. to shew, that Gods Covenant is answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Mercy, and his Mercy to his Covenant. Get therefore into Covenant with thy God, and endeavour to keep that Covenant, and then thou mayst rest sure of his Mercy, and his Gaace, but neither of these belong to those that are without the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: For as the Mercy-seat was no larger than the Ark, so neither is the Grace of God than the Covenant. And as the Ark and Mercy-seat were never asunder, so God is near to all that call upon him in Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. This Merey-seat in the Hebrew signifies a covering, or coffering up of our sins; the appeasing of an angry God by Christ, who is our Propitiation or Mercy-seat, according to <hi>Rom. 3. 25. We are justified by Iesus Christ, whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation for our sins, through faith in his bloud;</hi> that is, to cover and coffer up our sins, in allusion to this Text and the ninth verse; where the Ark covering the two Tables within it, and the Mercy-seat covering the Ark, and the Cherubims cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mercy-seat and one another, shewed Christ covering the Curses of the Law; in whom is the ground of all Mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. These Cherubims here were to represent the holy Angels attending upon God, waiting his Commands, and looking intentively into the Mystery of Christ, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that part of the Mystery which concerns our Redemption; as the Cherubims did here into the Mercy-seat. And they are said to be made out of the matter of the Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, to shew, that the very Angels have their establishment in and by Christ: So that if they need Mercy how much more do we? If their faces are continually bent upon a Saviour, how can we look off? 'Tis true, the Angels were not redeemed by Christ; but yet they are under Christ as a head of Government, of Influence, of Confirmation, though not of Redemption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. This represents the consent of the Old and New Testament, in both which there is but one Truth, and one Doctrine; the Old having his face towards the New, and the New also looking towards the Old. For what is the Old Testament but the New obscure? And what is the New Testament but the Old made plain? And both the Old and New look upon Christ, who is the true Mercy-seat, the Seat of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; they being saved in the Old Testament by believing Christ should come, and we being saved in the New by believing he is come.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. VVHile the Church of God was in a journeying condition, a small Altar and a slender Sacrifice were sufficient; but in <hi>Solomons</hi> time the Altar was four times as big as this here, and the Sacrifice was multiplied. God looks upon the condition of his Servants, and will be content with what they are able to perform. When the Church is in persecution, a Grot or Cave of the Earth may passe with God for a Temple, and a Turfe of the same Earth for an Altar, and Gods Presence in such holes shall be as eminent, as in the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> when that Temple was in its greatest Glory. But when God shall please to restore his Church to Peace and Plenty, then God doth expect that our returns of Duty should be answerable to such Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings; that as our Peace and Prosperity is more than it was, so should our service and Worship of God exceed in a due proportion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. A good Prince doth the Office which <hi>Moses</hi> his Glasses did at the brasen Sea in the Temple. For he shews others their spots, and in a pious and unspotted life of his own shews his Subjects their deficiencies. And to make an higher use of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> his Glasse than to see a King in; the whole Creation is that Glasse, wherein we may see the King of Kings, even our God himself. Scarce can you imagine a vainer thing (except you will except the vain lookers on in that Action) than the Looking-glasses of Women, and yet <hi>Moses</hi> brought those Looking-glasses to a religious use, to shew them that came in the spots of dirt, which they had taken by the way, that they might wash themselves clean before they passed any further. There is not so poor a Creature but may be thy Glasse to see thy God in. The greatest flat Glasse that can be made, cannot represent any thing greater than it is. If every Gnat that flies were an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel, all that could but tell me, that there is a God, and the poorest Worm that creeps tels me that. If I should ask the Basilisk, how camest thou by those killing Eyes, he would tell me, thy God made me so; and if I should ask the slow worm, how camest thou to be without Eyes? he would tell me, thy God made me so. The Cedar is no better a Glasse to see God in than the Hysop on the Wall. All things that are, are equally removed from being nothing, and whatsoever hath any being is by that very Being a Glasse, in which we see God, who is the Root and the Fountain of all Being.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. The work of the Tabernacle was perform'd, not according to the Will and pleasure of Man, but God; not as <hi>Bezaliel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab</hi> thought fit, though they were knowing Men, and great Artizans, nor yet as <hi>Moses</hi> would have it, but sayes the Text, <hi>as the Lord commanded Moses.</hi> In matters of concernment about Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Worship, who so fit to command and prescribe as God. Men are but Men, and therefore may erre. The holy Patriarchs in the Old Testament were holy Men, yet they strayed into some sinful Actions; the holy Fathers in the Primitive Church were holy Men, yet they strayed into some erroneous Opinions: and therefore neither the one nor the other can be an infallible Warrant for us. If God command <hi>Moses, Moses</hi> may command us. Neither Temple, nor Sacrifice, nor Priest are of our own contriving, any invention of Man, but prescribed and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God himself.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. IN all which rowes we may observe these seven things. First, the shining of the stones, pointing to the Purity of Christ and his Church. Secondly, their price of great value and worth, signifying, at what price Christ valued his Church at. Thirdly, their place or situation; they are set in the Pectoral, and <hi>Aaron</hi> must carry them on his Heart, signifying, that Christ hath as much care of his Church, as if it were inclosed in his Heart; lets out his Bloud to make room in his Heart for them. Fourthly, their number twelve, implying, that with Christ is plentiful Redemption. Fifthly, their order, they stood in a comely Quadrangle: Christ hath stablished a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Order in his Church, and we must keep our ranks. Sixthly, the Figure being four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>square, signifying, the stability and firmness of the Church: Satan and all Deceivers shall not pick one stone out of Christs Pectoral. Lastly, the quantity; as all the Names of <hi>Israel</hi> were gathered into a narrow compass; so Christ shall gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one all the dispersed Sons of God, and present them before God, as the most beautiful and pretious parts of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 23. The care that was here taken to preserve the Ephod that it should not rent, serves to teach us our Duty, and that we are to use all circumspection and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to keep Schisms and Divisions out of the Church. For to break the Unity of the Church, is to divide, to cut asunder the very Veins and Sinews of the mystical Body of Christ. And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth conjure his <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 10. by the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that <hi>they speak one and the samething, and that they be perfectly joyn'd together, in one mind and in one judgement.</hi> I or Schisms do disjoynt Men, they shake them out of their Senses, and fright them out of their Wits. <hi>Beware therefore,</hi> sayes the same Apostle, <hi>of the Concision, Phil.</hi> 3. 2. that is, of those that make Divisions, and cut the Church into little pieces, and sucking Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. Christs Coat was seamless, and his Dove but one. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Primitive Christians were famous for their unity: As the Curtains of the Tabernacle were joyn'd together by Loops, so were they by Love; and as the stones of the Temple they were so close cemented together, that they seem'd to be all but one stone, to have all but one mind and one soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 26. It is the Duty of Ministers to live their own Sermons, to be fruitful as well as painful Preachers, and to teach as well by their Life as Doctrine. Not like him, of whom it was said, that when he was out of the Pulpit, it was pitty he should ever go into it, and when he was in the Pulpit, it was pitty he should ever come out of it. Every good Ministers six dayes should be a Commentary on the seventh, and his own life in the week dayes should be the use of that Doctrine he delivers upon the Lords day.

And this is to have the Priests Garment fring'd about with a Bell and a Pomegranate: to shew they must be neither dumb Dogs, nor stinking Weeds; but lead the People as well with the sweet scent and savour of their Actions, as the sound of their Words.</p>

                  <hi>Verse 13. MOses</hi> that is appointed here to annoint and consecrate others was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver annointed and consecrated himself; that so we might learn not to value external Sacraments or Signs by the Dignity of the Minister, but by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. Again, that the invisible Grace is of force without the visible sign when God will have it so, as in <hi>Moses</hi> here: but then withal we must know, that this was an extraordinary Command of God to <hi>Moses,</hi> who was then Gods Vicegerent, or Vicar-general, and therefore what he did God did. And certainly God, who is the Author of all order, may prescribe the form and manner of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. Observe how often from this to the two and thirtieth verse is repeated <hi>as the Lord commanded Moses,</hi> and see how sweet commanded Obedience is. Were it as acceptable to God to be served with inventions, never would these repetitions be made. Beware therefore of these wayes: and in very reason conclude, that if you expect from your Servant your Commands to be fulfill'd according to your will, much more may God expect the same obedience from you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 32. Those that dispense Gods Ordinances, that wait upon his Altar, must come with clean hands and a pure heart. Holiness becomes every man well, but best of all publick persons; and that not only for example of good, but liberty of control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ill. The Snuffers of the Sanctuary made to purge others must be of pure Gold themselves, and the Priest that is to purifie and cleanse the Congregation, must be first washed himself.

Secondly, that it is not enough to believe, that Christ was to die for sin, but he must lay his hand upon Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> lay upon him all his iniquities by the hand of his Faith, apply Christ to himself, and believe that he died for his sins, my sins, your sins, being the only Propitiation for sin. Thirdly, this laying on the hand shewed, that men bringing Sacrifices to God, should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sacrifice their exorbitant affections than those Beasts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. The reason why God tyed them to a place, and not suffered them to sacrifice where they pleased, was, that by this means they might be kept from using any unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:36907:67"/>
manner in their Sacrifices, which they might have done if in every place at their pleasure they might have Sacrificed. The same reason is now for our set publick pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods Worship, where the people are to perform their Duties to God after one manner, not allowed at their will every one to have a several place, lest private places should breed private Fancies, Errors, and Heresies in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. This was to teach the Party that offered the Sacrifice to offer up himself to the Lord flayed and without skin, that is, without all counterfeit and hypocritical shews, without all earthly, vain, and proud Confidence in himself, or any Works or Worth whatsoever in him, but naked and bare, to present himself to his God with a single and faithful heart, boasting of no Desert, but humbly craving Mercy and Pardon for Christs sake the true Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. This was a great comfort to the poorer sort of Offerers; for thus are they assured, that although they were not of ability to Offer unto him Oxen and Sheep, yet were they as dear to him as those that could so do, and their Sacrifice of Pigeons or Turtles yeelded as sweet a savour. And thus gracious will God ever be; even two Mites of a poor Widdow shall be accepted, and a little Spice, or Goats-hair, or what my power is to bring unto him shall be received. For it is not the Gift, but the Heart of the Giver that God looks upon and respects; and thus the poor Widdows Mite could weigh but little very little with God, but the Heart weigh'd heavy; and so her Heart being put to her Mite, gave it weight above the greater (but far more heartless) largesses of the Pharisees.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. THis Offering thus parted and sprinkled with Oyl, signified the Graces of Gods Spirit, where with Christ was fully annointed within and without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his fellows. For they were only singly annointed, either as Kings, or as Priests, or as Prophets: but Christ was a thrice Sacred annointed Person; a Prophet to teach us by his Word, a Priest to purge us by his Blood, a King to guide us by his Spirit. And this three-fold Office of our Saviour was really represented by the Oyl wherewith he was annointed; For first, Oyl is said in the <hi>Psalms</hi> to make <hi>a chearful countenance,</hi> and thus doth Christ as a Prophet make not only a cheerful Countenance, but a cheerful Heart and Soul by Preaching the glad Tydings of Salvation. Secondly, Oyl doth supple and cure Wounds, and so doth Christ as a Priest the Wounds of our Souls and Consciences with that precious Ointment of his Blood. Thirdly, Oyl will still be the uppermost of all Liquors; so likewise Christ as a King, is above Men and Angels, hath the Soveraignty over all the Creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. By this Rule of having no Leaven, they were taught the purity of Christs Doctrine, and the Holiness of his Life; his Doctrine so pure, that it maketh others pure, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 3. and his Life so pure, that not only his false Accusers could fasten no fault upon him, but by his Innocency, he appeased Gods Wrath for our Impurity. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it taught the Church that after Christs Example they ought to be free from both these, to wit, false Doctrine, and ill manners; not Teaching if they be Teachers any corrupt Matter, nor believing and holding if they be no Teachers any absurd Untruths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. Salt was required in the Sacrifice to figure out Christ, who indeed is the true Salt, that seasoneth us and all our Works, or else neither we nor they please <hi>God.</hi> Sin hath made us unsavory to <hi>God,</hi> and till this Salt be sprinkled over us, we have no access to him, nor savour with him. And further, by Salt here we may understand Mortification, and holy discretion, or sincerity of Doctrine and Discipline, whereby the Saints are seasoned and preserved from the putrefaction of Sin and Error; and being preserved themselves, they preserve others. For as Salt keepeth Flesh from putrifying,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:36907:67"/>
so do the Saints of the World; and are therefore sprinkled up and down (here one and there one) to keep the rest from stinking.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. THE Fat that was upon the Inwards was offered, and yet the Inwards themselves, in particular the Heart was not offered. For the Heart &amp; Brain were never Offered in Sacrifice, because they are the Fountains and secret Arks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lurks all Iniquity. And yet though the Heart be not given, yet hearty Thanks must be given to God, such as cometh not from the Roof of the Mouth, but the Root of the Heart, the most inward part and bottom of our Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. Some have judg'd the pleasures of the Flesh to be here shadowed, which of a true Child of <hi>God</hi> are to be kill'd and slain as Sacrifices were, and mortified. Others looking at the phrase of Scripture, which usually noteth by the word Fat the best things, have thought that herein was figured how Men ought to offer unto God ever of their best, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 12. &amp; <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 16. but now in the Tithes and Duties do you give the best? do you offer the Fat? He that lives licentiously all his Youth, and intends to offer unto God his Old Age, when for debility of Body he can do no more harm, doth he offer unto God the Fat or the Lean, the Best or the Worst? Lastly, because this Fat that was to be offered was an Inward thing, and not an Outward; others have thought that thereby was figured how careful we must ever be to offer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God our Inwards, without which no External Duty can or will please <hi>God.</hi> The Lord saith <hi>David, Loveth truth in the inward parts, and his Sacrifice is a troubled spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a broken and a contrite heart within,</hi> not a pale face, a down look, many outward sighs that are heard of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. The Lords prohibition of Fat did teach them to use a modest, moderate, and fitting Diet; Blood also was forbidden them, that so they might learn to take heed of cruelty, and to shew mercy and loving-kindness in all their Actions and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours. <hi>Gods</hi> People must neither be Carnal nor Cruel; but their Souls must shew mercy as their Heavenly Father is merciful, and their Delight must be not inluxurious, and high-feeding Dishes, but in the Marrow, and Fatness, and Sweetness of <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinances.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. WHen you read that the High Priest had need sometimes to offer for his Negligences and Ignorances; you see how plainly it was taught to that People that the High Priest was not the true High Priest, which should make perfect satisfaction unto <hi>God,</hi> but another was to be expected, even Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. By this sevenfold sprinkling, the grievousness of sin is noted, according to that in <hi>Genesis,</hi> he that slayeth <hi>Cain</hi> shall be punished seven-fold, that is grievously. Wherefore this seven times sprinkling of the Blood shews, that every sin with <hi>God</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth seven punishments, that is sharp and great punishment, if <hi>God</hi> should deal with us in Justice, and not in Mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. The Blood was put on the Horns of the Altar of sweet Incense, to signifie that no Prayer can peirce unto <hi>God,</hi> but in and by the Blood of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. The whole Bullock was to be burnt, being a sin-offering; to teach men to burn all their sins, and not to divide them; as we do when we say I will amend my
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:36907:68"/>
Drunkenness, but I cannot leave my Swearing; but we must all our sins, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keep none, lest but one being wilfully still delighted in, burn us wholly in Hell for ever. When <hi>Moses</hi> with the <hi>Israelites</hi> was to depart out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would have had them leave their Cattle behind them, saving what they intended to Sacrifice; answer was made, they would not leave one hoof of a Beast behind, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 26. and so deal you with your Sins, leave not one hoof of Sin behind, no one sin, no part of a Sin, that is, by wittingly, willingly, and boldly continuing in it, otherwise free from Sin in this Life we cannot be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. A multitude of Offenders excuseth no offence, but if even the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation should sin through Ignorance, yet a Sin-Offering must be offered by them all, and their number yeeldeth no excuse. Secondly, In this phrase <hi>hid from the Eyes,</hi> you may see the state of many a Man and Woman doing evill. The matter is hid from their Eyes in Gods anger, and all-be-it they lye at the Pits brink of Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Destruction, yet they see it not, feel it not, are not troubled with it: because indeed they never sit and take an account of themselves and their Works. The godly do this at last, and therefore in the next Verse there is a time of Knowing to them as there was of hiding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. The Priest here used a seven-fold sprinkling of Blood upon the Altar, and we observe a seven-fold shedding of Blood in Christ: in his Circumcision, in his Agony, in his fulfilling of the Prophesie, <hi>Isai. 50. 6. I gave my cheeks to them that pluck'd off the hair,</hi> and in his Scourging, in his Crowning, and in his Nailing, and lastly in the piercing of his side; these seven Channels hath the Blood of thy Saviour found. Pour out the Blood of thy Soul; Sacrifice thy stubborn and Rebellious Will seven times too; seven times, that is every day of the week, and seven times every day, for so often a Just man falleth; and then how low must that Man lye at last, if he fall so often, and never rise upon any fall; and therefore raise thy self as often, and as soon as thou fallest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 27. In all Sacrifices where Blood was to be offered, the Fat was to be offered too. If thou wilt Sacrifice the Blood of thy Soul, Sacrifice the Fat too. If thou give over thy purpose of continuing in sin, give over the memory of it, and give over all that thou possessest unjustly and hast corruptly got by that sin, else thou keepest the Fat from God, though thou give him the Blood.</p>

Upon our Garments we endure no manner of Uncleanness, not a little Mote but we brush and beat it off. Yet our Bodies and Souls are unclean, and we see it not, we go not about to see it, but use all the means we can to put it out of our sight by sports, Company, and the like.

Oil signifying gladness, and Incense a sweet savour; The Lord by this Ceremony shadowed how hateful a thing it is, and all that commit it, till the Lord be reconciled to them again: He hath no joy in us, neither yield we any sweet savour. And as he joyeth not in us, so should not we joy in our selves. For if we do, we pour Oil into our Sacrifice contrary to the Law, and we think our smell is as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to God, pleasing and acceptable, when he abhorres us and all our Works. The Lord loveth a sorrowful sinner adorned with sackcloth and ashes, and they that so weep shall laugh.</p>

How little this false and unjust dealing with Gods Ministers is regarded with many in these dayes, who knoweth not, and they are never troubled for it, much lesse do they purpose either restitution or amendment.

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. The Priest must ever make the Atonement, so ever signifying, that not in the Sacrifice but in the Priesthood was the matter. Now in that Priesthood was typifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christs Office. And therefore as then no Sacrifice pleas'd but as offered by the Priest, so at this day nothing of ours, as Prayer and the like, availeth, but in Christ and by Christ our only and eternal High-Priest. Again, the Text sayes, Before the Lord the Atonement shall be, thereby overthrowing the wicked error of them that affirm a civil purgation only of sin by those Sacrifices, and not any spiritual Promise in them. Because so those Sacrifices should no wayes have served to breed and strengthen Faith in Man touching his spiritual Estate, whereunto indeed they wholly aimed.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. This Fire which God first kindled, was not to be as some momentary Bone-fire, or a sudden and short Triumph, nor as a domestical Fire, to go out with the day, but it was given for a perpetuity, it must neither die nor be quench'd; God as he is himself eternal, so he loves permanency and constancy of Grace in us: If we be but a flash and away God regards us not; all Promises are to perseverance. Sure it is but an elementary Fire that goes out, that which is Celestial continues. It was but some presumptuous heat in us, that decayes upon every occasion. But yet he that miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously sent down this Fire at first will not renew the Miracle every day by a like supply: It began immediately from God, it must be nourished by means. Fuel must maintain that Fire that came from Heaven, God will not work Miracles every day: If he have kindled his Spirit in us, we may not expect he shall every day begin again; we have the Fuel of the Word and Sacraments, Prayers and Meditations, which must keep it in for ever. It is from God that these helps can nourish his Graces in us; like as every flame of our material Fire hath a concourse of Providence; but we may not expect new infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: rather know that God expects of us an improvement of those habitual Graces we have received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. First, by this he figured the death of Christ from the beginning of the World, and by this shadow they were led to believe, that although as yet Christ was not come in the Flesh, nevertheless the fruit of his Death belonged to them, as well as to those that should live when he came, or was come: for this Fire was continual, and went not out, no more did the fruit of his Passion fail to any true Believer, even from the beginning, but they were saved by believing that he should come, as we are now by
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:36907:69"/>
believing that he is come. Secondly, this shews that God is ever ready to accept our Sacrifices, ever ready to hear us and forgive us, but we are slow and dull, and come not to him as we ought. Thirdly, no other Fire might be used but this, and so they were taught to keep to Gods Ordinances, and to fly from all inventions of their own heads. Lastly, this fire thus kept with all care taught them, and still may teach us, to be careful to keep in the Fire of Gods holy Spirit, that it never die nor go out within us. The Fire is kept in with wood, with breath, or blowing, and with ashes; so is Gods Spirit kept in by an honest Life, as by wood, by true sighs of unfained Repentance, as by Breath or blowing, and by meek Humility, as by soft ashes.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. VVHy God should think of so small and base a thing as the skin, some may ask the reason. And it is first to confirm our Faith in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that he will never forget us, and leave us destitute of things needful and good for us, seeing we are much better than the skin of a brute Beast, whereof yet he hath care and thought. Secondly, this shews that sweet and comfortable care that the Lord then had, and still hath of the Ministery, that it should not be defrauded of the least thing allotted to it. And therefore harden not your heart against God, against Law, against Right and Truth; accustome not your hearts to cover your Neighbours due, your hands to purloin it by fraud, or take it by strength; it is theft, spiritual theft, sacriledge, your house receiveth stoln Goods, and the Wrath of God may happily shake the foundation of it for such a sin, and you in yours, or you and yours be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. Here Leaven is admitted of, which before was forbid: Leaven therefore is taken in a good sense as well as in an ill. Thus the Apostles are resembled to a little Leaven that leaveneth the whole lump, they being sent out of God into the unleaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed World, by preaching to leaven it clean through. And there is a Leaven of the new Nature accepted, as there is a Leaven of the old Nature rejected. For look how the Leaven maketh the Bread savory, and strong, and wholsome, look also how it makes it rise and heave up, which otherwise would be sad and heavy; So doth Gods regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Spirit change us, make us savory, and all our Duties pleasing to God; and we rise up, our Hearts and Souls are heaved up in all love, in thankfulness to him that in Mercy hath so look'd upon us.</p>

For God loveth not idle banquetting and prodigal spending, although he allow graciously what is fit for the occasion. Secondly, this was done in wisdome by God, least if the flesh should have smelt by longer keeping, Religion might so have been vile in the eyes of fickle persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. We may learn by this, that the taking hold of Christ is not to be deferr'd and put off, but speedily and quickly to be done, whilst time serves, and opportunity is offer'd. For <hi>behold,</hi> sayes Christ, <hi>to day, and to morrow, I cast out Devils, and the third day, Luke</hi> 13. that is, a short time I have yet to go on with my Ministery, and then I shall be slain. More particularly every Man and Woman may be said to have three dayes. The first of Youth till Age come, the second of Age till Death come, and in these two dayes there is Mercy offered, but the third day is after Death, and then there is no help; as here on the third day no Offering was accepted, but the sin remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned, and not forgiven.</p>

IN that <hi>Aaron</hi> was here commanded to offer as well for himself as the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he was herein a figure of Christ, not that Christ had any sins of his own, but that ours were so laid upon him, and he so made satisfaction to God for them as they had been his own. <hi>Surely,</hi> sayes the Prophet, <hi>Isai. 53. 4. he hath born our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> &amp;c. that is, we judg'd him evil, as though he were punish'd for his own sins, and not for ours.</p>

That God which shew'd himself to Men in fire when he delivered his Law, would have men present their Sacrifices to him in fire: and this fire he would have his own, that there might be a just circulation in this Creature: as the Water sends up those vapours which it receives down again in Rain. Hereupon it was that fire came down from God to the Altar; that as the charge of the Sacrifice was delivered in fire, so God might signifie the acceptation of it in the like fashion wherein it was commanded. The <hi>Baalites</hi> might lay ready their Bullock upon the Wood; but they might sooner fetch the blood out of their Bodies, and destroy themselves, than one flash out of Heaven to consume the Sacrifice.</p>

If thus <hi>Aaron</hi> in so great a Judgement, how much more we when our Friends dye naturally, sweetly, and comfortably: so that we may boldly say we have not lost them, but sent them before us, whether we hope also to follow.</p>

It was an unusual sight for <hi>Israel</hi> to set a linnen Ephod upon the Beer; the Judgement was so much the more remarkable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had the badg of their Calling upon their backs. Nothing is either more pleasing unto God, more commodious to Men, then that when he hath executed Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it should be seen and wondered at; for therefore he strikes some that he may warn all.</p>

They again may be called clean, dividing the Hoof, who do not believe in great or in gross, but discern and distinguish things; as Christ and <hi>Moses,</hi> Nature and Grace, not believing every Spirit, but trying the Spirits <hi>whether they be of God or no.

There is no sin in Marriage if it be not abused, but because this is rare, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after Women were delivered, God appointed them to be purified, shewing that some stain or other doth creep into this Action, which had need to be repented; and therefore when they prayed, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 5.)

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 45. So careful was God to have unclean persons known and discern'd from others in those dayes. And we may take occasion also to wish that with us also in these dayes all bold and presumptuous mis-livers being most unclean before God and all good Men, were distinguished from them that hate their wickedness by some such open marks as these were, to the end that others might avoid them, and they themselves be stricken with some shame to amendment of Life, and saving of their Souls. Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally these things in the Leper shadowed the state and condition of all wicked men in this World. As the rent Cloaths, that they are vile and odious before God; his bare head, that in Christ their head they have no Portion, but are deprived of him; his Lips or Mouth covered, that such graceless persons cannot open their Mouth before God in any Prayer to be heard; his shutting out of the Camp, that such are to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate from the number of the Faithful, and are deprived of the Heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</p>

Before thou condemn thy Brother, put thy hand into thine own bosom, as <hi>Moses</hi> did, and tell me if it be not leaprous with that sin which thou condemnest in thy Brother: and therefore Cause the Priest should not give rash Judgement, the Leaprous was shut up seven dayes. We must not be hasty to condemn others: nay youmay reason further with your self thus; that if in a matter thus subject to the Eye, as these Sores were yet God would have no haste, but a stay for seven dayes before Judgement should be given that the Party was unclean; O how more doth he abhor hast in pronouncing of the Hearts and Thoughts of our Friends and Neighbours, which are not seen nor subject to an easie Censure.

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. THe Law of the Leper here was, that he should be brought unto the Priest, men come not willingly to this manifestation of themselves, nor yet are they to be brought in chains, by a necessity of an exact enumeration of all their sins; but to be led with that sweetness, with which the Church proceeds in appointing sick persons, if they feel their Consciences troubled with any weighty matter, to make a special confession, and to receive absolution at the hands of the Priest: and then to be remembred, that every coming to the Communion is as serious a thing as our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration out of this World, and that we should do as much here for the settling of our Conscience, as upon our Death-bed</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. That it is still the duty of all Faithful Ministers to go to the sick to see them and consider their estate towards God, ministring comfort to them in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whilst their hearing is good, their understanding good, and their memory good. And I would God, that they that are sick had more care to send for their Ministers in due time, and the Ministers, when they know it, to go, and with all care and diligence to labour with them while time serves.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. By the two Sparrows, sayes <hi>Theodoret,</hi> the cleansed person was put in mind to offer unto God both Soul and Body a living Sacrifice. The Sparrow slain might teach him the necessity of Mortification in the Body, which indeed is an earthen vessel, the killing of it over pure Water, that nothing more worketh this Mortification than the pure Water of Gods Word contained in the Scriptures; and that by the bloud of Christ we are truly cleansed and set at liberty, as here the live Sparrow dipped in the bloud of the slain Sparrow is set free.</p>

This sevenfold sprinkling might happily shadow an earnest and tontinued meditation of Gods Goodness to him that thus was comforted, and not for a day or two and then no more. Surely our thoughts of Mercy vouchsafed to us are ever too short and transitory, and therefore seven sprinklings are little enough to teach us our duty herein. God of his Mercy so sprinkle us over and over, that we may ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his kind Goodness towards us a thousand wayes.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. OUr Nature, whether running or stopp'd, is unclean: We have uncleanness, corruption in us, though it doth not shew it self, and this is Original Sin, call'd here our uncleanness, and by Saint <hi>Paul, Rom. 7. Sinful sin;</hi> so evil in its self, that it could not have a worse Epithete given it than its own name: call'd also by the same Apostle in the same Chapter, <hi>The body of death,</hi> a dead body or carcass, to which we are tied; as noisome every whit to our soul, as a dead body to our senses; and as burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some as a withered arme or mortified limb, which hangs on a man as a lump of lead. Now some remnants of sin God hath left in us, to clear to us his justifying Grace by Christs Righteousness: And this also will make the Saints seem nothing in their own eyes, even when they are fill'd brim full with Grace and Glory in another World.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. So contagious a thing is sin, that it defileth the very visible Heaven and Earth; which therefore must be purged at the last day with a Deluge of Fire, because they were not made clean by a Deluge of Water; as here the earthen Pot which was but touch'd by an unclean person was broken, and the wooden Vessel scour'd and rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in water. How therefore ought we to fly from sin, when even the touch of an unclean person defileth a man? And if the Garment spotted with the flesh be so contagious, how mortal must the life and conversation of such a man needs be to the Soul.</p>

When you read thus often of Water, cleave not to the Element or Creature of Water, but remember Saint <hi>Iohn, 1 Iohn</hi> 5. 6. tels you, that Jesus Christ came by Water and Bloud; and it is he only that washeth away our spots, and saveth us from our sins; and by the offering of the Turtles it was plainly figured, that not in themselves, but in some others they must be made clean from all their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. IN that <hi>Aaron</hi> was forbidden at all times to enter into the Holiest of Holies, we may learn, that even Ministers as well as other men are not rashly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into all the things of God, but to stand in reverence of some Mysteries, either deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not at all, or very advisedly and sparingly with them, as their nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. When we appear before God, we must come with a Sin-offering, that is, come with an humble acknowledgement, as this Sin-offering figured, that thou art a sinner, confessing it to God with a greived heart, and bring Jesus Christ in thy soul with thee, offering him by thy true Faith to God his Father, as a sure safety for all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners against deserved wrath and punishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. We must be cloth'd with Christs Righteousness, as with this holy linnen Coat, if we ever find acceptance with God. For to that end <hi>Aaron</hi> did change his Garment, to shew, that he sustained another person who was holy, he himself being but a man subject to imperfection and sin. Now if <hi>Aaron</hi> might not enter but in such sort, how much lesse might the People appear at any time before God, but in Christ, and by Christ, shadowed in all these Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. When confession was made over the Head of the Scape-goat, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of words were used, as all iniquities, all trespasses, all sins. Why so many words? but to teach, that confession of sins must not be light and formal only, but earnest, vehement, hearty, and zealous. And indeed never can a Child of God satisfie himself herein, but still wisheth he could more bewail his sins, and more earnestly expresse with words what his Soul feeleth in this behalf; saying, as I heard a dying woman once say, O Sir, I am sorry, and sorry, that I can be no more sorry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 31. God would name his Sabbath according to the nature of it; and Sabbath is rest. It is a rest of two kinds, our rest, and Gods rest. Our rest is the cessation from labour on those dayes, Gods rest is our sanctifying of the day. For so in the religious sacrifice of <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 8. when he was come out of the Ark, God is said to have smelt, <hi>odorem quietis,</hi> the savour of rest. Upon those dayes we rest from serving the World, and God rests in our serving of him.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. THe Reasons of the severity of this Law were: first, because it served for the preservation of the Ministry which God had ordained, and that every Man should not be his own Priest. Secondly, Because thus they were taught, that all Worship of God ought to be guided and directed by his Word and Commandement, and not by the private wills of Men. And if you say that <hi>Samuel</hi> offered in <hi>Mizpeh, 1 Sam.</hi> 7. and <hi>Elias</hi> in <hi>Mount Carmel, 1 King.</hi> 18. and so neither brought the Sacrifice to the door of the Tabernacle; you must answer your self thus, that all this in these Men was extraordinary, and we may not follow extraordinary matters without some such personal and special Vocation, as no doubt they had; for we do not live by Examples, but by Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. The burning and broiling of Beasts, and the sprinkling of their Blood upon the Altar, could of themselves yield no sweet savour; but thereto was added Wine, Oyl, and Incense by Gods appointment; our Prayers as from us would never please; but as Indited by the Spirit, and presented by Christ, they are highly accepted in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Christ is the Incense, the perfume of all our Sacrifices: and therefore if ever we intend that our Sacrifice, either of Praise, or Prayers, should carry a sweet savour along with it, it must be offered up in and by Christ: for he is Gods <hi>Benjamin,</hi> the Son of his Love, in whom alone God is well pleased. Upon which account it is, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church doth evermore conclude her Prayers with this Expression, <hi>Through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>

The Lord by this Law would teach Men to abstain from Murther, and Blood-shed, the Blood of Man being <hi>Vehiculum animae vitalis;</hi> for the Vital Spirits which yield unto Man through his whole Body heat, motion, and action, are begotten of Blood by the power of the Heart, and therefore Mans life, and the life of every other Creature is said to be in the Blood, according to that of the Poet, <hi>Purpuream vomit ille animam.</hi> Secondly, Because the Lord had ordained Blood to be used in the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made for Sins, as a plain figure of the Blood of Christ the only able Sacrifice to purge and wash away our Sins and Offences, therefore he would have Blood regarded as an holy thing, and not used by Man as other Meats might be.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. THis Expression, <hi>I am the Lord your God,</hi> is often repeated to draw at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and beget Authority. For consider, first it is thy Lord, thy Master that speaks; he whose House is the World, and all the Creatures his Servants, shall we not then listen when this our great Master shall speak. Secondly, it is thy God that speaks, the Eternal Creator of Heaven and Earth; he who hath made all, preserves all, and can as easily destroy all again; he who is the All-seeing God, that looks upon thee in thy privare Closet, in thy bolted Chamber, under thy drawn Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; that sees all thy secret villanies, and stoln Embraces, all thy wicked Plots and Contrivings; and shall we not then hear and fear him? What running and striving would there be who should come first, if a King, or some great Lord should call. O let not the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings call so oft, and thou sleight and neglect it; but rather say with <hi>Samuel, Speak Lord, for thy servant heareth;</hi> speak Lord to my Ears that they may hear, speak to my Memory that it may retain, speak to my Heart and Affections that they may be obedient, speak to my Life and Conversation that it may be answerable to thy Word; then shall thy servant hear aright, and not before.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. If any Man think of some Marriages of holy Men in Scripture, contrary to these Rules, let him remember that we now live by Laws, and not by Examples. What God then either approved or tolerated, let us neither rashly condemn, nor unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly follow, but obediently tarry within the Precincts of the Law of Nature. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in these Cases let it ever be remembred, as good reason it should, not only what is lawful, but what also is convenient and fit to be done. For many things are lawful which are no way yet expedient, but most unfit in regard of some Circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. Every notorious sin committed by any of Gods people, is a prophanation of his Name, that is, it causeth the Name of God to be prophaned and blasphemed by others, to stink among the ungodly. Those that make a profession of Religion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Gods Name no way so much, as by consulting and shaming their profession by a scandalous Conversation, such as becomes not the Gospel of Christ. Good men count sin to be the greatest smart in sin, as being more sensible of the wound they therein give the glory of God, than of any personal punishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 25. From this Verse to the end of the Chapter may be seen the penalty of breaking these Laws of a pure God, as in the beginning you see the profit of keeping them. Learn then, that not forraign Foes only may bring a Land to Desolation and Destruction, but much sooner and soarer these home-bred Impurities; which if a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Magistrate, Master, or Father keep down, they procure the safety of the Land or house, more than if they resisted Violence with Arms. To <hi>vomit out her Inhabitants, and to spew out her people,</hi> are terms of great vehemency with God; and therefore most great should Mans fear be lest he should provoke him to such vengeance.</p>

But when God commanded something to be left in the Field for them, his meaning was not that they should have nothing out of the Barn; but the Lord willed here precisely somewhat to be left in the Field, because he knew our Corruption, which more hardly parteth with a thing already housed, and brought in, then when it is yet abroad in the Field. And therefore to meet with this hardness, and to provide the better for them, he commandeth a care in the Field before it come in, and yet expecteth the other too as need requires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. The Law against Stealing hath an Explanation here added, <hi>Neither deal falsely, nor lye one to another:</hi> as if he should have said, mistake not the matter of Stealing, neither judge better of your selves than there is cause; but know it ever for a truth, that although you break no Houses, nor rob upon the way, yet if you deal falsely one with the other in buying and selling, or any way; and lye one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by affirming it cost so or so, or by denying any thing committed to your credit and custody, assure your self you are a Thief, and guilty of the Eight Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Though a New Opinion may seem a poor Opinion, able to do little harm, though it may seem a pious and profitable Opinion, and of good use, yet if it stand in Judgement, and pretend to be an Article of Faith, thou shalt not spare it, thou shalt not countenance this Opinion upon any Collateral Respects, but bring it to the only tryal of Doctrines, the Scriptures. And as for Opinions, so likewise for Sins, thou shalt not pitty the Poor in Judgement; when thou callest thy self to Judgement, and thy Conscience to an Examination, thou shalt not pitty any sin, because it pretends to be a poor sin, either poor so as it cannot much endanger thee, not much incumber thee, or poor so as that it threatens thee with Poverty, with Disability to support thy State, or maintain thy Family, if thou entertain it not. Many times I have seen a Suitor that comes in <hi>Forma pauperis</hi> more trouble a Court, and more importune a Judge than greater Causes, or greater Persons; and so may such Sins as come in <hi>Forma pauperis</hi> either way.</p>

And although some one or other infirmity may justly disable thee for such a place, either in Church or Common-wealth, yet from a place with the Elect, either here or for ever, it shall not hinder thee; No nor ten thousand blemishes, if thou art grieved for them, and fighting against them, dost take hold of thy spotless Saviour, as thy help and safety against them all.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. NOne but those that were clean might eat of the holy Things; nay those that did but enter into the Tabernacle being unclean, were threatned with death by God. Now what should this solemn preparation under the Type put us in mind of, but the true and inward preparation required still of us in the Anti-type; that is, to teach us, that we ought carefully to sanctifie, prepare and purifie not our clothes and external parts, but our hearts from all sin and impurity, before we presume to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach into the presence of God, either to eat of Christ our spiritual Passover, or to hear and receive his most holy Word. And certainly the neglect hereof is the very cause why that Sacrament, which is to some the Bread of Life, is to others the Bread of Condemnation; and that Word of God, which is to some the Saviour of Life unto Life, is to others the Saviour of Death unto Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. A good Work without the heart is but a glorious sin: for not so much the things themselves as the affections of men are considered of God. One may have a free mind in poverty, and a sparing mind in riches; so it is not the Work but the Mind. Thus the Lord regards not so much the thing done, as the heart and mind of him that did it. If we build only on the Work, we have no better evidence to shew for our salvation then the Devils and Reprobates. Not the Work then, but the Heart is that that will stand and go for currant: to shew this the Lord would have a free-will Offering among all the rest of his Sacrifices; hereby shewing, that the heart must be joyn'd with obedience; nay so much did the Lord regard the Heart, that he would not admit of any Gift for the building of the Temple, but what came from a free will.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. IN that they were called the Feasts of the Lord, men are taught in them to seek and attend such things as belonged to God, and not their own business, pleasures and sports. And in the fourth verse they are called <hi>holy Convocations;</hi> think therefore in your Conscience whether gadding and rioting be holy exercises, and meet for an holy Convocation. To this end they are still call'd in the Christian Church Holy dayes, to put us in mind of the right use of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 3. It is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings.</hi> Wherefore saith St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> learn that no place priviledgeth thee to break Gods Law: but as being a sinner, whithersoever thou goest thou carriest the yoak of sin; so being the servant of God in all places obey his Will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. O marvellous accordance betwixt the two Testaments! in the very time of their delivery there is the same agreement which is in their substance. The ancient <hi>Iews</hi> kept our Feasts, and we still keep theirs. The Feast of the Passover is the time of Christs Resurrection, then did he passe from under the bondage of Death. Christ is our Passover, the spotless Lamb, whereof not a bone must be broken. And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the very day wherein God came down in Fire and Thunder to deliver the Law, even the same day came also the Holy Ghost down upon the Disciples in fiery Tongues for the propagation of the Gospel. The promulgation of the Law makes way for the Law of the Gospel: No man receives the Holy Ghost but he that hath felt the terrors of <hi>Sinai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. This being but one single sheaf that God demanded, it might strike their hearts with a pious sense of his Goodness, that giveth so much and taketh so little,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:36907:75"/>
that giveth without measure, and taketh by measure, yea by a very small measure. So let it still profit us to this day: for even now also we receive much and give little, would we give that little thankfully and chearfully, what a comfort would God take in it? Though he need none of our Goods, only seeking to exercise our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. This shaking of the sheaf before the Lord taught them to acknowledge, that the blessing of new Corn every year cometh neither from the fertility of the ground, nor the labour and industry of man, but from the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. This Feast having its time assigned, they could not enter upon their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest before it was full ready; which by this time it would be, unless they would either reap before they offered this first sheaf, or offer it before the day appointed. And so you see it had an use to restrain ill Husbands, and to make them more careful that old Corn might be kept till new came. A gracious God that will so care for sinful Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 24. Some think that this Feast was instituted for a remembrance of the pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that grievous Idolatry committed by erecting and worshipping the Golden Calf; others, that they might learn holy Assemblies to be appointed by the voice of God; and if they then when they heard these Trumpets blow might think God called for them to the meeting, why should not we now, having our Bells for their Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, think God calleth for us to the Assemblies of the Faithful, when we hear them ring in our Ears. Surely I know a feeling heart doth, and therefore cannot be quiet without going. And upon this account this Feast might be a figure; shewing how Christ by the preaching of the Gospel, as by a loud Trumpet, should be spread over the World, and our Salvation by him. In regard whereof the Prophets bids the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters <hi>lift up their voices like Trumpets, Isai.</hi> 58. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 34. The use of this Feast was to remember the Jews of their Estate when they had no Houses, but lived in Tents, or Tabernacles and Booths; as also to preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the Doctrine afterward delivered by the Apostle, <hi>That here we have no abiding City,</hi> but should reckon of our Honses as of Tabernacles for a time. And might we not heretofore remember upon our Feasts our state past under cruelty &amp; bondage, our wars and Dissentions in this Land, the fall of our Friends, and the change of many Houses, our Imposions and Taxes, and in a word, very many Miseries and Calamities; laying them to those then present times, wherein we enjoyed Truth and Liberty of Conscience without either death or danger; what a change was this to a Man that knoweth and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the blessing. Let us therefore do what we ought to do, and what the Jews did, thank God most heartily for the change, and beseech him to restore us such times, that in peace we may live, in peace dye, and in peace that never endeth live with him for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 37. These Feasts you may see were in remembrance for the most part of some benefits and mercies of God; and therefore plainly teach us what a due duty from us to God it is to remember carefully and thankfully his loving favours shewed to us at any time upon any occasion. Thus the stones were commanded to be set up by <hi>Ioshua</hi> 4. 6, 7. for a sign to the Jews, <hi>that when their Children should ask their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

IN these times of Shadows and Figures those Lights signified, that while they were thus used, the true Light was not yet come, by which all true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers should be delivered from the darkness of Death. And further, this Light was a figure also of true Doctrine, which ever must shine in the Church of God. The Oyl Olive which they are commanded to bring, must be pure likewise, to shew, that that Doctrine must have no mixture of Mans devices, but be pure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. Though the Father of this Offender was a stranger, an Egyptian, yet God would not spare him; how much less then his own people, I mean Christians by Father and Mother, Baptized in his Faith, brought up in his fear, hearers of his Word, and Professors of it. Secondly, Though this Man committed this fault in his anger, yet God spared him not; how then do we excuse our Offences by our Anger, saying it was in my wrath I said so, or did so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. This Blaspheming was Cursing the other by the Name of God; such as our fearful and Damnable Phrases are, <hi>Gods Curse light on thee, the Plague of God take thee;</hi> which kind of Speaking is not only a breach of the Second Table concerning the love to our Neighbour, but a breach also of the First Table, by taking Gods most Holy Name in vain; and then to use God in your Revenge, and to make him a party, or an Executioner of your Rage, wishing that he may Curse and Plague where you will, (he being all Mercy, all Goodness, all Justice,) O what an encrease of your sin is this!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. This grievous Offender is not winked at by them that heard him, neither yet punished by them that had no Authority, out of a colour of Zeal; but he is order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and by a right Zeal carried to <hi>Moses</hi> the Magistrate, and his offence opened there. <hi>Moses</hi> again, (although such a man) yet will do nothing hastily in Judgement, and especially touching Life, but he will be advised by God, and in the mean time commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him to Ward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. By this Ceremony of putting their hands upon his Head, the Lord made the Witnesses careful what they said; for it taught them, that if they bare false Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, then were they guilty of the Blood of him so shed: but if they spake truly, then as he that offered a Sacrifice by laying his Hand upon the head of it, did cast his sins upon the Beast; so they by that Ceremony laid his Blood upon his own head, and they remained clear and blameless; yea the whole Congregation by such Execution of Justice is cleansed. So that when <hi>Phineas</hi> had slain the wicked Person, it is said he turned the wrath of God from the Land, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. and the killing of the wicked is called <hi>Victima Dei, the sacrifice of God, Isai. 34. Ier.</hi> 46.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. When the Lord will have the whole Congregation to stone him, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth tryal of the zeal of all, and teacheth all to concur with the Magistrate in love and liking of Justice, and in furthering of it so far as belongeth to every mans place. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now a dayes we have such Factious and corrupt humors in us, out of which issue out such dislikes, and bad censures of Magistrates as grieve them, hinder Justice, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to that which will smart if he be not the more merciful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. This restrained that pride which otherwise might have been in the Jews, and shews the common care of God for all men as well as for the Jews. This indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency is a blessed vertue to be learn'd from our God. For surely we are altogether partial if God guide us not. Thus if other Mens Children, Servants, or Friends hurt ours, fire and sword for them; but if ours hurt them, no such matter: all must be boulstered out, or bought out, or born out, and Justice may not be done. Again, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our own, one Child must be Crucified, and another not touch'd; one made a Saint, another a Devil.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. THis resting of the Land every seventh year, put them in remembrance of that sin which cast out all out of Paradice, and brought men to labour, and the Earth to need it. Whereas if we had stood, the Earth should have yeilded of its self Fruits and Profits, as in some sort they might see by the seventh year. Again, it shadowed out the true Sabbath and rest in Heaven, where shall be no labour, and yet no lack, but all comforts and joyes imaginable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. Upon which blowing it had the Name of <hi>Iubilee, (Iubilaeus a Iobel quod significat buccinam.)</hi> This year was an excellent figure of that true <hi>Iubilee</hi> and freedom which was confer'd upon us by Christ. For this Jewish Jubilee was proclaimed by Trumpet; so is the Christian freedom by the Trumpet of Preaching the Gospel. In that Jubilee no debts were demanded, and such things as grew of themselves were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; so in the Christian Jubilee is freedom proclaim'd by Christ, Sathan hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to demand what by sin we ow him, either Soul or Body, and all the graces of God which grow of themselves, <hi>i. e.</hi> are freely bestowed upon us, are common in Christ to all, there being with him no respect of persons, but all accepted <hi>that fear him, and work righteousness.</hi> Of this freedom speaks, <hi>Isai.</hi> 61. 1. Thirdly, in that Jubilee of the Jews there was a returning to their Lands which were alienated from them; so by this Christian Jubilee we return to our old Paradice again from whence we were cast out by sin, even that Paradice of Heaven, from which we shall never be removed any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. In this verse the Lord meets with an objection of some men that might happily say, what shall we eat the seventh year; and answers, <hi>I will send my blessing upon you in the sixt year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.</hi> Let this verse then strengthen your Faith against all objections of Flesh and Blood made from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reasons. For if God be able, even then when the earth is weakest, having been worn out with continual tillage five years together, to make the sixt year bring forth a triple blessing; what unseasonable weather? what barrenness of Land? what any thing shall make a man despair of Gods providence for things needful? Again, can God be thus strong when the Land is weak? why then cannot he be, or why will he not be strong in my weakness, in your weakness, and in every mans weakness, that trusts and leans upon him. For when we are weakest, then is he strongest, and his power is best seen in our weakness. Away then fear and diffidence, I will trust in him, drawing an Argument with <hi>David</hi> from my weakness to move him to strengthen me, <hi>Heal me O Lord, for I am weak, Psalm</hi> 6. 2. My weakness shall drive me to thee, not from thee, and I will tarry thy good leisure; Lord strengthen me, Lord comfort me in all Temptations and afflictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 43. Let us take notice from this custome of the Jews concerning Servants, that although <hi>Moses</hi> his Law in these particulars hath his end for form, yet the equity still bindeth in these things, and the estate of servants under the Gospel brought and bought out of spiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> and bondage of sin by Christ, may not be worse than it was under the Law, when you see they might not be cruelly ruled and dealt with. To this end the Apostles Exhortation tendeth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 9.</p>

                  <hi>Verse 5. CAlamities</hi> that last long are light, and if they be heavy, they are short; both wayes there is some intimation of some ease. But God suffers not this impenitent sinner to enjoy that ease, God will lay enough upon his Body to kill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in a week, and yet he shall pant many years under it. As the way of his Blessing is here, <hi>Your vintage shall reach to your threshing, and your threshing to your sowing;</hi> so in an Impenitent sinner his Fever shall reach to a Frenzy, and his Frenzy to a Consumption, his Consumption to a Penury, and his Penury to a wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tyring out of all that are about him, and all the sins of his Youth shall meet in the anguish of his body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. Behold, what need we care whether we go while we carry the God of Heaven with us? he is with us as our Companion, as our Guide, as our Guest. No impotency of Person, no cross of Estate, no distance of Place, no opposition of Men, no gates of Hell can separate him from us: he hath said it, <hi>I will not leave nor forsake thee;</hi> shall we think he cannot fare ill that hath mony in his purse; and shall we think he can miscarry that hath God in his heart. How shall not all comfort, all happiness accompany that God, whose presence is the cause of all blessedness. He shall counsel us in our Doubts, direct us in our Resolutions, dispose of us in our Estates, prosper us in our Lives, and in our Deaths Crown us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. God does not begin with a <hi>Morte moriendum, some body must dye,</hi> and therefore I will make some body to kill, but God came with a <hi>Morte morieris,</hi> yet thou art alive, and maist live, but if thou wilt rebel thou must dye. So here God did not call up Fevers, and Pestilence, and Consumptions, and Fire, and Famine, and War, and then make Man that he might throw him into their mouths; but when man threw down himself, God let him fall into their mouths. Had I never sinn'd in wantonness, I should never have had Consumption; nor Fever, if I had not sinn'd in riot; nor Death if I had not transgress'd against the Lord of Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 44. Some are of an opinion that these words were fulfill'd in the Captivity and Deliverance out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But the Jews perswade themselves that this promise of regard, when they should be in the Land of their Enemies, is not yet accomplish'd. But whether so or not, we may very well apply this promise to a true penitent sinner, who shall ever be respected upon his Conversion; albeit he neglected the time of Grace offered. Yet this is no imboldning to presume, but a comfort when Repentance is true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 45. The wayes of Gods delivering penitent sinners are divers, and to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that we err not. For some upon their sorrow God not only receiveth to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and mercy, but also delivereth them out of their present affliction. So did he <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses</hi> the King, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. whose sin upon his Repentance he not only forgave, but released him out of captivity, and brought him into his Kingdom again. Others he receiveth into favour, and forgiveth their sin, but yet suffereth to fall by their outward affliction. So did he to the penitent Thief upon the Cross, he received him into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, but saved him not from the Temporal Death. The due remembrance of this is a great comfort against the loss of Friends in Wars, and Plagues, and the like calamities, when others escape and do well. Let us therefore cleave fast unto God, believe his Mercy, fear his Justice. So whatsoever happeneth unto us shall happen for our good one way or other.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. IT is in thy power to vow or not to vow; but having vowed a thing law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and possible, it is not in thy power (though never so poor) to dispense with thy Vow: Indulged thou maist be, but not Exempted. If thou hast vowed rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that rashness must be repented of; but the vow, if lawful, must be perform'd without delay or diminution to the utmost of our power. 'Tis true, we are no where in Scripture expresly commanded to Vow, but having vow'd, we are expresly commanded to keep that Vow. That of <hi>David, Vow, and perform to the Lord,</hi> is not a pure precept saith one, but like that other, <hi>Be angry and sin not,</hi> where Anger is not commanded, but limited: so neither are we simply commanded to Vow, but having voluntarily vowed, we may not defer to pay it to our power, be we never so poor; Delaies are taken for Denials, Excuses for Refusals. And therefore every upright conscientious votary, as he looks that Gods promises should be made good to him, so he is careful to make good what he hath Vowed to God: and this because Gods Covenant is of Mercy, ours of Obedience; and if we expect that God should be All-sufficient to us, we must be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether faithful to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 28. From this and other Texts, which shew what large provision was made for Gods Priests under the Law, we may note; that if such a plentiful maintenance were allowed by God to his Ministers of the First Table, then certainly as great a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the least doth belong to the Ministers of the Second Table. For it is certain, that as we under the Gospel are more bound unto the Lord in all Duties of Thankfulness since the <hi>Messias</hi> exhibited, than they under the Law to whom he was only promised; and as in the same respect the Ministry of the Gospel far excels the Priesthood of the Law: so the portion which is due from us to God, and from him to his Ministers, ought to be answerable, at least little inferior.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 33. There can no one instance be given out of the Word of God, either that Gods people payed, or that God accepted for the Tenth, some other thing, money, or money worth, less in value than the Tenth; and when our Saviour, speaking of the Pharisees which Tith'd their Mint, Annis, Cummin, said, <hi>This they ought not to have left undone;</hi> he signifies not obscurely that the manner of Tithing in Kind, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diminution even for those smaller things much more, for the greater was in use untill his time, and was a manner of Tithing just and lawful. And how precise God was in this point, we may not obscurely gather by this, that he prohibited any man so much as to change the Tith, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good, without a penal augmentation of it.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. As this Book of <hi>Moses</hi> beareth the Title of <hi>Numbers;</hi> so a great part of it is spent in numbring of the People; to assure us that God hath numbred those that are his, he keepeth the taile of them, and none are hidden from him, none escape his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and sight. From whence we learn, that the Lord knoweth perfectly who they are that are his, both what their numbers, and what their Names are. Are we then in trouble and persecution? are we accounted silly Men, obscure, base, and unregarded? do we live as contemptible persons to the men of this World; let not this trouble or grieve us, dismay, or discomfort us; but rather let us lift up our heads, assuring our selves that although men turn themselves from us, yet God looketh upon us, and though they seek to root out our Names from the Earth, yet he will know us, and call us by our Names.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. It is required of all Gods Servants to perform obedience to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; when ever God speaks unto us, we must hear and obey his voice. <hi>Noah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Commandement from God to build the Ark; many hindrances might have staid him, and sundry inconveniences might have stopt him, and infinite dangers might have terrified him from that enterprize; as the greatness of the Ark, the labour of the building, the Taunts of the Wicked, and an hundred of such like troubles might stand in his way, yet <hi>Noah</hi> over-looked them all. <hi>By Faith Noah being wrrn'd of God, moved with reverence prepared the Ark, Heb.</hi> 11. 7. which shews that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever God hath a mouth to open, and a Tongue to speak, we must have an Ear to hear, and a Heart to obey whatsoever is enjoyn'd us.</p>

God had promised to <hi>Iacob,</hi> that he would make him a great Nation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. and here it was performed. All the promises of God are Yea and Amen, and shall in our time be accomplished to his Children.</p>

Every Tribe had his certain Captain and Leader design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God who is the God of order: and therefore giveth to his People Rulers to fight their Battles, and to guide them in order and Godliness.

Reuben</hi> was the Eldest Son of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and to him as the First-born the Birth-right did belong; and yet we see <hi>verse</hi> 3. that <hi>Iudah</hi> was placed before him; thus doth God sometimes shew himself a just Judge in punishing sin, and yet withall, a merciful Father to <hi>Reuben</hi> in his Posterity: for whereas he had deserved to be raced out of the number of <hi>Gods</hi> people, because of his Incest: yet <hi>God</hi> allowed <hi>Reuben</hi> here the second place among the Tribes: So that all-be-it he was punish'd justly, he was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish't gently.

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. THere is a Natural Generation, and there is a Moral or spiritual Generation, my Father begets me the first way, and my God or my Teacher the second way. Thus here <hi>Moses</hi> did Regenerate what <hi>Aaron</hi> had begot, he was a Father by his directions and instruction, when <hi>Aaron</hi> was only by Nature. The word delivered by Gods Minister, for our spiritual Birth and Education is not a dead letter, an empty sound as some would have it: for together with the Word there goes forth a Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating power, the exhortations thereof are operative means of Sanctification; as when God said, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> or Christ said, <hi>Lazarus come forth.</hi> The Spirit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the seed of the Word profitable and generative. And hence Ministers are call'd Fathers; as <hi>Moses</hi> here was Father to <hi>Aarons</hi> Children, who are therefore call'd <hi>his Generation.</hi>

It was the sign of Gods acceptation in consuming the Beast; but whiles it destroyed Men the fearful sign of his displeasure. By the same means God can bewray both love and hatred. And here one might have thought, that being but young Men, and not yet warm in their Function, both Age and Inexperience might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd them: but no pretences can bear off a sin with God. That no man may hope the plea either of Birth, or Youth, or of the first Commission of Evill, may challenge pardon; I see here young Men, Sons of the Ruler of <hi>Israel,</hi> for the first offence struck dead.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. The First-born are said to be Gods by several Rights. First, by right of Redemption: he that is saved is not his own, but his that saved him; <hi>He hath saved us from our enemies, that we might serve him, Luke</hi> 1. 74. Christ hath therefore broke the Devils yoke from off our Necks, that we might take upon us his yoke that is easie, and his burthen that is light; serve we must still, but after another manner, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did when freed from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, <hi>Yet thou shalt keep this service,</hi> saith <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 12. 25. Secondly, the first-born are Gods by right of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, as usually best beloved, that together with our Children he might draw to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the best of our affections. Thirdly, by right of Sanctification, they were saparated they were sanctified to the Lord to wait on his Altar; to shew that singular things are expected of all that draw nigh unto God in any duty, but especially in the office of the Ministry. Those that stand in the presence of Princes, must be exact in their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. God appointed both the weights and measures of the Sanctuary to be twice as

large as those of the Common-Wealth; which implies that he expects much more from those that serve him there, than he doth from others.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. A Type of Christ who is light Essential, and <hi>giveth light to every man that cometh into the world,</hi> to every man the light of Reason; to his own a supernatural light to know Heavenly things; an affecting transforming Light, which shall change us into the same Image with himself from glory to glory; as the Pearl by the often beating of the Sun-beams upon it becomes Radiant; which will make us walk as the children of Light, like so many Christal glasses, with a light in the midst of each, which appeareth throw every part of them; and in respect of this light, every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted understanding in its highest abilities is at the most (but as <hi>Aeschilus</hi> saith of Fire stoln by <hi>Prometheus,)</hi> a beam of that Light Essential.</p>

                  <hi>Verse 19. Aaron</hi> and his Sons must appoint the <hi>Cohathites</hi> their several Offices, and shew them what part every particular person must bear; that the wrath of God do not break in among them: and this consideration of the wrath of God ready to come upon offenders, ought to encrease their care to do the duty that God requires. Holy things must be handled Reverently, Religiously. Whatever matters of God we med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle withall, whether it be Hearing of his Word, or Receiving of the Sacrament, or Calling on his Name, we are to be careful to do them with all possible Care and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Hence it is that Christ willeth us to <hi>be careful; not only what we hear, Mark</hi> 4. but also <hi>how we hear, Luke</hi> 8. 18. We must regard not only the matter that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, but the manner how it is received; for as much as we may hear the Word, and yet sin in our hearing. Whensoever therefore we have to do in any part of Gods Worship, let us come in Humility and Lowliness, let us approach near him with a broken Heart, with a Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Verse 22. Moses</hi> in this and the following Verses repeateth sundry points set down in the former Chapter; to teach us that it is lawful for Ministers to make repetition of things formerly taught, and to deliver the same points and parts of Religion again and again; not thereby to ease themselves, or maintain Idleness, but for the benefit of the Church: for first Men are commonly dull in Hearing, weak in Remembring, slow in practising; and therefore have need that the same things should be often press'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Secondly, Repetition worketh a deeper Impression in us, and serveth to beat it into the Conscience as well as the Understanding.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. AS every Sin is a violation of a Law, so every violation of a Law reflects upon the Law-maker. It is the same offence to Coyn a penny and a <hi>Piece;</hi> the same to counterfeit the Seal of a <hi>Subpaena,</hi> as of a Pardon. The second Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was writ by the Hand of God as well as the first; and the Majesty of God as he is a Law-giver is wounded in an Adultery, and a Theft, as well as in an Idolatry, or a Blasphemy. It is not enough to consider the deformity and the foulness of an Action so, as that an honest Man would not have done it; but so as it violates a Law of God, and his Majesty in that Law: The shame of Men is one bridle that is cast upon us. It is a moral obduration, and in the Suburbs next door to a spiritual obduration to be
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:36907:79"/>
voice-proof, censure-proof, not to be afraid nor ashamed what the World sayes. He that relies upon his <hi>Plaudo Domi,</hi> though the World hiss; I give my self a <hi>Plaudite</hi> at home, I have him at my Table, and her in my bed, whom I would have, and I care not for Rumor; he that rests in such a <hi>Plaudite,</hi> prepares for a Trajedy, a Trajedy in the Amphitheater, the double Theater, this World, and the next too. Even the shame of the World should be one bridle; but the strongest is the other to consider that every such sin is a violation of the Majesty of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. What is given to the Priest is given to the Lord, for he is the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver. Tithes then are due to the Ministers of Christ that liveth, because due to Christ: and thus <hi>Abraham</hi> paid Tithes to <hi>Melchisedec</hi> as a Priest and Type of Christ; and <hi>Melchisedec</hi> Tith'd <hi>Abraham</hi> by the same Divine Right whereby he blessed him: the Minister therefore of Christ blessing the People according to his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, may also receive Tithes of them; and indeed who should receive them for Christ, but those that are in Christs stead. But now a dayes neither Christ can receive his due, nor the Minister his; too many both deny what is due to Christ as God, and to the Priest as a man, not allowing him so much as is fit for his natural sustenance. It was long since (and may stil be so) a just Complaint, that many dealt by their Ministers as Carriers do by their Horses, they laid heavy burdens upon them, and then hung Bells about their necks: hard work, and good words they shall have, but easie Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and slight wages: as if they were of the Camelions kind, and could live by the Ayr.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. The Husband here is to bring his suspected Wife to the place and means of her Tryal. If every Woman suspected might be put away, many Men growing weary of their Wives, would readily entertain any the least flying report, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon take occasion to be Divorc'd from them. Upon this it is Gods Ordinance here, that no innocent person should be oppressed in Judgement, and that none at the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate pleasure of any should be condemned before their Tryal. Every man must hold up his hand at the Bar before he be pronounc'd guilty. No person is to be condemn'd upon suspition only, or presumption, or bare surmize: for were it enough to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, innocency it self could not escape. So that it is not sufficient to Condemn a man, or to accuse him for guilty, to be suspected. Suspition is an another mans heart, or Head, and therefore we cannot alwayes avoid Suspition, except we had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their hearts and heads. We must be careful to avoid the fault, though we cannot the shame, take heed of the sin, though we cannot prevent the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

THese <hi>Nazarites</hi> were diligently to imploy their time about the study of the Law, and therefore as diligently to keep themselves from Wine, and strong Drink, which would make them forget the Law. Drunkenness causeth forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness (hence the Ancients feigned <hi>Bacchus</hi> to be the Son of Forgetfulness) and stands in full opposition to Reason or Religion: when the Wine is in the wit is out. <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, That for a man to think to be Drunk, and yet to keep his right Reason, is to think to drink rank poison, and yet not to dye by it. And upon the same ground it was with this here in the Text, that the Disciples of Christ, those <hi>Nazarites</hi> of the Gospel were enjoyned by our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. to take heed that they were not overcharg'd with <hi>Surfeiting and Drunkenness.</hi> Even the Disciples themselves had in them the common poison of Nature, and so were obnoxious even to the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful evils. Let the best Ministers of the Gospel therefore, the severest <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> have a care of this Evil.

He that would keep clear from great transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, must make a Conscience of all, and avoid not only the gross scandalous stains and blemishes of his Christian profession, but the very first blushes and appearances of evill. As the Spider in the midst of her Web shrinks at the least noise that shakes her work, and retires presently from the danger; so should the perfect Convert shrink at the least noise, whispering, and murmuring of Sin, he should fly the first address and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the Devil in a Temptation, the sight, the roof, the ayr of <hi>Rimmon,</hi> and not bow down with <hi>Naaman,</hi> though to be lean'd upon only.</p>

THe service of the <hi>Gershonites</hi> was not so much as the service of the Sons of <hi>Merari;</hi> and therefore <hi>Moses</hi> doth here proportion the assistance an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the service; two Waggons, and four Oxen to the Sons of <hi>Gershon,</hi> but double the number to the Sons of <hi>Merari,</hi> because their service was double to the others, and their carriage as much more. God knows what every one of his Children is able to bear, and therefore proportions the burthen to the Back; none of his shall be oppressed, though press'd out of measure; afflicted they may be, and that in an high nature, but never brought to despair: left for a time, but not forsaken for ever. <hi>Ioseph</hi> may be shot at, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 23. but he cannot be shot through: <hi>His bow did abide in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Iacob, verse</hi> 24. and thence his safety.

Neither do they bring the best in a sparing manner, but they deal bountifully and liberally. Which teacheth us to serve God with the choicest and chiefest things we have, and that in a large and liberal manner. We read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 36. that the people were so forward for the building and furnishing of the Tabernacles, that the Workmen complained the People brought too much.

behind them, that it might be said our people bring enough. The <hi>Israelites</hi> thought they never brought enough, we think we never bring too little; they offered more than they were commanded; we bring no more than we are compell'd and constrain'd to bring. They offered with a glad and chearful heart, we will do no more than the Law urgeth, or not so much.

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. There was Imposition of Hands upon the <hi>Levite</hi> under the Law, and why not then upon the Minister under the Gospel. Certainly the Ceremony is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, or else it had not been used by Gods people of the Old Testament, nor yet by us that are his People of the New. And thus much it may import: when the <hi>Reverend Man</hi> laies his Hand on thy Head, remember thou art then <hi>manumniz'd</hi> from all secular ties, and sequestred no less from the callings of the People than their vices; thou art then brought before the Lord, as it is in the Text, and dedicated wholly to his Service; and certainly the Holy impression of Episcopal Hands set on from above is such an <hi>Elix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar,</hi> as by contraction, if there be any disposition of goodness in the baser mettal, it will render it of the property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. The <hi>Levites</hi> are here said to be Gods after a more peculiar and special manner than the rest of the People were. For though all the Congregation is Holy even as the <hi>Levites,</hi> all the People of God sanctified as well as his Priests (which was the saying of <hi>Corah</hi> and his Complices, and it was true,) yet they were not sanctified to the same degree of Holiness with the Priests; but they <hi>sicut populus</hi> as Gods people, these <hi>Sicut Aaron</hi> as his peculiar servants; they are holy it is true, but these Holiest of Holies. Hence it was, that when the Law kept ordinations, certain pieces of the Sacrifices were put into the Priests hands, and now instead of that a Bible into ours; not only as a Rule to direct, but as a sacred Witness of that profession into which we are by a Divine hand invested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. All the first-born of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> are mine, saith God here; so they were from the beginning: but here is noted a continuance of this Ordinance, when it is said, <hi>That he sanctified the first-born to himself, what time he smote every first-born in Egypt.</hi> Now the first-born are said to be Gods by a singular right, by right of Redemption; because he Redeemed them, he saved them, he delivered them
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:36907:81"/>
                  <hi>from the house of bondage;</hi> and he that is saved is not his own, but his that saved him. And so the first-born here were Types first of Christ, who was the <hi>first-born among many brethren, Rom.</hi> 8. 29. To whom therefore we must give the honour of his first Birth-right; all our sheaves must veil and bow to his sheaf. Secondly, of Christians, <hi>Those first-born whose Names are written in Heaven, Heb.</hi> 12. 23. who are dear to God, as his first-born.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. THe Paschal Lamb was taken up the Tenth day, but not <hi>Sacrificed</hi> until the fourteenth; that they might so kill the Passover, as first to sanctifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and prepare their Brethren. For which cause also it was a received Tradition among the Jews, that during those four dayes the Lamb was tyed to their Bed-posts, to put them in mind of what they were to do; and then in the Evening they eat it, which signified that Christ came and was offered up in the Evening of the World, <hi>in the last dayes</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>God sent his Son, Heb. 1. 2. In the last hour, 1 Ioh.</hi> 5. when all lay buried in darkness, in the Even-tide of our sin and death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. It appears that these good men, that were shut out from this part of Gods service by reason they were defiled by touching a dead body, were much grieved and troubled in mind that they were bar'd from the Passover; and therefore make earnest complaint to <hi>Moses</hi> for the separation, desiring to be eased and relieved by him. From whence we are taught, that it is a great cause of sorrow and grief to Gods dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they are by any just occasion, or the hand of God upon them, with-held and kept back from the parts and exercises of his Worship. This was the ground of <hi>Davids</hi> complaint in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> where he maketh the condition of the Sparrow and Swallow to be better than his, which might come nearer to the Altar of God than he. But on the other side, Carnal and Worldly men lament bitterly for earthly losses and troubles, but never trouble themselves for the loss of spiritual things. Nay they are vex'd and tormented as if they were upon the rack, that they are constrain'd to come so oft to the Word, to the Sacrament, to the House of Prayer: they cry with them in <hi>Amos, When will the Sabbath be done? Amos</hi> 8. 5. and with those other, <hi>When shall we depart out of Syon? it is time we be gone.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. The <hi>Israelite</hi> here were to eat the Passover with unleavened Bread, with soundness in point of Faith, and sincerity in point of practice, to watch carefully against corruption in Life and Doctrine: which should teach us to be punctual in our prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to, and participation of the Christian Passover, to abstain and purge our selves from the leaven of malice and wickedness, <hi>for a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump:</hi> one spoonful of Vinegar will soon tart a great deal of sweet Milk, but a great deal of Milk will not so soon sweeten one spoonful of Vinegar. The <hi>Israelites</hi> likewise were to eat the Passover here with bitter herbs: to teach, that looking upon Christ, whom they have pierc'd, men should be in bitterness, and feel what an evil and bitter thing sin is; being ready to suffer hardship with Christ, though he should feed us to the full with bitter herbs, and make us drunk with Wormwood; so that at last we be rewarded with the Milk and Honey of an Eternal <hi>Canaan.</hi>

This Cloud was their guide and conduct in all their wayes; when it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they moved, and when it stood still they rested: which should teach thee in all thy wayes to acknowledg and look up to God, and he shall direct thy paths. As God care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully chose out the <hi>Israelites</hi> way in the Wilderness, not the shortest, but yet the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest for them; so will God do for all those that make him their guide. The <hi>Athenians</hi> had a conceit that their Goddess <hi>Minerva</hi> turn'd all their evil Counsels into good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; and the <hi>Romans</hi> thought that their <hi>Visibilia</hi> (another Heathenish Deity) set them again in the right way when at any time they were out. All this, and more
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:36907:81"/>
than this is undoubtedly done by the true God, for all that commit their wayes unto him for direction and success. <hi>Lo this is our God</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>for ever and ever, he will be our guide even unto death, Ps.</hi> 48. 14.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. SEeing these silver Trumpets served for the Camp, and the Congregation, to assemble and remove, and that the power of making them is committed to <hi>Moses,</hi> who hath the sole prerogative to call and dissolve Assemblies about publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; we learn that it belongs to Kings and Princes, as their proper Right to gather together, and to dismiss such as are gathered together. Every one hath not authority to draw multitudes together: we must have lawful and orderly Assemblies. In <hi>Egypt</hi> without <hi>Pharaoh</hi> no man might lift up his hand or foot, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. Secondly, it reproves those that being summoned by the sound of these Trumpets, <hi>i. e.</hi> call'd together by a lawful Magistrate, refuse to come; this was the sin of <hi>Corah</hi> and his Complices. And we know their fearful punishment for that sin. In the natural body the beginning of all motion is from the Head, and so it ought to be in the Body Politick. Thirdly, This reproves those that assemble before they are call'd; <hi>Corah</hi> and his Confederates would not assemble when they were call'd; these assemble before they be call'd; the other were too slow and dull, these are too quick and nimble-headed. So then all must keep their places and standings; they must come when they are call'd; and they must be call'd before they come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. As the Priests here were to sound their silver Trumpets at their solemn Feasts, for a monument of spiritual gladness before the Lord; so must Ministers of the Gospel publish the glad-tidings of the Gospel, <hi>Speak to the heart of Ierusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplish'd, her sin is pardoned, Isai.</hi> 40. 2. Make the people hear the joyful sound, that they may walk in the sence of Gods presence, and in the light of his countenance, which is joy of the Holy Ghost; and upon this account it was, that this and other Musical Instruments used in Gods service (as part of the Jewish Pedagogy) were types of that spiritual joy which we Christians should express in holy duties, no less than if we heard the most exquisite Musick. There should be continual Musick (habitual joy) in Gods Children, who are the Temple of the Holy Ghost: Therefore it was that the Royal Prophet sings, <hi>Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound, Psalm</hi> 80 15. that can discern and feel the comfortable sound of Gods Word, the free use of his Ordinances; serving God with chearfulness, and giving him thanks with exaltation of heart, and rapture of Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 31. Why doth <hi>Moses</hi> so earnestly desire this <hi>Hobab</hi> to be their guide in the way, was not the All-seeing Eye of God sufficient, had not he promised to conduct them, and had they not the pillar of Cloud to go before them? most true: yet hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane helps, when they may be had, and God offers them to our hand, may not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. The using of lawful means doth not oppose or afront the providence of God; who, it is true, can work without means, but yet we must attend unto his will, and not stand upon his naked power without his will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 35. It is a great encouragement to know the forms that the Saints prevailed with <hi>God</hi> of old, that <hi>God</hi> accepted such Prayers at their hands: he that accepted them then, if we send them by the same Spirit, will accept them now. And therefore it is, that we have mention upon Record of the Prayers of <hi>Abraham;</hi> of <hi>Iacob,</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> here and in other places, of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and divers others. To what end and purpose? but that we might thereby learn to fit our selves with words, to attain a habit of Prayer by studying these forms. For which reason also it was, that in the Old Testament for all duties of piety and Religion, there were forms set. For the blessing of the People there was a form set, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. In time of Repentance and Humiliation the Prophet sets them a form, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. and so here when the Ark removed,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:36907:82"/>
there was a form for that Sacrifice; <hi>Arise, O Lord, and let thine Enemies be scattered;</hi> and when the Ark stood still, <hi>Return O Lord to the many thousands of Israel.</hi>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. THe thirst of <hi>Israel</hi> is well quench'd, and now they complain as fast for hunger: the other mutiny for Water was of some few Male-contents; this was of the whole Troop. Not that none were free, <hi>Caleb, Ioshua, Moses, Aaron, Miriam,</hi> were not yet tainted. Usually God measures the state of any Church or Country by the most; the greatest part carries both the Name and Censure. Sins are so much greater as they are universal: so far is evill from being extenuated by the multitude of the guilty, that nothing can more aggravate it. With men commonness may plead for favour, with God it pleads for Judgement. Many hands draw the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with more violence than few. The leprosie of the whole Body is more loathsome than that of the part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. Contentation is a rare Blessing, because it arises either from a frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Comforts, or a not desiring of some which we have not. Now we are never so bare as not to have some benefits; never so full as not to want something. God hath much ado with us, either we lack Health, or Quietness, or Children, or Wealth, or Company, or our selves in all these. We remember when we sate by the flesh-pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and did eat freely of their Cucumbers, and Melons, and Leeks, and Onyons. Every Mind remembers and affects that which is like its self. Carnal minds are for the flesh-pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> though bought with servitude; spiritual are for the presence of God, though Redeem'd with Famine; and would rather dye in Gods presence, than live without him in the sight of delicate and full dishes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. The same hand that rain'd <hi>Manna</hi> into the <hi>Israelites</hi> Tents, could have Rain'd it into their Mouths or Laps; God loves we should take pains for our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al food. Little would it have availed them that the <hi>Manna</hi> lay about their Tents, if they had not gone forth and gathered it, beaten and baked it. Let Salvation be never so plentiful, if we bring it not home, and make it ours by Faith, we are no whit the better. If the work done, and means us'd had been enough to give life, no <hi>Israelite</hi> had dyed: their Bellies were full of that Bread whereof one Crum gives life, yet they dyed many of them in displeasure. As in Natural, so in Spiritual things, we may not trust to means: the Carkals of the Sacrament cannot give life, but the Soul of it, which is the thing represented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. The meat of these <hi>Israelites</hi> was strange, but nothing so strange as their Bread; from the first day that their <hi>Manna</hi> fell till their setling in <hi>Canaan,</hi> God wrought a perpetual miracle in this food, a miracle in the place; other bread rises up from below, this fell down from above, neither did it ever Rain Bread till now; yet so did this Heavenly shower fall, that it is confined to the Camp of <hi>Israel:</hi> a miracle in the quantity, that every morning should fall enough to fill so many hundred thousand maws, and mouths. A miracle in the Composition, that it is sweet like Hony-Cakes, round like Corianders, transparent as dew. A miracle in the quality, that it melted by one heat, by another hardened. A miracle in the difference of the fall, that (as if it knew times, and would teach them as well as feed them) it fell double in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sabbath, and on the Sabbath fell not. A miracle in the continnance and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; that this shower of Bread followed their Camp in all their removals, till they came to tast of the bread of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and then withdrew it self; as if it had said, ye need no miracles now you have means.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. God tells the Jews here that they had wept in his ears; God had heard them weep, but for what, and how? they wept for Flesh: there was a Tincture, a deep die of murmuring in their Tears. Christ goes as far in the passion, in his agony, and he comes to a passionate deprecation in his <hi>tristis anima,</hi> and in this, <hi>Si possibile,</hi> and his <hi>Transeat calix.</hi> But as all these Passions were sanctified in the root, from which no bitter Leaf, nor crooked Twigg could spring; so they were instantly wash'd with his <hi>veruntamen,</hi> a present and a full submitting of all to Gods pleasure, yet <hi>not my will O Father, but thine be done.</hi>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. When our own provision fails, then not to distrust the provision of <hi>God,</hi> is a noble tryal of Faith. <hi>Shall our flocks and herds be slain,</hi> cries even <hi>Moses.</hi> Whereas he should have said, God who stopp'd the mouth of the Sea that it should not devour us, can as easily stop the mouth of our stomack: he that commanded the Sea to stand still and guard us, can as easily command the Earth to nourish us; he that made the Rod a Serpent, can as easily make these stones Bread. Why do we not wait on him whom we have found so powerful? Now they set the Mercy and Love of God upon a wrong Last, while they measure it only by their present sence. While we see our daily Bread on our Cubbord, we believe, let God withdraw his hand, no fight, no trust.</p>

VVHat is this I see? is not this <hi>Aaron</hi> that was Brother in Nature, and by Office joynt Commissioner with <hi>Moses!</hi> and is not this <hi>Miriam</hi> the Elder Sister to <hi>Moses,</hi> which laid her Brother in the Reeds, and fetch'd his Mother to be his Nurse? both Prophets of God, both the Flesh and Blood of <hi>Moses.</hi> And doth <hi>Aaron</hi> repine at the honour of him who gave himself that honour, and saved his life, when he had sinn'd so grosly in making the Calf. Doth this <hi>Miriam</hi> repine at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity of him whose life she saved? But now Envy had so blinded their Eyes, that they could neither see this priviledge of Nature, nor yet the honour of Gods choice. <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> are in mutiny against <hi>Moses.</hi> Who so holy as sins not? What sin though never so unnatural, that even the very best can avoid without God? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, who can look for love and prosperity at once, when holy and meek <hi>Moses</hi> finds enmity in his own flesh and blood? rather than we shall want, a mans Enemies shall be those of his own house. Authority cannot fail of opposition, if it be never so mildly sway'd; that common make-bate the Devil will rather raise it out of our own bosom. To do well, and hear ill, is Princely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. Seditions do not ever look the same way they move; Wise men can easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distinguish betwixt the visor of actions, and the face. The Wife of <hi>Moses</hi> is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, his superiority is shot at. Pride is likely the ground of all sedition. Which of their Faces shined like <hi>Moses?</hi> which of them received the Law twice in two several Tables from Gods own hand? and yet they dare say, <hi>Hath God spoken only by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses?</hi> they do not deny <hi>Moses</hi> his Honour, but they challenge a part with him. And yet how unfit they were: one a Woman whom her Sex debarr'd from Rule; the other a Priest, whom his Office sequestred from Earthly Government. Self-love makes men unreasonable, and teaches them to turn the glass to see themselves greater, others lesser than they are. It is an hard thing for a man willingly and gladly to see his equals lifted over his head in worth and opinion. Nothing will more try a mans grace, then questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Emulation.

They angered him at the waters of strife;</hi> so that it went ill with <hi>Moses</hi> for their sakes: for what reason, see <hi>verse 23.

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. God might have spoken so loud that Heaven and Earth should have heard it, so as they should not have needed to come forth for audience: but now he calls them out to the Bar, that they may be seen to hear. It did not content him to chide them within doors; the shame of their fault had been lesse in a private rebuke, but the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of their repining was publick. Where the sin is not afraid of the light, God loves not the reproof should be smoothered.</p>

It was time to look for a Judgement when God departed: so soon as he is gone from the Eyes of <hi>Miriam,</hi> the Leprosie appears in her face; her foul Tongue is punish'd with a foul Face. Since she would acknowledg no difference betwixt her self, and her Brother <hi>Moses;</hi> every <hi>Israelite</hi> now sees his face glorious, hers leaprous. Deformity is a fit cure of pride. Because the venome of her Tongue would have eaten into the Reputation of her Brother, therefore a poisonous Infection eats into her flesh.

THe basest sort of men are commonly held fit enough for Intelligencers; but <hi>Moses</hi> by the Commandement of the Lord, chooseth forth the best of <hi>Israel,</hi> such as were like to be most judicious in their enquiry, and most credible in their Report. Those that rul'd <hi>Israel</hi> at home, could best descry for them abroad; what should direct the body but the Head? Men can judg but by appearance. It is for him only that sees the event, ere he appoint the means, not to be deceived. It had been better for <hi>Israel</hi> to have sent the Offal of the multitude. By how much less the credit of their persons is, by so much lesse is the danger of seducement. The error of the mighty is arm'd with Authority, and in a sort commands assent; whether in good or Evil, Greatness hath ever a train to follow it at the heels.</p>

I do not hear him say, who am I to strive with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? what can <hi>Ioshua</hi> and I do against ten Rulers? it is better to sit still, than to rise and fall: but he resolves to swim against this stream, and will either draw Friends to the truth, or Enemies upon himself. True Christian fortitude teacheth us not to regard the number or quality of the Opponents, but the Equity of the Cause: and cares not to stand alone and challenge all comers: and if it could be opposed by as many worlds as men, it may be over-born, but it cannot be daunted. Whereas popularity carries weak minds, and teaches them the safety of Erring with a multitude. <hi>Caleb</hi> saw the giantly <hi>Anakims,</hi> and the walled Cities as well as the rest, and yet he saith, <hi>Let us go up and possess it:</hi> as if it were no more but to go and see, and Conquer. Faith is coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and makes nothing of these dangers that daunt others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 31. See the idle Pleas of Distrust; <hi>we are not able, they are stronger.</hi> Could not God inable them? was he not stronger than their Gyants? had he not promised to displace the <hi>Canaanites</hi> to settle them in their stead? how much more easie is it for us to spy their weakness, than for them to espy the strength of their adversaries? when we measure our spiritual success by our own power, we are vanquish'd before we fight: he that would overcome must neither look upon his own arm, nor the arm of his Enemy, but the mouth and hand of him that hath promised, and can perform: who are we flesh and blood with our breath in our Nostrils, that we should fight with <hi>Principalities, Powers, spiritual wickedness in heavenly places?</hi> the matter is too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, we are like Grashoppers to these Gyants. When we compare our selves with them, how can we but despair? when we compare them with God, how can we be discouraged? he that hath brought us into this field hath promised us victory. God knew their strength ere he offered to commit us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 33. It is very material with what Eyes we look upon all subjects. Fear doth not more multiply Evils, than Faith deminisheth them; which is therefore bold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it either sees not, or contemns that terror which fear represents to the weak. There is none so valiant as the Believer. Well might these <hi>Israelites</hi> have thought, were not the <hi>Amalekites</hi> stronger than we, were not they arm'd, we naked. Did not the only hand of <hi>Moses</hi> by lifting up beat them down? Whence had the <hi>Anakims</hi> their strength, but from him that bids us <hi>go up against them?</hi> but now their fear hath not left them so much reason as to compare their adversaries with others, but only with themselves. Doubtless these Giants were mighty, but their fear hath stretch'd them out some Cubits beyond their stature. Distrust makes our dangers greater, and our helps less than they are, and fore-casts ever worse then shall be, and if evills be possible, it makes them certain.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. IT had been time for the <hi>Israelites</hi> to have fallen down on their faces, and have said, go to God for us in your Prayers, go before us in your directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but now on the contrary, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> fall on their faces to them, and sue to them that they would be content to be conducted. Had they been suffered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, they had perished: <hi>Moses</hi> and his few had been victorious: and yet as if he could not be happy without them, he falls on his face to them that they would stay. We have never so much need to be importuned, as in those things whose benefit should make us most importunate. The sweetness of Gods Law, and our promised glory is such, as should draw all hearts after it; and yet if we did not sue to Men (as for life) that they would be reconciled to God, and be saved, I doubt whether they

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. Though <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> intreat upon their faces, and <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb</hi> perswade and rend their Garments, yet they move nothing. The obstinate multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude grown more violent with opposing, is ready to return them stones for their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Such hath been ever the thanks of fidelity and truth; cross'd Wickedness proves desperate, and instead of yielding seeks for Revenge. Nothing is so hateful to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute sinner as good Counsel. We are become Enemies to the World, because we tell them truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. It was not so much <hi>Israel</hi> that <hi>Moses</hi> respected, as God in <hi>Israel.</hi> He was thrifty and zealous for his Maker, and would not have him lose the glory of his mighty deliverances; nor would abide a pretence for any Egyptian Dogg to bark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the powerful work of God; <hi>then the Egyptians shall hear it.</hi> If <hi>Israel</hi> could have perish'd without dishonour to God, perhaps <hi>Moses</hi> his hatred to their unbelief would have overcome his natural love, and he had let gone alone; now so tender is he over the Name of God, that he would rather have <hi>Israel</hi> escape with a sin, then Gods glory should be blemish'd in the opinions of Men by a just Judgement. He saw that the Eyes and Tongues of all the World were intent upon <hi>Israel:</hi> he knew how ready the World would be to miscontrue, and how the Heathens would be ready to cast imputations of Levity, or impotence upon God; and therefore sayes, <hi>Then the Egyptians will hear it.</hi> Happy is that Man that can make Gods glory the scope of all his actions, and desires; nor cares for his own welfare, nor fears the miseries of others, but with respect to God in both.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. THe substance of this Law was to teach them from whence they enjoy'd their Land, their Corn, their Wine, and their Dew, and all that they possessed, to wit, by the meer gift and blessing of God. Whatever we possess, by the sole gift of God we possess it. Of whom shall we receive our Food, if we seek it not at Gods hand; if the Child want Food and Raiment, to whom shall he go but to his Father? and as we have our meat from God, so we must eat and drink as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God. And if we did but seriously think upon this truth, that God is present with us at our Tables, that he sits down, and riseth with us, it would teach us more sobriety and moderation than is commonly used at our meals. It is therefore our duty whatever we have received, whether it be little or much, to imploy it to good uses. We must take special care not to abuse Gods gifts, or wrong any his Creatures we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; in as much as in wronging them we wrong God himself the giver of them.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 38. This Fringe was to put them in mind of the Commandements of the Lord, to do them, as you may read in the following verse; and therefore were termed Philacteries, <hi>i. e.</hi> Conservatories, so called, because by the use of them the Law was kept in remembrance. God had charg'd the Jews to wear these borders for this end; as also to bind the Law to their hands, and before their eyes; wherein (as <hi>St. Ierome</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> well interpret it) God meant the meditations and practice of his Law; but they like unto the foolish Patient, which, when the Physitian bids him take such a Prescript, eats up the paper; they rested in the fringe and not in the garment; in the Ceremony, not in the Law. For if these Jews could but get a list of Parchment upon their left arm next their heart, and another scroll to tye upon their fore-head, and four corners of Fringe, or (if these be denied) a red thread in their hand, though they might say with <hi>Saul, 1 Sam. 16. Blessed be thou of the Lord, I have fulfilled the command of the Lord.</hi>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. I See the Levites not long since drawing their Swords for God and <hi>Moses</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, the rest of <hi>Israel;</hi> and that Fact wins them both praise and blessing: now they are the forwardest in the rebellion against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> men of their own Tribe. There is no assurance of a man for one act: whom one sin cannot fasten upon, another may; yea the same sin may find a repulse one while from the same hand which another time gives it entertainment: and that yeildance looseth the thank of all the former resistance. It is no praise to have done once well unless we continue. We see here likewise that outward priviledges of Blood can avail nothing against a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar calling of God. These <hi>Reubenites</hi> had the right of the natural <hi>primogeniture;</hi> yet do they vainly challenge preheminence where God hath subjected them. If all civil ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour flow from the King, how much more from the God of Kings; his hand exalts the poor, and casts down the mighty from their Throne; the man that will be lifting up himself in the pride of his heart from under the foot of God, is justly trodden in the dust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. There cannot be conceived an honour less worth emulation than this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of <hi>Israel:</hi> a people that could give nothing, a people that had nothing but in hope; a people whom their leader was fain to feed with Bread and Water; which paid him no tribute, but of ill words, whose command was nothing but a burthen; and yet this dignity had drawn together in a mutinous way 250 Captains of <hi>Israel.</hi> What wonder is it, that the Ten-Rulers prevail so much with the multitude, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them from <hi>Canaan;</hi> when three Traytors prevailed thus with 250 Rulers, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the Congregation, and men of renown: one man may kindle such a fire as all the World cannot quench. One Plague-sore may infect a whole Kingdom: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of evil is much worse than the act. It is not like those Leaders of <hi>Israel</hi> could err without followers. He is a mean man that draws not some Clients after him. It hath been ever a dangerous policy of Sathan to assault the best: he knew that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude (as we say of Bees) will follow their Master.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 3. Moses and Aaron you take too much upon you,</hi> was the cry of a Jew once, and so it is still by many now a dayes, who would manacle and confine them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to an Ecclesiastick power, and divest them quite of any civil Authority, though <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> had both, according to St. <hi>Aug.</hi> in 98 <hi>Psal.</hi> and <hi>David</hi> also placeth <hi>Moses</hi> among the Priests, <hi>Ps.</hi> 99. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 5. Moses</hi> argues not for himself, but appeals to God, neither speaks for his own right, but his Brother <hi>Aarons;</hi> he knew that Gods immediate service was worthy to be more precious than his Government. Good Magistrates are more tender over Gods honour than their own, and more sensible of the wrongs offered to Religion than themselves. And <hi>Moses</hi> took the best course to appeal to God. It is safest to trust God with his own cause. If <hi>Aaron</hi> had been set up by <hi>Israel, Moses</hi> would have sheltred him under their Authority: now that God did immediatly appoint him, his patronage is sought whose the Election was. We may easily faulter in the managing of Divine affairs, and so our want of success cannot want sin: God knows how to use, how to bless his own means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. As there was a difference betwixt the people and <hi>Levites,</hi> so betwixt the <hi>Levites</hi> and Priests. The God of order loves to have our degrees kept. Whiles the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> would be looking up to the Priests, <hi>Moses</hi> sends down their Eyes to the people. The way not to repine at those above us, is to look at those below us. There is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remedy for ambition, than to cast up our former receits, and so compare them with our deservings, and confer our own Estate with Inferiors: so shall we find cause to be thankful that we are above any, rather than of envy that any is above us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:36907:85"/>
                  <hi>Verse 12. Moses</hi> hath chid the Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> for mutinying against <hi>Aaron,</hi> and so much the more, because they were of his own Tribe: now he sends for the <hi>Reubenites,</hi> which rose against himself; they come not, and their Message is worse than their absence. <hi>Moses</hi> is accused of Injustice, Cruelty, Falsehood, Treachery, Usurpation, and <hi>Egypt</hi> it self shall be commended rather than <hi>Moses</hi> want a reproach. Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is no shelter from ill tongues, Malice never regards how true an accusation is, but how spiteful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. Now it was time for <hi>Moses</hi> to be angry, they durst not have been thus bold, if they had not seen his mildness. Lenity is ill bestowed upon stubborn natures; it is an injurious sencelesness not to feel the wounds of our reputation. It well appears <hi>Moses</hi> is angry, when he prayes against them. He was displeased before, but when he was most bitter against them, he still prayed for them: but now he bends his very pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers against them; <hi>Look not to their Offering:</hi> there can be no greater revenge, than the imprecation of the righteous; there can be no greater judgement than Gods reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their services. With us men, what more argues the dislike of the person, than the turning back of his present? What will God accept from us if not Prayers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. The same Tongue that prayed against the Conspirators, prayes for the people: as lewd men think to carry it with number; <hi>Corah</hi> had so far prevail'd, that he had drawn the multitude to his side. God the avenger of Treasons would have consumed them at once; <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> pray for the Rebels; although they were worthy of Death, and nothing but Death could stop their mouths; yet their merciful Leaders will not buy their own peace with the loss of such Enemies. O rare and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mercy! the people rise up against their Governors, their Governors fall <hi>on their faces to God for the people;</hi> so far are they from plotting revenge, that they will not endure God shall revenge for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 27. Moses</hi> had well hoped that when these Rebels should see all the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> run from them as from Monsters, and should hear that direful Proclamation of Vengeance against them, (howsoever they did before set a face on their Conspiracy, yet now) their hearts would have misgiven. But loe these bold Traytors, stand impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently staring in the door of their Tents, as if they would out-face the revenge of God; as if <hi>Moses</hi> had never wrought miracle before them; as if no <hi>Israelite</hi> had ever bled for rebelling: those that should perish are blinded. Pride and Infidelity obdures the heart, and makes even Cowards fearless.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 31. In <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abirams</hi> case God may seem to proceed apace towards Execution, but yet it had all these pauses in arrest of Judgement, and these reprieves before Execution. First, When <hi>Moses</hi> had information of their factious proceedings, he falls upon his face before God, and laments, and deprecates in their behalf, <hi>verse</hi> 4. he calls them to a fair Tryal and Examination the next day, <hi>verse</hi> 5. and they say, <hi>We will not come, verse</hi> 12. and again which implies that <hi>Moses</hi> cited them again, we <hi>will not come, verse</hi> 14. and <hi>Moses</hi> went up to them again, and the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> followed, and all prevailed not, and then <hi>Moses</hi> comes to pronounce Judgement, <hi>verse</hi> 29. and after, and yet not presently after the Judgement Execution followed, <hi>verse</hi> 31. thus still God goes his own way to speak before he strikes, to lighten before he thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to warn before he wounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 41. Here instead of Praying, these <hi>Israelites</hi> murmur; instead of praying to God, murmur against <hi>Moses. What have the righteous done?</hi> It is the hard condition of Authority, that when the multitude fare well, they applaud themselves; when ill, they repine against their Governors. Who can hope to be free, if <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> escape not? Never any Prince so merited a people; he thrust himself upon the Pikes of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> tyranny; he brought them from a bondage worse than death; his Rod divided the Sea, and shared life to them, death to their pursuers. Who would not have thought these men so obliged to <hi>Moses,</hi> that no death could have opened their mouths, or rais'd their hands against him: yet now when their fellows are justly punish'd of God, they murmur against <hi>Moses.</hi> No marvel if we deal so with men, when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:36907:85"/>
this measure from us. One year of Famine, one Summer of Pestilence makes us over-look all the blessings of God; and more to mutiny at the sence of our evil, than to praise him for our varieties of good. O God, I have made an ill use of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, if I have not learnt to be content with thy Corrections.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. HOw desirous was God to give satisfaction, even to the obstinate! there is nothing more material than that men should be assured their spiritual guides have their commission and Calling from God: the want whereof is a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to our success. It should not be so; but the corruption of Men will not receive good, but from due Messengers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. Before Gods calling all men are alike: every Name is alike written in their rod; there is no difference in the letters, in the wood; neither the characters are fairer, nor the staff more precious; it is the choice of God that makes the distinction: so is it in our callings of Christianity; all are equally devoid of possibility of Grace, all equally liveless, by Nature we are all Sons of wrath: If we be now better than others, who separated us? we are all Crab-stocks in this Orchard of God, he may graft what Fruit he pleases upon us; only the Grace and effectual Calling of God makes the difference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. Before God wrought miracles in the Rod of <hi>Moses;</hi> now in the Rod of <hi>Aaron.</hi> As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> might see himself in <hi>Moses</hi> his Rod; who of a Rod of Defence and protection, was turn'd into a venemous Serpent: so <hi>Israel</hi> might see themselves in the Rod of <hi>Aaron.</hi> Every Tribe, and every <hi>Israelite</hi> was of himself as a sear-stick without life, without sap; and if any one of them had power to live and flourish, he must acknowledg it from the immediate power and gift of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. These 12 Heads of <hi>Israel</hi> would never have writ their Names in their Rods, but in hope they might be chosen to this dignity. What an honour was this Priesthood whereof all the Princes of <hi>Israel</hi> are ambitious? If they had not thought it an high preferment, they had not so much envied the Office of <hi>Aaron.</hi> What shall we think of this change? Is the Evangelical administration of less worth than the Levitical? while the Testament is better, is the service worse? how is it that the Great think themselves too great for this imployment? how is it that under the Gospel men are disparaged with that which honoured them under the Law, that their ambition and scorn meet in one subject?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. These 12 Rods are not laid up in several Cabinets of their owners; but are brought forth and laid before the Lord. It is fit God should make choice of his own attendants. Even we Men hold it injurious to have servants obtruded upon us by others. Never shall that Man have comfort in his Ministry whom God hath not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen. The great Commander of the World hath set every Man in his station: to one he hath said, Stand thou in this Tower and watch; to another, Make thou good these Trenches; to a third, Digg thou in this Mine. He that gives, and knows our abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, can best set us on work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. This Rod was the Pastoral staff of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the great Shepheard of <hi>Israel:</hi> God rectifies his approbation of his charge by the Fruit. That a Rod cut off from the Tree should blossom it was strange; but that in one Night it should bear buds, blossom, and Fruit, and that both ripe and hard, it was highly miraculous. The same power that revives the dead Plants in Winter in the Spring, doth it here without Earth, without Time, without Sun; that <hi>Israel</hi> might see, and grant it was no reason his choice should be limited, whose power is unlimited.</p>

The Name of <hi>Aaron</hi> was not more plainly writ in that Rod, than the sin of <hi>Israel</hi> was in the Fruit of it: and how much more <hi>Israel</hi> finds Rebellion bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with this Rod, appears in the following Complaint, <hi>Behold we are dead, we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</hi> God knows how to extort glory to his own Name from the most obstinate gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers.</p>

IF the Lord himself be <hi>Aarons</hi> portion, and his Inheritance, why should not <hi>Aaron</hi> content himself, though he have no other Inheritance among the People. And if the Lord be the portion of Gods Children, who are his Royal Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, why should not they rest well contented, although they want an inheritance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the things of this World? and why may not every Child of God as well as the Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> say? <hi>God himself is my portion, and God all-sufficient in himself, is all-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto me.</hi> God gave me to my self, and God gave himself to me. God the Father gave his Son to me, God the Son gave himself to me; and God the Holy Ghost gave his Seal to assure that gift to me, and shall I not be content? God the Son received all things from the Father for me, that in him and through him, and with him I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all things from the Father, and why should I not content my self with him, without whom all things are as nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 31. The end of the gifts and oblations under the Law, was not that God had reserved these things for his own spending, but for the use and sustentation of his selected Servants; that so being alwayes to have Ministers of his own, he might have also of his own Goods to feed and maintain them. This I take to be clear from Gods own words in this Chapter; for having set his mark upon divers things, calling them, <hi>My Gifts and my Offerings,</hi> he adds, <hi>These have I given to the Sons of Levi for the service they do me in the Tabernacle, verse 21. And it is your wages which I give you for your service,</hi> in this verse: which words plainly shew, that God would that such as attend him, should receive their maintenance as his pay, and not as mans. Whereupon he saith not to the people, you shall give them your offerings, for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they do you; <hi>But I have given them my Offerings for the service they do me;</hi> as if he should say, these things are mine, not yours, to me you shall pay them, that as mine, not as yours, they may receive them, and so I may pay them with my own hands, and of my own Goods, and not they to serve at others cost.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. This red Heifer was the type of Christ crucified, who as (a Father saith) was <hi>Candidus sanctitate, rubicundus passione,</hi> white and ruddy; white in his Innocency, and red in his Passion. And this Heifer must be without spot and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish; our Saviour was free from all sin, the spot of Original, and the blemish of Actual Sin. It must be a Heifer likewise on which never came yoke. Christ never bore the yoke either of sin or slavery: he offered up himself, he was a willing Sacrifice, he was not fore'd and drawn to it. It is true, there was a necessity of our Saviours Death, but it was a necessity of immutability, (because God had so decreed it, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23.) not of Co action. <hi>He dyed willingly,</hi> therefore when he gave up the Ghost, he
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:36907:86"/>
cryed with a loud voice; which shews his life was not then spent, he might have kept it longer if he would. Lastly, this Heifer was to be brought by the people, at the common charge, because for the common good. All the Congregation must get them a bloody Saviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. The burning of the Heifer with the Garbage and Dung could yeild no sweet savour, but thereto was added Cedar-wood, and Hysop by Gods appointment, and then there was a savour of rest in it. Our Prayers as from us would never please; hut as indited by the Spirit, and presented by Christ, they are highly accepted in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Nay our sins were so odious to God, that even Christ himself, when burnt up with the fire of his Fathers wrath, had no savour in him in respect of our sins: but by <hi>the everlasting Spirit, whereby he offered up himself without spot to God, he was a full Sacrifice of sweet smelling Incense to purge offences:</hi> for the Spirit of God gave both value and vertue to his Death, both to satisfie and to sanctifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. The gathering of the ashes is the applying of the merits of Christ, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on the mysteries of his Kingdom. The laying up of the ashes imports, that the Christian accounts Christ merits his chief Treasure. The clean place is the clean heart: without the Camp, notes that the Gentiles were <hi>strangers to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Israel.</hi> These ashes kept for the Congregation, shew the fulness of Christs merits for all his people. When he saith, <hi>It is to make a water of separation,</hi> it notes, that our Sins separate betwixt us and our God; but now <hi>in Christ Iesus we who some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were far off, are made nigh in his blood, Eph.</hi> 2. 13.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. ALl <hi>Israel</hi> murmured when they wanted Bread and Flesh, and yet all <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> departed into the desart of <hi>Zin</hi> at Gods command. The very worst men will obey God in something, none but the good in all. He is rarely desperate that makes an universal opposition to God. It is an unsound praise that is given a man for one good action. It may be safely said of the very Devils themselves, that they do something well, <hi>they know, and believe, and tremble.</hi> If we follow God, and murmur, it is all one as if we had stayed behind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. Those begin to distrust Gods providence in this verse in their necessity, that in the former were ready to follow his guidance in their welfare. It is an harder matter to endure in extream want, than to obey an hard Commandment. Sufferings are greater tryals than actions. And God will have his throughly tryed; he puts them to both, and if we cannot endure both, to follow him into the Wilderness of <hi>Zin,</hi> and then to thirst in <hi>Rephidim,</hi> we are not sound <hi>Israelites.</hi> God set them on purpose to this dry place, he could as well have conducted them to another <hi>Elim,</hi> to convenient waterings: or he that gives the waters of all their Channels, could as well have deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to meet <hi>Israel;</hi> but God doth purposely carry them to thirst. It is not of necessity that we fare ill, but of choice. It is all one with God to give us health as sickness, aboundance as poverty; the treasure of his riches hath more store than his Creature can be capable of; we should not complain if it were not good for us to want.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. I looked to hear when they would have entreated <hi>Moses</hi> to pray for them, but instead of intreating they contend, and instead of Prayers, chide and murmur. If they had gone to God without <hi>Moses,</hi> I should have prais'd their Faith: but now they go to <hi>Moses</hi> without God, I hate this stubborn Faithlesness; to seek to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond means, with neglect of the first, is the Fruit of a false Faith. But why do these mutiners say, <hi>O that we had dyed as our Brethren did before the Lord?</hi> and before whom do ye dye O ye fond <hi>Israelites,</hi> if you must perish by thirst? God carried you forth, God restrain'd his creatures from you, God is still present with you; and yet you
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:36907:87"/>
say, while you are to dye for want of Water in the presence of God, <hi>O that we had dyed before the Lord.</hi> These <hi>Israelites</hi> loved their lives well enough. I heard how they screek'd while they were in danger of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and yet now they say, <hi>O that we had dyed.</hi> Although life be naturally sweet, yet a little discontentment makes us wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It is a base cowardliness, as soon as ever we are call'd from the Garrison to the Field, to think of running away. Then is our fortitude worthy of praise, when we can endure to be miserable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 4. Why brought ye us up hither,</hi> say the <hi>Israelites?</hi> when they should have said, God hath led us hither; this should have been a contentment able to quench a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thirst. If <hi>Moses</hi> out of ignorance had misguided us, or we changeably fallen upon these dry desarts, though this were no remedy of our grief, yet it might be some ground of our complaint. But now the Counsel of so wise and Merciful a God hath drawn us into this want; and shall he not as easily find the way out? <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what he will;</hi> there can be no more forcible motive to patience, than the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Divine hand that strikes us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. It was no Expostulating with an unreasonable multitude: <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> run straight to him, that was able at once to quench their thirst, and their fury, they went from the Congregation to the door of the Tabernacle. It is the best way to trust God with his own Causes, when men will be intermedling with his affairs, they undo themselves in vain. We shall find difficulties in all great enterprises: if we be sure we have begun them from God, we may securely cast all events upon his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which knows how to dispose, and how to end them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. Out of a stone Water cannot be drawn but by miracles, though it be twice striken; as <hi>Moses</hi> here stroke the Rock twice, yet the water came by the miraculous power of God, and not by <hi>Moses</hi> second stroke. Though God strike twice, thrice, man will not weep. Though inward terrors strike his Conscience, and outward diseases strike his body, and calamities and ruine strike his Estate, yet he will not confess by one tear, that these are Judgements of God, but natural accidents; or if Judgements, that they proceed not from his sin, but from some decree in God, or from some purpose in God to glorifie himself by thus afflicting; and that if he had been better he should have fared never the better, for Gods purpose must stand.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. IT was their way that makes them repine, they were fain to go round about <hi>Idumea,</hi> the Journy was long and troublesome. They had sent intreaties to <hi>Edom</hi> for License of passage the next way reasonably submisly: it was churlishly denied them. <hi>Esau</hi> lives still in his posterity, <hi>Iacob</hi> in <hi>Israel;</hi> the Combate which they began in <hi>Rebecca's</hi> room is not yet ended. So long as there is a World, there will be opposition to the chosen of God: they may come at their peril; the way had been nearer, but bloody; they dare not go it, and yet complain of length. If they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to purchase their resting-place with War, how much less would they their passage. What should God do with impatient Men? they will not go the nearest way, and yet complain to go about. He that will pass to the promised Land, must neither stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on length of way, nor difficulty. Every way hath his Inconveniences, the nearest hath more danger, the farthest hath more pain; either or both must be overcome if ever we will enter the rest of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 5. Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> were now past the danger of their mutinies; for want of another match they joyn God with <hi>Moses</hi> in their murmurings: though they had not formerly mention'd him, yet they could not fever him from <hi>Moses</hi> in their Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: for in the causes of his own Servants he challenges even when he is not chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged. <hi>What will become of thee O Isral, when thou makest thy Maker thine enemy.</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:36907:87"/>
Impatience is Cousin to Frenzy; this causes men not to care upon whom they run, so they may breath out some Revenge. How oft have we heard men that have been displeased by others, tear the Name of their Maker in pieces? he that will Judge, and can confound, is fetch'd into the Quarrel without Cause. But if to strive with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man be unwise, and unsafe, what shall it be to strive with the mighty God. And what was the ground of this murmuring? <hi>Our Soul loat heth this light bread.</hi> This Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bread was unspeakably delicious, it tasted like waters of Honey, and yet even this Angels food is cuntemn'd. He that is full despiseth an Honey-comb. How sweet and delicate is the Gospel! not only the Fathers of the Old-Testament, but the Angels desired to <hi>look into the glorious mysteries of it,</hi> and yet we are cloyed. This superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Food is too light, the bread-corn of our humane reason, and profound discourse would better content us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. These men when the Spies had told them news of the Gyants of <hi>Canaan,</hi> a little before had wish'd, <hi>Would God we had dyed in the Wilderness.</hi> Now God hath heard their Prayers, what with the Plague, what with the Serpents, many thousands of them dyed. The ill wishes of our impatience are many times heard. As those good things are not granted which we pray for without care, so those evils which we pray for, and would not have, are oft granted. The ears of God are not only open to the Prayers of Faith, but to imprications of Infidelity. It is dangerous wishing evill to our selves, or ours; it is just with God to take us at our word, and to effect that which our Lips speak against our Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. Now the people are glad to seek to <hi>Moses</hi> unbidden. Even heretofore they have been wont to be sued to and intreated for, without their own intreaty; now their misery makes them importunate. There needs no Solicitor where there is sence of smart. It were pitty men should want affliction, since it sends them to their Prayers, and Confessions. All the perswasions of <hi>Moses</hi> could not do that which the Serpents have done for him. O God thou seest how necessary it is we should be stung some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, else we should run wild, and never come to a sound humiliation; we should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seek thee if thy hand did not find us out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. The <hi>Israelites</hi> being stung with Serpents, erected a Serpent in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>Serpens momordit, Serpens curavit,</hi> the Philistines being plagued with Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roids, offered Emeroides unto the Ark. They that gave their Jewels to the making of a Calf, did afterwards bestow them on the Lords Tabernacle. And <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> who was wont to send forth alluring beams into the eyes of her Paramours, now the same Eyes send forth a deluge of Tears.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 1. MOab</hi> and <hi>Midian</hi> had been all this while standers by, and lookers on: If they had not seen the pattern of their own ruine in their Neighbours; it had nevet troubled them to see the Kings of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and <hi>Bashan</hi> to fall before <hi>Israel.</hi> Had not the <hi>Israelites</hi> Camp'd in the Plains of <hi>Moab,</hi> their Victories had been no Eye-sore to <hi>Balack.</hi> Wicked men never care to observe Gods Judgements till themselves be touch'd: the fire of a Neighbours House would not so affect us, if it were not with the danger of our own: Secure minds never startle till God come home to their sences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. The <hi>Midianites</hi> joyn with the <hi>Moabites</hi> in Consultation, in Action against <hi>Israel:</hi> one would have thought they should have look'd for favour from <hi>Moses</hi> for <hi>Iethro</hi>'s sake, who was both a Prince in their Country, and Father in Law to <hi>Moses:</hi> and either now, or not long before was with <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness. Neither is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like but that <hi>Moses</hi> having found forty years harbour among them, would have been (what he might) inclineable to favourable treaties with them; but now they are so fast
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:36907:88"/>
link'd to <hi>Moab,</hi> that they will either sink or swim together. Intireness with wicked consorts, is one of the strongest Chains of Hell, and binds us to a participation both of sin and punishment: an easie occasion will knit wicked hearts together in conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy against the Church of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. Their Errand is Divelish, <hi>(Come curse Israel)</hi> that which Sathan could not do by the Sword of <hi>Og</hi> and <hi>Seon,</hi> he will now try to effect by the Tongue of <hi>Balaam.</hi> If either strength or policy would prevail against Gods Church, it could not stand. And why should not we be as industrious to promote the glory of God, and bend both our hands and heads to the causes of the Almighty? When all helps fail <hi>Moab,</hi> the Magician is sent for: it is the sign of a desperate Cause to make Sathan either our Counsellor, or Refuge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. I should wonder to hear God speak with a false Prophet; if I did not know, it hath been no rare thing with him, (as with men) to bestow words where he will not bestow favour. Not the sound of the voice of God, but the matter which he speaks ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues love: he may speak to an Enemy; he speaks peace to none but his own. It is a vain bragg, God hath spoken to me; so may he do to Reprobates, or Devils; but what said he? Did he say to my Soul, <hi>I am thy Salvation?</hi> hath he indented with me, <hi>that he will be my God, and I shall be his?</hi> I cannot hear this voice, and not live. God heard all the Consultation and Message of these <hi>Moabites;</hi> these Messengers could not have moved their Foot or their Tongue, but in him; and yet he which ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Adam</hi> where he was, asks <hi>Balaam, What men are these?</hi> I have ever seen that God loves to take occasion of proceeding with us from our selves, rather than from his own immediate prescience. Hence it is that we lay open our Wants, and confess our sins to him that knows both, better than our own hearts, because he will deal with us from our own mouths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. The reward of the divination had easily commanded the Journey and Curse of the Covetous Prophet, if God had not stayed him. How oft are Wicked men Curs'd by a Divine hand, even in those sins which their Hearts stand to. It is no thank to lewd men that their Wickedness is not prosperous. Whence it is, that the World is not over-run with Evil, but from this, that Men cannot be so ill as they would.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. Where Wickedness meets with power, it thinks to command all the World, and takes great scorn of any repulse. So little is <hi>Balack</hi> discouraged for one refusal, that he sends so much the stronger Message, more Princes, and more Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. O that we could be so importuuate for our good, as Wicked Men are for the compassing of their designs! a Denial doth but whet the desires of vehement Suitors. Why are we faint in Spiritual things, when we are not denied, but delayed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. We that see only the outside of <hi>Balaam,</hi> may wonder why he that permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to go, afterward opposeth his going; but God that saw his Heart, perceived what corrupt affections carried him: he saw that his covetous desires, and wicked hopes grew the stronger, the nearer he came to his end: an Angel is therefore sent to with-hold the hasty Sorcerer. Our inward disposition is the life of our actions, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that doth the God of Spirits judge us, whiles men censure according to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal motions. To go at all when God had commanded to stay, was presumptuous; but to go with a desire to Curse, made the act doubly sinful, and fetcht an Angel to resist it. It is one of the worthy employments of good Angels to make secret oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to evill designs: many a wicked act have they hindred without the knowledg of the Agent. It is all one with the Almignty to work by Spirits and Men; it is therefore our glory to be thus set on Work: to stop the course of evill either by disswasion or violence is an Angelical service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 28. That no man may marvel to see <hi>Balaam</hi> have visions from God, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Prophecies from him; his very Ass hath his Eyes opened to see the Angel, which his Master could not, and his mouth opened to speak more reasonably than his Master. There is no Beast deserves so much wonder as this of <hi>Balaam,</hi> whose common sence is advanc'd above the Reason of his Rider, so as for the time the Prophet is brutish, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:36907:88"/>
the Beast Prophetical; who can but stand amaz'd at the Eye, at the Mouth of this sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Creature? for so dull a sight it was much to see a bodily object, that were not too apparent; but to see that Spirit which his Rider discern'd not, was far beyond Nature. To hear a Voice to come from that Mouth which was used only to bray, it was strange and uncouth; but to hear a Beast whose Nature is noted for incapacity, to out-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son his Master a professed Prophet, is in the very height of Miracles. Yet no heart can stick at these that considers the dispensation of the Almighty in both. Our Eye could no more see a Beast, than a Beast can see an Angel, if he had not given this power to it: and if his power can make the very Stones to speak, how much more a Creature of sense: we may wonder we cannot distrust, when we compare the act with the Author, which can as easily Create a Voice without a Body, as a Body without a Voice. There is no Mouth into which God cannot put words: and how oft doth he chose <hi>the weak and unwise to confound the Learned, and Mighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 32. I hear the Angel of God taking notice of the cruelty of <hi>Balaam</hi> to his Beast: his first words to the unmerciful Prophet are in expostulating the wrong. We little think it, but God shall call us to an account for the cruel, unmerciful usage of his poor mute Creatures. He hath made us Lords, not Tyrants: Owners, not Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; he that hath given us leave to kill them for our use, hath not given us power to abuse them at our pleasure; they are so our Drudges, as that they are our Fellows by Creation. It was a signe the Magician would easily strike <hi>Israel</hi> with a Curse, when he wish'd for a Sword to strike his harmless Beast. It is ill falling into those hands whom Beasts find unmerciful.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. WHo can doubt whether <hi>Balaam</hi> were a false Prophet, who sees him Sacrificing in the <hi>Mount of Baal?</hi> had he been from the true God, he would rather have said, <hi>Pull me down these Altars of Baal, then build me here seven others.</hi> The very place convinces him of falsehood and Idolatry: and why seven Altars? what needs all this pomp, when the True God never requir'd but one at once, as himself is one? Why doth the false Prophet call for no less than seven? as if God stood upon numbers; as if the Almighty would have his power either divided, or limited. Here is nothing but a great and magnificent pretence of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It hath been ever seen, that the false Worshippers of God have made more pompous shews, and fairer flourishes of their Piety and Religion than the true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. Now when <hi>Balaam</hi> sees his seven Bullocks, and seven Rams smoking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on seven Altars, he goes up higher into the Mount (as some counterfeit <hi>Moses)</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the answer of God. But will God meet with a Sorcerer? Will he make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of a Magician? O Man, who shall prescribe God what Instruments to use? he knows how to imploy not only Saints and Angels, but Wicked Men, Beasts, Devils, to his own glory: he that put words into the mouth of the Ass, put words into the mouth of <hi>Balaam;</hi> the words do but pass from him; they are not polluted because they are not his; as the Trunk through which a Man speaks is not more Eloquent for the speech that is uttered through it. What a notable Proclamation had the Infidels wanted of Gods favour to his people, if <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Tongue had not been used? how many shall once say, <hi>Lord, we have Prophecied in thy Name;</hi> that shall hear, <hi>Verily I know you not.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 28. What madness is this in <hi>Balaam,</hi> that hopes to change success with pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? as if God were not the same every where. Neither was that bold fore-head asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to importune God again in that wherein his own Mouth had testified an assurance of Denial. The reward was in one of his Eyes, the Revenging Angel in another: I
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:36907:89"/>
know not whether for the time he more lov'd the Bribe, or fear'd the Angel: and whiles he is in this distraction, his Tongue blesseth against his Heart, and his Heart cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses against his Tongue; it angers him that he dares not speak what he would, and now at last; rather than lose his hopes, he resolves to speak worse then Curses: the fear of Gods Judgements in a Worldly Heart, is at length overcome with the love of gain.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. THose that are themselves transported with vanity and ambition, think that no Heart hath power to resist these Offers. <hi>Balam</hi> thought he had struck the business when he had once mentioned Promotion to great Honour. Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love makes him think that all the World would be glad to run a madding after his bait. Nature thinks it impossible to contemn Honour and Wealth; and because too many Souls are thus taken, cannot believe that any would escape. But let Carnal Minds know there are those that can spit the World in the face and say, <hi>Thy Gold and Silver perish with thee:</hi> and that in comparison of a good Conscience, can tread un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot his best proffers like shadows as they are, and that can do as <hi>Balaam</hi> said, <hi>verse 13.

What was this sin of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> for which God threatneth, <hi>That they shall perish for ever?</hi> It was that (according to Interpreters) mentioned <hi>Exod. 17. Remember how Amalekmet thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of you;</hi> this Sin slept all the time of the Judges, yet so soon as <hi>Israel</hi> had a King, and that King setled in peace, God gives charge to call them to an account, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. As we use to say of Winter, so may we say of Gods Judgements, They never rot in the Sky, but shall fall, if late, yet surely, yet seasonably. There is smal comfort in the delay of Vengeance, while we are sure it shall lose nothing in the way by length of Protraction.</p>

                  <hi>Verse 24. Balaam</hi> here Prophesieth of the rising and falling of great Princes, and Empires: they had their Heads lifted up on high, and were advanced to the greatest honour, but suddenly they came tumbling down, <hi>and all their glory lay in the dust;</hi> From whence we learn, that great Men, and mighty Princes suddenly decay, and come to nothing; they are in a moment cast down and left destitute, when they little think of it. Neither can we marvail at this change of the Places and Estates of the Sons of Men, seeing it is the Lords doing, and the work of his right hand. The Lord lifteth up and pulleth down according to his own will and pleasure, who maketh the highest Tide to have the lowest Ebb.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. AS the sins of great Men are exemplary, so are their punishments. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing procures so much credit to Government, as Impartial Executions of Noble Offendors. Those whom their sins have debased, deserve no favour in the punishment. As God knows no Honour, no Royalty in matter of sin, no more may his Deputies. Contrarily, Connivence at the outrages of the Mighty cuts the sinews of any State. If good Laws turn once to Spiders webs which are broken through by the bigger Flies, no hand will fear to sweep them down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. Now the sin is punish'd the Plague ceaseth. The revenge of God sets out ever after the sin; but if the revenge of Men which commonly comes later, can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, God gives over the Chase. How often hath the infliction of a less punishment
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:36907:89"/>
avoided a greater. There are none so good Friends to a State as couragious and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Ministers of Justice: these are the Reconcilers of God and the people, more than the Prayers of them that sit still and do nothing.</p>

Our first Mother <hi>Fve</hi> bequeathed this Dowry to her Daughters, that they should be our helpers to sin, the weaker Sex is the stronger in this Conquest. Had the <hi>Moabites</hi> sent their subtilest Counsellors to perswade the <hi>Israelites</hi> to their Idol Sacrifices, they had been repell'd with scorn; but now the beauty of their Women is over-eloquent and succesful. That which in the first World betrayed the Sons of God, hath now betray'd Gods People. It had been happy for <hi>Israel</hi> if <hi>Balaam</hi> had used any Charms but these. As it is the use of God to fetch glory to himself out of the worst actions of Satan; so it is the guise of that Evil-one to raise advantage to himself from the fairest pieces of the Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God.

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. THey were indeed famous in regard of their places, but they became Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and Ignominous by their Sin and Punishment. Irreligion and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety make Men reproachful, of what account and estimation soever they be; be they never so Rich, Noble, and Renouned in the World: how famous and excellent in the World, Countries and Cities be; yet this is certain, that Sin maketh all Persons and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces infamous and dishonourable, (let <hi>London</hi> apply this to her self) as it appears after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in this Chapter, <hi>verse</hi> 61. We see this further in many Examples; <hi>Cain</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and marked of God for his execrable parricide unto all posterity <hi>Iudas</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed his Master, is called the <hi>Son of Perdition, Iohn</hi> 17. and is as it were burnt in the shoulder with the letter <hi>R,</hi> and mark'd out for a Reprobate, and left upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to be <hi>a Devil, Iohn</hi> 6. 70. that all which hear of it might fear, and learn to hate his sins.</p>

                  <hi>Verse 10. Corah</hi> kindled the fire, the two hundred and fifty Captains brought sticks to it; all <hi>Israel</hi> warm'd themselves by it; only the Incendiaries perish. God and <hi>Moses</hi> knew to distinguish betwixt the Head of a Faction, and the train, though neither be faultless; yet two hundred and fifty Ringleaders are plagued, the other forgiven. Gods vengeance when it is at the hottest, makes differences of Men. We may collect from this Verse likewise, that all the Elements are at Gods service. For we find here two sorts of Traytors; the Earth swallowed up the one, the Fire the other: and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this Book <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> brought fit persons, but unfit fire to God; so these <hi>Levites</hi> bring the right fire, but unwarranted persons before him; Fire from God consumes both. It is a dangerous thing to usurp sacred Functions. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery will not grace the Man, the Man may disgrace the Ministery; and shall be sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally punish'd for it, as <hi>Corah</hi> and his fellow-Rebels were here, <hi>who were made a signe,</hi> saith the Text. Death is the just Heir of the least sin; but some evill Doers God doth not put to Death, but also hangs them up in Gibbets as it were, for publick notice and admonition. Those that are famous in their sin, shall be famous in their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. This Tribe of <hi>Simeon</hi> is of a smaller number in respect of the other Tribes; and the reason is to be taken out of the last History recorded in the former Chapter: where we find that one of the Princes of the Tribe of <hi>Simeon</hi> being accompanied with many others of that Tribe, committed a most shameful act among his Brethren, and brought in a <hi>Midianitish</hi> Harlot into the Host in the sight of <hi>Moses.</hi> Whereby it came to pass, that the greatest number of that Tribe perished with him in that grievous Plague; for it was reason that they which did partake with him in the sin, should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:36907:90"/>
together in the punishment. Which may teach us, that it is a very hard thing to avoid and break off our society with Wicked Men; and reproveth all such as enter into league with such persons; they even offer their hands and feet to be bound as it were with chains, and they become afterwards as Prisoners and Vassals to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 33. Zelophahad</hi> the Son of <hi>Heber, had no Sons, but all Daughters,</hi> saith this Text; and yet these Daughters had a share with the rest of Gods people in the Land of Promise, as we may read in the next Chapter. And therefore let the <hi>French</hi> defend their <hi>Salike</hi> Law as they can, there is very good reason that Women should not lose the right of Inheritance. For Women are the second edition of the Epitome of the whole World; witness <hi>Artemisia, Blandina, Zenobia,</hi> in whom besides their Sex, there was nothing Woman-like or weak; as if (what Philosophy speaks) the Souls of those Noble Creatures had followed the temperament of their Bodies, which consists of rarer rooms, of a more exact Composition than Mans doth, and (if place be any privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg) we find theirs built in Paradice, when Mans was made out of it: besides <hi>in Iesus Christ there is neither Male nor Female, but all are one,</hi> (Souls have no Sexes) <hi>and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever are Christs, are heirs to the Promise.</hi>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 54. God provideth sufficiently for all his People; every Man hath his porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on assign'd him of God upon the Earth. It is his will and pleasure that all should have their measure of earthly things, not some to have all, and some nothing at all, but all to have some part, and that part to be enough. God would have no Beggar in his <hi>Israel;</hi> when the Lord sent down <hi>Manna,</hi> and fed his people with Angels food, all the Host from the highest to the lowest had enough. <hi>They that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack, Exod.</hi> 16. Now if God be thus careful to feed our bodies, it is much more reason that we should seek at his hands the nourishment of our Souls. This is the voice of Faith, the other the voice of Nature. Nature will tell us when we want provision for the body; but 'tis the Office of Faith to tell us when we want food for the Soul. Therefore saith Christ, <hi>First seek the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Mat.</hi> 6. 33.</p>

Amram</hi> here took to Wife <hi>Iochebeb,</hi> which was his own Aunt, as is clear from <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 20. the Law against Incest was not then given, nor the state of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> then setled; and therefore it was no sin in him: for where there is no Law there can be no sin. But what shall we say to our modern Sectaries, whose practising of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest is now avowed publickly in print: they shame not to affirm, that those Marriages are most lawful, that are betwixt persons iu blood. The prohibition of degrees in <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticus,</hi> are to be understood, say they, of Fornication, not of Marriage. I see here what noon-day Devils do now in this unhappy Age, walk with open face amongst us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 61. Because <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> this made God the more to stomack, and the rather to revenge this Impiety. God had both pardoned and graced their Father; he had honoured them, of the thousands of <hi>Israel,</hi> culling them out for his Altar: and now as their Fathers set up a false God, so they bring false fire unto the true <hi>God.</hi> If the Sons of Infidels live Godlesly, they do but their kind; their punishment shall be, though just, yet less: but if the Children of Religious Parents after all Christian nurture shall shame their Education; <hi>God</hi> takes it more hainously and revenges it more sharply. The more bonds of duty, the more plagues of neglect. Again, if from the Agents we look to the act it self; set aside the Original descent, and what difference was there betwixt these fires? both look'd alike, heated alike, ascended alike, consumed alike: both were fed with the same material Wood, both vanish'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to smoak; there was no difference but the Commandement of <hi>God.</hi> If <hi>God</hi> had enjoyn'd ordinary fire, they had sinn'd to look for Celestial: now he commanded only the fire which he sent; they sinned in sending up Incense in that fire which he commanded not. It is a dangerous thing in the service of <hi>God</hi> to decline from his own institutions: we have to do with a power which is wise to prescribe his own Worship, just to require what he hath prescribed, powerful to revenge that which he hath not required.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. AFter many painful and perilous enterprizes, now is <hi>Moses</hi> drawing to his rest; he hath brought his <hi>Israelites</hi> from <hi>Egypt</hi> through the Sea and Wilderness, within the sight of their Promised Land, and now himself must take possession of that Land whereof <hi>Canaan</hi> was but a Type. When we have done that we come for, it is time for us to be gone. This Earth is made only for Action, not for Fruition: the services of Gods Children should be ill rewarded if they must stay here alwayes. Let no man think much that those are fetch'd away that are faithful to God, they should not change if it were not to their preferment. It is our folly that we would have good men live for ever, and account it a hard measure that they were. He that lends them to the World, owes them a better turn than this Earth can pay them. It were injurious to wish that goodness should hinder any man from Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. But what is this I hear? displeasure mix'd with love? and that to so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a servant as <hi>Moses?</hi> he must but see the Land of Promise, he shall not tread upon it; because he once long ago sinn'd in distrnsting. Death, though it were to him an entrance into glory, yet shall be also a chastisement of his Infidelity. How many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious services had <hi>Moses</hi> done to his Master? yet for one act of Distrust he must be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to his Fathers. All our obediences cannot bear out one sin against God; how vainly shall we hope to make amends to God for our former Trespasses by our better behaviour; when <hi>Moses</hi> hath this sin laid in his dish, after so many and worthy testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his fidelity; when we have forgotten our sins, yet God remembers them, and (although not in anger yet) calls for our Arrerages. Alass what shall become of them with which God hath ten thousand greater quarrels, that amongst many millions of sins have scattered some few acts of formal services. If <hi>Moses</hi> must dye the first death for one fault, how shall they escape the second for sinning alwayes? Even where God loves he will not wink at sin; and if he do not punish, yet he will chastise: how much less can it stand with that eternal Justice, to let wilful sinners escape Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 16. Moses</hi> that was so tender over the welfare of <hi>Israel</hi> in his life, would not slacken his care in Death. He takes no thought for himself, (for he knew how gainful an exchange he must make,) all his care was for his charge. Some envious natures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be missed when they must go; and wish that the weakness or want of a Successor may be the foil of their memory and honour. <hi>Moses</hi> is in a contrary disposition; it sufficeth him not to find contentment in his own happiness, unless he may have an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance that <hi>Israel</hi> shall prosper after him. Carnal minds are all for themselves, and make use of Government only for their own advantage; but good hearts look ever to the future good of the Church above their own, against their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 18. Moses</hi> did well to shew his good Affection to his people, but in his silence God would have provided for his own: he that call'd him from the sheep of <hi>Iethro,</hi> will not want a Governor for his chosen, to succeed him; God hath fitted him whom he will chose. Who can be more meet than he whose Name, whose Experience, whose Graces might supply, yea revive <hi>Moses</hi> to the people. He that searched the Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was fittest to guide <hi>Israel</hi> into it, he that was indued with the Spirit of God, was the fittest Deputy for God: but O the unsearcheable Counsel of the Almighty! aged <hi>Caleb</hi> and all the Princes of <hi>Israel</hi> are pass'd over, and <hi>Ioshua</hi> the servant of <hi>Moses</hi> is chosen to succeed his Master. The eye of God is not blinded either with Gifts, or with Blood, or with Beauty, or with strength; but as in his Eternal Election, so in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, he will have mercy on whom he will. And well doth <hi>Ioshua</hi> succeed <hi>Moses;</hi> the very acts of God of old were allegories: where the Law ends, there the Saviour begins; we may see the Land of Promise in the Law; only Jesus the Mediator of the New-Testament, can bring us into it. So was he a Servant of the Law, that he supplies
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:36907:91"/>
all the defects of Law to us: he hath taken possession of the Promised Land for us, he shall carry us from this Wilderness to our rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. I do not hear <hi>Moses</hi> repine at Gods choice, and grudg that this Scepter of his is not hereditary, but he willingly laies hands upon his Servant to consecrate hm for his Successor. <hi>Ioshua</hi> was a good man, yet he had some sparks of Envy: for when <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> Prophesied, he stomack'd it: he that would not abide two of the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> to Prophesie, how would he have allowed his Servant to sit in his Throne? What an example of meekness besides all the rest, doth he here see in this last act of his Master? who without all murmuring assigns his Chair of State to his Page. It is all one to a gracious heart, whom God will please to advance: Emulation and Discontentment are the affections of Carnal minds. Humility goes ever with Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; which teaches a man to think (what ever honour be put upon others) I have more than I am worthy of.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. ALl Sacrifices under the Law did as it were lead us by the hand to Christ, and point him out with the finger, who is the end of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. he is both the Altar and the Sacrifice; he is the <hi>Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world;</hi> as therefore these Lambs were offered in the morning and evening; so was Christ from the beginning of the World unto the end thereof; he is the Lamb slain from the beginning of the World, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. and as this daily Offering was twice perform'd, so we have daily need of Reconciliation, that his Blood should be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally applied unto us by Faith, and as we daily sin against him, so we must have daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course unto him for remission of sins. Again, this daily Sacrifice imports the daily Sacrifice of Prayer, which we ought to offer to God, as our daily service due unto him: and this for many Reasons. First, we have many sins. We provoke God every day, and therefore are taught in the Lords Prayer, daily to pray for <hi>Forgiveness.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, We have daily wants, and therefore it is our duty daily to bewail them, and daily to crave the supply of them, both temporal and spiritual blessings, for Body and Soul. Thirdly, We have daily dangers. Every Creature if God give us over, is able to work our destruction; therefore our only safety standeth in Prayer, and begging Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Fourthly, We have daily Temptations, Bodily and Ghostly, arising from the World, the Flesh, and the Devil; and therefore saith our Saviour, <hi>Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation, Mat.</hi> 26. So then this Morning and Evening Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice should direct us how and when to Worship God; we must remember him in the Morning and Evening, he must be the first and last in our thoughts, we must begin the day, and end it with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. Every day in the Week ought to be the Christians Sabbath, wherein he is to perform some duties or other of Religion; but every Seventh Day should be a double Sabbath, wholly taken up in the Service and Worship of God. When our whole work must be to beravish'd in Spirit; doing no Work but such as whereby we either bless <hi>God,</hi> or look to receive a Blessing from him; none but such as wherein we would the Lord should <hi>find us at his coming;</hi> which <hi>Lactantius</hi> saith, <hi>Will be on the Sabbath day.</hi> And therefore the Jews call'd the Sabbath, <hi>the Queen of dayes;</hi> blessing the Lord at its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in, and going out; that <hi>God</hi> might have both the first and the last Fruits of the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 26. Here is handled the Feast of Pentecost, or of Weeks, to give <hi>God</hi> thanks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the gathering of the Harvest. For in as much as <hi>God</hi> hath not only set us in this World, but supplies and feeds us in it, so that we live by his bounty and liberality; it was his will that the Jews should keep a yearly Feast to him, to give him thanks, that hereby they might acknowledg all the year after that they were sustain'd by his hand.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:36907:91"/>
Secondly, These first Fruits figured out Gods Church, which is a people separated unto him from the rest of the World. For as the first Fruits were separated from the rest of the heap unto God; so is the state of the Church call'd and cull'd out of the World unto his service.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. THis Feast of Trumpets was to be a Feast of remembrance of Gods mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold mercies received in the Wilderness, that thereby they might stir up themselves to be united to God; and may serve to stir us up to return unto God Praise and Thanksgiving with joyfulness of heart for all his benefits; according to that of <hi>Psalm 81. 1, 2. Make a joyful noise unto the God of Iacob. Take a Psalm, and bring hither the timbrel: blow up the Trumpet in the New-Moon:</hi> so <hi>David</hi> having expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Gods goodness towards him in many preservations, composed the eighteenth <hi>Psalm</hi> as a testimony of his thankfulness for his deliverance from his Enemies. And although this Feast is pass'd away and abolish'd by the coming of Christ, yet this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, that we <hi>our selves should serve for Trumpets.</hi> For as the Temple being destroyed, we must be spiritual Temples unto God; so the Trumpets being taken away, every one of us must be spiritual Trumpets, <hi>i. e.</hi> we should rouze up our selves from the World, and the vanities thereof. Our Ears are so possess'd with the sound of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and our Eyes so dazled with the pleasures of the flesh, that we are as deaf and blind men that can neither hear nor see what God saith unto us, wherefore we must not look till there be a solemn holy-day to call us unto the Church, there to keep a Feast of Trumpets, but it must serve us all the dayes of our life, as a spur to cause us to return to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. The Jews were here to afflict their Souls with voluntary sorrow for their sins for the whole year, and so dispose themselves to obtain pardon and reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For whereas in their private Sacrifices they durst not confess their capital sins for fear of Death due to them by the Law; God graciously provided and instituted this yearly Sacrifice of Atonement, and afflicting their Souls for the sins of the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without particular acknowledgment of any. After the same manner the Lords Supper is with us a day of Atonement, or afflicting of our Souls; for the Passover must be eaten with four hearbs. And further we may observe from hence, that this day of afflicting their Souls, was to be immediately before the Feast of Tabernacles, <hi>verse</hi> 12. they were to be kept in sorrow five dayes before they might keep their Feast of joy: which Feast signified the spiritual joy and gladness of the Saints, that are redeemed by Christ, all their life long. We must first look upon him whom we have pierc'd, and weep for him, before we can receive any comfort by him. We must afflict our Souls for his Passion, before we shall partake of the joy of his Resurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. This Feast was call'd the Feast of Tabernacles, because during the dayes of this Feast they were to live in Tents and Tabernacles; it being a memorial of Gods preserving them in the Wilderness, where was no house for them to rest in; and from hence we may learn, that it is a duty belonging to all to remember the dayes of their troubles, and afflictions, from which God in great mercy hath delivered us. We are ready to forget our former condition when God hath given us rest; and therefore God would have his own people year by year to depart out of their Houses, and dwell in Tents; that thereby they should call to mind both where they were, and where they had been; that although they now were at rest and ease in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet they had not alwayes been so; for God had carried them upon Eagles wings, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served them after a miraculous manner in the Wilderness.</p>

Who expects he should have kept touch with him; and accordingly will punish such a vow-breaker; for he hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not lyed unto men, but unto God, <hi>Acts 5. As God is true</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 1. 18. our word towards you was not yea and nay, but yea and Amen. For the Son of God, &amp;c.</hi> Why? what's all this to the purpose may some say? yes, very much. For it implies that what a Christian doth promise to men, (much more to God) he is bound by the earnest penny of Gods Spirit to perform; he dares no more alter and falsifie his word than the Spirit of God can lye. And as he looks that Gods promises should be made good to him, so he is careful to pay what he hath vowed to God; seeing Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is of mercy, ours of obedience; and if we expect that God should be all suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to us, we must be altogether faithful to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. The power and authority of the Husband over the Wife is very great: for all be it the Wife be at liberty to vow in the Lord when her Husband is dead, yet while he lives, he hath power to disanul her vows, <hi>The Husband is the head of the Wife, as Christ is the head of his Church, Eph.</hi> 5. to rule, to defend it, to provide for it; therefore as the Church is in subjection to Christ, so ought the Wife to be to her Husband. And therefore it is the duty of all Wives to acknowledg their duty, and to yeild without striving subjection to their Husbands. It is also the duty of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, seeing Authority is committed unto them over their Wives to love them ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, even as Christ loved his Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. It is his duty likewise to dwell with his Wife, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. and why to dwell together? but that the Husband should yeild to his Wife these four things: First, Good Example. Secondly, Instruction. Thirdly, Maintenance. And lastly, Imployment in her Calling for his good, and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. It is in our own power to vow or not to vow; but when we have vowed, it is not in our power to break it. <hi>Vovere nusquam est praeceptum</hi> (saith <hi>Bellarm. l. z. de Mona.)</hi> for as for that of the <hi>Psalm 76. 11. Vow, and perform to the Lord your God,</hi> is not <hi>Purum praeceptum,</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Cartwright,)</hi> a pure Precept; but like that in the New-Testament, <hi>Be angry and sin not;</hi> where anger is not-commanded, but limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. So neither are we simply commanded to vow; but having voluntarily vowed, we must not break it, nor yet may we defer to pay it. Delaies are taken for Denials, Excuses for Refusals. We must therefore come off with our vows roundly and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as those <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. 9. that had wings, and <hi>wind in their wings.</hi> Are not the nine Lepers condemned by Christ for their negligence and unthankfulness? <hi>Luke</hi> 17.

                  <hi>Verse 8. Balaam</hi> pretended an hast homeward, but he lingred so long that he left his bones in <hi>Midian.</hi> How justly did he perish by the Sword of <hi>Israel,</hi> whose tongue had insensibly slain so many thousands of them. As it is usually said of the Devil, that he goes away in a stench, so may it truly be said of this Prophet of his: according to the fashion of all Hypocrites, his words were good, his actions abominable; he would not Curse, but he would advise, and his Counsel is worse than a Curse; for his Curse had hurt none but himself, his Counsels cost the blood of four and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Israelites.</hi> He that had heard God speak by <hi>Balaam,</hi> would not look for the Devil in the same mouth; and if God himself had not witnessed against him, who could believe that the same tongue that uttered so Divine Prophesies, should utter so vilanous and cursed advice? Hypocrisie gains this of men, that it may do evil unsuspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: but now he that heard what he spake in <hi>Balaac's</hi> ear, hath berayed and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned his Counsel and himself.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. The Women were they that had caused <hi>Israel</hi> to sin, and therefore it was dangerous to save them, left they might entice <hi>Israel</hi> to sin the second time. If we would avoid the sin, we must have a care to fly the Temptation. If we would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the act of Uncleanness, we must not keep company with unclean persons; we must stand a loof, and keep at a distance from all occasions of sin. And therefore to pray <hi>Lead us not into temptation;</hi> and yet to run upon the occasion of sin, is to thrust our finger into the fire, and then pray that it may not be burnt: a good man dare not come neer the train, though he be far off the blow; he will not dare to play near the hole of the Asp, lest he slip into it. He will not dally with the Devil; knowing full well that sin is very infinuative; and that the old Serpent, if he once get in his head, will quickly wind in his whole body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. This policy was fetch'd from the bottom of Hell. It is not for lack of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that I (saith <hi>Balaam</hi> to <hi>Balaac,) Curse not Israel;</hi> thou dost not more wish their destruction than I do thy Wealth and Honour: but so long as they hold firm with God, there is no Sorcery against <hi>Iacob;</hi> withdraw God from them, and they shall fall alone, and Curse themselves; draw them into sin, and thou shalt withdraw God from them. There is no sin more plausible than Wantonness; one Fornication shall draw in another, and both shall fetch the anger of God after them. Send your fairest Women into their Tents, their sight shall draw them to Lust, their Lust to Folly, their Folly to Idolatry, and now God shall curse them for thee unask'd. Where <hi>Balaam</hi> spake well, there was never any Prophet spake more Divinely; where he spake ill there was never any Devil spake more desperately: ill Counsel seldom succeedeth not: Gods seed falls often out of the way, and roots not, but the Tares never likely miss.</p>

Then doth the Church and Common-Wealth flourish when these two go hand in hand; and on the other side, they go to wrack when they are separated, and draw several wayes.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 35. The greatness of the Victory that God gave his people here, appears by the distribution of the people, and reservation of the Women that had not known Man, which escaped the edg of the Sword. Learn hereby first, that the Iniquity of a People or Nation makes the Lord to destroy them, and lay them waste, sometimes by the Sword of the Enemy (as in this place) and sometimes by other Judgements. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the eyes of Gods providence are upon all men, and all their wayes, in that he destroies multitudes, and Nations, as well as single persons. Which may serve to reprove those that magnifie themselves against God; thinking to prevail and escape for their multitudes sake. Thirdly, This admonisheth every Country, City, and Nation, if they would enjoy their Lands and Goods in peace, they must seek to be at peace with God; and if they would not have destruction come upon them from God, let them not draw it upon themselves by their sins.</p>

There lacketh not one man of us,</hi> say they here, <hi>therefore we have brought an oblation.</hi> It was a great blessing of God to overcome the Enemy, and obtain the Victory; but thus to overcome, and to have such a Victory, required an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thanksgiving. As men ought to return thanks to God for all his blessings, so they ought for extraordinary Blessings to return extraordinary Thanks. As in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary visitations it is our duty to use extraordinary humiliation; so when God shews us extraordinary mercy, we must be thankful accordingly: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> return'd great thanks for his great Deliverance, <hi>Isai.</hi> 38. We must therefore consider what bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings we have received from God, that so we may render what thankfulness we owe him; else his Blessings will be turn'd into Curses, and his Mercies into Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

THis was an unseasonable demand of these Men at this time; but Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness had blinded their eyes that they could not see what was fit for them to ask; and therefore were afterwards the first of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> that were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away Captive, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 25. After the same manner it befel <hi>Lot,</hi> who looking after the goodness of the Plains of <hi>Sodom,</hi> more than the goodness of the People, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd that place in his choice, and was carried away Prisoner for it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. Thus God will not pass by the sins of his dearest Children without a sensible check. These <hi>Reube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> and <hi>Gadites</hi> for affecting the first choice, had soon enough of it. Strong affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions bring strong afflictions, as hard knots require hard wedges.

                  <hi>Verse 18. Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad</hi> were the first that had an Inheritance signed them, yet they must enjoy it last: so it falls out oft in the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> the first in title are last in possession. They had their lot assign'd them beyond <hi>Iordan;</hi> which though it were then in peace, must be purchas'd with their War: that must be done for their Brethren, which needed not be done for themselves: they must yet still fight, and fight foremost, that as they had the first Patrimony, they might endure the first encounter. I do not hear them say, this is our share, let us sit down and enjoy it quietly, fight who will for the rest: but when they knew their own Portion, they leave Wives and Children to take possession, and march arm'd before their Brethren till they have conquered all <hi>Canaan.</hi> Whether should we more commend their Courage, or their Charity? others were moved to fight with hope, they only with love: they could not win more, they might lose themselves; yet they will fight both for that they had something, and that their Brethren might have. Thankfulness and Love can do more with Gods Children than desire to merit, or necessity: no <hi>Israelite</hi> can, if he might choose, abide to sit still beyond <hi>Iordan,</hi> when all his Brethren are in the field.</p>

It is sad, when God is searching for our sins, if we are not searching for them too; and it is more sad, if when God comes to search for our sins, we be found hiding our sins. These are searching times, God is searching, let us search too; else we may be sure as <hi>Moses</hi> tells the people of <hi>Israel</hi> here, <hi>Our sins will find us out.</hi> They who endeavour not to find their sins, shall be found by their sins; our Iniquity will enquire after us, if we enquire not after it. But what if Iniquity enquire after us? What? if Iniquity enquire after us, it will find us, and if Iniquity find us, Trouble will find us; yea if Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity find us alone without Christ, Hell and Death will find us. If Iniquity find any man, he hath reason enough to say unto it, (what <hi>Ahab</hi> said to <hi>Eliah</hi> without reason) <hi>Hast thou found me O mine enemy?</hi> the best of men have reason to look out what

evill is in them, when God brings evil upon them, or wraps them up in common evils. They who have no wickedness in them to cast them under Condemnation, yet have sin enough in them to make them smart under Correction.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. THis is that place where the <hi>Israelites</hi> after three dayes journey found the bitter Waters. The long deferring of a good, though tedious, yet makes it the better when it comes. Well did the <hi>Israelites</hi> hope that the Waters which were so long in finding, would be precious when they were found. Yet behold they are cross'd not only in their desires, but their hopes; for after three dayes travel, the first Fountains they find are bitter Waters. If these Wels had not run pure Gall, they could not have so much complained. Long thirst will make bitter Waters sweet; yet such were these springs, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> did not so much like their moisture, as abhor their relish. I see the first handsel that God gives his People in their Voyage to the Land of Promise, is thirst and bitterness. Satan gives us pleasant entrances into his wayes, and reserves the bitterness to the end; God invites us to our worst at first, and sweetens our conclusion with pleasure. O my Saviour, thou didst drink a more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cup from the hands of thy Father, than that which thou refused'st of the Jews; or than that which I can drink from thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. God taught his People by actions as well as words. This entrance shewed them their whole Journey; wherein they should taste of much bitterness, but at last through the mercy of God sweetned with much more comfort, and for one Fountain of bitter Water, they should have no less than twelve of sweet. Or did it not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the <hi>Israelites</hi> rather in their Journey? in the Fountains of whose Hearts were the bitter Waters of manifold corruptions, yet their unsavory Souls are sweetned by the more abundant Graces of Gods Spirit. O blessed Saviour, that Fountain of Water and Blood which issued from thy side, that is, the application of thy Sufferings is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to sweeten a whole Sea of bitterness. I care not how unpleasant a portion I find in this Wilderness, if the power and benefit of thy precious Death may season it to my Soul.</p>

Among the several stations which the <hi>Israelites</hi> made through the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, one was <hi>Punon</hi> or <hi>Phinon,</hi> which as one of the antient Fathers observes, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth silence, or sparingness of Speech; upon which he maketh this useful Application; Let us be careful to take up our station here sometimes, while we are travailing through the Wilderness of this World.

THe Land of Promise was call'd <hi>Canaan</hi> of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cham,</hi> who with his posterity dwelt therein: and this is now bounded that they might inherit all that God had given them, and divide no more than was given them. This teacheth us that God sets bounds unto all mens possessions: they must take no more, nor usurp and presume any further than he hath given. Which condemns all encroaching and usurpation one upon another, in Kingdoms and Lordships, as well as private possessions; when men cannot be content with their own, but will stretch their power and jurisdiction further: God hath made them great, but they seek to make themselves greater; he hath set them bounds, but they will know no bounds. So that from hence we may gather, that the Wars which are taken in hand upon ambition, and enlarging of the bounds of their Empire only, are a despising of God, a shedding of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood, and a perverting of that order which he hath set in Nature, and Nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. The consideration of the nearness of Gods mercies should encourage and imbolden every one to be constant and couragious that we faint not in the last act; this made <hi>Moses</hi> say here, <hi>This is the land which ye shall inherit;</hi> he doth as it were point it out with the finger, and biddeth them lift up their Eyes, and behold the goodness which God had promised to their Fathers. For as the consideration of Judgement at hand, and lying at the doors, ought to move terror and astonishment, so when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the mercies of God before our eyes, which are not prolong'd for many years, it ought to enflame us with an holy zeal and desire to see the accomplishment of the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. Consider here the state of the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> as it now stood; and in this the state of Christs Church to the end of the World. Some were at rest, others were to pass further, some had their Inheritance, and some had none; some had Towns and Cities to dwell in, and some were yet left to the wide World, and were to wander further. Some had much, and others little or nothing at all: and the reason of this is, because God will never have those that have plenty and abundance to be without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, upon which to shew mercy; That his gifts may be tryed that he hath given them; as also to teach us that we should not settle our selves here, nor make the Earth our Heaven, but that we should seek for another life, where shall be no want, no misery, no necessity, but God shall be all in all.</p>

And that God expects these things of us, his own dealing Dictates; who when he did demand an allowance for himself to maintain his Priests and Levites withall; albeit they were one of the least Tribes, yet it was so much as in all probabilities did far exceed all other Tribes Revenues; and the same in such sort both for their own habitation, and for their Houshold provision and keeping of their Cattle for use and service about them, was as commodious and fit as to any of the rest. And that in very deed these things are not too much, the very Estate of the Ministers duly considered from reason will soon yield and confirm.</p>

And I would to God that this Age would but think upon this truth; and not think that all is well saved that is with-held from the Minister.

It is the duty of all Inferiors to Reverence their Superiors in gesture, in word and in deed; because Superiors bear the Image of God, and are to their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors in Gods place, as <hi>Moses</hi> was to <hi>Aaron,</hi> when God said, <hi>Exod. 4.

Every Daughter shall be a Wife unto one of the Family;</hi> which teacheth us, that however the marrying of many Wives was practised among the Patriarks, and people of God, yet this is the Law of Nature, that one man should have one Wife, and not Wives. But the main point we learn from hence, is, That the Inheritance of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> must remain and continue in one and the same Tribe. Now if it be the Ordinance of God that every man keep his proper Inheritance; then certainly distinction of Inheritance is agreeable to his Word. We are taught likewise from this
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:36907:95"/>
Text, that Parents should provide for their Daughters as well as Sons, and not to leave them to the wide World, especially in these our dayes, wherein more enquiry is made after what they have, than what they are, and what Goods are without them, than what good qualities are within. Nature teacheth, that if any Member be weak, it is chiefly to be strengthened; the Woman is the weaker, and therefore needeth to be supported.</p>

There may be sometimes an use of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, or going about again upon better light; but let not reasons be pretended, when they are not to satisfie our malice or revenge. For God seeth; and he being the God of peace, will ever shew his dislike of Quarrelling and Contention.</p>

If the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> had gone to <hi>Canaan</hi> without enquiry, their confidence had possessed it; now they send to espy the Land, sixty thousand of them never lived to see it: and yet I see God in <hi>Numbers</hi> 13. enjoyning them to send; but enjoyning it upon their instance. Some things God allows in Judgement; their importunity and distrust extorted from God this occasion of their overthrow. That which the Lord moves unto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers; but that which we move him to first, seldom succeedeth.

Now was <hi>Moses</hi> in danger of losing all the cost and care that ever he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon <hi>Israel:</hi> his people are already gone back to <hi>Egypt</hi> in their hearts, and their bodies are returning. O ye rebellious <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where shall God have you at last? Did ever <hi>Moses</hi> promise to bring you to a fruitful Land without Inhabitants? to give you a rich Country without resistance? are not the Graves of <hi>Canaan</hi> as good as those of <hi>Egypt?</hi> What can ye but dye at the hands of the <hi>Anakims?</hi> can ye hope for less from the <hi>Egyptians?</hi> is there less hope from the Enemies that shall be, when you go under strong and expert Leaders, than from the Enemies that were, when ye shall return masterless? feeble minds when they meet with Crosses they lookt not for, repent of their good beginnings, and wish any difficulty rather than that they find.

It had been happy for <hi>Israel,</hi> if <hi>Caleb's</hi> Counsel had been as effectual as good: but how easily have these Rulers discouraged a faint-hearted people. Instead of lifting up their Ensigns, and marching towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> they set them down and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. I fear if there had been ten <hi>Calebs</hi> to perswade, and but two faint Spies to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, those two Cowards would have prevailed against those ten Solicitors; how much more now ten oppose, and but two incourage. An easie Rhetorick draws us to the worse part; yea it is hard not to run down the Hill. The faction of evill is so much stronger in our nature than that of good, that every least motion prevails for the one, scarce any suit for the other.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 34. That God which was invisibly present whiles those <hi>Israelites</hi> sinn'd when they have sinn'd shews himself glorious and full of power. They did not believe before that he was able to bring them into that good Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> now they shall believe but never enter. They might have seen God before that they should not sin, now they cannot choose but see him in the height of their sin, unusually terrible, that they may with shame and horror confess him able to defend, able to revenge. The help of God useth to shew its self in extremity: he that can prevent evils, conceals his ayde till dangers be ripe; and then he is fearful, as before he seem'd connivent.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 37. What a weary life did <hi>Moses</hi> lead in these continual successions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies? What did he gain by his troublesome Government, but danger and despight? Who but he would not have wish'd himself rather with the sheep of <hi>Iethro,</hi> than with these Wolves of <hi>Israel?</hi> but as he durst not quit his Shepheards crook without the calling of God; so now he dare not his Scepter except he be dismiss'd of him that call'd him; no troubles, no oppositions can drive him from his place: we are too weak if we suffer men to chase us from that station where God hath set us. But what was this noted sin here that deserved Gods anger? <hi>Israel</hi> murmured for water. God bids <hi>Moses</hi> take the Rod in his hand, and speak to the Rock to give Water; <hi>Moses</hi> instead of speaking and striking the Rock with his voice, strikes it with his Rod: here was his sin an over-reaching of his Commission; a fearfulness and distrust of the effect. His Rod he knew was approved for miracles, he knew not how powerful his voice might be, therefore he did not speak but strike, and strike twice for failing. It is a dangerous thing in Divine matters to go beyond our warrant: those sins which seem trivial to men are hainous in the sight of God: Any thing that savours of infidelity displeaseth him more than some other crimes of morality. Yet the moving of the Rod was but a diverse thing from the moving of the Tongne, it was not contrary; he did not forbid the one, but he commanded the other: this was but across the stream, not against it; where shall they appear whose whole courses are quite contrary to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God?</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. IT is God that assigns every Man his Quarters here upon Earth, and cuts us out our several conditions, appointing the bounds of our habitation. This should make us rest contented with our own lot, and not murmur at other mens; though they be of the Seed of <hi>Esau;</hi> for they have a right to their Inheritance from God as well as we have for ours. Even the most Wicked have Earthly things given them by the Almighty, and therefore it is a rigour to say they are Usurpers. As when a King gives a Traytor his Life, he gives him Meat and Drink that may maintain his life; so it is with Wicked Men in respect of God; they shall not be call'd to an account at the Last Day for possessing what they had, but for abusing that possession. As for the Saints who are Heirs of the World with faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> and have a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being Heirs of this World and the next too; though here they be held to strait allowance, let them live upon Reversions; and consider that they have right to all, and shall one day have Rule of all. Wilt not thou rest content, unless God set down the Vessel to thee as to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> with all manner of Beasts of the Earth, and Fowls of the Ayre? must you needs have first and second Course? It is a very hard thing to have Earth and Heaven too. God did not turn you out of one Paradice, that you should here provide you of another. Earth is a place of bondage and banishment to all Gods Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. Money supplies all wants, and gives a satisfactory answer to whatsoever is desired or demanded; and although about Money there is much noise, and great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; yet Money answereth all, it effects all. What great designs did <hi>Philip</hi> bring to pass in <hi>Greece</hi> by his Gold? the very Oracles were said <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to say as <hi>Philip</hi> would have them. The Hebrew, or rather Chaldee word used for Money, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 27. signifies to do some great Work; because Money is the Monarch of the World; and therein bears most mastery. Among Suitors (in Love and Law especially) Money drives the business and bargain to an upshot.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 27.

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. THe Enemies of Gods Church are not consumed in a moment, but wasted and consumed by the providence of God by little and little. True it is, God is able to bring them all to nothing at once with the breath of his mouth; but it is his pleasure to waste and consume them by degrees one after another. As here after <hi>Sihon</hi> was overthrown, we see another Judgement of God upon another Enemy of the Church: and this God doth, because by them he may try the Faith, and exercise
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:36907:97"/>
the patience of his Servants. No marvel if others be oftentimes deceived in us, and are ignorant of the secrets of our Souls, seeing we our selves know not throughly our selves, untill we have ended and endured tryal. For such we are indeed as we are in the time of Temptation. Wherefore it is necessary that so long as we live in this World, we should be kept in a continual exercise of Faith, of Prayer, of Repentance, of obedience. This was likewise done to plague the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when at any time they should sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God: and therefore the Nations were left among them to be as snares in their paths, whips in their sides, and thorns in their eyes, because they transgress'd the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that God had made with their Fathers, <hi>Ps.</hi> 81. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. Among other means of working Faith in God, and resting our selves in his Promises, the blessed experience and comfortable proof which we have had of Gods mercies towards us in former times, is one of the chiefest to cause us to trust in him, and evermore to call upon him in our necessity. This is confirm'd unto us in <hi>Davids</hi> faithful behaviour, going to encounter with the uncircumcised <hi>Philistim, 1 Sam. 17. 34, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby it appears how the Prophet strengtheneth his Faith by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that he had in times past of Gods helping hand: nothing doubting but that the same God that had preserved him from the jaw of the Lyon, and the paw of the Bear, would keep him in this single Combate with that Champion that defied <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 26. Upon one single transgression God passeth the sentence of restraining <hi>Moses</hi> with the rest from the Promised Land; Now he performs it: Since that time <hi>Moses</hi> had many favours from God; all which could not reverse this decreed castiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that everlasting Rule is grounded upon the very Essence of God; <hi>I am Iehovah, I change not.</hi> Our purposes are as ourselves, fickle and uncertain; his are certain and immutable: some things which he reveals, he alters; nothing that he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 28 It is no small happiness to any State, when their Governors are chosen by Worthiness, and such Elections are ever from God; whereas the intrusions of Bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and unjust favour, and violence; as they make the Common-Wealth miserable, so they come from him which is the author of Confusion: woe be to that State that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it, woe be to that person that works it; for both of them have sold themselves, the one to servitude, the other to sin.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. SUch add to Gods Book as wrest it, and rack it; making it speak that which it never thought, causing it to go two miles, where it would go but one; knawing and tawing it to their own purposes; as the shooe-maker wretches the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Leather with his teeth. <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls <hi>Marcian</hi> the Heretick <hi>Mus Ponticus,</hi> from his arroding and knawing the Scripture to make it serviceable to his Errors. And too many of these kind of Mice have we at this day in this Nation, who wrest Texts of Conscience into Factions, Texts of Obedience into Rebellion; ravishing Scripture to force out Doctrines for their own ends, and then emptying their rancor by turning them to uses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. By Statutes here we may understand the Moral Law, by judgements the Judicial, which was fitted to the temper and disposition of the Jews: like as <hi>Solon</hi> being ask'd whether he had given the best Laws to the <hi>Athenians?</hi> answered, the best that they could suffer. And certain it is that <hi>Moses</hi> spake here (as ever) most Divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and like himself, or rather beyond himself; the end of a thing being better (if bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be) than the beginning of it; as good Wine is best at last, and as the Sun shines most aimiably when it is going down. This Book of the Law it was that the King was to write out with his own hand, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18. that it might serve as his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:36907:97"/>
Manual. This was that happy Book that good <hi>Iosiah</hi> lighting upon (after it had long lain hid in the Temple) melted into tears at the menaces thereof, and obtain'd of God to dye in peace, though he were slain in War. This only Book was that pretiously purling Current, out of which the Lord Jesus our Champion chose all those three smooth stones, wherein he prostrated the Goliah of Hell in that sharp encounter; <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. God would have <hi>Israel</hi> see, that they had not to do with some impotent Commander that is fain to publish his Laws without noise in dead Paper, which can more easily enjoyn than punish, to descry than execute, and therefore before he gives them a Law, he shews them that he can command Heaven, Earth, Fire, Aire, in revenge of the breach of that Law: that they could not but think it deadly to displease such a Law-giver, or violate such dreadful Statutes; that they might see all the Elements ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of that obedience which they should yeild unto their Maker. Now this fire wherein the Law was given, is still in it, and will never out. Hence are those terrors which it flashes in every Conscience that hath felt remorse of sin. Every Mans heart is a <hi>Sinah,</hi> and resembles to him both a Heaven and Hell. <hi>The sting of Death is Sin, and the strength of sin is the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. That they might see he could find out their closest sins, he delivers his Law in the light of fire; that they might see what is due to their sins, they see fire above to represent the fire that should be below them; that they might know he could waken their security, the thunder and lowder voice of God speaks to their hearts. That they might see what their Hearts should do, the Earth-quakes under them. O Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law, and mighty Law-giver. How could they think of having any other God that had such proofs of this? How could they think of making any resemblance of Him whom they saw could not be seen, and whom they saw, in not being seen, infinite? How could they think of disobeying his Deputies whom they saw so able to revenge? How could they think of killing, when they were half dead with the fear of him that could kill both Body and Soul? How could they think of the flames of Lust that saw such fires of vengeance. We Men that so fear the breach of Humane Laws for some small mulcts of Forfeiture, how should we fear thee O Lord, that canst cast Body and Soul into Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 24. If the Law as we read before was given in Thunder and Lightning, how shall it be requir'd; if such were the Proclamation of Gods Statutes, what shall the Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions be? O God, how powerful art thou to inflict vengeance upon sinners, who didst thus forbid Sin? and if thou wert so terrible a Law-giver, what a Judge shalt thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? what shall become of the breakers of so fiery a Law. O where shall those ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that are guilty of the transgressions of that Law, whose very delivery was little less than Death. If our God should exact his Law but in the same rigour wherein he gave it, sin could not quit the cost: but now the fire wherein it was delivered, was but terrifying, the fire wherein it shall be required, is consuming. Happy are those that are from under the terrors of the Law which was given in Fire, and in Fire shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 29. It is a kind of denying the Infiniteness of God to serve him by pieces, and raggs: God is not infinite to me if I think a discontinued service will serve him. It is a kind of denying the unity of God, to joyn other Gods, pleasure or profit with him; he is not one God to me if I joyn other Associates and Assistants to him. It is a kind of diffidence in Christ, as if I were not sure that he would stand in the favour of God stil, as though I were afraid that there might rise a new Favorite in Heaven, to whom it might concern me to apply my self, if I make the ballance so even as to serve God and <hi>Mammon:</hi> if I make a complemental visit of God at his House upon <hi>Sunday,</hi> and then plot with the other Faction, the World, the Flesh, and the Devil all the Week after.</p>

IT is not enough for us to Learn the Law, but we must keep it and do it; we must lay it up in our hearts as well as in our heads, and practice it also in our lives and Conversations. <hi>For not the hearers, but the doers of the Law shall be justified, Rom.</hi> 2. 13. Too too many in this Rotten Age wherein we live are Speakers, not Workers; as if <hi>Ostende re fidem,</hi> St. <hi>Iames</hi> his, <hi>Shew thy Faith by thy Works,</hi> were <hi>Ostendere</hi> to stretch the Jaws to shew our Faith by strong Protestations. But this must not be a work of the mouth, but hand: If a Man question thee of Faith, spare thy Lips, and let thy Life make answer. If words might be credited, if a bare profession of the Gospel might be believed; no Man would want Faith; every one would cry with the blind Man in the Gospel, <hi>Lord I believe;</hi> what Mouth would not make one Lye for its Master. <hi>Unless I see</hi> said <hi>Thomas</hi> of Christs rising; so unless I see and feel thy Faith, I will not believe. <hi>If we are good Trees, by our Fruit men shall know us, Mat.</hi> 7. By our Fruit; not by our blossoms of good purposes, or our leaves of good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, but by the Fruit of our actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. Parents are hence admonish'd to take heed of sinning against God, lest they be found unmerciful, unnatural, and hard hearted to their Children. Wicked Parents do what they can to make their Children miserable, even while they are projecting to make them great and happy. <hi>Tertullian</hi> treating of this point, supposeth that God aimed at this in giving the Law, when he threatned to <hi>punish the iniquity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon the Children, &amp;c.</hi> this saith he, God spake in reference to the hardness of their Hearts, that if no other argument would move them, to observe Gods Laws, yet meer compassion to their own Children might do it. All Parents have a natural love to their Children. So that they who have not a spiritual principle moving them to fore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bear sin, because they love God, and delight in his Law; may yet be moved by a principle of natural affection to avoid those sins; for which by Name God tells them he will surely afflict and punish their Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 22. God was ever wonderful in his Works, and fearful in his judgements, but he was never so terrible in the execution of his will as now in the promulgation of it. Here was nothing but a Majestical terror in the Eyes, in the Ears of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> as if <hi>God</hi> meant to shew them by this how fearful he could be. Here was the Lightning dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Eyes, the Thunders roaring in their Ears, the Trumpet of <hi>God</hi> drowning the Thunder-claps, the voice of <hi>God</hi> out-speaking the Trumpet of the Angel; the Cloud enwrapping, the Smoak ascending, the Fire flaming, the Mount trembling, <hi>Moses</hi> climbing and quaking, paleness and Death in the face of <hi>Israel,</hi> uproars in the Elements, and all the glory of Heaven turned into terror. In the destruction of the first World there were Clouds without fire. In the destruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> there was fire raining without Clouds; but here was Fire, Smoak, Clouds, Thunder, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, and whatsoevermight work more astonishment than ever was in any vengeance inflicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 26. The living <hi>God</hi> is an antient and usual Title of the Almighties, and, <hi>as I live</hi> is an usual Oath of <hi>Gods;</hi> neither do I remember any thing besides his Holiness, and his life that God swears by. When <hi>Moses</hi> ask'd Gods Name, he described himself by, <hi>I am.</hi> He is, he lives; and nothing is, nothing lives absolutely but he; All other things by participation from him. In all other things, their life and they are two; but God is his own life, and the life of <hi>God</hi> is no other than the living <hi>God:</hi> and because he is his own life, he is Eternal. For nothing ceases to be but by a separation of life; and nothing can be separated from its self; for every separation is a division of one thing from another: most justly therefore is he which is absolute, simple, eternal in his being, called the living <hi>God.</hi>

Be doing I say at every thing as well as at any thing, <hi>Fear God, and keep all his Commandements</hi> saith <hi>Moses</hi> here: thou must not be <hi>funambulus virtutum</hi> (as <hi>Tertullians</hi> phrase is) one that goes in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row tract of obedience; no, thy obedience must be universal extending to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the whole Law; and then <hi>Beati sunt qui praecepta faciunt, etiamsi non persici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt,</hi> saith St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> they are blessed that do what they can, though they cannot but underdo, that do what they can, though they cannot do as they ought. Fear God then, and keep all his Commandements; all of them to the utmost of thy power, and the assistance of Gods grace. The Book of <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> begins with <hi>All is vanity,</hi> and ends with <hi>Fear God, and keep his Commandements:</hi> that which troubleth us, <hi>Solomon</hi> calls vanity; that which is necessary he calls the fear of God. From that to this should be every Mans Pilgrimage in this World; we begin at Vanity, and never know perfectly that we are vain, till we come to fear God and keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. I observe here an excellent connexion betwixt the service required, and the reward promised. God hath no intent to be served by his Creatures for nought: if the service be but once hinted, <hi>Hear O Israel, and observe to do it;</hi> the reward is express'd in <hi>terminis, It shall be well with thee, and thou shalt encrease and multiply.</hi> Gods Precepts are still waited upon by Promises. Yea his precepts are but subservient to his Promises. God commands that he may promise, and would have obedience that he may perform blessedness to the Creature. It is true, there is nothing that man can bestow upon God, but might be exacted upon a bare Command; and yet God adds the Promise, when he presseth the Precept; and that he might win Man, he is fain to bait the Hook when he would catch the Fish, and to hang the Promise upon the Precept, that so Man might be made his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 5. God cannot abide that we should serve him with a double Heart, an heart and an heart, that is hypocritically. Neither that we should serve him with half an heart, that is niggardly and unwillingly; to serve God, and not with the whole heart is a base dodging with God. If the Heart were not Gods, it were too much to give him a part of it; but now that he made this whole heart of ours, it is but reason he should be served with all of it. Those serve God not with all the heart, whose bosom is like <hi>Rachels</hi> tent, that hath <hi>Teraphim,</hi> Idols hid in the Straw; or rather like a <hi>Philistines</hi> Temple, that hath the Ark and <hi>Dagon</hi> under one roof; those that have let down the World like the Spies into the bottom of the well of their heart, and cover the mouth of it with Wheat; I mean that hide great oppressions with smal Beneficences; those which like <hi>Solomons</hi> Curtizan cry <hi>Dividatur,</hi> and are willing to share themselves betwixt God and the World.</p>

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:36907:99"/>
seem Christians; and if they can get Gods livery on their backs, and his Name in their mouths, they out-face all reproofs. How many are there, who if they can keep their Church, give Alms, bow their Knee, say their Prayers, and once a year receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament think they may say in their heart, I have enough my Brother; but be not deceived, if long Devotions, sad looks, hard pen ances, bountiful Alms would have carried it without the solid substance of Religion, the Scribes and Pharisees had never been shut out of Heaven.</p>

VVE may be sure that whatsoever God hath promised to his Church, (and whatsoever God hath done upon the Enemies of his Church heretofore, those very performances to them, are promises to us of the like succors in the like distresses) he will perform, reperform, multiply performances thereof upon us. Therefore is God call'd here, <hi>The faithful God:</hi> for that faithfulness implies a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made before (and there enters his mercy that he would make that Covenant) and it implies also the assurance of the Performance thereof, and there enters his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. So he is call'd by St. <hi>Peter, 1 Pet. 4. a faithful Creator;</hi> he had an eternal gracious purpose upon us to Create us, and he hath faithfully accomplish'd it.

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. There is no Man but he hath more about him in his present engagements and obligations to God, than he will be able to answer in his best services, though he should live out his Eternity here; and then add a Christians Reversions to his present Possessions, and it may be read running, that God is not beholding to the Creature for any work or service that is done to him; and yet God is pleased here to promise these <hi>Israelites,</hi> that he will <hi>bless the fruit of their Womb, and the fruit of their Land, if they will hearken to his Iudgements, and keep his Commandements.</hi> But then withall, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve from hence, that God first hints the service, and then expresseth the reward. First, he saith in the fore-going Verse, <hi>If you will hearken to my judgements, and keep them;</hi> and then he grants the reward in this verse; <hi>I will bless the fruit of thy Womb, and of thy Land.</hi> God will stand upon his own Prerogative, and his Prerogative is to be served first and simply. Though God will not be served for nought, and therefore makes large Promises; yet he will not be served because of the Promise, but because of the Precept, and therefore that goes first. It is the Devil that makes bargains with his Servants to hire them to serve him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 9. but though God makes many and large promises to those that serve him, yet he never makes any bargains with them; and therefore in all the obedience that is done to God, the Christian must first eye the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and then the Promise. It is not denyed but I may look upon the Promise as a motive, as an encouragement, as an obligation, as an occasion to duty and obedience, but not as the end, and cause, and ground of my obedience. I may have <hi>respect unto the recompence of the reward</hi> with <hi>Moses, Heb.</hi> 11. 26. but to seek Christ because of the Loaves, is to respect the Loaves more than Christ, or as much as Christ, and that is rotten.</p>

For as without marrow in the bones, no part of Man, no not that which is of greatest value and force is able to do any thing; so the strength which Gods faithful Servants receive from him, is as Marrow which strengtheneth the Bones, and

maketh them apt to do good things. And as a Man that hath his bones fill'd with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and hath abundance of good blood, and fresh spirits in his body, he can endure to go with less cloaths than another, because he is well lin'd within; so it is with a heart that hath a great deal of the fear of God, he will go through difficulties, and troubles, and diseases, though outward comforts fail him.</p>

If it were no more, but in the service of the State, it is most odious and distastful. For a Captain to fight that he may divide the spoil, or for a Minister to comply with Covenants and Engagements that he may save his own, or creep higher, it is hist at by all honest Men; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much more to serve the great God for ends, is an abomination not to be named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians. It is Merchandizing with <hi>God,</hi> and not obedience to serve <hi>God,</hi> that I may serve my self.

For in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est extremity let him thus think with himself, it is <hi>God</hi> that smites me, can I resist his power? must I not obey his Will? Again <hi>God</hi> chastens me as a Father; he inflicts with grief, moderateth with Love, guideth with Fatherly providence what he orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth me to suffer; Shall I refuse Nurture, and shew my self a Bastard, and no Son? had I rather he should leave me to my self to follow my own courses, according to the

bent of my corrupt Nature, with a purpose to deprive me of his Glory, and dis-inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit me of his Kingdom?

Those sublunary Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures raise not distraction in us, so we make them not our Centre, if we rest not in them, if we can look through them to the giver; and therefore there is no doubt but we may entertain Riches not only as a Servant, but a Friend, but by no means as a Lord. There is vertue in the true use of them, if there be a qualification in our desires.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. THere was never so precious a Monument as the Tables written with Gods own hand. If we see but the stone which <hi>Iacobs</hi> head rested on; or on which the foot of Christ did once tread, we look upon it with more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry respect: with what eye should we have beheld this Stone, which was hewed and written with the finger of <hi>God.</hi> Any Manuscript scroll written by the hand of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Man, is layed up amongst our Jewels; what place then should we have given to the hand-writing of the Almighty? That which God hath Dictated to his Servants the Prophets, challengeth just Honour from us; How doth that deserve Veneration which his own hand wrote immediatly? Prophesies and Evangelical Discourses he hath written by others, never did he write any thing himself but these Tables of the Law; neither did he ever speak any thing audibly to all man-kind but it; the Hand, the Stone, the Law were all his. By how much more precious this Record was, by so much was the faolt greater of defacing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. God sends down <hi>Moses</hi> to remedy this sin: he could as easily have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented as redressed it. He knew <hi>Moses</hi> came up, what <hi>Israel</hi> would do ere he came down: like as he knew the Two Tables would be broken ere he gave them. <hi>God</hi> most wisely permits and ordains sin to his own ends, without our excuse. And though he could easily by his own hands remedy evils, yet he will do it by means, both ordinary, and subordinate. It is not for us to look for any immediate redress from God, when we have a <hi>Moses,</hi> by whom it may be wrought: since God himself expects this from Man, why should Man expect it from God.</p>

Now might <hi>Moses</hi> have found a time to have been even with <hi>Israel</hi> for all their unthankfulness, and mutinous Insurrections; <hi>Let me alone, I will consume them, and make thee a mighty Nation. Moses</hi> should not need to solicite God for Revenge, God solicites him in a sort for leave to revenge: who would look for such a word from God to Man, <hi>Let me alone?</hi> as yet <hi>Moses</hi> had said nothing; before he opens his mouth, God prevents his importunity, as fore-seeing that holy violence which the requests of <hi>Moses</hi> would offer to him. <hi>Moses</hi> stood trembling before the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

As I find it said afterwards of Christ, that he could do no miracles there, because of their unblief; so now I hear God, (as if he could

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. I see here that forty dayes talk with God cannot bereave a man of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate infirmity: he that was the meekest upon Earth, in a sudden indignation aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons that which in cold Blood he would have held faster than his Life. He forgets the Law written when he saw it broken; his zeal for God hath transported him from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his duty to the charge of God. He more hates the golden Calf wherein he saw engraven the Idolatry of <hi>Israel,</hi> than he honour'd the Tables of Stone, wherein God had engraven his Commandements; and more longed to deface the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol, than he cared to preserve the Tables. Yet that God which so sharply reveng'd the breach of one Law upon the <hi>Israelites,</hi> checks not <hi>Moses</hi> for breaking both the Tables of the Law. The Law of God is spiritual: the eternal breach of one Law is so hainous, that in comparison of it God scarce counts the breaking of the outward Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a breach of the Law. The goodness of God winks at the errors of honest zeal, and so loveth the strength of good affections, that it passeth over their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

God had promised <hi>Moses</hi> to make him a great Nation, <hi>Verse</hi> 14. but this satisfies not <hi>Moses,</hi> unless <hi>Israel</hi> may be so too; and therefore he prayes for them here, that the Lord would not destroy them. The more a man can leave himself behind him, and aspire to a care of community, the more spiritual he is: nothing makes a man so good a Patriot as Religion. But oh the sweet disposition of <hi>Moses</hi> fit for him that should be familiar with God! he saw they could be content to be happy and merry without him, he would not be hapyy without them. They had professed to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten him, he seeks to pray for them. He that will ever hope for good himself, must return good for evil unto others.</p>

Although <hi>Moses</hi> did here stamp and burn their Idol, yet I do not hear any of them say he is but one man, we are many, how easily may we destroy him, rather than he our God. It is our act, and we will maintain it; here was none of this but an humble obeisance to the basest revenge that <hi>Moses</hi> shall impose. God hath set such an impression of Majesty in the face of lawful Authority, that Wickedness is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in its self to behold it. Besides, sin hath a guiltiness in its self, that when it is seasonably checked, it pulls in his head, and seeks rather an hiding-place than a Fort.</p>

As God created the first Man after his own Image; but that once defaced, <hi>Adam</hi> begat <hi>Cain</hi> after his own; or as the first Temple rais'd, a second was built, yet so far short, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> wept at the sight of it. The first works of God are still the purest: those that he secondarily works decline in their perfection. It was reason that though God had forgotten <hi>Israel,</hi> they should still find they sinn'd.

When God had told <hi>Moses</hi> before, <hi>I will not go before Israel, but my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel shall lead them; Moses</hi> so noted the difference, that he rested not till God himself undertook their conduct: so might the <hi>Israelites</hi> have noted some remainders of offence, whiles instead of that which his own hand did formerly make, he saith now, <hi>Hew thee:</hi> and yet these second Tables are kept reverently in the Ark, when the others lay mouldred in shivers upon <hi>Sinah:</hi> like as the repaired Image of God in our Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, is preserved, prefected, and layed up at last safe in Heaven, whereas the first

Image of our created innocence is quite defaced: so the second Temple had the glory of Christs exhibition, though meaner in frame.

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. THis Element was not used to such Morsels. It devours the Carkasses of men, but bodies enform'd with living Souls never before. To have seen them struck dead upon the Earth had been fearful; but to see the Earth at once their Executioner and Grave, was more horrible. Neither the Sea nor the Earth are fit to give passage: the Sea is moist and flowing, and will not be divided for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it; the Earth is dry and massy, and will neither yeild naturally, nor meet again when it hath yeilded. Yet the Waters did cleave to give way unto <hi>Israel</hi> for their preservation; the Earth did cleave to give way to the Conspirators in Judgement: both Sea and Earth did shut their jaws again upon the Adversaries of God.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. Hence some <hi>Lutherans</hi> have concluded, that God hath not determined the set period of mans dayes; but that it is in Mans power to lengthen or shorten them, But is there not a time appointed for Man upon the Earth, <hi>Iob</hi> 7. 1. there is certainly. our bounds are prescribed us, and a pillar set by him who bears up the Heavens, which we are not to pass. <hi>Stat sua cuique dies,</hi> (saith the Heathen Poet) our last day stands though all the rest run. It is said of the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they shun not the company of those that have the Plague, but pointing to their fore-heads, say, it was writ there at their Birth when they should dye; and therefore <hi>Iob</hi> describing the shortness of mans Life, and withall, that <hi>his dayes are determined,</hi> compares them to the dayes of an <hi>hireling,</hi> For with an Hireling we agree to work with us for a certain time, and usually by the day, whence they are call'd Day-labourers. It imports then that the time of mans life is short, and set, for Hirelings are appointed to an hour. Fifteen years just, and no more were added to <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> life, <hi>Isai.</hi> 38. 5. our very hairs are numbred, much more then our dayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. What ever the <hi>Egyptians</hi> fancy of their River <hi>Nilus,</hi> both their River, and our Rain too are from above; there is not any of the Creature, not so much as our meer Water, but we receive it from Heaven. <hi>God bottleth up the rain</hi> saith <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>pours it on the earth,</hi> when God pleaseth to turn the mouths of these bottles down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. This is a great miracle, that whereas Water is fluid, and beareth downward, yet now that God thus binds up these heavy vapours, and keeps them in those Vessels of the Clouds as thin or thinner than the liquor that is contain'd in them (as a strong Man in a Cobweb) till brought by the Winds wheresoever he pleaseth, they drop up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth by little and little to make it fruitful; this is a wonderful work of God, and should bring us to the knowledg of his Power, Wisdom, and Goodness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. We read in natural story of some Creatures, <hi>Qui solo oculorum aspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu fovent ova, Plin. l. 10. c.</hi> 9. which hatch their Eggs only by looking upon them. What cannot the Eye of God produce and hatch in us. The Eye of the Lord upon me makes midnight noon, and St. <hi>Lucies</hi> St. <hi>Barnabies</hi> day, and the Winter's the Summers Solstice; what a chearful Spring, what a fruitful Autumn hath that Soul that hath the eye of the Lord alwayes upon her? The eye of the Lord sanctifies, nay more than sanctifies, glorifies all the Ecclipses of dishonour, makes Melancholy Chearfulness, Difidence Assurance, and turns the jealousie of the sad Soul into Insallibility. Upon the people of <hi>Israel</hi> Gods eye shined in the Wilderness, his eye singled them in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in <hi>Babylon</hi> they were sustained by his Eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. Fathers should look upon their Children as Gods heritage, and labour to make them Sons of God, and Heirs of Heaven; they must desire and endeavour to become natural as well as spiritual Fathers to their Children, by teaching and instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from their very Infancy. For when Children are able to learn any thing that's bad, then certainly it is high time to teach them something that's good; when they can stammer out an Oath, or lisp towards blasphemy, then it is high time to teach them their Catechism, and instruct them in the Principles of Religion. And therefore the Holy Ghost hath composed certain <hi>Abcedarian Psalms,</hi> according to the order of the Hebrew Alphabet; that Children might learn an Alphabet of Godliness, and Parents teach them the Elements of Religion as well as of Learning; such Psalms are 25. 34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. THe difference between Divinity and other Sciences, is; that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to learn, but we must observe and do it: as lessons of Musick must be practised; and a Copy not read only, but writ and followed. The practical Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is the best Christian, <hi>Man goeth forth to his work and to his labour till the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> saith the <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 23. he must ever more be doing, following his honest imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in his particular place and calling, whether Manual or Mental, eating his Bread either in the sweat of his brow, or his brain. And as it is with Man in his Civil, so likewise in his Spiritual Calling; he must arise from the bed of sin, and go forth out of himself, out of his Lusts and sinful affections, as out of his House, to his work and to his labour, working out his salvation with fear and trembling, untill the Evening, till the Sun of his Life be set.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. There is no one duty almost in both Testaments, more press'd than this of rejoycing before the Lord, and the contrary is complain'd of, and sorely threatned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 47. and therefore it is declared here as a recompence of all their charge and pains, <hi>Ye shall feast before the Lord with joy,</hi> this was the sweet-meats of the Feast; other dainty dishes there might be, but this was the Banquet. This made those good Souls, <hi>Ps.</hi> 84. 7. go bodily on from strength to strength; though they took many a step, yet their comfort was, that they should everyone of them <hi>in Syon appear before the Lord,</hi> and then thought their pains, though never so great, well bestow'd; though they then saw Gods face but obscurely in the dark glass of the Ceremonies. What then should not we suffer to see God clearly in his Ordinances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. The words are not, you shall not do ill in your own Eyes, but <hi>you shall not do that which seemeth good;</hi> good I say, and I pray you mark it, you shall not do that, but shall keep you to my Commandement. Be it never so good then in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that is, be my meaning never so good, it will not excuse. The time will come saith Christ, <hi>that whosoever killeth you will think that he doth God good service.</hi> What then shall his so thinking excuse his bloody murther? What ill meant <hi>Ioshua</hi> when he wish'd <hi>Moses</hi> to forbid those that Prophesied? <hi>Micha's</hi> Mother, when according to her Vow she made her Sons two Idols? the Disciples of Christ when they forbad Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children to come unto him? <hi>Peter</hi>'s meaning had no hurt in it, when he bad Christ to pitty himself, and when he forbad him to wash his feet, yet you know no good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was accepted in these cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. God will not take any of thy pretended Superogations for Sacrifices or Worshipping, but will be served after his own way, and according to his own Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and therefore he saith in the former Verse, <hi>Take heed that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest;</hi> as if he had said, I will be worshipped ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which I have commanded thee, and not after thine own fancy. Because indeed that God (the very reason and cause of all things) hath his end in all whatever he ordains. For to direct all Nations to the Sacrifice of his only Son alone, he would have but one Temple, but one Sanctuary, and one Altar; whereas thou dost darken and confound his meaning by thy multitude of High Places and Altars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 32. God accepts of no service but such as he commands. <hi>You shall not do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that which seems right in his own eyes,</hi> saith the Holy Ghost in the beginning of this Chapter; but ye shall do whatsoever I enjoyn you, saith the same Spirit in this Verse. Our service is limited to that which God liketh. <hi>Saul</hi> thought that Sacrifice had been service, but God liked better of his obedience. <hi>Uzza</hi> supposed he had done but his duty in holding up the Ark which was like to fall, but God taught him that it was far otherwise. The Scribes and Pharisees thought themselves the only men that served God, because of their long Praying, much Fasting, <hi>&amp;c. But who required these things at their hands?</hi> said Christ.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. WHat <hi>Moses</hi> speaks of false Prophets, may be spoken of all bewitching sins with pleasure or profit: <hi>If a Dreamer of Dreams have given thee a sign, and that sign come to pass;</hi> if a sin have told thee it will make thee rich, and it hath made thee rich; if this Dreamer draw thee to another god, if this profit draw thee to an Idolatrous, <hi>i. e.</hi> to an habitual love of that sin, (for <hi>Tot habemus recentes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os quot vitia,</hi> saith St. <hi>Ierome)</hi> yet though this Dreamer be thy Brother, thy Son, how near, how dear, how necessary soever this sin be unto thee, <hi>Non misereberis,</hi> saith <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Thine eye shall not pitty that Dreamer, &amp;c.</hi> and so of this pleasurable or profitable Sin, <hi>Non misereberis,</hi> thou shalt not hide it, but pour it out in confession; <hi>Non misere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beris,</hi> thou shalt not pardon it, no nor reprieve it, but destroy it for the practise pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently; not <hi>Misereberis,</hi> thou shalt not turn out the Mother and retain the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not leave the sin, and retain that which was sinfully got, but divest all, root, and body, and Fruits, by confessing to God, by contrition in thy self, by restitution to men damnified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. As the Spider in the midst of her Cobweb feeling the least touch that shakes her work, retires instantly from the danger; so should the perfect Convert shrink at the least noise, whispering and murmuring of a Temptation, he should avoid the very Complement, and first Address of the Devil, and the very sight, the discourse, the aire and breathing of his instruments. It is not safe to hear them, or hold Discourse with them; lest they insinuate and infect us as the <hi>Montanists</hi> did <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Acasius</hi> the Heretick did <hi>Anastasius</hi> a Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who sought to rectifie him. For such mens words are softer and smoother than Oyl, and yet in the end prove <hi>sharper than drawn swords,</hi> saith the Psalmist; they pretend healing and Cordials in their Discourse, when the poison of Asps is under their Lips; Heaven and Salvation is in their mouth, when nothing but Hell and Destruction in their Heart. They are like Eagles, that sore aloft towards Heaven, not for any love of Heaven, but that they may spy their Prey the sooner, and seize upon it the better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. We must relye upon, and praise, and bless God alone. For can we relye upon Man? upon what Man? upon Princes? we have seen them unking'd, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man'd too, both their Crowns and their Lives taken from them. Wilt thou relye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on great Persons in favour with Princes? have we not seen often that the Bed-Chamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Kings have back doorsinto Prisons, and that the end of that Greatness hath been but to have a greater Jury to condemn them? Wilt thou relye upon the Prophet, he can teach thee; or upon thy Brother, he does love thee; or upon thy Son, he should love thee; or the Wife of thy bosome, she will say she loves thee; or upon thy Friend, he is as thine own Soul? yet <hi>Moses</hi> here puts a case, when <hi>thou must depart from all these,</hi> not consent, no not conceal; not pardon, no not reprieve, <hi>Thou shalt surely kill him,</hi> saith <hi>Moses,</hi> even this Prophet, this Brother, this Son, this Wife, may incline thee to the service of other gods; that Prophet by what Name or Title soever he be call'd; that Brother how willingly soever he divide the Inheritance with thee; that Son how dutiful soever in civil things; that Wife, how careful soever for her own honour, and thy Children; that Friend, how free soever of his favours, and of his secrets, that inclines thee to other gods, or to other service of the true God then is true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. Men must be swift to hear, slow to speak, that is, to censure and pass sentence. <hi>Athanasius</hi> passeth for a Sacrilegious person, a prophane wretch, a bloody Persecuter, a blasphemer of God, and was so condemn'd before he was heard by that <hi>Pseudosynodus Sardicensis;</hi> and therefore God doth command the <hi>Israelites</hi> here that they should enquire diligently, before the Judgement should pass upon the offenders, even in such matters as concern'd his own Worship; he would not have so much as that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:36907:103"/>
preserved from Idolatry without strict enquiry, and search <hi>whether the thing was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that such an abomination was wrought among them.</hi> A rash precipitant course in matters of Judgement hath saved many a guilty person, and condemned as many inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Follow therefore Gods method, enquire before you Judge, know the cause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you pass the sentence.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. FRom hence we may observe how careful the Lord is, not to have his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple imitate the fashions of the Gentiles, for fear one thing should draw on another, and in the end, even Idolatry and false Worship. We in these dayes are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to Forrein Fashions, the Lord in mercy save us from forrein sins, oppression, tyranny, and Massacrees, and continue his Gospel and Peace upon us, preventing and confounding their designs, that craftily endeavour the supplanting both of Church and State under the colour of policy and safety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. The people of the Jews were an holy people unto God with a federal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, which yet without an inherent holiness in the heart and life, will profit a man no more then <hi>Dives</hi> in the flames that <hi>Abraham</hi> call'd him Son, or <hi>Iudas</hi> that Christ call'd him Friend; an empty title yeelds but an empty comfort at last. Let us therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour an inward holiness, to bear his mark, his Seal, his Covevant upon our heart: then shall we be indeed (as it is in the Text) <hi>a chosen Generation,</hi> a pickt people, the dearly Beloved of Gods Soul; such as first he chose for his love, and then loves for his choice; we shall be his peculiar people, his people of purchase (as it is in the Septuagint) such as comprehend as it were all Gods gettings, his whole stock that he makes any great reckoning of; and upon the same account we are said to <hi>be Kings and Priests unto God;</hi> First Kings, to rule in Righteousness, to Lord it over our Lusts, to triumph over all our spiritual Adversaries, <hi>being more than Conquerors through him that loved us, and laid down his lise for us, that we might reign and live eternally.</hi> And surely if Kings are doubly bound to serve God, both as Men and Kings; what are we for this spiritual Kingdom? Secondly Priests, to offer up to him the personal Sacrifice of our selves, the verbal of Praise, and real of Alms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. There was never any surer evidence of the cleanness of a Creature among the Jews, then that it was permitted to be Sacrificed, or to be kill'd and eaten; the Lamb and the Turtle emblems of Innocence, and Charity, and other Christian Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, were daily slaughtered and devoured; while the Swine, and all the uncleaner Creatures were denyed that favour, placed under a kind of <hi>Anathema,</hi> or excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication-sentence, of such it was not lawful no not to eat: and thus it must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in the Antitype, that all the heat of the Satanical impression, all the fire of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious zeal, the fatal sentence to be Sacrificed and devoted, should fall upon Lamb-like Dove-like Christians; it being constautly the portion and the prerogative of the best Men to be under the Cross, to have their <hi>hundred-fold of good things in this world with persecutions, Mark</hi> 10. 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. When <hi>Moses</hi> sheweth here what Fowls are unclean; you may note the great mercy of God, in that most of these unclean Fowls are indeed odious to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and we eat them not; whereas he might have restrain'd his People from those that they loved and liked; so good is God in all things, and careful not to lay heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens upon us. Some good Fowls are yet restrain'd, that Men might learn Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and obedience, for Gluttony and excess we are very prone unto. Some have considered the nature of every Fowl, and laboured from that to learn something for amendment; as for instance, by the Eagle that mounteth high, they have noted mounting aspiring minds to be a fault, and to make Men unclean. By the Goss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauk, Men that prey upon their weaker Brethren and Neighbours, and gripe them
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:36907:103"/>
so as they kill them and undo them. By the Vulture, Men that delight too much in Wars and Contention; and so of the rest. But in the general, you must even take it so that God stood not so much upon these Ceremonies, as to teach his people hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward truth, and cleanness of heart, ever fit for such as are Gods people: at this therefore we must carefully aim to be holy as God is holy.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. EVery Seventh Day the Jews rested from their labours; every Seventh Year the Ground rested; and every Seventh Seventh was the Jubilean Sabbath; at which all Debts were remitted, Prisoners released, Morgages restored to the right Inheritors. The great and eternal Sabbath comprehends all these; that is, the Year of Grace, that blessed Jubilee, wherein all true <hi>Israelites,</hi> all the faithful people of God shall be discharg'd from all their engagements, as well of sin, as for sin: God shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us all our Debts, all our Trespasses; how much more then should we forgive those that trespass against us. For Judgement without mercy shall be to them that shew no mercy; there's but an hairs bredth betwixt him and Hell, that hath not his sins pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Heaven, such is the case of every one that doth not forgive his offending Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 35. or that saith, I will forgive the fault, but not forget the matter, or affect the person; men must forbear one another, and forgive one another as Christ forgave them; and that if any man have a quarrel against any, for else what thanks is it? the glory of a Man is to pass by an infirmity. It is more comfortable to love a Friend, but more honourable to love an Enemy; if thou reserve in thy mind any piece of the wrong, thou provokest and daily pressest God to reserve for thee a piece of his wrath, which burneth as low as the nethermost Hell. Neither will it help any to do as <hi>Latimer</hi> reports of some in his dayes; who being not willing to forgive their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, would not say their <hi>Pater Noster</hi> at all; but instead thereof took our Ladies-Psalter in hand: because they were perswaded, that by that they might obtain forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their sins of favour, without putting in of so hard a condition as the forgiveness of their Enemies into the bargain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. Those that are without the Covenant are also without the mercy of God; Christ will never pardon those for whom he never died; their sins only shall be blotted out of Gods Book, whose Names are written in it. Christ is the covering or propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his peoples sins, be they never so many, and never so great; as was sweetly shadowed of old by the Ark covering the Law, the Mercy-seat covering the Ark, and the Cherubims over them, both covering one another, in allusion whereunto, <hi>Blessed</hi> (saith <hi>David) is the man whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered, Psalm</hi> 32. 1, 2. But then you must remember that all this covering of this Law, and this Mercy-seat, and these Cherubims had relation unto the people of God, (which were then the Jews,) no other Nation had any of these types; and as the types did not, so neither did the Antitype belong to them: our Saviour was no covering to their sins, no discharger of their Debts: they were all of the number of these <hi>Forreiners</hi> in the Text; they were at the Creditors mercy to be cast into Prison, and from thence not to depart till they had paid the utmost farthing. But now there is no exacting from them, no Condemnation <hi>to them that are in Christ Iesus,</hi> saith <hi>St. Paul, Rom. 8. 1. Non una Condemnatio,</hi> not one Condemnation. There it none in Heaven, God doth not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them; none on Earth, their own hearts and conscience doth not condemn them; no Word, no Commandement, no Threatning. But now an unbeliever shall have a double Condemnation; one from the Law which he hath transgressed, another from the Gospel which he hath despised: as a Malefactor, that is Condemn'd and dead in Law, despiseth and rejects his Princes pardon. But now it is quite otherwise with those that are in Christ Jesus: the Law cannot condemn them, because they have appeal'd; the Gospel cannot, because they have believ'd.</p>

The Poor are here call'd <hi>Our poor,</hi> as well as <hi>Our Brethren;</hi> to shew that our compassion and love should be as ready for them, as for our nearest Relations; and <hi>these Poor</hi> saith this Text, <hi>shall never cease out of the Land,</hi> to try and exercise our libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, yea our Justice, as the <hi>Syriack</hi> calls it, for our Alms are due unto the Poor, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Law of Equity, or of charity. For there is a debt of Love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. that we must be ever owing, and ever pay; and as we say of thanks, thanks must be still given, and still held as due, so must this debt of Love. <hi>Quicquid Clerici habent, pauperum est</hi> (said <hi>St. Ierome)</hi> which is true in a sence of others as well as Ministers, the Poor (Gods Poor and our Poor such as are Aged and impotent) are the owners of that we have, we are but Stewards and dispensers of Gods bounty to his necessitous ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: now if our Receits be found great, and our layings out small, God will cast such Bills back in our faces, and turn us out of our Stewardship: they are fools that fear to loose their Wealth by giving, but fear not to loose themselves by keeping it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 21. Whatever Beast was offered up and sacrificed to the Lord, must <hi>be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemish, neither lame nor blind</hi> (saith the Text.) And certainly if the Sacrifice were to be without blemish, much more is the Priest; who was stil'd holy to the Lord from a two-fold holiness, the one of his Life, the other of his Person. For all Sanctity is not inward, nor is all perfection, that of the Soul. Gods holy one must be his fair one too, without blemish, no less in body than in mind. Thus under the Law no monstrous issue, no blind seer might offer the bread of his God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21. and shall the Evangelical ministration be worse served than the legal; while the Sacrifice is more noble shall the Priest be less? only the fattest in the Heard, the fairest in the Flock were the oblations of the Law, and shall the poorest of the Tribe, the most deformed of all the issue be the Offerings of the Gospel? the Lords house is no Hospital; neither the Sacrifice nor the Priest must be admitted unsound and imperfect.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 16. LEst Men should altogether neglect the service of God, here is an injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given from the Lord, that all the Males should go up to the Temple three times a year, still to keep them in use and love of the Church; albeit they dwelled a great way off. Where you may observe, that although the Law reach'd but to the Males, (because God graciously considered that the Women might be with Child, or Nurses, and not able to come;) yet godly Women when they were able, and had no impediment, would go up also with their Husbands; such a zeal had they to the House of God. So went up <hi>Hannah</hi> with her Husband; so went up the Blessed Virgin to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> every year, at the Feast of the Passover; both of them when there were gross and foul Corruptions. For when <hi>Hannah</hi> went up, what read we of the Sons of <hi>Heli?</hi> and when <hi>Mary</hi> went up, the Scribes and Pharisees were in their Ruffe; yet they went up to teach us not to fall out with God for Mens faults, nor to absent our selves from Church and Church exercises; because all things are not perfect in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. Gifts and Rewards put out the Eyes of those that saw clearly before, and stop the Ears of those that could hear before, and shutteth up the mouth of those that could speak before. If then the receiving of Bribes, and taking of Gifts be a setting of Justice to sail; if they have force to pervert and corrupt not only such as are lewd and lime-finger'd to draw Presents unto themselves, but the wise and righteous; then we must acknowledg them to be dangerous Temptations; this <hi>Moses</hi> teacheth the Judges and Officers which were to be chosen in their Cities; <hi>Thou shalt not wrest the Law, &amp;c.</hi> neither let them say, though I take Rewards, I will never swerve from Justice, for that is to presume vainly of thine own strength, and to give the Spirit of God the lye that speaketh the contrary. Now seeing that Gifts and Rewards offered be as baits laid up to ensnare the Soul, let us refuse them in the first place; and next let us follow
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:36907:104"/>
after the best Gifts, which may further the Salvation of the Soul. Those indeed are good Gifts which make the possessors of them better, and which in the day of trouble and hour of Temptation, shall minister more true comfort and peace than all earthly and transitory things, which end in corruption.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. IT is the duty of a Child of God to fear the Judgements of God. We should fear the Judgements of God whilst threatned, and only heard of: what though we see them not? what though we feel them not? what though we are not the persons intended in them, or to be smitted by them? yet the report of them as directed against others, should make us tremble. Now if we are to fear God for his Judgements when they are but threatned, then certainly we are to fear him much more for his Judgements inflicted. And therefore in the old Law here when Judgements were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, 'tis said, <hi>they shall hear and fear, and do no more presumptuously;</hi> they shall fear what had been already executed upon offenders, and so fear to offend. <hi>Moses</hi> here sheweth what all ought to do, not what all did upon the appearances of Judgement, and the execution of Divine wrath upon high Transgressors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 17. Here the King is commanded not to multiply Wives: and that upon very good ground: for if one Woman undid all Man-kind, what marvel is it if many Women may undo one. And Satan hath found this bait to take so well, that he never chang'd it since he crept into Paradice. How many have we known whose heads have been broken with their own Ribs. In the first World the Sons of God saw the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Men, and took them Wives of all that they liked; they multiplyed, not Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but Iniquities: <hi>Balaam</hi> knew well if the Dames of <hi>Moab</hi> could make the <hi>Israel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> Wantons, they should soon make them Idolaters: all lies open where the Covenant is not both made with the Eye, and kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse 20. Learn to fear the Lord,</hi> (saith the Holy Ghost in the former Verse) <hi>that thy heart be not lifted up above thy Brethren.</hi> The best counterpoison against Pride is to get the heart seasoned with the fear of God; for <hi>the fear of the Lord is to hate evill, as Pride, Arrogancy, Prov. 8. 13. Ioseph</hi> truly fear'd God, and therefore hated not only gross Evils (as Adultery) but close Evils, as Pride and Arrogancy; <hi>It is not in me, God shall give Pharaoh an answer, Gen.</hi> 41. as he insinuates himself by this dutiful comprecation, so he extenuates his gifts, that he may give the glory to God. So <hi>St. Iohn Baptist</hi> was full of the fear of the Lord, and thereby of Humility. For these two go coupled, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 4. and so close, that there is no Copulative in the Original; for thus it runs in the Hebrew, <hi>By humility the fear of the Lord are riches, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and life.</hi> What Riches the Baptist had I know not; but for honour, that hand of his that he thought not worthy to unloose the latchet of Christs shooe, Christ thought worthy to be laid on his head in Baptism. There are that say, that for his humility here on Earth, <hi>St. Iohn</hi> is dignified with that place in Heaven from which <hi>Lucifer</hi> fell; who told them that I know not; but this I know, <hi>that he that humbleth himself shall be exalted, Luke</hi> 4. 11.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. YOu have here in this Verse the reason wherefore Tythes ought to be paid to Gods Ministers. We must give to God, what? the things of God; why? because they are Gods, they do properly belong unto him as his own possession; they are a peculiar Inheritance, or special portion reserved to himself. So that although he hath given the Earth to the Sons of Men; yet these like a chief Rent to a Landlord, or a certain Tribute to a King, were alwaies excepted and reserved; they were the Lords Inheritance: and when men began wickedly to alienate the same, and usurp upon his sacred Right, then his re-claim and re-seizure thereof condemns the usurpers of down-right theft, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. Is it so then that these things are Gods; it is therefore but equity to pay them to God: for equity requireth, and Justice biddeth, that we give to every one his own: on the other side to with-hold them, or to take them, or any part of them from God is injury, because so the right owner is wrong'd; more, seeing the owner of these things is not man, but God; it is impiety, yea it is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, the highest and the horriblest sin in that kind that can be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. Christ as a Prophet teacheth spiritually, and powerfully: spiritually; the Word and the Spirit go both together: the word is but a dead letter in its self fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Spirit goes along with it, according to that of <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 63. If the Spirit goes with the Word, then the Word proves Spirit and Life: the Spirit worketh freely in the Preaching of the Gospel, the Word is but an instrument in the hand of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by which it works. Then Secondly, Christ as a Prophet teacheth powerfully; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gospel is call'd <hi>The power of God unto salvation,</hi> and he is said, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. to teach as one having Authority: his word had a commanding power and authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Spirits. Whensoever Christ comes to preach to thy Soul, he will come with power; he will make a separation between thy soul and thy sins, he will pluck thee off from thy base lusts, and cursed practises, as once he did <hi>Paul:</hi> and so will Christ deal with thy Soul, who ever thou art that cleavest as close to thy sins as thy skin to thy flesh, he will fetch thee off from those by his powerful Preaching.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 4. ALl sins then are not equall, neither are all to be alike punish'd, as by <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi>'s Laws they were in a manner; which Laws are said to be writ not with Ink, but blood, because they punish'd every <hi>Peccadillo</hi> almost with blood. There are difference in sins, and must be so in their punishments. He that hates his Neighbour, and smites him that he dyes, <hi>thine eye shall not pitty him, verse</hi> 13. let him dye without mercy, let no man mediate for him, lest he draw upon the Land guilt of Blood, and hinder the Man-slayer from Repentance. But in case a Man kill his Neighbour igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, here is a City of refuge to fly unto that he may live. And here in an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical sence, Christ is our City of Refuge, to whom if we fly when we are pursued by the guilt of an evill Conscience, we shall live; none can take us out of his hands: if we be in Christ the Rock, Temptations and Oppositions, as Waves, dash upon us, but break themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. How hainous a sin this is, appears by this strict prohibition given by God himself, back'd with a Curse, Chap. 27. and that Curse seconded with a Woe by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah.</hi> A vice so injurious, that it was odious to the Heathen; and therefore the <hi>Romans</hi> condemned the meaner sort who were guilty of it to the Mettal houses, and banish'd the better sort with the loss of the third part of their Estates: so that I cannot

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. To blame then are those that proceed upon every idle surmize, suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or report; and here it is further to be noted, that three manner of persons can make no credible Witness or Information. First, Adversaries; for evill will doth never speak well. Secondly, Ignorant men, and those without judgement: for he must be both a wise man, and an honest man that ought to be a Witness: for else if he be a wise man, and not an honest man, he is a Knave; and again, if he be an honest man, and no wise man, he may be a fool; and therefore he is to be both wise and honest that is to be a Witness. Thirdly, whisperers and blowers in mens ears, that will spue out in hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-mugger more than they dare a vow openly. To all such we must turn the deaf Ear, the Tale-bearer, and the Tale-hearer are both of them abominable to God, <hi>Psalm</hi> 15. what matter therefore soever is established, must be established at the mouth of two or three Witnesses that are both honest and wise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 20. They shall fear with a reverential fear, from which will spring sincere service, <hi>Aliorum perditio tua sit cautio,</hi> let other Mens destruction be your Caution, which is in the Psalmist expression to wash our feet in the Blood of the Wicked, <hi>Psalm</hi> 59. 10. when the Righteous seeing the ruine of the Wicked, shall become more Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And certainly worthily are they made examples that will not take them. The fearful judgements that fall upon others, should be a terror to us. It is a just presage and desert of ruine not to be warn'd.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. ALl the Lords Souldiers that fight his Battels, and inroll their Names in his Muster-book, must be men of stout courage, and valiant men at Arms, as they that go about a good Work; he receiveth none into his Camp that are faint-hearted, which are not able to encourage themselves, but discourage others. Hence it is that the Lord charg'd the Heralds at Arms to make Proclamation in the audience of the people; <hi>Whosoever is afraid and faint-hearted, &amp;c.</hi> God would have Wars made in his Name, and therefore he would have Souldiers go to them without fear. If a man be afraid, it is a sign he hath no trust in God, for he hath power to overcome fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. This serves to reprove all those, who wanting the vertue of Valour, and this gift of magnanimity, do betray themselves, and yeild to most unequal conditions, and make an agreement upon dishonourable termes. When <hi>Benhadad</hi> the King of <hi>Aram</hi> laid siege to <hi>Samaria,</hi> and sent unto <hi>Ahab,</hi> saying, <hi>Thy silver and thy gold is mine, Ahab</hi> stooped and submitted himself unto him, saying, <hi>My Lord, according as thou hast said, I am thine.</hi> But our trust and confidence must be in God, and then we shall not fear what man can do unto us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. The people of God may lawfully make Wars both offensive and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive against their enemies. Thus when <hi>Amalek</hi> fought with the people of God in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phidim, Moses</hi> said to <hi>Ioshua, Chuse us out men, and go sight Amalek,</hi> so he discomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Amalek</hi> and his people with the edg of the Sword. Many other testimonies might be brought, and many other examples alledg'd, to teach us that it is lawful to gather an Hoast, to put on Armour, to guird our selves with the Sword, and to joyn in Battel with our Enemies. Those then that are call'd to be Souldiers, must learn from hence, not to be feeble and faint-hearted, but to be bold as in the work of the Lord. True Religion doth not weaken the hearts of Men, and make them Cowards. For first it teacheth and informeth the Conscience, that the cause of the War is good, just, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:36907:106"/>
by the Word of God; without which knowledge in the heart, how ugly, how foul, how cruel a thing is the effusion and shedding of Blood? Secondly, as true Religion establisheth the Conscience touching the lawfulness of War, so it teacheth them to commit themselves and their lives into the hands of God as to a faithful keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to be perswaded if they Conquer, they conquer to the Lord; if they be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and fall, they fall and dye unto the Lord.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 6. THe Jews were much used to outward Washings, and vainly imagined that those were sufficient to cleanse them throughout. And here the washing of their hands over the Heifer, was as much as to say, the guilt of innocent Blood doth no more stick to my Conscience, than the filth now washed off doth to my fingers. But what Pharisaical washing is this to purifie the hands, and pollute the heart; <hi>O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>Ier. 4. And cleanse your hands you sinners,</hi> was the Apostles Exhortation, <hi>Iames</hi> 4. but withall, <hi>Purifie your he arts ye double-minded;</hi> and this for many reasons; For First, God and Nature ever begin at the heart; it is the first thing that lives, and the last that dyes, and therefore it is the first the Devil gives assault to, and the last that he gives over. Secondly, Were there never a Devil, the heart hath an ill Spirit of its own to trouble it, and had we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hands, eyes, nor feet, our hearts would find the way to Hell, and therefore there is great reason we should look to purge and cleanse that: for if this Spring, this Fountain be clean, the streams that flow from it will be so too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. Secular Learning is not so Heathenish, but it may be made Christian, as this Captive in the Text was not such an Infidel, but she might become a Convert and part of the <hi>Israel</hi> of God. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> are not of such a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate sence as to stand wholly excommunicate in the Christian Church. For <hi>Aristotles Metaphysicks</hi> may help to convince an Atheist of a God, and his <hi>Demonstrations</hi> prove <hi>Shiloes</hi> advent to a Jew. And therefore though (it is true) the Scripture was ever the Levites predominant Element, yet if you will make him a perfect mixt body, the Arts also are to be necessary Ingredients. And upon this account, when <hi>Adrian</hi> the sixth, in his Tract <hi>De vera Philosophia,</hi> cries down humane Learning with a noise of <hi>Fathers,</hi> yet he concludes, <hi>Utilem esse scientiam Gentilium, dummodo in usum Christianum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertatur,</hi> that to shave and pare the captive Woman, and then Espouse her, was ever held lawful Matrimony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 13. The Wicked Mans Wine is best at first, the good Mans at last: the Devil deals by the one as <hi>Iael</hi> by <hi>Sifera,</hi> speaks them fair at first till he hath lull'd them a sleep in security, and then he involves them in misery. But God doth by his Children as the Hebrew was to do by the captive Woman in this Text, which he had a desire to Marry: at first he appointeth us a time of Mourning, but afterwards he vouchsafes us the fruition of himself in glory. The freshest Rivers of Carnal Pleasure shall end in a salt Sea of despairing Tears; whereas the wettest Seed-time of a pious Life, shall end in the Sun-shining Harvest of a peaceful Death. In a word, the Transgressor, how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant soever his beginnings be, his last end shall be dolorous; but the upright how troublesome soever his Life be, his death shall be joyous, <hi>For the end of that man is peace, Psalm</hi> 37.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. IF thou must not suffer thy Brothers Ox or his Ass to go astray, much less maist thou suffer his Soul; but thou must endeavour in all Christian wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and meekness to reduce it from the dangerous precipeces both of sin and error. Thou must pull thy Brother out of Hell, as the Angel pull'd <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as ye would save a drowning man, though ye pull'd off some of his hair to save him. Neither must we of the Gospel be merciful only to our Brother, but also to our Enemy. This is an hard task you will say, but hard or not hard, it must be done, be it never so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our foul nature. We must seal up our love to our Enemies by all good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, which are to be referr'd to these three heads. First, We must bless them, speak kindly to them, and of them, they must have our good word. Secondly, We must do good to them, <hi>i. e.</hi> be ready to help and relieve them upon all occasions. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, We must pray for them, that God would pardon their sins, and turn their hearts. This was our Saviours precept <hi>(to love our Enemies)</hi> and the same also was his practice. He melted over <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (the slaughter-house of himself and his Saints) and was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the hardness of their hearts. Next (for Words,) he prayed, <hi>Father forgive them:</hi> and for deeds, he not only not call'd fire from Heaven, or Legions of Angels against them; but did them all good for Bodies and Souls; for he heal'd <hi>Malchus</hi> ear, wash'd <hi>Iudas</hi> his feet: like that good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> he was at pains and cost with them. Now if we would be Christs Disciples, we must follow his example; do good not to our Brethren only, but also to our very Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. This and the following Verses forbid all mixture and Toleration in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we must keep our selves to one God, and serve him, and none with him. If <hi>Baal be God, follow him</hi> (saith <hi>Eliah,</hi> 1 King. 18.) <hi>and if the Lord be God, follow him; how long will ye hault between two Opinions?</hi> It is a foul-imperfection to hault, yet more shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful long to hault, most of all between two wayes, and miss them both. To be inconstant in Civil matters, which are in their own Nature inconstant, is weakness. But in Religion, which is alwaies constant, and one and the same to be unsetled, is the greatest folly in the World; for he that is not assured of one Religion, is sure to be saved by none. And there fore it is very strange to me that in this glorious light of the Gospel now among us (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we so much boast of) we should see so many Bats flying, which a Man cannot tell what to make of, whether Birds or Mice. These are <hi>Plantanimals,</hi> like the wonderful sheep in <hi>Muscovy, Epicens;</hi> they are <hi>Amphibia animalia,</hi> Creatures that sometimes live in the Waters, sometimes on the Land; Monsters bred of unlawful conjunctions which should not see the Sun. Now if the Image of this vice be so horrid &amp; odious in Nature, what shal we judge of the vice its self in Religion? I am sure that God can away with any sort of sinners better than these: for these he threatneth to spew out of his mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16. as we therefore tender the Salvation of Body and Soul, let us take heed of this plowing with an Ox and an Ass in the Text of this <hi>Laodicean</hi> temper in Religion: if we ever look to be saved by our Religion, we must save and preserve it entire and unmixt: for God is a jealous God, and will not give any part of his glory to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. Upon these Fringes was some parcel of the Law written, that so looking upon them, they might be put in mind of Gods Commandements, which should teach us, that all sorts both young and old, of what condition soever are enjoyn'd to know the Doctrine of the Scriptures, and the will of God reveal'd in them; and this because ignorance is the ground of error, <hi>The natural man perceiveth not the things that be of God:</hi> so then being of our selves blind, and wanting the light of the Word, we must needs go astray; hence it is that Christ saith to the Sadduces, <hi>Ye err not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Mat.</hi> 22. and then again, the want of Knowledg is the cause of sundry fearful judgements, Spiritual and Temporal, inward and outward; for as Ignorance is the cause of sin, so it is the cause of judgement the reward of sin. If we care not to know God,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:36907:107"/>
but neglect the meanes of Knowledge, no marvel if we be punish'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. God will not suffer his Children to be evill-spoken of unjustly; but will both clear them from the scandal, and punish it. God will so Oyl their good Name, that infamy shall not stick on it. Dirt will stick upon a Mud-wall, but not upon Marble: and therefore say, thou be aspers'd and denigrated by the Calumnies and contumelies of black Tongues, and thou lye under them for a time as the Earth doth under the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Night; yet as the morning suddenly arrising driveth away that darkness, so God shall clear up thy wronged innocency; and as the Moon wadeth out of a cloud, so shalt thou get out of all thy troubles in this kind, or any other. It shall be with thee as it was once with <hi>Cato,</hi> (whom <hi>Seneca</hi> calls the lively Picture of Vertue) who was two and thirty times openly accused in Court, and as many times cleared and absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7. THe relation of Flesh and Blood should be a strong tye among Christians, and all Men indeed; but we find the quite contrary. For the difference of Brethren are of all others most irreconcileable; whether they be Brethren by Race, or Grace. And for the first of these, see it exemplified in <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Abel, Esau</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob:</hi> for thus it is written in nature, that those that loved most dearly (if once the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil cast his Club between them) they hate most deadly; and as for Brethren by Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (and that of the true Religion too) you shall meet with many divisions, and those prosecuted with a great deal of bitterness. No War breaks out sooner, or lasts longer than that among Divines, or about the Sacrament; a Sacrament of Love, a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet the occasion by accident of much dissention. Great care therefore must be taken that Brethren break not Friendship, or if they do, that they unite and peece a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as soon as possible, for remember (saith the Text) <hi>he is thy Brother,</hi> and therefore to be born with, though unkind and injurious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. Seeing War is a lawful Ordinance of God, it teacheth us to use it lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to behave our selves uprightly when we go unto it. So soon as War is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, and the Trumpet sounded, all Laws for the most part keep silence, and equity is buried; there is no mean or measure observed; every Man thinks he may do what he list. Hence it is that the Lord giveth these Precepts to his People, <hi>When thou goest out with an host against thine Enemies, &amp;c.</hi> Where <hi>Moses</hi> teacheth, that we must not bear our selves in War, as if all things were lawful, nor give our selves a lawless liberty to be carried head-long into all Wickedness: when we are come into the Field, and there stand against the Enemy, we must not think we have a pardon purchased to fall into all outrage and villany. For whose are the Battels that we fight? who is it that giveth the Victory? If we look for any blessing from God, we must have the more care to serve him faithfully, and depend upon him religiously. Prophane and ungodly men must not be listed in his Army. The Lord will be the greatest Enemy unto such, and they have more cause to stand in fear of him, than of all their Enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 14. Seeing God is ever in his Church, it is our duty to behave our selves in all our actions, as in his presence. It behooveth us to set him alwayes before us, and to know how that he continually walks among us. If the Child were alwayes in the sight of his Father, the servant of his Master, the Subject of his Prince, they would not have an unseemly gesture, a disordered action; how much more doth it stand us upon to look to all our wayes that we offend not before the Majesty of God, in whose presence we stand. When the Minister Prayes and Preacheth, when the people attend and hearken, we must know that God looks upon us. This is that use which <hi>Moses</hi> sets down here in giving directions to the people, that they <hi>should have a place without the hoast, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:36907:107"/>
the truth of which Ceremony leads us as it did them to a further matter, and teacheth us that we must be an holy people to God in soul and body, and to take heed of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our selves with sin; we must all of us learn to purge our selves from such foul and filthy Corruptions, if we will have God to rule and be resident among us.</p>

He that sacrificeth a Lamb as if he cut off a Doggs neck.</hi> Others take it metaphorically, of impudently shameless sinners, that blush not to commit Uncleanness in the sight of the Sun: these shall never enter into Gods House, the Kingdom of Heaven. The <hi>Irish</hi> ayr will sooner brook a Toad or Snake to live there; than Heaven will brook a sinner. It was not permitted to a Dogg to enter into the <hi>Acropolis,</hi> (which was the chief Tower or Temple at <hi>Athens)</hi> for his heat in Venery, and ill savour, saith <hi>Plutarch.</hi> Goats likewise saith <hi>Varro,</hi> come not there; unless for Sacrifice once a year; upon the same account no filthy Doggs, or nasty Goats shall ever enter into Heavens Tower. The <hi>Panther</hi> smells well among Beasts (whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by she draweth about her) not so among Men. God and the Saints loath what the Wicked love and delight in; as the <hi>Panther</hi> doth in mans excrements.</p>

There is no policy in a sudden removal of just punishment. If the judgement had been at once inflicted and removed, there had been no example of terror to others: unless the Rain so fall that it lie and soak into the Earth it profits nothing. If the judgements of God should be only as Passengers, and not So journers at least, they would be no whit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 15. The hireling hath earnest thoughts upon his Reward; his Reward is in his Eye, which is the reason here given why his Wages should not be with-held: poor Man he hath been working all day, and he hath had his heart upon his Wages, the hopes of that gave him some relief and ease in going through his hard task and service, therefore thou shalt not keep it from him. But is not this a Sin in the Servant to set his heart upon his Wages; is not the charge given, <hi>Psalm 62. If riches encrease, set not thine heart upon them;</hi> there is a great difference between these two Texts. For this word here notes the lifting up of the Soul, so we read in the Margin of our Bibles, but in the Psalm (where he speaks of the Covetous rich Man) the word imports the setting down or setling of his heart upon it. A poor Man hath but a little, and his Wages it may be is above him; his Wages possibly is more than he is worth; therefore he lifteth up his mind to it, as a thing he reacheth upward for; but a Rich man who hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance let's his heart down, he croucheth and broodeth upon the Creature. A godly poor man looks up to his Reward, and fetches his Bread from Heaven; a covetous Rich man looks down to his Reward, and takes his Bread from the Earth. A godly man is above all earthly things, and yet he lifts up his mind to receive them; a meer natural Man is below earthly things, and yet he descends that he may receive them. The things which both receive are the same, but the conveyance and the derivation differ alwayes as much as Heaven and Earth, sometimes as much as Heaven and Hell.</p>

I answer, That outward temporal evils are in the nature sometimes of a Curse, sometimes of a Cure, and accordingly God deals. For sometimes he punisheth a bad Father in a bad Son, and then it is not a cross only, but a Curse to both; so God punish'd <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his first-born. Sometimes he punisheth a good Father in a good Son, and then it is, though a cross, yet a cure to both; so

punish'd he <hi>David</hi> in his young Child. Sometimes he punisheth a good Father in a bad Son, as he did <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Absolom,</hi> and then 'tis a cure to the Father, but a curse to the Son: sometimes he punisheth a bad Father in a good Son, thus he punish'd <hi>Ieroboam</hi> in his Son, and then it is a curse to the Father, but a cure to the Son.</p>

IN the <hi>Israelites</hi> passage out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> God would not lead them the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way by the Philistines Land, lest they should repent at the sight of War; now they both see and feel it. God knows how to make the fittest choice of the times of evill; and with-holds that one while which he sends another, not without a just reason why he sends and with-holds it. And though to us they come ever as we think unseasonably, and at some times more unfitly than others; yet he that sends them knows their opportunities. Who would not have thought a worse time could not have been pick'd for <hi>Israels</hi> War than now; in the feebleness of their Troops when they were weary, thirsty, unweaponed; yet now must the <hi>Amalekites</hi> do that which before the <hi>Philistines</hi> might not do; we are not worthy, not able to choose for our selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18. How cowardly and how craftily was the skirmish of <hi>Amalek!</hi> they do not bid them battle in terms of War, but without noise or warning come stealing upon the hindmost, and fall upon the weak and scattered Remnants of <hi>Israel.</hi> There is no looking for favour at the hands of malice: the worst that either force or frand can do, must be expected of an Adversary; but much more of our spiritual Enemy, by how much his hatred is deeper. Behold this <hi>Amalek</hi> lies in ambush to hinder our passage into our Land of Promise, and subtilly takes all advantages of our weaknesses. We cannot be wise or safe if we stay behind our Colours; and strengthen not those parts where is most opposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 19. God holds it no derogation from his Mercy to bear a Quarrel long where he hates: he whose anger to the vessels of Wrath is everlasting, even in temporal judgement revengeth late: the sins of his own Children are no sooner done, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, then forgotten; but the malicious sins of his Enemies stick fast in an infinite displeasure: it is not in the power of Time to raze out any of the Arrerages of God: we may lay up wrath for our Posterity: happy is that Child therefore whose Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors are in Heaven, he is left an inheritor of Blessing, together with Estate, whereas wicked Ancestors loose the thank of a rich Patrimony, by the Curse that attends it. He that thinks because punishment is deferr'd, that God hath forgiven, or forgot his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, is unacquainted with Justice, and knows not that Times makes no difference in Eternity.</p>

How he liketh such dealings, his Law will teach us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in oftentimes he requireth that his Offerings be of the best without blemish. Add to this the solemn protestation which God required here at every Mans hands, what time he made his account. <hi>When thou hast made an end of Tything</hi> (saith God) <hi>Verse</hi> 12. then thou shalt say, <hi>I have not eat thereof in my mourning for any necessity whatsoever, nor suffered ought to perish by putting it to any prophane usage, or carelesly testing it to be spoil'd, but have hearkened to the voice of the Lord my God, and done after all that thou in this case hast commanded me.

Between these two are contained all the labours and undertakings of this people; by their going forth is meant the beginning of their labours, and by their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in is meant the end and conclusion of their labours; so that beginning and ending when they set their hands to a business, and when they took their hands from a business, they should be blessed, that is, they should have a through blessing upon all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.

Wherefore it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that as God repeats the same again, so we should read and meditate of it again and again, that it may powerfully perswade us to be wise, and take time while time serves, to turn unto the Lord, while his arm is stretched out to receive us. This Verse also, and indeed the whole Chapter may assure us that sin will have plagues first or last; and therefore when they happen, complain of sin and not of God; remembring that there is no reason at all that we should grieve that God that will not hear us, when we our selves will not hear God. Or why sigh we, that God will not look down to the Earth, when we our selves will not look up to Heaven. We can despise his precepts, and yet we think much that he should despise our Prayers. We beat our Servants if they offend us, being but men as they are; and may not God then beat us for our faults, he being our Creator, and we but dust. Thus make use of these Curses, and instead of them, God ever give us for Christs sake his blessings both Temporal and Eternal, both of this World, and also of that better to come.</p>

The fear of the Heart and the sight of the Eye, are near adjoyned.

Unlesse sorrow be hid from the Eyes, it can hardly be kept from the Heart. It is an usuall custome, if a man be but let bloud, to bid him turn away his head if he be faint-hearted, for the sight of his bloud will make his heart faint; and so from more gashly spectacles, men commonly turn away their faces, which is to keep sorrow from their sorrow, and so from their Hearts.</p>

Thus <hi>Moses</hi> speakes here, of the many signes and wonders which God wrought in the midst of that People, which they did not understand. Why, what was the reason? <hi>Moses</hi> tels us expresly, The Lord had not given them an heart to conceive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They had sensitive Eyes and Ears, yea, they had a rational heart, or mind, but they wanted a spirituall Eye to see, a spiritual Ear to hear, a spiritual Heart to apprehend and improve those wonderful works of God; and these they had not, because God had not given them such Eyes, Ears, and Hearts. Wonders without Grace cannot open the Eyes fully, but Grace without wonders can: And as man hath not an Eye to see the wonderful works of God spiritually, until it is given, so much lesse hath he an Eye to see the wonders of the Word of God till it be given him from above.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 12. This hath been the practise of Gods Children in Scripture, to consecrate themselves to God by Vow or Covenant, Thus <hi>Moses</hi> here, after he had given the Law to the People, causeth them to enter into Covenant for the performance of it: Nor is it without singular reason that godly men have taken this course, that hereby they might be the more strongly obliged to God, and God to them. There is indeed a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient obligation in Gods Precepts, to require our obedience, but when to his Precepts we add our own Promise, it is so much the more engaging. True it is, the Creatures na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Obligation to his Creators Command is so great, that in its self it is not capable of addition, but yet our voluntary Promises serve to inflame our Luke-warmnesse,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:36907:110"/>
and stir up our backwardnesse to obedience. Indeed a religious resolution is as the putting of a new rowel into a spurre, which maketh it the sharper, the twisting of another thred into the rope, whereby it is the stronger: And hence it is that as God in condescention to our weakness, hath annexed an oath to his Promises, not to make them firmer in themselves, but to confirme us the more; So godly men in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own dulness, adjoyn their Promises to Gods Precepts, not to strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their force in enjoyning, but to quicken themselves the more in observing.</p>

Nothing is more bitter then sin, and therefore compared here to gall and wormwood; <hi>Lest there be among you any root that beareth gall, &amp; wormwood, i. e.</hi> least any person among you should commit this wickednesse, (namely Idolatry) which will be as distastefull to God as gall is to man, and which will be as bitter as gall to the man who commits it, whether we consider the bitternesse of repentance if it be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or the bitternesse of paine if he (persisting in it impenitently) be punished.</p>

When secret things are revealed unto us of God, we ought to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to learn them, to understand them, to publish them, and speak of them to others. Whensoever God hath a mouth to speak, we must have an ear to hear. Therefore <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>Secret things belong to the Lord, but the things revealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto us &amp; to our children:</hi> Which may serve to reprove all such as refuse to look into these revealed things of God, but dwel in blindnesse and ignorance: Of this sort are the greatest number of Christians, they are wise enough to look into their own profit, but they care not for the wisdome that is of God, they are brought up in the Church, but know not the Doctrine of the Church; whereas, being brought up in the Schoole of Christ they must every day be profiting and going forward.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. At what time soever man repents of his sins from the bottom of his heart, at that very time God will repent of the judgment he intended against that man: And thus here, when Gods People should be carried away captive into any strange Land, if then in their captivity they would turn unto God, God would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately turn unto them; For, the only reason why God doth not repent of the evil of punishment, is because we do not repent of the evil of sinne, the onely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why God delayes to turn away his wrath, is because we delay to turn unto him. We cry, <hi>How long Lord, how long, when wilt thou have mercy upon England?</hi> and God calls, <hi>How long, O England, how long, when will you turn unto me with all your heart, when will it once be?</hi> Jer. 13. I appeal to your consciences that read this, is it fit God should cease fighting against you by the sword, before you cease fighting against him by your sins, but if ye would turn unto God, let me assure you, the very same day that you turn, God will turn; You have Scripture for it. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 18. nay let me tell you, the very minute that you begin to repent, God will repent, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 7, 8. <hi>At what instant I shall say to a nation,</hi> &amp;c. as a personal repentance is a meanes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a personal salvation, so a national repentance is a meanes to obtain a national

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. The Decrees of God are not all of them absolute, but many of them conditional; <hi>If thou wilt hearken unto the Lord thy God and keep his Commandments</hi> saith the Text, <hi>then the Lord will blesse thee, and rejoyce over thee for good,</hi> &amp;c. And though this condition be not alwaies exprest, yet it is to be understood of course, there are some Promises absolutely exprest in Scripture, but yet made upon condition, and so to be understood; as some threatnings are made upon condition of impenitency, so are some promises upon condition of obedience; <hi>Yet fourty dayes and Nineveh shall be destroyed,</hi> Jonah 3. 4. the Threatning seems to be absolute, and definite, yet to be understood with this reserve, unlesse <hi>Nineveh</hi> repent. So for Promises, though Gods decree concerning <hi>Elies</hi> house, seemed to be most absolute, <hi>I said indeed that thy house should walk before me for ever,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. yet that God intends a condition is most plain, because God adds the condition, <hi>verse</hi> 30. of that <hi>Chapter,</hi> so that you see whether God doth threaten a Judgement, or promise a Mercy to his People, all is upon Condition; that is the steer, the rudder, that guides all.</p>

In the mean space, how should we every day take a turn or two with Christ upon mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> get up to the top of <hi>Pisgath</hi> with <hi>Moses,</hi> and take a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of heaven; turn every solemnity into a schoole of Divinity, say as one said, when he heard a good consort of musick, what musick may we think there is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 2. WE heard before the sin of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> speaking unadvisedly with their lips, and striking the rock doubtfully with their hands, and therefore the Lord doth here punish <hi>Moses,</hi> and deny him enterance into the promised Land, <hi>Thou shalt not go over Iordan,</hi> from which we are taught, that, God chastiseth his own Children, sinning against him; thus when <hi>David</hi> had committed that grand complicated sin in the matter of <hi>Uriah,</hi> by murther and adulterey; though he were a man after Gods own heart, yet the Lord raised evil against him out of his own house, the sword of the enemy departed not from his house, &amp; his own wives were defiled in the sight of the Sun. Now God doth thus chastise his Children least they sinning with the men of this world, should be condemned with them, for as in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us he respects his own justice, so also our own good, and the great profit which thereby is brought unto us, for if we should alwayes enjoy health and liberty, peace and plenty, we should kick against the Almighty, and bitterly esteem the Rock of our Salvation. Wherefore affliction is as the messengers of God, to call us back from sin, to wean us from this World, and to kindle in us a desire of the World to come. Gods afflictions are our remembrancers, and his corrections our instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And besides we must needs confess from hence, that great is the wrath and anger of God for sin, seeing he punisheth it so sharply and sincerely in his own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whom he hath engraven as a signet on the palm of his hand, and whom he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as the apple of his own eye.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 3. Whereas it is said here, that <hi>Ioshua should go over before the people, as the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:36907:111"/>
Lord had said;</hi> we are taught that Magistrates have their calling and hold their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces immediately from God, for the good of the people. <hi>Solomon</hi> was set in his throne by God himself, not by the high Priest or the People, and it is said of <hi>David,</hi> that God chose him from the Sheepfold to feed his people, <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> his inheritance, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. The same likewise was spoke of <hi>Saul</hi> a wicked King, the Lord hath annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee to be governour of his inheritance, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. So then Kings hold of God in chief, and not of men; and upon this ground they are to give up their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to God only and not to man. For as they are next and immediate unto God, and inferiour to none but him; so for all their actions they shall reckon with him: and if you object that of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. Where the People calleth it an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man; I answer the Magistrate is so called, not because men are the authors of it, or may dissolve it; but first, because men do execute it and not God, or the Angels; secondly, because it is ordained for the use, benefit, and profit of men, it is ordained for men.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 10. In this seventh year it was not lawful to require debts, but some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of opinions men have touching this: some say, their debt was clean lost; others say no, but for that year deferred and forborn, after demanded lawfully, and paid willingly; which is more likely, for as much as those pollitick l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ws of God were not ordained of God to overthrow justice, but to preserve it, and direct it in a commendable and fit manner among men, now it is justice to let every man have his own, and there was good reason wherefore that debt should be forborn this seventh year, because that year there was notillage to make money of, a right and true application of this may every feelling heart make in these Cities and Towns, where it shall please God to lay his sore visitation of plague, or any other infection; thereby stopping the trade whereby every man was enabled to get for his mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the discharge of such that were due from him to others, God forbid but that mercy should be found towards their brethren, in those that look for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at Gods hand; when men cannot receive money, they cannot pay, and no disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest meaning, making the stop: but only the Lords hand staying trade, who will be rigorous in such a case, when the earth rested, and there was no tillage to raise money by, you see the mercy of Gods law here; and is it not all one when trade ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? let your bowels then shew whose children you are; if the Image and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of God be upon you, surely you will shew mercy, and give some set time to your Creditors, that mean truly, read what God saith <hi>Isaiah 58. 3. &amp;c.</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member he is the same God still.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 11. THE words spoken here of God himself are thus applicable to his Ministers; first, the Eagle stirreth up her nest, the Preacher stirs and moves, and agitates, the holy assertions of the Congregation that they slumber not in a sencelessenesse of that that is said; and then as 'tis added here, she flutters over her young, the Preacher makes a holy noise in the conscience of the Congregation; and when he hath awakened them by stirring the nest, he casts some claps of thunder, some intimidations in denouncing the judgements of God, and he flings open the gates of heaven, that they may hear and look up, and see a man sent by God with power to infuse his fear upon them; so she fluttereth over her young; but then as it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there, she spreadeth abroad her wings, she overshaddowes them, she enwraps them, she armes them with her wings, so that no other terror, no other fluttering but that which comes from her can come upon them: The Preacher doth so infuse the fear of God into his Auditory; that first, they shall fear nothing but God, and then they shall fear God but so as he is God; and God is mercy, God is love; And the Minister shall so spread his wings over his people, as to defend them from all inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate fear, from all diffidence and distrust in the mercy of God, which is farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in the next clause, <hi>She taketh them and beareth them upon her wings:</hi> When the Minister hath performed all the former acts of his calling, then he sets them upon the top of his best wings, and shewes them heaven, and God in heaven raining down his bloud into their emptinesse, and his balm into their wounds, and preparing their seat, where he stands solliciting their cause at the right hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 35. In this we have a first and a second lesson: First, that since revenge is in Gods hands, it will certainly fall upon the malefactor, God doth not mistake his marke; and then since revenge is in his hands no man must take revenge out of his hands, or make himself his own Magistrate, or revenge his own quarrel: And as we, we that are Christians have our author <hi>Moses</hi> here that tels us this, the natural man hath his secular author, <hi>Theocritus,</hi> that tels him as much, <hi>reperit Deus nocentes, God alwaies findes out the guilty man.</hi> In which the natural man hath also a first and second lesson too; first, that since God findes out the Malefactor he never scapes; And then, since God doth find him at last, God sought him all the while; though God strike late yet he pursued him long before, &amp; many a man feels the sting in his conscience, long before he feels the blow in his body. That God finds and therefore seeks, that God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes and therefore pursues, that God overthrows and therefore resists the wicked; is a naturall conclusion as well as a divine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 40. Where was God now when he lifted up his hands to heaven? here, here upon earth with us in his Church, for our assurance and our establishment, making that protestation, denoted in his lifting up his hands to heaven, that he lived for ever, and that therefore we need fear nothing.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 50. How familiarly doth <hi>Moses</hi> hear of his end, it is no more betwixt God and <hi>Moses,</hi> but <hi>Go up and die.</hi> If he had invited him to a meal it could not have been in a more sociable compellation; no otherwise then he said to his other Prophet, <hi>Up and eat.</hi> It is neither harsh nor news to Gods children to hear or think of their departure; to them death hath lost his horror through acquaintance; they have so oft thought and resolved of the necessity and of the issue of their dessolution, that they cannot hold it either strange or unwelcome. He that hath had such entire conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation with God, cannot fear to go to him: Those that know him not, or know he will not know them, no marvail if they tremble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 51. It might have been just with God to have reserved the cause to himself,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:36907:112"/>
and in the generallity to have told <hi>Moses,</hi> that his sin must shorten his journey; but it is more mercy then justice that his Children shall know why they smart; that God may at once both justifie himself, and humble them for their particular offences. Those to whom he meanes vengeance, have not the sight of their sins till they be past repentance. Complaine not that God upbraids thee with thy old sins, whosoever thou art, but know, it is an argument of love; whereas, concealment is a fearful sign of a secret dislike from God.</p>

THough it be not a difficult matter to impose upon the sence and judgement of men, with whom tin may pass for silver; it is not so with the judge and searcher of the heart, he soon discovers our adulterate coin, by that silver touch-stone of his law, he that created the light and darkness, must needs know both, he seeth the exteriour Acts, thy light before men, he vieweth the hidden vaults and recesses of that mind, the darkness of thy heart, therefore his law here is called a law of fire, he pleadeth in flames, by this fire he examineth thy dissembled humilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and repentance, thy solemn devotions, the stubble and trash of thy performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8. In this Chapter <hi>Moses,</hi> blessing the twelve Tribes, gives to each a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction proper and peculiar to its self. All but <hi>Levi</hi> in this Text were for temporall ends, and their Legacies are answerable; <hi>Moses</hi> gives them as much as they care for: <hi>Zebulun</hi> and <hi>Issachar</hi> shall be filled with the Treasures of the Sea and Land, and that's enough to stop their mouths. <hi>Benjamin</hi> shall be blessed with repose &amp; security, and heel gladly sit down with that. But now it is not wealth, nor ease, nor honour that best suits with the Ephod: All worldly blessings are jewels of too low a price, too faint a blaze and lustre to be set there: And therefore of <hi>Levi</hi> 'tis said, <hi>here let thy Thummim and thy Urim be, upon thy holy one.</hi> That, that is conferred upon <hi>Levi</hi> must be divine and heavenly. <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> Perfection and Illumination, and both must proceed from God after a peculiar manner; and therefore 'tis said in the Text, <hi>thy Urim,</hi> and <hi>thy Thummim,</hi> and <hi>thy holy One.</hi> And so it is not our own perfection, nor innate holinesse, nor our own illumination or private spirit, neither is this holy One, one of our own making, any invention of man, but an Order found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God himself.</p>

Though God do not call us as he did <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up our Children, yet he requires us sometimes to neglect both Children, and parents, and all natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations for his sake; and surely in such a case, <hi>Piet as est impium esse pro Domino, It is piety towards God to be unnatural to our friends;</hi> Our blessed Saviour hath told us, <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more then me, is not worthy of me,</hi> Mat. 10. Another Evangelist useth a more harsh expression, <hi>he that cometh to me, and hateth not all these,</hi> Luke 14. Strange that love its self should require hatred; but yet just, not in an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, but comparative sense, we must not love Father or Mother more then him, yea, when their desires come in competition with his will, we must hate them for him; we must say with <hi>Levi</hi> here, <hi>nesio vos, I know ye not;</hi> trampling under foot all natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which would hinder us from obedience to divine inventions.</p>
