         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>By vertue of this Summons, a Generall Aſſembly was to
meet at <hi>James-Town</hi> in <hi>Connought, Novemb.</hi> the 6th. laſt: but the
appearance probably was then very ſlender, and the power
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did (as it had done before at <hi>Longh Reagh)</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint
the formall concluding of any matters of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
In <hi>Leynster, Munſter, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster,</hi> all the Cities, Burroughs,
Towns, and places Habitable (almoſt) were in <hi>Engliſh</hi> hands,
if any Meſſengers could be found to deliver Summons, no

even in <hi>Connought</hi> the Two head Cities were at once beſieged,
and the beſiegers of each were ſo fearles of being raiſed or
diſturbed by all the Forces of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that divided as they
were, they yet further ſubdivided themſelves, and marched
abroad conſtantly to ſeek out Enemies, and take in Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
all that lay within any reaſonable diſtance. It muſt needs

                        <head>An Agreement betwixt Charles the 4th. D. of
Lorrain: and Theobald L: Viſcont Taaf; Sir Ni:
Plunket, and Geoff: Browne, deputed and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed
by the Kingdom and
people of Ireland.</head>
                        <p>1. THe moſt Illuſtrious Duke is to be veſted with royall power,
under the Title of Protector Royall of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Becauſe Religion is the prime end and ſubject of the Treaty: all
is to begin with an imploring application to the Pope for his paternall
benediction, and Help, that He will not be wanting in things ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
or temporall: in conſideration whereof it is proteſted, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
perpetuall obſequiouſneſs of duty and faithfulneſs ſhall be paid
to his Holineſs, and the Apostolick See.</p>
                        <p>3. In conſideration of this Royall Protectors power granted, the
Duke is by war to proſecute the Kings Enemies, and afford Him all
poſſible aſſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>4. The ſaid Duke is to do nothing in abrogation of the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
or juriſdiction in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but rather to amplifie it: and
having reſtor'd the Kingdom, and Religion to their due, priſtine
eſtate, He is to reſigne cheerfully the Kingdom to the King.</p>
                        <p>5. Before reſignation as aforeſaid, the Duke is to be re-imburſed
all by Him preimpended in this buſineſs: and for this re-imburſement
a generall, exact obedience to the Duke in faith and fidelity from the
Kingdom and people is made, and to be obſerved; without reſervation
to any other Superiority whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>6. The Duke is not to fail on his part to expell out of <hi>Ireland</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
Enemies to Kings, and Religion: and to recover and defend
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115384:4"/>
all things belonging to the faithfull Subjects of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. The Duke is ſolely, and abſolutely to exerciſe all military power,
for the preſent and future in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as to the nomination of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
and guiding all martiall proceedings at his own pleaſure,
and in his own perſon: unles He in his abſence ſubſtitute ſome other
Catholick perſon.</p>
                        <p>8. The Duke is to introduce no innovation into the Towns, &amp;c. to
him Aſſigned repugnant to the ſecurities, priviledges, Immunities, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties,
Lands, Eſtates, or antient Laws of the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> reſerving only
to Himſelf Authority to apply remedy in any thing accruing, wherein
publick prejudice may be concerned.</p>
                        <p>9. The Duke is not to interpoſe in Adminiſtration of judiciall, or
civill Affairs, but leave them to be proceeded in according to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
Laws, and politick forme by the Kings chief Governor, and
the Aſſembly inſtituted.</p>
                        <p>10. The manner of calling Aſſemblies to be as formerly, unles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
ariſe againſt their Government, or other extraordinary emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cys
hinder: and then according to the antient Laws, the calling of the
Aſſembly is to be at the pleaſure of his Highnes.</p>
                        <p>11. When the work is done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by conſent of a General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
the Duke promiſſes to afford Agents to the King, againſt rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
adverſaries in other Kingdoms.</p>
                        <p>12 In caſe the Duke cannot go in perſon into <hi>Ireland,</hi> it is free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in
his choiſe, and pleaſure, to depute any other able man of Catholick pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who ſhall be independent in the militia, and in civill matters ſhall
be received to all manner of Councels in the ſame right, as any other
Counſellor, or Commiſſioners.</p>
                        <p>13. All Cities, Caſtles, Lands taken from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
to the Owners, if Catholicks who have conſtantly perſever'd in the
Catholick Quarters under the Duke, yet the Dukes military power ſhal
be intire over the ſame, to Garriſon, and diſpoſe of them for publick ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
at his pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>14. All pay to the Souldiery is to paſſe from the Duke, as well out
of the publick Revenue, as of the Dukes coffers, when that fails: always
provided that what the Duke disburſes of his proper, for publick uſes
for the future, be repaid Him, as his former disburſements.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="5" facs="tcp:115384:4"/>
15. All goods of Enemies, and Delinquents, are to be converted to
publick military charges, and towards rewarding great merits by the
Duke, with adviſe of the Generall Aſſembly.</p>
                        <p>16. The Duke beſides 20000 li. already contributed, promiſſes all
further accommodations and ſupplements of War, together with his
power, and induſtry, whatſoever is not above the reach of his Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and beneath the neceſſities of the War: towards repayment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
as well principall, as the annuall provenue, and uſe thereof, the whole
Nation of <hi>Ireland</hi> is to be liable, untill the last penny paid, and for

            <p>Here is diſcovered a ſtrange ſodering, and patching toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of contrary intereſts, by four ſeverall parties on the one
ſide, only that <hi>England</hi> may be undermined; and betrayed
by the conjunction of their Counſels, and Forces on the other
ſide. Here is the pretended Vicar of Chriſt, the pretended
King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the pretended Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Plemipotentiaries</hi> from the Generall Aſſembly of the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,</hi>
and all theſe make their adverſe pretentions reconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115384:5"/>
to each other, in this tranſaction, that they may appear
againſt <hi>England,</hi> like the Foxes which <hi>Abſolon</hi> coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with firebrands in their tailes, when he intended to burn
<hi>Joabs</hi> ſtanding Corn. The Pope would certainly govern <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
intirely, and imediately by his own ſubſtitutes, if it were
poſſibly to be obtained, rather then admit of theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the King or Duke: but ſince all cannot be obtained,
He will lay hold of what ſhare he can. The King likewiſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
affect ſuch rivals as the Pope and Duke: nor can the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Ireland</hi> voluntarily envaſſal themſelves to ſo many Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors:
nor would the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> take the whole burthen
of this rugged adventure upon himſelf, without better ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but al of them bearing a joynt ſpight againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
for the ſatisfying of that common ſpight, are willing, though
againſt their wils, to daub up their own particular concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with morter, altogether untemperd. It is not worth
while therefore to inquire at preſent, what it is that all theſe
treat for here joyntly, tis the dividing of <hi>Englands</hi> ſpoiles, as
appears by the 6t.. 11th. 15th. Articles, but let us a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what that game is, which every one of theſe Treators
hunts after, and purſues ſeverally.</p>
            <p>The Popes ends are to be found in the 2d. and 1<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Articles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That help, and benediction which is expected from <hi>Rome,</hi> is
not to be beſtowed in vain: if the Pope will now ſet to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
hand, and by his holy croiſadoes, and other devote
ſpells, contribute treaſure to this work, <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
return to his obedience, nay <hi>Ireland</hi> being happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
<hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall be attempted in the next
place. We ſee the ſtuped old Biſhop dos not yet deſpair:
though God has already powrd out ſome vials of his wrath
upon his ſeven-hilled See, and rent away from him more then
a 3d. part of his Territories, and though there are more viale
yet remaining, that muſt diſcharge more indignation ſhortly
upon his Throne: Yet all this dos not quite deterr him from
looking after new acquiſitions, and re-inſtallments. Well: let
him morgage a good part of Heaven to raiſe money, and let
him imbarque that mony in this expedition of the Duke of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115384:5"/>
               <hi>Lorrayn,</hi> we are ſtill confident his Empire is in its declination,
and thoſe cups of blood which have been lately fild to Him,
by his Command in <hi>Ireland,</hi> are the laſt that he ſhall ever
quaffe in ſuch exceſſe.</p>
            <p>The Dukes ends are provided for in the 1. 5. 7. 8. 10. 12. 13.
14. 15. 16. 18. 20 Articles. He is by Title to be Protector Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and by that Office to aſſume regal power to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and Deputies: the adminiſtration of civill, and judiciall
affairs is to be left to a Generall Aſſembly, as formerly, or to
the Kings Deputies, and Miniſters: but this in time of War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to nothing: becauſe the military ſword is abſolutely,
and independently girt upon the Dukes thigh; and tis well
enough known, that in times of war the power military over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awes
the civill as much, as the civill ought to overaw the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
in times of peace. Moreover, the War is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
till the Duke pleaſes, and if any diſpute ariſe in the
mean time betwixt Power, and Power, here is a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of authority to the Duke to apply remedy: what
that means: I leave to conjecture. Beſides, the Duke is to have
ſome ſhare in the civil adminiſtration alſo, and the iſſuing of
the Treaſure, &amp; managing of the publick Revenue is prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
in Him: and till his disburſements be ſatisfied (of which
there is not yet no Auditor but himſelf) for principall, and
provenue. All <hi>Ireland</hi> is his morgage: yea divers of its chief Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Fortreſſes are to be his in poſſeſſion, for more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſecurance, and caution. Upon promiſe of this ſecurity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſigning of the Treaty, the Duke ſent 20000 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway,</hi>
and ſince the full ſigning of the ſame, ſome other ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
of the like value have been ſent from the ſame hand, and
queſtionles, if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commiſſioners were able to grant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to the Duke, the Duke has contracted warily enough
for himſelf, but the main thing contracted for is yet in <hi>Engliſh</hi>
hands, ſuch as regard neither of the treating parties. So in
concluſion, the Duke is his own ſecurity: all that he has trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> is but a crackt Title: his own coffers
muſt ſtill purchaſe that which is to repleniſh his Coffers: and
the expence of his Militia, muſt recover that which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115384:6"/>
him for the expence of his Militia; It behooves the Duke
therefore now to lay all at ſtake, and not to dally away his
Treaſure in Crums, (eſpecially ſince He is diſmiſt of the Duke
of <hi>Newburghs</hi> entertainment,) for all the body of his mercina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Larro<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s, (if he had ſwimming Carriages, ſufficient to their
march,) and all the plunder, and hire that that body has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richt
him withall, are ſcarſe ſufficient to enſure this one <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi>
bargain to him.</p>
            <p>The yong titular Kings ends are condition'd for, in the 3.
4. 9. 11. Articles: The Duke promiſſes him fair, but leaves him
nothing elſe to depend upon, beſides bare promiſes. Yea, and
the Commiſſioners alſo (to whom the Duke has promiſt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
of the Crown after all demands ſatisfied, and
debts paid) treat by a Commiſſion from the Kingdome and
people of <hi>Ireland,</hi> not ſo much as mentioning Him: if then the
yong Titular King was privy, &amp; conſenting to this Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
ſo directly threatning the extirpation of Proteſtants here
cald Hereticks, and the confuſion of <hi>England</hi> here made the
Pray of ſo many Hunters; we may ſafely conclude, that he
has abjurde both Religion, and Country; nay we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
further, that having poſtponed all other things to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
aimes of his own, in the purſuing of thoſe aimes, He is
rather tranſported with counſels of blood, and revenge, then
of hope and advantage. But if his conſent was not paſt to theſe
Articles, ſo diſhonourable, and injurious to himſelf, his <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Subjects are not ſo loyall, and faithfull to him, as ſometimes
they would faine profeſſe themſelves to be, and as his tame
complyance with them ſeems to merit at their hands. How
wiſe his Councellors are, I cannot apprehend; for when I
conſider that the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have been perpetually
courted by him, and gratified with condiſcentions againſt
his Religion, againſt his Honour, againſt his Conſcience, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his inclination: and yet nothing was ever hitherto held
out to the Governing party in <hi>England,</hi> but the red Flagg of
defiance: his Counſels ſeem to me unfathomable.</p>
            <p>The advantages of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are now laſtly to be look't af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in the 1. 2. 6. 12. 13. 15. 19. Articles. For they are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115384:6"/>
to be reſtored to their own forfeited Eſtates: but rewarded
alſo for their bucheries, and outrages with all that pertains
to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> They are to have negative voices in all Truces,
and Treaties of peace. They are to be governd by a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prince, and in his abſence by a Catholick Deputy: till the
Duke declares himſelf fully ſatisfied, and continued. They
are to have the Popes Croſier as predominant amongſt them
as ever formerly. In brief, they are to have Popery ſecured to
them for ever, by vertue whereof, they ſhall be abſolved of all
blood by them already drawn, and enabled to ſhed, as much
hereafter upon all occaſions offred, for ſince they have not
pawnd, but really ſold themſelves in fee to the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> (knowing, and foreſeeing their Countries inſolven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and that the Dukes pretences are never probably to be
anſwerd in this age, though right reckonings might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected)
that dear Religion of theirs, which ſo ſweetned to
them by the ſacrificing of Hereticks, muſt needs be indefeaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
eſtabliſht amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe things ſumd up together, need no Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
to be made upon them: every <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, that knows
what belongs to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, will be a ſufficient Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tater
to himſelf. In obſerving of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> eſpecially (for the
other 3. Treators are forrein to us) and their ſincerity in
Treating, no man can be deficient: for they we ſee here, whilſt
they are profeſſing fidelity to the Parliament, and ſeeking free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of their own conſciences, yet are Articling with the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and other Potentates at the ſame time, to
root out the very name of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Proteſtant from the
face of the earth: and though they have alwayes made their
Kings Cauſe a principall part of their quarrell againſt us,
notwithſtanding that He is our profeſt enemy: yet upon all
advantages they are ready to caſheir him, though He he hath
always followed his Fathers ſteps in this, in keeping a ſecret,
ſtrict, and ſervile correſpondence with them: yea, and Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſo much guilt of blood for their ſakes, as all the water
in the Sea betwixt <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> will never waſh off
from his unhappy Family.</p>

admire, you ſhould follow the ſame, which it hitherto hath proved to
your content, may hereafter prove unhappy to you according to your

venturing mens lives, in a juſt cauſe, (ſuch as I own being for my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,

any great enterpriſe. But ſuch as hazard mens lives without a juſt cauſe

(when you reflect on your own actions) you will find your ſelf as guilty
as others. Your Letter to the Mayer, Aldermen, and Burgeſſes of this
Town I delivered them, knowing their honeſt and gallant reſolution to
be ſuch, as they may not be drawn or tempted to any the leaſt diſtruſt or

               <head>A Reply to Preston.</head>
               <p>SE here old <hi>Prestons</hi> confidence: Becauſe he fights for his
King, County, and Religion: Becauſe the Citizens of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway</hi>
adhere unanimouſly to him: becauſe he has a <hi>Maxime</hi>
of War to warrant him: and becauſe he ſuppoſes there is an
inſnaring intent in the favourable Conditions offered by the
Lord Deputy: therefore he ſtill reſolves to run the hazard of
a longer Siege, and will rather abide the worſt events of war,
then accept of the favour here tendred. Death has lately
bereaved us of that Pen that would, and beſt could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to there cavillations: nevertheleſſe ſuch a fained plero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phory
of confidence as this muſt not paſſe without ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115384:9"/>
And firſt his Lordſhip ſhould have affirmed, that He
fought for a juſt King, for an oppreſſed Country, and for a
religion truly Chriſtian: for that which he now affirms is but
of little weight, in as much as all Kings, all Nationall Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
all Religions are not juſtifiable, nor to be maintained by
force at all times. And as to this particular caſe, the King here
intimated is ſuch a one, as in a ſolemnly-ſworn, <hi>Scotch</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
has renounced, and diſcomiſſion'd <hi>Preston</hi> himſelf, and
all his adherants, as Enemies to his <hi>Scotch</hi> Covenant, yea,
and to requite this renuntiation of the King, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> at the
ſame time have offred to renounce him, and to alienate the
Crown from his poſterity. Let it be provided; that Popery
may be eſtabliſht in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the buchering of 500000 <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>
Proteſtants remitted: and there are plemipotentiaries in
<hi>England</hi> at this inſtant, that will conclude with us about eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Monarchy out of <hi>Ireland</hi> for ever. This ſhews how ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
this Governor of <hi>Galway</hi> makes Kingly intereſt one prop
of his Cauſe, and one Plea for his Conſcience in a diſpute ſo
bloody, as this has hitherto prooved, and ſtill is likely to
prove. Then for his Countrey that affords him as weak an
argument for the upholding of his Courage, as his King.
For 1. that which he cals His Country has no place to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene,
and vote in but Woods and Boggs: and divide <hi>Ireland</hi>
into 10 parts, and 7. of thoſe ten have laid down arms, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Parliament: and deſire protection no otherwiſe,
then as they diſavow all that were guilty of the firſt maſſacre,
and continue now in hoſtility againſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> 2ly. admit
there were any right of Government in that <hi>minor</hi> part of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives,
which <hi>Preston</hi> here cals his Country, meerly becauſe
they continue to abett, and juſtifie by force the firſt Rebellion
in 1641. Yet ſtill he knows, thoſe fugitives themſelves are now
ſubdivided into ſeverall parties, and contrary counſels. One
part of them is now treating with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> about
a reſignation of <hi>Ireland</hi> into his hands, an other is propoſing
contrary termes to the Common-wealth of <hi>England.</hi> 3ly.
Grant all <hi>Ireland</hi> undivided, in a free Generall Aſſembly, did
impowre <hi>Preston</hi> ſtill to maintain by Armes, that horrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115384:10"/>
and barbarous exception of 1641. will he imagine,
that ſuch a Power can make the demands of ſatisfaction, and
expiation illegall in the Engliſh, or a deniall of the ſame le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
in Him, and his Principalls? He may aſwell ſuppoſe that
Law civill may abrogate the Law of Nature? and that the
commands of impious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bloody man, may ſuperſede the moſt
fundamentall inſtitutions of God. What an incredible ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
is this in <hi>Preſton</hi> then, that he puts any compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
his own Cauſe, and the Lord Deputies, when all the
world knows his Sword is drawn to maintain the moſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
outragious ſlaughter of Chriſtians, that ever the earth
was made drunk with, and guilty of, and the Lord Deputies
is drawn only to recover due vindication for the ſame? But
<hi>Preston</hi> alledges further that He is Religions Champion, as
well his Kings, and Countries: and this muſt needs move ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much with all that know his Religion, for we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
by his Religion, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> commands in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
equall at leaſt with Jeſus Chriſt, even as on Earth the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> governs almoſt ſolely, and intirely above all
that is called God. By his Religion, divine merits ſuffice not
without humane additions By his Religion, the Pope may in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vert totally Gods moſt ſacred Ordinances, making Inceſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domy,
Perjury, Rebellion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> excuſable, and commendable as
often as they ſerve his advantages, and pretentions by his
Religion, an abſolute ſoveraignity is due to the Pope over all
Princes, and Governments, and to deny the ſame attaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man of hereſie. By his Religion, Hereſie is a ſufficient cauſe
to expoſe whole Nations, to the deſtruction of his emiſſaries,
yea if Oaths have been made to preſerve them from deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thoſe Oaths are to be avoided, and falſified upon paine
of damnation. By his Religion, many thouſands of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
infiduouſly murdred before open War in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſince
164<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> were piouſly ſacrifized to Chriſts Vicar at <hi>Rome,</hi> and for
him to defend theſe ſacrifizers, merits much of all the Angels
and Saints in Heaven. Of this Religion therefore which thus
inables the Pope to do things diabollicall, whilſt it pretends
to clothe him with divine Soveraignity, more need not be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115384:10"/>
ſaid; if this Religion be in any proportion, or ſhadow anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to that which was Preacht, and practis'd by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
let <hi>Preston</hi> ſtill injoy his confidence in it.</p>
               <p>The 2d. thing that buoys up the ſpirit of the Lord of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragh</hi>
is the unanimity, and ſtoutnes of the Townſmen under
his Command: and this to us ſignifies very little: for when a
Company of Tradeſmen, and Mechanicks has a Governor to
flatter them with ſtories of the Lord <hi>Forbes,</hi> a Prieſt to inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
them with fables of Purgatory, and a Souldier to aw them
with Pikes, and Muskets: tis no great wonder if they promiſe
compliance, and give way to their Mayor, and ſome few Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
to ſubſcribe for them. Nay if the Lord of <hi>Taragh</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſeem at preſent, as things now ſtand, to promiſe himſelf
much from this agreement, and ſubſcription of the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that is as little to be wondred at; becauſe it may very
wel be notwithſtanding, that he which now ſpeaks big words
upon the approach of Winter, may yet reſolve to be more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
to reaſon, when the approach of the Spring ads more
advantages to his beſiegers. He cannot chuſe but remember
that in 1650. He had as much aſſurance of conſtancy and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
from the Tradeſmen, in <hi>Waterford,</hi> as he has now in
<hi>Gallway,</hi> yet both he and the <hi>Waterfordians</hi> in the end found
cauſe to lament that unhappy aſſurance. <hi>Drogheda</hi> ſuffred for
its obſtinacy, though it was the firſt Town that rejected fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
let <hi>Gallway</hi> then and <hi>Preston</hi> too, conſider what it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
reject favour at laſt caſt, and to remain obſtinate after all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places of conſequence are reduced: let not the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
fair warning be too far ſlighted.</p>
               <p>A 3d. thing that animates his Lordſhip, is a <hi>Puntilio</hi> of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
which ſome rude, meer ſword men reverence, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
as a <hi>Maxime</hi> of War; and by this <hi>maxime</hi> a Commander
in chief is to prefer his own repute before the ſaving of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
under his charge: and tis declared to be forfeiture of
repute to him, to accept of conditions from an Enemy whilſt
they aree too favourable, and too timely. All the miſery
which fell upon <hi>Waterford</hi> by Peſtilence, Famine, and the
Sword in 1650. might have been prevented by this Lord of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115384:11"/>
                  <hi>Taragh,</hi> (at that time Governor there) had not his Honour been inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with the acceptance of the terms then offered: and the termes then
offred were better then his Lordſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> afterwards accepted without any
blemiſh to his Honour, they were only diſhonourable in this, that they
were offerd too ſoon, and before the City had ſufficiently taſted the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of a laſting Siege. At that time before a Sacrifice had been made of
10000 men, to the Repute of this famous Generall, twas not fit for him to
march away, but after this due right, and ſolemnity performed, He had a
<hi>maxime</hi> of War to warrant the rendition of the place upon termes more
diſadvantagious. We know not when, where, not by what Senate of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialiſts,
theſe tyrannous Laws of Honour were Enacted, but the tyranny
of them is very manifeſt, and by this Tyranny <hi>Iredah, Wexford, Limerick,</hi>
and ſome other places in <hi>Ireland,</hi> have been lately brought to very ſad, and
tragicall Caſtrophes: and it ſhould ſeem <hi>Preſton</hi> thinks himſelf ſtill neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by the ſame, to bury himſelf, and <hi>Gallway</hi> in honourable Aſhes. The
Lord Deputy taking juſt ſcandall at ſuch ignorant mercinary ſwordmen,
as theſe who follow armes out of choiſe, not neceſſity, and not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
Honour rightly defined, ſhed blood for formality, no<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> policy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
calls the profeſſion of them unhappy: and this <hi>Preſton</hi> ſtomacks at, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts,
as if the Lord Deputy were himſelf of the ſame Profeſſion. Herein
his ignorance appears ſtill more at large: for the Lord Deputy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did not
ſpeak diſdainfully of all, but only of ſuch Souldiers as fall under the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
diſtinction: He is as much miſtaken in Souldiers now, as He was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the Honour of Souldiers: and this ſhews that his rude, and truly
unhappy trade never tought him rightly either to define, or diſtinguiſh.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing that hardens <hi>Preſton,</hi> or rather that is made uſe of by
<hi>Preſton</hi> to harden the Townſmen of <hi>Gallway</hi> is this; that the Lord Deputy
intends no more favour to them, notwithſtanding all his fair offers of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
then he dos to the Souldiery, and the reſt of the deſperate incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in <hi>Gallway,</hi> whom he excludes from it. And he tels the people the Lord
Deputies deſign is onely to breed variance, and diviſion betwixt both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that both might be made his prey the more eaſily. Nay he is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to tell the people that <hi>Limerick</hi> was bet<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ayed, and loſt by the ſame
fraud. What are theſe people aſhamed of? all the world knows, that <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erick</hi>
after great hardſhips, and diſtreſſes endured in a long Siege, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at laſt to ſubmit to that <hi>ingens telum,</hi> which we call neceſſity: and thoſe
miſerable people that are ſtill ſurviving after all thoſe Calamities, will be
ſad witneſſes, that they may curſe that obſtinate unity that made them
hold out ſo long, not any factions, or diſſentions that made them ſubmit
ſo ſoon. The Engliſh were never guilty of circumventing Enemies by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties,
and of all <hi>Engliſh</hi> men there was never any one more averſe from
deluding ſnares then the Lord Dep: <hi>Ireton:</hi> let them but name one Town
in <hi>Ireland</hi> during all theſe Wars, that ever loſt by timely yeelding, or had
cauſe to boaſt of long holding out, and this argument ſhall be wholly
granted them.</p>
