            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But by his iustice (where Christes deeth hath not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte) he must nedes condemne. The seconde lye is this / that that repentaunce is the only esatisfac cion that god wolde haue made and done for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sinne / for if this be true / then is oure faith falfe. For oure faith holdeth that if Christ had not dyed for vs / we had all perished.

            <p>Now let vs se how properlye he answereth<note place="margin">Frith.</note> vnto his awne question. And you shall finde mo blasphemyes agenst Christ in his answere then preceded in his argument. Thinke you this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath not taken greate paynes?</p>
            <p>To prepare him silf vnto his matter he brin<note place="margin">Thre lyes atonce.</note> geth in thre lyes in the first chaptre. The first is he saieth that onlye the soule suffereth and not the bodye / and maketh Comingo / whom he fay neth to be a Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man / to graunte it well and

wyselye. Forsouth this is new lerninge in dede.

But I repor te me vnto youre awne selues if ye cutte but youre fingre / fele ye no payne? and yet I thinke ye will not saye that ye cutte youre soule From hence forwarde if you se a pore man shyverin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge for colde in the streate / you maye bidde him walke a knave and bere him in hande that he fealeth no harme / for as this man sayeth his bo dye fealeth no harme / and I promysse you of ho neste that his soule catcheth no colde. But what nede I to make mowordes of this matter sith you maye make experience youre selues? The seconde lye is this. <q>That man was created of god to do him honoure and service.</q> For if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maye saye the truth man was not made for the entent to be a servaunte and do service.

            <p>But the cause why he made man was this that man shulde haue the fruicyon of his ioye<note place="margin">why man was made</note> and honoure. Soch was his goodnes / he made vs not that he shuld haue any pleasure by vs / but that we shulde haue pleasure by him.

For this is no formall argument / it is mete that the bodye which offendeth with the soule shuld be purged with the soule / ergo purgatorye must be vppon the erth. For god maye ioyne the bodye and sou le to gether agayne after they be departed and so punish them to gether although purgatorye were not in erth / even where so ever it be.

If thou abstayne for feare / so arte thou vnder the lawe and vnder condemna cion: The lawe of god and the lawe of man are farre vnlike. for the lawe of man is fulfilled by the exterioure acte although the harte be ferre from it. As if I owe a man. xx. pounde and be compelled by the lawe to paye him at a certen daye: if I them paye it albeit myne harte be ne uer so grugginge and euill willinge / yet haue I fulfilled the lawe so that there shall no processe or sentence passe agenst me.

            <p>Be sides that the occasion why he wrote y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> boke entitled enchiridto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was this.
