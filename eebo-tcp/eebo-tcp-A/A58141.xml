            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

e're I sleep, if possible, I'le either see or discourse with her;

prove more pleasant, if you wou'd home to Bed, and fancy
her one of those fine Ladys you've Courted and enjoy'd; that
is the true Elizium slumber! Hang these Night-spirits, the

my loose desires: But which way shall we effect your kind
Contrivance, which you for my advantage have design'd?
for <hi>Theodocia</hi> will not quit her Vows she made to <hi>Courtly,</hi> and
your old man intends she shall be <hi>Loveall</hi>'s Bride.</p>

Daughter-in-Law shou'd be yours; for I'de so work upon the

true: I'de add some Cyphers to your small Estate, to make
it swell above your Rivals; his Covetousness wou'd then be
assistant to the Cheat, and make him embrace you for his
Son-in-Law.</p>

Madam, can you pardon one who basely has suspected Virtue
and Innocence—some small excuse I have, though not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96626:31"/>
enough to justifie my wrongs to your fair self; for meeting
this Fellow with my Picture which I had given you at my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of Town, and he affirming he had it from his Wife,
and it being reported in the Country that you were Marryed,
made me conclude this was your Husband, which made me

generous Constancy, and I should rather ask your pardon
for having been the Original of your past troubles, tho not
wilfully; for Fainting last night at the door, and having
your Picture in my hand, I dropt it; but when I came to
