         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE.</head>
            <p>FOr the better clearing of this ceremony to be no duty of this text of Phil. 2.10.11. be pleased in briefe to take notice of these foure particulars: First, what the Fathers (whom <note n="*" place="margin">Page 84.85, 86.110 unto 141. <hi>None of the Fathers tell us (writes he) that this reverence of bowing the knee is to be done at the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, neither is there ANY ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse or full autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in them Therefore all that I strive for is that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers by their exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this text do not crosse and contradict that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which our Church doth seeme to gather out of it. In a word, I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should bee fully for me, but I hope to make good that they are not against me. I desire in this matter to have them lookers on: So he against Bp.</hi> Andrewes <hi>and others, who say all the fathers are for them, that is, not for, but against them.</hi>
               </note>Mr. <hi>Page</hi> confesseth not to bee for this ceremony) generally interpret to be the name above every name mentioned in this text. Very many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> interpret it to be nothing else, <hi>but the very name of God, and Deity of Christ it selfe.</hi> So <hi>Tertullian</hi> de Trinitate. lib.

            <p>Secondly, What they meane by <hi>bowing the knee.</hi> Not any actuall bowing of the knee in this life, at the sound, sight, or hearing of the Name Iesus; but a <hi>Vniversall subjection of all creatures to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lordship, judicature and supreme power of Christ, especially at the day of judgement, when this text shall be onely actually, litterally, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fulfilled.</hi> This all the Fathers and Writers quoted in the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, <hi>Lame Giles,</hi> and premises, and all the Authors extant that I have seene, accord to bee the genuine, true, undoubted meaning.

And is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3312:10"/>
not this case the same?

When men shall repeate, <hi>I beleeve in God the Father allmighty Maker of Heaven and Earth</hi>; without any great reverence or bowinge of the knee; And then pronounce the next words, <hi>And in Iesus Christ our Lord,</hi> with a stentorian voice, bowinge both the body and knee very superstitiously (I should say devoutly,) as soone as ever the word <hi>Iesus,</hi> is uttered, before <hi>Christ our Lord</hi> be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, out of their greate reverence and respect to this name <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> (which they here preferre before <hi>God the Father allmighty and Christ our Lord,</hi>) And then shall proceed to, <hi>I beleeve in the Holy Ghost</hi>; and utter that without any such Ceremony or solemnity; Or when they shall pronounce, <hi>the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> with much solemnity, cappinge and genuflection when <hi>Iesus,</hi> (not <hi>Lord and Christ</hi>) are pronounced; And then shall slightly passe over, the <hi>Love of God the Father, and the comfortable fellowship of God the Holy Ghost,</hi> without any such Ceremony or incurvation.

            <p>If <hi>Iewes</hi> or <hi>Infidells</hi> should come into our Churches, and observe this difference and disparity, would they not forthwith conclude, that we had no other God but <hi>Iesus</hi>? that the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> were not esteemed of us to be God?

Paul, there, speaketh of the great authority and power, which is committed and given to Christ, by which power every creature of Heaven, Earth, and Hell, is made subject unto him, even the Divell himselfe, with all the wicked and damned Spirits, will they nill they are all under his feete, and the words which goe before shew this sufficiently, for it is said, <hi>God gave him a name, that is above all names, that all knees should bow in that name</hi>; which words if yee will apply unto the divine worship, as though they, which worship God be in Purgatory; Then must you grant also, that the Divells and all the damned Spirits doe worship Christ. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> Name in this is taken for dignity and honour, and so it is used allmost in all tongues, especially in the Scriptures, it is a familiar speach. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore, by this word, Name, signifieth high and great power to be given to Christ, and Christ, to be sett in cheifest

               </gap>ein, are most monstrous. But, sayd I follies? I might say more and say but right.

Indeed, they are easily deceived, that will not search for truth, and they are justly given over to strong delusions, that delight in errour, and have not a love to the truth; otherwise, the place to the Philippians would not be mistaken. But looke wee a little at the same, and marke from whence the Apostle tooke it, and compare spirituall things with spirituall things. The

               </gap>bjection, submission, and obedience of all creatures to his beck, rule, and governement. For, what materiall knees have things in heaven, hell, &amp;c. This knew the ancient Father <hi>S. Origen,</hi> and therefore writing upon the 14. to the Romans, where these words be againe, hee saith, <hi>Non est carnaliter hoc accipiendum, quasi caelestia, ut Sol, Luna, Angeli, genua aut linguas habeant, sed genuflectere signi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This knew <hi>S. Ierome</hi> also, and therefore he saith, <hi>Non at genua corporis, sed ad subjectionem mentis &amp; inclinationem spectat, Sicut David dicit, adhaesit pavimento anima mea.</hi> It doth not belong to the knees of the body, but to the subjection and bowing of the minde; as David saith, my Soule cleaveth to the earth or dust; noting his inward humiliation, not a reall and outward matter. For, shall wee thinke (saith hee) that either heavenly things,<note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>Kings,</hi> 19.18.</note> or all earthly things have knees? No, I say againe, but by this phrase of speach, is meant subjection, whereof bowinge of the knees is a signe. As when he saith, <hi>I have left mee 7000. men which have not bowed the knee to Baal</hi>: That is, which have not bine subject to that Idoll. <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator libidini genu flectit &amp;c.</hi> The Fornicatour is said to bow his knee to Lust, the covetous man to his riches or desire, the proud man to his pride, &amp;c. because they are subject to these things. <hi>Et toties Diabolo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Iewes and Infidels have abhorred the name of Iesus, I grant, but no more the name of Iesus, than the name of Christ, seeing Iesus is Christ, and Christ hath as much deserved to be hated of them as Iesus, Christs name may a thousand times be heard amongst you, and no man mooveth capp or knee, Iesus is no sooner sounded, but every man by and by putteth of his capp, and scrapeth on the ground with his foote; And yet not all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, or in all places, but in the Church and especially at reading of the Gospell. This may breed a more dangerous opinion, than any it can remoove, that Jesus is better than Christ is, and more worthy of reverence, which is wicked to imagine.</p>

worshipped not our Lord God therein, but the Sillables or letters, or other materiall elements, whereof the word written or spoken consisteth; and all this by Sophistications to drawe the people from due honour and devotion towards Christ Iesus, which is Sathans drift, by putting Scruples into poore simple mens mindes at his Sacraments, his Saints, his Crosse, his Name, his Image, and such like to abolish all true religion out of the World and to make them plaine Atheists. But, the Church knoweth Sathans cogitations and therefore by Scriptures and reason, warranteth and teacheth all her children, to doe reverence whensoever Jesus is named, because Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes doe not honour these things, nor count them holy for their matter, colour, sound and syllables, but for the respect and relation they have to our Saviour, bringing us to remembrance and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of Christ, by sight, hearing, or use of the same signes; Else; why make wee not reverence at the name of Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>us the Sonne of Syrack, as well as Iesus Christ? And it is a pittyfull case, to see these profane subtilities of Hereticks to take place in religion, which were ridiculous in all other trade of life. When we heare our Prince or Soveraigne named, wee may without these scruples doe obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, but toward Christ it must be superstitious. Thus the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists. To whom M. Cartwright thus replies: This dirt which they dash us with, is as well made of them, as throwne by them. For it is false, that wee will have no reverence to be given to the name of Iesus; wee say, that there ought to be no other honour, or reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence given to it, than to the name of Christ, of Lord, of God: And further wee say, that this supplenesse of your knees, in bowing at the name of Iesus, is nothing but a mask to hide the straitnes and numbnesse of all the joynts of your heart and Soule in your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, to the Commandement of Iesus. For, it is well knowne that your knees which are cammel like in the courtesie which you give to this name, are joyntlesse and Elephantlike in your obedience unto his precepts, to whom this Name appertayneth.

The vaunt of Scripture for proofe of this worship must needs avaunt. For this, being the onely stay and prop, which they can pretend out of Scripture, makes nothing for it.</p>
            <p>First, for that this name of Iesus in this place signifieth not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> any title or note whereby Christ is called, but his Authority and whatsoever is glorious and excellent within him, as in diverse places it doth likewise appeare.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for that hee understandeth not by this word, knee,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the member of the body whereby they honour, but (by a borrowed speach) the subjection and bending of all creatures unto the infinite Power of Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st, so that the soules departed, and Angells (which have no knees) are subject to this courtesying, as well as men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon earth. If therefore the heavenly Spirits can yeild this subjection unto Christ without courtesying at the name of Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us, it followeth, that this Exposition of bowing the knee is farre from the meaning of the Apostle in that text.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for that the kneeling and courtesying heere spoken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of, is performed as well by the wicked and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

This Scripture making nothing for them, their reason, allthough it were likely cannot beare it out. And whereas they would free themselves from su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition in syllables, because they bow not at the name of Iesus the Sonne of Syrach, as to Iesus the Sonne of God, whilest the knee jumping with the very first utterance of the word of I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

this Service. And, seeing the name of Iesus in the Sonne of Nun, and in the High-Priest of that name, of whom onely wee are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that they were rightly thus called, is the same with the name ascribed unto Christ,<note place="margin">

               </gap> reason honour may be withdrawne from the one which is given to the other, especially considering they had not this title of Iesus in their owne right, but in the right of Christ, whose figures and lively representations they were. And if others might withhould it, yet you which give the same honour to the Image, which you give to the thing it selfe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceived, so to doe. What will you answere to this, that as you are in danger of superstition in the former point; so in this you are charged with profanenesse, who neither capp nor knee at the name of Jesus out of the thing, when the name is the same, and as well to be honoured without, as within the Church?

               <hi>Finally, our learned</hi> Doctor William Fulke, in his Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rhemists Notes and Testament, on Phil. 2. Sect. 2.8.10. <hi>determines thus</hi>: First IT IS CERTAINE, that the bowing of the knee at the sound of the name of Iesus IS NOT COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANDED NOR PROPHECIED IN THIS PLACE. But it pertaineth to the subjection of all Creatures to the judgement of Christ, when not only Turkes and Iewes, which would y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eld no honour to Jesus, but even the Devills themselves shall be constrained to acknowledge that he is their Iudge. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the capping and kneeling at the name of Iesus is of it selfe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different thing (therefore no duty of the Text) and therefore may be u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed superstitiously as in Popery, here the people stoup at the name when it is read, not understanding what it meaneth, or, what is read concerning him. And also in sitting and not veyling at the name of Christ, Emanuel, God the Father, the Sonne, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, and bowing ONLY at the name of Iesus. It may be used also well (<hi>perchance</hi>) when the minde is free from Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in signe and reverence of his Majesty, and as in a matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in CHRISTIAN LIBERTY OVGHT TO TAKE PLACE. And DVE REVERENCE may be yeelded to our Saviour <hi>(and so the very words of the 18. Canon which our Bishops much insist on, fullfilled) without any such outward Ceremony of capping and kneeling.</hi>

What the Fathers and forraine Writers have determined of this Ceremony, hath beene else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where manifested, not one of them making it a duty, either commanded or insinuated by the Text; I hope therefore, the zealous Patriots of this new-coyned duty, will forbeare the urging of it, untill they shall proove it a duty of the Text, by argument, scripture, reason, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
