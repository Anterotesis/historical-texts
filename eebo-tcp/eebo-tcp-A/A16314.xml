         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

having take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this
worthy <hi>Author</hi> to
himselfe, pitty it were
to entombe his labours in the
grave of silence together with
him; the rather considering how
usefull a member he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
beene to the Church of
God, and what prosperous suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
his endeavours have found
in the hearts of Christians. The
thing hee chiefly aimed at, was
<hi>fruitfulnesse</hi> in the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God had set him; which oft
he enjoyed experiment of (to the
cheering of his spirit) in no smal
<pb facs="tcp:11602:3"/>
measure. It cut the very heart
strings of his righteous soule, to
see many dry &amp; withered bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
(fit for nothing but the
fire) cumbering the precious
ground of the Almighties gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
and possessing the roome of
more growing plants. Hee was
wonderfull active in the cause
of Christ, and desired as well to
<hi>doe good</hi> as to <hi>be so,</hi> where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hee came. It was not the
least of his care, not to live unto
himselfe: He knew he served
a good Master, which made him
studious of improving every ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for the best advantage; wel
may hee bee called good, that
makes others far the better for
his goodnesse: And indeed set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this aside, what hath the
creature to commend him to
God, or releeve his soule in any
distresse?</p>
            <p>Thou hast here in briefe the
soule of man unbowelled before
thine eye, and that masse of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb facs="tcp:11602:3"/>
lodging in a carnall
heart (together with its <hi>power</hi>
and <hi>plague</hi>) discovered unto
thee, wherein is plainely demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
the miserable condition
of a man guided by the <hi>flesh,</hi>
and the happinesse attending
such as are led by Gods <hi>Spirit;</hi>
as also the bitter conflict of these
two opposite inmates in a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
soule, with the meanes of
victorie.</p>
            <p>Our life is nothing but a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
warfare, every moment wee
are more or lesse to encounter
with adversaries; Satan al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
labours the destruction of
the Saints, though his wayes to
effect it are not one &amp; the same;
sometimes he inticeth men to sin
by allurements, sometimes by
vexing and disquieting their
inward peace, at least he aimeth
to make the life of a Christian
uncomfortable by his manifold
assaults; hee is vigilant to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
upon all occasions as he can
<pb facs="tcp:11602:4"/>
espy opportunity, and will not
cease to assaile, though he be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome;
when hee cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
by flatteries, he seekes by
force and violence to overthrow
the poore servants of Christ.</p>
            <p>Amongst his many snares
to entrappe our poo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e soules, this
is not the meanest, that he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to divide the kingdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it selfe, and to use men
as <hi>his</hi> instruments for their
<hi>owne</hi> destruction; Satan well
knowes that comming in his
owne likenesse, he would seeme
very odious and soone be resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
therefore he maskes under
a vaile of <hi>humility</hi> that he may
the more securely withdraw us
from our hold in God.</p>
            <p>But we have a valiant lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
let us sticke unto him, even
Iesus Christ the righteous, who
is a <hi>Lion</hi> of the tribe of Iuda, <hi>a
mighty Prince</hi> able to tread all
our enemies under foot; well
may Satan barke and roare but
<pb facs="tcp:11602:4"/>
he can stir no further then God
gives him liberty; he cannot
tempt whom he will, nor when
he will, nor how he will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
permissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> above; he may
desire to sift us <hi>as wheat,</hi> but
the Lord wil make choise of the
temptation, and set bounds to
our enemies malice, thus far you
shall goe and no further.</p>
            <p>If a child have his father by
the hand, though he be in the
darke, or sees any danger ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
yet he feares no hurt;
neither shal we be dismaid with
any temptation, whilest by the
eye of faith we see that <hi>invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
one</hi> ready to support us; the
chiefest strength of soldiers ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in their captaine, who yet
must fight for themselves and
him, but our whole strength ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in Christ, who by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
power subdueth all
things for us; of our selves wee
have no ability to prevail against
the strong one in the world, all
<pb facs="tcp:11602:5"/>
our victories come from God;
we are too weake to withstand
the least temptation through
our owne strength, but relying
upon the Lord we shall be more
than conquerors over the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.</p>
            <p>It had been much to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
that this holy man had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
the publishing the residue
of his worthy labours, that so
they might have come more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
&amp; polished into the worlds
view, however, pitty it is that
goodly childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should be brought
to the birth, and there perish for
want of helpe to bring them
forth. These things in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
found much acceptance
and wrought effectually in the
hearts of many, who knowes
whether a further blessing doth
not yet attend them?</p>
            <p>Deare Christian next unto
the glory of God, thy good was
chiefly aimed at in bringing this
worke to light; be not therefore
<pb facs="tcp:11602:5"/>
wanting to thy selfe, and thy
soules blisse. Remember the
<hi>day</hi> cannot alwayes last, the
<hi>night</hi> will come, and thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not how soone: This may be
the last booke that ever thou
shalt reade, and this the last
houre that ever thou shalt spend
here on earth; Oh use it consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably,
and blesse God for any
furtherance in thy way to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
While thou hast the light
beleeve in the light, and walke
in the light, that then maist bee
the child of light. Occasions
are headlong, being once past,
they cannot be recovered. The
five foolish <hi>virgins</hi> came too
late, and were shut out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Thy time is short, the art
of well doing long: on this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
depends eternity, of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse
if it be well, of misery if
it be ill imployed. Hee that is
not ready for God to day, will
be lesse sit to morrow. It is no
time to begin to live, when thou
<pb facs="tcp:11602:6"/>
art ready to dye; then to seeke
after heaven, when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
to thy Crutches; At length
grow spiritually wise, let the
best things have the best place
in thee. It will be too late when
thou art in hell to say, oh that I
had been more religious and
provided better for my soule;
be exceedingly abased for thy
former neglects; let it wound
thy soule that thou settest out no
sooner, and art yet no further in
the race of godlines; get ground
of thy corruptions <hi>now</hi> daily;
count that a lost day, in which
thou art not somewhat bettered,

of Sinne, which is im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ployed

Chapter a speciall
meanes to shun this ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable
danger; namely,
the <hi>righteousnes, obedience,</hi>
and <hi>sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi>
And in this Chapter fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enlargeth the same
by way of confirmation
unto the 5. verse. After
which lest it might bee
thought that a Christian
may live as hee list, <hi>being

of Christs death,</hi> or that
a profane person should

claime any interest in that
blessed sacrifice of Christ,
he further proveth by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pregnant reasons, that
every Christian ought to
endeavour after holines,
that thereby hee may
prove himselfe to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ingrafted into Christ,
by participating of the
fruit of his Spirit, and that
hee is in deed (and not in

amongst the rest of

            <p>The reason why the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <note place="margin">Reas.</note>
is, because so strict is the
Union betwixt the one
and the other in an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
man, that as a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11602:11"/>
couple they seeke
the preservation of each

twins,</hi> they laugh
together, they weepe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and are alike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected:
A bloody heart,
and a bloody hand, a false
heart and a false tongue,
a lascivious mind, an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous
eye; yea and
which is more, so strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sometimes is the <hi>soule</hi>
overcome with the love
of the body, that whereas
by nature, <hi>reason</hi> should
command (and rule the
<hi>flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as the weaker vessell)
the belly and backe so
subtly insinuate and creep
into favour with the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
that as the
foolish wife with her
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11602:12"/>
beauty and composed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
over-ruleth her
husband, though a man of
understanding; So these
importunat cravers never
give over their suite unto
<hi>reason,</hi> they make it a
drudge to sensuality, and
an attorney to sollicit the
cause of meere grosse and
carnall pleasure.</p>
            <p>In consideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
(I meane because of
this mutuall intercourse
of the soule and the body
in accomplishing of sin,)
many learned Divines
have made this a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Whether the soule bee
first infected with the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the body or no?</hi> but
of that I will not stand, it
being besides our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11602:12"/>
purpose, onely thus
much I note, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the <hi>flesh</hi> to intimate
the mutuall confederacy
betwixt the soul &amp; body
of man, how that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of sin he is now wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
made a slave and vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
to fleshly desires.</p>
            <p>And therefore likewise
it may bee supposed that
the Holy Ghost nameth
the <hi>flesh</hi> onely, as a man
that blameth the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Wife</hi> for the lewd
action done by her <hi>hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi>
For albeit, sinne ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
principally, in the
soule as poyson in the
teeth, yet it sheddeth and
disperseth it selfe at his
pleasure actually into the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11602:13"/>
members of the body, of
whom it is aptly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
as occasion is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.
And as the whole
toad is called a venomous
creature because of some
one part preserving poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
(the rest being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the same virulent
infection:) So the whole
man is said to bee sinfull;
not as if the body of it
selfe, as it consisteth of
bones &amp; sinnewes and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
arteries can proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bee said to be sinfull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
then as the

dwellers. Albeit I graunt
as the <hi>serpent</hi> was a fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
for the <hi>devil</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his subtilty, so the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:11602:13"/>
body and all the parts
thereof being corrupted,
are become unto the
wicked soule, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
tooles for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer,
or as a picklocke,

stricken a stroke in the

            <p>That our whole man is

thinke on this, it would

            <p>As a loving father set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

giveth him a chest to

he might lay up whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

being tainted with the

will hold nothing; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already furnished
with divers impressions
of worldly matters, is no

principles of Gods truth,
or to retaine that which
may be his onely comfort
longer then a dynt struck

whence it commeth that

his whole religion consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting

himselfe firmely and
effectually to remember
any thing, unlesse it be a

4. <hi>Concerning the</hi> Will.</p>
            <p>The former faculties
of the soule are called <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative;</hi>
there is another
kinde called <hi>practicall,</hi>
which are, the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
and these are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in <hi>action,</hi> as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<hi>Will</hi> is the absolute <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi>
in a man, and the
<hi>Vnderstanding</hi> is his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor.
Now whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Will</hi> was counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

and so was both able and

marvaile, for if the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
which should be
the guide thereof bee
grosse and carnall, the <hi>Wil</hi>
cannot bee spirituall. It
must needes bee a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
State where the <hi>Prince</hi>
wanteth wisdome, and
the <hi>people</hi> due moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Concerning the</hi> Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>affections</hi> likewise
which are divers disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of mans soule stirred
up by diversity of objects,
are more stained with
fleshly corruption then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other part of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:11602:28"/>
besides, which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their violence,
make a carnall person to
be caryed like a mad man
upon a wilde horse, so as
he can neither stay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
nor bee staid by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Which fleshly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
consisteth in this,
that they are moved unto
contrary objects; for those
which should bee stirred
up by the evilnesse of an
object to abhorre it, doe
in that respect, embrace it
and move towards it; and
those which should bee
moved by the goodnesse
of an object to embrace it,
doe in that respect abhor
and shunne it. For which
cause they may fitly bee
compared to a bedlam,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:11602:29"/>
who rageth and raileth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his keeper, or unto
a sicke body, which loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that which would
worke the cure, hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
still after that which
engendreth corruption
and increaseth his disease.
For example, whereas
man should love God,
and embrace each
thing as incites ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
contrariwise he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
God and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
yea and embra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth
from his heart each thing
which may most soundly
and effectually kill and
slay that affection in him,
soft apparell, sweet meats,
faire building, outward
pompe, rich coffers, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
company, sleepe, ease,
(what if I say whores and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:11602:29"/>
harlots) these be his loves,
these be his mistresses,
these be his Paramours,
and all these in a carnall
man are like entising mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
labouring to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
his affection from
his maker. <hi>You cannot
love God and Mammon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 15.</note>
God is a jealous <hi>husband,</hi>
he will not communicate
the pleasure that hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in an honest heart,
maryed to himselfe, unto
any stranger.</p>
            <p>Againe, whereas at the
first, man joyed in the
fruition of the presence
and favour of God, in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and meditating of
him and his workes; now
he taketh no pleasure
therein at all, but if by the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:11602:30"/>
               <hi>Law,</hi> or for <hi>shame</hi> hee bee
drawne to some spirituall
exercise, nothing is more
tedious unto him, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is imprisoned in a seat,
his minde walketh about
all the while, either hee
climbeth up unto one of
the scaffolds, viewing his
friends, defying his foes,
or else is in his shop coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his ware, plotting
some bargaine, or the
like.</p>
            <p>Moreover, whereas
we should bee sorrowfull
for our sinne, we are sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
that wee cannot
sinne, <hi>poverty, sickenesse,
danger, prison, displeasure,</hi>
strike us downe dead:
but the poverty of the
<hi>soule</hi> stript naked of Gods
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:11602:30"/>
graces, the sicknesse of
the minde, able neither to
see nor know the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
grieveth us not at all.
Whereas in the time of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy
man relyed himself
upon God for an happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and gave credit to
his <hi>promises;</hi> now though
he protest and binde it
with a solemne <hi>oath,</hi> no
man beleeveth him;
though hee hath sent his
beloved Sonne from his
owne bosome to ransome
us out of our spirituall
captivity, and left it for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in perpetuall record,
witnessed by <hi>men</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells,</hi>
yet who regardeth it
in his heart? or blesseth
God in his soule for the
same? <hi>Iesus Christ of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:11602:31"/>
the Carpenters sonne,</hi>
was too base a fellow to
gratifie the stately perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
of our times: No,
the <hi>Gods of England</hi> shall
deliver us, <hi>wit, learning,
beauty, strength, friends,
riches, nobility, sinne, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi>
this present <hi>world,</hi>
any thing save Jesus
Christ. So that hereby it
is manifest that man is so
farre from having affiance
in God, that he is at defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with him, refusing
and renouncing his patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
and protection.</p>
            <p>By this therfore which
in cursory wise hath been
uttered, you may easily
perceive how fearefully
this fleshly poyson hath
dispersed it selfe, over our
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:11602:31"/>
whole man, and made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
faculty of soule and
body swell with pride,
and ambition against
God; yea and like a mad
dogge, to byte and snatch
at every hand, even them
of his owne nature. As a
light <hi>Chariott</hi> drawn with
wilde horses, and driven
with a blinde man (wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to give the raines
whither soever the horses
will runne) must needs be
in great danger of shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
all to pieces; So
the understanding being
deprived of light, which
should give notice to our

must needs in the
end overthrow both soule

calamity of the whole

This is that which in thy

so much disability he hath

that to be preserved
from the strength of our

onely use of the good
graces which God hath

this <hi>fleshly heart</hi> of ours
will never sound a retreat,
it is like a wounded

a man that hath in some
measure overcome his
lusts, will bee farre more
sensible of their stirrings
and struglings, then ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
in whom they rule
without disturbance. Sin
is kindled by that which
quencheth all other fires,
and surely <hi>grace</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisheth
other tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
doth <hi>occasionally</hi>
enrage the <hi>flesh,</hi> though in
regard of exercise and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
power it dye daily.</p>
            <p>The reason is, because
a thing in its proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:11602:38"/>
is never tyred; who
ever knew the Sea give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
raging, or the streame
grow weary of running?
Now corrupt motions are
as naturall to a man as the
course of a river. Though
there may be difficulty in
<hi>fulfilling</hi> lusts, there can
never be any in the rising
and sprouting of lusts. It
is no paines to conceive
seede, though it bee to
bring forth a birth; the
longer any man lives in
sinne, the sweeter it is to
him.<note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>The eye is not satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with seeing, nor the eare
with hearing;</hi> no more is a
sinner with his deeds of
darknesse, if he should live
for ever, hee would sinne
for ever. Evill comes out
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:11602:39"/>
of the heart, as sparkles
out of the fire, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cease while the fire
continues. Lust is like a
furious rider, never wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the way, hee may
have enough to load him,
but can never have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to weary him; he
may quickly have enough
to <hi>sinke</hi> him, but can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have enough to <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi>
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lust</hi> it selfe growes
never olde nor weary,
when <hi>adultery</hi> in the
heart hath worne out the
<hi>body,</hi> so as it strength wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth,
yet even then it
will finde a vent in a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
eye, unchast speeches
and thoughts full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanenesse.
Though a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11602:39"/>
man may weary himselfe
in the <hi>acting</hi> sinne, yet
lust is never satisfied in
<hi>conceiving</hi> sinne.</p>
            <p>Lastly, consider the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
               <hi>propagation</hi> of this sinne,
which may well therefore
be called an <hi>olde man,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it dyes not, but pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from one generation
to another. A mans actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
sinnes are <hi>personal,</hi> they
both beginne and end in
himselfe. But originall
sinne is <hi>naturall,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
together with our
nature it passeth over to
our posterity. It is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
that can never be cut
off, it hath held from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
and so will continue
to the worlds end. Every
parent is the channell of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11602:40"/>
death to his posterity.
<hi>Adam</hi> diffused damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to all mankinde. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it any wonder that
from a cursed root, should
proceed branches fit for
nothing but the fire.</p>
            <p>What a watch then
should we keepe over our
evill hearts,<note place="margin">Vse</note> what paines
should we take by prayer
and unweariednesse of
spirit to suppresse this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie?
If there were a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
time wherein the flesh
did sit still and sleepe,
wherein the water did
not runne and seeke for
vent, wee might then les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
our care, but since it
is ever stirring in us, wee
should bee ever stirring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, using all meanes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:11602:40"/>
to diminish and abate the
same. Since the heart is
unwearied in evill, wee
should not faint nor bee
weary of well-doing.
Since the heart is so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
in evill, we should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
likewise in every good worke.</p>
            <p>Retaine in thy freshest
memory such quickening
thoughts as these: If I
commit this sinne, it will
cost me unvaluably more
heart-breake and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
smart, before I can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
assurance of pardon
and peace of conscience,
then the sensuall pleasure
is worth. If I never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
it will be the ruine
of my soule for ever.
When thou goest to buy
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:11602:41"/>
a commodity, if the price
be great, thou forbearest,
and wilt thou venture up
on sinne, knowing what
it will cost thee? If <hi>Iudas</hi>

as now he feeles, hee

that villany. Alas,
thy soule is incomparably
more worth then the
whole world, and wilt
thou for a little paltry
pleasure of some base and
rotten lust, which passeth
away in the act, hazard the
losse of so precious a jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell?</p>
            <p>Doe not consider the
smalnesse of thy sinnes,
but the greatnesse of thy
God, who is displeased
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:11602:41"/>
with them. Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is tedious, but heaven
is sweete, men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to goe all day after
their hawkes and hounds,
enduring hunger and
thirst, for a little pleasure
not worth the enjoying,
why then should wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
any labour for the
obtaining so rich a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?</p>
            <p>In lust a man wearieth
himselfe and hath <hi>no</hi> hope
but here our labour is not
in vaine in the Lord, wee
shall reape if we <hi>faint not.</hi>
A little glory in heaven,

all our travaile

the scandall of the Gospel
and the wounding of
thine owne soule? How
should the consciousnesse
of this humble thee in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
before God?</p>
            <p>Brethren, think of this,
the more vile any man is
in his owne eyes, the
more precious he is in
Gods. And the best way
to bring a man to a base
esteeme of himselfe, is to
reflect his thoughts seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
upon his owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
to view himselfe in
his naturall condition;
There is no good, so truly
good but his heart abhors
it; No evill so extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wicked, but there is an
inclinablenesse in him to
embrace it; no servant so
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:11602:44"/>
ready to doe his masters
will, as hee is to doe the
workes of the devill, no
rebell so desperately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
to his lawfull sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
as hee is to God.
Oh that men were truely
sensible of their carnall
condition.</p>
            <p>The want of this, is the
cause of all that security
and deadnesse of spirit,
which seares up the heart
of many thousands of
people. This makes so
little care of being saved.
Hence it is that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
preached is so smally
reckoned of, the name of
Christ is no more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the word of grace no
more honoured, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of salvation no more
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:11602:45"/>
laid hold on, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
after, the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of hell no more
stood in feare of then
they bee; it is indeed one
and not the smallest part
of our native wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that our eyes are so
holden with selfe-love
that wee cannot perceive
our misery, nay, wee are
pleased with it, and think
it a peece of our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to continue in it.
Wee have not onely no
disposition to goe from
it, but which is worse, a
strong desire to remaine
still therein. Where is the
man that truely discernes
he is lost and undone, that
sensibly groanes under
the weight and burthen
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:11602:45"/>

so much as a graine of

so much as frame a

the very earth is weary to

            <p>Lastly, to prevent sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisalls
by this cruell ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
study his <hi>policies</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the strength of the <hi>flesh</hi> be
very great, yet the policy
thereof doth farre exceed
it: for being not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed

of our safety, with

Sathan cannot deceive us
unlesse our owne <hi>flesh</hi> assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
him, doe first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us. The danger
whereof is so much the
greater, because it is so
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:11602:46"/>
deep and disguised, that it
can hardly be discovered
and found out: it displayes
not its colours in open
field, but lyes hid in
secret ambushments, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
it selfe with our
owne forces, and making
a shew of simplicity, and
sincerity, when there is
nothing but craft and, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
in it, perswading us
that we are nothing so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

wee are, and that those
good things which wee
seeme to have are of farre

wronging no man, that so

            <p>Infinite are the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

seeme to spit at

yet what man is there in
whose bosome <hi>secretly</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
doth not plot &amp; devise
wicked enterprises. The
more time a man spends
to make himself acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with himselfe, and
begs of God to reveale
the hidden corruption of
his evill nature to him,
the more abhorrency and
condemnation will hee
have of himselfe, and the
more adoration and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment,
at the infinite
mercy of God, that hee is
not consumed; when once
a man hath his evil wayes
discovered to him by
Gods spirit, he will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based
and confounded in
his owne sight. It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

but ignorance that

chosen nothing to glory
in but his owne shame.

vertue, that as one graine
of muske giveth a stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
perfume than many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grosse smells: So
doth that sweeten all our
actions in the nostrils of
God. And as a man albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
all the parts of his body
be dead, so that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knowes nor sees, nor
can speake, yet if he have
any life in a corner of his
heart, any breath, or any
motion remaining, none
will be so hard hearted as
to pull him out of his bed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:11602:60"/>
and bury him as a dead
man: So although in this
life we have many a dead
palsie; many a dint, many
a dry buffet by the hand
of Sathan; yet so long as
the breath of God is in us
and we keepe the truth of
the spirit, like the star of
a diamond, it will cause
us to shine in this darknes
of our corruption, and
like an antidote, preserve
us against eternall death.</p>

Is it not a strange thing

what strange children

walke in obedience and

Ah fearefull times, what

               <p>True it is,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> that haynous
sinnes are more terrible,
because they waste and
destroy the conscience at

hell with headlong fury:
but little sinnes unrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

seeing they cause a

bring men by degrees to
eternall condemnation.
Doe but gather the least

Drops are but small, yet

though thou lightly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest

them; Doth not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
sinne by prevaricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
dishonour the Lord,
how dares then a sinner
call any sinne small? A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

<hi>faithfulnesse</hi> or unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

must not consider what
wee have done, but how
great hee is whom wee
have offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. It is not the
least thing in mans life,
to neglect such things as
seeme to bee least, and I
know not concerning
what faults wee may bee
secure, seeing we must be
judged even for sinnes of
ignorance, and give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of our idle words
and thoughts. The lesse
discernable a vice is, the
greater care wee should
have to avoid it. Wee
soone come to the sight
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:11602:69"/>
of great sinnes, and so to
repentance for them,
whereas wee persist and
goe on in the lesser with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

therefore to take heed of
the least, as though they
were the greatest; for so
much the more easily shal
we abstaine from any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
by how much the
more wee are afraid of
committing it: that man
seldome falls fowly, that
is fearefull of falling at all;
sinne is Satans livery,
which who so ever wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
weares, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
his soveraignty,

Though the most sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

<hi>imperfections</hi> and frailties,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:11602:70"/>
yet to live in the least of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against knowledge
and conscience, is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
signe wee are in the

that truely hates one sin,
will hate all of the kinde.
There is not any sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
but leaves a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

it. If the gate be set open
the enemy will soone en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in. Witnesse the many
experiences of Gods
children, who winking at
smaller sinnes, have beene
plunged into greater. If
once thou givest leave to
thy corrupt affections to
play their parts, thou
shalt hardly make them
give over. Little sinnes
usher great ones and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:11602:70"/>
bring them into the closet
of thy heart. How dares
then a sinner call any sin
small, when as the Sonne

               <p>The holy Ghost uses

Epitome of mans future

know that hee

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:11602:72"/>
that in such a taverne
whither he usually goeth
posting with his cup com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
there standeth in
one of the drinking pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
a man with a pistoll
charged with white pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of purpose to shoote
him through; I imagine
how gladly hee would
leave his wine and sugar
and betake himselfe to
his heeles, yea and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
him his friend that
would push him over the
threshold and thrust the
doore after him. And
this not without reason;
for as a man would bee
willing to give all that he
hath, yea and to lose some
of his limbes to redeeme
his life. (<hi>Skinne for skinne

pronounced

their hands on their

Gods judgements as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
thou doest at the

jesting with thy maker, or
playing the foole with

               <p>If further you demand
what shall be the state of

of God and condemned
to death?</p>
               <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> if men may
bee deceived in judging
of the creature subject to
sense, and outward being;
much more hardly are
they able to conceive of

For which cause as

of <hi>everlasting,</hi> tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

all the glasse of humane

in full conceit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
it, or come neere it,
neither can it be knowne
of any fleshly creature,
saving onely of such as

               <p>Yet least any man here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

esteeming death eternall

thereby fearfully deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from Gods <hi>power, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
and <hi>glory</hi> in inflicting
justice; the holy Ghost
hath given us some secret
items concerning this
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:11602:76"/>
point, and slightly, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
runne it over, as a
Painter with a little white
lead drawing forth the
great Elephant; not so
much teaching us what
it is, as what indeed it is
not.</p>
               <p>The first thing touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
this matter to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
briefly, is, the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of these carnall
men before spoken of,
from the presence and
glory of God; whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
as it is the head
and heart of all felicity, so
to bee deprived of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
presence is the
very summe of all misery.
For as a grievous malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
once in favour with
his Prince, bound in chains
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:11602:77"/>
of iron, hung up on the
top of an hill, debarred of
all mortall helpe, set apart
to be consumed with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
night and day, filleth
the hils and dales with his
restlesse moanes, and stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the most speedy pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
with the hollow
cryes of his extreme mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Or as a Princes daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
set on shoare by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
shipman, where is
nought but trees and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
lyons, beares, and
antilopps, debarred of all
comfort, within the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the groveling
dens, compassed about
with seas: So and much
more fearefull is the state
of that man whosoever he
be, that is banished from
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:11602:77"/>
the presence of God in
regard of the graces
of the spirit, which
are the infallible pledges
of his love and favour,
however he enjoyeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
outward good things,
as the stranger in a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Court may make him
selfe glad with his wine,
though altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,
or at least with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any speciall notice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of him by the Prince.</p>
               <p>But when God shall 1.
strip him of all temporall
blessings, as riches, honor,
health, wealth, friends,
peace, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. When he shall make
himselfe knowne to his
blinde soule with a more
manifest and apparant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:11602:78"/>
of his glory in
justice, declaring the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
hee hath of his
supposed knowledge, his
unconscionable consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
his devillish wil and
corrupt affections.</p>
               <p>3. When hee shall first
shut the doore upon him
that leadeth unto life, and
then also for ever cast him
out of his presence, as a
man that throws a toad or
serpent out of his garden,
and that into the place of
everlasting torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (Lord)
what tongue can expresse,
or heart conceive the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
estate of this forlorne
or abject creature? To be
out of favor with a Prince
is much, but to be out of
favour with God, who can
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:11602:78"/>
abide it? There is no man
living unlesse he be despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
but either hee think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himself high in Gods
favour, and therefore is
still peaceable within
himselfe, or else is posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with such a spirit of
slumber, that the faculty
of due pondering the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse
of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
is taken from him;
as in a <hi>dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kard</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> neither
regardeth his frendnor his
foe, but when the drinke
shall be out of his head, as
at the departure of his
soul, then shall hee strike
his knees together, &amp; his
heart shall bee cold as a
<hi>stone;</hi> like that of <hi>Nabal,</hi>
when the feast was past,
and hee had heard the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:11602:79"/>
judgement denounced:
then shall hee open his
eyes as the man which
hath beene blind from his
birth, and behold the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of God upon him.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>Presence</hi> of God
in this place I doe not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
a bare locall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence
with God:<note place="margin">Job 1.</note> so Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
may stand before
God; neither can any
thing created go from his
presence, <hi>hee being in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 139.</note>
                  <hi>in hell, and in all places:</hi>
but by his <hi>Presence</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
as the holy Ghost
teacheth me, the comfort,
the joy and blisse which
betydeth the Creature
through his presence.
Now what the losse here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may be, I leave to thy
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:11602:79"/>
owne heart: and yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fleshly, may happily
err, or not esteem so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
To helpe thee in a
word; <hi>Adam</hi> after his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
fled from Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and the Lord ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, for indeed hee cast
him out of the garden
where hee had communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and fellowship with
God, yet so, that hee left
him certaine signes and
tokens of his former dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
both spirituall and
temporall in soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
from whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that wee his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
doe yet retain some
resemblance of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
happinesse, though
our holinesse is quite lost:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:11602:80"/>
We have Lordship over
all the creatures, wee are
fed with the fruits of the
earth, we have some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of person, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of majesty, beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
the beasts, yea we have a
smack of God: And in
politicall matters, yet
preserve some slender and
slight footings of his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and providence:
the <hi>King</hi> ruleth, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
obey: the heaven, the
earth, and the stars yeelde
themselves according to
the will of the Creator,
propitious unto man, hee
enjoyeth their light, their
influences, their fruits, &amp;
sundry commodities: And
all this because man (albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
out of the garden of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:11602:80"/>
the place of delight,
yet) is still as long as hee
liveth in the Cookes gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:
being thrust (as it
were) out of a most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
parlour, where God
appeared in glory, into a
more obscure place of
lesse communion with
him.</p>
               <p>Now when the <hi>first</hi>
death commeth as a sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
to the last judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
man is deprived in
an instant, of all preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
comforts and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
favours, and plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into an infinite depth
of woe and bottomlesse
gulph of wrathfull mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
his body strangely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
being severed from
his soule which gave it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:11602:81"/>
both life and reason, yea
and deprived of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
succour excepting a
ditch in the earth to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his bones and Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
unto the time of the
resurrection. All which
(marke it) by the decree
of the just Judge of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
shall for ever be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of all shew of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
or the least drop of
mercy, and be exiled the
Courts of the Almighty,
world without end.</p>
               <p>Here the Kings of the
earth shall bee degraded,
the Lords and Ladies of
the Court abashed, and
each rich &amp; stately person
utterly disherited of all
his substance.</p>
               <p>To bee out of favour
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:11602:81"/>
with the world is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to weake flesh, but
to bee discountenanced
with God, this is the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
of all misery: Every
creature then beholdeth
with a threatning face, the
heavens lower, the earth
frownes, and withdraw
themselves from our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
For as hee that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the good will of the
<hi>Master,</hi> loseth also the
heart of the true and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
servant; So he that is
once discountenanced
with God, all creatures in
heaven and earth make
head against him. Oh
that our great landed
men (as wee call them)
which have seated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for ever (as they
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:11602:82"/>
suppose) would consider
of this tragicall ruine;
they are so shamefully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled
with the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
countenance of the
harlot <hi>voluptuousnesse,</hi> the
strength of pleasure, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from worldly wealth
hath so dispossessed them
of their wits, that they
rave in the pride of their
hearts, not considering
their latter end. Out beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
I scorne thee, my
land is worth three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds by the yeer,
and wilt thou presume to
keepe mee company, &amp;c.
Ah consider that thou art

to the <hi>flesh,</hi> and
therefore must <hi>dye.</hi> All
outward things shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:11602:82"/>
thee, thy wealth and
credit, thy pastime and
acquaintance, all shall bee
abandoned, God himselfe
will strippe thee of these

with shame for ever; In

of mercy, thou caryest
the bagge for a season, but
it shall one day bee rent
from thy side, and God
shall bee glorified in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thee naked.</p>
               <p>The second thing to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
bee considered is that
great reproach which
shall seise on the carnall
man after this life, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the cleere revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

reputation by challenging
the benefit of the <hi>law,</hi> in a
case not sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
against us. But at this
time the skirts of thy pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
shall be discovered
before the <hi>sun,</hi> and though
thou <hi>wipest thy mouth</hi> (like
the <hi>harlot</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi>

yea all thy cradle
sinnes, which never yet
were set on foot, (thy
wicked and abominable
thoughts I meane) which
lye lurking in thy heart as
in a denne, not daring to
come abroad, for feare of
losing thy credit. Oh the
fearefull reproach ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hereupon, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a sober man and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
matron, so falsely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
of in the world,
shall have their vizzards
pluckt downe from their
faces, the ulcer of their
hearts launced, and all the
buried corruptions of
their childhood, of their
youth, and riper age,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:11602:84"/>
plainely before men and
Angels, Saints and blessed
Spirits, devills and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
laid open, to their
eternall shame. Imagine
that thou being a man of

shouldest have all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities

thy conscience gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
testimony, and all
the night practises of thy

thee, even in the high
Court of Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy Prince and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
how couldst thou
shew thy face? Now thou
pluckest thy garment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thee to cover thy
shame, but then thou shalt
bee stript naked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothed,
to the reproach
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:11602:84"/>
of thy selfe and thy whole
family: now thou shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
thy iniquity in a
closset or secret chamber
from the eyes of him that
cannot pierce the walls:
then shalt thou stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the face of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
in the presence of
him whose eyes are as a
flaming fire, knowing the
secrets of thy parlour and
polluted bed, thy words,
thy thoughts, the place,
time and every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of thy sinne: Now
thou overlayest the drosse
of thy heart with a guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
outside of joy and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
but then the Lord
shall blow upon the paint
of thy face, thy withered

espyed: now like <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi>

thy selfe with pretended
holinesse; but at that time
the Lord shall defeate
thee, and display thy hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie.</p>
               <p>To conclude, what cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
a man having one
foote on the earth, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
in the grave, halfe
dead and halfe alive, to
acknowledge some capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
sinne, which in his
health hee would not for
all the world? The Lord
will make thine owne
conscience impeach thy
selfe, and discover thy
transgressions: Thou
thinkest not so, so thought
<hi>Iudas,</hi> but as then with
him, so also with thee,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:11602:85"/>
the case will cleane be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>

their death, is their socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

it a fearefull thing
to see a <hi>Spectrum</hi> or diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall

to our weake nature; but
to be really present with
Sathan world without
end, a companion in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
what earthly man
can abide it. To bee in a
prison full of Murtherers,
it is horrible, but in that
bottomelesse pit with
thousands of condemned
spirits abject and forlorne

It is not thy stocke and

outward bravery that will
serve thy turne when

death, all the world will
not be of sufficient credit

once be throughly wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
like a wilde beast it
will then shew his fiery
eyes, and take thee by the
throat. No torment of
tenne thousand tyrants
like unto it. Doe but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
in what feare
and dread sometimes
thou seemest to be, when
in a sleepe or vision, a
glimpse of hell flashings
are presented unto thee,
oh how thou strivest and
strugglest, how thou cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and ravest with paine?
Nay, how glad art thou
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:11602:89"/>
thou awakest and findest
it to bee but a dreame,
how thou tellest thy
friend as much as thou
canst, (but alas, nothing
in respect of what thou
feltest) what thinkest
thou this to be? Certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the groveling of the
Conscience, stirred up by
Sathan of purpose to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelme
the godly, to
solicite to despaire, and
in the wicked to torment
them before their time;
yet in respect of God, a
most friendly admonition
for by this a man is suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in a vision to see and
feele the torment of hell,
to know the price of
Christs blood, to labour
by all meanes possibly to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:11602:89"/>
make sure his election. In
the wicked also it hath
this use. I could never
have thought it possible
for a mortall man to have
beene capable of that
measure of distresse, had
not the Lord in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
for the further subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
also of my bedlame
flesh, suffered mee some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to behold and feele
the flashings of hell
through his grace, causing
me as a child to be stilled
by the view of fearefull
beasts. If then in a dream,
or in a mans life time
there may bee such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
horror, that it
may cause the eyes to
stare, the tongue to rave,
the haire to stand an end:
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:11602:90"/>
How much more hideous
will it be when really and
in deede with perfect
knowledge &amp; sense broad
waking, we shall feele the
strokes of the Almighty,
the terrours of God shall
lay hold of us. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
whereof, in the
name of God, as you ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your eternall welfare,
enter into the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of your selves, and
discerne of your estates
whether they bee carnall
or no; cry out for the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
you heare what the
Holy Ghost saith, <hi>If you
walke after the flesh, ye shall
dye,</hi> How strangely doth
the sentence of <hi>Corporall
death</hi> appall a man though
pronounced by a wretch
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:11602:90"/>
like himselfe, and shall
not the doome of <hi>death e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,</hi>
given out by the
<hi>Holy Ghost</hi> at all astonish
you?</p>
               <p>Oh let not Sathan har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
your hearts, <hi>resist the
devill, and he will flye from
thee:</hi> It is a <hi>Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and a <hi>promise;</hi> What
faire warnings doth God
give unto men by <hi>himselfe</hi>
and <hi>Ministers,</hi> by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Spirit, and
checkes of our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from time to time,
and shall we bee so voide
of grace as to make our
selves a booty for <hi>Sathan,</hi>
to stand still while he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
us of our lives and
soules and all? Me thinks
reason should something
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:11602:91"/>
prevaile with us in things
so neerely concerning our
best good: But alas, a
hardened heart like <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs,</hi>
a flint, an adamant,
a marble spirit: no admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
will serve its turn,
where grace is wanting,
no impression takes any
roote: Men will make
triall and then beleeve. A
feareful experience this is,
thou maist first try in an
earthly cause and then be
warned; but from hell
thou canst not returne.
Remember <hi>Dives,</hi> credit
not the multitude, <hi>Olde
Tophet is wide and large,</hi>
humble thy selfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Away with this glozing

then this sinne;
it deprives a man of true

his heart, and fills
him with such inward

not looke God in the face
with any comfort.</p>
               <p>The deeds of the body.</p>
               <p>The meaning of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>holy Ghost</hi> is not, that wee
should cut off the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

(like many a dissembling
hypocrite which hath the
gift of restraining his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
that they breake
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:11602:96"/>
not out) but that wee
should kill sinne at the
heart and in the cradle,
then shall wee make sure
worke and never hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
stand in feare. The

that will crucifie thy <hi>olde
man</hi> and give him his
deaths wound, be weake
in thy selfe, and strong in
the Lord, and through his
might thou shalt be more

encreases, the power of
corruption will decay and
languish; this fires the
heart with such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
love to God,
that in comparison of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
it contemneth
the whole world besides.
It puts into us both cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

nor dread the might

In the affaires of this life
we love to excell, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip
others: and in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion to bee
dead and lumpish, is it not
abominable? would we
raigne with the Saints

with them now? receive
the price and not runne
the race? divide the

when a man considers,

what hast thou in heaven

What is to be dreaded but

with the adversary,
not able to maintaine the

               <p>For Christians (whilest
they are here) are not
wholly <hi>flesh,</hi> nor wholly
<hi>spirit,</hi> but a part of each:
God hath placed in our
bodies <hi>two</hi> inmates of
contrary dispositions, <hi>two</hi>
strangers of divers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and qualities (not in
the highest degree, for
then they would utterly
expell one another, but)
in a remisse ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, which
causeth this bickering and
skirmishing in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man.</p>
               <p>Now whereas every
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:11602:102"/>
one whose understanding
is renewed, seeth the drift
of his <hi>flesh</hi> (however tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the deceit thereof
he doth not alwaies feele
it) give mee leave to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
some few directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
wherby he may come
to have his corruptions
subdued, and temptations
vanquished, that they tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
not over his spirit
to the disquiet of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
               <p>That which I shall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
commend to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Christian, is, that hee
buckle about him the
<hi>compleat armour</hi> of God;<note place="margin">Ephes. 6.</note>
wee must not fly away.
from Sathan; a run-away
never makes a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:11602:103"/>
Some sins indeed are
best conquered by flying,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.</note>
but from sathan it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
possible nor lawfull to
fly. However stand it out,
what if we quake? better
tremble every veine than
sinne, better die in the
place than fly from the
place. <hi>Resist the devill and
he will fly from you:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.</note> we are
sure to conquer if wee
keepe our ground. Sathan
will play his part to hold
his hold, and will never
<hi>out</hi> unlesse hee be forced.
When a man comes to
abhor his lusts, then hee
gives sinne its deaths
wound. It is the nature of
sin not to be driven away
without force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
A few angry lookes
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:11602:103"/>
and sharp words will not
doe it: you may rate away
your dog, but sinne is not
so easie removed, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in many who will
speake bitterly against
their lusts, calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<hi>beast,</hi> and <hi>wretch,</hi> but
presently they returne to
their former courses. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thou hast therefore to do
with sinne, have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
fight against it
with all thy might, never
leave till thou hast got the
heart bloud of it out; so
much as thou sparest sin,
so much thou hurtest thy
selfe. <hi>Saul</hi> spared <hi>Agag,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note>
but it was his ruine; and if
thou sparest sinne it will
cost thee the Kingdome
of heaven: kill therefore
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:11602:104"/>
thy sinnes or they will kill
thee. It is a case of life and
death; bee carefull, old
wounds must have strong
medicines. What adoe
have wee to bring under
our unruly lusts? hee that
favours these let him want
favour: we weede our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
and are ever weed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
sins are ill weeds and
grow apace: our hearts
are a step-mother to <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
and a natural mother
to <hi>vice,</hi> therefore bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
dealing with it. The
Captaine that batters the
enemies fort a day or
two, and then gives over,
gives the more courage to
his enemy, and loses his
labour. In this life thou
shalt never want some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:11602:104"/>
to be mortified. Hast
thou begun to repent? ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
give over so long as
thou hast a heart to sigh
for thy sinnes. <hi>Sathan</hi> that
strong man will not yeeld
possession suddenly; looke
how much power wee
get to resist sinne, so
much power Sathan lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth;
there is never a
prayer wee make, nor act
of resisting that wee doe
use, but gives the devill a
knock, and sin a mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
blow, by fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our lusts; what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wee see and feele at
first, wee doe and shall
conquer corruption at
last.</p>
               <p>Repell evill motions at
their first onset, if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:11602:105"/>
at the beginning the
worke is halfe done, wee
shall find Sathan a <hi>coward,</hi>
but if wee resist not wee
shall find him a <hi>lyon;</hi> wee
must trust neither our
selves nor sathan with any
temptation. Begin as soon
as the temptation begins
to peepe, and where sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
begins doe thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
despise not the least
sin, a small wound may kil
a man in time, little gashes
make way for greater. If
the enemy assault one
way, and the garrison de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
another way, the
towne is lost. Sathan will
try his skill, and doe his
uttermost to prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, why should wee
not then improve our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:11602:105"/>
to make head against
him? we may preserve our
selves from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by him, though
we cannot utterly subdue
him. There is no possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of remaining safe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
resistance; they are
much deceived who think
though they have no spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
armour upon them
they may rest secure.</p>
               <p>Alas what can a naked
man doe? hee can no
more free himselfe from
the power of the devill,
than a poore silly lambe
from a roaring <hi>lyon:</hi> If we
bee foyled the fault is our
owne, for God gives us
means to stand fast; Who
would not be kept from
spiritual wounds &amp; hurts,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:11602:106"/>
from eternall bondage to
sin and sathan?</p>
               <p>2. Beware of <hi>pride,</hi>
swelling in the body is
dangerous, so is it in the
soule; when a man pleases
himselfe with his owne
weldoing, his heart is
soone puffed up. Hee that
thinkes to stand by his
owne strength shall sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
fall; the weakest
shall be able to overcome
their greatest enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under-propped of the
Lord. In every strong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
we must look for
supply from above. It is
dangerous to looke for
that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our selves, which
wee must have from
Christ. All our strength
lies in him, as <hi>Sampsons</hi> did
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:11602:106"/>
in his <hi>haire,</hi> therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
spirits are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
the best. Nothing
is stronger than <hi>humility,</hi>
that goeth out of it selfe,
or weaker than <hi>pride</hi> that,
resteth upon its owne
bottome. Sathan knowes
that nothing can prevaile
against Christ, or those
that relye upon him,
therefore hee labours to
keepe men in selfe depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy.</p>
               <p>If you would in truth
mortifie sinne, represent
it to your thoughts as the
most hurtfull, hatefull and
most loathsome thing in
the world, and represent
to your minde the obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Gods will, as the
most sweete, profitable,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:11602:107"/>
and excellentest thing
whatsoever, and then
you cannot but shunne
the one and embrace the
other: for,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Sinne is the onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

he hates nothing at

Now what a bedlam is
hee who willingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
any sinne, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

attended with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite

of hell must of necessity
be suffered; bee suffered
either by the party him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Sinne is the most filthy
thing in the world; even
fowler than the foulest

him a devill and sunke

maketh a thing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
is it selfe much more
evill, the <hi>Sunne</hi> lightens

it is that in <hi>Scripture</hi> it is

How are the bodies and

               <p>It is likewise very infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

corrupting every

first sinne that ever the
Sunne saw, was so preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with soule-killing
poyson, that it polluted
all the sonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Adam</hi> that ever
were since: At the first
breaking out thereof it
suddenly blasted (as it
were) both heaven and
earth, staining the beauty
of the one and the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the other, so as
from that houre the <hi>whole
creation hath groaned</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the same. If but one
sinne be doted upon and
delighted in, like a lumpe
of <hi>leaven</hi> it sowres all the

               <p>Yea, it is the greatest

But what saith a Father;
though wee thinke <hi>hell</hi> to
be the forest of all evills,
yet I thinke it is farre bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer
and more grievous
to offend Christ, then to
bee tormented with the

bee worth ten thousand

               <p>Who art thou that lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

Oh let the consideration

whose conscience is sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?
and yet how busie

Certainely, a

they should bee utterly

is hee that hath a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
stirring him upon
the least sinne, that will
awake at the least blow;
and performe its office.
<hi>David</hi> could have no

did but cut off the lappe
of <hi>Sauls garment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 24. 10.</note> and his
heart smote him and

<hi>Lord I have sinned exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,

very foolishly.</hi> Had his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

for mercy? Never there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
turne thine eyes
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beholding <hi>that</hi> which
conscience offers to thy

doth nothing of <hi>it selfe,</hi>
but by speciall authority
and commissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from God,
whose <hi>deputy</hi> it is.</p>
               <p>Yet it is possible to
turne that which of it self
is a blessing, into a curse:
It is a blessing to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a faithfull <hi>Ministery,</hi>
yet if a man bee not a <hi>doer</hi>
of the word, but a <hi>hearer</hi>
onely, he may increase his
owne judgement thereby.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:11602:112"/>
When men come to the
<hi>Ordinance,</hi> their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
are many times
wrought upon more
strongly than they would,
now it is good simply for
the conscience thus to run
and it is a token of Gods
great love unto man to
furnish his minde with
such a reflecting faculty
upon himselfe. But here
lyes the mischiefe, many
deale with their <hi>conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
as rich men doe with
an earnest beggar, or as
great men with an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
petitioner, whom
they will make as if they
did not heare, and passe
along by without regard,
when their heart smites
they will not answere,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:11602:112"/>
when it brings sinne to
their sight, they turne
their heads aside and will
not behold it. If they find
by experience that when
they are alone their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
use to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, they furnish
themselves with vain and
wretched company, such
as wil be sure to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
no leisure to speak.
If the word of God any
whit awakens them and
stirres up <hi>conscience</hi> to doe
its office, they thrust it
from their remembrance
by worldly thoughts and
cares, or sleepe it out that
they may not be disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
The poore consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
must bee conscience
off till <hi>another time,</hi> (as
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:11602:113"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> was when hee dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

teach to decline and
shun the workings of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
upon sinfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
By which meanes
that which in it selfe is a
great blessing, becomes a
wonderfull curse unto
them, the using of <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
in this unkinde man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
is the next way to
move the Lord to silence
it for ever. Look as God
dealeth with whole so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
of men in taking

them, when it is not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened

hee with particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in striking a dumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:11602:113"/>
upon their <hi>conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
when the voice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

therefore to its secret
checkes and smitings,
though men will not bee
brought to <hi>repetition</hi> of
sermons in their <hi>families,</hi>
yet they have a repeater
in their bosomes, that will
be at private repetition
with the in spite of their
teeths, and tell them, This
is not according to that
you have beene taught,
you have beene reproved
and convinced of this sin
in the publike Ministery,
why doe you not leave it?
for shame reforme this
pride, hypocrisie, lying,
swearing, formality, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
courses will bring
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:11602:114"/>
true peace at last, use them
to purpose, rest not in
outside shewes, without
the power and life of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.
How many times
doth conscience presse us
to repentance and better
obedience? How often
doth it startle us in our
postings to hell, and call
upon us to settle to ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
our lives? <hi>Conscience</hi>
speakes to us, as the Lord
to <hi>Ionah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jonah 4. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>doest thou well to
be angry?</hi> Dost thou wel
to be thus carnall and
earthly, thus eager upon
the world, thus cold and
indifferent in holy duties?
conscience gives privy
nips and secret checks. It
1. points with the finger
and gives direction, if it
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:11602:114"/>
be neglected, it smites
with the fist and gives
correction.</p>
               <p>Therefore if ever thou
desirest that sinne should
dye, and grace flourish in
thy heart, despise not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
when it speaketh;
doth it presse thee to any

&amp;c. in any case em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
his counsels. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to this preacher
whom thou canst not sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of partiality or ill

suspected to be set on by
others. Doth it chide and
reproch thee of thy waies?
doth it punctually arrest
thee of thy particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:11602:115"/>
much lesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend

thy selfe as fast as that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses,
acknowledge thy

covenant with thy con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>science
a full and speedy
reformation. If this were
done, how soone would
Sathans kingdome be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished,
and all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
weakned in us.</p>
               <p>But alas, how few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the voice of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
or once hearken to
it? the very want of this
sets open a floodgate of
wickednesse in the world.
If men cannot stop con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
mouth, they will
at least stoppe their own
eares. If <hi>Conscience</hi> offer
to be talking with them,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:11602:115"/>
they shuffle it off till their

thee loose to thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and it shall have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

How much better is it to
be willing to hearken to
the voice of conscience

w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> Christ hath made for

he was not, and what ever

if <hi>Sathan</hi> beat mee may a

in my stead hath beaten
him all to peeces? I have

in my head: In Christ
my <hi>Captaine</hi> hee is a van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished

makes his victory ours,
and sets <hi>him</hi> against every
tentation; we are not so

as Sathan is in the

                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 4.</note>
because it makes

victory. A Christian is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
safe, except he can by
faith lay fast hold on
Christ, and set up him and
his power against the
gates of hell and powers
of darknesse. Faith must
have one to side with it
against Sathan, who hath
absolute command over
Sathan. If Christ doe but
say the word, the Devil is
soone said, and his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
die. To him then
who is our refuge and
strength let us repaire in
all perplexities, by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to our selves by a

him our sword and buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:
Say, I of my selfe am

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:11602:117"/>
or subdue any
fleshly lust or corruption
whatsoever, but in Christ
made mine by <hi>faith</hi> I am
strong and can doe all

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 7.</note> Beleeve then that

thou shalt overcome; war

and nothing else, because

can doe no good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the temptation is
<hi>spirituall</hi> and reason car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
a naturall thing hath

beside, <hi>Reason</hi> is a

secret friend to Sathan,
and takes part with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our selves. Can a
man conquer the devill
with a wisedome that is
divellish, that hath him for
its damme? downe with
flesh and bloud then, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with our owne wit,
let faith doe all, else it will
doe nothing. <hi>Faith</hi> never
workes so well, as when it
works alone; it is no more
but beleeve the promise
and Sathan is gone.</p>
               <p>If Christians bee not
perswaded that God will
mortifie their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they will very much
at their manifold slips, be
off and on, and coldly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace

Alas, our owne strength
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:11602:118"/>
is too weake for the work
of holinesse, to represse
and vanquish the lusts of
our rebellious hearts,
which are by nature and
custome so deepely pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
with sinne. If wee
have not faith to beleeve
that God will aide and
blesse our endeavours and
doe the whole worke for
us, what courage can we
have to goe about it?
What shameful foyles and
repulses shall we sustaine
in it. Hee will manfully
fight against his lust, that
is assured of victory from
God in the end. It is a
great heartning to resist
evill, or to doe any good
duty, when wee beleeve
God will be with us, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:11602:118"/>
helpe us therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> acquaints a man
with his emptinesse of
grace, how unable hee is
to crucifie his inordinate
affections, or to repaire
the decayed image of
God in him, and that he is
in a wofull case, unlesse
the Lord put to his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.
What profits pardon
of sinne, to one that lyes
under the power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of sinne? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a true beleever fights
couragiously against his
corruptions, and cryeth
instantly to the Lord for
helpe: though the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
be never so hot, hee
will not yeelde, because
hee apprehends victory;
for grace doth flow from
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:11602:119"/>
Christ into our hearts
more or lesse, as our faith
is weaker or stronger,
though we have no grace
of our selves, yet if wee
cleave to him wee shall
want none. Doth the
streaming fountaine deny
water to the thirsty tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller?
No more doth
Christ to the empty par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

him. Hee is an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing

Hee filleth the

Hee that joyneth

wee give stings and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons

The <hi>heathen</hi> could say, he

to his owne body, and
shall not our spirits bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated
to a higher pitch

having God for our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

This flesh of ours
doth us more mischiefe

alas, hee could never hurt
us, were we not first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed

It was this that

pierced our Saviours

moveth men daily to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie

with such a malicious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy?
shall we not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with implacable

shall we not rather take

Our <hi>spirit</hi> is

The more familiar <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pson</hi>

Oughtest thou not much

that so thou mayest not

doth not God call upon

Thinke not the Christian

that thou art now out of

it is not therefore suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:11602:123"/>
to make good onsett,
nor yet to hold out the

not what conflicts
have beene endured, as

but bewaile the naked

experienced Christians
find the contrary.<note place="margin">Bellum est, non trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans.</note> Our

carnall motions will
rise in our hearts; though
wee cut them off they
spring out againe; though
thou quench them, they
are kindled againe, will
thou, nill thou, they soone
returne; they may be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
but cannot bee roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

parties (the <hi>flesh</hi> and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit)
of so contrary disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
within us. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
wee should ever
walk after the one, unlesse

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:11602:125"/>
of reforming it, and
watchest over those things
which are most pleasing
to it, this cannot proceed
but from a worke of grace
in thee; for Nature is a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of it selfe, and seekes
by all means its own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation;
when a man is
come to this, that he doth
not approve his sinfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
nor willingly
give way unto it, but stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
rather which way to
curbe and restraine the
same, it is a manifest signe
of some higher hand, by
which the flesh shall bee
more and more over ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
I doubt not but a man
after there is some change
wrought in him by grace,
may in some particulars
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:11602:126"/>
receive a foyle by his
owne corruptions, and by
that law of his members,
which fights and rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

hardly may a man say hee
is truly changed, unlesse

and have it otherwise

               <p>Grace cannot stand with
the regiment of sin: That

truly wrought, desires to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:11602:126"/>
bee furnished with the
compleat armour of God,
that he may resist the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill;
the strength and bent
of his will and affections
are for God and goodnes;
hee chooseth holinesse
with a full purpose and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to walke in it; he
turnes from his former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
with a detestation of
them, and leaves them
with a resolution never
to take them up againe;
he daily prayes, and cryes
earnestly to God for
strength against corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and wisheth, <hi>O that my

I might keepe thy statutes.</hi>
He is not for God to day,

Hee is no <hi>Morning</hi> Saint,

and <hi>evening</hi> Devil, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires

A Gracious heart

to thee for <hi>his sake</hi>
whom it resembles, and
the other loathsome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it opposes the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty?
Doest thou o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
God out of a <hi>love</hi> of
goodnesse, seeing a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the wayes of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
being humbled
when thou hast done thy
best, that thou canst bring
no more glory to him, &amp;
dost thou love righteous
men for righteousnesse
sake? Is thy service rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and cheerefull, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repining and delay?
Canst thou be content to
obey against profit, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
credit, liberty, ease,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:11602:130"/>
the liking of the world, or
carnall friends, preferring
Gods commandements <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi>
all things, yea life it
selfe?<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 25</note> Art thou sensible
of the dishonour done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and more vexed
for <hi>that,</hi> than for any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
or injury offered to
thy self? it is a good signe.</p>
               <p>But art thou quick sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the faults of o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers,
and indulgent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thine owne, it is an
ill symptome.</p>
               <p>The best men are most
severe against themselves,
and tender over others.
A gracious heart dislikes
sinne in any, but in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
most of all. He is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
backward in censuring
others, but exceeding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:11602:130"/>
in accusing himself.
None can say so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, but he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to say much more. He
loveth goodnesse in the
greatest enemie, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
sin even in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
friend.</p>
               <p>Art thou conscionable
of the least offence, as wel
as the greatest, cherishing
an universall hatred of all
sinne in thy soule, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
secret or open, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception, and cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a constant purpose
and resolution in nothing
willingly to sinne against
God; but whatsoever thou
knowest to be a sin thou
wilt not deliberately doe
it for all the world, at all
times, and in all places,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:11602:131"/>
though no eye sees thee,
and it may be beneficiall
unto thee? Here is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
signe that <hi>grace</hi> hath
gotten the upper hand,
when as thou preferrest
<hi>vertue</hi> before <hi>vice,</hi> even
then when in humane
reason, vertue will be the
loser, and vice the gainer.
An unsound conscience is
large, and can swallow
downe any thing; the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
conscience is strait,
and the least bone, though
but such as are in little fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
will sticke in her
throat. Neglect of smaller
matters may justly bring
our obedience in greater
matters in suspition; the
same God that requires
our fidelity in the <hi>one,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:11602:131"/>
it also in the other.
A gracious heart, is like
the <hi>eye,</hi> troubled with the
least more, &amp; certainly <hi>hee
that is unjust in a little, will
bee also unjust in much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is the uprightnesse of
others of Gods servants,
more highly esteemed by
thee than thine owne?
Doest thou see greater
excellencies in them than
in thy selfe? Feelest thou
no bottome in other
mens praises, when thy
heart tells all is not well
within. An humble Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
hides himselfe in the
closet, and as in prayer, so
in all good duties shuts
the doore, he is much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with a sense of his
owne infirmities, resting
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:11602:132"/>
it selfe wholly upon the
power of God, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
in her weaknesse,
and is many times more
humbled, for the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and defilements of
good workes, than for
some workes simply evill
in themselves; he desires
to be good, rather then to
be thought so.</p>
               <p>Are the sinnes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and the sorrowes of
the Church, as sensible
and bitter to thy soule, as
thine owne? Canst thou
forget thy selfe, and thy
particular businesse to lay
these to heart?</p>
               <p>Doest thou rejoyce al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to be crossing and
thwarting thy selfe in
those succours, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:11602:132"/>
of sinne which thy
corruption suggests?</p>
               <p>Is that experience
which thou hast of <hi>sinne,</hi>
and of <hi>grace,</hi> no dead but
a stirring experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
thee to duty, and
mortifying corruption in
thee, so as not onely
<hi>knowledge,</hi> but conscience
also swayes thee to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
duties? and art thou
as carefull to persevere in
grace, as once to imbrace
it, these are good signes.</p>
               <p>Cheere up therefore
thy drooping spirit, the
Lord by the power of his
grace hath tooke possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thee. Nothing but
grace alone, is able to
keep the love of sinne out
of the <hi>heart,</hi> though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:11602:133"/>
some other
thing may keepe it out of
thy <hi>hand.</hi> Civility and
hypocrisie may a little
snib sinne, or bid it for a
while stand aside, and
give way to better things,
but it is onely grace that
strikes this <hi>Goliah</hi> dead. It
is onely the spirit which
subdues the <hi>flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But wee must know,
there is a great deale of
difference, betweene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
of sinne, through
the strength and power of
grace, and for other car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ends and by-respects;
for an hypocrite may
sometimes forsake sinne,
(not out of any love to
God, or hatred of ill, but)
because sinne leaves him,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:11602:133"/>
happily hee feares it will
bee some losse or discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to him, or else fit
meanes and opportunity
of committing it, serve
not his turne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee forbeares. It is
nothing for a man to bee
chast, where there is no
provocation to uncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Here was the tryall
of <hi>Iosephs</hi> integrity, that
though the occasion were
offered by his owne <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse</hi>
to doe the deed, in
such secresie and security
that no eye perceived it,
yet the feare of God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verruled
him. Many seem
to bee meeke and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
men, while they are
well dealt with, but let
some injury bee offered
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:11602:134"/>
and the contrary will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare:
That wee are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
which wee are in
temptation; Examine thy
heart then in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
what is the ground of
that divorce which seems
to bee betwixt thee, and
thy olde lusts? If it flowes
from any thing in the
world, but the love of
God and goodnesse,
thou art in a wretched
conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be thy thoughts
of thy selfe never so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
               <p>Art thou one whose
heart likes well of sinne,
though thou canst not or
darest not commit it? Art
thou one who when thou
art convinced and rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of thy failings, thy
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:11602:134"/>
heart riseth against the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe,
though for thy
credit, and profit sake,
thou seemest to welcome,
and thankfully entertaine
the same. I tell thee thou
art in a dangerous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thou hast but weake
and slender evidence of
the spirits prevailing in
thy heart.</p>
               <p>But why saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle

                  <hi>yee shall dye,</hi>
and not, yee shall be <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;</hi>
in as much as that is
chiefly meant?</p>
               <p>Because the Spirit of
God would drive men
from sinne,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> by that which
is most fearefull, to their
present apprehension; the
remembrance of <hi>death</hi>
doth more forcibly move
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:11602:135"/>
the minde, than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance
of <hi>Hell,</hi> though
hell bee a thousand times
more grievous then death
for our affection is moved
according to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the thing: that
which most wayes is
knowne, affecteth most,
wee know <hi>hell</hi> onely by
<hi>faith,</hi> but we know death
to bee fearefull by reason
and sense, because we feel
it growing upon us eve<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y
day.</p>
               <p>The opposition made
here by the Apostle
warnes us, that a necessity
lyes upon us to mortifie
our sinfull lusts. It stands
upon our lives, unlesse
we slay sinne, sinne will
not faile to slay us. It is
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:11602:135"/>
like a Serpent in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
which cannot live,
but by sucking out that
blood whereby wee live.
What pittiful folly is this?
we hate them which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
our bodily life, we es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew
them by all meanes
that would spoile us of
our worldly goods, onely
wee cannot hate Sathan
to the death, who seekes
by sinne to spoyle us of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life.</p>
               <p>That same commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was given to
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Every sin is as the forbidden fruit.</note> 
                  <hi>If ye eate
of the forbidden tree ye shall
dye,</hi> is in effect here given
to us all, <hi>If you live after
the flesh you shall dye;</hi> let not
us make an exception
where God hath made
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:11602:136"/>
none; every sinne to us
is that forbidden tree to
<hi>Adam,</hi> if wee meddle
with it, we shall finde no
better fruit than he found:
Bitter death growes upon
the pleasant tree of sinne,
<hi>for the wages of sinne is
death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is therefore a point
of great wisdome to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
betweene the <hi>deceit</hi>
of sinne, and the <hi>fruit</hi> of
sinne. Hee that would
rightly know the face of
sinne when it stands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, to tempt him,
let him looke backe to the
taile of that sinne which
he hath already commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the sting which
it leaves behinde it. The
perishing pleasures of sin
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:11602:136"/>
are paid home with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
perdition; it is
done in a moment, but
brings forth <hi>death,</hi> and
breeds a worme that will
never die. Men may sleep
in their sinne, but their
damnation sleepes not.</p>
               <p>Every mans state in
this life, is a prediction of
that condition which hee
shall have hereafter. <hi>Hee
that soweth to the flesh, shall
of the flesh reape corruption,
but hee that soweth to the
spirit, shall reape immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and life.</hi> No man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to heaven, or hell,
but by the way that leads
thereunto. A wicked life
is a thorow-way to the
place of darknesse. But a
godly life is the direct
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:11602:137"/>
path to salvation. <hi>As the

commonly falls on that
side, which did most
bend towards the earth
before: if the greatest
growth of our affections
and actions, spring out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the spirit, no doubt,
we shall fall on the right
hand and be blessed; but
if otherwise they grow
downeward, and thou
live after the <hi>flesh,</hi> assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thou shalt fall on the
left hand and perish irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably.</p>
               <p>Wee shall not be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
according to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

our general course of life;

               <p>But seeing they who

every ungodly person is
<hi>now</hi> dead, but yet a more
fearefull death abides
them. For albeit they be
dead in sinne, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the favour of the
Creator, yet the vaine
comforts of the <hi>creature</hi>
doe so bewitch them, that
they know not how mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and wretched they
are, but when the last sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

bee pronounced against
them, they shall not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>Which when I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
I cannot but deplore

Oh how is the <hi>Spirit</hi>

then? be not dismayed,
thy future peace will
more then recompense
thy present trouble. What
availes a little outward

redeeme a moment of

raignes. What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of these fearefull out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes,
and desperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
of Christians,
concerning their spiritual
estate? Whence is it that
they taking Satans part in
accusing and condemning
themselves, do utter such
dolefull exclamations as
these; when conscience is
throughly awakened.</p>
               <p>Alas, I have most wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedly
spent the prime
and strength of mine age
in vanity and pleasure, in
lewdnesse and lust: The
best of my time hath been
wofully wasted in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sathan and serving
my selfe, and therefore
though I be weary of my
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:11602:140"/>
former wayes and looke
backe upon them with a
trembling heart, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
spirit, yet I am affraid
God will never vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to cast his eye of
compassion upon my
soule. Though I have
beene a professour long,
yet many times my heart
is full of doubting when
I call to minde the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousnesse
of my unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
life, and see
since I was enlightened
and should have behaved
my selfe in forwardnesse
and fruitfulnesse for God
answerable to my former
folly and licentiousnesse
in evill, so many slips and

and such weake distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:11602:140"/>
discharging of duties
commanded both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God and man, that
my very spirits sink with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

I reach out the hand of
my faith to fetch some
speciall promise into my
soule, for refreshing and
comfort, comparing advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
my owne vilenesse
and nothingnesse, with
the riches of mercy and
grace shining therein, I
am overwhelmed with
admiration, and thinke
with my selfe, how is it
possible that this should
bee? Can such glorious
things belong to such a
wretch and worme as I
am? I cannot deny but
there is mercy enough in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:11602:141"/>
God, but for me, such a
notorious wicked liver as
I am, mercy for me, surely
it cannot be. Alas; I have
beene no ordinary sinner,
my corruptions have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
me beyond the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies
of the vilest crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
you can name, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normity
of my wayes
have set an infamous
brand upon mee in the
sight of the world, besides
those secret pollutions
and sinfull practises which
no eye ever beheld save
God alone. Had I not
beene extreamely outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
and gone on thus
with a high hand, I might
have had some hope, but
now all expectation failes
