            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I Deſire thee to lay aſide prejudice, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>R. Bridgman</hi> is offended at the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Confeſſion of <hi>D. S.</hi> in the Body of his Pamphlet, calling it <hi>Malapart Pragmatical</hi> ſtyle, (Pope like) without the Conſent of the Church: Who this <hi>D. S.</hi> is may not be eaſie to judge; however, I do not find <hi>D. S.</hi> do joyn with any inraged Enemy, or Adverſary, nor is he mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious againſt any that have laid down their Lives in defence of the Bleſſed Truth, but for the clearing of all ſuch, and that none ſhould be led aſide by ſuch who cover and cloak groſs Errors. And yet <hi>R. B.</hi> in his fifth Page is offended with <hi>D. S.</hi> and here he ſays, he vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies ſome, or a part of the ſame Society, and that with denying Him that was born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> to be the Chriſt the Saviour of the World; it is evident that this <hi>R. B.</hi> is of the ſame ſtamp with his Brethren in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> or at leaſt-wiſe a Cloaker of thoſe groſs Errors, as <hi>Samuel Jennings, Coock</hi> and <hi>Loyd,</hi> and the reſt of that Faction and yet this <hi>R. B.</hi> hath the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Page the ninth, where he cites the Yearly-meeting Paper, (Mark) <hi>if there be any groſs Errors,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>held by any Profeſſing the Truth in</hi> America, <hi>ſuch Parſons ought to be admoniſhed,</hi> &amp;c. And yet I have not heard of any Paper of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that <hi>S. Jennings,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe of that Faction has given forth ſince their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65794:3"/>
Admonition, nor <hi>R. B.</hi> nor his Twenty four Brethren againſt them, but makes a great out-cry they are wronged, and ſcandalized, but they will not let us know in what, but it's the Duty of all true Chriſtians to clear themſelves from Errors, and not to Cloak ſuch damnable Errors that no Proteſtant Society in Chriſtendom would tolerate, as is made manifeſt in Print al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and there teſtified againſt by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Quakers,</hi> and <hi>R. B.</hi> ſeems to be offended with <hi>D. S.</hi> for deſiring any to pray to God to turn them from their Errors, how Unchriſtian this <hi>R. B.</hi> ſhews himſelf (is well to be noted) it is wonderful to me to ſee <hi>R. B's</hi> ſtock of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in cloaking his Brethrens groſs Errors, and in charging <hi>D. S.</hi> upon no better Proof than a perhaps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when he muſt if he be ingenuous, confeſs <hi>S. Jennings</hi> and many more are proved Guilty of ſuch groſs Errors, that no Proteſtant Society would tolerate; but the main drift of <hi>R. B.</hi> is to blind the Innocent, and cover the guilty; <hi>p. 7th. R. B.</hi> makes bold to tell his Reader, <hi>there is no inſtance produced wherein</hi> G. Whitehead <hi>has been either weak or wicked, which to cover and cloak many groſs Errors muſt be.</hi> Either he would make the world believe he had not read <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads</hi> Writings of Contention, or elſe he juſtifies all what <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> has writ, or elſe cloakes and covers it: See <hi>G. Whitehead's</hi> Book, <hi>Judgment fixed,</hi> and ſee what Names he gives to thoſe that teſtifie againſt groſs Errors; not becoming any Chriſtian of Chriſt's making, and alſo <hi>R. B.</hi> in his ſeventh Page is offended with <hi>D. S.</hi> for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Light and Darkneſs are Beings,</hi> and thus ſays
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65794:3"/>
                  <hi>R. B. which as much beſpeaks his Skill in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, as the other does his Titled to Chriſtianity:</hi> finding <hi>R. B.</hi> having ſo little Skill in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy makes me ſave Paper on that head, and whereas <hi>R. B.</hi> ſeems to be offended at <hi>D. S.</hi> for his ſaying, <hi>if pleaſe God to put it into the Hearts of the Governours to burn all the Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Books,</hi> and then ſays he, <hi>no need of Emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</hi> I underſtand <hi>D. S.</hi> means ſuch Books that contain ſuch damnable Doctrine, as tend to the deſtroying the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and inſtead of <hi>R. B.</hi> and his Twenty four Brethren writing Emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, <hi>they endeavour to cloak all thoſe groſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> then <hi>R. B.</hi> goes on, <hi>and why muſt they be burnt, the Matter it ſeems is diſtateful,</hi> but it is evident groſs Errors are not diſtateful to <hi>R. B.</hi> if they were, he would not hugg them as he does: then he goes on, and calls all that teſtifie againſt groſs Errors, <hi>Apoſtats, and unruly Spirits, that like not to have their Fruits made manifeſt, and their Rebellion againſt the Light rebuked; and they that would have Books burnt, next ſtep would have the Authors burnt,</hi> but this is <hi>R. B.</hi> wanting Charity, to condemn groſs Errors that doth not follow, that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Authors to be burnt: at his way of arguing all the Proteſtant Societies that have condemned and teſtified againſt the Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (would burn their Bodies) and ſhould the Chriſtian <hi>Quakers</hi> tell <hi>R. B.</hi> and his Twenty four Brethren, that thoſe perſecuting <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Penſilvania;</hi> that Fined, and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned our Chriſtian Friends in that Province, next ſtep would burn their Bodies; our thoughts
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65794:4"/>
are that <hi>R. B.</hi> and his Twenty four Brethren would ſay we were very uncharitable. And now I ſhall return ſome of <hi>R. B's.</hi> own words upon him, in Page the ninth, <hi>but this</hi> D. S. (<hi>who in a Malapert Pragmatical ſtile, would be deemed the the Repreſentative of the true Chriſtian</hi> Quakers, <hi>is for Cenſuring and Excommunicating</hi> (Pope-like) <hi>without Conſent of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. I appeal to all ſober People, how <hi>R. B.</hi> do fret himſelf with the honeſt Confeſſion of <hi>D. S.</hi> But I perceive if <hi>D. S.</hi> his Book had been Licenſed by the Second days meeting, or by <hi>R. B.</hi> and his Twenty four Brethren, it would have met with much more favour, than now it has; as if nothing but what is tolerated by a certain Faction of ſome few pretended <hi>Quakers</hi> (whether that be not more like the Pope and his Councel.) That except we will believe as the Church believes, that is, receive ſuch groſs Errors, and damnable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines as no Proteſtant Society would tolerate, we muſt be called Apoſtates, and unruly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: the next thing that makes us admire is, how thoſe pretended <hi>Quakers</hi> as <hi>R. B.</hi> and his Twenty four Brethren come to aſſume that Power to themſelves; as the Title of a Church above the Chriſtian <hi>Quaker,</hi> and nothing muſt paſs currant except it come from ſome of their Meetings, or tolerated by them; but we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſome men will over-value themſelves, and to have no Charity towards them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; alſo <hi>R. B.</hi> ſeems greatly concerned for <hi>D. S.</hi> mentioning <hi>Joſiah Coal, J. Audland</hi> for their adoring <hi>G. Fox,</hi> it ſeems <hi>R. B.</hi> do eſpouſe all the groſs Errors, and his Twenty four Brethren;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65794:4"/>
But the Chriſtian <hi>Quaker</hi> utterly diſowns all Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and cannot aſcribe that Honour to a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man, which is due to our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, the Saviour of the world; <hi>R. B.</hi> would have done well to have told his Reader in what Book or Books thoſe blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Titles given to <hi>G. Fox</hi> had been vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I preceive <hi>R. B.</hi> and his Twenty four Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are Vindicators of thoſe Adorations given to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and herein is the true Chriſtian <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> diſtinguiſhed from the Apoſtate, the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth all Error, and the <hi>Apoſtate cloak and cover them.</hi> Then <hi>R. B.</hi> goes on and ſays, I need ſay the leſs to them (meaning Books) but what Books he tells not his <hi>Reader what thoſe Books are,</hi> and <hi>R. B.</hi> confeſſeth there may be ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Expreſſions in <hi>G. F.</hi> Writings, therefore he muſt grant it wants Emendations, and grants they were not well guarded, he have made a ſort of a blind Confeſſion, and by this, <hi>R. B.</hi> have a little Arraigned <hi>G. Fox</hi> as well as <hi>D. S.</hi> and <hi>F. Bugg;</hi> and now we will let the Reader un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what Authority the Holy Scriptures have with theſe men, ſee <hi>G.

So we have with brevity taken notice of what is material; the main end of <hi>R.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65794:6"/>
believe as the Church believes, and muſt take nothing for truth, but what ſuch as he and his Twenty four Brethren have ſtamped; but <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Bridgman,</hi> and his Twenty four Brethren, was not willing to tell their Reader, thoſe that had a hand in the yearly Meeting Paper left out part of <hi>G.

               <p>Now all this was left out in the 7th. page, ſo by this you may ſee, they would Exclude the Man Chriſt Jeſus being joyntly concerned in our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and yet <hi>R.

take much pains to refute him, (for undeniably is not a perhaps, or for ought I know) we would have the Reader well obſerve, that <hi>R.

Heaven, and had nothing of the Body of man in Heaven;</hi> and at another Meeting he ſaid, <hi>he had not learned that Leſſon, whether it was the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head or ſomething elſe, that Chriſt took of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that was nailed to the Croſs, Excluding the Man Chriſt Jeſus his Death, Reſurrection, Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Meditation for us in Heaven. J.

               <p>Alſo 19. Queries by way of a further Reply, to a Paper publiſhed by <hi>J. Vaughton, J. Feilde, Ch. Marſhal, Will. Bingly,</hi> and others; being in number Twenty four, and alſo to their Brother <hi>R. B.</hi> which make their number to be Twenty five. Seeing thou <hi>R. B.</hi> and thy Twenty four Brethren have taken upon you the Guilt of thoſe Errors, and horrid Blaſphemies of your Brethren char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on them by <hi>F. Bugg.</hi> we have here added theſe following Queries, deſiring you to anſwer them, or abandon the Name of <hi>Chriſtian Quaker,</hi> that you would ſeem to take on you, which cannot be allowed you by any rational Man, while you cover and cloak ſuch vile Errors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 1. How dared you eſpouſe thoſe groſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of <hi>Tho Fitzwater, R. Young,</hi> and <hi>T. Lloyd,</hi> viz. <hi>O God that died in us, and laid down thy Life in us, and took it up again; and that when Chriſt aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he was ſeparated from his Body, that Faith in Chriſt without us, as he died for our ſins, and roſe again, was not neceſſary to our Salvation.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> 2. Had it not been better for you, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have given out a Chriſtian Teſtimony againſt them, for their ſaid Blaſphemous Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and againſt <hi>S. Jennings</hi> and others Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>G. Keith, T. Budd,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Why do you not anſwer <hi>F. Buggs</hi> firſt Charge, who ſaith the Quakers denied him, <hi>Who was born of the Virgin Mary, who ſuffered Death upon the Croſs at Jeruſalem, who roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Third day, and aſcended into Heaven, in the ſight of the Galileans to be Chriſt the Saviour of the World.</hi> Seeing <hi>D. S.</hi> clears the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Quakers of this groſs Charge, it lyeth at your Door to clear your ſelves thereof if you are able.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 4. Why do you not anſwer his ſecond Charge, who ſay, <hi>They deny the Scriptures, by ſpeaking contemptuouſly of them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>D. S.</hi> have alſo cleared the Chriſtian Quakers thereof, therefore it lyeth at your Door, to clear your ſelves and others of your Brethren if you can.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 5. Why do you not anſwer <hi>F. B</hi>'s third Charge, who ſays, <hi>Their Teachers are Deceivers of the People, Favourers of Blaſphemy, and of differing Faith from the Apoſtles, Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and Bleſſed Martyrs and Excuſers of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that their Doctrine tends to overthrow the Chriſtian Faith. D. S.</hi> have cleared his Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Friends of this groſs Charge, therefore you are left to anſwer for your Selves and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:65794:9"/>Q. 6. Why do not you anſwer <hi>F. Buggs</hi> Charge againſt you, who accuſeth the Quakers for teaching, <hi>That the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, do not properly belong to the Body that ſuffered upon the Croſs at Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>D. S.</hi> condemns this Error on behalf of the Chriſtian Quakers, but you having taken it upon your ſelves, by blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>D. S.</hi> for ſo doing it lyeth now at your Door.</p>
               <p>Q. 7. Why do not you anſwer the ten Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, publiſhed by <hi>R. Hannay:</hi> your Champion <hi>T. Elwood,</hi> having not done it.</p>
               <p>Q. 8. Whether thou <hi>R. Bridgman,</hi> and thy Twenty four Brethren doth intend to follow the Footſteps of your Apoſtate Brethren in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> the Twenty eight falſe Judges, in condemning and denying of <hi>G. Keith,</hi> and his Chriſtian Friends; for, or becauſe of their Chriſtian Doctrine and Principles.</p>
               <p>Q. 9. Seeing ſome of you Twenty four Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers have confeſſed, that you had not read the Little Book ſigned by <hi>D. S.</hi> how dared you to Sign a Paper againſt it barely on Truſt, is not this believing as the Church believes <hi>Rome,</hi> like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 10. Is it not greater Preſumption in you to publiſh a Paper in order to make the Body of the Chriſtian Quakers equally Guilty of thoſe grand Errors with your ſelves; than for <hi>D. S.</hi> to clear the Body, and only blame the Guilty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65794:9"/>Q. 11. Whether you do approve (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to follow that Anti-Chriſtian Practice) of your Brethrens denying <hi>The Chriſtian Quakers,</hi> their Right of burying their Dead, as we hear was lately done in <hi>Southwark,</hi> by ſome of your Apoſtate Brethren, <hi>James Braithwait</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 12. Wherefore did you Twenty four Apoſtate <hi>Quakers,</hi> be ſo bold as to call the Sheet ſigned by <hi>D. S.</hi> a Libel, and yet doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to prove one Paragraph to be ſuch, doubtleſs ſome of you have Confidence enough to make Truth ſeem to be a Lye, and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Light, if your Maſter the D—l had but furniſhed you his Craft ſo to do.—</p>
               <p>Q. 13. Seeing thou <hi>R. B.</hi> have confeſſed in private, that thou haſt quibled, (in thy Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Pamphlet) had it not been rather more like a Chriſtian, for thee, and alſo for thy Twenty four Brethren, to have confeſt your own and Brethrens Errors, endeavouring to forſake the ſame; deſiring God's Forgiveneſs for Chriſt's ſake, than to continue to cover and cloak ſuch damnable Errors, as no Proteſtant Society will tollerate.</p>
               <p>Q. 14. Is not <hi>R. B.</hi> guilty of Envy, and Out-rage againſt <hi>D. S.</hi> For confeſſing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning thoſe groſs Errors, again <hi>R. B.</hi> in his Twelve and thirteenth Pages would inſinuate, that he is very Charitable to <hi>D. S.</hi> in that he, <hi>viz. D. S.</hi> do give cauſe to charge him, <hi>as que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65794:10"/>
a future Exiſtance, or Being from</hi> D. S'<hi>s. charitable ſaying of</hi> Iſ. Pennington, <hi>if that worthy Man were in being,</hi> &amp;c. now its evident <hi>D. S.</hi> could not mean any other Being but in this Life, unleſs this <hi>R. B. S.</hi> Divinity allow of Retraction, or Recantation in the Life immortal, which is erroneous, for although there be a future Being, yet no Being for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, <hi>&amp;c. R. B.</hi> ſays, <hi>That he may poſitively charge</hi> D. S. <hi>that he denies a future Exiſtance, is not this poſitively Unchriſtian in</hi> R. B. <hi>and may not we by the ſame rule Charge him to hold a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. 15. Art not thou <hi>R. Bridgman</hi> Guilty of Envy, for falſly charging (in thy Fifeteenth page) D. S. <hi>as wanting Chriſtianity, becauſe he confeſt</hi> G. Whitehead <hi>was a contentious Scribler, and Guilty of giving baſe and ſcurrilous Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> on no other Evidence ſays <hi>R. B. but that of</hi> F. B. <hi>but to prove this Envy and Folly of</hi> R. B's, <hi>let the Reader ſee for himſelf, the filthy Language of</hi> (R. B's. <hi>Elder</hi>) G. Whitehead <hi>given in his Book</hi> Judgment fixed, <hi>alſo ſee the</hi> Billings-gate Rhethorick, in a Book called <hi>The Accuſer of of the Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. allow <hi>R. B.</hi> his Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (<hi>viz. G.

               <p>Q. 16. Art not thou <hi>R. B.</hi> Guilty of Envy
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65794:10"/>
and Folly, as well as Lying and Prevertion, for affirming that Blaſphemy againſt Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> is a Sin that's not to be forgiven; pray let's know in thy next, the Chapter and Verſe in thy Scripture, <hi>where Sin againſt the Son of man is not to be forgiven,</hi> &amp;c. we know there is a Text that ſaith, <hi>The Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is not to be forgiven,</hi> Ergo <hi>R. B.</hi> mendax eſt.</p>
               <p>Q. 17. <hi>R. B.</hi> Art not thou Guilty of Envy and Madneſs, to cover and cloak thoſe Divine Attributes, or Blaſphemous Titles given to <hi>G. F.</hi> (by <hi>J. C.</hi> and <hi>J. A.</hi>) to ſatisfie the unprejudiced Reader we ſhall cite the Attributes given to <hi>G. F.</hi> (by <hi>J. C.</hi> and <hi>J. A</hi>) that he may ſee for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf what the Apoſtate <hi>Quaker</hi> is for covering and excuſing, and what the true Chriſtian <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> is for denying, <hi>viz.</hi> all Blaſphemy, and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, be it of what kind ſoever?</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Dear <hi>George Fox,</hi> whoſe Being and Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in the Power of the higheſt, in which thou rules and governs in Righteouſneſs, and thy Kingdom is eſtabliſhed in Peace, and the increaſe thereof is without end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dear and precious one, in whom my Life is bound up, my Strength is in thee, by thy Breathings I am nouriſhed, by thee my Strength is renewed, Bleſſed art thou for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore,—Bleſſed are all that injoy,—Life and Strength come from thee, Holy one,—reach unto me, that I may be ſtrengthned to ſtand in the mighty Power, and dread of the Lord,—daily do I find thy Preſence,—I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reign, but in thy dread for evermore,—

               </q>
               <p>Now behold what Confidence this <hi>R. B.</hi> hath to cover and excuſe his great Scholar, <hi>G. F.</hi> whom he ſaith, had ſome knowledge of the Hebrew tongue, which is here granted; but however, he had not underſtanding of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, therefore he could not underſtand <hi>tu nos</hi> and <hi>vos,</hi> but by Tradition, and ſome body paid enough for his underſtanding in the Hebrew, (Witneſs the Eighty pounds, and Dozen Bottles of Wine, as mentioned in the former part hereof) we preſume this cannot be an Argument of any good Breeding in <hi>R. B.</hi> to cover ſuch vile and groſs Wickedneſs; as he doth both in his great Scholar, <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>J. C.</hi> and <hi>J. A.</hi> who were manifeſt to be but weak and ignorant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in giving the aforeſaid Adorations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 18. R. Bridgman,</hi> is it not great Folly and Ignorance in thee, to quarrel with <hi>D. S.</hi> in thy Thirteenth page, (<hi>i. e. D. S</hi>'s.) <hi>Exhorting every Believer in Chriſt, and follower of him to bear his Image,</hi> &amp;c. may not this quarrelſome Spirit of <hi>R. B.</hi> be as well offended with holy <hi>David, for exhorting the Saints to praiſe the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. may not we according to his Sophiſtical way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſay to him, <hi>as if any were Saints, and did not praiſe the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and are not the Preachers
