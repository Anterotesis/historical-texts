            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Design of the following <hi>Treatise</hi> being to Instruct those, who are yet to learn, in the <hi>Principles</hi> of their <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> I shall not think it necessary to make any Apology for my Publishing of it. It is so proper a Part of our <hi>Ministerial Office,</hi> not only to <hi>Teach</hi> these Things, but to Use our Utmost Endeavours, to Inculcate them upon the Minds of those who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to our Charge; that we never more truly pursue the Business of our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, than when We are doing of it. And no One ought to make an <hi>Excuse</hi> for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, the Neglect of which would Need an <hi>Excuse,</hi> or rather would not admit of <hi>Any.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:33743:3"/>It has pleased God, to whose Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I desire in All Things to Submit my Self, to engage me in a Cure, in which 'tis next to Impossible, in the Ordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Teaching, to instruct All Those who belong to it. Neither will Our <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> Receive Them; nor can I hope, by any <hi>Private Application,</hi> effectually to supply what I am sensible must be Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in our <hi>Publick Ministration.</hi> To make up the Defects of Both, I knew no way so Ready, as to compose a Short <hi>Summary</hi> of what is most Necessary for Every <hi>Christian</hi> to know; and to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it in such Wise, that every One who pleases may partake of the Benefit of it. This I have done in the present <hi>Treatise:</hi> Which as it was design'd by me particularly for those of my <hi>Own Parish,</hi> for whose Instruction I am principally concern'd; so, to Them I must beg Leave, in a more Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Manner, to Recommend the Use of it. I am not aware <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that there is any Thing in it Above the Capacity of the most <hi>Ordinary Christian</hi> to comprehend; who


<pb facs="tcp:33743:3"/>
will but duly Consider what he Reads, and is not utterly a Stranger to the <hi>Principles</hi> of his <hi>Religion.</hi> 'Tis true, I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted many Things into this, which are not wont to be handled in Other <hi>Catechisms:</hi> As designing it not for <hi>Children,</hi> (for whom such Treatises are commonly framed;) but for <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women;</hi> for such as either have, or I am sure Ought to have, already pass'd the <hi>First Rudiments</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> But I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to express my self with so much Clearness, and Perspicuity, that I hope All sorts of Persons may be able to profit by what I have done; and see, in a short Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, both what that Holy <hi>Doctrine</hi> which we profess is, and upon what <hi>Grounds</hi> we build our <hi>Belief</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>I have chosen to do this in the <hi>Form</hi> of a <hi>Catechism,</hi> not only because I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that to be the Plainest, and most Natural Way of Instruction; but because it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Shortest, and most Easy to the Memory. And would but Parents take Care to teach their Children, at a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

Age, to <hi>Answer</hi> the <hi>Questions</hi> here proposed; they might possibly, thereby, not only take a Good Method for the <hi>Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Them in the Knowledge of that <hi>Religion</hi> into which they were <hi>Baptized;</hi> but might, at the same time, improve Themselves too, in the Understanding of it.</p>
            <p>It has been the Wisdom, as well as Piety, of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to make a Suitable Provision for the Instruction of all Sorts of Persons in her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in the Knowledge of their <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Profession.</hi> In Order hereunto, she has appointed <hi>Catechetical Exercises</hi> for Younger Persons, as well as <hi>Sermons</hi> for those of a Greater Age, and Understanding: And has Obliged <hi>Masters,</hi> and <hi>Parents,</hi> no less to send their <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> to the One, than to come Themselves to the Other. How Others may judge of this Her Pious Care, I cannot tell: But, for my Own Part, I must freely profess, that I never think my Self employ'd to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Purpose, than when I am discharging <hi>this Part</hi> of my <hi>Ministry.</hi> And I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,


<pb facs="tcp:33743:5"/>
that would all sorts of Persons but duly attend upon these <hi>Instructions;</hi> they would Reap a more substantial Benefit by them, than from those Other Exercises which have, I know not how, so universally Crept into the Place of them. It being certain, that the only Way either judiciously to hear, or truly to profit by, <hi>Sermons</hi>; is to lay a Good Foundation for both, by a previous <hi>Catechetical Institution</hi> in the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of <hi>Religion:</hi> And which, if Men have neglected when they were Young, the best way to Remedy that Defect, will be, not only to send their <hi>Children,</hi> but to come <hi>Themselves</hi> also, to our Publick <hi>Catechizings;</hi> where not only the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant may be Informed, but those who are the Best Improved, may possibly meet with Somewhat, either to <hi>Confirm</hi> their <hi>Faith,</hi> or to <hi>Direct</hi> their <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have divided the following <hi>Treatise</hi> into <hi>52 Sections;</hi> that so taking of one Every <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> the Whole may be Gone through <hi>Once</hi> in the <hi>Year.</hi> I have more or less Referr'd to <hi>Scripture-Proofs,</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:33743:6"/>
for every Point that I have proposed: And that not only to shew upon what Ground I build my <hi>Answers,</hi> but moreover to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom the <hi>Pious Reader</hi> to a better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with those <hi>Holy Writings.</hi> And I have purposely made the <hi>Sections</hi> very short, that so He may not only Peruse what I have written; but may be Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereby, at the same Time, diligently to compare it with, and examine it by, the Great <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Faith, The Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If by what I have done, I shall minister to the Improvement of any <hi>Good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> in the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> but especially to Those of my <hi>Own Cure;</hi> I shall think my Pains very happily bestow'd. If not, yet at least I shall have this Satisfaction, that I have done what in me lay to Supply their Necessities: And that it must be, in some Measure, their Own Faults, if they shall still continue Ignorant of what was needful to have been Known by them, in Order to their Salvation.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes there are; particularly the Hearing, Reading, and Meditating upon his Word: The Substance of which, tho' it be sufficiently ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd together, and represented to Us in our <hi>Catechism,</hi> yet ought not that to hinder our Reading of the Holy Scriptures, nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Us of any other Means of Christian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; but rather should be used as a Help whereby to render both the Reading, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of God's Word, more plain and profitable to Us. <hi>Psal.</hi> i.2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii.16. <hi>Jo.</hi> v.39. <hi>Rom.</hi> xv.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Does your Church-Catechism sufficiently instruct you in All These?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It does: For therein both the Nature of the Christian Covenant is declared to Us, and the Conditions are set forth on which we may become Partakers of it. And we are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Instructed, both how we ought to Pray to God; and what those Sacraments are, which are necessary to be Administred unto, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by All of Us.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> No; there is a <hi>Sorrow</hi> for Sin which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, not from any Love of God, or Sense of our Duty to Him;<note place="margin">2 Cor. vii.10.</note> nor yet from any real Hatred of the Sins which we have committed; but meerly from the fear of God's Judgment, and of the Punishment which we may be likely to suffer for them. This is that Sorrow which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Attrition</hi>; and may be in the most Wicked Men, without ever bringing them to any true Repentance for their Sins.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Only by the Grace of God, and the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Consideration of our Own Estate towards him: the former to be attain'd by our constant Prayers for it; the latter, by accustoming our selves often to Examine our Souls, and to try our Ways, by the measures of that Obedience which the Gospel of Christ requires of us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Do's not God make use of many other ways to bring Men to such a Sorrow?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God has many ways whereby to bring Sinners to Repentance. Sometimes he do's it by bringing some temporal Evils, and Calamities, upon them: Sometimes by visiting them with Terrors, and Disquiets of Mind: Sometimes he calls upon them by the Outward Ministry of his Word; and Sometimes by the Evils which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal Others, especially those who were their Companions in their Sins. But whatever the Occasions be which God is pleased to make use of to bring us to Repentance, it is the Grace of the Holy Spirit, and the serious Consideration of our own wretched Estate, that begins the Work, and produces in us that <hi>Godly Sorrow,</hi> which finally ends in a true <hi>Repentance.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Threats of God, denounced in the Holy Scriptures, against Impenitent Sinners;<note place="margin">Mat. xviii.3. Luke xiii.3. Prov. xxviii.19.</note> and the Promises there made of Pardon to all

               <p>A. <hi>Confession of Sin</hi>: Not that God has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny need of being informed by us of what we have done amiss; but to the end we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both raise in our selves a greater shame, and sorrow, for our Evil Doings; and give the greater Glory to God, by such a solemn hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of our selves in Confession before him.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What think you of that Confession (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called by them <hi>Auricular-Confession</hi>) which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> requires, as necessary to Forgiveness?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I look upon it as a great and dangerous Imposition, that has no warrant from God; is a great Rack and Snare to the Consciences of Good Men, and may be apt to encourage most Others in their Sins: Whilst by the <hi>Absolution,</hi> which is so readily given them thereupon (and the Efficacy of which is so highly magnified in that Church) they are taught to entertain a much less Opinion both of the Heinousness, and Danger, of their Evil-doings, than either the Scripture Warrants, or their own Interest should prompt them to admit of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is there not somewhat yet required, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this, in order to our Forgiveness?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes there is: for to all this there must be super-added an <hi>Actual forsaking</hi> of those Sins which we <hi>Confess,</hi> and that Absolute,<note place="margin">Prov. xxviii.13. Isa, Lv, 7, Ezek, xxxiii 11,</note> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reserve: so that we must firmly resolve, and, as much as in us lies, heartily endeavour, never to return again any more to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But ought there not, beyond all this some <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to be made to God, for the Sins which we have committed?</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What do you then say to those <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches we may, and ought to make, for our Sins?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That they are built upon a false Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; are contrary to the Goodness of God, and beyond the Capacity of Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the Foundation upon which they are built?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is this; That when God forgives us our Sins, whether upon our Own Repentance, or by virtue of the Priest's Absolution; He remits indeed the Fault, and purges away our Guilt; and by this acquits us from the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Punishment that would otherwise have been due to them; But yet still retains us under an Obligation to some temporal Sufferings, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Satisfactory Works to be done for them in this Life; or by undergoing a certain propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pain for them after Death, in a Place which they call <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How does it appear that this Foundation is false and erroneous?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because, in the first place, it is Absurd to suppose, that God should forgive the whole Guilt of our Sins, and yet, having done so, should afterwards punish us for them: And, secondly; It is injurious to the Sufferings and Merits of Christ, whose Death was a sufficient Satisfaction for the Sins of the whole World; and has left no room either for God to require, or for us to Pay, any thing more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Does Repentance then, if it be sincere, without any thing more, restore us again to our State of Grace, and reconcile us to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If it be sincere, it does, through Faith in Jesus Christ.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> I think them, in general, in much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter danger <hi>Now,</hi> than they were <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>: And still those in more danger who have lived among those of the <hi>Reformed Church,</hi> and so were in a better Capacity of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the Errors of their Way. But, most of all, do I think the Estate of those dangerous, or rather desperate, who are Learned, and know their Errors; or are Priests, and so called to instruct the People in the Purity of Christ's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The Sincere, and Ignorant, who want Capacity, or want Opportunity, to know the Truth, I hope God will forgive: The Careless, the Prejudiced; but, most of all, the obstinately blind, among them, I neither can acquit, nor do I think that God will forgive Them.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> In Matters of necessary Belief, they are very plain, even to the most Ordinary Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: Yet we do not deny but that every Man ought to <hi>hear</hi> the <hi>Church</hi>; and attend to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of those who are the Pastors of it.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To <hi>Believe,</hi> in the General, is to <hi>Assent to the Truth of any thing, upon the Sole Authority of the Person who delivers it:</hi> Who, if He be a <hi>Man</hi> only, the Assent which I give to what He says, produces in Me a <hi>Humane Faith</hi>; if, as here, He be <hi>God,</hi> then the Assent which I give to what is deliver'd by Him, is properly a <hi>Divine Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the difference, with respect to Us, between these Two?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is very Great: For because a Man, though never so Wise, and Careful himself, may yet not be honest, and so Impose upon Me: Or should he be never so Upright, may yet, after all his Care, be Mistaken himself, and thereby lead Me into Errour; therefore in As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to what such a One proposes, I can at the most give but such a <hi>Belief</hi> to it, as is suitable to a meer <hi>Humane Testimony.</hi> I may Believe what he says to be <hi>True,</hi> but yet so as not to exclude a <hi>Possibility</hi> of its being <hi>Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi> Whereas God being neither capable of being Deceived Himself, nor of Imposing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Other; when I give my Assent to what he has Revealed, I do it not only with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Assurance that what I believe <hi>is true,</hi> but with an absolute Security, that <hi>it cannot possibly be false.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But why do you say, <hi>I Believe,</hi> and not <hi>WE Believe</hi>; as when you pray, you say, <hi>OVR Father,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:33743:19"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because though One Man may <hi>Pray,</hi> yet One Man cannot <hi>Believe</hi> for another. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in Charity I may suppose every Christian to believe what is here delivered; yet since 'tis certain there are many <hi>Infidels,</hi> and <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> scatter'd up and down among the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and I cannot certainly distinguish who are indeed Believers, and who not; neither can I, with an Assurance of Faith, say, <hi>WE Believe,</hi> because I cannot certainly tell, whether ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man does truly believe these Articles or No. Besides, that this Creed being intended to be the Form, upon the Confession whereof, Persons should be admitted to Baptism; and in that Case, every One was to make a distinct Profession of his Faith, in order thereunto; it was fitting the Creed its self should be penn'd after such a manner, as was most proper for the main End for which it was Compos'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Are all the things contain'd in this Creed to be proved by <hi>Divine Revelation</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are all plainly deliver'd to us in the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi>; which being confessed by all Christians to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by them, must be look'd upon to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Us <hi>by God</hi> Himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the General Parts of which this Creed does consist?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are these Four: First, It shews us what is most needful to be Believ'd, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by Us, concerning <hi>God the Father:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Concerning our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> Thirdly, Concerning the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> And Fourthly, Concerning the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; its Duties and Privileges here, and the Blessings and Glory which God has prepared for it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I do think it necessary, whenever our Duty to God; or the Edification of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; or the Honour of our Religion, shall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it of Me. <hi>Mat.</hi> x.32. <hi>Whosoever shall Confess me before Men, him will I Confess also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Father which is in Heaven.

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did God Make All these?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After Two different Manners.

                  <hi>A.</hi> By his Son; sometimes call'd The Word: <hi>Job.</hi> i.3. <hi>All things were made by Him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Him was not any thing made that was made.</hi> And again, vii.10. <hi>The World was made by Him.</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> So the Scriptures expresly tell us: <hi>Heb.</hi> i.1, 2. <hi>God, who at sundry Times, and in divers Manners, spake in Time past unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the Prophets, Hath in these last Days spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto Vs by his Son; by whom also he made the Worlds.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of him,

Again: Of <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> we know not either who went before him, or who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Him in these <hi>Offices.</hi> So that his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> as to us, was a <hi>solitary Priesthood,</hi> in which as He succeeded None, so neither does it appear that any succeeded Him. And such also is the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi> There was never any such <hi>High-Priest</hi> before, nor shall there ever Rise up Any like him. <hi>Heb.</hi> vii.3, 6.—23, 24.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> In what Respect do you believe Christ to be the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He is called so in the Holy Scriptures upon several Accounts: * As he was <hi>Conceived</hi>


                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:33743:25"/>
by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary: Luk.</hi> i.45. * As He was <hi>anointed</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to the <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Messiah: Jo.</hi> x.34. * As he was <hi>Begotten</hi> again of <hi>God</hi> when he <hi>Raised Him</hi> from the <hi>Dead: Act.</hi> xiii.33. <hi>Rom.</hi> i.4. And, lastly, * as being Raised from the Dead, He was made by God the <hi>Heir of All things. Heb.</hi> i.3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> In which of these Respects do you here profess to believe, that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is the <hi>ONLY Son</hi> of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Precisely speaking, in none of them all; though yet I acknowledge the most of them to be so proper to Him, as not to be capable of being applied to any Other. But when I here profess Christ to be God's <hi>ONLY Son,</hi> I do it upon a much higher, and more excellent Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; namely, upon the Account of his <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation,</hi> and that <hi>Communication</hi> which <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> thereby made of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> to Him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If I believe the Scriptures to give a true Account of the Nature of Christ, so I must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: For I find the same Evidences in them of the <hi>Godhead</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> that I do of that of the <hi>Father.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>To him, Thirdly, they ascribe such <hi>Works,</hi> as can belong to None that is not <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>Creation</hi> of the <hi>World: Jo.</hi> i.3, 10. <hi>Col.</hi> i.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> i.2, 10.

               </p>
               <p>Add to this, Fourthly, that he is there shewn to be <hi>Honoured</hi> as God: <hi>Jo.</hi> v.23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Prayer</hi> fs made to him: <hi>Act.</hi> vii.59. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i.2. <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> are directed to be put in Him: <hi>Jo.</hi> xiv.1. <hi>Psal.</hi> ii.12. <hi>Praises</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> are Given to Him. <hi>Jo.</hi> xiv.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> iii.5. <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> are rendred to Him. <hi>Rev.</hi> v.13. compare iv.11.</p>
               <p>And no wonder; since, Lastly, the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is therein also expresly ascribed to Him: <hi>Heb.</hi> i.3. <hi>Phil.</hi> ii.6. <hi>Col.</hi> ii.9. compare <hi>Col.</hi> i.15, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But if Christ, therefore, be God, as well as the <hi>Father,</hi> how can He be called the <hi>Son of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because he Received his Divine Nature from the <hi>Father</hi>; who is the Beginning, and Root, of the Divinity; and has communicated his Own Essence to Christ: Who, therefore, though he has the <hi>same Nature,</hi> and so, in that, is <hi>Equal</hi> with the <hi>Father</hi>; yet is He in <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> after him; as being <hi>God of God.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How does it appear that <hi>Christ</hi> Received his <hi>Divine</hi> Nature from the <hi>Father</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It can only be known by that Revelation which God has made of it in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Where he is, for this Reason, said to be <hi>the Brightness of his Glory, and the express Image of his Person,</hi> Heb. i.3. <hi>The Image of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible God:</hi> Col. i.15. 2 Cor. iv.4. to be <hi>from God:</hi> Jo vii.29. to <hi>have Life from the Father:</hi> Jo. v.26. and the like. And upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is, that our Saviour himself says, <hi>that the Father is greater than he:</hi> Jo. xiv.28. <hi>That he can do Nothing of Himself, but what he seeth the Father do:</hi> Jo. v.18, 19. Or if this be not yet plain enough; they tell us farther, in express terms, that he is the <hi>Begotten,</hi> and the <hi>Only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, Son of the Father,</hi> Jo. i.14, 18. iii.16, 18. Heb xi.17. 1 Jo. iv.9. v.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But will not this make the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as much <hi>God's Son,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi>? And how then is <hi>Christ</hi> his <hi>Only Son</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In Matters of this kind, which are so far above our Capacities, and of which we know Nothing, but what God has been pleased to Reveal to Us, we must speak, as God, in his Word, has taught us to speak. Now the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures no where call the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the <hi>Son of God</hi>; nor <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>: And therefore though we know not what the precise Difference is, yet because the proper Act of a <hi>Father</hi> is to <hi>beget</hi>; we say that <hi>Christ</hi> Received his <hi>Divine Nature</hi> from <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>;<note place="margin">Jo. i.14. — iii.16.

of a great part of that Authority which he now exercises over his Church, is proper only to the present State of it, and will determine at the Day of Judgment; so will all the farther exercise of such Authority cease together with it.

                  <hi>A.</hi> For several Reasons. 1. To fix the time of his Suffering, which had been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly foretold by the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That there is but <hi>One God,</hi> the Holy Scriptures plainly declare; and even Reason it self confirms it to Us. And yet the Same Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as plainly declare, Every One of these

Three to be <hi>God.</hi> And the only way we know of Reconciling these Two, seemingly contrary, Assertions; is to say, that these Three partake of <hi>One,</hi> and the <hi>same Divine Nature,</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from the <hi>Father,</hi> to the <hi>Son</hi>; and from <hi>Both</hi> to the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> And that therefore They together make but <hi>One God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How can it be possible that Three distinct <hi>Persons,</hi> should so partake of the <hi>One, Divine Nature,</hi> or <hi>Essence,</hi> as All together to make but <hi>One God</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That is not my Concern to determine: This I am sure, that if the <hi>Scriptures</hi> be (as We all allow that they are) the <hi>Word of God,</hi> what they plainly deliver must be true, because it is, in effect, delivered by God himself; who can neither be Himself deceived, nor will deceive Me. Now that they deliver both these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions to me; That <hi>the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God:</hi> And yet, <hi>that there are not Three Gods, but One God:</hi> I am as sure, as I can be of any thing that is spoken, or written, for my Understanding. That therefore both these Assertions are True, and Credible, I am sure. But how, or after what manner, I am to understand them, so as to remove all shew of Contradiction in them, this the Holy Scriptures have not Revealed; nor do I therefore presume to pronounce any thing, more particularly, concerning it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why then do you say that they are <hi>Three Persons,</hi> and but <hi>One,</hi> in the <hi>Divine Essence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because I know not how better to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the <hi>Vnity,</hi> and <hi>Distinction</hi> of them; and they are <hi>Terms</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> has long Received; and I see no Reason to depart from them, unless I knew of some better,

                  <hi>A.</hi> There is certainly a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. <hi>THE Catholick Church,</hi> is, as I before said, The <hi>whole Church.</hi> But <hi>A Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi> implies no more than a <hi>Sound part</hi> of it; a <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> in opposition to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks:</hi> Who, whatsoever they may pretend, are really no parts of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>; nor shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd by <hi>Christ,</hi> as such.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whom do you account <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks</hi>? And how does it appear that they are not <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> is that <hi>Church</hi> which professes the <hi>true Faith</hi> which <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> deliver'd to it; and that, if not free


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:33743:39"/>
from All <hi>Errour</hi> whatsoever, yet without any such <hi>Errours,</hi> as destroy the <hi>Foundation</hi> of that <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which was committed to its Custody. Now a <hi>Heretick</hi> is One, who not only <hi>Errs</hi> in some Matters of lesser moment, but in Matters of such Consequence, as subvert the very <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi> But he who does this, can never be a Member of that <hi>Church,</hi> whose <hi>Doctrine</hi> he not only does not Receive, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: And who by his <hi>Errours</hi> destroys that very <hi>Faith,</hi> by which alone he can be intituled to the Character either of a true Disciple, or a sound Member of Christ's Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But why may not <hi>Schismaticks</hi> be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted true Members of <hi>Christs Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because none are <hi>Schismaticks</hi> but such as forsake, and cut themselves off from, the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Now it is a Contradiction that those should continue <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> who by their Own voluntary departure from it, have renounced the <hi>Communion</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Do you look upon the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to be a true part of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It certainly is: Inasmuch as it professes the <hi>true Catholick</hi> Faith, deliver'd in the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and drawn up in the <hi>Creeds</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; and, by the most ancient Councils, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be sufficient to denominate those who profess'd according thereunto, to be truly <hi>Catholick Christians:</hi> And also <hi>holds Communion</hi> with all such <hi>Churches</hi> as profess the same <hi>Faith</hi>; and, as far forth, as they do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is your Opinion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in this particular?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That she is both <hi>Schismatical,</hi> and <hi>Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Schismatical</hi>; in <hi>cutting off</hi> all Others from


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33743:39"/>
her <hi>Communion,</hi> who will not profess her <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> and submit to her <hi>Vsurp'd Authority: Heretical</hi>; in professing such <hi>Doctrines</hi> as quite destroy the <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi>; and are inconsistent with that <hi>Truth,</hi> which yet she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to maintain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> In what Respect do you believe the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church</hi> to be <hi>Holy</hi>?</p>

               <p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is this the peculiar Privilege of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> So the Scriptures tell us: There being <hi>no Other Name under Heaven given among Men,

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> From whom is this <hi>Forgiveness</hi> to be Sought?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Who hath Power to forgive Sins but</hi> God <hi>only?</hi> Mark ii.7. Of Him therefore it must be sought, in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But has not Christ left a <hi>Power</hi> with his <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>forgive Sins</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He has left with his <hi>Church</hi> a <hi>Ministerial Power,</hi> to declare forgiveness of Sins, to all such as truly Repent of them, and Believe in him. And when the Ministers of his Word, are called in to the Assistance of Sick, or Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Persons; they may, upon the Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a true Repentance, pronounce, in God's Name, the Pardon of their Sins to them. But in this they only deliver the Sentence of God; which, if the Sinner be truly Penitent, God will infallibly make Good: Otherwise, it will be of no Use to them; because it was <hi>erroneous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> though <hi>charitably,</hi> Pass'd upon Them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But does not the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> ascribe much more, to the <hi>Absolution</hi> of the <hi>Priest,</hi> than this?</p>
               <p>

And indeed God Himself seems to have had Regard unto it, when he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Moses</hi> to prepare <hi>Two Tables</hi> for Them: On the One of which, were to be Engraven Those which concern our <hi>Duty towards God</hi>; on the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Those which contain <hi>our Duty</hi> toward <hi>our Neighbour.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How many Commandments does each of these <hi>Tables</hi> comprehend?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As to the Commandments themselves, it is not doubted by Any, but that Those of the


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33743:47"/>
                  <hi>First Table</hi> end with that which Concerns the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>; and that the <hi>Second</hi> begins with that which Requires Us to <hi>Honour our Father, and our Mother.</hi> But in Dividing the <hi>Commandments</hi> of <hi>Each Table,</hi> there is a difference between <hi>Vs,</hi> and Those of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> For they join the <hi>Two First</hi> into <hi>One</hi>; and then, to complete the number of <hi>Ten,</hi> divide the <hi>Last</hi> into <hi>Two:</hi> And so assign, not as we do, <hi>Four</hi> to <hi>One Table,</hi> and <hi>Six</hi> to the <hi>Other</hi>; but <hi>Three</hi> to the <hi>First Table,</hi> and <hi>Seven</hi> to the <hi>Second.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it a Matter of Any Moment, How each Precept is divided, so long as All are Retained?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In its self it is not: But as the Design of this New Division was to enable them thereby to drop the <hi>Second Commandment,</hi> against their <hi>Image-Worship,</hi> altogether; (and which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from thenceforth they did oftentimes Omit, in their <hi>Common Books</hi> of <hi>Devotion</hi>;) so it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of Great Moment to be taken Notice of. Now the <hi>First,</hi> and <hi>Second Commandments,</hi> have apparently a <hi>Different Prospect,</hi> and were design'd to Prohibit <hi>Two</hi> very <hi>different Things.</hi> But the <hi>Last Commandment</hi> solely Respects the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting</hi>: And if the difference of the Instances which are Given in it, the better to clear, and inforce the Observance of it, be sufficient to make a Several Command, according to the Distinction of them; They may as well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it into <hi>Six,</hi> or indeed into <hi>Six hundred Commands,</hi> as into Two. For at this Rate, <hi>Thou shalt not Covet thy Neighbour's House,</hi> will be One: <hi>Thou shalt not Covet thy Neigbour's Wife,</hi> Another: <hi>Nor his Man-Servant,</hi> will be a Third: <hi>Nor his Maid-Servant,</hi> a Fourth: <hi>Nor his Ox,</hi> a Fifth: <hi>Nor his Ass,</hi> a Sixth: <hi>Nor any Thing that is his</hi>; a Hundred more, in One General Expression.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:33743:48"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But is there not One Great Branch of Our Duty here wanting, namely, Our <hi>Duty</hi> towards <hi>our Selves</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There is not: For all those Duties which we so call, have a manifest Regard, more or less, to our <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>our Neighbour</hi>; and may be comprised under the Offices rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Them. At least, since there is no Duty of this kind but what is Required by God of Us, the better to fit us for his Service, and Acceptance; it must be confess'd, that the <hi>First Commandment</hi> alone, will take in, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever of this Nature may seem wanting in the Whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is there any other <hi>Division</hi> of these <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> that may be fit to be taken Notice of, before we proceed to the particular Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There is yet One; namely, That of these Commandments, some are <hi>Positive,</hi> and declare what we are to <hi>Do</hi>; as the <hi>Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi> of the <hi>First Table</hi>; the <hi>Fifth</hi> in the <hi>Second.</hi> Others are <hi>Negative,</hi> and shew Us what we are to <hi>Avoid</hi>; As <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Others</hi> of <hi>Both Tables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What do you Observe from this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A Great Difference with Respect to our Obligation to Obedience. For (1<hi>st</hi>) The <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Commands,</hi> though they are always in force, and therefore Oblige all who have any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern with them, and so long as they are under the Power of them; yet they do not extend to <hi>All Persons,</hi> nor <hi>Oblige</hi> at <hi>All Times.</hi> As for Example: <hi>To Honour our Father and Mother,</hi> is a Duty of Eternal Obligation. But then many there are, Who have no <hi>Father,</hi> nor <hi>Mother</hi>;


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33743:48"/>
and therefore neither can They lie under any Obligation to <hi>Honour</hi> Them. Again; To <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Sabbath Day to keep it Holy,</hi> is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that never Ceases to Oblige. But yet should a Man be made a <hi>Prisoner,</hi> or a <hi>Slave,</hi> in a <hi>Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Other Country,</hi> where he had no Means, nor Opportunity to Observe it; whilst he lay under those Circumstances, he would not be Guilty of any Sin by <hi>not Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> of it. But now the <hi>Negative Commands,</hi> not only <hi>Oblige always,</hi> but <hi>all Persons</hi>; at <hi>all Times</hi>; and <hi>in all Circumstances.</hi> And therefore, to <hi>Worship any other God, besides the Lord: To make any Graven Image, to bow down before it, and worship it: To take God's Name in Vain:</hi> These, and the like <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> oblige Men to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, uninterrupted Observance of them; be their Circumstances, or Conditions of Life, what they will. Nor can it, at any Time, or upon any Occasion, be lawful for any Man, <hi>To worship another God; To make a Graven Image to worship it; To take God's Name in Vain</hi>; and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Have you any thing farther to Observe from this <hi>Division</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This only; that <hi>these Two kinds mutually Include one Another:</hi> So that when God <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> any Duty to be perform'd, we are to understand that he does, by the very same Command, <hi>forbid</hi> whatsoever is contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, to be done by Us. And again, when he <hi>forbids</hi> any thing to be done; he does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Require</hi> Us to <hi>fulfil</hi> the Opposite Duty, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd; as well as to <hi>avoid</hi> the Sin which is expresly taken Notice of. To clear my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an Instance of Each Kind. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us, in the <hi>Fourth Commandment,</hi> to <hi>keep


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33743:49"/>
holy the Sabbath-Day</hi>; and that by <hi>Sanctifying</hi> of it to a <hi>Religious Rest:</hi> And, by the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, he <hi>forbids</hi> Us to <hi>do</hi> any <hi>servile Work</hi> upon it; or any thing whereby this Day, may be <hi>unhallow'd,</hi> or <hi>profaned</hi> by Us. And this would have been understood, by the Other part of the Command, though God had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly taken notice of it. In like manner; When in the <hi>Sixth Commandment,</hi> God forbids us to <hi>Commit Murder</hi>; we are to understand, that we are not only <hi>prohibited</hi> thereby to stab, or poison, our Neighbour; but are <hi>Required</hi> to do, what in Us lies, to <hi>Cherish,</hi> and <hi>Preserve</hi> his <hi>Life:</hi> To help him, if he be assaulted by Another; to feed, and cloath him, as far as we are able; and to prevent, according to Our Ability, whatsoever may bring him in danger of losing of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Are there any Other <hi>General Rules</hi> that may be of Use to us, in the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> of the <hi>Commandments</hi> here proposed to Us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There are Several such <hi>Rules</hi>; but those of most consequence seem to be these <hi>Four.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That in every Commandment, the General thing Express'd, comprehends under it all such Particulars, as either directly depend upon it; or may Fairly, and Reasonably, be Reduced to it.</q>
Thus the <hi>Seventh Commandment,</hi> though in express Terms, it Forbids only the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Adultery</hi>; yet, under that General, is to be extended to all manner of <hi>Fornication, Vncleanness, Lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viousness</hi>; not only to all <hi>unchast Actions,</hi> but to all <hi>wanton Words, Thoughts, Desires:</hi> To all <hi>immodest Behaviour,</hi> and <hi>indecent Attire.</hi> To whatsoever, in short, may intrench upon that Gravity, and Reservedness, which our Religion Requires of Us; or may be apt to tempt Us to


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33743:49"/>
such Sins as are here forbidden: Such as <hi>high</hi> and <hi>full Diet; soft Cloathing</hi>; the <hi>Company</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Younger,</hi> especially of <hi>wanton Women</hi>; from all which we must abstain by vertue of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: As also, from all Places of <hi>Danger</hi>; such as <hi>Play-houses, Balls, Dancings, Musick-meetings,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the next <hi>General Rule</hi> to be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, in the <hi>Interpreting</hi> of these <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>That</hi> where any Duty is Required, or Sin is Forbidden; we are to Reckon our selves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged thereby, to Vse all such Means as may En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Vs to Fulfil the One, and to Avoid the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q>
Thus, because in the <hi>Eighth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> we are Required not <hi>to Steal</hi>; therefore, in order to our more constant, and ready A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of it, we must account our selves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, not only to watch our Actions, that we do not in any Thing defraud our Neighbour; but moreover must do, what in us lies, to keep our selves out of such Circumstances as may be likely to tempt us thereunto. We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by vertue of this Commandment, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to <hi>Work</hi> for the supply of our Own <hi>Needs,</hi> and of the <hi>Wants</hi> of those who <hi>depend</hi> upon Us. We are to <hi>live Soberly,</hi> and <hi>Frugally; free from Vice,</hi> and all <hi>Extravagance.</hi> We are to avoid all <hi>Lewdness, Gaming,</hi> and the like <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> of <hi>Excess:</hi> To abstain from all <hi>Idle, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,</hi> and <hi>Dishonest Conversation,</hi> and <hi>Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>; and from whatsoever else may be apt to tempt us to, or engage Us in the Sin, which is here forbidden to Us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the <hi>Third Rule</hi> to be Observed, for the better Understanding of these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:33743:50"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi>
                  <q>That the last Commandment is to be look'd upon by Vs, not so much as a Single Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a General Caution Given to Vs, with Relation to most of the Duties of the Second Table; which ought to be Govern'd, and Influenced by it.</q>
Thus because we must not <hi>steal from,</hi> or <hi>defraud</hi> our <hi>Neighbour</hi> of his <hi>Goods,</hi> neither must we <hi>Covet</hi> them. Because we must not <hi>commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> neither must we <hi>Lust.</hi> Because we must <hi>do no Murder,</hi> neither must we <hi>desire</hi> the <hi>hurt,</hi> or <hi>death</hi> of our <hi>Neighbour.</hi> For this is the first spring of Evil in our Hearts; and by stopping of which, we shall the most effectually Arm our selves against the Commission of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the last <hi>General Rule</hi> to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, for the better <hi>Interpretation</hi> of <hi>God's Commandments?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi>
                  <q>That wheresoever we are Prohibited to Do any thing our Selves, as Sinful, there we are to take Care that we be not Partakers of Other Mens Guilt, who do Commit what was so prohibited: <hi>By</hi> Advising, Assisting, Encouraging, <hi>or Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi> Aiding, <hi>and</hi> Abetting <hi>them, in it.</hi>
                  </q>
Nay, we must not so much as <hi>Give</hi> any <hi>Countenance</hi> to the Evil which they do, by making <hi>Excuses</hi> for, and <hi>extenuating</hi> their <hi>Guilt</hi>; by <hi>hiding,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing</hi> of it; least by so doing, we make our selves accessary to it, and contract to our selves a stain by it.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the chief <hi>Offences</hi> that may be Committed, against this Part of the <hi>first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:33743:51"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are chiefly these: First, <hi>Atheism,</hi> and <hi>Infidelity,</hi> whether it be <hi>Speculative,</hi> or <hi>Practical</hi>; that is to say, whether Men do Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally believe that there is no God; or live so as if they did; without either any due <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Him,</hi> or <hi>Regard</hi> to <hi>Him.</hi> Next to these; all <hi>Vnworthy Opinions</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Blasphemous Thoughts,</hi> or <hi>Speeches,</hi> against Him. Such are the Thoughts, and Speeches, of Those who not only deny the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> but make it their Business to Expose, and Ridicule the Belief of it. And, lastly; Such are all the <hi>Heinous,</hi> but especially the <hi>Habitual Sins,</hi> which Men fall into; and the consequence of which plainly shews, either that they do not, in Good Earnest, believe the LORD to be their God, or that they are yet to consider what that Belief requires of Them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the Other thing proposed to Us in this Commandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Not to have any Other, besides the</hi> LORD, for <hi>our God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is there any Other God, besides the LORD?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, there is not; nor does this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment at all Suppose that there is. But when these Commandments were delivered, the World generally believed in, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, <hi>Other Gods,</hi> besides the LORD; who was almost utterly forgotten by Them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was highly necessary, that the LORD should, in the very first Place, caution his People against this Folly, and Idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How many ways may a Man have <hi>Others</hi> for their <hi>Gods,</hi> besides the LORD?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By as many ways as we are capable of shewing, that We <hi>have Him</hi> for our <hi>God:</hi>


                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:33743:52"/>
Namely, First, by <hi>Thinking</hi> of them as <hi>God</hi>; and, Secondly, by <hi>Worshipping</hi> of them as Such.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it possible for any Man who <hi>knows,</hi> and <hi>worships</hi> the LORD, to have any <hi>Other God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides him?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. viii.5, 6. Gal. iv.8. 1 Kin. xi.4. 2 Kin. xvii<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 33, 34.</note>
                  <hi>A.</hi> So this Commandment evidently Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and so indeed it may easily enough be: There being nothing so Unreasonable which an immoderate Superstition is not capable of leading, sometimes, even Wise-men into. And therefore not only God here gives this Caution to the <hi>Jews</hi>; but St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in like manner, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warns even the <hi>Christians</hi> to whom he preached, <hi>to flee from Idolatry</hi>; 1 Cor. x.14. and not to <hi>keep Company with a Brother,</hi> that is a Christian, <hi>who was Guilty of it.</hi> 1 Cor. v.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How can this be; seeing He who <hi>knows,</hi> and <hi>believes aright</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; must <hi>know,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> that there neither is, nor can be, any <hi>God</hi> besides Him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Would Men always Act consistently to their Own Knowledge, and Profession, it would then indeed be Impossible for those who had a Right Notion of God, to have any Other God besides Him. But, as in Other Cases, Men may know very well what their Duty is, and yet Act contrary to it; so it is certain that they not only may, but have done, in the Case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Us. In short, Whosoever gives <hi>Divine Honour</hi> to any <hi>Being,</hi> does thereby <hi>profess</hi> that <hi>Being</hi> to be God, as much as He who swears Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to any Person, does by such his Action, Recognize that Person for his Prince. Now such an Honour <hi>Religious Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Invocation,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all controversy are. Yet these the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> does publickly, and solemnly, Pay to Others, besides the LORD; and, by so doing,


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:33743:52"/>
shews to all the World, that <hi>She has Other Gods, besides Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What do you then suppose to be the full import, of this Second Part, of the present Commandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we should neither Believe in, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, or Worship any Other, as God, besides the LORD: Whether it be by <hi>Forsaking Him,</hi> and <hi>Falling off altogether to Idolatry</hi>; or by <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Any Other Being, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> with Him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A. Thou shalt not make to thy self any Graven Image,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How does this <hi>Commandment</hi> differ from the Foregoing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Design of the <hi>First Commandment</hi> was to determine, and set us Right in, the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of our <hi>Religious Worship</hi>; and to prevent Us from giving <hi>Divine Honour</hi> to any besides the <hi>true God.</hi> The Design of <hi>this,</hi> is to direct Us in the <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>worshipping Him</hi>; that so we may not only serve the <hi>true God,</hi> but may serve him <hi>after such a Manner</hi> as he Requires, and is most sitting for Us to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the full Import of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is this; First, * That we must not make any <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God, at all</hi>; be our Design what it will, in making of it. Nor, Secondly, * <hi>That</hi> of <hi>any Other Being,</hi> with an Intention to pay any <hi>Honour,</hi> or <hi>Worship,</hi> to it.</p>

                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:33743:53"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Do you think it utterly Unlawful to make any Image at all of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is certainly Unlawful, and is in many Places of <hi>Scripture</hi> expresly forbidden;<note place="margin">Lev. xix.4. xxvi.i. Acts xvii.29. Ezek. xiv.5.</note> as being highly dishonourable to the <hi>Infinite Nature,</hi> and <hi>Majesty of God</hi>; and of Great danger, and harm to Us.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What think you of the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; may that be made without offending against this Commandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Christ</hi> being Man, as well as God, his <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> may certainly be aptly enough Represented by an <hi>Image</hi>; nor would it be any Sin so to do, provided that No Use were made of any such <hi>Image,</hi> in any part of our <hi>Religious Worship.</hi> But to Represent <hi>God the Father</hi> in a Graven Image; to paint the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> and that in so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane a manner as it has often been done in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> is certainly a Great Sin, and a Great Scandal; and directly contrary to the Intention of this Commandment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Do you then look upon all <hi>Vse</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> in <hi>God's Service</hi> to be <hi>Vnlawful</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I do account it contrary to the <hi>Prohibition</hi> of this <hi>Commandment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lev. xxvi.1. Deut. iv.16. Amos v.26.</note> and by consequence, <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Aaron</hi> first, and afterwards <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> made Use of them for this purpose; we find how highly God was pleased to Resent it; and with what detestation it is condemn'd in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That it is Scandalous, and Intolerable: There having never been greater <hi>Idolatry</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted among the Heathen in the business of


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:33743:53"/>
                  <hi>Image-Worship,</hi> than has been committed in that <hi>Church</hi>; and is, by Publick Authority, still pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by it; especially in the Ceremony of their <hi>Good-Friday, Cross-Worship.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Do you think they are so foolish as to <hi>Worship</hi> the <hi>Cross</hi>; or is it <hi>Idolatry</hi> to <hi>worship Christ,</hi> in <hi>presence of the Cross</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If we may either believe their Own Words, or judge by their Actions, they <hi>Adore the Cross,</hi> as well as <hi>Christ</hi>; and Both alike, and with the same Worship. As for the new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>worshipping Christ in Presence of the Cross,</hi> it is a meer delusion, contrived only to cheat ignorant People: And carries just as much sense in it, as if you should ask, whether it were lawful to say your Prayers <hi>in Presence of a Post</hi>; or to write a Letter in <hi>the Presence of a Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi>; the Nonsense of which there is no One so dull as not to discover.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the <hi>Positive Duty</hi> Required of Us in this <hi>Commandment</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To <hi>worship God</hi> after a manner suitable to his Divine Nature, and Excellencies: <hi>God is a Spirit, and whoso will Worship Him aright, must do it in Spirit and in Truth, Jo.</hi> iv.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> xii.1. Comp. <hi>Mat.</hi> xv.8, 9.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He has done it after a very singular Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: By declaring, 1st; That He is a <hi>jealous God, Acts</hi> xvii.29. and <hi>will not suffer His Glory to be given to Another;</hi>

ought to do, He will shew abundant Mercy in this present Time; and, in the World to come, Give them Life Everlasting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Can it consist with the Justice of God <hi>to Punish One</hi> for the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Another</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No certainly, nor does God here threaten any such thing. But God, who is the great LORD of the whole World, may so punish a Man for his Sins, that the Evil of it shall Reach not to Himself alone, but to his Posterity also. And thus the Children may be <hi>Visited,</hi> and yet not <hi>Punish'd,</hi> for their Father's <hi>Idolatry.</hi> As in the Case of High-Treason, the Father by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting his Honour, and Estate, brings the Ill-consequence of his Crime upon his Family as well as upon himself; and the Prince, by exacting the Penalty of the Law, does truly <hi>Visit</hi>; tho not <hi>Punish,</hi> his <hi>Posterity</hi>; for the Offence which He alone Committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How then do you Understand this Part of the Commandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God had, in general, promised to the <hi>Jews Temporal Blessings</hi> to Encourage their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and had denounced <hi>present Evils</hi> against them, to keep them from Sinning. But to set a particular Mark of his Indignation upon the Sin of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> He thought fit to declare, that if they Offended in this Matter, He would not only severely punish them Himself,<note place="margin">1 Kings xiv.22, xv.13. 2 Kings xxii.17. xxiv.3. Lam. v.6.</note> but would deliver them up into the Hands of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who should both Oppress Them, and their Children after Them. Whereas if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued firm to his Worship, tho' otherwise they should be guilty of many lesser Crimes, yet he would not cast them off from his Favour;<note place="margin">1 King. xi.34. 2 Kings viii.19.</note> but, on the contrary, would bless both Them, and their Posterity, with Plenty, and Prosperity, all


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33743:54"/>
their Days. This I take to have been the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meaning of the present Denunciation; and how exactly it was made Good to Them, their History sufficiently declares to Us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> May this be, in any wise, Apply'd to Us Now?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thus far it may, To teach us how hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is; how Odious in the sight of God; how worthy of his Vengeance; how certain to feel it. The <hi>Jews</hi> were, in their whole Estate, a <hi>Figure</hi> to Us:<note place="margin">1 Cor. vi.9. Gal. v.20. Rev. xxi.8. — xxii.15.</note> As therefore God threatned that he would, with the utmost Severity, Require this Sin of Them; so most certainly he will do it of Us; It may be in this present Life, but without all Controversie in the Life which is to Come.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I think it to be, without all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, <hi>Sinful</hi>: As Giving that <hi>Honour</hi> to the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> which is due only to the <hi>Creator.</hi> And so God himself declares that he accounts it: <hi>Deut.</hi> vi.13. <hi>Thou shalt fear the</hi> LORD <hi>thy God, and

serve him: and shalt swear by his Name; Ye shall not Go after Other Gods.</hi> And again, <hi>Deut.</hi> x.20. <hi>Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God; Him shalt thou serve, and to Him shalt thou cleave, and Swear by his Name.</hi> And when, in process of time, that People began to do otherwise; the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> tells us how heinously God Resented the Affront that was thereby put upon Him: <hi>Jer.</hi> v.7. <hi>How shall I pardon Thee for this? Thy Children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no Gods.</hi> And again, <hi>Amos</hi> viii.14. <hi>They that Swear by the Sin of Samaria, and say, Thy God, O Dan, liveth, and the manner of Beersheba liveth: Even they shall Fall, and never Rise up again.</hi> Comp. <hi>Josh.</hi> xxiii.7. <hi>Jer.</hi> xii.16. <hi>Zeph.</hi> i.5.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The very Nature of an <hi>Oath</hi> declares it: Which supposes the Person whom we <hi>Swear</hi> by, to be capable both of <hi>discerning</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> or <hi>Falshood,</hi> of what is <hi>Sworn</hi>; and the <hi>Sincerity</hi> or <hi>Insincerity,</hi> with which we <hi>Swear</hi>; and also of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing</hi> us for our <hi>Perjury,</hi> if we <hi>Swear Otherwise</hi> than we <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>do.</hi> All which are Actions proper to God alone: And above the Capacity of any Creature; and therefore being ascribed to One who is not God, must needs give the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to God alone, to that Person by whom we Swear.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it lawful to <hi>Swear</hi> in any Matter of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if we take care to Swear in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as we ought to do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It has been the Opinion of many Good Men, that We should decline all <hi>Voluntary Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> even in Matters of Moment, as much as may be: And that for fear of <hi>Perjury,</hi> which is a Sin of


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33743:56"/>
a very heinous Nature, Yet if we are required to do it by such whom we ought not to disobey, and we do it Faithfully, and Reverently; it is both an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Religious Worship</hi>;<note place="margin">Psal. lxiii.11.</note> and for the <hi>Glory of God</hi>; and upon both those Accounts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly <hi>Lawful.</hi> Nor did our <hi>Saviour</hi> ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to forbid <hi>Swearing</hi> altogether; but only to Restrain all <hi>Voluntary,</hi> and <hi>Needless, Vse</hi> of it in <hi>Common Conversation</hi>; and to keep Us, when we do Swear, to the Doing of it only by the Name of God, and not by that of any <hi>Other Thing,</hi> or <hi>Person.</hi> See <hi>Mat.</hi> v.34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> So <hi>Moses</hi> tells Us, <hi>Gen.</hi> ii.2. And it is not to be doubted but that accordingly such a <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> did continue to be Observed, so long as any Sense of true Religion Remained upon the Earth.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> As it was needful for him to Renew many Other Precepts, which yet were certainly both given by him, and Observed in the World, long before. No body doubts but that <hi>Adam,</hi> and his first Descendents, both <hi>knew,</hi> and <hi>worshipped</hi> the <hi>True God</hi>; Yet this was provided for again Now.

Us; as Men lived farther off from the <hi>Creation,</hi> and Wickedness prevailed over the Face of the Earth, and the <hi>true Worship</hi> of God was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by almost a Universal <hi>Idolatry</hi>; so was the Solemn <hi>Day</hi> of his <hi>Worship</hi> neglected like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. And tho' it may have in some measure been received after the <hi>Floud,</hi> and continued, in some part of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family; yet, in their <hi>Aegyptian Slavery,</hi> it was utterly abolish'd; and the very memory of it seems to have been lost among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When did God Renew this Command to Them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Presently after their passing thro' the <hi>Red Sea, Exod.</hi> xvi. when he began to give the <hi>Manna</hi> to Them. For then he commanded them to gather it every Morning <hi>Six Days</hi>; but on the <hi>Sixth Day</hi> to provide a double Quantity for the next Day; because that thereon they should keep the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to the LORD, and no <hi>Manna</hi> should <hi>fall,</hi> or be <hi>Gathered,</hi> upon it.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> On that which They, from thenceforth, Observed for their <hi>Sabbath-Day,</hi> and which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to our <hi>Saturday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was that the same Day on which God <hi>Rested</hi> from the <hi>Creation,</hi> and which He had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Commanded <hi>Adam</hi> to keep in memory of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we cannot tell: By the Providence of God so it may have been; but that it was so, God has not declared to Us, nor is it possible, (without a particular Revelation,) for Us to come to the knowledge of it. That which is more certain is, that God designed this <hi>Particular Day</hi> to be kept by the <hi>Jews</hi> in memory of his <hi>deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of them out of their <hi>Egyptian Slavery,</hi> and of


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33743:58"/>
his Miraculous <hi>feeding</hi> Them with <hi>Manna</hi> in the Wilderness. And for this Reason it was that He Required that strict Rest of them, of which we Read: <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxi, 12, <hi>&amp;c. Nehem.</hi> xiii.15. <hi>Isai.</hi> lviii.13. that thereby they might both keep up the memory of the hard Work they had been held to during their Abode in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they were not suffer'd to <hi>Rest</hi> on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day</hi>; and be the more engaged to serve that God, who had so wonderfully delivered them from that Wretched Estate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How then, upon the whole, are we to consider the <hi>Jewish Sabbath,</hi> here establish'd by God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is evident from the several Reasons Given for it, in the Command its self, that it must be consider'd in two different Respects: 1st, As a Day to be Kept by Them in memory of the <hi>Creation: Exod.</hi> xx.11. and to declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thereby to be the Worshippers of that God, Who <hi>Created the Heaven and Earth</hi>: And to this End, they were Required to Observe a <hi>Seventh day of Rest,</hi> after <hi>Six of Labour</hi>; because God wrought <hi>Six days,</hi> and Rested the <hi>Seventh.</hi> And, 2dly, as a day to be Observed in Memory of their <hi>Egyptian-Bondage,</hi> and of God's deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out of it: <hi>Deut.</hi> v.15. And thus the <hi>Jews</hi> were tied to Observe not only the <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but the very <hi>day</hi> of the Week too; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that day on which they had pass'd the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and so were set intirely free from their Slavery. For which Reason also they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not only to worship <hi>God</hi> upon it, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to <hi>abstain</hi> from all <hi>bodily Labour</hi>; and that under the Pain of Death, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxi.12, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How far do you suppose this Command Obliges Us now?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As much as ever it did the <hi>Jews,</hi> tho' not exactly after the <hi>same Manner.</hi> We worship, as they did, that God who <hi>in Six days Created the Heaven, and Earth; the Sea, and All that in them is, and Rested the Seventh day:</hi> and in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment thereof We stand Obliged, with Them, to keep a <hi>Seventh day</hi> of <hi>Rest,</hi> after <hi>Six</hi> of <hi>Labour.</hi> But then as they worshipp'd this God under the peculiar Character, of <hi>the God who brought them out of the Land of Egypt, out of the House of Bondage,</hi> so were they determined to take that particular <hi>day,</hi> the <hi>Seventh</hi> of the <hi>Week,</hi> for their <hi>Sabbath,</hi> on which he compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Deliverance; and strictly to <hi>abstain</hi> from <hi>all bodily Labour</hi> upon it. Now in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect We differ from them. We worship God, the Creator of the World, under a much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and more divine Character; as he is our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and <hi>Deliverer,</hi> by <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> our <hi>Lord:</hi> Who upon the <hi>first day</hi> of the <hi>Week, Rose from the Dead,</hi> and thereby put an End to the <hi>Jewish Oeconomy.</hi> And in testimony hereof, we keep the <hi>First day</hi> of the <hi>Week</hi> for our <hi>Sabbath</hi>; and so profess our selves to be the Servants of the <hi>True God,</hi> thro' the <hi>Covenant</hi> which he has been pleased to make with Us, in <hi>Christ Jesus our Lord.</hi>

But as for all <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Gain</hi>; all such Allowances as are inconsistent with the Religious Design of the Day, or may be apt to give Offence to any Good Men; they ought, without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, to be avoided upon it.</p>

to Regulate our <hi>Outward Actions</hi> towards Each Other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is a Man Obliged, in all Cases, to <hi>Do all</hi> that for his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> which he would desire his <hi>Neighbour</hi> should <hi>Do</hi> for <hi>Him</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, certainly; provided the <hi>Rule</hi> be but Rightly Stated, and duly Limited, by Us: Otherwise it may prove a Snare, rather than a Guide, to Us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How then do you Suppose that this <hi>Rule</hi> is to be <hi>Vnderstood</hi> by Us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We must first set <hi>our Selves</hi> in our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Place,</hi> and then put it to Our Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Were <hi>his</hi> Case <hi>our Own,</hi> what would we desire that One, in Our Circumstances, should <hi>Do for Vs,</hi> and then conclude, that We ought to <hi>Do the Same for Him.</hi> Thus for Example; If a <hi>poor Man ask</hi> an <hi>Alms</hi> of Us; We must not think that We are at Liberty to Refuse him, because we neither <hi>need,</hi> nor <hi>desire,</hi> that Any One should <hi>Relieve</hi> Us: But we must bring his Case home to our selves; and suppose that we were in <hi>his Circumstances; poor,</hi> and <hi>destitute</hi>; would we not then think it Reasonable, that One, in <hi>Our Circumstances,</hi> should <hi>Relieve Vs</hi>; and that will shew Us, that therefore we ought to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But must We then, after such a <hi>Change</hi> of <hi>Circumstances,</hi> absolutely <hi>Do to Others,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we would, in the like Circumstances, desire, that They should do to Us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I do not say that neither: Men may <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> what is <hi>Vnlawful,</hi> and then in <hi>Conscience</hi> of our <hi>Duty to God,</hi> we must <hi>deny them.</hi> They may desire what is <hi>Vnreasonable,</hi> or may be <hi>Greatly Inconvenient</hi> to Us; and, in such Cases, though we Owe a <hi>Duty</hi> to our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> yet


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:33743:61"/>
we must Remember that we Owe a <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>our Selves</hi> too; and must consider our <hi>Own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,</hi> as well as those of <hi>Our Neighbour.</hi> If a Man should fall into such Circumstances, as to need my <hi>telling</hi> of <hi>a Lie</hi>; or <hi>Forswearing my self,</hi> to bring him safely out of Them; though I should be so Wicked as to <hi>desire,</hi> in the like Case, that <hi>Another</hi> would do <hi>the same</hi> for <hi>Me,</hi> yet I am not therefore Obliged, by this <hi>Rule,</hi> to do this for Him; because neither <hi>ought I to desire</hi> such a <hi>Thing</hi> of <hi>Another,</hi> nor <hi>ought Any Other to desire</hi> it of <hi>Me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again; Should a Man desire me to be <hi>bound</hi> with him for a <hi>considerable Sum of Money</hi>; which I cannot <hi>pay,</hi> without great <hi>Damage</hi> to <hi>my self,</hi> and <hi>Prejudice</hi> to my <hi>Family:</hi> Though I should perhaps <hi>wish,</hi> that, had I the same Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that this Man has, <hi>Another</hi> would be <hi>bound</hi> for Me; yet because the <hi>desire</hi> is <hi>Vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,</hi> and such as in <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>my self,</hi> and my <hi>Family,</hi> I ought not to comply with; neither am I obliged, by vertue of this Rule, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer his Desires in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What then do you take to be the <hi>true Import</hi> of this <hi>Rule</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That whatsoever I could <hi>justly,</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably, Desire</hi> of <hi>Another</hi> Man, in my <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>; and it would become him, in <hi>Charity,</hi> to <hi>do for Me</hi>; the same ought I to <hi>do</hi> for my <hi>Neighbour:</hi> And thereby make it manifest, as the Other Rule directs, that I do, indeed, <hi>Love him as my Self.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Does not this Commandment Require some Return of <hi>Duty</hi> from <hi>those,</hi> who are, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any of these Accounts, to be <hi>Honoured</hi> by Us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In the Equity of it, it certainly does: And therefore as it is <hi>Our Duty</hi> to <hi>Honour Them,</hi> so it is no less <hi>their Duty</hi> to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as their Relation requires, towards Us.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> That may not Generally be affirm'd: There are great Inequalities in the Affections of the best Men in their Prayers; Nor can Any avoid all kind of <hi>Wandrings,</hi> and <hi>Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances,</hi> in them.

                  <hi>utmost Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Attention,</hi> that He is able to do.

Secondly, That we should Pray for <hi>Others,</hi> as well as for our <hi>Selves</hi>; and that in our <hi>Private,</hi> as well as our <hi>Publick Prayers.</hi> Thirdly, That we may pray for the <hi>Necessaries</hi> of <hi>this Life</hi>; though our main Concern should be, in our Prayers, as well as our Endeavours, after <hi>Those</hi> of the <hi>Other.</hi> Fourthly, That we should <hi>Pray</hi> to <hi>God

                  <hi>A.</hi> It was fit to be mention'd upon several Accounts: 1st.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:33743:78"/>
Merciful <hi>Father forgive Vs,</hi> in what we have Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him. It was fit to have been added, 2dly; as a Motive, upon the same Grounds,<note place="margin">Mat. vii.11.</note> to assure Us, that if we truly Repent of our Sins, and beg of God the Forgiveness of Them, God will certainly Remit them to Us. It was fit to have been added, 3dly; to put us continually in mind of the necessity we lie under to forgive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and to engage Us readily, and heartily so to do: Considering that till we have done it,<note place="margin">Mat. vi.15. Mark xi.25.26.</note> we cannot pray to God for his Forgiveness; and that if we do not Do it sincerely, God will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find it out: And tho' by pretending a Reconciliation where Really it is not, we may delude Men, yet we cannot possibly deceive God.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Because the whole <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as before described, does belong to them. For, 1st.

                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to these adds five more; tho' They cannot say that they are all of Christ's Institution; <hi>viz. Confirmation: Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: Extreme-Vnction: Orders</hi>: and <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi>

               <p>In <hi>EXTREME VNCTION</hi> there is an <hi>Outward Sign,</hi> but neither of <hi>Christ</hi>'s, nor his <hi>Apostles,</hi> Institution.<note place="margin">Mark vi.13. 1 Jam. v.14, 15.</note> They <hi>anointed Sick Persons</hi> for the Recovery of their Bodily Health; and, in certain Cases, advised the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>the Church</hi> to be sent for, to do likewise. But as to any <hi>Spiritual Effects,</hi> they neither used any such <hi>Sign</hi> themselves, nor Recommended it to Others: Nor is there any the least Ground on which to expect any such benefit from the Use of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MATRIMONY,</hi> is a <hi>Holy</hi> State, <hi>ordain'd</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> and highly to be accounted of by All Men.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ORDINATION,</hi> is also a <hi>Divine Institution.</hi> By the Administration of it Authority is Given to those Who partake of it, to minister in Holy Things; which, otherwise, it would not have been lawful for them to do.

To talk of an Expiatory Sacrifice for Sin, without Suffering, is not only contrary to Scripture, but is in the Nature of the thing its self Absurd, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable: Every Sacrifice being put in the Place of the Person for whom it is offer'd; and to be treated so, as that Person, in Rigour, ought to have been, had not God admitted of a Sacrifice in his stead. And therefore the Apostle, from hence, concludes,<note place="margin">Heb. ix 25.26.</note> that Christ could not be more than <hi>Once Offer'd,</hi> because he could but <hi>Once Suffer.</hi> But to suppose that Christ, in his present <hi>Glorified State,</hi> can <hi>Suffer,</hi> is such a Contradiction to all the Principles of our Religion, that the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves are ashamed to assert it.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, He did: He first <hi>took Bread, gave Thanks, and Brake it; saying, Take, Eat, this is my Body which is broken for you, This do in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me.</hi> And then; <hi>After the same Manner he took the Cup, saying, This Cup is the New Testament in my Blood; This do ye, as oft


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:33743:87"/>
as ye drink it, in Remembrance of me.</hi> 1 Cor. xi.24, 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> For what End did Christ appoint these <hi>Outward Signs</hi> of this <hi>Sacrament</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Words of his <hi>Institution</hi> plainly shew it; that those who celebrate this Sacrament, might <hi>Eat</hi> of the <hi>One,</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> of the <hi>Other,</hi> at his Table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it necessary for all those who join in this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> both to <hi>Eat</hi> of that <hi>Bread,</hi> and to <hi>Drink</hi> of that <hi>Cup</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is so necessary that they cannot,<note place="margin">1. Cor xi 25. Mat. xxvi.27.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violating our <hi>Saviour's Institution,</hi> come to to the Holy Table, unless they do it. For Christ appointed Both to be taken; and he who takes not the <hi>Cup,</hi> as well as <hi>Bread,</hi> does not <hi>Communicate</hi> in <hi>Christ's Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> May not a Person who only looks on, and sees the <hi>Priest Officiate, Commemorate Christ's Death,</hi> and <hi>meditate</hi> upon the <hi>Benefits</hi> of it, as well as if he received the <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I will answer your Question with Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: May not a Person who is not <hi>Baptized,</hi> when he sees that <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> administred, be truly <hi>penitent</hi> for his <hi>Sins,</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi>; and <hi>desire</hi> to be <hi>Regenerated,</hi> and <hi>Adopted</hi> into the <hi>Communion</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi>; as fully as if he were himself <hi>wash'd</hi> with the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Baptism</hi>? But yet the bare looking on, in this Case, would not intitule such a One to the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Regeneration</hi>; nor will it any more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titule the <hi>Other,</hi> to the <hi>Communion</hi> of <hi>Christ's Body</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi> In all these Cases, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is not what we think we might do, but what Christ has commanded us to do: And we must observe what he Requires, if ever we mean


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:33743:88"/>
to be made Partakers of what he Promises. Now that in the present Instance is not idly to look on; but to <hi>do this</hi>; i. e. to <hi>Eat this Bread,</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> of <hi>this Cup,</hi> in <hi>Remembrance of Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Do you think it necessary that <hi>Every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant</hi> should Receive this Sacrament in <hi>Both Kinds</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I do think it Necessary; for so our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour has appointed it. Thus he gave it to his Disciples, and thus they Received it at his Hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But his <hi>Disciples</hi> were <hi>Priests,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Receiving this <hi>Sacrament</hi> in <hi>both Kinds,</hi> does not argue, that it is necessary for the <hi>People</hi> to do likewise?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Whether all who were then present at the <hi>Table</hi> with our Saviour were <hi>Priests,</hi> is very Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. The <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> we are sure, was at that time at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; and, no doubt, did <hi>eat</hi> the <hi>Passover,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. xii.3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> according to the <hi>Law,</hi> with <hi>him</hi>; yet she was certainly but a <hi>Lay Communicant.</hi> And many Others, for ought we know, there might be in the same Circumstances. But not to insist upon this; Our Saviour made no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Lay Communicants,</hi> as to the Business of Receiving of this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in <hi>One,</hi> or <hi>Both Kinds.</hi> He Gave both the <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> himself, to All that were at the <hi>Table</hi>; and He has left a General <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to Us <hi>to do likewise.</hi> And his <hi>Words,</hi> and his <hi>Action</hi> together, evidently require this of all of Us: That those who <hi>Administer</hi> this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> should <hi>Administer</hi> it as <hi>Christ</hi> did; and those who <hi>Receive</hi> it, should <hi>Receive</hi> it as the <hi>Disciples</hi> did of Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:33743:88"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Do you then make no Distinction between the <hi>Priests,</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> in what concerns this Holy Sacrament?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As to the <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Receiving</hi> it, none at all. When those who are <hi>Priests</hi> Receive this Sacrament of another <hi>Priest,</hi> it is as when they hear the <hi>Word Preach'd</hi>: They do it not as <hi>Priests,</hi> but as <hi>Christians.</hi> And therefore at the <hi>Institution</hi> of this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> alone <hi>acted</hi> as a <hi>Priest:</hi> He resembled the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi>; the <hi>Disciples</hi> represented the <hi>Faithful</hi>; who were afterwards to Receive the <hi>Sacrament</hi> from the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> after the very same manner that <hi>They Received</hi> it at <hi>Christ's Hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But is not this <hi>Sacrament</hi> as <hi>Perfect</hi> in <hi>One Kind,</hi> as in <hi>Both?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Can a Thing be <hi>perfect,</hi> which wants one <hi>half</hi> of what is Required to make it <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Yet it cannot be deny'd, but that he who <hi>Receives</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> does therewith <hi>Receive</hi> the <hi>Blood</hi> too?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Though that be not the Question, yet if not only <hi>may be,</hi> but, in this Case, <hi>is,</hi> absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny'd by Us; nor indeed can it, without a manifest Absurdity be affirm'd. It was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of our Saviour Christ in this Sacrament to Represent his <hi>Crucified Body</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. xi.24.</note> his <hi>Body</hi> as it was <hi>Given for Vs.</hi> Now we know that when He suffer'd, his <hi>Blood</hi> was <hi>shed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">—25, 26.</note> and let out of <hi>his Body</hi>; and that to <hi>Represent</hi> his <hi>Blood</hi> thus separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his <hi>Body,</hi> the <hi>Cup</hi> was consecrated apart by Him. And how then can it be pretended that he who Communicates in Such a <hi>Body,</hi> must partake of the <hi>Blood</hi> together with it? But this is not our Business; The Points which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:33743:89"/>
upon are these: First, Whether <hi>Christ</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving confessedly <hi>instituted</hi> this <hi>Sacrament</hi> in <hi>both Kinds,</hi> and commanded Us to <hi>Do likewise</hi>; those do not evidently depart from his <hi>Institution,</hi> who <hi>Give,</hi> and <hi>Receive</hi> it, <hi>only</hi> in <hi>One?</hi> And if they do; Then, Secondly, Whether They have any Reason to expect to be made Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the <hi>Benefits</hi> of this <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> who do not Receive it <hi>after such a Manner,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> has commanded Us to <hi>do</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did the <hi>Apostles</hi> give the <hi>Cup</hi> to the <hi>Lay Communicants</hi> in their <hi>Churches</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, certainly; or else St. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have argued with the <hi>Corinthians</hi> against <hi>Communicating</hi> with <hi>Idolaters</hi> as he does, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x.15, <hi>&amp;c. I speak as to Wise Men, judge ye what I say. The CVP of Blessing which we bless, is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ? — Ye cannot drink the CVP of the LORD, and the Cup of Devils.</hi> Nor have spoken of this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as he does in the next <hi>Chapter:</hi> Ver. 26, 27, 28, 29. In every One of which, He takes notice of their <hi>Drinking</hi> of the <hi>Sacramental CVP,</hi> as well as of their <hi>Eating</hi> of the <hi>Sacramental Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What then do you think of Those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>Cup</hi> to the <hi>Laity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As of a most presumptuous Sort of Men, who Sacrilegiously deprive the People of what Christ has given them a Right to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Do you think this Change so consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as to warrant you to break off <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with that <hi>Church</hi> which has made it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No one can with a good Conscience <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> after any <hi>Other Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> than <hi>Christ</hi> has ordain'd it to be Received. If therefore the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> shall obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Refuse to give it to the <hi>Lay Communicant</hi> in


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:33743:89"/>
                  <hi>Both Kinds,</hi> he is bound in Conscience not to Receive it of her <hi>Priests</hi> at all: But to go to those who are ready to distribute it to them in the same <hi>Integrity,</hi> in which it was first <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted</hi> by our Blessed <hi>Lord.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A. The Body and Blood of Christ, which are verily, and indeed, taken and received by the Faithful in the Lord's Supper.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, they are not; for then every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant, howsoever prepared, or not, for it; would alike Receive <hi>Christ's Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> as to its Substance, there. That which is given by the <hi>Priest</hi> to the <hi>Communicant,</hi> is, as to its <hi>Nature,</hi> the same after Consecration, that it was before; <hi>viz. Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine:</hi> Only alter'd as to its <hi>Vse,</hi> and <hi>Signification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> be not <hi>really given</hi> and <hi>distributed</hi> by the <hi>Priest,</hi> how can they be <hi>verily</hi> and <hi>indeed Taken,</hi> and <hi>Received,</hi> by the <hi>Faithful</hi> Communicant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That which is <hi>given</hi> by the <hi>Priest</hi> is, as to its <hi>Substance, Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine:</hi> As to its <hi>Sacramental Nature,</hi> and <hi>Signification,</hi> it is the <hi>Figure,</hi> or <hi>Representation,</hi> of <hi>Christ's Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi>; which was broken, and shed for Us.

by the <hi>Communicant,</hi> it becomes to Him, by the Blessing of God, and the Grace of the Holy Spirit, the <hi>very Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi> As to those who come Unworthily to it; it is made <hi>Damnation</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. xi.29.</note> that is, it Renders them worthy of it, and, without Repentance, will Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consign them over unto it.</p>

               <p>

by Him in that Sacred Action, that <hi>This is my Body,</hi> &amp;c. and so they are. The <hi>Bread which we break,</hi> is not only in <hi>Figure,</hi> and <hi>Similitude,</hi> but by a <hi>Real, Spiritual Communion,</hi> his <hi>Body:</hi> The <hi>Cup of Blessing which we bless,</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> I know no Other way of <hi>judging</hi> of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Objects,</hi> but by our <hi>Senses.</hi> And if I must not believe what I <hi>See,</hi> and <hi>Taste,</hi> and <hi>Smell,</hi> to be <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi>; to be truly <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi>; I must Resolve to turn Sceptick, and not believe any thing at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is not the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to be more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd upon, than Our <hi>Own Senses?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I do not at all doubt but that We ought, without all Controversy, to <hi>believe</hi> whatever the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> proposes to Us. But where does the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> require me to <hi>believe</hi> any thing in Opposition to my <hi>Senses,</hi> which it is the proper Business of my <hi>Senses</hi> to judge of?</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Does not the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> say, <hi>This is my Body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It does say so of the <hi>Bread,</hi> So <hi>Blessed, Given,</hi> and <hi>Received,</hi> as it ought to be, in this <hi>Sacrament:</hi> And <hi>accordingly I believe</hi> that it is so. But does the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> any where say, that it is not <hi>Bread?</hi> Or that I am not to believe it to be <hi>Bread,</hi> though my <hi>Senses</hi> never so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently assure me that it is?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Can the same Thing be <hi>Christ's Body,</hi> and <hi>Bread,</hi> too?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I have before shewn you not only that it may be so, but that it truly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, is So: <hi>Bread,</hi> in <hi>Substance</hi>; The <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> by <hi>Signification</hi>; by <hi>Representation</hi>; and <hi>Spiritual Communication,</hi> of his <hi>Crucified Body,</hi> to every faithful, and worthy Receiver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> contrary to our <hi>Reason</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As my Reason tells me it is a <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> to say of <hi>One</hi> and the <hi>Same Natural Body,</hi> that it should be in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and on <hi>Earth</hi>; at <hi>London,</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> at the same time. That it should be a true <hi>Humane Body,</hi> and and yet not have any One <hi>Part,</hi> or <hi>Member,</hi> of such a <hi>Body:</hi> To omit a Hundred Other Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, that are the necessary Consequences of Such a Belief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How does the <hi>Scripture</hi> contradict this <hi>Belief?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As it tells us,<note place="margin">Act. i.9, 11. — iii.21. Rom. vi.9, 10. Heb. ix.26, 28.</note> that <hi>Christ's Body</hi> is in <hi>Heaven</hi>; absent from Us: That there it is to <hi>continue</hi> till the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judgment.</hi> That he has now a <hi>Glorified Body,</hi> and is not capable of <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> any more: Whereas the <hi>Body</hi> we Receive, in this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> is his <hi>Crucified Body</hi>; his <hi>Body given</hi> for Us; his <hi>Blood shed</hi> for Us;

which can never be verified in his present <hi>Glorified Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Do not those who believe <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> believe the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to be <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> into <hi>Christ's Mortal,</hi> and <hi>Passible Body</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, they do not; but into that <hi>Body</hi> in which <hi>He now sits at the Right-hand of God</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How then does their Belief of <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi> contradict the Sense of the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> as to what concerns the Nature of <hi>Christ's Body</hi> in the Eucharist?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because by Supposing Christ's <hi>Glorified Body</hi> to be that which we receive in this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> they utterly destroy the very <hi>Nature</hi> of it.<note place="margin">1 Cor. xi.24, 25, 26.</note> It was the Design of this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite,</hi> and <hi>communicate</hi> to Us, the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> not any way, but in the <hi>State</hi> of His <hi>Suffering</hi>; as He was <hi>given for Vs,</hi> and became a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for <hi>our Sins.</hi> Now this he neither was, nor could have been, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, Glorified Estate. So that if the <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> be in this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> it must be not that which he <hi>now has</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> but that which he <hi>then had</hi> when he <hi>Suffer'd</hi> for Us upon <hi>Earth</hi>; and they must not only bring <hi>Christ down</hi> from <hi>above,</hi> but must bring him <hi>back</hi> again to his <hi>mortal,</hi> and <hi>passible</hi> Estate; or they will never be able to make Good any such <hi>Change</hi> as they pretend to; and that, I think, is sufficiently contrary to Scripture, as well as in the Nature of the Thing its self Impossible.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> It were much to be wish'd, that Men would be perswaded to live under the Constant Practice of it; and consider Every Week, or indeed Every Day, how their Accounts stand towards God. But, at least, if they Neglect it at Other Times,<note place="margin">1 Cor. xi.28, 30.</note> yet certainly they ought to do this very nicely, and scrupulously, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to the <hi>Holy Communion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By a Careful, and Diligent Search into our Lives, and Actions; that so we may, if possible, know what the true State of our Souls is, in all those Particulars concerning which we are here directed to Examine our Selves. And this accompanied with Earnest Prayer to God, for his Assistance in, and Blessing upon, our Endeavours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the first Point concerning which we are to <hi>Examine</hi> our Selves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Whether we Repent Us truly of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sins, stedfastly purposing to lead a New Life.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How may we know whether we do this, so effectually as we are here Required to do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We can only judge by the present Frame, and Disposition, of our Souls. If we are hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily Sorry for, and Ashamed of our Sins: If we earnestly Desire God's Forgiveness of them: If we are instant with God in our Prayers for Pardon; and where we have done any Injury to our Neighbour, are ready to ask his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness also, and to make all Reasonable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to him; If, lastly, as far as we can judge of our Selves, we do all this Uprightly, and Sincerely: If we Reserve no secret Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for any Sin in our Souls, but Universally


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:33743:94"/>
Resolve to forsake All our Evil Ways; and in Every Thing to follow the Rules of our Duty; We may, I think, justly conclude, that our Repentance, and Resolutions, are hearty, and without deceit; and, as such, will qualify Us for the worthy Receiving of this Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But what, if after all this, we should Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse into Sin again?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If we do it by Surprise, or Infirmity; if we fall back only into some lesser Sins, and such as will hardly be altogether to be Avoided by us in this present Life; we ought not to be discouraged. But, indeed, if after this we fall into the Commission of some heinous, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate, wasting Sin; but especially should we relapse into a Habit and Course of such Sins; this would be of a dangerous Consequence to Us; and make our last State worse than our first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Would it not therefore be the safest way, rather to abstain altogether from the <hi>Holy Table,</hi> than to Run the Hazard of <hi>Coming Vnworthily</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Were it a Matter of Indifference whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we Ever Received this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or no, this might the more Reasonably be insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but as the Case now stands, is altogether Idle, and Absurd. For, First, To come to the <hi>Holy Table</hi> is a Matter of Express Duty;<note place="margin">Luk. xiv.17, 24. 1 Cor. xi.24, 25.</note> what Christ has commanded us to do; and it is equally dangerous <hi>not to Come at all,</hi> as it is to <hi>Come Vnworthily,</hi> to it. Secondly, By not Coming, we deprive our Selves of the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, which this Sacrament was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to Convey to Us; and in that, of the Greatest Benefit, as well as Comfort, to our


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:33743:94"/>
Souls, in the Course of our Duty, that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion has provided for them. To all which, let me add, Thirdly, That the Shortness, and Uncertainty of our Lives, being consider'd, we ought, upon that Account, to make the same <hi>Preparation</hi> against the <hi>Hour</hi> of our <hi>Death,</hi> that we are Required to do, for <hi>Coming</hi> to the <hi>Holy Table.</hi> And since Men are so very apt to put both the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> and their <hi>Provision for</hi> it so far off; it is an Instance of the Great Mercy and Concern of our Saviour Christ for Us, that by calling us frequently to his <hi>Table,</hi> and Requiring so strict a Preparation for it; he has engaged Us to put our Souls into such a Posture, upon that Account, as will fit them for <hi>Dying</hi>; should we chance, e're we are aware, to be surprized by Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the next Thing wherein we are to <hi>Examine</hi> our Selves, before we come to the <hi>Holy Communion</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Whether we <hi>have a lively Faith in God's Mercy through Christ; i. e.</hi> do stedfastly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that if we do truly Repent Us of our Sins, God will not only most certainly forgive them; but, as an Earnest of it, does here, in this very Sacrament, Ratify, and Seal anew his Covenant with Us; and make us Partakers of the Benefit of that Redemption, which our Blessed Saviour purchased for Us, by the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> of his <hi>Own Body</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Whether we come to it, <hi>with a thankful Remembrance of Christ's Death</hi>; which is therein design'd to be set forth, and shewn by Us. Whether we are sufficiently Sensible of


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:33743:95"/>
the Infinite Love of God, and Condescension of Jesus Christ, hereby declared to Us? Whether we are careful always to keep up in our Minds, a lively Memory of his Death, and Passion? And do, by the Sincerity of our Love to God, and the Zeal we have for our Duty, endeavour, in some measure, to testify how hearty a Sense we have of those unspeakable Mercies which he has been pleased thereby to favour Us withal.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is this all that is Required of Us, before we come to the Lord's Supper?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Other Exercises there are, which may profitably be made Use of by Us, in order to our better Performance of those Duties we have before mentioned. Such are, Some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Devotion:</hi> A <hi>Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> from the <hi>Business,</hi> and <hi>Conversation,</hi> of the World; but especially from the Follies, and Vanities of it. And these accompanied with some <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Mortification,</hi> whilst we are making the <hi>Examination</hi> of our Selves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proposed. But these must be govern'd by the Rules of <hi>Prudence</hi>; as every Man's Business; Opportunities; Needs; State of Health, and the like Circumstances, either Require, or will allow of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:33743:95"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is such a Preparatory <hi>Examination</hi> of our Selves, so necessary before we Come to the Holy Table, that we may, in no Case, presume to Come without it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, it is not: Those who live in a Strict, and Regular Course of Life, and have nothing extraordinary happen'd to. Them, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways know what their State towards God is, so are they always Ready to Receive this Holy Sacrament; and need not be afraid to partake of it, because they had not the Opportunity of making a particular, previous Preparation of themselves for it.

                  <hi>A.</hi> I mean the Solemn <hi>laying on of the Hands</hi> of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> upon such as have been <hi>Baptized,</hi> and are <hi>come to Years of Discretion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is this performed among Us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is directed to be done after a very Wise, and Solemn Manner. For, First, The <hi>Bishop</hi> having given Notice to the <hi>Minister</hi> of his Intention to <hi>Confirm,</hi> and Appointed a <hi>Time</hi> for the doing of it; the <hi>Minister</hi> is to call together such of his <hi>Parish,</hi> as are Come to <hi>Years of Discretion,</hi> and have not yet been <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi>; and to Examine them in their <hi>Church-Catechism,</hi> and to prepare as many as he can for the <hi>Bishop</hi> to <hi>Confirm.</hi> Secondly, Having done this, he is either to bring, or send in Writing, with his Hand Subscribed thereunto, the <hi>Names</hi> of, all such <hi>Persons,</hi> within his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,</hi> as he shall think fit to be presented to the <hi>Bishop</hi> to be <hi>Confirm'd.</hi> These being <hi>Approved</hi>


                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:33743:96"/>
of by the <hi>Bishop,</hi> are brought openly into the <hi>Church,</hi> and Required by the <hi>Bishop,</hi> 
                  <q>in the Presence of God, and the Congregation there Assembled, to <hi>Renew</hi> the <hi>Solemn Vow,</hi> and <hi>Promise,</hi> which was made in their <hi>Names,</hi> at their <hi>Baptism</hi>; and, in their Own Persons, to <hi>Ratify</hi> and <hi>Confirm</hi> the <hi>same</hi>; acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves <hi>bound</hi> to <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> all those Things which their <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers</hi> then <hi>undertook</hi> for them.</q>
Which having done, the <hi>Bishop</hi> heartily prays to <hi>God</hi> for his <hi>Grace</hi> to enable them to fulfil this their Vow; and laying his Hand severally on Every One's Head,
<q>
                     <hi>Beseeches God to</hi> defend this His Servant with his heavenly Grace, that He may Continue His for Ever; and daily Increase in his Holy Spirit more and more, until He comes to his Everlasting Kingdom.</q>
To all which are finally added the Joint <hi>Prayers</hi> both of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> to the same Effect; and so the <hi>Ceremony</hi> is ended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the Reasons that chiefly moved the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to Retain such a <hi>Ceremony</hi> as this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There may several be assigned, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially these <hi>Four: * Apostolical Practice</hi>; * The <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of the <hi>Thing</hi> its <hi>self</hi>; * The <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> of it to the <hi>Person</hi> who is <hi>Confirmed</hi>; and * The Satisfaction that arises from hence to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did the <hi>Apostles</hi> Practise such an <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Hands</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Apostles</hi> did <hi>lay their Hands</hi> on those who had been <hi>Baptized</hi>; and by their <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> such Persons did <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost.</hi> Acts viii.17. xix.6.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Does the <hi>Bishop give</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> now, as the <hi>Apostles</hi> did, by their <hi>Imposition of Hands?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we do not say; nor did the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves <hi>do it.</hi> They <hi>Laid on</hi> their <hi>Hands,</hi> and <hi>God Gave</hi> his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to those on whom they <hi>Laid them.</hi> And we piously presume, that by the fervent <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> those on whom He now <hi>Lays his Hands,</hi> shall also <hi>Receive</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> if they do but worthily prepare Themselves for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is there any <hi>Promise</hi> of <hi>God</hi> on which to build such a Hope?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A General One there is, and such as may in this Case, above any, be depended upon by Us. For, First, We are directed to <hi>Pray</hi> not only for <hi>Our Selves,</hi> but for <hi>One Another</hi> also.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> From the <hi>Condition</hi> of those who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>Baptized</hi> among Us; and who being, for the most part, <hi>Infants,</hi> and so constrain'd to make Use of <hi>Others</hi> to become <hi>Sureties</hi> for them at their <hi>Baptism</hi>; it was certainly very Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that there should be some <hi>Solemn Time</hi> appointed, when such Persons (being come to <hi>Years</hi> of <hi>Discretion</hi>) should Themselves <hi>Ratify</hi> their <hi>Baptismal Covenant</hi>; and Acknowledge their <hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> what their <hi>Godfathers,</hi> and <hi>Godmothers,</hi> had before <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for them.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Besides the <hi>Benefit</hi> of <hi>God's Grace,</hi> which we reasonably presume to be hereby procured to such Persons, by the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> on their behalf; these Two Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages do Evidently accrue to Them: That, First, They are, by this means, secured of the <hi>Care</hi> of their <hi>Godfathers,</hi> and <hi>Godmothers,</hi> to see that they be duly Instructed in the <hi>Principles</hi> of their <hi>Christian Religion</hi>; and in which, were this <hi>Ordinance</hi> strictly observed, they could not be deficient, without being certainly <hi>found out,</hi> and <hi>censured</hi> by the <hi>Church</hi> for their neglect. And, Secondly, That by being thus Solemnly called upon to <hi>Ratify</hi> their <hi>Baptismal Vow,</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi>; They are engaged to begin betimes, both to <hi>Consider</hi> their <hi>Duty,</hi> and to <hi>apply</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the <hi>serious Discharge</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:33743:98"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How does this <hi>Ordinance</hi> give a <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as to these Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> As, by this means, Care is taken to have all these Things Openly transacted before it. The <hi>Person,</hi> who perhaps was <hi>privately Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi> being Now <hi>publickly Confirmed,</hi> in the Face of the Congregation.

And, lastly, The <hi>Godfathers,</hi> and <hi>Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> who became Sureties, both for the <hi>Good Instruction,</hi> and <hi>Education,</hi> of the Person, whom they Answer'd for; being hereby fully <hi>acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> and <hi>discharged,</hi> of their Trust; and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have <hi>faithfully Fulfilled,</hi> what they had so <hi>sacredly Promised,</hi> and <hi>Vndertook</hi> to <hi>Do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Do you look upon all <hi>Godfathers,</hi> and <hi>Godmothers,</hi> to be Obliged to see, that Those for whom they <hi>Answer,</hi> be first duly <hi>Instructed</hi> in the <hi>Principles</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> and then brought to be <hi>Confirmed</hi> by the <hi>Bishop</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are certainly <hi>Obliged,</hi> as far as a <hi>Solemn Promise, made</hi> in the <hi>Presence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and in a Matter not only <hi>Lawful,</hi> but <hi>Pious,</hi> and <hi>Charitable,</hi> can <hi>Oblige</hi> them. Nor can I imagine, how any One, Who has taken such an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Himself, will ever be Able to answer it, either to <hi>God,</hi> or his <hi>Own Conscience,</hi> if He shall neglect to fulfil what He undertook in that behalf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What think you of Those who <hi>Come</hi> to the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> without either being <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi>;


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:33743:98"/>
or having any <hi>Desire,</hi> or <hi>Intention,</hi> to be <hi>Confirmed</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are doubtless to be blamed: Inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as thereby they not only <hi>break</hi> the <hi>Orders,</hi> and <hi>disobey</hi> the <hi>Command</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; which, for such Good Reasons as we have seen, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them to be <hi>Confirmed</hi>; but seem ashamed to Own their <hi>Christian Profession</hi>; and to despise the <hi>Prayers</hi> of their <hi>Bishop</hi> for such <hi>Graces,</hi> as they certainly ought to <hi>Desire</hi>; and cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably Hope, by any more effectual means, to <hi>obtain</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> than by a <hi>Pious,</hi> and <hi>Reverend</hi> Participation, of this <hi>Holy Ordinance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> May not the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> be Obtain'd as well by our <hi>Own Prayers,</hi> as by the <hi>Bishop's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Hands</hi> upon Us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That is not the <hi>Question:</hi> We know that God has promised his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to Every One who faithfully <hi>Prays</hi> for Him. But the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> is this; First, Whether if a Man may Obtain this <hi>Grace</hi> by his <hi>Own Prayers alone,</hi> He may not expect more certainly to do it, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> to them? And, Secondly, Whether He who <hi>Carelesly Neglects,</hi> or <hi>Presumptuously Despises</hi> the <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; and the Pious Provision made by Her, for all Her Members, at their first setting out into the <hi>Dangers,</hi> and <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> of the <hi>World</hi>; may not justly fear, lest God should <hi>Refuse</hi> that <hi>Grace</hi> to his Own <hi>Solitary Prayers,</hi> for which He <hi>Neglected,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,</hi> the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> on his behalf?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is Required of <hi>Persons</hi> to be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:33743:99"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First, That they be of <hi>Years of Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> That is to say, Of a Capacity to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Nature of their <hi>Baptismal Covenant.</hi> What God therein Promises to Us? And what we are thereby Obliged to <hi>Believe,</hi> and <hi>Do,</hi> in Obedience to his Will? Secondly, That They be not only <hi>Capable</hi> of this <hi>Knowledge</hi>; but be <hi>Actually Instructed</hi> in these Things. Thirdly, That being hereby brought to a Clear Sense of what was done for them, by their <hi>Godfathers,</hi> and <hi>Godmothers,</hi> at their <hi>Baptism</hi>; They be now <hi>Ready,</hi> and <hi>Desirous,</hi> in their <hi>Own Persons,</hi> to <hi>Ratify,</hi> and <hi>Confirm</hi> the same. And, lastly, That in Testimony of their sincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions to make Good what they here Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and Vow, they do now truly <hi>Repent</hi> of All their <hi>Sins,</hi> and stedfastly <hi>Resolve,</hi> by the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to Go on in a Constant Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God's Commands, unto their Lives End.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> At what <hi>Times</hi> ought such Persons to be <hi>Confirmed</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> At such Times as the <hi>Bishop</hi> appoints for this Purpose. Only, if it be possible, they should endeavour to be <hi>Confirmed,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fully take upon themselves the <hi>First Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; before they proceed to the Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Second.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How often ought any <hi>Christian</hi> to be <hi>Confirmed</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Office</hi> plainly shews it. <hi>Confirmation,</hi> as it is understood, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised by Us, is nothing Else but a <hi>Solemn Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi> of our <hi>Baptismal Covenant.</hi> Now no Man ought to be <hi>Baptized</hi> more than <hi>Once:</hi> Nor will He therefore need any more than <hi>Once,</hi>


                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:33743:99"/>
to take that Covenant upon Himself. If after this, He shall fall into any Sins, whereby to put Himself out of a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi>; Or even to be cut off from the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; there are Other means of Restoring him again to Both, upon his Sincere <hi>Repentance</hi> for what He has done Amiss.
