            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

he had loſt both his people and game, commending himſelfe to God, he began to make ſumwhat the more haſt, til hauing trauerſed firſt one way and then another, at the very entrance into a Wood, he ſaw two Knights fighting againſt one. Soone had he knowledge of the twaine, in that they were his owne Subiects, of whome he had heard ſundry complaintes: but ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der order was taken in the cauſe, by rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>on of the great alliance they had in the Country, as alſo for that they kept themſelues ſtill in this greatforreſt. Who the third ſhould be, he meruailed, and for that time he ſo well liked the valour of the one Knight, as he feared not what might happen to the other twaine: wherefore he withdrew himſelfe a little further into the Forreſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he might the better beholde the iſſue of the fight, which ſorted to ſuch effect, as by the ſtrength of the one Knight, both the other were vanquiſhed and ſlaine. The King beholding what had happened, came forth of the Wood, when the Knight ſeeing one ſo neere him alone, thus demaunded. Gentle Sir, what Country is this, where Knightes errant are thus aſſayled by robbers and theeues; Let this be no wonder to you Sir, anſwered the King, for this Country yeelds as others doe, both good and bad: as for them that thus aſſaulted you, they haue done diuers &amp; villainous outrages, not only in this Wood, which hath been their accuſtomed receptacle: but likewiſe in many other places, and cheefely againſt their Lord &amp; King, who could not execute iuſtice on them, in that they were allyed to the beſt houſes in this Realme. And where may I find the King you ſpeake of; ſaid the Knight, for I am come to ſeeke him, to bring him newes from a great friend of his. Happen what ſhall, anſwered <hi>Garinter,</hi> I will tell ye ſo much as I know: vnderſtand then for a truth, that I am the man you aske for. At theſe words the Knight tooke off his Helmet, and throwing downe his Sheeld, ran to embrace him: ſaying that he was King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> who of long time had been deſirous to know him. Greatly were theſe Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, that their meeting was in ſuch fortunate manner, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring together on many matters, they tooke the waye through the Wood toward the Citie, where they thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But it fell out otherwiſe, for in the purſuit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as they came into the thickeſt of the Wood, a chaſed Lyon ran before them: which in their ſight ſeazed on the Hart, and hauing with his ſtrong pawes torne it in peeces, turned againe, when running furiouſly againſt the two Princes, he watched his aduantage, as if they had angred him, which the King <hi>Perion</hi> perceiuing, in laughter ſaide. You ſhall not be ſuch a glutton, maiſter Lyon, but you ſhall leaue vs parte of the game. And herewith preſently he alighted, becauſe his Horſe would not come nere the beaſt, ſo draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Swoord, and claſping his ſheeld on his arme, not regarding the cryes of King <hi>Garinter,</hi> who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to diſſwade him from the attempt, he marched to the Lyon, who for defence of his pray, ran eagerly againſt the King, and ſo betweene them began a new warre. But the Lyon being quicke and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7179:4"/>
nimble, did ſo much as he got his enemy vnder him, yet was the Kinges heart ſo good, that albeit he was in very great perill of his perſon, he was not abaſhed one iotte: but turned himſelfe in ſuch ſorte, as he thruſt his Swoord into the belly of the beaſt, which at that inſtant fel downe dead before him. The King ſeeing what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, was ſo ouercome with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing at this deed as he ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him ſelfe. In ſooth it is no ſhame to renowne one of the beſt Knights in the worlde. In this meane while, the reſt of the traine came thether, who for to finde their king, had ſearched long time vp and downe the Forreſt. Then was their pray and Veniſon laid on two horſes, and caryed to the Citie, where the Queene was immediatly aduertiſed of king <hi>Perions</hi> arriuall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made ſpeedy prouiſion of all things neceſſarye, to welcome and feaſte ſo great a Prince. At their coming they found Dinner ready, and the tables couered: wherfore (after the welcomes and reuerences done on all ſides) the two kinges ſat downe, ſo did the Queene, and faire <hi>Eliſena</hi> her Daughter. Now had loue ſecretly ambuſhed him-ſelfe, becauſe he had long time aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled this yong Princeſſe, without any power to ouercome her: but now he ſaw her ſo vnprouided, as at this inſtant hower he might touch her to the quick, and thence forwarde hold a ſure conqueſt of her. The like in king <hi>Perion,</hi> who thought of nothing but a friendly entertainment, yet when he caſt his eye on the Lady <hi>Eliſena,</hi> &amp; ſhe in like ſorte vpon him: by vertue of this pearcing regarde, her wonted chaſte and holye life, had no longer power to priuiledge this Princeſſe, but ſhe was wonderfully thralled in extreame loue to this yong king, and he in ſelfe ſame manner to her, albeit till that hower, he had his hart francke and free, without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection in any other place. In this ſorte during dinner tyme, they found themſelues (for each other) in a ſtrange opinion, till the tables were with drawen, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Queene would departe to her Chamber, wherefore <hi>Eliſena</hi> aroſe to follow her: but as ſhe ſtepped forward, ſhe let fall a Ring which ſhe had put in her boſome when ſhe waſht her handes, and ſo had forgot it, by reaſon of this new loue, that made her thinke on other matters. Now was king <hi>Perion</hi> ſomewhat neer her, and deſirous to let her know how willingly he would be hers, ſtooped downe as ſoone as ſhe to take it vp, and ſo right did their handes meete together, as the king had the meane to cloſe her fingers, yet feigning to take vp her Ring. Wherevpon this amourous Lady began to change collour, and (notwithſtanding) by a ſweete regard humbly th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained was <hi>Eliſena</hi> (without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering him) to follow the Queen her mother, ſo ſurprized &amp; altered, as very neere ſhe had forgoten her ſelfe: ſo that not able to endure this new fire of loue (which ſo ſudden &amp; vehemently had conquered her wonted chaſte and choice determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:) with the teares in her eyes, and her hart full of anguiſh, ſhee went and diſcouered the ſame to a faithful Damoſeloſhers, named <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rtoletta,</hi> praying her moſt inſtantly to councel her, how ſhe might ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, if King <hi>Perion</hi> had not elſe-where placed his loue, and whether the affectionate ſemblaunce he had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7179:5"/>
ſhowne her, might proceed from force of that impreſſion, which had ſo lately ſeazed on her hart. The Damoſell meruailing at this ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den mutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; in a perſon thought ſo farre from any ſuch matter: ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (neuertheleſſe) compaſſion on her piteous teares, thus anſwered. I ſee well Madame, that according to the extreame paſſion, wherewith the tirant Loue hath tormented ye, he hath left no place in your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where counſell or reaſon may be entertained: and therefore following not what I ought for your ſeruice, but the will I haue to obey you, I ſhall do what you haue commaunded me, by the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt meanes that my little diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and great deſire I haue to pleaſe ye, will permit me. So without any more woords, <hi>Darioletta</hi> went to the Chamber where King <hi>Perion</hi> was, and at the doore ſhe found his Squire, who brought other gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for his Lord to weare, which the Damoſell tooke of him. For (quoth ſhe) it is neceſſary that I performe this ſeruice, and you (gentle Squire) may goe if you pleaſe about your other affaires. The Squire thinking it was the cuſtome of the Country, made no deniall, but willingly ſuffered her to take the Garments, whereupon ſhe entred the Chamber, where ſhe found the King laid on his bed: who ſeeing her enter, and knowing well it was ſhe, whom he had ſeene to conferre with <hi>Eliſena</hi> moſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly, &amp; in whom (aboue al other) ſhe put chiefeſt truſt, he thought that ſhe wold not come in that ſort to him, without bringing him ſome remedy for his mortall paſſions, for which cauſe, all in trembling, he ſaid. Faire friend, what demand ye; If it may ſo like you my Lord, quoth ſhe, I haue brought other garments for ye. Much rather would I, ſaid the King, that you had brought ſome comfort to my hart, which at this preſent is left &amp; deſpoyled of all pleaſure. As how my good Lord; anſwered the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell. Thus quoth he. When firſt I arriued in this country, I was free from all paſſions, and doubted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but of aduentures that might happen to Knights errand: but now (I know not in what ſort) entring this Court, by ſome one of your Ladyes, haue I receiued a deadly wound, for which if you (faire Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell) know how to giue me any remedy, your recompence ſhall be ſo good, as you ſhall repute your ſelfe beholding to me. Certes, quoth ſhe, I ſhould imagine my ſelfe happy, by doing ſeruice to ſo high a perſonage, and ſo good a Knight as you are, if I could tell wherein. If you wil promiſe me ſaid the King, as you are a loyall Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, not to diſcouer me but where it is requiſite, I ſhall tell ye. Say boldly your pleaſure, anſwered <hi>Darioletta,</hi> for by me (without your liking) it ſhall not be knowen to any. Damoſell and my friend, quoth he, I giue you to vnderſtand, that at what time I beheld the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent beauty of <hi>Eliſena</hi> your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, I became extreamely tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with her loue, and in ſuch ſorte, as I cannot excuſe my ſelfe from death, if I find not remedy for my greefe the ſooner. <hi>Darioletta</hi> (who knew thorowly the mind of the Princeſſe) hearing what the King had ſaide, returned him this anſwer. My Lord, if you will aſſure me by the faith of a King, which before all other things ought to be kept, as a perſon moſt bounden to vertue, and as a loyall Knight, who ought (as is ſaide) to ſuffer much, for maintenance of right
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7179:5"/>
and equitie, that you will take to wife my Lady <hi>Eliſena</hi> when time ſhall ſerue: right ſoone will I bring ye to the place, where not only your hart ſhalbe ſatisfied but hers like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, who (it may be) is in as much or more thought and dolour, then you are, by reaſon of the new an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh that toucheth her thorow the ſelfe ſame meanes. But if you do not (my Lord) what I haue ſaid, you ſhall not there recouer her, not ſhall I haue other cauſe then to thinke, that your words proceeded from no loyall hart, nor to credit any thing you ſay hereafter. The King whome loue had already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of liberty, to vnite him ſelfe with <hi>Eliſena,</hi> (to the end that hee might be adorned with the great &amp; gratious fruite, which afterwarde happened, as ſhalbe recited vnto ye,) tooke his Swoord, and ſetting his right hand on the Croſſe there-of, ſaide theſe wordes. I ſweare by this Croſſe, and on this Sword, wherewith I receiued the order of Knighthood, to do what you (faire Damoſell) ſhall commaund mee, at all times, and when ſoeuer your miſtreſſe <hi>Eliſena</hi> ſhalbe thereto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed. Be you then frollicke &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, anſwered <hi>Darioletta,</hi> for I ſhall likewiſe accompliſh what I haue promiſed. And at that inſtant ſhee returned to the Princeſſe, declaring to her what ſhee had concluded with king <hi>Perton,</hi> wherewith the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Lady was ſo pleaſed, as ſhe had vtterly loſt her former coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and inceſſantly embracing <hi>Darioletta,</hi> thus demaunded. My deere friend, when will the hower come, that I ſhall holde betweene mine armes, my Lord whom thou haſt giuen me? I ſhall tel ye anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Damoſell, you know that in the Chamber where King <hi>Perion</hi> lodgeth, there is a doore on the Garden ſide, which your father ſundry times vſed for his recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; which at this preſent is couered with the cloth of Arras, but I haue the key thereof: wherfore at night when euery one is at reſt, we may eaſily there enter vnſeene of any, and when needfull time of returne cometh, my ſelfe will call ye. When <hi>Eliſena</hi> heard this deuice, ſhe was highly contented therewith, yet breathing forth a ſighe, ſhe ſaid. Alas my faithfull friend: how ſhall we bring this to paſſe? ſeeing my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is determined to lodge with King <hi>Perion:</hi> &amp; if he perceiue vs, we ſhalbe both in very great danger. Refer that doubt to me, anſwered <hi>Darioletta,</hi> &amp; I ſhal eaſily prouide for this matter: wherupon for this time they brake off conference, becauſe the tabels were couered for Supper. And in like manner as the feaſting began in the morning, ſo now it continued, till the tables beeing voyded, each one prepared himſelf to reſt. Now a little before, <hi>Dariolet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> went to King <hi>Perions</hi> Squire, &amp; thusſaide to him. Gentle Squire, &amp; my friend I pray ye tel me in good faith, whether you be a Gentleman or no, why aske ye? anſwered the Squire. For the deſire I haue, ſaid the Damoſell, to know one thing of you which I entreat ye (by the faith you owe to God and to the King your Maiſter) not to hide from me. By Saint Mary, quoth he, I will tell you what you pleaſd to aske, prouided, that it be not to the domage of my Lord. Herein, ſaide the Damoſell will I conſent with ye, for I would not demaund any thing of you that ſhould giue him diſpleaſure, nor were it reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that you ſhould acquaint me with any ſuch matter: but I deſire to know, who is the Lady he loueth moſt perfectly. The king my Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7179:6"/>
quoth the Squire, loueth all ingenerall, and I aſſure ye, that I know no one, to whom he beareth ſuch affection as you ſpeake of.</p>
                  <p>While they were thus talking, the King <hi>Garinter</hi> came, who ſeeing <hi>Darioletta</hi> conferring with King <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions</hi> Squire, demanded what ſhee had to do with the Gentleman? In ſooth my Lord quoth ſhe, he telles me that the King his Maiſter is wont to lye alone, and therefore I thinke he loueth not to haue any company. When <hi>Garinter</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that, he went preſently to King <hi>Perion,</hi> ſaying, My noble Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there are certaine affaires ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly befallen me, and likewiſe I muſt riſe ſomewhat early in the morning, which hath made me thinke, that (not to trouble you) the beſt way is, that I breake com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany from lodging with ye. My Lord, anſwered king <hi>Perion,</hi> do as ſhall ſeeme beſt to your liking, this anſwer appeared to king <hi>Garin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> conformable with that the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell had ſaid, wherefore right ſoone he commaunded his bed to be fetcht from king <hi>Perions</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. When <hi>Darioletta</hi> heard there-of, ſhee imagined their affaires would fall out the better, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore returned to <hi>Eliſena,</hi> acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her with all that had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two kinges.

Theſe words ſhe vttered with ſuch affection, that ſhe trembled like the little leafe on the high tree, and as ſhe ended thoſe ſpeeches, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued at the Chamber doore where King <hi>Perion</hi> was lodged: who (for the ſtrangnes of this new amorous flame, as alſo the hope he had in <hi>Darioletta)</hi> had not as yet taken any reſt. Neuertheleſſe, beeing as then wearye with trauaile, &amp; ouercome with ſleepe: began (euen as they opened the doore) to ſlumber, and dreamed that one entred his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at a falſe dore, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge who it ſhould be: but he thought that he thruſt his hands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſides, and rent forth his hart, afterward he ſaw him throw it into the Riuer, when the king ſaide.

For this cauſe in feare he ſtarted out of bed, tooke his Sword, and went to the place where he had ſeene them: but when <hi>Darioletta</hi> ſaw him ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, ſhe ſpake to him in this manner, What ſhalbe done here? Do you draw armes againſt vs, that come to you with ſo ſlender defence? the king who quickly knew them, eſpecially <hi>Eliſena</hi> whom hee ſo much deſired, threw his Sword to the ground, and caſting a mantle about him which lay neere at hand: in great affection hee came to her, whom he loued better then him-ſelfe, kiſſing, embracing &amp; ſhewing the beſt countenance could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, which <hi>Darioletta</hi> ſeeing, as one iealous and enuious of ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, ſaid to <hi>Eliſena.</hi> Now are you ſomewhat better contented, for in my iudgement, although till this time you defended your ſelfe from many.

(after many amourous embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, infinite kiſſings, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of delights) he behelde, verily perſwading himſelfe, that all the beauty of the world was in her, reputing himſelfe much more then happy, that the heauens had allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſo good an aduenture. See now how it chaunced to this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, that for ſo long time, in the cheefeſt flower of her youth, beeing requeſted by ſo many mighty Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great Lordes, ſhe had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all, to remaine in the liberty of a Maiden: now won in leſſe ſpace then one day, and at ſuch time as her fancie (in her one thinking) was fartheſt off from ſuch matters.</p>
                  <p>Thus Loue breaking the ſtrong bandes of her holye and chaſt life, cauſed a ſudden alteration of her purpoſe, making her ſoone after, of a faire virgen, a faire woman: ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for example to many other, who aſſaying to withdraw their thoughtes from worldly things, &amp; deſpiſing the great beauty wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with nature hath endowed them, &amp; tender youth, which maketh them ignorant of the pleſures &amp; delights in their Fathers Courts, whereof ſometime they might haue taſted: yeelde themſelues (for ſaluation of their ſoules) in poore and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houſes, thereto in offering their free will, vowing themſelues to the ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of others, hoping to paſſe their time without any renowne or glory of this world. Certes ſuch Ladyes, ought with great ſollicitude to ſtop their eares, cloſe their eyes, and giue themſelues to continuall deuoute contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; prayers, accepting them as their true and ſingular paſtimes, as to ſuch they are: and aboue all, they ſhould exempt themſelues from ſight of Parents neighbours and freinds, becauſe oftentimes the talk and frequenting of ſuch, procureth a change of their holy &amp; chaſt will. and not without cauſe haue I made this little diſcourſe, for it is to the end that it happen not to them, as it did vnto the faire Princeſſe <hi>Eliſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who ſo long labored in thought to preſerue her ſelfe: yet notwith-ſtanding in one only moment, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beauty and good grace of King <hi>Perion,</hi> changed her will in ſuch ſorte, as without the aduiſe &amp; diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Darioletta,</hi> who would couer the honor of hir Miſtreſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mantle of mariage: you may ſee ſhe was at the poynt to fal, into the very loweſt parte of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor.

                  <p>Now then are theſe two louers in their ſolace, <hi>Eliſena</hi> demanding of the king, if his departure ſhould be ſhortly or no.

Haue no doubt thereof ſaide the king, for although my body is ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from your preſence, my hare for euer ſhal remain with ye, which ſhall giue ſtrength to vs both, to you to ſuffer, and to me by my ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye returne. Theſe two contented louers are thus deuiſing, when ſhe that had bin the cauſe of their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (ſeeing it was time to call her miſtreſſe, who by this pleaſure for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got her ſelfe in her louers armes)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7179:7"/>
entred the Chamber, &amp; ſpeaking ſomewhat loude ſaide. Madme, I know that heretofore you thought my company more agreeable, then you doe at this preſent: but it is needfull that you ariſe, and let vs goe, for the time calleth vs. When the King heard her, knowing that perforce it muſt be ſo, he prayed <hi>Darioletta</hi> to walke into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and to bring him word in what corner the winde ſat: in meane while he tooke his amou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conge, with ſuch reciprocall pleaſure, as you that loue may eaſily iudge, then ſweetly kiſſing her, he ſaide, I aſſure you Madame, that for your ſake I will ſtay longer in this Country then you imagine, therefore I pray ye be not vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of this place. So aroſe <hi>Eliſena,</hi> and went to her Chamber with <hi>Darioletta,</hi> leauing the king alone, not a little contented with his new acquaintance: but dreading his dreame, as you haue heard, and willing to know what it might ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, he became deſirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to his owne Country, where as then were good ſtore of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that were well ſeene in thoſe Sciences: himſelfe likewiſe in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times tooke great pleaſure therein, and vnderſtood ſundry rules thereof. Neuertheleſſe, he foiourned ten dayes with king <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinter,</hi> after his ſporting with <hi>Eliſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who neuer a night failed to viſit her louely haunt. The ten dayes being ſpent, king <hi>Perion</hi> (forcing his will, and notwithſtanding the teares and intreaties of <hi>Eliſena</hi> which were exceſſiue) reſolued to depart, and therefore tooke his leaue of the Court: but as he wold haue mounted on horſebacke, he perceiued that he wanted his good Sword; whereat he became ſomewhat offended, becauſe it was one of the beſt, and faireſt in the world, yet durſt he not demand it, fearing leaſt the loue of him and <hi>Eliſena</hi> ſhould thereby be diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or King <hi>Garinter</hi> angry with them that viſited his Chamber. In theſe thoughts, accompanied with infinite regrets, without lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtay, he tooke his way toward <hi>Gaule:</hi> albeit before his departure, <hi>Darioletta</hi> came &amp; intreated him, to be mindfull of the great griefe wherein he left his <hi>Eliſena,</hi> and of the ſolemne promiſe he had made her. Alas my deere friend, ſaide the King, I pray ye to aſſure her on my parte, that ſhe ſhall haue no cauſe of offence, and that right ſoone I meane to ſee her, in meane while, I commend her to you as mine ſowne proper hart. Then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from his finger a Ring, ſemble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to another that he had, he ſent it to the deſolate louer, in treating her earneſtly (for his ſake) to giue it her. This preſent did no whit leſſen her great greefe, but encreaſe it, ſo that if ſhe had not beene comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Darioletta,</hi> without doubt, ſhe had then finiſhed her dayes: but ſo well ſhe perſwaded her to take good hope, that by the alliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhe laid before her of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous occurrences, ſhe came ſome-what better to her ſelfe, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thence forward more ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſſemble her ſorrowe, till ſhe felte her ſelfe great with Childe, by meanes whereof, ſhe not onely loſt the taſte of her food, but alſo the pleaſure of reſt, and the faire cullour of her countenance.</p>
                  <p>Now on the higheſt ſtep of miſ-hap was her ſorrow ſet, and not without cauſe, for in that time was there an inuiolable lawe, that any woman or maiden, of what quality or eſtate ſoeuer, offending in ſuch forte, could no way excuſe her ſelfe

from death. This ſharpe and cruell cuſtome, endured til the comming of the vertuous King <hi>Arthur,</hi> the beſt Prince / that euer raigned in that Country: which he reuoked at the time, as he killed <hi>Floian</hi> in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile before the Gates of <hi>Paris.</hi> But many other Kinges were betweene him and <hi>Garinter,</hi> who maintained that lawe, and for this cauſe the ſorrowfull Lady could not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued by ignoraunce thereof: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that by the oathes and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of King <hi>Perion</hi> on his Sword, God would remit the offence, yet knew ſhe not how to excuſe her faulte to the worlde, becauſe it was done ſo ſecretly as you haue heard. See here the diſtreſſe wherein King <hi>Perion</hi> left his <hi>Eliſena,</hi> which g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of this ſuccour, ſhe thought there was no remedy for her life, for which ſhe made not ſo much mone, as the loſſe of the ſight of her true friend and onely Lord. But at that inſtant the great and puiſſant maker of all thinges, by whoſe permſſion this act was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to his ſeruice, inſpired <hi>Darioletta</hi> with ſuch councell, as ſhe onely ſhould remedie theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currances, in ſuch ſort as you ſhall preſently vnderſtand.</p>
                  <p>In the pallace of King <hi>Garinter,</hi> there was a Chamber-vault ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the reſt, neere to which was a riuer, whereto one might eaſily diſcend by a little Iron dore, this Chamber (by the aduice of <hi>Darioletta)</hi> did <hi>Eliſena</hi> requeſt of her father, as well for her eaſe, as to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue her accuſtomed ſolitary life, and would haue none other companion then <hi>Darioletta,</hi> who (as you haue heard) knew the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her dollorous greefes. This requeſt ſhe lightly obtained, the King thinking his daughters intent to be as ſhe feigned, and heereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was the keye of the Iron dore giuen to <hi>Darioletta,</hi> to open when it pleaſed <hi>Eliſena</hi> to recreate her ſelfe on the water. By this meane had ſhe a place proper to her affaires, and ſo was in better reſt &amp; aſſurance then before: for well was ſhe aduiſed, that in this place more commodiouſly then any other, might ſhe prouide to eſcape with-out danger. Wherefore beeing there one day alone with her Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, they fell in conference, &amp; ſhe required councell, what ſhould be done with the fruite that ſhe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed withall. What? anſwered <hi>Darioletta:</hi> Mary, it muſt ſuffer to redeeme you. Oh poore maidenly mother, ſaide <hi>Eliſena,</hi> how can I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent to the death of the creature, begoten by the only man of the worlde, whome moſt I loue? offend not your ſelfe, quoth <hi>Darioletta,</hi> for if you ſhould dye, hardly would it be permitted after you to liue. In ſooth, ſaide <hi>Eliſena,</hi> although I dye beeing culpable, it were no reaſon the little innocent ſhould ſuffer. Leaue we this talke, anſwered <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioletta,</hi> ſeeing it were great folly to hazard the ſafety of that, which hereafter may be the onely cauſe of your loſſe, and your friend likewiſe: for well you knowe, that if you be diſcouered, you ſhall dye, and the infant ſhall not liue, &amp; you dying, no longer can he liue that ſo deere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loueth you. So ſhall you alone cauſe the death of all three, where
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7179:8"/>
contrarywiſe, if you eſcape the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, the time will come, when you may haue together children enow, which will make you forget the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection you bare to this firſt. And as this Damoſell was thus inſpired, ſo would ſhe before hand ſeeke to preuent the inconuenience, in this manner. She got foure little boards, of ſuch largenes as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make a Cheſt wherein to put the infant, with the clothes &amp; the Sword which ſhe kept, then did ſhe giue them together in ſuch ſorte, as the water ſhould haue no place to enter. This beeing done &amp; made fit, ſhe put it vnder the bed, without declaring any thing there-of to <hi>Eliſena,</hi> vntil the time of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth approched, and then <hi>Dario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta</hi> ſaide. What thinke ye Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame this little Cofer is made for? In good faith I know not, quoth ſhe. This ſhalbe to ſerue vs, ſaide the Damoſell, when we haue need. Beleeue me anſwerd <hi>Eliſena</hi> wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, but little doe I care for any thing that may happen, for I feele my ſelfe too neere the loſſe of my good, and all my ioy. Very ſoone after, the Princeſſe felt the anguiſh of traualle, which was to her very ſtrange &amp; troubleſome, oppreſſing her hart with ſundry bitter paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: yet notwithſtanding al her yrkſome plunges, poore ſoule ſhe durſt not but be ſilent, greatly fearing leaſt ſhe ſhould be heard. Her agonies thus redoubling, the moſt mighty (with-out danger of her perſon) gaue her in deliuerance a faire Son, which the Damoſell receiued, and as ſhe held it, it ſeemed to her of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full feature, and happy would ſhe haue reputed him, had he not bene borne to hard fortune, where-to <hi>Darioletta</hi> was conſtrained to ſend him, for the redemption of the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull mother, and therefore ſhe deferred it not. But euen as before was concluded, ſhe wrapped the infant in riche clothes, and after-ward brought it with the Cofer to <hi>Eliſena:</hi> which when the good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſawe, ſhe demanded what ſhe would do therewith. Madame quoth ſhe, herein ſhall your little Sonne be put, then will I ſend it forth on the water, and if it pleaſe God, he may eſcape and liue. Alas my ſweete infant, ſaide <hi>Eliſena,</hi> how full of danger is thy deſtiny? In meane while, <hi>Darioletta</hi> tooke inke and parchment, and writ therein theſe words, <hi>This is</hi> Amadis <hi>without time, Sonne to a King:</hi> by theſe words without time, ſhe meant, that ſhe thought his death to be neere at hand, and the name of <hi>Amadis</hi> was of great reuerence in that Country, becauſe of a Saint there ſo ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The letter beeing written and ſealed, was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and wrapped in ſilke, &amp; then with a little golden Chaine, faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about the Childes necke, with the Ring that King <hi>Perion</hi> ſent <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſena</hi> at his departure. Each thing thus appointed, <hi>Darioletta</hi> came to the wofull mother, and in her ſight put the Childe into the Cheſt, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by him the King his Fathers Sword, which he threw on the ground the firſt night he came to <hi>Eliſena,</hi> and this is the cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Damoſell had ſo well kept it: then after the Mother had kiſt her Sonne, as her laſt farewell, the Cofer was made faſt very arteficial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and <hi>Darioletta</hi> opening the iron dore, commending the babe to the heauenly protection, ſhe ſet it on the water, the courſe whereof bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſpeedy, full ſoone caried the Cofer into the Sea, which was leſſe then halfe a mile from the place.</p>

Now began the breake of day to appeare, and the little infant fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his fortune, now throwne heere, then there, according as the boyſtrous waues pleaſed: but by the will of the higheſt, who (when he pleaſeth) makes impoſſibilities eaſie, cauſed it ſo to fall out, that at the ſame time as this was done, a Scottiſhe Ship ſayled on the Sea, wherein was a Gentleman named <hi>Gandales,</hi> who from little <hi>Brittaine</hi> ſailed with his wife into <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhe hauing beene lately deliuered of a ſonne called <hi>Gandalin.</hi> The morning was both calme &amp; cleere, wherefore <hi>Gandales</hi> might eaſilye perceiue the Cheſt floting on the waues, which he preſently ſent out for, thinking it to be ſome matter of great value: then the Mariners caſting forth a Skiffe, made toward the Cofer and tooke vp: when they had brought it to <hi>Gandales,</hi> he got open the couer; and beholding the goodly infant within, as alſo the rich clothes wherein it was wrapped, he ſuſpected that it came from no meane place, as he gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the ring &amp; the good Sword. So taking it in his armes, he was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſuch compaſſion, as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to curſſe the mother thereof, who through feare had forſaken ſo cruelly ſuch a beautifull creature: and carefully did he cauſe al things to be kept which he found in the Cofer, deſiring his wife, that this infant might be nouriſhed as his owne Sonne. She was heerewith very wel contented, and ſo the two children were equally foſtered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for neuer had yong <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> ſuckt the teat, but ſo ſoone as it was giuen him by his new nurſſe, he made no refuſall thereof, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very thirſtie ſucked very harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereat <hi>Gandales</hi> and his wife were exceeding glad. Now had they the time ſo fauourable, as ſhortly they landed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> neere to a Citie named <hi>Antallia,</hi> and ſoone after they came to their owne Country, where little <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and the Childe found in the ſea were nouriſhed together.

                  <p>The Lordes and Princes thus aſſembled, the King conferred with them on the eſtate and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Realme, but it was with ſo ſad countenance as could be: for the occaſion of his dreame made him ſo penſiue, as his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes (being abaſhed thereat) were in meruailous doubtes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, after he had giuen them to vnderſtand his will, and appointed all requiſite matters in order, he gaue them leaue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte, ſending each one home to his houſe, only ſtaying with him three Aſtrologers, reputed the moſt skilfull in thoſe actions, and therefore he made choiſe of them.

Thou knoweſt how thou haſt ſworne and promiſed, to tell me what thou haſt found by thy ſkill. Sir anſwered <hi>Albert,</hi> let then the reſt be called into your preſence, for before them will I tel ye. Well haſt thou aduiſed, ſaid the King whereupon they were ſent for, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <hi>Albert</hi> thus began. My opinion is, my Lord, that the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chamber, and him whom you ſaw enter by the ſecret dore, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth this Realme which is cloſe &amp; well guarded: notwithſtanding by ſome right thereto, ſome one ſhall come to take it from you. And like as he thruſt his handes into your ſides, renting forth thence your hart, and afterward threw it into the Riuer: euen ſo ſhall your Townes and Caſtles both more &amp; leſſe, be priuily ſtolen from you, and put into his hand from whom you ſhall not eaſily recouer them. And what meaneth the other hart, ſaid the King, which I dreamed ſhould remain with me, and yet he ſaid, that ſoone after I ſhould loſe it, againſt the will of him that took the firſt from me? It ſeemeth by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7179:10"/>
this, anſwered <hi>Albert,</hi> that ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall inuade your Country as the firſt did, yet conſtrained more by force of another that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to do ſo, then by any will thereto in himſelfe: thus ſee ye (my Lord) all that I can tell ye. Now ſaid the king to the ſecond named <hi>Antalles,</hi> tel vs your aduiſe. Me thinkes Sir, quoth he, that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> hath very well ſaide, and I am of his opinion, except in this, (for ought I can learne, &amp; as the cauſe ſheweth me) that what he ſaith ſhall happen, is already effected, &amp; by the perſon that moſt loueth ye: notwithſtanding I am greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed thereat, ſeeing there is not as yet any part of your Realme loſt, &amp; if you do looſe any thing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, it muſt be by ſuch a one as loueth you deerely. When the king heard this, he nodded his head, for it ſeemed to him, that he came neere the marke: but <hi>Vngan</hi> the <hi>Piccard,</hi> who knew much more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, fel into a laughter, which he was ſildome wont to doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a man very ſad and melancholly, yet (by chance) the King perceiued it, wherefore he ſaid. Maiſter <hi>Vngan</hi> my friend, now remaineth none but you, ſay bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what you haue gathered. My Lord, quoth he, peraduenture I haue ſeene into things, which is not neceſſary to be knowne to any other then your ſelfe, &amp; therefore let theſe giue place a while, if you pleaſe. At theſe words they with-drew themſelues, leauing the King and <hi>Vngan</hi> alone, who thus ſpake.</p>
                  <p>If your Maieſty ſaw me ere while to laugh, it was at one word which little you thinke on, yet it is true, and will you know what? It was that which <hi>Antalles</hi> ſaid, that what he found by your dreame was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy happened, &amp; by the perſon that beſt loueth ye: Now ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale what you keepe in ſecret and thinke that none knowes but your ſelfe. You loue (my Lord) in ſuch a place, where you haue already accompliſhed your will, and ſhe whom you loue is ſurpaſſing faire, then tolde he all the geſts and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions of her, as if ſhe had bene there preſent. But as for the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you found ſhut, you know Sir, full well what it meaneth, and how ſhe whome you loue, deſirous to deliuer her heart and yours from griefe and ſadneſſe: came to ye, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring your cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber by the falſe dore that was hid from you. The hands that opened your ſides, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinction of you twaine: then the heart taken from ye, ſheweth that ſhe hath by you a Son or a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now tell me ſaid the King, what meaneth the caſting thereof into the Riuer? My Lord, quoth he, that nothing concerneth you, therefore neuer labour for further knowledge thereof. Yet would I, ſaid the King, faine vnderſtand it, and therefore feare not to tell me for any harme that may happen. Seeing you will needes haue it, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Vngan,</hi> I beſeech ye Sir aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me while you liue, for any thing that I ſhal reueal, you wilnot be diſpleaſed with her who loueth you ſo loyally. That promiſe do I faithfully make thee, ſaid the King. In good ſooth Sir, quoth <hi>Vngan,</hi> that heart that you ſaw throwen into the water, is the firſt infant ſhe ſhall haue by you, who muſt of neceſſity be forſaken. And the other, ſaid the King, that ſhall remaine with me, what meaneth that? You may, anſwered <hi>Vngan,</hi> vnderſtand by the one, deſſeigne of the other, which is, that ſhe ſhall conceiue another childe, who
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7179:10"/>
ſhall be caryed away againſt the will of her, that cauſed the loſſe of the firſt. Thou haſt told me ſtrange things, ſaid the King, and would God the miſ-fortune of my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were not ſo true, as what thou haſt told me concerning the Lady I loue. For things ordeined and appoynted by the higheſt, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Vngan,</hi> none knoweth how to gaine-ſay or remedy, and therefore men of wiſdome ſhould neuer be ſad or reioyce at them, becauſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the Lord diſpoſeth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters beyond the capacity of men &amp; farre otherwiſe then they expect. For this cauſe my Lord, forgetting all that I haue ſaid, and which you haue bin ſo curious to vnderſtand: referre all things to God, deſiring him in theſe your affaires and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to limit the end of them to his honor and glory, and thus (in mine opinion) you ought to ſet downe your reſt. The King was highly contented with <hi>Vngan,</hi> and ſo eſteemed of him, that from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce forward he had him neere his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by meanes whereof he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many great fauours. Now it happened, that at that inſtant as the king parted from the Philoſophers, a Damoſell preſented her ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, right coſtly in garments and faire in beauty, thus ſpeaking. <hi>Vnderſtand King</hi> Perion, <hi>that when thou recouereſt thy loſſe, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Ireland ſhall looſe her flower.</hi> So giuing her Palfrey the bridle, and the King not able to ſtay her, ſhe rode away: theſe wordes made the good Prince more ſad &amp; pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue then he was before.</p>

Ah <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales,</hi> if many great perſonages were aduertiſed of what I know certainly, I aſſure thee they would cauſe thee to looſe thy head. Wherefore? quoth he. Becauſe, ſaid the Damoſell, thou nouriſheſt their death in thy houſe. The knight knew not the woman that thus talked with him, but you muſt vnderſtand, how ſhe was the ſame that ſaid to king Perion, <hi>that when he recouered his loſſe, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Ireland ſhould loſe her flower,</hi> yet notwithſtanding he was farre from the matter, becauſe he knew not whereof ſhe ſpake, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus replyed. For Gods ſake (Damoſell) I pray ye tell me, on what occaſion you vſe theſe ſpeeches. Beleeue me <hi>Gandales,</hi> qooth ſhe, I haue tolde thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth. At theſe wordes ſhe departed from him, leauing him very ſad and penſiue: yet long he did not continue in theſe thoughts, but he ſaw her returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in great haſt, thus crying &amp; calling. Ah <hi>Gandales,</hi> for Gods ſake ſuccor me: then <hi>Gandales</hi> turning about, beheld a knight follow her with his Sword drawne, wherefore he gaue his horſe the ſpurres to meete him, and placed himſelfe for the defence of the Damoſell,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7179:11"/>
then comming to him that purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, he ſaid. Stay thou bad ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed knight, what moueth thee thus trecherouſly to outrage Ladyes? What now? anſwered the other, doeſt thou hope to ſaue her, who by trumpery hath made me looſe both body and ſoule? That meddle not I withall, ſaid <hi>Gandales,</hi> but I will defend her to my power, well knowing that Ladyes ought not to be corrected in this manner, albeit they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it. We ſhal preſently ſee that, anſwered the knight: and ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopped to the place from whence he came, which was a little thicket of trees, where ſtayed a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyfull Lady, who when ſhe ſaw him returne, came forth, bringing him a Sheeld and a ſtrong Launce, which he tooke, and without lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger tariance, returned to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>Gandales</hi> being a ſterne knight, would not refuſe him: whereupon they met together in ſuch ſorte, as their launces were broken no their Sheelds, and they with their horſes caſt to the ground, yet quickly did they recouer footing, when began betweene them a meruailous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, which worſe would haue bin, but that ſhe which deſired ſuccor of <hi>Gandales,</hi> ſtepped betweene them, ſaying.

Moſt willingly, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Knight, then throwing his Sword and Sheeld down, came and humbled himſelfe on both his knees before her, whereat <hi>Gandales</hi> was greatly amazed, afterward the Damoſell ſaid to the Knight. Goe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand the Lady vnder the trees, that ſhe get her away immediatly, vnleſſe thou ſhalt take her head from her ſhoulders. To this charge the Knight yeelded himſelfe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and to her whom he loued more then himſelfe (by ſudden change from loue to hatred) he came and angerly ſaid. Trayterous woman, I know not how I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my ſelfe from killing thee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. Well perceiued the poore Lady, that her friend was enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that conteſtation would nothing at all profit her: wherefore incontinent ſhe mounted on her palfray, and rode away, making the moſt grieuous ſorrow that euer was heard, and there remained ſhe whom <hi>Gandales</hi> had defended, ſpeaking to him in this manner. You haue (Sir) done ſo much for me, as I ſhall be beholding to you while I liue, and now you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part at your pleaſure: for if the knight offended me, I haue pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with all my heart. As touching your pardon, anſwered <hi>Gandales,</hi> I haue nothing to doe therewith: for my ſelfe, I will end the Combate, or he ſhall hold him-ſelfe vanquiſhed. It behoueth that you acquite him, ſaid the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, ſeeing that if you were the beſt Knight in the world, eaſily can I make him ouercome yee. Do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in what you can, replyed <hi>Gandales,</hi> but I will not acquite him, except you firſt declare to me, wherefore (euen now) you ſaid, that I kept the death of many people in my houſe. Then will I rather tell ye, quoth ſhe, becauſe I loue you both: He as mine owne Soule, &amp; you as my defender, albeit conſtraint can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make me doe it: ſo taking him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſide, ſhe ſaid. You ſhall ſweare to me as a loyall Knight, that no other ſhall know it by you, vntill ſuch time as I command it: hereof he made her faithfull promiſe. Know then, ſaid the Damoſell, that he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7179:11"/>
whom you found in the Sea, ſhall one day be the flower of chiualdry, and ſhall cauſe the very ſtrongeſt to ſtoope, he ſhall enterpriſe, and with honor finiſh what other ſhall faile off: and ſuch deedes of armes ſhall he doe, as no one thinkes can be begun or ended by the ſtrength of one man. The proud ſhall he make humble and gracious, being cruell and pittileſſe, as alſo benigne and amiable to the debonaire: this Knight moſt loyally will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine loue, and ſhall effect in place anſwerable to his magnanimitie. Moreouer, I aſſure thee <hi>Gandales,</hi> that he is the Sonne of a King, and (without doubt) all this will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen which I haue told thee: but if thou keepe it not ſecret, it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thee more harme then good. Madame, anſwered <hi>Gandales,</hi> I pray ye tell me where I may meete with you hereafter, to conferne with you on the affaires of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant. That muſt you not know by me, ſaid the Damoſell, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yet tell me your name, quoth <hi>Gandales,</hi> if ſo it be your pleaſure. By the faith you beare to the thing you moſt loue in the world, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed ſhe you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iure me ſo, as you ſhall know it: albeit the thing that moſt I loue, is he that wiſheth me leaſt good, and would you know what he is? it is the Knight againſt whom ere while you combated: notwithſtanding, I will not leaue to intreat him at my pleaſure, with-out he being able to remedy him-ſelfe. My name is <hi>Vrganda the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne:</hi> and to the end you may remember me an other time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde me well at this preſent. At that inſtant, ſhe who ſhewed her ſelfe to <hi>Gandales</hi> faire, yong and freſh, as one of eighteene yeeres, became ſo olde and ouer ſpent, as he meruailed how ſhe could ſit on her horſe, if then he was ſtricken into admiration, you may iudge. But when ſhe had beene a prittie while in that ſtate, ſhe tooke out of a little bottell (which ſhe cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) a certaine vnguent, wherewith ſhe rubbed her face, &amp; right ſoone recouered her former counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, ſaying to <hi>Gandales.</hi> What iudge ye now Sir? thinke you to finde me hereafter againſt my will, vſing all the dilligence you can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe? neuer therefore put your ſelfe to ſuch paine: for when all liuing creatures goe about it, if I liſt, they ſhall looſe their labour. In good faith Madame, anſwered <hi>Gandales,</hi> I now make no doubt thereof, yet I beſeech ye to be mindefull of the Gentleman, who is forſaken of all but my ſelfe. Doe not you trouble your ſelfe there-with, ſaid <hi>Vrganda,</hi> this forſaking wil be a recouering of much more. My loue to him in greaterthen you can imagine, being ſhe that ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intendes to receiue by him two aydes, which no other can giue me. In recompence whereof, I will giue him two likewiſe, wherewith he ſhall thinke himſelfe highly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied. Let this ſuffiſe ye for this time, becauſe of neceſſitie I muſt be gone: aduiſing ye, that you ſhal ſee me againe ſooner then you thinke for. At theſe wordes the Damoſell departed, and <hi>Gandales,</hi> who had not all this while regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Knight againſt whom he fought, ſeeing him now bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, reputed him one of the goodlyeſt Gentlemen that euer he had ſeene: who after he had taken vp his Sheeld, and laced on his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, followed the Damoſel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for this time we will let them goe, continuing what happened to <hi>Gandales.</hi>

                     <hi>Vrganda</hi> being departed, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7179:12"/>
toward his Caſtel, meeting by the way with the Lady, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi> had cauſed to be chaſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her friend, and this ſorrowfull wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was heard by a Fountaine, where ſhe wept &amp; lamented very bitterly: when ſhe eſpyed him that came toward her, ſhe eaſily knew him, wherefore ſhe thus ſpake. Is it poſſible, Sir Knight, that the wicked creature whom you ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured, hath done ſo much as to let you liue? wicked ſhe is not, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Gandales,</hi> but wiſe and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: and if you be otherwiſe, I will make you deny theſe fooliſh wordes. Ah God, ſaid the Lady: how can the villaine deceiue euery one? How hath ſhe deceiued you; replied <hi>Gandales.</hi> Alas, quoth the Lady, ſhe hath taken from me the faire Knight that ſhould be mine: and ſo may I well ſay, ſeeing he would be more content to be with me, then with her. This is meere folly, anſwered <hi>Gandales,</hi> for in mine opinion, both you &amp; ſhe doe loue without reaſon. How euer it be, ſaid the Lady, if I can I will be auenged. You trauile in vaine, quoth he, thinking to iniurie her that knowes it, not onely before you execute it, but when you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it. In ſooth anſwered the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, this afternoone ye may be gone when you pleaſe: and neuertheles it often happeneth, that thoſe which thinke they know moſt by preſumption, fall into the greateſt dangers. <hi>Gandales</hi> ſeeing her ſo impatient, commending her to God, followed his way, thinking more of the yong Gentlemans af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, then what the Lady had ſpoken to him. Being come to his Caſtell, and ſeeing the little boy come running towards him, he tooke him vp in his armes, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly embracing him, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred what <hi>Vrganda</hi> had ſaide to him, which made the teares ſtand in his eyes with ioy, ſaying within himſelfe. Faire Childe, I pray God I may liue ſo long, as to ſee thee ſuch a one as I hope for. At this time the yong Prince was about three yeeres olde, who ſeeing his Lord weepe, (as one moued with compaſſion) he wiped his eyes, which made <hi>Gandales</hi> imagine great humanity in him: and that as the childe grew in age &amp; ſtrength, ſo waxed he in will, the better to helpe him if he had occaſion. Wherefore thence forward, he was very carefull of him, deuiſing all meanes for his beſt education, and compayning continually with his play fellowe <hi>Gandalin,</hi> he took very great delight in ſhooting.</p>
                  <p>He being come to the age of ſixe yeeres, King <hi>Languines</hi> and his Queene riding through the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, came to <hi>Gandales</hi> Caſtell, where they were royally feaſted: But before they there ariued, <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi> being aduertiſed of their comming, cauſed the yong Prince and his companions to be hid in a backe Chamber, fearing that in reſpect of his beauty and good grace, the King would be deſirous to take him away with him, or elſe that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the houſe. But it fortuned, that the Queene being lodged in one of the higheſt roomes in the Caſtell, as ſhe looked forth at a windowe, which was on that ſide where the Children were, ſhe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the yong Prince and his play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes drawing their bowes, and marking him very well, ſhe liked him aboue all the other, taking great pleaſure to behold his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, thinking he was Sonne to the Lord of the houſe: yet being doubtfull, and not ſeeing any of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7179:12"/>
whom ſhe might aske the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhe thus called to her Ladyes. Come and behold the faireſt yong creature that euer was ſeene. At theſe words they al came running, and ſoone after, the Childe being drye, left his bowe by his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, going to drinke at a conduit pipe, which was hard by: in meane while, one of them that was bigger then the Prince, tooke vp his bow to draw it, but <hi>Gandalin</hi> would not ſuffer him, whereupon a great ſtrife fell betweene them, and <hi>Gandalin</hi> being the weakeſt, cryed out: <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the ſea,</hi> come helpe me. When the Prince heard him, he left his draught, and ran to him that miſuſed his brother, taking his bowe from him, giuing him there-with a great ſtroke ouer the head, ſaying: In an euill hower (varlet) doſt thou outrage my brother. The other not content therewith, came to the Prince, &amp; they fought together: yet he that began the noyſe was glad to run thence, and by the way met their Gouernour, who ſaid: Whether runneſt thou; Maiſter, quoth he, the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea</hi> will beate me: then the Gouernour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the Prince, rigorouſly threatned him, ſaying. What; are you already ſo bolde to beate your companions; you ſhall be talked withall by and by for it. When the Prince heard his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he fell downe on his knees, ſaying. If you will appoynt that I ſhall be beaten, more gladly will I take it, then ſuffer my brother to be wronged in my preſence. With theſe words the teares trickled downe his cheekes, which moued pity in the Gouernour, wherefore he thus anſwered. If euer you doe ſo againe I will make ye weepe in an other ſorte. The Queene who had heard and ſeene all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, was greatly abaſhed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they called the little boy, the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea.</hi>

It chanced during theſe ſpeeches, that the King caſt his eye on the little Prince, to whom he ſeemed no leſſe beautyfull then he did to the Queene, wherefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Gandales</hi> to fetch him: for when I goe hence (quoth he) I will take him with me, and haue him brought vp with mine one Son. In ſooth my Lord, anſwered <hi>Gandales,</hi> he is yet to yong to leaue his Mother: but hauing brought him, preſented him to the King,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7179:13"/>
who ſaid. Faire Child will ye go with me to the Court; My Lord, anſwered the Childe, I will goe whether you pleaſe, if my brother ſhall goe with me. And I quoth <hi>Gandalin,</hi> will not tarry here with-out him. I perceiue my Lord, ſaid <hi>Gandales,</hi> that if you take the one, you muſt needes haue the other, for they will not be ſeperated. I am the better pleaſed, anſwered the King: then calling <hi>Agraies</hi> to him, ſaid. My Son, I will that you loue theſe two Gentlemen, as I do their Father. When <hi>Gandales</hi> ſaw, that the King would haue them away in good earneſt, with the teares in his eyes, he thus ſpake in his hart. My childe, that ſo ſoone beginneſt to proue fortunate, now I ſee thee in the ſeruice of them, who one day may (happily) ſerue thee, if it pleaſe God to guide and protect thee, as I ſhall humbly pray for, &amp; ſuffer that the words of <hi>Vrganda the vnknowne</hi> ſpoken to me, may proue true: making me ſo happy, as to liue to ſee the time, of thoſe great meruailes, promiſed thee in Armes. The King who noted <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales,</hi> ſeeing that his eyes were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with teares, came to comfort him, ſaying. Beleeue me, I neuer thought you had bene ſuch a foole, as to weepe for a Childe. Ah my Lord anſwered <hi>Gandales,</hi> it may be vpon greater occaſion then you thinke for, and if it pleaſe you to know the truth, I will preſently tell ye heere before your Queene. So he tolde the whole diſcourſe, how he found the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> and in what equipage: and he had proceeded with that which <hi>Vrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> foretold him, but that he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the oath he tooke. Now my Lord ſaid <hi>Gandales,</hi> deale for him as you ſhall pleaſe, for (ſo God helpe me) according to his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I thinke him to be iſſued of great linage. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King heard this, he eſteemed much the better of him, that he had ſo carefully nouriſhed the child he found, and thus anſwered. It is great reaſon (ſeeing god hath done ſo much for him, as to preſerue him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo great a danger) that now we be diligent inhis education, and endowe him with habilities when time ſhall ſerue. In good faith my Lord, ſaid the Queene, ſo pleaſe you, he ſhalbe mine during his young yeeres, and when he comes to mans eſtate, I will deliuer him to ſerue you. Well Madame, quoth the King, I giue him you. Now early on the next morning, the King would ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, wherefore the Queene, not hauing forgot the gift of her Lord, tooke with her <hi>Gandalin</hi> and the young <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> whom ſhe commanded to be ſo carefully attended as her owne Sonne, for ſhe tooke ſuch pleaſure in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, that dayly ſhe would haue him neere her owne perſon, becauſe he had ſuch a cheerefull ſpirit, and ſo well gouerned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as he was well liked of euery one, ſo that whatſoeuer he did, paſſed with generall allowance, &amp; no other paſtime had he, but in ſhooting and cheriſhing dogges for the chaſe.</p>
                  <p>Now doth the Authour leaue this matter, returning to that which happened to King <hi>Perion,</hi> &amp; his new freind <hi>Eliſena.</hi> King <hi>Perion</hi> (as you haue already heard) being in <hi>Gaule,</hi> where he vnderſtood by his Philoſphers the expoſition of his dreame, as alſo what the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell had told him: <hi>That when he recouered his loſſe, the Kingdome of Ireland ſhould looſe her flower:</hi> he became more penſiue then before, yet could he vnderſtand nothing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7179:13"/>
thereof. As he thus ſadly ſpent his dayes, it chanced that another Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell entred his Pallace, who brought him a letter from <hi>Eliſena,</hi> whereby ſhe gaue him to know, that King <hi>Garinter</hi> her Father was dead, and ſhe remained alone, and for this cauſe he ſhould pitty her, in that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> would take her Kingdome from her. For the death of King <hi>Garinter</hi> was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> ſomewhat ſorrowfull, but yet he comforted himſelfe, by thinking he ſhould goe to ſee his friend, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom he had not dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed one iot of his affection, wherefore he quickly diſpatched the Damoſell, ſaying to her. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and ſay to your Miſtreſſe, that without ſtaying one whole day, I ſhall be in ſhort time with her. The Damoſell well pleaſed with this anſwere, returned, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the King had ſet his affaires in order, he parted in good equipage to ſee his <hi>Eliſena,</hi> and iournied ſo ſpeedily, as he ariued in little <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:</hi> where he heard newes that king <hi>Languines</hi> had already gotten all the cheefe of the Country, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe Cities which <hi>Garinter</hi> gaue to <hi>Eliſena,</hi> who now abode (as he vnderſtood) at a place na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Arcate,</hi> whether he addreſſed himſelfe. If he were there well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, I leaue to your iudgments, and ſhe likewiſe of him whom ſhe loued ſo much. After the welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming &amp; feaſting of one another, the King told her that he would now marry her, and for that cauſe ſhe aduertiſed her kindred and Subiects: which ſhe did with all diligence could be deuiſed, as alſo with ſo great contentation as her heart might deſire, for herein on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſted the ſumme of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Which being heard by the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this, King <hi>Perion</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready arriued with his Siſter: he ſent immediatly for all the noble men of his Realme, to beare him company in doing honor and wel-come to the King his brother. At his comming, he was gratiouſly receiued by King <hi>Perion,</hi> and after by embracings they had ſaluted each other, and the nuptials like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thorowly ended: the kings derermined to returne home into their owne Countryes.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Perion</hi> trauailing toward <hi>Gaule</hi> with his Queene <hi>Eliſena,</hi> &amp; ſomewhat weary with tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the way, he would refreſh himſelfe along by a Riuer ſide: &amp; while the tentes were erecting, he rode ſoftly alone by the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bancke, imagining how he might know the truth, whether <hi>Eliſena</hi> had a child, according as his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophertold him in expounding his dreame. But ſo long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he in this thought, that riding on without any regarde, he came to an Hermitage which was neere at hand: wherefore finding him-ſelfe at a place of deuotion, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, tying his Horſe to a tree, that he might goe in to ſay his prayers. And entring the Church, he found there a very antient reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, who comming to meete him, ſaid, Knight, is it true, that king <hi>Perion</hi> is marryed to our kings daughter? yea verily, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the king, Praiſed be God, ſaid the good Hermit, for I know certainly, that ſhe loueth him with all her hart. How can you tell that; replied the king. Euen from her owne mouth, ſaid the good olde man. The king then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping he ſhoud heare of him the thing which he moſt deſired to know, ſaid. I pray ye Father tell me, what you haue vnderſtood of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7179:14"/>
her and me, for I am King <hi>Perion.</hi> Truely Sir, anſwered the wiſe man, herein ſhall I greatly fault, and iuſtly might ſhe repute me an heretique, if I ſhould manifeſt what ſhe hath told me vnder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: ſuffiſe your ſelfe with that I haue declared, namely, the true and ſincere loue ſhe beareth you. But ſeeing I haue met ye in a place ſo conuenient, I will that ye know, what a Damoſell (in mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very wiſe) ſaid to me at the time you came firſt into this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: yet ſpake ſhe to me ſo darkely, as I neuer knew well how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend her words, for ſhe ſaid. <hi>That from little</hi> Brittaine <hi>ſhould come two great Dragons, that ſhould hold their gouernment in</hi> Gaule, <hi>and their hearts in great</hi> Brittaine, <hi>and from thence they ſhould go to deuoure the beaſtes of other Countryes: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome they ſhould be braue and cruell, and againſt other ſome hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and gracious, as though they had neither nayles or hart.</hi> At theſe words I became very penſiue, nor could I euer ſince learne the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification hereof. Nor did the King at this inſtant vnderſtand them, but was in no leſſe meruaile then the Hermite: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, no long time after he found this propheſie to be true. Now the king hauing commended the holy man to God, returned to his tents, where he ſaluted his Queene, yet would he not tell her (as then) any thing of that wherewith his mind was troubled: but diſſembled the ſame till they were in bed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their accuſtomed embracings, the king by an apt meane recou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to her, what his Aſtrologers had ſaid on his dreame, earneſtly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her to tel him, whether ſhe had any Child by him or no. When the good Lady heard this, ſhe was ſurpriſed with ſhame in ſuch ſorte, as willingly ſhe could haue wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed her ſelfe dead: and therefore altogether denied the truth, ſo that at this time the king might not know what he deſired. On the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row they departed thence and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued in <hi>Gaule,</hi> where this noble Queen was generally receiued with great ioy. And becauſe that (as it hath bene heretofore rehearſed) the king bare herſinguler affection, he did for her ſake ſtay more in his Realme, then he was wont to doe: ſo that not long after, the Queene brought him a Sonne, who was named <hi>Galaor,</hi> and next a daughter called <hi>Melicia.</hi>

All this while the king laboured to perſwade her, whereby at laſt ſhe reobtained the reaſon that before was abſent, whereupon the king ſaid. Madame, we muſt thank God for all, and cheefely in this caſe, for now I euidently ſee hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, the effect of my dreame, whereof ſometime I tolde ye: thus is little <hi>Galaor</hi> the laſt hart, that muſt be taken from vs againſt our will. Henceforth therefore feare not to declare, what is become of the firſt, for conſidering the eſtate you then were in, you ought not in reaſon to be blamed. At theſe words the mournefull mother for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting none of the fault commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, told him the miſ-fortune of her firſt borne Sonne, entreating him to pardon her, ſeeing ſhe did it throw feare of death, according as was the law of the Country. In good faith Madame, anſwered the king, well may ye aſſure your ſelfe, that while I liue I will not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ye on your behalfe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray ye, take their deſteny ſo ſecretly as you may: for I truſt in God, that ſeeing it hath pleaſed him at our beginning, to afforde vs ſo little ioy and comforte by our children, in time to come he will recompence vs with better ſucceſſe, and it may be yet one day, that we ſhall heare good tidings of them.</p>
                  <p>Now leauing this, ye muſt note, that the Giant who bare away the young Prince, was of the Country of <hi>Leonois,</hi> Lord of an Iſle named <hi>Gandalan,</hi> wherein he had two ſtrong places. He was not a bloudy man, as many other were, but of a gentle and peaceable conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; except when he was offended, for in his fury he would doe great cruelties. At one inſtant was the little barque ſo caried by the wind, as he arriued in his country, which he had cauſed to be peopled with Chriſtians, &amp; there he kept a Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite of moſt holy life, to whom he went ſaying. Father take this child, and nouriſh him for me, teaching him all that is conuenient in a knight, for I aſſure ye, he is the ſon of a king and a Queene. Ah, ſaid the Hermet, why haue you doone ſuch a cruell deede? I will tell ye, anſwered the Giant. Being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to go combate with the Giant <hi>Albadan,</hi> who moſt vnhappily killed my father, as you know, and at this preſent forcibly holds from me the Rocke of <hi>Galteres,</hi> which by right appertaineth to me: being thus embatqued to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ccute mine intent, there came a Damoſell to me, who ſaid. Thou

abuſeſt thy ſelfe, for what thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt about, muſt be done by the ſon to king <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaul,</hi> who is much more ſtrong and hardy then thou art. I demanded by her faith, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe told me true or no. That ſhlat thou ſee, quoth ſhe: <hi>At what time the two branches of one tree ſhall be ioyned, which at this inſtant are ſeuered:</hi> then did ſhe tell me, where I ſhould find him of whome ſhe ſpake, and this is he I giue you in guard, euen as you loue me. By theſe meanes remained little <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> in the holy mans charge, and there he ſtaied ſo long, till he was of yeeres to receiue the order of Knight-hood, as hereafter ſhalbe recited to you.</p>
                  <p>At this time reigned in great <hi>Brittaine</hi> a king named <hi>Falangris,</hi> who dying without children, left one of his bretheren his heire: no leſſe prudent in all affaires, then prompt at armes, and Knightly chiualry, being called <hi>Liſuart,</hi> who maried (not long before) with <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſana,</hi> daughter to the king of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> the faireſt Lady that then was to be found in all the North parts.</p>

                  <p>In this place the author leaueth the new King peaceably ruling in great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and returneth to the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> who by this time hath attained the age of twelue yeeres: albeit in ſtature he ſeemed paſt fifteene, and for his good grace (both of the Queene and the other Ladies) was loued and eſteemed more then any other. Now according as hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared, the yong Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> daughter to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> was left with the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> to refreſh her ſelfe, till the King her father ſhould ſend for her, and to her did the Queene vſe all the gracious curteſies could be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſaying to her withall: Faire Madame, henceforth (ſo pleaſe you) ſhall the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea</hi> ſerue you, and be yours. Which the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, wherefore the yong Prince made ſuch an impreſſion of this kindnſſe in his ſpirite, as during life he ment to ſerue nor loue any other; and therefore for euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to her his heart: but ſo well it came to paſſe, that this loue was mutuall and equall betweene them both. Notwithſtanding, the Prince for a while hauing no knowledge thereof, thought him-ſelfe vnworthy ſo great good: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting it a very bold enterpriſe to thinke thereon, which was the cauſe he durſt not ſpeake, but ſhew his good will in outward ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance. The yong Princeſſe who was of the ſame minde, and alſo in like paine, forbare to talke more with him then any other, thereby to auoyde all ſuſpition: but the eyes of the two louers doing their deuoire and office, entercourſed the thing which moſt they eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and thus couertly they liued, without acquainting each other with this amorous affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Soone after, this yong vnknowne Prince, ſeeing that to attaine the good grace of the Lady he loued, it was neceſſary he ſhould take Armes, &amp; receiue the order of Knighthood, he ſaid to himſelfe. If once I were a Knight, I would do ſuch exployts, as ſhould deſerue the fauour of my Lady, or die in the attempt. And in this deſire, one day finding king <hi>Languines</hi> at leyſure for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and comming to him in the garden where he walked, he fell on his knee, vſing theſe ſpeeches. My Lord, might it ſtand with your pleaſure, I gladly would receiue my Knight-hood. When the King heard him, ſeeing his yong yeeres, he was greatly abaſhed, and thus anſwered.

For if through feare or cowardiſe he forſake what he ought to doe, more better is death to him, then a ſhamefull life: therefore by mine aduiſe, I would haue you yet a while to forbeare. The Prince not

contented with this anſwere, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I will not forgoe honor, my Lord, through any ſuch feare as it pleaſeth you to alleadge, for if I had not the deſire to doe all that appertaineth to Chiualrie, I would not haue beene ſo bold to make this requeſt: but ſeeing by your gracious fauour I haue beene hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto nouriſhed, moſt humbly I beſeech ye to grant me this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I may receiue no occaſion of looſing your ſeruice, to ſeeke elſe where for obtaining my ſuite. The king highly eſteemed the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the youth, and doubting leaſt he would depart indeed, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Aſſure your ſelfe Gentle-man, that I wil do it whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſee it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ye, in meane while pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide your Armes and what elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth: Yet tell me (faire Sir) to whome (if I refuſed) would you go for your order. To King <hi>Perion,</hi> ſaid the Prince, who is reputed a good and hardie Knight, for he hath maried the Siſter to your Queene, who maketh me beleeue that he will not denie me: when I ſhall let him vnderſtand, how ſhee hath nouriſhed me, and that I am her ſeruant. It is true, quoth the King, but for this preſent haue a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle patience, and when time ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, you ſhalbe honorably knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: in meane while he gaue charg, that all his needfull accoutrements for the cauſe ſhould be prouided.</p>
                  <p>Now did the king aduertiſe <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi> heereof, who was ſo conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith, as he ſoone diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a Damoſell toward the yong Prince: by whome he ſent the Sword, the Ring, and the letter co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with waxe, which he found in the cheſt he tooke out of the ſea. Such ſpeede made the Damoſell, as ſhe came to the Prince, at what time he was ſporting with <hi>Oriana</hi> and the other Ladies, while the Queene ſlept. At that inſtant was he in ſuch a ſollemne thought of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> as not daring to lift vp his eyes to behold her, ſaid within himſelfe. Ah God, why haſt thou endued this Lady with ſuch exel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beauty, that vnhappy I ſhould ſuffer ſo extreame paſſions by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her? Ah mine eyes, too high did ye looke when ye beheld her, of whome you are not worthy: but if the worſt happen, death ſhall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie this timeritie, whereto my hart (for her) is humbled. In this thought he was like to fall downe, ſo had he forgotten and ouergone himſelfe: when a page came to him, ſaying. Gentleman, there is a ſtrange Damoſell attending with-out, who hath brought you cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine preſents, and would ſpeake with ye. When ſhe (who loued him) heard this meſſage, her hart began to tremble in ſuch ſorte, as being not able to endure this new flame, ſhe called to the Prince, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I pray ye ſtay heere, and let the Damoſel come in, that we may haue the ſight of what ſhee hath brought: which he did, &amp; the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell being entred, thus ſpake to him. My Lord, your good friend <hi>Gandales</hi> ſaluteth you, as the man whom he onely loueth, and hath ſentye this Ring, this waxe, &amp; this Sword, which he deſireth ye (for his ſake) to keepe while you liue.

if you pleaſe Madame, quoth he, but me thinkes this faire Ring were better forye. I will haue nothing but this waxe, ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> and ſo tooke it. During theſe diſcourſes, the King came, who ſaid to the Prince: What thinke ye of that Sword? My Lord, quoth he, I find it a very faire one, but I maruaile wherefore it hath no ſcabbard. It is ſaid the King, very neer fifteene yeeres ſince it had one: &amp; hauing ſo ſaid, he laid it aſide, proceeding thus. You would be a Knight, and know not whether you ought to be one or no: therefore it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that you vnderſtand what you are, and I to tell you ſo much as I know. Heereupon he declared, how he was found in a cheſt on the ſea, with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I beleeue my Lord, quoth the Prince, that for your pleaſure you vſe this inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe the Damoſell when ſhe entred ſaid: that my good friend <hi>Gandales</hi> ſent me theſe preſents, but I think ſhe fayled in her words, and would haue ſaid my father <hi>Gandales.</hi> Notwithſtanding (my Lord) if it be ſo as you haue reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I am not diſpleaſed thereat: except in not knowing of whence I am, nor they me, yet do I thinke my ſelfe a Gentleman, for my hart perſwades me of no leſſe. Now therefore it is more neceſſary that I be Knighted then before, to the end I may labour to become ſuch a one as may acquire honor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, ſeeing I haue no parents by whom I may be named, not knowing what I am. When the King heard him ſpeake ſo vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, he eſteemed much better of him then before, thinking him-ſelfe, that he could not but be a man of calling and hardy.</p>
                  <p>As thus they were deuiſing, a Gentleman came to the King, and ſaid. My Lord, King <hi>Perion</hi> your brother is come to the Court. The King very glad thereof, departed to receiue his brother, &amp; embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him, thus ſpake. I ſee my good brother, you meant to take me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided, for little did I thinke of your ſo ſudden arriual in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

And which is worſt of all, Fortune hath ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealt with me, that certaine whome I truſted haue forſaken me, and the greateſt part of my other friends are ouerthrown in the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes we haue had together, ſo that now I come to requeſt your ſuccour in this extreame neede. Truely brother, anſwered <hi>Langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> you may be ſure thereof, and your miſ-fortune grieueth me not a little: but I wil prouide therefore ſo well as I can. <hi>Agraies</hi> who was newly knighted, being hot and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Armes, hauing heard the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of his Vnckle, and the grant the King his father had made him of aſſiſtance: came and fell on his knee before him, ſaying.

                     <hi>Gentleman of the ſea</hi> heard this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, he was more earneſt to compaſſe his enterpriſe then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and ſeeing king <hi>Perion</hi> was preſent, he could not glut his eyes with beholding him, onely for the good reporte he had heard of him: for he thought not then of any affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie or parentage, but would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be Knighted by his hand then any other, in reſpect of his high &amp; hautghy deedes of Armes.

Madame, anſwered he, in what ſort ſoeuer it be, I haue no forces at all, but ſuch as haue left me in great deſire to ſerue you: for my hart is altogether yours, and can receiue nothing but from you. Mine? quoth <hi>Oriana,</hi> and ſince when? Since the time it pleaſed you Madame, replied the Prince. And when was it, quoth ſhe, that it pleaſed me; At that time, anſwered the Prince, when the king your father left you in this Country, if you remember, and when the Queene preſented me to you, ſaying: I giue you this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to ſerue you, and at that time you accepted me as yours, when you anſwered, that you were well contented. Then was I giuen to you, and yours onely I reputed my ſelfe, ſo that I haue no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer my ſelfe. Certes, ſaid <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> you tooke her words to better end, then at that time ſhe meant them: which I take in good part, and am content it ſhall be ſo. No ſooner had ſhe thus ſaid, but the Prince was ouercome with ſuch ioy, as he had no power to anſwer. <hi>Oriana</hi> perceiuing it, made no ſhew thereof, but ſaid ſhe would goe to the queene, to doe what he had deſired: and returned ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, telling him, that her griefe was for the Queene of <hi>Gaule</hi> her ſiſter, becauſe the King of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed her country. So pleaſe you Madame, anſwered the Prince, if I were Knighted, I gladly would go ſuccor her, with your leaue. And without my leaue, quoth <hi>Oriana,</hi> will ye not goe? Not for death, ſaid he, for without your gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, my conquered hart can haue no force or vertue in any perill. At theſe words <hi>Oriana</hi> ſmiled, ſaying. Seeing then you are mine, I grant you to be my Knight, and you ſhall aide the Queenes ſiſter. Moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly did the Prince giue her thanks, telling her, how the King thought it not good to giue him the order of Knighthood, but had denied him: yet, quoth he, is King <hi>Perion</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:7179:17"/>
heere as you know, at whoſe hands (ſo pleaſed you to intreate it) I would more willingly receiue it, then of any other. Nor will I let for that, ſaid ſhe, and the better to compaſſe your deſire: I will cauſe the Princeſſe <hi>Mabila</hi> to beare me company, for whoſe ſake he will the ſooner grant it. So preſently ſhe went to her, and told what ſhe and the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea</hi> had concluded, to attaine his Knight-hood, and how faine he would haue it at King <hi>Perions</hi> hand, for which cauſe ſhe intreated her aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the ſute. <hi>Mabila</hi> who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Prince very well, thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. I aſſure ye (ſiſter) there ſhal be no want in me, for ſo well doth the Gentleman deſerue, as would make one do much more then this for him, wherefore let him be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy this night in the Queens Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: then when time ſhall ſerue, we will go with our women to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, and I will ſend for the King mine Vncle (which ſhall be ſomewhat before the breake of day) that he may come ſee me, and he being come to vs, you and I will moue him in the matter, which I hope he will grant vs, conſidering he is a very gracious and affable Prince. This is very well appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, anſwered <hi>Oriana:</hi> wherefore they ſent for the Prince, and tolde him al the platforme they had laid: who humbly thanking them, wold prouide all things ready for him-ſelfe, and therefore departed. Then went he to finde <hi>Gandalin,</hi> making him acquainted with the whole, ſaying. I pray ye brother, conuay mine armour ſo cloſely as you can into the Queenes Chappell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I hope this night to receiue mine order: and for I muſt right ſoone depart hence, I would know if you haue any will to beare me company. Beleeue me, quoth <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> neuer with my will ſhall I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from ye. Of theſe words was the Prince ſo glad, that the teares ſtood in his eyes with ioy. Well ſaid he, prouide all things ready as I told ye: wherein <hi>Gandalin</hi> failed not, for ere ſupper he tooke ſuch order, as all was done vnſeene of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the Prince got him ſecretly into the Chappell, where he armed himſelfe except the head &amp; hands. So ſtaying there for the Ladies &amp; King <hi>Perion,</hi> he fel on his knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Alter, deſiring God to be his aide: not onely in conquering ſuch as he ſhould deale withall in Armes, but alſo in obtaining her, who cauſed him to endure ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mortal paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The night being come, &amp; the Queen with-drawne, the Princeſſes <hi>Oriana</hi> and <hi>Mabila</hi> with their wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, came to the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel where the <hi>Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſea</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, &amp; <hi>Mabila</hi> hauing ſent for K. <hi>Perion,</hi> he was no ſooner entred but ſhe thus began. My L. ſeeing you haue taken ſo much paines for me as to come hither, I pray you grant Madame <hi>Oriana,</hi> daughter to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> a ſmall requeſt ſhe will make to ye. I would be loath, ſaide the King to deny her, as well for her Fathers honor as her own ſake. <hi>Oriana</hi> aroſe to thanke him, whom whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he beheld ſo faire, he thought all the world could not match her in beauty: thus ſpeaking to her. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, doth it pleaſe you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me any thing? Not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand my Lord, quoth ſhe, but intreat ye to giue my Gentleman the order of knight-hood: this ſaid ſhe, poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him as he kneeled before the Altar. When the king ſaw him, he wondred at his goodly ſtature, and ſaid to him. My friend, would you receiue the order of Knight-hood; Yea my good Lord, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7179:18"/>
the Prince, may it pleaſe you to giue it me. In Gods name be it done, ſaid the King, who giue you grace ſo well to proceede therein, as he hath beſtowed ſeemely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection on you. Then putting on his right ſpur, and dubbing him with his Sword, thus ſpake. Now haue ye the Order appertaining to a Knight, but I would oppertunity had ſerued me, to haue giuen it you with greater honor: notwith-ſtanding, according to mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of you, I hope you will proue ſuch, as your renowne ſhall ſupply what wanteth here in performance. Afterward King <hi>Perion</hi> took leaue of the Ladies, who highly thanked him, &amp; then ſet on his way toward <hi>Gaule,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending the new Knight to the heauenly protection: this was the firſt act, that might beare teſtimony of theſe louers ſweete deſires. If it ſeeme to the Reader, that their purpoſe was not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to affection, but ſimple in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their vehement paſſions: I anſwer, that they ought to excuſe their age, likewiſe it often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that they which thinke themſelues moſt expert in thoſe pleaſing and amorous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, haue beene by this God ſo ſtrongly bound, and liuely attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: as not only he depriued them of ſpeech, but of iudgment alſo, &amp; it is neceſſary for ſuch perſons to vſe greater words, then theſe two who as yet had not learned them. But this new Knight being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly furniſhed, and ready to his iourney by his Ladies conſent: would in thanking the company, take a more ſecret conge of <hi>Oriana.</hi> And ſhe who for his ſudden par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, felt new paſſions in her heart, yet neuertheleſſe diſſembling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: tooke him by the hand, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aſide, thus ſpake. <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> you will be gone then, but firſt I pray ye tell me, whether you be the Sonne of <hi>Gandales</hi> or no: for according to the good opinion I haue of you, I thinke you to be iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued of better place. Then reherſed he all that King <hi>Languines</hi> had told him, wherein ſhe conceiued very great pleaſure: which done, they committed each other to God. So departed the Prince from this company, and right-ſoone found <hi>Gandalin,</hi> who attended for him at the Kings lodging dore, with the reſt of his Armes and his Horſe, whereon he mounted, and left the Citie vnſeene of any, becauſe as yet it was not day, ſo rod they on till they came into a Forreſt.</p>
                  <p>Now is the greateſt part of the day ſpent, before they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh themſelues in any place: but hunger conſtrained them to feede on ſuch viandes as <hi>Gandalin</hi> had brought with him from the Citie. During this time, they heard in the Wood on their right hand the voyce of ſome one, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to them very doleful, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prince rode preſently that way: where he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a knight dead, and hard by him another in little better caſe, for he was ſo wounded, that he had no hope to liue. As for the partie that ſo cried, it was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who lay vpon the knight, preſſing him ſo ſore, as made his hart to faile him: and which was worſt of all, the villanous woman to cauſe his death the ſooner, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly thruſt her hands into his wounds. But when the wounded knight eſpied the Prince, ſo well as he could he craued ſuccor, ſaying. Ah gentle Sir, for Gods ſake ſuffer me not to be thus murthered by this ribaud. Greatly was the Prince abaſhed at this wicked dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and therefore very roughly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7179:18"/>
thus ſpake. Woman withdraw your ſelfe, for you doe the thing not beſeeming you or your like. She as one aſhamed, retired, and the Knight full of anguiſh fell in a ſwoune, which made the Prince very deſirous to know what he was: but fearing that he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy yeelded his breath, quickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, &amp; vſed ſuch good meanes as reuiued him againe, when he began to cry. Ah I am dead, good friends bring me to ſome place where I may haue councell for my ſoule. Take courage, anſwered the Prince, for you ſhal haue what you demand: but I pray ye tell me, what fortune brought ye hither, or where is he that hath thus hardly intreated ye? It is, ſaid the Knight, through this wicked woman, who (albeit I was rich and puiſſant, yea far much more then ſhe) I made choiſe, for the good loue I bare her, and eſpouſed her as my wife: neuertheleſſe ſhe diſcourtebus creature, forgetting the good and honor I had done her, hath ſundry times abandoned her honeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, namely this night paſt with this Knight here dead, whom I hauing neuer before ſeene, by chance yeſterday he came to me: and this laſt night thus villanouſly abuſed me, where taking him with the head, we had a combate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherein (as you ſee) he loſt his life. But when this ſtrumpet ſaw I had ſlaine him, fearing I would do as much to her: ſhe fell at my feete and deſired pardon, whereto I eaſily condiſcended, prouided, that ſhe offended no more. Hereupon, I intreated her to bind vp my wounds, but ſhe perceiuing how grieuouſly I was hurt, and brought into very weake eſtate through ouer-much loſſe of my bloud, to reuenge the adulterous villaines death, ſhe aſſaied to kill me outright: and to make me lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the more in dying, cruelly ſhe thruſt her hands into my wounds, ſo that well I perceiue I cannot long liue. Therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech ye good Sir, helpe me to an Hermitage which is neere at hand, where I ſhall find ſome religious man, to comfort me in the agonie of my Soule. Such compaſſion tooke the Prince on him, as he and <hi>Gandalin</hi> taking him in their armes, caried him on a Horſe to the Hermitage: in meane while the wretched woman ſtole away priuily, and a little before, ſhe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that her Husband would be reuenged on her, ſent for helpe to three of her bretheren, who dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not far from that place, giuing them to vnderſtand which way they ſhould come. In her wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring they met with her, and ſhe had no ſooner eſpied them, but ſhe thus cried out. Ah helpe me good bretheren, for heere before is a theeſe, who hath ſlaine this Knight which lieth heere, and hath beſide ſo wounded my Husband: as there is no hope of life left in him: let him not therefore eſcape ye, not he that is in his company, becauſe the one is as deepe in the euill as the other. Such like ſpeeches vſed this Harlot, that by the death of the Prince and <hi>Gandalin,</hi> her treaſon might be couered: therefore that her Husband ſhould not dy alone with her will, ſhe ſhewed them the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> euen as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the Hermitage where he left the wounded Knight. Here-upon the three bretheren (too light of beleefe) galloped toward him, crying. Traitour thou art but dead. You lye villaines, anſwered the Prince, for right well ſhall I defend my ſelfe from ſuch traitours as you
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7179:19"/>
are. Beſtirre thy ſelfe then, ſaid the bretheren, for thou haſt offended vs all three, and we all wil be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on thee if we may. By good hap the Prince had his Sheeld and Launce ready, and his Helmet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well laced, wherefore without any further anſwere, he ſharply charged them, and meeting with the firſt, pearced through both his Sheeld and arme: and withall threw his Horſe &amp; him ſo fiercely againſt the ground, as his right ſhoulder was broken in the fall: in like manner was one of the Horſes legges, ſo that neither the one or other could riſe. At this encounter he brake his Launce, wherefore he ſuddenly drew his Sword, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelfe to the other twaine, gaue one of them ſuch a forcible ſtroke, as ſlicing through his Armour, entred the fleſh to the very bone on his ſhoulder like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſo that therewith he fell from his ſaddle. Being thus diſpatched of two, he came to the third, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him with ſuch a ſound blow on the Helmet, as the poore Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was conſtrained to imbrace the necke of his Horſe, thereby to ſheeld himſelfe from falling, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe as greatly amazed as the other were. Here-upon the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that brought them thether fled away, which the Prince percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing cried to <hi>Gandalin</hi> that he ſhould ſtay her: in meane while the firſt Knight hauing recouered himſelfe, vſed theſe ſpeeches to the Prince. We know not Sir, whether this fight hath beene for right or wrong, For right it could not be, anſwered the Prince, vnleſſe you thinke I haue done wrong, in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring the husband to this trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous woman, whom cruelly ſhe hath cauſed to dy. When the three Knights heard that, they were very much abaſhed, and then thought they had bene abuſed by their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, wherefore they thus replied. In ſooth my Lord, ſo pleaſe you to aſſure vs, we will ſhew on what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion we aſſailed you. You ſhall haue good aſſurance ſo to doe, ſaid the Prince, yet will I not acquit ye from the combate. Then he that firſt ſpake, reherſed all the words of their ſiſter, according as hath beene already declared. In good ſooth quoth the Prince, neuer was villanie diſguiſed in ſuch ſorte, for ſhe hath done far otherwiſe: as you may vnderſtand by her husband himſelfe, who being nere his death, I conuaied to an Hermitage hard at band. Seeing it hath ſo fallen out, ſaid the three bretheren, diſpoſe of vs as they that remain at your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And mercy ſhall ye haue, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Prince, if firſt ye will loyally ſweare to me, that you will cary this woman and her husband, to the Court of King <hi>Languines,</hi> &amp; there before him recite al that hath happened: ſaying withall how you were thereto conſtrained by a yong Knight that ſent ye thether, &amp; who this day departed from his Court, deſiring him to cenſure on this miſ-deed as he ſhall thinke good. All this they promiſed and ſwore to performe: wherefore commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to God, he rode away, leauing them together.</p>

One of them bare a Launce in her hand, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were come to the Prince, ſhe with the Launce aduanced her ſelfe to him ſaying. My Lord, take this Launce which I giue ye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I can aſſure ye, that within three dayes it will ſtand ye in good ſteed, as therewith you ſhall deliuer from death, the houſe from whence ye are diſcended. The Prince amazed at theſe words, thus anſwered. How can it be Lady, that a houſe ſhould liue or dye; It ſhalbe, quoth ſhe, euen ſo as I haue ſaid, and this preſent I was deſirous to bring ye, as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of recompence, for two fauours I hope to receiue by you, the firſt whereof ſhall be: <hi>When one of your beſt friends, ſhall by you haue one of the greateſt honors that euer he can receiue, whereby he ſhall fall into the deepeſt danger, that any Knight hath done theſe ten yeeres ſpace.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me Lady, anſwered the Prince, ſuch honor (if God pleaſe) I will not doe my friend. Full well I know, quoth the Damoſell, that ſo it ſhall come to paſſe: then put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on her Palfray, departed: this Damoſell you muſt note, was <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda the vnknowne.</hi> When the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Damoſell (who heard the words) ſaw her forſake her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſhe determined for certaine daies to ſtay with the Prince, to ſee what he ſhould doe, wherefore ſhe ſaid. My Lord, although I am a ſtranger, if you thinke it conuenei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, I would gladly for a while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with ye, deferring a iourny that I haue to my miſtreſſe. The Prince well perceiued ſhe was a ſtranger, which made him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of whence ſhe was: where-to ſhe replied, that ſhe was of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke.</hi> And that himſelfe could not gain-ſay, becauſe her language gaue aſſurance thereof, for hauing heard his Lady <hi>Oriana</hi> at her firſt comming into <hi>Scotland,</hi> it made him the better remember that Country ſpeech, whereupon he ſaid. If you pleaſe (faire Damoſell) to goe with me, I will defend ye to my power: but I pray ye tell me, if you know the other Lady that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen now gaue me this Launce? Truely Sir, quoth ſhe, neuer did I ſee her, till now I met her on the way, and then ſhe ſaid to me: that the Launce ſhe caried, ſhe would giue to the beſt Knight in the world, deſiring me (withall) to let you vnderſtand after her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that ſhe bare you great affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and how ſhe was named <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda the vnknowne.</hi> Ah God, quoth he, how infortunate am I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> not knowing her, if I forbare now preſently to follow her, you muſt thinke Lady the cauſe is, that I cannot find her againſt her will: and thus deuiſing they rode on,

vntill the dark euening ouer-tooke them.</p>
                  <p>At this time it ſo chanced that they met with a Squire, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded where they intended to find lodging trauailing ſo late. Where we can, anſwered the Prince. In good faith, ſaid the Squire, if you meane to haue lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, you muſt leaue the way which now you take, for you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long time come to any that way: but if you will follow me, I will conduct you to a Caſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to my father, who ſhall do you all the honor and good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment may be deuiſed. The Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſel thinking this councel good, deſired the Prince to accept there-of, which he did, therefore the Squire rode before them as their guide, leading them derectly forth of the way, becauſe he had neuer ſeene the combates of Knights er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand: and hoping to conduct them the day following to a Caſtell where ſuch paſtime was vſed, but that night he brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their lodging, feaſting and entertaining them very ſumptuouſly: yet could the Prince take no reſt all the night, for thinking on the Lady that brought him the Launce. On the morrow very early they would be gone, and taking leaue of their hoſte, the Squire ſaid he would bring them againe into their way, acquainting the Prince as he rode, with the cuſtome of the Caſtell, which being very neere at hand he ſhewed them: the Caſtell ſtanding very ſtrong and pleaſantly, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ran a huge ſwift Riuer, and no paſſage thereto, but ouer a long draw-bridge, hauing at the end a faire. Tower for defence thereof. When the Prince beheld it, he thought he muſt needs paſſe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the bridge, yet he asked the Squire if there were any other way. No my Lord, quoth he, for this is the vſaull paſſage. March on then, ſaid the Prince, wherewith the Squire, the Damoſell and their company ſet forward, but the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the ſea</hi> remaining behind, entred into ſuch a thought of his Lady <hi>Oriana,</hi> as he had well neere forgotten himſelfe: but at length he heard the noyſe of ſixe Halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, armed with Corſlets and Helmets, who at the entrance of the bridge had arreſted the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and there would force her to take an oath, that ſhe ſhould neuer beare loue to hir friend, if he would not promiſe her to aide King <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt King <hi>Perion:</hi> which ſhe refuſing, cried to the Prince for his aſſiſtance.

Traiterous vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines, who commanded you to lay hands on this Lady being in my charge; In ſpeaking theſe words, he came to the chiefeſt of the ſixe, from whom right-ſoone he caught his hatchet, and gaue him ſuch a ſtroke therewith, as he fell to the ground. All the other together pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſet vpon him, but one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſliced to the very teeth, and ſoone after another bare him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, with the loſſe of his arme. When the three that were left ſaw their companions ſo handled, they tooke themſelues to flight, and the Prince followed them ſo neere, as one of them left his legge behinde him, the other twaine he let go, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning where he left the Damoſel. to whom he ſaid. Now boldly go on, and like euill fortune may they haue, that encourage any villany, to lay forſible hand on Lady or Damoſell. She being aſſured by theſe words, went on with the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7179:20"/>
Prince and his Squires: but ere they had gone any thing far, they heard a great noyſe &amp; tumult with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Caſtell. Me thinkes Sir, ſaid the Damoſel, I heare a meruailous murmuring within this Fortreſſe, therefore I would aduiſe ye to take the reſt of your armour. Goe on quoth the Prince, and feare not, for where Ladies are euill entreated (who ought euery where to goe in ſafety) there hardly abideth any man of valew. In ſooth, ſaid ſhe, if you doe not what I haue deſired, I will not paſſe any further: and ſo much ſhee perſwaded him, that at length he laced on his Helmet: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he went into the Caſtell, at the entrance whereof, he met a ſquire weeping, who ſaid. Ah God, why will they murder (without cauſe) the beſt knight in the world? aias they wold inforce him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, what is impoſſible for him to accompliſh. Theſe words of the Squire, could not ſtay the Prince, for he ſaw King <hi>Perion</hi> (who had ſo lately Knighted him) very hardly vſed by two Knights, who with the helpe of ten armed Halberders had round beſet him, ſaying ſweare, if not, thou dieſt. Greatly did it grieue the Prince, to ſee ſuch out-rage offered to King <hi>Perion,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thus called to them. Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous villaines, what moues you to miſuſe the beſt Knight in the world; by heauen you ſhall all die for him. At theſe words, one of the Knights left the King, and taking fiue Halberders with him, came to the Prince, ſaying. It likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth you to ſweare, if not, you can eſcape no better then an other. What? quoth he, ſhal I then ſweare againſt my will; by Gods leaue it ſhall not be ſo. Then they of the Caſtell cryed to the Porter, that he ſhould ſhut the gate, wherefore the Prince now ſaw he muſt ſtand vpon his defence: whereupon hee ran fiercely againſt the Knight, charging him in ſuch ſorte, as he fell downe dead ouer the crupper of his Horſe, for in the fall he brake his necke. Which the Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, not tarring any longer with the Halberders, came to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knight that combated with K. <hi>Perion,</hi> piercing his Launce quite through his body, ſo that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the firſt in fortune. King <hi>Perion</hi> ſeeing himſelfe thus ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured, ſo cheered vp his hart, as he did much better then before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his enemies, cauſing them by ſharpe ſtrokes of his Sword to retire: in meane while the <hi>Gentle-man of the ſea,</hi> (being on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeke) ranne among them and ſcattered them, tumbling one downe heere, and another there, ſo that at length by the aid of the king, they were all ſlaine, except certaine that fled away on the top of the walles. But the Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted and followed them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at they were ſo affrighted, as they caſt themſelues downe headlong fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wals: only two got them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Chamber, where they thought to remaine in ſafetie, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he purſued them ſo neer, as he buckled <hi>pel mel</hi> with them. But within the Chamber on a bed lay an ancient knight, whoſe vnweldy age had taken from him the vſe of his legges, to them that came in he vſed theſe ſpeeches. Cowardly vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom run ye ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; From a knight, anſwered one of them, who hath plaide the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in your Caſtell, for he hath ſlaine your two Nephewes, and all our companions. As thus he ſpake, the Prince caught him by the head, ſaying. Tell me (villaine) where is the Lord of this place, or
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7179:21"/>
elſe thou dieſt. The poore man ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe in ſuch perill, ſhewed him the old knight lying on the bed: but when the Prince ſaw him ſo old and decrepite, he blamed him in this manner. Thou wretched olde man, hath death already ſeazed on thy bones, and yet dooſt thou cauſe ſuch a wicked cuſtome to be maintained heere? Well dooth thine age excuſe thee from bearing Armes, yet ſhall I giue thee thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert belonging to ſuch a villaine. With theſe words he made offer to ſmite off his head: Wherefore the affrighted olde man cried: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as my Lord, for Gods ſake mercy. None at all, quoth the Prince, thou art dead if thou ſweareſt not to me, that while thou liueſt, ſuch like treaſon ſhall be no more maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this place: whereto the olde knight right gladly tooke his oath. Now tell mee, ſaide the Prince, wherefore haſt thou heeretofore kept this cuſtome heere; For the loue of King <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Knight, who is mine Nephew, and becauſe I cannot aid him with my perſon in his warre, I was deſirous to ſuccour him with ſuch Knights errand as paſfed this way. Falſe villaine, anſwered the Prince, what haue Knights er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to do with thy deſire: ſo ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the bed with his foote, threw it downe, and the olde Knight vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: where commending him to all the Diuels, he left him, and comming downe into the Court, tooke a Horſe which was one of the ſlaine Knights, and bringing it to the King, ſaid. Mount your ſelfe my Lord, for it little likes me to ſtay any longer here, where ſuch bad people haue their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The king preſently went to Horſe bake, and ſo they rode toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the Caſtell: but the Prince fearing leaſt the king ſhould know him, would by no meanes take off his Helmet, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they rode along, the king thus ſpake to him. I pray ye Sir knight tell me of whence you are, that haue ſuccoured me when I was ſo neere my death: warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me alſo hereafter fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of this place, &amp; ſhewing your ſelfe a good friend to Ladies and knights errand. As for me, I am the ſame man againſt whom they kept this ſtraight paſſage, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the cruell oath for which you combated. My Lord, anſwered the Prince, I am a knight deſirous to do you any ſeruice. Beleeue me, quoth the king, that haue I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready well perceiued, for hardly ſhould I haue found ſo good a friend to helpe me: yet will I not giue ouer till I know ye. Alas my Lord, ſaid he, that will little profit ye. Notwithſtanding, quoth the King, I pray ye take off your Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met: which he would not do, but put downe his Beuer a little. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king ſaw that his intreatie would not preuaile, he deſired the Damoſell to obtaine ſo much for him: whereto ſhe condiſcended, tooke the Prince by the hand, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I beſeech ye Sir, grant the king what he hath requeſted. He ſeeing her importunate, took off his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, when preſently the king knew him, that it was the ſame man he had knighted at the Ladies mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherefore embracing him, he ſaid. Right glad am I to know ſo deere a friend. My Lord, quoth the Prince, I knew you ſo ſoone as I came to the Caſtell, to be the man that gaue me mine order of knight-hood, wherewith (ſo pleaſe it God) I meane to ſerue you while your warre continueth in <hi>Gaule:</hi> &amp; willingly I would not be knowne
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7179:21"/>
by any one till your troubles be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. You haue already, ſaid the King, done ſo much for me, as I reſt bounden to you while I liue, allowing you to diſpoſe of me and mine: and if (as you ſay) you come into <hi>Gaule,</hi> you ſhall augment with aduauntage the honor due to you, then iuſtly may I tearme the hower happy, that it was my fortune to make ſo good a Knight. Such like words vſed King <hi>Perion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> litle thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king how neere they were allied to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, &amp; thus they rode deuiſing, till at length they came to a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way, when he demanded of the King, which of thoſe waies pleaſed him to take. This on the left hand, anſwered the King, becauſe it gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth directly to my Country, God haue you then in his keeping, ſaid the Prince, for I muſt needes ſide this other way; I pray ye, quoth the King, remember your comming into <hi>Gaule</hi> as you promiſed me, for the hope I haue in you, hath abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged part of my ſorrow, and giueth me aſſurance withall, that by your meanes I ſhall recouer my loſſe. So tooke they leaue of each other, the king toward <hi>Gaule,</hi> and the Prince in company with the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell and <hi>Gandalin:</hi> but becauſe ſhe had now ſeene what ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, namely the proofe of the Launce which <hi>Vrganda</hi> gaue him, ſhe wold trauaile no further out of her way, but turning to the Prince, ſaid. I haue hetherto (my Lord) with right good will kept ye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, becauſe the Lady that gaue ye the Launce, ſaid ſhe brought it to the beſt knight in the world, and ſurely I haue ſeene ſo much, as I ſtand in no doubt of her ſpeeches: wherefore I ſhall now ſhape my courſe to find her I am ſent to, as before I tolde ye. I pray ye Lady, quoth he, tell me what ſhe is. It is, ſaid ſhe, the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> Daughter to king <hi>Liſuart</hi> of great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> When he heard her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med whom he loued ſo deerely, his hart began to tremble in ſuch ſorte, as he had fallen beſide his Horſe, but that <hi>Ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dalin</hi> ſtaied him, yet fetching a great ſigh, ſaid. Ah God, my hart faileth me, the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell thinking ſome ſudden ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was the cauſe thereof, would haue had him vnarmed: but hee tolde her it was needleſſe, for he was oftentimes wont to feele ſuch paſſions. The Squire (who all this while had beene their guide) tooke leaue of the Prince, asking the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell if her way lay toward the Courte of King <hi>Languines:</hi> which ſhe affirming, he ſaid he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her thether, becauſe hee had buſines of ſome importance there. So hauing courteouſly ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted each other, they returned the ſame way they came, &amp; the Prince rode on with <hi>Gandalin</hi> to ſeeke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures.</p>

Heere in he tooke in great pleaſure, as on this occaſion, as alſo by a naturall inſtinct he was deſirous to be Knighted, neuer the leſſe, he knew not whether by right ſuch honor appertained to him, Very earneſtly he queſtioned thereon with the Hermet, but the holy man who knew right well, that ſo ſoone as he receiued the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7179:22"/>
order, he ſhould combate againſt the Giant <hi>Albadan:</hi> his eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with teares, he thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. My ſonne, much better were it for you to labour in the ſafetie of your ſoule, then to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture on the order of Knight-hood, which is to be maintained with wonderous trauaile. Father, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> very hardly ſhall I follow the calling, which I take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my will: but in that whereof my hart hath made choyſe, if God grant me good ſucceſſe, will I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance his ſeruice, for there-out may I not be during life. The good Hermit, who then well perceiued his grounded reſolution, replied. Certes my Sonne, ſeeing you are determined to follow Armes, I can well aſſure ye, that through fault of high linage, you neede not diſpaire of good hap, in reſpect you are ſon to a King and Queene: but keepe that to your ſelfe, and let not the Giant know how I told ye ſo much. When <hi>Galaor</hi> heard this, he was exceedingly contented, ſaying to the Hermit. In ſooth Father, the care I haue had all my life time to be a Knight, hath beene very great: but now I thanke God and you, I am rid thereof, for by that you haue tolde me, I cannot miſſe of it. The Hermit noting his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt affection, doubted leaſt ſoone after he would be gone: wherefore he gaue the Giant to know his Schollers forwardnes, as alſo how his conſtitution did now very well ſerue him, being wonderfull deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of his knight-hood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould now deale in the cauſe as beſt himſelfe pleaſed. No ſooner was the Giant informed hereof, but preſently he got him to Horſe-backe, and rode to the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, with whom he found <hi>Galaor,</hi> of more large ſtature then his yeeres expreſſed, very comely and beautyfull in euery parte, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he thus ſpake to him. I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Sonne, that you would be a Knight to follow Armes, truely you ſhall, prepare yourſelfe to go with me when time ſerueth, and your deſire ſhalbe honorably ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. Father anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> heerein conſiſteth the ſumme of mine affection: ſo not long after, the Giant departed from the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, taking <hi>Galaor</hi> with him, who falling on his knee before the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent olde man, deſired that as he had fatherly nourſhed him, ſo ſtill he would remember him in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout oriſons. The holy man with the teares tricling downe his cheekes, kiſſed and bleſſed him, then mounted <hi>Galaor</hi> on Horſ-back and followed the Giant, who brought him home to his Caſtell: where for certaine time he practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to combate at Armes, as alſo brauely to manage Horſes, hauing all things conuenient for the ſame, and two maiſters very expert there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. When he had continued a yeere at theſe exerciſes, the Giant ſeeing him worthy to receiue honor, &amp; ſtrong enough to endure chiualrie: diſpoſed thereon as you ſhall read hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Now againe doth the Author leaue him, and diſcourſeth of that which chanced to the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> who after he departed from King <hi>Perion</hi> and the Damoſell, rod two daies together, without any aduenture: and on the third about mid-day, he arriued at a very good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fortreſſe, that appertained to a Gentleman named <hi>Galpan.</hi> This <hi>Galpan</hi> was then the moſt valiant Knight in all that Country, and therefore was greatly feared of all his Neighbours, yet did he there maintaine an abhominable and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7179:22"/>
wicked cuſtome: forgetting God, who was cheefely to be honored, bequeathed his endeuours to the ſeruice of the Diuell. For he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained all Ladies and Damoſells that paſſed by his Caſtell, to enter in, where vilainouſly he tooke his pleaſure of them: and not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith, enforced them to ſweare, that while they liued they ſhould beare affection to none but him, if any denied, he cauſed them cruelly to be put to death. Likewiſe he compelled ſuch Knights as tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed that way, to combate one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, againſt his two bretheren, but if they were vanquiſhed, he would force the conquerour to deale with himſelfe, he being the moſt hardy knight in al thoſe parts. If it happened that he brought the into any debilitie, he would take from them all they had, turning them away on foote, after he had made them ſweare, to name them-ſelues while they liued, the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by <hi>Galpan,</hi> otherwiſe, hee would depriue them of life. But God diſpleaſed with the cruelty, which ſo long time he had vſed to the hurt of many good people, would now alter this great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, and that <hi>Galpan</hi> with his complices ſhould receiue guerdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their deſerts, making them an example to all other, as you ſhall heare preſently recited.</p>

This ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full woman breathed forth many griueous ſighes, ſhewing a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent kind of warre, betweene her hands and the golden treſſes of her haire, which ſhe diſcheueled and rent very pitifully. Hereat was the Prince not a little amazed, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to know what moued her to theſe extreames, he came to her with theſe ſpeeches. Faire Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I pray ye tel me the cauſe of your ſorrow. Ah my Lord, qd. ſhee, death would be now right welcome to me, being the onely friend to beare me company: for ſuch is my misfortune, as teares are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for me then rememberance of the cauſe. In ſooth Lady, ſaide the Prince, if in any reſpect I can do ye good, you ſhall find me rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy withall my hart. Being ſent Sir, quoth the Damoſell, by my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes commandement, to a yong Knight, a man of ſome account in theſe parts, and paſſing along this way: foure cruell villaines ſet vpon me, and (whether I would or no) brought me into this Caſtel where a traiterous Knight diſhonorably forced me, compelling me after-ward to ſweare, that I ſhould ne-uer loue any friend but him. This complaint moued the Prince to great admiration, and thus he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Follow me Lady, for your iniury ſhalbe reuenged, if God
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7179:23"/>
giue me leaue. Heereupon the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell immediatly went with him, and by the way he deſired her to tell him, what the man was to whom ſhe was ſent. If you reuenge my wrong quoth ſhe, I will tell ye: but I can aſſure ye he is ſuch a one, as will be right ſory when he hears of my miſuſage. Great reaſon, ſaid the Prince, hath he ſo to do: and as thus they communed together, they came to the place where ſhee ſhewed him the foure Gardants, to whom he preſently ſaid. Diſloyall varlets, wherefore haue ye abuſed this Lady as ſhe trauailed on her iournie? Becauſe (quoth they; wee ſtood in no feare of you: but if you get ye not the ſooner, your enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment ſhalbe worſe then hers was. Without any more talking he drew his Sword, and comming to one that heaued his hatchet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, quite cut away the right arme from his body: then turning to another, cleft him ouer the face to the very eares. When the reſt ſaw their companions thus mained, they fled away ſo faſt as they could, running through a by way along a Riuer ſide: but the Prince making no ſhew of purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, wiped his Sword and put it vp againe, then comming to the Damoſell, bad her go forward. My Lord, quoth ſhe, hard by is a gate, where I found two armed Knights attending. Well, ſaid he, and I ſhall find them when I come thether. So rode they on, &amp; as the Prince entred the baſe court, he ſaw the Dungeon dore open, and an armed Knight on Horſe-back come forth, after whom they within let downe a Port-cullis, and ſhut the dore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: then the Knight of the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell aduancing himſelfe, very bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus ſpake to the Prince. Poore wretch, too ſoone art thou come hether to receiue ſhame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor. Diſhonor? quoth Prince, tuſh theſe are but words, leaue what ſhall happen to the preſence of God, who only is skilfull there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: and tell if thou be the villaine that did force this Lady? No, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Knight, but if it were I, what then? I meane, quoth the Prince, to reuenge her wrong if I can. Go to, ſaid the Knight, I ſhall ſee then what kinde of reuendge you vſe. So giuing the Spurrs to his Horſe, ran as fiercely as he could againſt the Prince, yet he failed in the attaint: but the Prince meeting him with full carire, gaue him ſuch a greeting with his Launce through the Sheeld, as the armour being vnable to reſiſt it, let paſſe the yron through both his ſhoulders, whereby he fell downe dead in the place. Hauing with-drawne his Launce, prepared him-ſelfe for another that came to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor the firſt, who pearcing quite through the Princes Sheeld, left the head of his Launce in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which was of ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t profe: but in the encounter he met his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie ſo derectly, as he rent his Helmet from his head, caſting him ſo violently off his Saddle, as hee was able to ſit no more on Horſe-backe. The Knight ſeeing himſelfe thus vnarmed, cried for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to come helpe him, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three Halberders iſſued forth, to whom he ſaid: Looke well my friendes that this man eſcape vs not. At theſe words, they ranne all three violently on the Prince, and buckled ſo neere him, as they ſlew his Horſe betweene his leggs, whereby he was conſtrained to fight on foote: and ſo offended was he thereat, that hauing reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered himſelfe, he ſmote his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7179:23"/>
Launce through the Knights head, which made him preſently yeeld the ghoſt. And now he beſtirres himſelfe againſt the other three, who cowardly ſtealing behinde him, wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded him on the ſhoulder, whereby he loſt a great quantity of his bloud: but full well he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed the villaine that did it, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the deereſt bloud he had in his body, by cleauing him with his Sword as it bad beene an Axe. The other two terrified heer-with, ranne vp into a long Gallery, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Come my Lord, come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for we are all vanquiſhed. In meane while, the Prince ſeeing his owne Horſe was ſlaine, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on that belonged to the knight he ſlew laſt: ſoone after he ſaw an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Knight ſtand looking forth at a dore, who perceiuing the Prince had eſpied him, ſaid. What hath moued thee to come in heere and kill my people? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, anſwered the Prince, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the deſire I haue to reuenge this Lady, who hath beene here wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged moſt diſhonorably. As thus he ſpake, the Damoſell came to him, and knowing the Lord of the Caſtell that forced her, ſhe ſaid. Ah gentle Knight, ſee that this monſter eſcape you not, for by him haue I loſt my former honor. Libidinous Ruffian, quoth the Prince, deerely ſhalt thou pay for thy diſloyall dealing: Goe arme thee, elſe will I ſlay thee naked as thou art, for to thee or ſuch like villaines ought to be vſed no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: but the Damoſell more and and more ſtill cried. Kill, kill the Traitour, that hereafter he liue not to abuſe any more, otherwiſe will their ſhame be laid to your charge. Lewde woman, anſwered the Knight, in an euill hower came he hither by thy councell, and in thy company. And thou that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt me ſo brauely, attend my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and flie not away, for by no other meanes canſt thou warrant thy ſelfe. So he departed, and ſoon after came armed into the Court where he mounted on a luſty white Courſer: then comming to the Prince, he began to menace him, ſaying. Well maiſt thou curſſe the time that euer thou ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt this Damoſell, for it will coſt thee the price of thy head. Each one, ſaid the Prince, muſt keepe his head ſo well as he may, and he that cannot, let him looſe it. With-out longer ſtay they coutched their Launces, which at their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter ran into their Sheelds and armour, wounding ſome-what deep into their fleſh: and ſo forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly did their bodies meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they were both laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long on the ground, when quickly recouering themſelues, with their Swords drawne they prepare to the combate. Fierce and cruell ſtrokes were giuen on either ſide, to the great admiration of ſuch as beheld them, for many peeces of their Sheelds &amp; armour was ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred round about them: &amp; which is more, their Helmets were ſo torne and battered, as often times their bare heads bore off the blowes, ſo that the ground was coloured with their bloud: but <hi>Galpan</hi> had receiued a wound through the ſight of his Helmet, which made the bloud trickle into his eyes, and he to wipe them retited backe alit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. What <hi>Galpan?</hi> ſaid the Prince, deſireſt thou to breath? doſt thou not remember that thou fighteſt for my head? if thou defendeſt not thine owne well, thou art like to looſe it. Be patient a while, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Galpan,</hi> and let vs breath a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for we haue time enough to

With theſe words he gaue him ſuch a ſtroke on the head, as made him fall to the ground on his knees, yet quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he aroſe and tooke hart a freſh: but the Prince would not let him range about as he deſired, for hee was ſo out of breath, that he could hardly lift vp his Sword, wherefore he did nothing but croutch vnder his Sheeld, yet was it ſo ſliced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in peeces, as very little was left to defend himſelfe withall. <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi> ſeeing he had no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, began to flye before the Sword of his enimie, and at length (as his laſt refuge) thought to ſaue him-ſelfe in a little Tower which his Gardants vſed to ſtand in: but the Prince following him hard at the heeles, got him by the Helmet and puld it off, and giuing a full ſtroke at him, therwith ſmot his head from the ſhoulders, afterward he came to the Damoſell, ſaying. Faire Lady, now may you chouſe an other friend if you pleaſe, for he to whom you promiſed, hath diſcharged ye of the bargaine. Thankes be to God and you Sir, quoth ſhe: and as they returned from the Tower, they heard the dore ſhut too, wherefore he mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on <hi>Galpans</hi> Horſe, which was eſteemed one of the goodlyeſt in the world, and ſaid to the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.

Do not ſo, ſaid the Prince, for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage will be too troubleſome, but take the Helmet if you will. The Damoſell liking well of his aduiſe, commanded her Squire to cary it with him: and ſo they rode from the Caſtell, the ſeruants whereof were all gone, &amp; had left the gates wide open. But the Prince not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the Damoſels promiſe, that ſhe would tel him the Knights name ſhe was ſent vnto: therefore earneſtly he entreated her to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him therein.

Go then and ſay to him, that a Knight of his, humbly ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him, whom he ſhall find at the warres in <hi>Gaule</hi> when he commeth thither. Gentle Sir, quoth ſhe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you loue him ſo well, I pray ye grant me one requeſt. That will I, quoth the Prince. Let me then, ſaid ſhe, vnderſtand your name. Lady, quoth he, at this time forbeare the knowledge thereof, and command what elſe you pleaſe, you ſhall not be denied. No other thing will I deſire anſwered the Damoſell. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me, ſaid the Prince, it is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle courteſie to requeſt the thing, which willingly I would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale to any one.

not a little glad that ſhe knew his name: but when he was gone from her, he remembred the wound on his ſhoulder, which ſtill bled very freſhly, ſo that he might eaſily be tract by his bloud, &amp; on his white Horſe it had dropt in many places. At euening he came ſome-what neere a Fortreſſe, where he beheld a knight vnarmed comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, and after he had well viewed him, he ſaid. My Lord, I pray you tell me where haue you beene ſo wounded? In ſooth, quoth the Prince, at a Caſtle not very far hence. And how, ſaid the Knight, came you by that goodly white Horſe; I tooke it, anſwered the Prince, in requitall of mine owne, that was there ſlaine by traiterous villaines. But would <hi>Galpan,</hi> quoth the Knight, ſuffer ye ſo to do? Yea mary Sir, replied the Prince, he is now become more patient, for hee hath endured the loſſe of his head. When the Knight heard of <hi>Galpans</hi> death, he preſently alighted fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Ah Gentle Knight, how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly am I indebted to you; you are to this place the moſt wellcome man in the world, for by your meanes haue I thorowly recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mine honor.

In my houſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the knight, abideth a Neece of mine, who ſhal heale your hurts better then any other.

It may be (my Lord) a yong Knight, with whom the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> and my ſelfe were certaine daies, and then we left him when wee came thither. Knoweſt thou his name? quoth the King. No my Lord, quoth the Squire, but hee is both yong and very beautyfull: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide I ſaw him do ſuch rare deeds of Chiualrie in ſo little time, as in mine opinion if I liue, he will proue one of the beſt Knights in the world. Then diſcourſed he at large euery action, as alſo how hee deliuered King <hi>Perion</hi> in the time of great danger. When the King had noted well his taile, his deſire to know him increaſed now more and more. My Lord, quoth the Squire, the Damoſell that came hether with me, happily can tel ye more tydings of him, for it was my chance to meet them together. Of what Damoſell ſpeakeſt thou? ſaid the King. Of her, anſwered the Squire, that lately came from great <hi>Brittaine</hi> to Madame <hi>Oriana.</hi> Preſently was ſhe ſent for, and hee demanded what the Knight was of whom there went ſuch reporte.

Ah God, ſaid the King, how may it be?

tune their Notes moſt pleaſantly, and that all Trees, Herbes, and Flowers declare the comming of the Spring time: this delightſome change made him remember her, who aboue all other flowred in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent beautie, and for whom (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning his libertie) Loue hath taken him captiue, ſo that in theſe thoghts, he thus (ſomewhat loud) parled with himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Ah poore <hi>Gentleman of the Sea,</hi> without Parents or Lands, that thou canſt auouch, how durſt thou lift thy heart ſo high, as to loue her who is beyond all other in beautie, bounty, and birth? Ah wretch as thou art, oughteſt thou not to conſider by theſe three things, wherein ſhe is moſt perfect: the beſt Kinght in the world may not be ſo hardy as to thinke of louing her? And thou poore vnknowne, art wrapt in a labirinth of folly, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and dying, not daring to tell it, or make ſhew thereof. In this complaint was the <hi>Gentleman of the Sea</hi> ſo carryed away, as forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all other matters, hee rode croſſe the forreſt a long ſpace, with his Helmet cloſed: till at length lifting vp his head, hee behelde a Knight well mounted, in the wood by him, who long had kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to heare his ſadde diſcourſe. When the knight ſawe the Prince had diſcryed him &amp; for that cauſe held his peace, he approched nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer him with theſe words. Beleeue me knight, it ſeems you more loue your Friend then ſhee doth you, when in commending her you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe your ſelfe: and for ought I vnderſtand by your ſpeeches, you are no ſuch man as ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend loue, therefore it is neceſſarie I ſhould know who ſhee is, to the end I may ſupply your defect and ſerue her. Sir knight (anſwered the Prince) you haue ſome reaſon for theſe ſpeeches, yet hap what ſhall, you can know no more then you doe: and I can aſſure yee, that by louing her you can get no aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. So doe not I beleeue, ſayd the knight, for a man ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue glory in trauaile, or any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the ſeruice of ſo faire a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſeeing that in the end, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but gaine his long looked for recompence: wherefore hee that loueth in ſo high a place as you doe, ſhould not be agreeued at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that happeneth. When the Prince heard him ſpeake ſo ſenſibly, imagining hee vſed theſe wordes to comfort him, he was of better cheere, and came more neere to him to continue this talk, but the Knight ſayd. Keepe yee backe, for either by friend-ſhip or force, you muſt tell mee what I haue demaunded. Now truſt me, anſwered the Prince, it ſhall not be ſo. Goe too then, quoth the knight, ſee what wil happen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and defend your ſelfe. With right good will ſayde the Prince. So gan they lace their Helmets, taking likewiſe their Shieldes and Lances: but as they ſeuered them-ſelues for the Iouſt, a Damoſell came and ſpake in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Knights, I pray you forbeare a while, and tell mee one thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the combate if you can: for ſuch is my haſte, as I haue no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to tarry the end of your fight. At theſe words they ſtayed them-ſelues, demanding of her what ſhe deſired. I would fame, quoth ſhee, heare ſome news of a Knight, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Gentleman of the Sea.</hi> And what would you with him? ſaid the Prince. I haue brought him ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, anſwered the Damoſell, from <hi>Agraies</hi> Sonne to the King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Attend a little, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7179:27"/>
the Prince, and I will tell ye ſo much as I know of him. All this time was the Knight of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ready for the Iouſt, and much offended at her that came to ſtay them, wherefore hee called to the Prince to gaurd him-ſelfe, giuing him ſuch an attaint in the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as his Launce ſlew in pieces: but the Prince met him full, as both Horſe and Man were thrown to the ground, when the Horſe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more nimble then his Maiſter) ſeeing him ſelfe at libertie, ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the field, yet the Prince found the meanes to take him againe, and bringing him to the diſmounted knight, ſayd, Heere Sir, take your Horſe, and hence-forth deſire not to know any thing againſt a mans will. The knight would not refuſe his gentleneſſe, forhe found him-ſelfe ſo ſhaken with his fall, as hee could hardly follow to catch him again &amp; in meane while he aſſayed to remount on his Horſe, the Prince left him, comming to the Damoſell that ſtayed for him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding if ſhe knew the man ſhe enquired after. No truely, quoth ſhe, I did neuer ſee him: but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> told me, that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently make himſelfe knowne, ſo ſoone as I ſhould ſay that I came from him. He did not deceiue you therein anſwered the Prince, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye muſt vnderſtand I my ſelfe am the man: and with theſe words he vnlaced his Helmet, when the Damoſell ſaw his face, ſhe ſaid. In truth now doe I verily beleeue it, for your beauty I haue heard very much commended. Then tell me, quoth the Prince, where haue you left <hi>Agraies?</hi> Hard by a Riuer not farre hence, ſayd ſhe, where he ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with his Troupe, attending a fit winde for Paſſage into <hi>Gaule:</hi> and is very deſirous (before he go any further) to know if you will beare him companie. With all my heart, replyed the Prince, ride then before and conduct mee the way. So rode he on with the Damoſell, and in ſome ſhort time after, they came neer the place where <hi>Agraies</hi> and his Armie were encamped: but yet before they arriued there, they heard behinde them one cry: Stay knight, for thou muſt tell me what I demanded. The Prince tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning backe, behold the knight who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſo lately diſmounted, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that bare him company, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſtayed to take his Armes. Now were they ſo neere the Prince <hi>Agraies</hi> Campe, and he as they all might ſee the Tourney, hauing a farre off noted the Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, maruailing what he was that ſo gallantly managed his Horſe: and to ſay ſooth, hee was (in his time) a Knight of the comlyeſt grace that euer was ſeen, &amp; where he ſtroue to hide himſelfe, he was ſooneſt diſcouered, by reaſon of his brauery in horſeman-ſhip. The two Knights ran together in full courſe againſt him, breaking their Lances in pieces on his ſhield: but the Prince meeting him that had the foile in the forreſt, threw him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſaddle ſo roughly, as in the fall he brake his arme, the grief whereof made him lie ſtill as if he had bin dead. When he perceiued he was ſo well rid of one, hee drew his ſword: &amp; came to the other, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him ſuch a ſtroke on his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, as the Sword entringlin, hee puld it backe with ſuch force, that the laces brake, wherby he broght it quite fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his head vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſword: then he lifted vp his arme to haue ſmitten him, but the knight quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clapt his Shield before. In mean while the Prince got his ſword in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his left hand (which hee could
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7179:28"/>
doe very hardly) and with his right hand tooke holde on his enemies ſhield, renting it violently from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, and afterward gaue him ſuch a blow on the head, as in great amazement hee fell to the ground. Thus did hee leaue him there with his companion, and rod with the Damoſell to the Tents of <hi>Agraies:</hi> who hauing ſeen the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this quarrell, meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling what he was that had ſo ſoone ouer-come two knights, therefore when he came towardes him, hee went foorth to meete him, and ſo ſoone as they knew each other, you need not make no doubt of their kinde ſalutations. Soone after the Prince alighted, and by <hi>Agraies</hi> was conducted into his Tent to be vnarmed, but firſt hee gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that the knights diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted in the fielde ſhould bee brought thither, where they were no ſooner ariued, but <hi>Agrais</hi> thus ſpake to them. Beleeue mee, my friends, you attempted great folly to meddle with this Knight. You ſay true my Lord, anſwered hee whoſe arme was broken, yet once to day I ſaw him in ſuch plight, as I little thought of any ſuch reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Afterward he declared all that happened in the Forreſt, and the communication they had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: yet he omitted the Princes complaints becauſe hee ſtood in feare to diſpleaſe him. During the repitition of theſe matters, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the one and boldneſſe of the other, was entercourſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and all that day they ſoiourned there, but on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Morning they mounted on horſe-backe, ſhaping their courſe to <hi>Palingues,</hi> a right good City on the frontires, and the outmoſt part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they found ſhipping, and embarqued them-ſelues toward <hi>Gaule.</hi> The winde ſeruing according to their deſire, in fewe dayes they landed in the Hauen of <hi>Galfrin,</hi> and marching thence in ſeemely order, with-out any hinderance, they came to the Caſtle of <hi>Baldain,</hi> where King <hi>Perion</hi> was befieged, hauing alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy loſt great number of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When he was aduertiſed of this ſuccour, you muſt imagine him comforted thereby, and their welcome to bee good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: chiefly by the Queene <hi>Eliſena,</hi> who hauing knowledge of their arriuall, ſent to entreat her Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Agraies</hi> to come viſite her: which he did, being accompanied with the King, and the <hi>Gentleman of the Sea,</hi> and two other knights of good account. But you muſt note, that king <hi>Perio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> knew not the prince at the firſt ſight, yet at the length he called him to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, that it was the ſame man whom he had knighted, and afterward ſaued his life at the Caſtle, wherefore thus he ſpake. My deare friend, on my faith I had forgotten ye, you are moſt welcome to this place, for your preſence giueth aſſurance, that I neede feare this warre no further, hauing the onely Knight of the world ſo neere mee. Dread Lord, anſwered the Prince, God giue me grace to ſerue you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, for perſwade your ſelfe, that while theſe troubles endure, I will make no ſpare of my perſon.</p>
                  <p>As thus they deuiſed, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Queenes Chamber, when the King taking the Prince by the hand, preſented him to her ſaying.

At this time likewiſe was her remembrance ſolicited, with the former loſſe of her two Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe yeeres ſhe thought would haue equaled the Princes, if God had preſerued them, &amp; theſe occaſions vrged the teares in her eyes. Thus wept ſhe for him that nature touched her withall, and yet vnknowen was in her preſence, but when the Prince beheld her ſo ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, he reputed it to the reaſon of the warre begun, wherefore hee ſaid. Madame, I hope with the aide of God, your King, and the freſh ſupply we haue brought: in ſhorte time to recouer your ioy, and for mine owne part, truſt me I will make no ſpare. Heauen proſper ye, anſwered the Queene, with happy ſucceſſe, &amp; for you are the Queene my ſiſters Knight, I wil that ye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide no other lodging, but abide here with vs, and all things ſhall be appointed for yee to your owne contentment. Such was their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference together, vntill <hi>Agraies</hi> would goe refreſh himſelfe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking leaue for that night, he went to his lodging where it was prouided: and gladly would the Prince haue followed him, but the Queene with held him by ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, as he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained now to remaine in his vnknowne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cuſtody. Right ſoone was the news of this freſh ſuccour, brought to K. <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> &amp; <hi>Daganel</hi> his Cozin, who made very ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof, becauſe (in thoſe times) was King <hi>Abies</hi> accounted for one of the beſt Knights that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was heard of, and in reſpect of his hot deſire to the fight, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (ſeeing new aide was come to his enimy) very quickly to bid him battaile, and for this cauſe he ſaid before all his people there preſent.

worthy Duke giue order, that all things bee done as you haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Now might ye there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold armed men on Horſe-backe, the Souldiers muſtring, the drums thundering, and the Trumpets cheerefully founding, as in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, matters were ſo well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Kings Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment failed in nothing: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the next morning at the breake of day, <hi>Daganel</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Normandie,</hi> ſhewed themſelues with their Squadron before the Towne. Little did King <hi>Perion</hi> at that time thinke of any ſuch enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, but altogether refreſhed his ſuccour, and honoured the Prince by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had found ſuch friend-ſhip. And to make ſome ſhew of his affection towardes him, in the morning he came with his Queene to the Princes Chamber. where they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him waſhing his hands, and perceiuing his eyes red, ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len &amp; blubbered with teares, they eaſily gathered hee had taken no good reſt that night: and very true it was, for continually hee thought of her, whoſe loue had depriued him of libertie, and likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared withall the ſlender means he had to attaine ſo high, which made him enter into ſuch profound griefe, as he expected no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie but death. The Queene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know the cauſe of his ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, tooke <hi>Gandalin</hi> aſide, thus ſpeaking to him. My friend, your Maiſters countenance berayweth ſome inward diſpleaſure, hath any one heere offended him in ought? No Madame, anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> he hath by your Maieſtie receiued great honor: but he is wont to bee tormented in ſleepe as you ſee. During theſe diſcourſes, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinell came to aduertiſe the King, how he had diſcoured the ambuſh and the enemies were very neere the Citie, where preſently he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to doraine the Armie. Now was each one ready to horſe-backe, eſpecially the King and the Prince, who went directly to the Citie gate, where they found <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> chiding, becauſe they would not let him goe forth, thinking he ſhould tarrie too long from the fight: for he was one of the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Knights, and the beſt to giue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in neede that could bee found, ſo that if good aduiſe had beene as ready with him, as he was poſſeſſed of vnconquerable cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, his like might not haue beene found in the world. At the Kings comming the gates were ſuddenly opened, and then went foorth the men of <hi>Gaule</hi> in order, who ſeeing their enemies to be ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, albeit the whole Armie was minded to goe no further, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ouer-much boldneſſe to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile ſuch an vneaquall ſtrength, and therefore aroſe among them a murmuring conteſtation. Which <hi>Agraies</hi> perceiuing, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trifling gaue the ſpurres to his horſe, crying aloud, Beſhrow him that tarrieth any longer: ſeeing them hee is to deale withall, ſhall we not venter? So ſaying, he gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopped toward his enemies, in like manner did the <hi>Gentleman of the Sea,</hi> and the reſt of their traine, who without any order of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, ran among them, and were immediatly mingled together. He whom the Prince firſt met withall, was the Duke of <hi>Normandie,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he charged ſo couragiouſly, as breaking his Launce on him, ouer-threw both man and horſe to the earth, and with this rough fall, his legge was broken. So paſſed on the Prince ſetting hand to Sword, as a chafed Lyon entred the preaſſe,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7179:29"/>
ſhewing ſuch deeds of Armes, as none durſt with-ſtand him: for he ouer-threw all that encountred him, killing ſome outright, chining and diſmembring others, ſo that euery one was glad to giue him way. When <hi>Daganel</hi> ſaw his men in ſuch diſorder, by the meanes of one Knight, he got the moſt of them together ſo well as he could, and round about beſet the Prince to beate him downe: which they had done, but that <hi>Agraies</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it, came with his troupe to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue him. At their arriual you might behold Launces broken, Knights tumbling downe, helmets rent, and ſhields ſcatred on the ground ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a great conflict &amp; diſorder, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Iriſh-men,</hi> for King <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> likewiſe came freſh vpon them with his band. <hi>Daganel</hi> (on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide) did the beſt he could to retire backe, but the <hi>Gentleman of the Sea</hi> was among the thickeſt, ſhewing ſuch chiualry, as he found before him not any reſiſtance, each one was ſo abaſhed at his behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: and <hi>Agraies</hi> aboue the reſt, ſhewed that his arme was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed, for the more to hearten and cheere vp his men, he cryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loude to them: follow my friends, follow the beſt Knight that euer bare Armes. When <hi>Daganel</hi> ſaw his ſide to haue the worſt, &amp; what great damage he receiued by the Prince, he determined to kill his horſe, and ſo to make him fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the crowde: but he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for the Prince comming to him, let fall ſo mightie a ſtroke on his Helmet, as rent it cleane from off his head, and ſo remained <hi>Daganel</hi> vnarmed. Which when King <hi>Perion</hi> eſpied he reached him ſuch a ſalutation with his Sword, as cleft his head through the very braines: whereupon his men ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſlaine, they that had the beſt horſes fled away for life, and ſtayed not till they ſaued them-ſelues where King <hi>Abies</hi> was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhed. But King <hi>Perion</hi> ſtill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing victory, diſcouered the rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard (that came from the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt) marching in very great haſte toward him, ſhewing by their countenance a reuenge of their loſſe, wherefore ioyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they cryed; Set on them men of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſee that none of them eſcape vs, but let vs enter pell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell in the field. When the <hi>Gaules</hi> found themſelues thus ſurpized, neuer were people more aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, for they imagined the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh had not beene ſo great, and which moſt of all affrighted them, was, that they muſt now deale with freſh and luſtie men, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolues being ſore wearyed, &amp; their horſes ſo ouer-laboured, as they could hardly indure their burden. Beſide, they knew king <hi>Abias</hi> was there in perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being (as you heard before) accounted one of the beſt knights in the world: and for this cauſe the moſt part of the <hi>Gaules</hi> began to tremble.

theſe words the moſt diſheartened tooke courage, concluding to ſtay and fight manly with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who ſoone after in great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſet vpon them. Now did King <hi>Abies</hi> make knowne his magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and hardly could Prince <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> men endure the aſſault, nor the Squadron that King <hi>Perion</hi> brought: for King <hi>Abies</hi> maimed ſome, other he ouerthrew, &amp; while his Launce held, he diſmounted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery knight that met with him. Afterward he layd hand to Sword, wherewith hee carried himſelfe ſo valiantly, as the hardyeſt were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed thereat, for he made way where euer he came: ſo that king <hi>Perions</hi> men, not able longer to hold out, began to retyre ſo faſt as they could toward the Citie. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Gentleman of the Sea,</hi> ſaw that Fortune was ſo contrary to them, in great ſpight he entered the throng, and fought ſo fiercely, as the moſt part of the <hi>Iriſh-men</hi> were glad to ſtay, while the <hi>Gaules</hi> with-out diſorder retyred toward the Caſtle, then turning his horſe, he followed them. To defend this brunt there was alſo king <hi>Perion,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Agraies,</hi> who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered teſtimonie to their enemies (by the keen edge of their Swords) how well they knew to gouerne themſelues in ſuch extremities: notwithſtanding, the <hi>Iriſh-men</hi> ſeeing they had the better, ſtil pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them with eagar courage, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them confuſedly into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hoping that now would be the end of their warre. Such was the retire of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> ſtill more and more preſſed by their enemies, as doubtleſſe the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had entred the Citie after them, but that they were hindred by king <hi>Perion, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies,</hi> and the Prince, who whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did repulſe the throng, till their people by them were gotten in. But now was tydings brought to king <hi>Abies,</hi> that his couſin <hi>Dagenel,</hi> and <hi>Gallin</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> were ſlaine, whereat he waxed very diſpleaſant: and ſeeing King <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with his people were incloſed in the Citie, he reſolued to take leyſure for his reuenge, wherein he was deceiued, for ſoone after he was very ſtrongly repulſed, which made him almoſt mad with anger. And as he thus raged vp &amp; downe, one of his knights ſhewed him the Prince, ſaying: My Lord, hee whom you ſee mounted on the white Horſe, is the man that ſlewe Prince <hi>Daganel</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Normandie,</hi> with many other, the beſt in our Armie. When King <hi>Abies</hi> heard that, he rode to the Prince with theſe words: Knight, thou haſt ſlaine the man whom moſt I loued in the world: but if thou wilt combate, I hope to be reuenged ſo well, as I ſhall haue cauſe to be quit with thee. Your men (anſwered the Prince) are two little trauailed to meddle with ours, notwithſtanding if thou wilt as (a Knight) reuenge him thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedſt, and declare the great hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for which thou art renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: chuſe of thy men ſuch as thou ſhalt like, and I (if it pleaſe the King) will doe as much of mine, for being equall in number, thou ſhalt gaine more honor then with ſo great an Armie, which thou haſt brought into this Countrey with-out iuſt occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Beleeue me, quoth the King, thou talkeſt well, go to, chuſe thou thy ſelfe the number of men, how many or few thou thinkeſt good. Seeing you leaue it in my choyſe, replied the Prince, I will make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offer, which (it may be) you will account more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient. You
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7179:30"/>
are mine enemy for that which I haue done, and I yours for the wrong you haue done to this Realme, ſo for our ſeuerall cauſe of anger, it is not reaſonable any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then our ſelues ſhould ſuffer: let then the battaile be betweene you and me onely, and preſently (if you will) without longer dallying, yet ſhall you aſſure me from your men, as I will do you from mine, ſo that none ſhall moue, whether the one or the other be vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Right well ſaid King <hi>Abies,</hi> do I allow of thy offer: whereupon he choſeten Knights on his parte to garde the field. And as the Prince laboured to gaine the like of the King, with his conſent, hee found King <hi>Perion</hi> and <hi>Agraies</hi> ſomewhat loath to grant the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: as well for the conſequence that might enſue, as alſo becauſe the Prince was much wearyed and ſore wounded beſide, wherefore they entreated him to deferre the matter till the day following. But the deſirous affection he had to be conquerour, as alſo to make a finall concluſion of the warre, that hee might roturne vnder her obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, from whom he came to ſerue king <hi>Perion:</hi> would not ſuffer him to make any longer delay, of the glory and honor which he ſaw ſo neere at hand. For this cauſe he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo many perſwaſions to the king, as in the end hee was granted the Combate, and on his ſide like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were tenne knights appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for his guard and ſafetie in the field.</p>

                     </gap> famous Knight, God giue thee grace to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as thou haſt begun: impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is it to find a Gentleman, ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed with beauty and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie as he is, for our eyes are iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the one, and our enemies full well haue felt the other. But you muſt note, that in the morning when they went to the field, the King had giuen the Queene in charge, that ſo ſoone as the Prince returned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the warre, ſhe ſhould ſend one of her Ladyes to him, requeſting him not to be vnarmed in any other place then in her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: wherefore as he went neere the Kings lodging, the Lady came

Sir Knight, the Queene deſires you not to be elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where vnarmed, but in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where ſhe ſtayeth your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. In ſooth, ſaid the King, you muſt needes grant this requeſt, and I deſire it may be ſo. The Prince condiſending, went where the Queene ſtaied with her Ladies, and no ſooner was he entred, but preſently the Ladyes holpe to vn-arme him: yet the Queene her ſelfe tooke the greateſt paine of all, and as ſhee had off his coate of Mayle, ſhee perceiued he was ſore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which ſhe ſhewing to the King, he ſaid. I maruaile Gentle-man, ſeeing you are ſo hurt, that you tooke no longer time for your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat. It had bin needleſſe, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Prince, for I haue no wound (I thanke God) that can keepe me from the Combate. Right ſoone were the Chirurgions comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to looke thereon, and they found it greater in ſhew then dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. In the meane while ſupper was prepared, during which time, they had much talke of the accidents that day paſt: vntill the houre of reſt came, when each one depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted till the next morning. Which being come, after they had ſerued God, the king ſent a rich &amp; goodly Armour to the Prince, of better proofe and ſtrength then that hee had on the day before: wherewith he armed himſelfe, and hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken leaue of euery one, mounted on Horſe-backe in company of the King, who bare his Helmet, the Prince <hi>Agraies</hi> his Sheeld (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was portrayed two azured Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a golden field, rampant the one againſt the other, as if they both inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded murder,) &amp; another Prince carried his Launce. In this equipage he ſet forward to the field, where the King of <hi>Ireland</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his comming, well armed, and mounted on a goodly blacke Courſer: but becauſe King <hi>Abies</hi> had in former time fought hand to hand with a Giant, and vanquiſhed him with the loſſe of his head, therefore he brought to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the like figure in his Shield, deſcribing the whole order as the deede was done. On either ſide re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted thither a number of people, placing themſelues for moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient ſight of the Combate. And now were the Champions entred the lyſts, each one couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reſoluing againſt his enemy, wherefore without longer tarying, lacing downe the ſight of their Helmets, and commending them-ſelues to God: they gaue the ſpurres to their horſes, meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo furiouſly, both with Launce, body and horſe, as their ſtaues flew in ſhiuers, yet piercing their Armour, and both were laid along in the field. But heat of hart and deſire of conqueſt, made them recouer footing quickly, and pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forth the ſpields of their Launces wherewith they were wounded: ſet hand to Sword, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſuch a ſtrange and cruell fight, as each one was amazed to ſee them endure ſo much. For this fight was not equally matched, in reſpect the Prince was but yong, well proportioned, and of a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able height: but King <hi>Abies</hi> was ſo great, as he neuer found any knight that exceeded him a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full euery way, being (withall) ſo ſtrongly made, that he was rather to be accounted a Giant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man, yet was he highly loued &amp; reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of his ſubiects, for the vertue and proweſſe which remained in him, albeit he was too much audati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and proud.</p>
                  <p>Now were theſe Champions ſo

animated againſt each other, as well for honor as the conſequence of the Combate, that without any ſtay for breathing they layde on ſuch load, as their ſtrokes reſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the fight of twentie men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And well they witneſſed no great good will betweene them, for there might ye ſee the earth tainted with their blood, the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Shields, the plate of their Armour ſcattered abroad, and their Helmets ſo bruiſed: that by reaſon their Armes being ſo ſquandered, they were vnable to hold out their ſtrokes, for euery blow cauſed the blood to guſh out abundantly, yet were they of ſuch inuincible courage, as they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to feele none of this annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Hereupon they maintained ſuch brauery the one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as it could not be iudged who had the better or worſe: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, about the houre of three, the Sunne gaue an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding warme and violent heate, whereby they found themſelues ſo chaſed in their Armour, as they began to waxe ſomewhat feeble: eſpecially King <hi>Abies,</hi> inſomuch as hee was conſtrained to retire backe, thus ſpeaking to the Prince.</p>

Which when the Prince beheld, he gaue him ſuch a furious ſtroke on the left leg, that being quite cut from the reſt, the King was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fall downe: and right ſoone did the Prince ſet foote vppon him, rearing violently his Helmet from his head, ſaying.

                  <p>Now muſt ye vnderſtand, that a little before the beginning of the Combate, the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi> who came from faire <hi>Oriana</hi> to the Prince, was arriued at king <hi>Perions</hi> Courte: and-before ſhee would make her ſelfe knowne, ſhe deſired to behold the iſſue of the fight.

For thinking on her perfection, I ſeeke to augment it by ſtrength and commendation, but of ſo ſlender value is my puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance found: that ſtriuing thereby to gaine her fauor, the leaſt paine I feele ſurpaſſeth a thouſand deaths: which (neuertheleſſe) are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced by this preſent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. O higheſt God, when ſhall I ſee the time, wherein I may giue her to vnderſtand, how great my deuotion is to obey her by ſome agreeable ſeruice? Hauing finiſhed theſe words, he opened the Letter, and ſaw his Name written therein, which was <hi>Amadis:</hi> then thus ſpake the Damoſell againe to him. I was charged, Sir, when I had done my Meſſage, to returne with all ſpeed to her that ſent me to you; therefore be-thinke your ſelfe if you will command me any thing. You ſhall not depart (ſo pleaſe you) in ſuch haſte, anſwered the Prince, but ſtay with mee two or three dayes: during which time, for what occaſion ſo euer it be, you ſhall not forſake me, and then will I conduct you whither you pleaſe. In obeying you (ſayd the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,

Then came the Queene with her Ladyes &amp; Gentle-women to vnarme him, and the Chirurgions to viſite his wounds, which when they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, albeit they were many and yrkeſom to behold, yet were they to bee healed without any great daunger of his perſon. For this night the king deſired, that he and <hi>Agraies,</hi> would ſupp with him, but the <hi>Prince</hi> making his excuſe by his wounds, went to his Chamber, willing to haue no other company then the Damoſel: to whom he did all the honour that could be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, hoping through her to finde remedie for part of his griefes. This Damoſell ſoiourned with him certaine time, and in reſpect of the good Newes ſhee brought him, no wound could hinder him from viſiting the great Hall, there walking and conferring with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one: but moſt with her whom he cauſed to ſtay, attending his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> till he might beare Armes. And betweene them happened a ſtrange occaſion, which was cauſe of his longer abode in <hi>Gaule,</hi> then hee expected: ſo that the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell returned to <hi>Oriana</hi> without him, as you hereafter ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>

                     <p>How the <hi>Gentleman of the Sea</hi> was knowne by King <hi>Perion,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by the Queene <hi>Eliſena</hi> his Mother.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the beginning of this Hiſtorie, it hath beene recited, how King <hi>Perion</hi> gaue his Queene <hi>Eliſena,</hi> being then in little <hi>Brittaine,</hi> a Ring like another that commonly hee wore, and theſe two Rings were of ſuch an vniforme, as there was no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to bee diſcerned betweene them. Likewiſe ye haue vnderſtood how when the yong Prince was put vpon the water, this Ring was faſtened about his necke, which <hi>Gandales</hi> kept, till time he ſent it by the Damoſell (a little before he was knighted) with the Sword and the waxe. Now had the King ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times demaunded of the Queene for the Ring, who made him diuers doubtfull anſwers, and in the end ſayd ſhe had loſt it. But it came to paſſe, that as the Prince walked with <hi>Orianaes</hi> Damoſell, which commonly he was wont to do, yong <hi>Melicia</hi> daughter to king <hi>Perion,</hi> paſſed by him weeping, when the Prince ſtaied her; ſaying. Faire friend, why weepe ye? Ah my Lord, quoth the Princeſſe, I haue euen now loſt a Ring, which the King my Father gaue me to keepe while he ſlept. Weepe not ſo faire Virgin, anſwered the Prince, you ſhall haue another of me to giue him: So taking his owne Ring from his finger, he gaue it her. When ſhe beheld it, (thinking it was the ſame ſhe had loſt) ſhe ſaid. Ah my Lord, haue you found it, wherewith I am not a little glad, for I haue all this while ſought it. What nowe? quoth the Prince, this is not your
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7179:33"/>
Ring. In mine opinion it is, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Melicia,</hi> or the onely thing of the world that moſt reſembles it. So much the better, ſaid the Prince, for more eaſily will it be iudged the ſame you loſt. Herewith went <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia</hi> to the Kings Chamber, and finding him awake, he asked her for his Ring, then gaue ſhe him the ſame ſhe had of the Prince, which the King put on his finger, thinking it was his owne. But ſoone after as he walked through the Gallary, he eſpied in a corner lying the other Ring, which he gaue his daughter before to keepe, and taking it vp, he compared them together: where-upon he remembred, that one of theſe two was the ſame he ſome-time gaue the Queene, ſo he asked of <hi>Melicia</hi> where ſhe had the Ring. The yong Princeſſe affraid of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, durſt not lye, but thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. My Lord and Father, your Ring I loſt, and as I ſearched for it, I met with the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea:</hi> who becauſe he ſaw me weepe, gaue me one of his, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered you in ſtead of your owne, and if that be not it, I know not where it is. When the King heard this, he preſently conceiued ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene his Queene and the Prince, imagining in reſpect of his beauty, how ſhe was fallen into ſome diſhoneſt liking of him. and therefore had giuen that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Hereupon he went to the Chamber where ſhe was, and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the dore, ſate downe by her, not ſpeaking one word a good ſpace, but ſilently fixed his eyes on the ground: then breathing forth a paſſionate ſigh, he ſaid. I will not maruaile any longer Madame, why you would neuer make me any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine anſwer, when I demanded for the Ring I gaue ye in little <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:</hi> you haue loſt it in ſuch a place, where you would be loath I ſhould know of it, but hardly can you conceale affection, when it proceedeth to ſuch effects. The <hi>Gentleman of the ſea</hi> inconſideratly gaue it to <hi>Melicia,</hi> little thinking that it came at the firſt from me: and thereby do I know what he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth not, and your ſelfe would I ſhould not vnderſtand. When the Queene (who already by his countenance ſaw he was troubled) heard what he had ſaid, ſhe now determined not to diſſemble with him in any thing, but ſummarily made a true diſcourſe of her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth. And (not without teares) ſhe recounted to him, how ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in feare of the king her father, as alſo the ſeuere law vſed in his Kingdome, ſhe was conſtrained to commit her ſonne to the mercy of the ſea, and in his cradle coffin put with him, both the Ring, ſword, &amp; what elſe hath bene already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Confounded was the king with maruaile when he heard the whole truth, and preſently imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Prince might bee his firſt ſonne, whom God had ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly preſerued, wherefore he ſaid to the Queene. According to your circumſtances reuealed, it may be, that he who is vnknowne to vs, is our ſonne, and the rather I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture ſo by the name he beareth of the ſea. Ah God, ſaid the Queen, may it fall out ſo haply? I beſeech ye my Lord, ſend preſently for him, and we will deſire him to tell vs of whence he is. Let vs go then, quoth the King, to ſeeke him.</p>
                  <p>So went they to his Chamber, where they found him ſleeping, wherefore (without making any noyſe) he approched nere the bed, eſpied his Sword, which he tooke, and after he had well viewed it, knew it to be the ſame he eſteemed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7179:34"/>
ſo much, and wherewith he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed many famous aduentures, whereupon he ſaid to the Qeuene. On my faith, this is the ſword I left in the Chamber of the King your Father, the firſt night we were acquainted together, and now do I the better beleeue what you haue ſaid vnto me. Ah God, ſaid the Queene, let vs ſuffer him ſleepe no longer, for my hart cannot endure this weighty burden: herewith ſhe tooke him by the hand and awaked him, ſaying. My Lord, ſleepe no more at this time, for other accaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons calleth you. Eaſily was the Prince raiſed from ſleepe, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he beheld the Queene weeping, as one amazed thereat, he ſaid. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, from what occaſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede theſe teares? is there any thing I may do ye ſeruice in, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy them? Noble friend, quoth the Queene, you onely may qualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my griefe by your words, in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me whoſe ſonne you are. So God helpe me Madame, anſwered the Prince, I know not, for by ſtrange aduenture was I found in the ſea. The good Lady was then ſo ouercome with ioy, as not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeech, but vitall ſence was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from her, and ſhe fell downe in a ſwoune: which the Prince per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, quickly ranne to recouer her, ſaying. What aile ye Madame? further could he not imagine on the cauſe of this alteration. Ah my ſonne, quoth ſhe, now know I bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then thy ſelfe who thou art. The King likewiſe was ſo caried away with ioy and admiration, as he ſtood not able to ſpeake a word: now was it hard to iudge, which of theſe three felt greateſt contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the mother throwing her armes about the Princes neck, ſaid. Now may I boldly dare to kiſſe in ſafetie, hauing beene ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of thy ſight and knowledge: highly am I beholding to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine bounty, who hath fauoured the offence I committed through feare, which was, in deliuering thee to the courtiſie of the waters, and ſee heere thy Kingly father that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got thee. With theſe words the Prince fell at their feete, extreame ioy reducing the teares into his eyes, and altogether praiſed God for this good aduenture: eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Prince, becauſe he had beene preſerued in ſo great danger, and now at length to finde ſuch honor and good hap, as to meete with his Parents, being all this while vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to them. As thus they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed on the fortunes paſſed, the Queene demanded of him if hee had no other name, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which now he called himſelfe by? Yes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, quoth he, but it is not fully three daies paſt ſince I knew there-of, for as I came from the Combat againſt King <hi>Abies,</hi> a Damoſell brought me a Letter which I haue, and (as ſhe ſaith) was faſtened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my neck, being wrapped in waxe, when I was found in the ſea, wherein I finde that my name is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis:</hi> and here-with all he ſhewed the letter to the Queene, which ſhe full well knew ſo ſoone as ſhe ſaw it. Beleeue me, ſaid the Queene, this truely is the Letter that <hi>Dario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta</hi> wrote, when ſhe made the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration betweene you and me: thus though I was ere while in great griefe and ſorrow, yet now (praiſed be God) I feele as much ioy and pleaſure. Now ſeeing aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly your name is <hi>Amadis,</hi> it is needleſſe you ſhould beare any other contrary title: ſo thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he was called no more the <hi>Gentleman of the ſea,</hi> but <hi>Amadis,</hi> and ſometime <hi>Amadis</hi> de <hi>Gaule.</hi> It was not long before the bruite
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7179:34"/>
hereof was ſpread through the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the good &amp; famous knight was ſonne to King <hi>Perion</hi> and the Queen <hi>Eliſena:</hi> wherefore if euery one reioyced (you muſt thinke) the Prince <hi>Agraies</hi> was not ſorry, for they were found to bee Cozin germaines. Among the reſt, the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge here-of, wherefore conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what comfort this would bee to the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> ſhe labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo much as ſhe could to return toward her: knowing ſhe would giue her friendly countenance, bringing her ſo good Newes, what gracious fortune had happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ue all other ſhe loued. For this cauſe ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated <hi>Amadis,</hi> to diſpatch her returne to her Miſtreſſe: In that I well perceiue, quoth ſhe, you can not ſo ſpeedily depart hence as you would, nor were it reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but you ſhould giue ſome contentation to them, who for the loue of you haue ſhedde ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teares. Theſe wordes cauſed the teares to trickle downe his cheekes, yet ſmothering his griefe ſo well as he could, he made this anſwere to the Damoſell. Lady, I will pray that the Heauens may ſafely conduct ye; yet let mee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat your friendly remembrance, commanding the vttermoſt of my endeauours, for without your gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care my life cannot endure: withall, I finde my ſelfe ſo endeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to my gracious Miſtreſſe, as I dare not requeſt any thing at her hand. Neuertheleſſe you may ſay to her, that right ſoon ſhall I come to ſhew my obedience, and in like Armor will I be clad, as when you ſaw me combate with the King of <hi>Ireland:</hi> becauſe both ſhe and you may the more eaſily know me, if I cannot compaſſe the meane to ſpeake with you; &amp; in this manner departed the Damoſel of <hi>Denmark.</hi> On the other ſide, <hi>Agraies</hi> ſeeing his Cozin <hi>Amadis</hi> was to remaine longer in <hi>Gaule,</hi> determined to take his leaue, and calling him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſayd. Faire Cozin, for this time I muſt be enforced to leaue ye, albeit your company is more pleaſing to me then any other: but my paſſionate heart will allow me no quiet, vntill I be with her, who both farre and neere hath power to command me. It is Madame <hi>Oliuia,</hi> daughter to the King <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nain</hi> of <hi>Norway,</hi> who ſent for me, (by the Damoſell that brought me the Helmet of <hi>Galpan,</hi> which you ſent me, in reuenge of the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhe receiued by him) that I ſhould come to her with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient ſpeed: and therefore I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may or dare faile, which is the onely cauſe of my parting with you.</p>
                  <p>Now muſt you note heere-with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that at the time as <hi>Don Galuanes</hi> brother to the king of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was in the Realme of <hi>Norway</hi> with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> his Cozin: this yong Prince became ſo enamoured of the Lady <hi>Olinia,</hi> as he concluded neuer to loue any other then her, and this made him the more earneſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by her commandement.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7179:35"/>
hence, to viſite the Court of king <hi>Laſuart,</hi> where I haue heard Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie to be worthily maintained, with greater libertie and honour, then in the kingdome of any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour or King. But ſeeing it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you to take another way, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire when you ſhall ſee the King your Father, and the Queene, to remember my bounden dutie to them both: aſſuring them (on my behalfe) that they may command mein their ſeruice, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as your ſelf, or any other, as well in reſpect of our alliance together, as alſo for the gracious entertainment I had in my youth, being by them moſt carefully educated and eſteemed. This done, <hi>Agraies</hi> took his leaue, beeing Honourably conducted through the Cittie, by the King and all the Lords of his Court: but ſo ſoone as the King entred the fields, he ſaw a Damoſell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming toward him, who boldly lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on the raine of his Horſe bridle, thus ſpake.</p>
                  <p>Remember thy ſelfe King <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> what a Damoſell ſome-time ſayd vnto thee: <hi>That when thou didſt recouer thy loſſe, the Kingdome of</hi> Ireland <hi>ſhould looſe her flower.</hi> Thinke now (I pray thee) whether ſhe ſayd true or no, thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered thy Sonne whom thou reputedſt loſt, and euen by the death of valiant King <hi>Abies,</hi> who was the Flower of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſuch a one as that Countrey ſhall neuer haue his like: <hi>Vntill time the good brother of the Ladie muſt come, who ſhall by force of Armes cauſe to be brought thither the tribute of other Countryes, and he muſt die by the hand of him, that ſhall accompliſh for her the onely thing of the world, which moſt he loueth.</hi> And ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Marlot</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> brother to the Queene of that Countrey: whom <hi>Triſtan</hi> of <hi>Leonnoys</hi> killed, on the quarrell of tribute deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of King <hi>Marke</hi> of <hi>Corne-wall</hi> his Vncle: which <hi>Triſtan</hi> after-ward dyed for the loue he bare to Queene <hi>Yſeul,</hi> being the onely thing of the world that hee moſt loued. Now muſt thou be minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hereof, ſayd the Damſel to the King, for <hi>Vrganda</hi> my Miſtreſſe ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth thee. When <hi>Amadis</hi> heard her ſpeake of <hi>Vrganda,</hi> he tooke occaſion thus to anſwere. Damoſell, and my friend, I pray you ſay to her who ſent you hither, that the Knight to whom ſhe gaue the Launce, commendeth him-ſelfe to her good grace: being now aſſured in the matter whereof then ſhe ſpake, how with that Launce, I ſhould deliuer the houſe from whence I firſt diſcended: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo it fell out, for I deliuered my Father vnknowne to me, being then at the very point of death, So without any other reply, the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell turning bridle rode backe the ſame way ſhe came, and the King into the Citie, with <hi>Amadis</hi> his Sonne ſo lately recouered: for which cauſe he aſſembled all the Princes and Lords of his Realme, meaning to keepe a more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Court then euer he had done before, to the end that euery one might behold <hi>Amadis,</hi> in regard of whoſe honour and happie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, there were Knightly Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys daily vſed, beſide great ſtore of other paſtimes and delights.</p>
                  <p>During theſe pleaſures, <hi>Amadis</hi> was aduertiſed in what manner the Gyant had carryed away his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Galaor,</hi> wherefore hee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined (happen what might) to goe ſeeke him, and if poſſible hee could to recouer him, either by force of Armes or otherwiſe. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, his heart being day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7179:35"/>
mooued to goe ſee her that hourely expected his preſence, one day he entreated the King his Father: ſeeing now he had peace with his enemies, that with his leaue he might goe ſeeke aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> becauſe he was loath to remaine idle. But lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pleaſing was this requeſt to the King, and much leſſe to the Queen, yet by opportunitie hee obtained permiſſion for his Voyage: nor could they all haue power to with hold him, by reaſon of the loue he bare to <hi>Oriana,</hi> which made him obedient to none but her. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, being clad in ſuch Armour, as he promiſed the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> he ſet forward on his iourney, embarqing himſelfe at the neereſt Port of the Sea, where by good happe he found paſſage readie. Not long was his cut into great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> landing at <hi>Briſtow,</hi> a moſt noble and auncient City of that Countrey, where hee heard that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> ſoiourned at <hi>Windſore,</hi> royally accompanyed with Knights and Gentlemen: for all the Kings &amp; Princes (his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours) did highly fauour and ſhew him obey ſance, which made <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> ſhape his courſe directly to the Court. Not long had he rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on the way but he met with a Damoſell, who demanded of him, if that were her readie way to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow?</hi> Yea marry is it (anſwered the Prince.) I pray ye then tell me, quoth ſhe, if I may finde any ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping there, for my ſpeedie paſſage ouer into <hi>Gaule?</hi> What affayres calles you thither? ſayd <hi>Amadis.</hi> In ſooth, replyed the Damoſell, I goe thither to finde a Knight na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Amadis,</hi> whom King <hi>Perion</hi> not long ſince had knowne to bee his Sonne. Greatly did <hi>Amadis</hi> meruaile hereat, for hee thought theſe newes had not been ſo farre ſpread abroad, wherefore hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded how ſhe heard thereof? I know it, qouth ſhe, from her, to whom the moſt ſecret things of all are manifeſt: for ſhe knew <hi>Amadis</hi> before he knew himſelfe, or that his Father heard of <hi>Amadis;</hi> and if you would vnderſtand what ſhee is, her name (by common report) is <hi>Vrganda the vnknowne.</hi> She hath at this time eſpeciall affayres with him, and by no other can ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer that, which ſhee now ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in feare to looſe. Beleeue me Damoſell, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe who may command euery one, doth now pleaſe to employ <hi>Amadis,</hi> I aſſure ye it is needleſſe for you to trauaile any further: for I am the man you are ſent to ſeek, and therefore let vs goe whither you thinke conuenient. What? ſayd the Damoſell, are you <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis?</hi> Yea, verily am I, anſwered the Prince. Come, then and follow me, quoth ſhe, and I will conduct yee where my Miſtreſſe is, who attendeth your arriuall in good deuotion. Heere-with <hi>Amadis</hi> rode after the Damoſell, and thus are they gone together in company.</p>

Notwith-ſtanding; before the Gyant moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this matter to him, one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other, <hi>Galaor</hi> came to him in this maner. Father, quoth he, you haue dayly promiſed me that I ſhould be Knighted, I deſire you would bee ſo good as your word: for there is too much time ſpent ſince I ought to haue had it. In ſooth my ſon (anſwerd the Gyant) you haue reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for your words: yet tell me by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you would receiue your Order? King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> is reputed a gentle Prince, and a right good Knight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ſo it like you, I ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to haue it at his hand. Wel haue you aduiſed, ſayd the Gyant: ſo preſently preparing all things in order, they ſet forward on their iourney. About fiue dayes after their departure by good hap they came neere a very faire and ſtrong Caſtle, named <hi>Bradoid,</hi> ſeated on the toppe of a mountaine, enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about with Fennes and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, as alſo with a ſalt water, that ran before it wondrous ſwiftly, ſo that without a Barque it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to get thither. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Mariſh was very long, there was to paſſe ouer it a faire long Cauſey, being ſo broad that two Chariots might well meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on it: and at the entrance of the Cauſey was a draw-bridge, where-under the water ran with ſuch a violent fall, as no one was able by any meanes to paſſe it. Heere muſt ye note, that equally facing this bridge, there grew two goodly Elme trees, where-under the Gyant and <hi>Galaor</hi> beheld two Damoſels and a Squire, with a knight mounted on a black Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, this Knight was armed, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring figured in his Shield, two Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons rampant: and becauſe the bridge was drawne vp, hee could paſſe no further, but called with a loude voyce to them within, that ſome ſhould come to giue him entrance, which <hi>Galaor</hi> perceiuing ſayd to the Gyant. My Lord (if it pleaſe you) I would grady ſee what this Knight will doe here. Soone after, they eſpyed at the further end of the Cauſey, by the Caſtle ſide, two other Armed Knights, accompanied with tenne Halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who came and demaunded of the knight, what he would? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie enter in, anſwered the Knight. It may not be, ſaid one of the two Knights, except you meane to combate firſt. I will not ſticke for that, anſwered hee that would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, cauſe you the bridge to bee let
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7179:36"/>
downe, and come to the combate: which preſently they did. But one of the twaine (more haſty then his companion) aduanced himſelfe firſt, and placing his Launce, ran with a ſwift carreer againſt the knight, who receiued him ſo braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he ſent both Horſe and man to the ground. The friend to the diſmounted knight thinking to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge his iniury, gaue forth to meete him, and failing in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint with their Launces, ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly encountered with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as the knight of the Caſtle fell into the water where he was drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the conquerour rode on, which the Halberders ſeeing, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently drew vp the bridge againe after him.</p>
                  <p>When the Damoſels ſaw he was thus cloſed in, they cryed out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud vnto him that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, &amp; as he was about ſo to do, he eſpied three other Knights well armed come toward him, who ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry audaciouſly thus ſpake. Vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py was the houre to thee whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou dideſt paſſe this bridge, for thou ſhalt dye in this water, where he is drowned that was of greater repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation then thou art. Here-with they all three together ran againſt him, and met him ſo firmely, as his Horſe was like to haue fallen ouer backward, yet hauing broken their Launces on him, he was at this encounter wounded in two places, neuertheleſſe, one of them he met in ſuch order, as his armour vnable to reſiſt the pointe of the Launce, pierced through with ſuch violence, that the trunchion ſtill remained in his body. This done, couragiouſly he drew his ſword, adreſſing himſelfe to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther twaine, and they in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner againſt him; where-upon began a dangerous Combate betweene them: but he with the Lions in his Shield doubting his death, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo much as he could to ouer-come his enemies, giuing one of them ſuch a ſtroke on the right arme, as (being cut from the body) it fell ſword and all to the ground: wherefore feeling himſelfe thus wounded, he galopped with all ſpeed to the Caſtell, crying. Helpe my friends, helpe your Lord who is in danger of killing. When the Knight of the Lions heard, that he with whom he muſt yet deale, was the Lord of the Caſtell: he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him ſuch a rigorous blow on the Helmet, as made him looſe his ſtirrops and ready to fall, had he not got hold about the neck of his Horſe: in this ſtaggering the Knight of the Lions rent his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met from his head, and he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing himſelfe vnarmed, thought to eſcape by flight as the other did, but his enemy got betweene him and the Caſtell, ſaying. Thou art dead, if thou yeeld not thy ſelfe my priſoner. Alas, anſwered the ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Knight, I am dead indeede if you pleaſe, but as you are a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman take pitty on me, for I doe yeeld my ſelfe your vanquiſhed. Suddenly the Knight of the Lions looking about, eſpied other Knights and armed men on foote, that came in great haſt from the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell to ſuccour their Lord: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſtepped to his conquered priſoner, and holding his ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his throate, ſaid. Command thy men to returne elſe ſhalt thou preſently die. Then he who ſaw his life in ſuch perill, cryed to them, &amp; made a ſigne with his hand, that if they loued him they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: where-upon, they behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Lords life at his enimies ſwords pointe, obeyed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with all poſſible ſpeed. Yet
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7179:37"/>
is not this enough, ſaid the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, cauſe now the bridge to be let downe: which he did, and they came both forth on the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey where the Ladyes taried: but when the Knight of the Caſtell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them, and that one of them was <hi>Vrganda the vnknowne:</hi> Ah my Lord, quoth he, if you keepe me not from this Lady, I am but dead. Nay beleeue me, anſwered the Knight, that will not I do, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther am to deale with thee as ſhee ſhall command me: then ſtepping to <hi>Vrganda,</hi> he ſaid. Madame, ſee here the Lord of the Caſtell, what is your pleaſure I ſhall do with him? Smi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e off his head, anſwered <hi>Vrganda,</hi> if he will not deliuer you my friend whom he keepeth in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Here-with he lift vp his ſword to feare him, when the Knight falling on his knee, cried. Ah my Lord, kill me not, I will obey whatſoeuer ſhe commandeth. Diſpatch it quickly then, ſaid the Knight of the Lions. So caled the Lord to one of the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berders within, ſaying. Go to my brother, and tell him if euer he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſee me aliue, let him quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe the impriſoned Knight to come hither, and the Damoſel that brought him with her. Right ſoone was the meſſenger gone on this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, returning immediatly with the Damoſell and the Knight, to whom the Knight of the Lions thus ſpake. Thanke this Lady who hath done ſo much for ye, and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great cauſe you haue to loue her, in that ſhe hath taken wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paines to deliuer you from this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hraldome. I do loue her, anſwered the reſtored Knight, and ſo will continue better then I haue done heretofore. But before he could fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh theſe words, <hi>Vrganda</hi> ran and embraced him, the like did he to her: afterward the conquerour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, what ſhould be done with her that brought him thither. It is neceſſary that ſhe dy, replied <hi>Vrga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> to let her know the price of ſo hainous an offence. Preſently was the poore Damoſel ſo ſtrangely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted, as ſhe ran skipping ouer the marriſh quag-mires, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning backe againe, would haue throwne her ſelfe into the water, had not the knight of the Lions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated <hi>Vrganda,</hi> to pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe for this time. Prouided, ſaide <hi>Vrganda,</hi> that ſhe returne no more to offend me, otherwiſe ſhe ſhall pay for altogether. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord of the Caſtle ſaw the Damoſell was remitted, at his requeſt who ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him, he thus ſpake. My Lord, I haue performed what hath bin commanded, therefore I pray ye giue me leaue to depart from her that neuer loued me. In ſooth, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Vrganda,</hi> for honor of him by whom you make your ſuite, I am content, and you may returne. He being gone, the Knight of the Lions (who yet maruailed, by what occaſion the Damoſell was driuen into that furie) asked what moued her ſo to do? Ah my Lord, quoth ſhe, me thought one came round about me, and would haue burned me with a lighted torch, therefore to ſaue my ſelfe, I ſought to leape into the water. At theſe words the Knight fell into a laughter, ſaying. Your folly hath beene ouer great, faire Damoſel, to worke her ill who knowes how to reuenge it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galaor</hi> ſtood and had ſeene all theſe things, where-upon he thus ſpake to the Giant Beleeue me fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I very much deſire that this worthy man ſhould giue me my order, for if King <hi>Liſuart</hi> be renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is for his poſſeſſions, but this Knight deſerues it by his ſtrength and valour. I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7179:37"/>
anſwered the Giant, go and requeſt it of him, if he deny you the fault is his owne. So <hi>Galaor</hi> went forward, accompanied with foure ſquires and two Damoſels, when comming to the Knight of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he found him yet vnder the trees. At his arriuall he was curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly receiued by the Knight, who reputed him one of the moſt come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gentlemen that euer he had ſeene, afterward <hi>Galaor</hi> thus began. Gentle Sir, I am come to entreat a fauour at your hand. Truely, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Knight, if your requeſt be reaſonable, it will the ſooner be granted. My ſuite Sir, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> is for nothing elſe, but that it might pleaſe you to giue me the order of knight-hood, and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you ſhall ſaue me a great deale of trauaile to king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> to whom I am going for the ſame cauſe. My friend, replied the knight, you ſhall do your ſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-much wrong, to leaue ſo good an occaſion by the beſt king in the world, for ſo poore a knight errand as I am. My Lord, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> the great ſtate of the king can put no ſuch ſtrenght into me, as I haue ſeene performed by you in the late Combats: therefore (ſo pleaſe it you) accompliſh in me my earneſt deſire. I can be much better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, anſwered the knight, to grant any other thing you will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: for ſuch authority apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not to me, nor to you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is it ſo honorable. As thus they ſtood on theſe tearmes, <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi> (vnlooked for) came to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where-with the knight of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was very glad: and ſhe hauing as yet not heard any of their talke, thus ſpake to her champion. What is your opinion of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman? Me thinks, quoth he, a brauer perſon was neuer ſeene: but he requireth ſuch a thing of me, as is neither in him or me conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. What is it? ſaid <hi>Vrganda.</hi> That I, quoth he, ſhould giue him the order of knight-hood, and yet he is now in trauaile, with deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to requeſt the ſame of the famous king <hi>Liſuart.</hi> Certainly, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Vrganda,</hi> to make him ſtay, will be a greater cauſe of euill to him then good, and I will councel him not to deſiſt from his former motion: for you ought nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him, ſeeing I can aſſure ye, that honor will be better imployed by him, then any other in all the Iſles of the ſea, except one. Seeing it is ſo, replied the knight, in the name of God let it be done: goe we then to ſome Church to performe the vigill. It ſhall be needleſſe, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> to ſtand about ſuch matters now, in that I come not vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them already. It ſuffiſeth then, anſwered the Knight: ſo put he on his right ſpurre, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him, ſaid. You are now a knight, wherefore take the honor of the ſword by whom you ſhall thinke it more conuenient. Do you then giue it me, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> if you pleaſe, for by no other will, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it with my will. Then he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Squire that held a ſword rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but <hi>Vrganda</hi> ſtepped before, ſaying. No, no, you ſhall haue a better: take that which hangeth on yonder tree, and you ſhall finde it farre more faire and good. Heere-with they looked vpon the tree, yet ſaw it not, wherefore they all began to ſmile, and ſhe doing the like, ſaid to them. In ſooth it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ten yeeres ſince it firſt was hanged there, yet no paſſenger by euer ſaw it: looke better about the tree, for ſure you cannot but eaſily behold it. Now did they all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it tied to a branch of the tree,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7179:38"/>
euen as though it had but euen then beene hanged there: and by it was a Scabberd couered with gold, ſhewing moſt fine and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worke-manſhip on it. The Knight of the Lyons tooke it downe, and afterward girded it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſaying. So faire a Sword beſeemeth a knight ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, and thinke ſhee hated you not, who of ſo long time hath kept it for you. Moſt cheerefully did <hi>Galaor</hi> giue her thankes, and the knight likewiſe, thus ſpeaking to them. I beſeech ye to hold me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, for I am conſtrained pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to depart from ye, and were it not I muſt goe where I am atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, no companie in the world would I deſire more then yours; therefore I deſire ye Sir, to tell me where I may find ye at my returne. In the Court of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the knight, where I ſhalbe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad to ſee you: and becauſe it is no long time ſince I was knighted, I am the more deſirous of ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode there to attaine honour, as you cannot chuſe but doe the like if you come hither. Certes, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> to that place will I ſhortly follow ye: and Madame, quoth he to <hi>Vrganda,</hi> you haue ſo ſtrictly bound me to your ſeruice, as may it pleaſe you to account me your knight, I am readie whereſoeuer you ſhall command mee. So de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted he from them, returning to the Gyant who ſtayed for him by the Riuer ſide, where hee had hid himſelfe, leaſt he ſhould bee ſeene.</p>
                  <p>But now you muſt here obſerue, that as <hi>Galaor</hi> thus deuiſed with <hi>Vrganda</hi> and the Knight, one of the Damoſels that was in <hi>Galaors</hi> company, had conference with her that attended on <hi>Vrganda,</hi> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at large ſhee vnderſtood, how the knight of the Lyons was <hi>Amadis,</hi> Son to king <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule:</hi> whoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thither <hi>Vrganda</hi> had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to deliuer by force of Armes her friend that there was kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, for by inchantme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhe could not compaſſe it, by reaſon the Ladie of the Caſtle was too cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in that Arte, and there had firſt enchanted him in deſpight of her, fearing no way to looſe him againe but by knightly chiualrie.</p>
                  <p>On this occaſion the cuſtome there was appointed, which <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> ended, and reſtored (as you haue heard) the man for whom they came thither: and hee by the Damoſell, Neece to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Caſtle, that in enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted furie would haue leapt into the Riuer, was conducted to this place.</p>
                  <p>So ſoone as <hi>Galaor</hi> had left <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda,</hi> ſhee demaunded of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> if he knew the man to whom hee) gaue the Order of Knight-hood. No, truely Madame, quoth he. In ſooth anſwered <hi>Vrganda,</hi> it is great reaſon you ſhould knowe what he is: for he beareth ſo braue a minde, that if you both ſhould meet without further knowledge, there might happen betweene yee great inconuenience. Therefore I giue ye to vnderſtand, how he is your owne brother both by father and mother, and the very ſame whom the Gyant caryed away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then but two yeeres old and a halfe: now he is of ſo goodly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as you haue ſeene, for whoſe ſake and yours likewiſe, I haue a long time kept the Sword, where-with (I aſſure ye) he ſhall do more in exploits of Armes, then euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knight did in Great <hi>Brittaine. Amadis</hi> concieued hereat ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ioy, as the teares trickled downe his cheekes, wherefore he ſaid to <hi>Vrganda.</hi> I beſeech ye Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7179:38"/>
tell mee where I may finde him. It is not neceſſarie, quoth ſhe, that as yet you ſhould ſeeke him. Why ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> is he then conſtrained to accompliſh ſome predeſtinate matter, before I may finde him? Yea verily, anſwered <hi>Vrganda,</hi> and it is not ſo eaſie to know as you may imagine. Long time thus continued their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, till <hi>Vrganda</hi> would depart alone with her friend: ſo ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <hi>Amadis</hi> to God, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently tooke his way toward <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore,</hi> where at this time King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> ſoiourned.</p>
                  <p>Our Hiſtorie (at this time) pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of him, continuing what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Galaor</hi> the new Knight, who beeing arriued where the Gyant ſtayed for him, thus ſpake. Father, I am now thanks bee to God, and him you ſent me to, a confirmed knight. My ſonne, quoth the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, I am not a little glad thereof: and ſeeing it is ſo well effected, will yee graunt mee one requeſt? What? ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> am I to denie you any thing, except you would with-hold mee from ſeeking ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor? My ſonne, anſwered the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, I rather deſire thy happy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding therein, and that which I would haue appertaineth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Demand then what you will, ſaid <hi>Galaor</hi> for I graunt it. Faire Sonne, quoth the Gyant, hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you haue heard mee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the Gyant <hi>Albadan,</hi> who by treaſon ſlewe my Father, and yet forcibly detaineth from me the Rocke of <hi>Galteres,</hi> which iuſtly doth belong to me: I pray ye to take reuenge on my behalfe, for no other then you may doe it: remember how well I haue nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and vſed you, as alſo my true and vnfained loue, which is ſuch, as I will yeeld my perſon euen to the death for ſafetie of yours. This matter ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> you need not requeſt, but command me to doe it: as for my ſelfe, I deſire you to reſt content, till with <hi>Albadan</hi> I haue tryed this difference, ſeeing it concerneth you ſo neere. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, heereof you may bee perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if I eſcape with life, I ſhall continue euermore in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to accompliſh any thing elſe for your honour and profit: in which deuoire, the whole circuit of my time is bound, as witneſſe of the dutie I owe to you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without any longer trifling, let vs ſet forward to him with whom I muſt try my fortune. So tooke they the way to the rocke of <hi>Galteres,</hi> but before they had trauailed farre, <hi>Vrganda</hi> ouer-tooke them, and being acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with each other, ſhe ſaid to <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor.</hi> Know yee (gentle Sir) who hath this day made you Knight? That doe I Madame, anſwered <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor,</hi> euen the beſt knight that euer I heard of. It is very true (quoth ſhe) yet is hee of greater eſteeme then you thinke, but I would haue you to know his name: then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſhe <hi>Gandalaz</hi> the Gyant, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Gandalaz,</hi> doeſt not thou know that this knight (whom thou haſt nouriſhed) is the Sonne to king <hi>Perion,</hi> and his Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſena,</hi> and how by ſuch like wordes I bad thee take him, ſince which time thou haſt beene his Foſter father? It is very true, anſwered the Gyant. Now then <hi>Galaor,</hi> my friend, ſaid <hi>Vrganda,</hi> the man that made thee knight is thy brother and elder then thou by two yeers: wherefore when thou ſeeſt him, giue him honour, and labour to reſemble him in hardineſſe and kindſhip. May it be poſſible? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Galaor,</hi> that King <hi>Perion</hi> is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7179:39"/>
my Father, and Queene <hi>Eliſena</hi> my mother, and I the brother to ſo good a knight? Doubt not thereof (quoth ſhee) for it is ſo. Praiſed be God, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> now may I aſſureye, that I am in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before: nor wil I make any ſpare of my life, ſeeing it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary I ſhould reſemble him you talke of. Thus returned <hi>Vrganda</hi> the ſame way ſhee came, and the Gyant with <hi>Galaor</hi> rode on as they purpoſed, the Prince demanding of the Gyant, what the Lady was that had communed with them? It is quoth hee, <hi>Vrganda the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,</hi> as ſhe nameth her ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe often tranſ-formeth and maketh her ſelfe vnknowne. As thus they deuiſed together, they came to a Riuers ſide where they would refreſh themſelues, and by reaſon the heate of the day was very vehement, they cauſed a Tent to bee erected: where long they had not ſitten, but they beheld two Damoſels comming toward them by two ſeuerall wayes, and met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether directly before the Pauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. So ſoone as they eſpied the Gyant, they would haue fledde, but <hi>Galaor</hi> came to aſſure them, and curteouſly cauſed them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, demanding afterward whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they trauailed. I goe (quoth one of them) by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Miſtreſſe, to ſee a ſtrange fight, which one onely Knight hath enterpriſed in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, againſt the ſtrong Gyant at the Rocke of <hi>Galteres,</hi> to the ende I may bring her true tidings there-of. When the other Damoſell heard her ſay ſo, ſhe thus replyed. I am amazed at your ſpeeches, is there any knight in the word dare venter on ſuch follie? Certes, ſaid the firſt, it is moſt true. Beleeue me, anſwered the other, although my occaſions be elſe-where, I am content to ſtay and goe with you, to ſee a matter ſo incredible. Hereupon they would haue taken leaue of <hi>Galaor,</hi> but hee ſaid to them. Make no haſt faire Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, but tarrie if you pleaſe, and we wil beare ye companie: where-to they condiſcended, as well for the good grace they noted in this new Knight, as alſo in reſpect of his amiable countenance, which made them take great pleaſure in beholding him: then <hi>Galaor</hi> wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the Giant aſide, ſaid, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I could wiſh that you would goe no further with vs, but let me goe with theſe Damoſels to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh what I haue promiſed: this hee ſpake becauſe hee would not be knowne what hee was, or that his enterpriſe ſhould bee ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by them, whereto the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant (vnwillingly) did accord. So rode <hi>Galaor</hi> with the Damoſels, and three Squires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Giant left him to beare his Armour, making ſuch ſpeede in their iourney, that they arriued within two Miles of the Rocke of <hi>Galteres,</hi> where they lodged in the little Cottage of an Hermite, to whom <hi>Galaor</hi> impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome of his ſecret thoughts: but when hee reuealed that hee came for the Combate, the good Hermit (abaſhed thereat) diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him in this manner.</p>
                  <p>My Sonne, who hath aduiſed thee to this boldnes, ſeeing there is not in all this Countrey ten ſuch Knights, as dare aſſaile the Gyant, ſo fearefull and monſtrous is he to behold: and you being but yong, to hazard your ſelfe in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, aduenture the loſſe both of bodie and ſoule, becauſe ſuch as wilfully ſeeke their owne death, are very homicides of themſelues. Father, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> God
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7179:39"/>
worke his will with mee, for by no meanes may I let paſſe mine enterpriſe. Greatly was the good man mooued to compaſſion, ſo that the teares be deawed his milke-white beard, beeing able to make no other anſwere, but thus: If not my Sonne, I deſire God to aſſiſt yee, ſeeing you will giue no better credite to me. Good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> be mindfull of mee in your deuout Prayers: and thus till next morning they ſpent the night.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galaor</hi> hauing armed himſelfe, went to the Rocke which was not farre from the Hermitage, for there might be eaſily diſcerned the Fortreſſe &amp; great Towers, which deliuered good marke of a moſt ſtrong Caſtle. When one of the Damoſels ſaw they approched ſo neere, ſhe demaunded of <hi>Galaor,</hi> if he knew the Knight that ſhould performe the Combate? I thinke (quoth he) I haue ſeene him ſome-time: but tell me (I pray yee) from what place are you come to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this paſtime? And what is the Lady that ſent you? None muſt know ſo much, ſayd the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, but the Knight him-ſelfe which dealeth in the Combate. Thus continued their talke, till they arriued at the Caſtle of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badan,</hi> the gate wherof they found faſt ſhut, but <hi>Galaor</hi> ſtepping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to called the Porter: at which noiſe, two menſhewed themſelues ouer the Porch, demaunding of him what he would haue. Goe, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> and ſay to <hi>Albadan,</hi> that heere is a Knight, who is ſent from <hi>Gandalaz</hi> to defie him: and if he come not out the ſooner, he will ſhew himſelfe of leſſe valour then reputation. You haue reaſon (ſayd one of them in mockage) but he will quickly bring a remedie for your chollor, if you doe not helpe it your ſelfe by running away. So departed the Watch-men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Gyant of theſe Newes, and when the Damoſels vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that <hi>Galaor</hi> him-ſelfe muſt execute the enterpriſe, being ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with amazement, they ſayd. Ah my Lord, you attempt a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ouer-much folly, would God you might ſpeed ſo well, as with honor to accompliſh an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe of ſuch conſequence: As for me (quoth one of them) I dare tarrie no longer with ye, for I ſhall die at the ſight of the Monſter with whom you haue to deale.</p>
                  <p>Damoſels, ſayd hee, ſeeing you may not be aſſured heere, depart I pray ye to the Hermitage, where we lodged this laſt night, and if I dye not in fight, I will not be long from ye. Beleeue me, replyed the other Damoſell, what-ſoeuer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen I will not goe, for I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to ſee the ende.</p>
                  <p>The boldneſſe of the one made them both tarrie, yet did they ſunder themſelues by the Forreſt ſide, becauſe the Gyant ſhould not ſee them, and hoping the better to eſcape away if the Knight ſped not well.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Oone was the Giant aduertiſed of theſe newes, wherefore not long after he came forth of the Caſtell, mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted on a horſe proportionable to ſuch a huge body: for it ſeemed an elephant, &amp; he on his back made ample reſemblance of a huge <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſus,</hi> or like a mountaine mouing, rather then a man. Armed he was in plates of iron ſo long, as from his throate they couered all the ſaddle on the horſe, hauing on his head a bright ſhining Helmet, and in his hand a mighty iron Mace, being the weapon where-with hee commonly vſed to fight. Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully affraide were the Squires and the Ladies that beheld him, and <hi>Galaor</hi> was not ſo aſſured, but hee ſtood ſome-what abaſhed: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he reſolued ſo cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly, as the neerer he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, the leſſe account he made of his huge enemies Mace. When the Giant ſaw him come marching ſo brauely toward him, he ſaid. I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile demie man, how thou dareſt with ſuch boldneſſe tarry thy death: he that ſent thee hither might either borow thy courage, or thou his corpulence, but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended I ſhould breake my faſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the houre of dinner came. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> ſomewhat diſcontented with theſe deſpiſings, thus anſwered. Thinkeſt thou huge beaſt that thy barking can aduantage thee, or hinder me? my confidence is in him who abated the pride of the great Philiſtine, and can likewiſe deliuer thee more baſe and vile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the duſt. Exceeding angry was the Giant at theſe words, wherefore without any more talke, he lifted vp his Mace to ſtrike, ſeeming in his marching as though a Tower had beene caried about, but <hi>Galaor</hi> being prompt &amp; nimble, ſtooped his Launce, and with a rough ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere of his horſe, attainted him on the ſtomacke ſo brauely, as he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the mighty <hi>Poliphemus</hi> forgoe one of his ſtirrops, his Launce therewith ſhiuering in pieces in the aire. At this encounter the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant thought to haue ſtroken him downe with his Mace, but he was too roughly and ſuddenly ſtaied, whereby his blow was giuen in vaine: for the Mace which was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, and comparable to a huge beame in bignes, being deliuered with ful force of both his armes: fel downe ſo weightily, as the Giant himſelfe was not able to hold it, whereby it lighted on the head of his owne horſe ſo peazantly, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feld there-with, dyed preſantly vnder him, the Giant tarying a good while before he could reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himſelfe againe. Yet the horſe being of courage, did ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtriue to get vp, but <hi>Galaor</hi> thruſting his ſword into his belly, cauſed him at length to lie there ſtill enough: but in the end, the Giant did the like to <hi>Galaors</hi> horſe, and he ſeeing in what great danger now he was, by his wonted dexterity quickly got footing. Then approching his enemy, drew the ſword <hi>Vrganda</hi> had giuen him, wherewith wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching when the Giant lifted his Mace, he gaue ſuch a ſtroke at it where he held his hands, as brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſtoke in pieces, he left but
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7179:40"/>
little length for the Giant to holde it by: yet he made ſhift to buffet <hi>Galaor</hi> there-with in ſuch ſorte, as he was conſtrained to ſet one hand to the ground to ſuſtaine himſelfe. But all this did no iot aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him, for comming to the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, (who yet kept play with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of his Mace, which by wary eſcapes the Prince ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented) he gaue a ſtroke at him with ſo full force, as cleane cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the left arme from his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the ſword paſſing further with like ſtrength, met the Giants leg ſo directly, that it wounded him through the fleſh, with a wide gaping wound to the very bone. Feeling great paine by both theſe maimes, he cried out aloud: Ah vnhappy wretch that I am, to be thus ouercome by the ſtrength of one man. Being in extreame rage, he ſought to faſten hold on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Galaor,</hi> but the ſore wound on his leg would let him ſtand no longer, conſtraining him to fall on his knees to the ground: &amp; as the Prince aproch't to him, he thought with his other arme to pull him down, but <hi>Galaor</hi> perceiuing his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſtroke at him againe &amp; ſmot off his hand. Now was the Giant deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiled of all force, being ſo woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ouer-trauailed withal, that he was no longer able to endure: by which meanes <hi>Galaor</hi> more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parted his head fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſholders, which he deliuered his Squires to cary with him. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Damoſels beheld this famous conqueſt, they left their ambuſh, &amp; came to regard this maruaile, ſaying to <hi>Galaor.</hi> In ſooth worthy Knight, great good nar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As they were about to rerurne, they ſaw ten Knights come forth of the caſtle chained together, who cried to him.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7179:41"/>
wherefore he thus ſpake. My ſon, daily are you bound to praiſe the diuine bounty, whoſe loue hath giuen you grace to execute this notable vengeance. On the morrow, after he had receiued the good mans benediction, he ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on hias way, &amp; one of the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels intreted him, that he would ſuffer her to trauaile in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, whereto right willingly he gaue conſent. And I, quoth the other, muſt take another way, in that I had not come thus farre, but onely to behold the iſſue of the combat, which I haue ſeene with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as I muſt needs make co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable reporte thereof to other, &amp; ſo ſhall I not faile to do in the Court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> whether now I go to finde a brother of mine gone thether before me.

So tooke the Damoſell her leaue of <hi>Galaor,</hi> who afterward thus began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with the other.

That ſhall not let me, ſaid <hi>Galaor:</hi> thus rode they on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo long, till at length they came to a forked way, and <hi>Galaor</hi> who rid muzing before, thought ſhe had followed him: but ſhe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted behind alittle, and when ſhe hoped to ouer-take him againe, it was her hap to take the wrong way. This chanced at the entrance of the Forreſt of <hi>Braganda,</hi> which ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Countries of <hi>Claire</hi> and <hi>Greſca,</hi> where long he had not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ah good Knight, help me. <hi>Galaor</hi> turning his head to ſee what was the cauſe: I thinke, quoth one of his Squires, it ſhould be the Damoſell that departed from vs. What? ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> hath ſhe left vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea truely, anſwered the Squire, ſhe tooke the way leading on the left hand. Beleeue me, quoth he, I had very little care of her, &amp; haſtly without taking his Helmer, hauing only his Shield and Lance, he galopped ſo faſt as he could to the place where he heard the voice, and hard at hand he eſpied fiue men on foote, armed with Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and Halberds, and a Dwarffe on horſe-back, who cruelly laied on the Damoſell with a ſtaffe. When <hi>Galaor</hi> approched neere them, hee came to the Dwarffe, ſaiyng. Thou villainous and deformed creature, ſoone ſhall I ſend thy ſoule to the Diuell: and running fiercely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him with his Launce, threw him againſt the ground maruail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly amazed. Then came the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eagerly vppon him, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him on euery ſide: but to the firſt he gaue ſuch a grieting with his Launce, as he lay ſprangling on the earth. Another of them buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led cloſe to him, laying load on his Shield with his Halberd, but at length he pierced his Lance quite through his body. When the other three ſaw this maſſacre, they ranne away ſo faſt as they could ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart the Forreſt, and <hi>Galaor</hi> not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7179:41"/>
able to ouertake them, returned backe againe to the Dwarffe, who being gotten on horſe-back, fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way after the other, crying. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed Knight, in hapleſſe houre haſt thou miſuſed my men, for thou ſhalt dy an euill death. <hi>Galaor</hi> ſeeing the Dwarffe laboured ſo hard as he could to ſaue himſelfe, would follow him no further, but went to ſee if his Launce were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken, which he had left in the body of the dead man: and finding it ſound as it was before, gaue it to his Squire, ſaying to the Damoſell. Ride now before me, and I will guard you better then I haue done.</p>
                  <p>So tooke they the way againe they had left, that brought them to a Riuer named <hi>Braz,</hi> which could not be paſſed at the foord: now rode the Damoſell ſomewhat farre bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>Galaor,</hi> finding the paſſage ſo ready, as ſhe went ouer before he came. In meane while he ſtaied the returne of the boate, he eſpied the Dwarffe come after him cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Villainous traitour thou art dead, if thou deliuer not the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell thou tookeſt from me. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle account did <hi>Galaor</hi> make of his words, but looking backe, he ſaw three Knights come after the Dwarffe well mounted, one of the three thus ſpeaking to the reſt. It were great diſhonor for vs, to ſet all three together vpon one man: and as for my ſelfe, I thinke ſcorne to be aſſiſted by any. Hauing ſo ſaid, with a full courſe he ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prince, who likewiſe was ready to entertaine him, and they encountred in ſuch ſorte, as the Knight pierced <hi>Galaors</hi> Armour, making him feele the naked pointe of his Launce: but <hi>Galaor</hi> bad him ſo brauely welcome, caſting him from his ſaddle with ſuch might, as he lay on the ground not able to ſtirre, whereat the other twaine were ſo abaſhed, that they ranne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prince, the one failing, and the other breaking his Lance: which <hi>Galaor</hi> determining to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, ſtroke his Launce into the ſight of the laſt Knights Helmet, as he made it fall from his head, and he (hauing loſt his ſtirrops) ready to lye along. Meane while, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond who had not broken, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt <hi>Galaor,</hi> &amp; ſped in mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Now albeit the encounter was with great vigour, yet eſcaped the armour on either ſide. Hauing thus galantly ſhiuered their ſtaues, they drew forth their ſwords, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning a fierce and cruell combat, and while the fight endured, the Dwarffe without ceaſing cryed to his men. Looke well that he eſcape not, but kill him leaſt he get away. Then <hi>Galaor</hi> comming neere him who had loſt his Helmet, reached him ſuch a ſtroke on the head, as he tumbled downe dead before him. And when the third ſaw his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion ſlaine, being affraid of him-ſelfe, he turned his back and away: but <hi>Galaor</hi> purſued him ſo neere, that he gaue him a blow betweene the neck and the ſhoulders, which brought off a great many plats of his Armour. Now did the run-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies feare more &amp; more encreaſe, when he felt his enemy ſo neere at hand, wherefore the better to ſaue himſelfe, he caſt his ſhield back o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his ſhoulders, &amp; fled away faſter then he did before: which <hi>Galaor</hi> perceiuing, would follow him no longer, but haſtily returned, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to take the Dwarffe and binde his legs to a tree, from which the Dwarffe kept himſelfe wel enough, for he had gotten more ground in running away then the other. Here-upon he came to the firſt that he diſmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, who hauing ſome-what
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7179:42"/>
recouered himſelfe, <hi>Galaor</hi> thus ſpake to him. Inſooth your misfortune grieueth mee more then your fellowes doth, for like a good Knight you came alone to me, albeit I know not on what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, in reſpect I neuer offended ye as I remember. It is very true, anſwered the Knight, notwith-ſtanding you muſt note what the Dwarffe ſayd to vs: how you had beaten him, ſlaine his men, and taken a Lady perforce from him, that was in his companie.</p>
                  <p>Beleeue me, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the Damoſell on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the Riuer) he falſly ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were it that I had brought her away perforce, ſhe would not carry for me, ſo willingly as ſhee doth: but ſhe vnhappily ſtraying in this Forreſt, the Dwraffe met with her, offering to leade her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way againſt her will, and becauſe ſhe would not obey him, he gaue her many cruel ſtrokes with a ſtaff. Ah, Traitour that he is, anſwered the knight, for this villainie ſhall I reward him if euer wee meete a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

At her returne, they mounted on horſe-backe, and rode together croſſe the Forreſt, which when they left, the night ouer-tooke them: whereupon the Damoſell forſaking the out-right way, turned aſide, and by time the greater part of the night was ſpent, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

With much adoe he aſcended the wall, by reaſon of his weightie Armor, as alſo beeing troubled with his Shield and Helmet. When the Damoſell ſaw hee was amounted, ſhee entred the Pallace to guide him as ſhe begun: in meane while <hi>Galaor</hi> was diſcended, and ſate hard by a Poſterne that entred a Garden, where he tarryed ſo long, till the Damoſell came and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the doore with one of her companions, but ere hee entred,

Let that alone anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> for I haue ſuch a Father, as til the time of better happe, I am content not to name him. Neuertheleſſe, quoth one of them, it is very neceſſarie we ſhould know, for it ſhall not be any way to your hinderance. I am (anſwered <hi>Galaor)</hi> Sonne to King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and the Queene <hi>Eliſena,</hi> and it is not ſixe dayes paſt ſince I could not tell yee ſo much. Stay then, ſaid the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: ſo they cauſed him to be vn-armed, caſting a Mantle about his ſhoulders; and afterward went on, the firſt Damoſell going before, and the other comming behinde him. In this manner they entred the Pallace, paſſing through a chamber, where many Ladies and Gentlewomen were in bed: and if any one demaunded who went by ſo late, the Damoſels (his guides) made anſwere for him. Thus not perceiued by any, they came to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Chamber, wherein when <hi>Galaor</hi> entred, he ſaw ſitting on a gorgious bedde a moſt beautifull Ladie, with an Iuory combe kem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing her faire locks: but when ſhe eſpied <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſhe pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

My Friend, you are right heartily welcome, being the beſt knight in the word that I know. And you, Madame, quoth he, are moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily found, being the faireſt Ladie that euer I ſaw. Then the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell that had guided him thither, thus ſpake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Lord, ſee here my Miſtreſſe, how am I diſcharged of the promiſe I made ye, and if you would haue me ſay any more: ſhe is named <hi>Aldena,</hi> daughter to king <hi>Serolys,</hi> and becauſe the wife to the Duke of <hi>Briſtoya,</hi> is ſiſter to her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhe nouriſheth her here, as her owne daughter.

Here-with ſhe went preſently foorth of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and making faſt the doore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her, left the two loues alone: by which meanes they ſpent this night ſo amorouſly, as they that haue taſted like fortune may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But the houre being come when <hi>Galaor</hi> ſhould depart, he was wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aduiſed thereof by the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, who brought him to the place were ouer-night hee had left his Armour: and after hee was inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted therein (as hee ought to be) he went along the Garden againe where-through he came in. And as neuer any good chanceth, with-out ſome miſhap attending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo nowe came it to paſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for there found he the Dwarffe ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, that had ſo miſuſed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as you haue heard, who no ſooner eſpied him, but hee cryed out. Beleeue me, Sir Royſter, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe waſt thou to enter heere, for thou dyeſt, and the traitereſſe that did conduct thee. Come foorth Knights, come foorth, here is a man that ſecretly came out of the Dukes Chamber. It was no time then for <hi>Galaor</hi> to ſleepe, but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly getting vp the wall, caſt him-ſelfe on the other ſide, where fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his horſe readie, he preſently mounted: notwithſtanding, the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7179:43"/>
Dwarffe and the reſt (well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſecret iſſues of the Caſtle) with all ſpeed purſued him, and perceiuing how this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous Dwarffe was cauſe of all this trouble, ſtayed, ſaying to him-ſelfe. Either I will die, or bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged on this rediculous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if I catch him. Then came the other and ſet vpon him, but ſo brauely did he defend himſelfe, as none of them durſt be bold to tary neere him: for he being mooued to exceeding impatience, thruſt himſelfe in the midſt among them, laying about with courage, as well they found who they dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. <hi>Galaor</hi> ſeeing the Dwarffe ſtill kept aloofe, determining to die, but he would lay hold on him, and entring among the thickeſt of them, before his Launce brake he ſlew two out-right: then drawing his Sword, made them ſo ſoundly acquainted with the ſharpe edge thereof, as he that thought him-ſelfe hardyeſt, was glad to giue him way, for no one medled with him but was layd along. At length they compaſſed him in ſuch ſort, as they found meanes to kill his horſe, which made him fall to the ground in very great danger, for now they verily intended to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him, and the Dwarffe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe that hee could not eſcape, came neere to ſhew ſome part of his man-hood: but when he ſaw <hi>Galaor</hi> had in ſpight of them recouered his feet, and happy was he which kept furtheſt from him, hee turned his horſe to eſcape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, yet by chaunce <hi>Galaor</hi> got hold on the reines of his bridle, giuing him ſuch a blowe on the ſtomacke with the hilts of his Sword, that he fell to the ground ſo loutiſhly, as the blood guſhed foorth at all the conduits of his head. Then lightly mounted hee on the Dwarffes horſe, and the Beaſt ſeeming to ſtorme at this change, from an euill-fauoured Dwarffe to one of the beſt knights in the world, made proofe whether his Rider could ſit faſt, or no, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning violently with him a good diſtance from his enemies. And turning to make an ende of his worke, as by chaunce he lifted his eyes to the Caſtle, he ſaw in one of the windowes the Ladie whom he had choſen as his friend, ſhee ſhaking a white hand-kercher to him, meaning he ſhould be gone with all poſſible ſpeed, which hee did, becauſe thee perceiued more enemies at hand. With nimble pace he hyed him away, not tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till hee recouered the Forreſt, where to refreſh himſelfe a while, he gaue his Helmet to his Squire.</p>
                  <p>Now ſhall ye vnderſtand, how when the Dukes Knights ſaw him make ſuch haſte away, ſome were of the opinion to follow him, the reſt ſaid it was in vaine, ſeeing hee had gotten into the wood, &amp; thus debating, they went no further, but ſtood as men confounded, with maruailing howe one man could be able to vanquiſh ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Meane while the Dwarffe was come to himſelfe againe, but hee felt his body ſo ſore and bruiſed, as very hardly could he ſtand on his feet, yet ſtill he cryed to them in this manner.</p>
                  <p>My friends, cary me to my Lord the Duke, for I will let him know what hee muſt needes reuenge. Through theſe importunate accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, he was brought by them before the Duke, to whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, how he met the Damoſell in the Forreſt, &amp; becauſe he would haue accompany her home, ſhee cryed out till a Knight came to aid

Here-upon all the Ladyes, and Gentle-women were ſent for, and ſo ſoone as the Dwarffe beheld her he ſayd. This is ſhee (my Lord) by whom your Pallace is diſhonoured.

                     <hi>Amadis</hi> then ſomewhat diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the outragious ſpeeches of <hi>Dardan,</hi> departed, not ſo much caring for his lodging, as how to be reuenged: &amp; concluded, ſome-time in walking obout, and other while in reſting by a buſh, to paſſe the incommodity of this night in the Forreſt, thus to beguile the time till day riſing. As there hee traced vp and downe, he heard the ſpeech of ſome body nere him, and looking about, eſpied two Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels on horſe-back accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Squire: after they had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him, and he them, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded from whence he came ſo late armed, wherewith <hi>Amadis</hi> throughly reported, all that had happened to him at the Caſtell. Know you, ſaid the Damoſels, the name of the Knight? That doe I, quoth he, for he tolde me his name is <hi>Dardan.</hi> Very true, ſaid they, hee is called <hi>Dardan the proud,</hi> the moſt audatious Knight in this country. I beleeue it well, anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> Sir Knight, quoth they, ſeeing you are ſo vnprouided of lodging, if you will take patience to remaine this night in our tentes, which are pitched heere hard at hand, you ſhall be welcome. He glad of this courteſie, rode with them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there alighted, <hi>Amadis</hi> cauſed his Squire to vnarme him. When the Damoſels ſaw him ſo faire, and of ſuch honeſt conuerſation, they were well pleaſed with his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: and ſo they ſupped together merily, afterward they gaue him a pallad to reſt vpon. Neuertheleſſe, before they parted, they demanded of him whether he trauailed. To the Court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis.</hi> And ſo do we replied the Damoſels, to ſee what ſhall happen to a Lady, one of the beſt and moſt noble in the Country, who hath committed her welfar to the triall of a Combate, and it muſt be within few dayes following bee performed before King <hi>Liſuert</hi> but yet wee know not who will be the man, for he againſt whom the cauſe muſt be defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, is one of the beſt Knights in all great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> What is, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> the Knight ſo much eſteemed, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many good? It is the ſame <hi>Dardan,</hi> anſwered the Damoſels, from whome ſo lately you came. And on what cauſe, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> ariſeth the Combate? I pray ye (faire Ladyes) if you know, let mee vnderſtand it, Sir, quoth one of them, this <hi>Dardan</hi> loueth a Knights daughter of the Country, who at his ſecond nuptials maried her I am to ſpeake of: now hath this Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell the beloued of <hi>Dardan,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſuch hatred againſt her faire mother, that ſhe hath ſaid to her friend, how ſhe will neuer loue him, except he bring her to King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, and there openly maintaine, that all the poore La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes goods appertaineth to her, and if any gain-ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, he to iuſtifie the ſame in Combate. Theſe news were highly pleaſing to <hi>Amadis,</hi> for by theſe meanes he intended to compaſſe occaſion, to be reuenged of the wrong he did him: and that in the preſence of <hi>Griana,</hi> who ſhould there perceiue what her
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7179:45"/>
Knight was, which made him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into ſuch thoughts, as the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels well noting it, one of them thus ſpake. I pray ye Sir, for cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, acquaint vs with the reaſon of your ſudden muſing, if it may without offence be knowne. Faire Ladies, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> if you will promiſe me as loyall Gentle-women, to keepe it ſecret and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale it to no one, willingly ſhall I tell ye: all which they ſolemnely ſware to performe. I intend (quoth he) to combate for the Dame you ſpake of, and minde not to faile: but I would haue it concealed from any but your ſelues. When they heard what he ſayd, they were much abaſhed, notwithſtanding they made great eſteeme of him: ſeeing what they had vttered in praiſe of <hi>Dardan,</hi> could not affray him, but hee would hazard the Combate, and therefore ſhee that alreadie had broken the matter, thus replyed. Gentle Sir, your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a high reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued minde, and wee will pray for your proſperons ſucceſſe. So gaue they ech to other the good night, and went to reſt till the morning, when they diſlodged together. Then entreated the Damoſels, that ſeeing hee went to the ſame place they did, and in the Forreſt kept men of euill behauiour: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee would not forſake their company, whereof he made them promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Along they ride with ſundrie diſcourſings, where among other talke, they deſired, in reſpect they met ſo happily together, that he would bee content to let them know his name. My name, quoth he is <hi>Amadis,</hi> but I pray you keepe it onely to your ſelues. Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on by vaſte and vnfrequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted places, one day, when furtheſt they were from doubt, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held before them vnder a tree, two Armed Knights prepared for the Iouſt: who ſeeing them comming, ſtepped into the midſt of the way, the one ſaying to his companion. Which of theſe two Damoſels wouldeſt thou haue, and the other I meane to take my ſelfe? I will ſaid (the other) haue the firſt. And I her companion, anſwered the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo without more words they came to lay hands on them. <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> who miſliked ſuch dealing, without the Damoſels conſent, addreſſed himſelfe to the Knights: demaunding what manner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour this was, to Ladyes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from honeſt place? Such, quoth they, as beſeemeth women of their age. What anſwered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> would you then force them? Who ſhall let vs (quoth they) if wee pleaſe? Marie, that will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Amadis:</hi> then lacing his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, he tooke his ſhield &amp; Lance, ſaying. Let the Damoſels alone you ſhameleſſe men, and defend your ſelues. Without any more talke they gaue their ſpurres to their Horſes, meeting together with ſuch puiſſance, as the Knight brake his Launce, and <hi>Amadis</hi> gaue him ſuch an attaint, that hee carryed him from his horſe to the ground, with his head vnder, and his heeles vpward: breaking the laces of his Helmet in the fall, ſo that his head remained without ſhelter.</p>
                  <p>When the other ſaw his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion downe, he would reuenge him, and couching his Launce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Amadis,</hi> met him ſo full, as piercing his Armour, wounded him a little, and his ſtaffe was ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered all in pieces: but the Prince failing with his Launce, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred him ſo fiercely with his body
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7179:45"/>
and Horſe, as he lay tumbling hard by his fellow, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comming to the Damoſels, he ſaid. I pray ye heere-after come no more behinde, but for your better ſurety keepe ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. A while he taried to ſee if they would riſe againe, but perceiuing they made no ſhew thereof, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare to charge them any further, &amp; ſo rode on with his company. Soone after they came to a faire plaine, whereby a pleaſant Riuer had his courſe, and there they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Tents to be erected: as well to regard the hurt of <hi>Amadis,</hi> as alſo to refreſh themſelues. But as they ſate at meat, the two diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Knights came riding thither, ſaying to <hi>Amadis.</hi> Sir Knight, you haue won the Ladies at the Lance, now muſt ye defend them by the ſword, otherwiſe we will cary them hence in deſpite of you. But you ſhall not, quoth he, if I can let it: ſo drawing his ſword againſt him that firſt made offer, in ſhort time he brought him into ſuch diſtreſſe, as without the ſuccour of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, he was vnable to hold out any longer: which <hi>Amadis</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, ſaid. Ah Knight, the Ladyes make ſlender account of you, that you muſt come both vpon one man. Yet notwithſtanding he wold not forbare, but as the patterne of vnconquerable valour, gaue him likewiſe worke enough to doe, ſo that all their wrong turned to his honor: for he gaue the laſt ſuch ſtrokes on the helmet, as the ſword glaunſing on his ſhoulders, cut in twaine the cuyrates of his armour, &amp; ſliced his fleſh to the very bone, which made him let fall his ſword, and run away halfe dead. Then tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the other, he cut off his hand vnder his Shield, the paine whereof was ſo yrkeſome to him, as he cryed. Ah I am ſlaine. Thus ſpeaking, he threw his ſword to the ground, and the Shield from about his neck. All this auaileth not, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> for I wil not leaue thee, except firſt thou ſware, neuer to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Lady againſt her will. Alas, quoth he, I promiſe faithfully, and will performe it. Here-with <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> came, who gaue him his ſword and Shield againe, permitting him to go for helpe whether he would: and <hi>Amadis</hi> returned to the Tent, where the Damoſels reioyſing for his ſafe returne, ſaid. In ſooth Sir, we had beene diſhonored without your aide, which is much better then we expected, and ſuch, as not onely aſſureth your reuenge for <hi>Dardans</hi> iniurie, but the Ladyes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if fortune permit, you doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake her quarrell. Then was hee vnarmed, and after his wound was dreſt, he ſate downe to meat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                  <p>At their departure thence, they lodgded at a good Ladies Caſtle, where they were moſt courteouſly entertained, and on the morrow trauailed all day, without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture worthy rehearſal, arriuing neere <hi>Windſore</hi> where King <hi>Liſuart</hi> lay, when <hi>Amadis</hi> thus ſpake to the Damoſels. Faire Friends, I would not be known to any one, therefore til ſuch time as the knight come to the combate, I intend to with-hold my ſelfe from the place: and when the houre is, let-your Squire bring me tydings thereof hither. Sir, quoth the Damoſels, as yet there wants two daies of the aſſignation, therefore if you pleaſe we wil tarry with you: and our Squire ſhall goe into the Towne, and bring vs word when the Knight is arriued. I am well content, ſaid he: whereupon they pitched their. Tent betweene a little wood and a Riuer, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> preſntly put off his armour.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7179:46"/>
Now did the Damoſels change their opinion, and thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to go into the Towne, to ſee how things were in prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaying, they might returne when they pleaſed. <hi>Amadis</hi> not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking thereof, willed them to do ſo, in meane while (being vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) he mounted on horſe-backe, inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to ſtray abroad a little for his pleaſure, &amp; <hi>Ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dalin</hi> guided him through the wood. Riding along, as they were on the ſide of a little mountaine, he might eaſily behold the Towne, and when they were at the higheſt, they alighted from their horſes: when <hi>Amadis</hi> ſitting downe vnder a tree, caſt his eye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that part where he iudged the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> ſhould be, then regarding the walles, the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and the whole Caſtle, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing forth a vehement ſigh, hee ſayd. Ah happy Towers, within you is the onely flower of the world: and thou faire Towne, how fortunate art thou in containing that, which all the harts and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of men cannot comprehend? High in diuine grace were he, who for maintenance of this quarrell ſhould ſpend his life: but much happy he, that without other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate then his ſmall deſert, ſhould reach a bliſſe ſo incomparable. Then reſting his head on his arme, he entred into a deepe conceit, which prouoked him to ſudden ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and in this melancholly the teares trilled downe his cheekes: in mean while <hi>Gandalin</hi> who knew his complexion, ſtanding where he was vnſeene of any, eſpied a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troupe of Lords and Ladyes comming toward them, whereof he made haſt to aduertiſe the Prince, but he was ſo perplexed, as he could not anſwere, wherefore <hi>Gandalin</hi> tooke him by the arme, ſaying. My Lord, ſee you not what a great traine maketh toward vs? At theſe words he came to himſelfe, beginning to ſigh, and lifting his eyes to heauen, ſaid. <hi>Gandalin,</hi> if in this loue I were maiſter of my ſtrength, as I am in diuers other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: neither ſhouldeſt thou haue neede to aduertiſe me, not my ſelfe be without councell ſo much as I am. But I feele my ſelfe ſo oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as all the enemies in the world cannot bring me to ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as this ouer ruling paſſion doth: therefore I pray thee talke to me, of the felicity a man ſhall enioy in death, for other may I not taſte, and practiſe no meanes of my life, ſeeing the contrary doth ſurmount it. What my Lord? anſwered <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> eſteeme you the victory ouer your ſelfe ſo difficult, after ſo many conqueſts of ſtout and bold ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? Why do you not think, that peraduenture ſhe loueth you well, for whom you endure ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and happily by as great reaſon as you loue her? your perſoage, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe, beauty, and nobility of lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, can they deſerue leſſe, then the good grace of the moſt rare &amp; and exellent Lady in the world? let theſe humours (my Lord) repell your deſperations. Further hee would haue proceeded, but <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> brake him off in anger, ſaying. Wretch dareſt thou blaſpheme ſo much, as to ſay, that he who hath merited no conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world, may be equalled with ſo perfect a thing as is my Lady? enter no more into ſuch tearmes, if thou wilt not haue me thine enemy, and ſo looſe my conuerſation. Well, well, ſaid <hi>Gandalin,</hi> I pray ye wipe your eyes, leaſt thoſe that come hitherward perceiue you haue wept. What? anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> comes their any body? Yea mary, quoth <hi>Gandalin,</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:7179:46"/>
and now they be at hand: here-with he ſhewed him the Knights &amp; the Ladyes, who were hard by them, by time <hi>Amadis</hi> was mounted. Then (as though hee had ſtayed for their companie) hee ſaluted them, and riding among the traine hee beheld a Ladie (very comely and beautifull) who wept very grieuouſly, where-upon hee left the reſt, and rode with her, ſaying. Madame, God comfort yee, and giue you ioy. In ſooth, anſwered the Lady, and there of haue I need, in that (as now) it is very farre from mee, which except Heauen fauour me with better grace, I am vtterly out of hope euer to ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And ſo high a Maieſtie, ſaid <hi>Amadis</hi> can prouide therefore when he pleaſeth: Not-withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if you were ſo contented, I gladly would know the cauſe of your ſadneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Beleeue mee my friend, quoth ſhe, all that euer I enioy in this world, conſiſteth in the tryall of a Combate. By theſe wordes hee knew this to be the Lady of whom the Damoſels had tolde him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wherefore hee enquired fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if as yet ſhee had found a knight on her behalfe? No true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſayd the Lady, and (which grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth mee moſt of all) to morrow muſt my delay bee exterminate. What will ye then doe? anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> What would you that I ſhould doe? quoth ſhee, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and looſe all, vnleſſe (by hap) I finde one in the Kings Court, who mooued thereto by charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble compaſſion, will courteouſly defend the right of a deſolate wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Such fortune ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſhall I pray may befall yee, for I ſhould not be a little glad thereof, as well for your owne ſake, as alſo becauſe I neuer thought well of your aduerſarie. I thanke ye gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sir, quoth ſhe, to God, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the reuenge of my wrong. So paſſed on the Ladie, and <hi>Amadis</hi> turning bridle, rode backe to the Pauillion, where he found the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels, who were already retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the towne: and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they told him, how <hi>Dardan</hi> was come into the field, with full reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to doe his deuoire. And truſt me, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> it was my happe to meet the diſtreſſed Lady, euen the ſame whom the caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth: heere-with hee declared all the talke they had together.</p>
                  <p>But now is the houre of quiet come, and each one went to reſt till the point of day, when the Damoſels being riſen, came to tell <hi>Amadis,</hi> how they would goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Towne, and ſend him worde when <hi>Dardan</hi> was readie. Not ſo, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> I will not bee farre behinde yee, but let one ride before, to aduertiſe me when <hi>Dardan</hi> ſhews himſelfe in the field. After he was armed, they went all to horſe-backe, and being come to the iſſue of the Forreſt, he ſayd to the Damoſels. Now may you goe (if you pleaſe) for I will not depart this place till I heare ſome newes from you. Away they went, when <hi>Amedis</hi> alighting, tooke off his Helmet to refreſh himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner did the Sunne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the Eaſt, but the King came to the place appointed for the Combate (which was without the Towne, hard by the Walles) where <hi>Dardan</hi> not long after ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe, in ſuch manner and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage, as an ambitious man v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to gaine goods &amp; honour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo like an amourous Champion to maintaine the quarrell of his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: who to countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce him with the greater fauor, was queintly led
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7179:47"/>
by the reines of his Palfray, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting himſelfe before the king on his knees, he ſayd. My Lord, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordinance by you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, this Ladie and I humbly beſeechye, that the goods may be deliuered her, as is no more then reaſon: for if any Knight oppoſe him-ſelfe againſt her, heere am I readie for the Combate. The king then called for the Ladyes defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, but ſhe (poore ſoule) appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alone. Why Lady, quoth the King, are you vnprouided of a Champion, that you come with-out any to defend your right? So helpe me God (anſwered ſhe wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping) I am (my Lord) forſaken of all, except you grant me mercie. Great compaſſion had the King on her, for he knew her to be very vertuous: but he could not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order reaſon and the Law. In the meane while, <hi>Dardan</hi> who thought no reſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce would come, ſate downe in the middeſt of the field, attending the third houre, which was the time according to the cuſtome, when the King would pronounce ſentence to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour: but one of the Damoſels ſeeing nowe the needefull time, made haſte to let <hi>Amadis</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what want of his preſence was in the field. For this cauſe he immediately mounted on horſe-backe, and being armed as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, commanded the Damoſell and his Squire to goe ſome other way, for he would not be ſeene by any from whence he came: aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, that if he were Victor, hee would returne againe to the Tent. So departed <hi>Amadis</hi> alone, riding on a braue white Courſer, (as he promiſed the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> in <hi>Gaule)</hi> and arriued at the place where <hi>Dardan</hi> held the world in wonder of him. The king and his Nobles ſeeing him come from the Forreſt, ſtood ſomewhat in doubt of him, for hee carryed ſuch a gallant and Knightly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuance, as promiſed a-farre off that his enemie ſhould finde him of hautie diſpoſition: which made the King (aboue all other) deſirous to know him, and thinking ſhe for whoſe cauſe hee came knew his name, he called and demanded of her the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Dread Lord (anſwered the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) I neuer ſaw the man before, nor doe I know what he is. By this time was <hi>Amadis</hi> entred the field, when doing reuerence to the king and the Ladyes; with-out longer ſtay he came to <hi>Dardan:</hi> demauu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if hee were the man, that would maintaine the quarrell of her, for whom the poore Ladie was put to ſuch trouble; becauſe, quoth hee) I am come in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and alſo to keepe promiſe with thee. What didſt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me? replyed <hi>Dardan.</hi> That I would ſee thee in the day-time, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> &amp; wetteſt thou when? It was at ſuch a time, as thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whitled with wine, or glorie, or elſe the truſt thou hadſt in thy ſtrong Caſtle, ſpakeſt ſo out-ragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to me ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding without, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried both with trauaile &amp; hunger. And therfore doe I make the leſſe account of thee, anſwred <hi>Dardan:</hi> but cauſe her to come hither, for whom thou wilt doe ſuch a doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie deed, to know if ſhe will accept thee as her Champion, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward doe the vtter-moſt thou canſt. When the King ſaw they talked ſo long together, he would haue heard what they ſaid: but the good Widdow came, and to her, <hi>Dardan</hi> thus ſpake. Dame, this Knight would maintaine thy right, wilt thou ſubmit all to what he can
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7179:47"/>
doe? With all my heart (quoth ſhe) ſeeing it pleaſeth him to ſtand ſo much my Friend, and God ſpeed him no otherwiſe then my cauſe is iuſt. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the two knights were at the very point to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, the King perceiued that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> Shield was bruiſed in two places, both with ſtrokes of the Sword, and point of the Launce, wherefore he ſayd to ſuch as ſtood neere him, that if the Knight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded another ſhield, he would gladly giue him one: but <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſo hot in deſire to reuenge himſelfe and the Ladie, that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to nothing but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Thus the Ladyes accord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing receiued, the two Champions tooke their carrire againſt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo roughly, as their Launces pierced their Armour and flew in pieces, without any other harme as yet: but when their bodies met, <hi>Dardan</hi> was ſent to the ground, yet it happened ſo wel for him, as hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding faſt the reines of his horſe, he recouered himſelfe more nimbly, and mounted againe, as one both valiant and brauely diſpoſed, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetting hand to his Sword. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaw him ſo quickly vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, &amp; in ſuch readineſſe for his owne defence: hee approched to him, when began ſuch a battaile betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as euery one preſent maruailed thereat. On all ſides were placed the inhabitants of the Towne, and many other that came farre off, as well on mightie Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds in the fielde, as alſo on the towers and walles of the Caſtle: but aboue the reſt, the Queene was there preſent with her Ladies, moſt deſirous to behold who ſhould beare away the honour of this cruell Combate; for they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med two ſo gallant companions, as it was hard at firſt ſight to iudge the better. Such were the rigorous ſtrokes deliuered on either ſide, that ſparkes of fire flew foorth of their Helmets and Armonr, their Shields cut in pieces, and their blood colouring the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which mooued exceeding compaſſion in the Regardants, who ſeemed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partners in their danger, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as ech one fauoured the wel-fare of his Friend: but the two Champions gaue no reſpect ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, becauſe their deſire was to make knowne both to the Ladyes and themſelues, the man deſeruing higheſt account.</p>
                  <p>When King <hi>Liſuart</hi> ſaw them endure ſo long, he ſayd aloud, that hee neuer beheld a more ſingular Combate, purſued with greater courage and man-hood: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he determined not to depart, vntill he had ſeene the finall iſſue thereof, permitting them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as themſelues pleaſed. And to the ende (quoth hee) that the Conquerour may bee dignified with more their accuſtomed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I will cauſe his deſerts to be liuely carued in Marble, at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of my Pallace, to prouoke the like perfection in all other, that are deſirous to follow Armes. In ſuch manner as you haue heard continued the two Knights a long time, the ſtanders by being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcerne who had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for without taking breath or reſt their fury continued, as thogh their ſtrength had more and more encreaſed.

Now followed hee the fight with ſuch cruell extreames, as in ſhort time he diſſolued the doubt who ſhould be ſuperiour: for <hi>Dardan</hi> (not-withſtanding all his defence) was conſtrained to draw backe, ſeeking how to eſcape the wreake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtrokes of his enemie, which without ceaſing wounded his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in many places: his horſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no longer able to endure, ſtumbled ſo often, till at length he ſet both his knees to the ground, which made <hi>Dardan</hi> thinke it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to fight on foot, wherefore he ſayd to <hi>Amadis.</hi> Knight, our hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are wearie, and faile vs, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we cannot doe as we would: and if we were on foot (me thinks) in ſhort time the doubt would be diſcided.

                  <p>At this clamour, <hi>Amadis</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the voyce of the Damoſel of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and lifting vp his head, eſpyed her ſtanding by the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana:</hi> by means wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he became ſo farre beſide him-ſelfe, as hee ſet the point of his Sword to the ground, forgetting not onely the daunger wherein he was, but alſo ſtood amazed at the ſight of his Miſtres.

In an vnhappy houre did the Knight behold any Lady in this company, whereby he hath loſt what he wun of <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan:</hi> it is no time now for his heart to faint.

For this cauſe lifting vp his Sword, he gaue <hi>Dardan</hi> ſuch a ſtroke on the Helmet, as made him ſet both his hands to the ground: then falling vpon him, he rent the Helmet from off his head, &amp; tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled in ſuch ſort on him with his feet, as he fell downe like one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of his ſences. Afterward, taking him by the locks of his haire he beate him on the face with the pummell of his Sword, ſaying. Thou dyeſt <hi>Dardan,</hi> if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe

And when he had knowledge of the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (as hereafter the manner how is declared,) his name was placed thereon, and foure great Lyons at the foure corners of the ſepulchre, importing the de uiſe which <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> bare in his Shield.</p>
                  <p>But now the rumour being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, and they teturned to the Pallace, he called for the ſtranger that won the honor of the day: but after long enquiry, no one could certainly tell what was become of him, albeit certaine comming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wood, reported how they ſaw a Knight returne from the field thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-ward, being alone and making great haſt. He that is worthy, ſaide the King, to beare him company, may imagine himſelfe happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: for ſeeing he hath ſhewed himſelfe ſo braue a combatant, it is impoſſible but he ſhould be a wiſe and vertuous Knight.

But did you, (quoth <hi>Oriana)</hi> take no regard of his Armes? Yea mary did I, replied the Damoſell, albeit the cruell ſtrokes receiued thereon, made me hardly perceiue what deuiſe was there figured: yet me thought the ground was a golden field, and the like I told ye he bare in <hi>Gaule,</hi> with two azured Lions rampant por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed therein, which being bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered all in pieces, he preſently made him ſuch another, aſſuring me to weare no other when hee came into this country, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will doubt no further but it is he.

make his arriuall knowne to <hi>Oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> wherefore they were no ſooner riſen from the table, but he tooke <hi>Gandalin</hi> aſide, and thus began. My friend, thou muſt of neceſſity goe to the Court, and labour ſecretly to finde the Damoſel of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> to whom thou ſhalt report that I am here, attending to heare from her what I ſhall do. <hi>Gandalin</hi> with all poſſible ſpeed departed, and the better to execute his enterpriſe, he went on foote, when being come to the Pallace, not long had hee ſtayed till he ſaw her he looked for, who was as buſie as he in the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame cauſe: yet at the firſt ſhe knew him not, but quickly remembred ſhe had ſeene him in <hi>Gaule</hi> with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> and embracing him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded where his Maiſter was. Why Lady? quoth <hi>Gandalin,</hi> did not you ſee him to day? it was hee that vanquiſhed proud <hi>Dardan,</hi> and hath with-drawne himſelfe to the Forreſt to heare from his miſtreſſe, deſiring you by me, to let him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what he muſt do. Right welcome, ſaid the Damoſell, is he into this Country, being the man deſired aboue all othes: but my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy muſt needes ſee thee, therefore follow me. If any one aske who thou art, ſay thou bringeſt letters to <hi>Oriana</hi> from the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and likewiſe thou art come to look for <hi>Amadis,</hi> who is arriued heere as thou haſt heard: by theſe meanes thou mayeſt come to her without heere-after ſuſpition.</p>
                  <p>Thus was <hi>Gandalin</hi> conducted into the Queenes chamber, where the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> was, to whom the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> came, and ſpeaking ſome-what loude, ſayd. Madame, heere is a Squire ſent to you from the Queene of <hi>Scots.

                  <p>Then gaue he her a Letter, which he had feigned, hauing nothing written therein, but the ſuperſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the out-ſide: where-upon ſhe went aſide with <hi>Gandalin</hi> to one of the Windowes, making ſhewe to heare the reſt of his charge, but ſhe demaunded where he had left his maſter?

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I beſeech yee Madame, take compaſſion on him, appoint, a meeting together, then reſolue him, make me a happie meſſenger, and diſcharge your ſelfe of your deuoire: for hitherto hath hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſuch ſorrow, as no man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuffer the like. Often haue I ſeene him (thinking on you) ſo
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7179:50"/>
farre beyond himſelfe, as he hath fallen downe dead in (a manner) before mee, ſo that I haue imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (noting the abundance of his teares) his poore heart to be diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into water, through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits of his eyes. If he ſhould die ye offered him great wrong: for he is yours, &amp; eaſily can ye not finde another ſo worthy of you. Nor need you doubt, but if you graunt the houre of lengthning his life, he will ſurpaſſe in Chiualrie the beſt Knight that euer bare Armes: wherein if he be happy by his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, yet hath he miſhap to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe the ſame, onely through the paſſions he endureth for you. If now you will not deigne to afford him remedy, much better had it beene for him, that fortune had let him preiſh in the ſea, to the mercy whereof in his cradle coffin he was commited: then after his preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſuch ſtrange meanes, to ſuffer him dye by a worſe ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack then the other. But if his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall ſtarres wil not diuert this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, happy might he haue accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe, if he had neuer come to the knowledge of his parents, whoſe griefe likewiſe he greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, to ſee him ſo conſume &amp; dye before his day, being vnable to diuine or vnderſtand the cauſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gandalin</hi> all this while accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pained his words with ſuch teares, and often among breathed foorth ſo many mournefull ſighes, as would haue enforced the very Rocks to rueth: but perceiuing <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> was touched to the quicke, he began againe in this manner. Ah, gentle Madame, conſent not to the death of ſuch a Seruant of yours, and ſo good a Maiſter of mine: for beſide the common loſſe which will be great, in you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſhall conſiſt the fault, more-ouer you ſhall maculate that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beautie, with the high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſtaine of crueltie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. Here did he knit vp his perſwaſion, attending an anſwere from the Princeſſe, but ſhee was not able to deliuer one word, ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently was her heart ſurprized and ouer-come: and holding downe her head, let fall wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtreames of teares downe her daintie cheekes, which enforced her to turne on the other ſide, leaſt ſhe ſhould be diſcried: then when as <hi>Gandalin</hi> would haue begun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, ſhe ſtayed him with a pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſigh, ſaying. Ah, my friend, I pray thee ſay no more, vnleſſe thou be willing to ſee me die here preſently. Now ſtood ſhee ſilent a prettie while, often wringing and ſtraining her fingers with griefe, then ſetting apart all diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe ſoftly thus ſpake. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance thou giueſt me of thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters loue, is highly pleaſing and agreeable to me: but the paſſion thou ſayeſt he endureth, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth me to the very death, ſo that I feele both his paine &amp; mine owne. Ah God, let me not be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of death, to a man ſo high and precious of deſert as hee is, rather let me worke mine owne death, for if he die, I may not liue one houre. Thou art come to tell me his painefull trauaile, &amp; now thou mayeſt goe to let him vnderſtand mine, which if thou kneweſt ſo wel as thou doeſt thy maiſters, inſtead of blaming me with crueltie, thou wouldſt rather iudge me vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and if I vſe any crueltie, it is againſt my ſelfe, whom I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of reſt, pleaſure, and well-neere life it ſelfe. The leſſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour can I giue to mine owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, becauſe (as it often happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7179:50"/>
to our ſects, when thinking to draw neere ſuch as we deſire, we are furtheſt off, and ſeeking for a harbour of contentment, glaunce into a place of torment and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo falleth it out with mee by thy maiſter, whom fortune hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer kept mee furtheſt from, but God knowes my good wil hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way beene with him: and gladly would I prouide for his griefs and mine owne, if I were able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the meanes.</p>
                  <p>Doe then, Madame, what you may, anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> if you loue him (as I am ſure he doth you) and begin at this inſtant to let him know how hee ſhall behaue him-ſelfe in this Countrey. <hi>Oriana</hi> then ſhewed him a Garden, which was vnder the window where they talked, ſaying. Returne to thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and tell him, that this night he muſt ſecertly come to the place thou ſeeſt, &amp; remember this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, how the chamber (vnder where we ſtand) is the ſame that <hi>Mabila</hi> and I lodge in, and there is a croſſe barred window neere the ground, where-through we may eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne ech other, and talk together: for his Cozin is acquainted with mine affaires, nor is it neceſſarie they ſhould bee concealed from her. Then taking a coſtly Ring off her finger, ſhee thus proceeded. Deliuer him this token from mee, as the onely Iewell I moſt eſteem, and ere thou goeſt thou ſhalt ſee the Princeſſe <hi>Mabila,</hi> who is ſo wiſe and diſcreet, as ſhe will eaſily vnderſtand thee: yet thou muſt ſay ſome-what loud to her, that thou haſt brought her tydings from her mother. Here-upon <hi>Oriana</hi> called her to talke with the Squire, whom the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> (her mother,) had ſent to her: but when ſhe ſaw it was <hi>Gandalin,</hi> ſhe then ſuſpected how matters went: wherefore <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> went to the Queene, leauing them in deepe talke together. In meane while the Queene demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of her daughter, if the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman were to returne ſhortly, or no: For, quoth ſhe, I would ſend a token to the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> by him. Madame, anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> the chiefe cauſe of his comming into this Countrey, was to ſeeke for the good Knight <hi>Amadis,</hi> Son to the King of <hi>Gaule,</hi> of whom you haue heard ſuch famous report. And where is he? ſaid the Queen. The Squire ſaith, quoth <hi>Oriana,</hi> it is more then ten moneths ſince hee heard that he was heere, and now he maruaileth to miſſe of him in this Court. Now truſt me, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Queene, right glad would I be, to ſee ſo good a Knight in the Kings company, for it would be a great comfort to him many wayes hauing to deale with ſo many Countres: wherefore I aſſure ye, if he doe come hither, hee ſhall finde here ſuch honourable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, as he ſhal haue no cauſe to depart in haſte. Of his Proweſſe Madame, replyed <hi>Oriana,</hi> I know little, but what common bruite hath blazed abroad: but heereof I am certaine, how hee was one of the moſt braue yong Gentle-men that euer I ſaw, when in the King of <hi>Scots</hi> Court he ſerued <hi>Mabila</hi> and me. All this while <hi>Mabila</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with <hi>Gandalin,</hi> enquiring if his maſter were as yet arriued. Yea Madame, anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> the ſame was he that vanquiſhed <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun,</hi> and expreſſe charge hee gaue me to ſalue you on his behalfe. The name of Heauen be for euer pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, quoth ſhee, hauing preſerued our Kinſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7179:51"/>
ſaid <hi>Gandalin,</hi> hee were happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if the force of loue made him not in worſe caſe then dead: for Gods ſake therefore doe you aſſiſt him, being thus fully perſwaded, that if he finde no eaſe to cure his afflictions, you ſhall looſe the beſt Knight in the world, and the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of your fathers fame. He may be well aſſured, anſwered <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bila,</hi> how hee cannot with greater deſire employ mee, then I haue to doe him pleaſure: and will him not to faile in what the Princeſſe hath commanded him: as for thy ſelfe, being iudged to come from the Queene, my mother, thou mayeſt come and ſpeak with vs at al times as need ſhall require.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gandalin</hi> tooke his leaue for that time, returning toward <hi>Amadis,</hi> who attended the anſwere of life or death, and into ſuch debilitie was he brought by theſe extreams as hee had ſcant force enough to ſupport himſelfe: for the ſhort ſight hee had of his Ladie at the Combate, encreaſed ſuch a deſire in him to ſee her at more libertie, as euery houre ſeemed to him longer then a yeare. When hee ſaw that <hi>Gandalin</hi> was returned, in hope of happy newes, hee came and embraced him, not daring to demaund any thing of him, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt matters ſhould not fall out to his contentation: but <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> with a cheerfull cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, told him that he brought no ſadde tydings, and ruſhing into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at firſt, ſaid. My Lord, God make yee as conſtant, as you haue cauſe to be content, for if you haue that vertue, you are the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and accompliſhed Knight in the world. Ouer-whelmed with ioy, <hi>Amadis</hi> caught him in his armes, demaunding what he had done, ſeene, and heard? I haue ſeene and heard, anſwered <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> the felicities of Paradiſe, and know that they are prouided for you, if you hinder it not your ſelf. Ah <hi>Gandalin,</hi> quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> ieſt not with me, but tell me the very trueth. Then <hi>Gandalin</hi> declared word by word, how euery thing happened, firſt of the counterfeit Letter, and next the appointed meeting at the window: and (by the way) reported ſome part of his owne ſpeeches, moouing a change of conntenance in <hi>Oriana,</hi> then her anſwere, euen to the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before rehearſed: likewiſe how he talked with <hi>Mabila,</hi> and how willing ſhe was to aſſiſt him with her vttermoſt habilitie. <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſo fed with content by theſe reports, that hee made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe one thing ten times, and I cannot tell which of them was moſt affectionate: either <hi>Gandalin</hi> in reporting, or <hi>Amadis</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, for both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeemed inſatiable, in the end <hi>Amadis</hi> thus ſpake.</p>
                  <p>My faithfull Companion, I thought my ſelf altogether indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thy Father, who ſaued me from the daunger of drowning in the Sea, but I confeſſe, that duty belongs more neceſſarily to thee: becauſe (by thy diligence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion) thou haſt giuen me a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life then he preſerued. But tell me now, didſt thou take good marke of the place to which ſhe commuanded me? Aſſure your ſelfe thereof, quoth <hi>Gandalin.</hi> for ſhe her ſelf ſhewed it me. Ah God, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> how ſhall I deſerue the great good ſhe doth for me? Away from me now all ſorrowe and complaining. Yet this is not all my Lord, quoth <hi>Gandalin,</hi> See here a token ſhe hath ſent ye, as a teſtimonie of her honourable loue
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7179:51"/>
to you: ſo he gaue him the Ring which came from <hi>Oriana,</hi> and after he had long beheld it, kiſſing it a thouſand times, put it on his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſaying. Faire Ring, that haſt beene ſo happy, as to be caried and accounted deere by the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed creature in the world, albeit thou be now in a place of much inferiour honor yet haſt thou not changed thy miſtreſſe, for both thou and I are hers, and ſhe doth compaſſe my heart hith greater force, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou canſt poſſibly binde in my finger. Let vs leaue this talk, anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> and returne to the Damoſels, who tarry for vs in the Tent: but you muſt diſſemble conningly, for if they ſee you alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from your wonted mellanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. it may be ſome hinderance to your determination.</p>
                  <p>So they brake off co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, and went into the Pauillion, where <hi>Amadis,</hi> (notwithſtanding) <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> councell) could not but ſhew himſelfe pleaſantly diſpoſed, whereat the Damoſels were verie glad, becauſe ſuch behauiour, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beſeemed him then his former penſiuenes.</p>
                  <p>When the houre of reſt was come, each one went to his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſttomed lodging, and ſoone after <hi>Amadis</hi> ſeeing the time commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for his enterpriſe, aroſe and found <hi>Gandalin,</hi> who had already prepared for their iourney: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being armed, they mounted on horſe-backe, taking the moſt conuenient way for their purpoſe to the Towne. When they came to the Garden, which <hi>Oriana</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed <hi>Gandalin,</hi> they aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and tied their horſſes at a tuft of trees nere adioyning, afterward they went through a hole which a water-courſe had made in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wall, and approched the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow where <hi>Oriana</hi> lay: faire and ſoftly did <hi>Amadis</hi> knock thereon with his finger, ſhe not yet ſleeping who expected his comming, and when ſhe heard the louing ſignall of her friend, ſhe awaked <hi>Mabila,</hi> ſaying. Sweete ſiſter, I thinke your coſin knocketh at the window. My coſin? anſwered <hi>Mabila,</hi> it may be ſo, but you haue greater intreſt in him then I, or all other of his linage together. <hi>Mabila</hi> preſently aroſe, and lighted a waxe taper which ſhe had hid for the nonce, when <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> likewiſe was got out of bed, they came together and opened the caſement, where they found <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> no more attending then hec was attended. If they were then well pleaſed, it were folly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, for all the contentments in the world, might not be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the ioy of ſeeing each other. And without queſtion, they had two inducing reaſons thereto, for beſide the nouriſhment they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued together in their yonger yeeres, and their firſt amity, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by the rememberance and good opinion they had of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: their beauty and perfections were ſo correſpondent, as if they had neuer ſeene one another till that very inſtant, yet had they cauſe enough to loue together. <hi>Oriana</hi> had on ſuch braue attire beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the night, as ſet the heart of her loue on fire, for vnder a fine &amp; dainty white frontlet, appeared the rareſt golden treſſes of haire that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer nature made, and about her ſhoulders ſhe had a mantle of figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red cloth of gold, imbroidered all ouer with rich and coſtly flowrets, as it might beſeeme the greateſt Maieſtie in the world. And for her ſelfe, a thing more faire was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be found, the inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of her preſent comfort, dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7179:52"/>
her face with ſuch a heauenly beauty, as it ſeemed that nature in pride of her art, made this piece to excell all other in perfection. I will leaue you then to conſider on the iudgement of <hi>Amadis,</hi> who (when ſhe was nothing ſo glorious in fairenes) thought her worthy the loue of the beſt Knight in the world: now if he ſtood mute, blame him not, hauing the only iewell of his heart before him, and therefore ſhe to breake off this ſilence, firſt ſpake in this manner. My Lord, if I haue giuen you the liberty (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my duty and cuſtome) to ſee me in this place at an houre ſo vnfitting, you muſt commit the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the ſecurity, which our former nurturing together loyally promiſed, and likewiſe to the good opinion of your great vertues ſince that time encreaſed: which hath conquered no leſſe fauour in me, then honor and renowne in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places. <hi>Amadis</hi> to auoide fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſilence, thought it better to let his ſpeeches paſſe at aduenture, then (by holding his peace) to be reputed vnworthy this happines, or not ſo feruently touched with loue as ſhe was, to exclude all which doubts, he thus replied. Madame, I account my ſelfe not ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured by fortune in any thing elſe, as honored at my firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into your ſeruice, euen the very higheſt tipe of grace ſhe could affoord me: nor do I feele my ſelfe ſo beholding to my vertues, as I reſt double bound to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that report ſo wel of me. But when both theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits ſhall be excluded, yet is my loue and ſeruice to you ſo affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as they can deſerue no leſſe then this ſecret gentlenes: and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſhall allow me more ample courteſie, it may command a ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bond of duty, but not affection, for that is already ſo ſubſtantially grounded, that the vttermoſt good you can do me, is neither able to augment it, or the ſharpeſt vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes diminiſh it. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſeemely for a man, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the extremities he hath infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite times endured by this paſſion, the very leaſt griefe I receiued, hath beene the loſſe of reſt, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſleepe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mine eyes: and yet to afflict me with greater torment, my ſpirit hath ſeene in a dreame what it vnceſſantly deſired. How many times hath it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to me, in thinking on you to be ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded, that ſuch as haue ſeene me, reputed me not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of common ſince, but euen of very life it ſelfe? What moman, what child well beaten, hath euer powred forth ſo many teares, as I poore Knight haue done? yea my very chiefeſt enterpriſes huae I ſprinckled withall for your ſake: not as feeling my ſelfe a happy ſubiect in loue, but rather too little merit of my ſelfe, and much leſſe hope. This fauour proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you in deigning to heare me, is greater then euer I durſt hope for, and ſo farre doth it ſurmount my paſſions, as I cannot expreſſe the leaſt part of my ioy: my tongue likewiſe ſeemeth as vnprofitable &amp; ignorant of his office, hauing bin ſo long from ſeruing me to you. But aboue all, this impuiſſance in ſpeech, ſhall on my behalfe teſtifie to you, what all the words in the world cannot deliuer with ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent truth: for as all other beauty in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of yours is nothing, ſo before mine affection, al the other habilities of my ſoule vaniſh away, and become of no reckoning. Will you the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (good madame) with your courteſie ſupply my inſufficiencie, and (with pittie) giue me both life
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7179:52"/>
and my ſelfe: and conſerue that which elſe cannot be, vnleſſe it be yours onely. Theſe words vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis</hi> with ſuch interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſighes and teares, as witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed he had no intent of feigning, but rather knew how to ſuffer then ſpeake: wherewith <hi>Oriana</hi> moued to compaſſion, thus anſwered. I make no doubt (deere friend) but you loue me, in reſpect of the pains you haue taken for me, as alſo by what you haue now tolde me: and though I ſhould haue no ſigne thereof by ſpeech or ought elſe, yet am I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to beleeue, becauſe my heart hath no other deſire, but heerein conceiueth greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. And yet the torment I ſee you in with impacience, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth my quiet, for you being aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſufficient proues, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this, that I loue ye: me thinks you ſhould haue no further cauſe of ſo ſeuere affliction, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought to temper your paines, in that (through the vnion of our ſpirits) I feele no leſſe then you do your ſelfe. If you will not appeaſe them for your owne ſake, I pray ye let it be done for mine, the rather, that we may the oftner meete (if you pleaſe) publiquely: when ſuch ſadnes will but diſcouer, what wee moſt willingly would keepe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, whereby may ariſe two great inconueniences, and be a meane to hinder the thing we chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt deſire. Sweete Lady anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I haue ſuch felicitie in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearing you, as wanting ſtrength enough to vnder-prop the burden of ſo eſpeciall conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: I am faine to fall downe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, experimenting no leſſe the paine of not accuſtomed pleaſure, then the other beſide of continuall penſiuenes, which makes me won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that I cannot dye heere in this ſolace. If then I haue offended you by this tranſportation, pardon it in your owne ſelfe, who brought me to this happy miſ-fortune, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gaue me this hurtfull medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: ſuffer me then yet longer to vſe it, that in the aſſurance of your grace, I may by little and little learne to ſupport it, and attaine the knowledge of liuing content: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing my apprenti-ſhood in this felicity, being yet ſcant skilfull enough how to vſe it. Loue is ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and be it fauourable or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it cannot be without paſſion, working the like affect in other, which you reproue in me. Well haue you ſaid my friend, anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> how you are as yet but an Apprentiſe: and ſo you ſhew very well by your words, prouing that loue cannot be without paſſion. I hope to ſee the time, when you (at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining greater and more perfect knowledge therein, then yet you haue) ſhall be in higher tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of minde, which (it may be) you thinke cannot be had in this world. Nor ſhall it not happen to you by admiration of that which now you moſt loue, and is likewiſe of farre more leſſe account: but by the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing wherein felicity conſiſteth, the knowledge whereof vniteth and lifteth the ſpirits ſo high as heauen. And albeit I am yet ſo yong in yeeres and diſcretion, as I cannot be exempt from the ill you complaine on: yet am I not vnprouided of deſire to haſten the time, when we ſhall liue together merry &amp; contented. Ah Madame, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> the hope of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py day, ſhall make mee paſſe this mournfull life in patience, ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for your honor my inward paines ſo couertly as I can, &amp; bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the outward with what cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage poſſible I may: but I beſeech
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7179:53"/>
ye do me the fauour, as to tell mee when it will be. Well perceiued <hi>Oriana,</hi> that he had not thorowly vnderſtood her meaning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſmiling ſhe ſaid. It is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy begun, but the da ling of your eyes will not let you ſee it. Heere-with <hi>Amadis</hi> became very penſiue, holding his eyes ſtedfaſtly fixed on her, and ſhe to change his ſadnes, tooke him by the hand thorow the window: which <hi>Amadis</hi> kiſſed a thouſand times, without any word paſſing betweene them, and <hi>Mabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> noting it, ſhe came to them ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Gentles you forgot your ſelues. <hi>Amadis</hi> lifting vp his head, courteouſly ſaluted her, ſhe doing the like to him, and after ſundry ſpeeches of wellcome, as alſo how long they deſired to ſee him: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bila</hi> dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, what length of time he intended to ſtay in the Court. So long as it ſhall pleaſe Madame <hi>Oriana,</hi> anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> It muſt be then continually, quoth <hi>Oriana,</hi> and you ſhall grant it if the King requeſt it. Sweete Madame, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> if it pleaſe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie ſo much to honor me, I will obey both him and you: yet will I diſſemble ſtrangnes awhile. All the better, replied <hi>Mabila,</hi> and in the meane time I pray ye viſit vs often. Longer they would haue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in talke, but <hi>Gandalin</hi> gaue them warning how the day appeared, wherefore he ſaid to <hi>Amadis.</hi> My Lord, me thinkes you are impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, but then you muſt needs accuſe the day. <hi>Amadis</hi> gaue no eare to him, for he proceeded on ſtill with his deuiſe: but <hi>Oriana</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſaid true, thus ſpake to <hi>Amadis.</hi> Now goe my Lord if you pleaſe, for it is time, &amp; forget not your promiſe. Then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her by the hand, and kiſſing it, he went to horſe-backe, returning to the wood where he left the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels, who had by entreaty ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly perſwaded him, to goe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their coſin that the King held captiue, vntill ſuch time ſhee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her Champion, as you haue heard: wherefore after they had reſted till morning, they returned to the Towne, in the greateſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and expectation of the world.</p>

My Lord, all the goods I haue you gaue me, for of you I hold them and no other, diſpoſe therefore of them as you pleaſe: but <hi>Amadis</hi> brake her off in this maner. Come Lady, let vs goe before the King, to the end he may acquit you, and I returne where vrgent affaires call me: ſo taking off his Helmet, hee rode on to the Pallace with the three Ladyes. The people knowing

him to be the man that ouer came <hi>Dardan</hi> made ſuch thronging in the ſtreetes to ſee him, as the king was giuen to vnderſtand thereof: and he reioycing at his comming, honored him ſo much, as he came to meete and receiue him on the way, thus ſpeaking to him. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy knight, hither are you ſo wel-come, as may be deuiſed, becauſe we haue beene very deſirous to ſee you. <hi>Amadis</hi> noting this gracious entertainment, ſetting his knee to the ground, thus anſwered. The God of Heauen giue your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie a long and happie life: then the king taking him by the hand, cauſed him to ariſe, ſaying. Right glad am I to haue knowledge of you, being a knight of ſo excellent deſeruing: theſe wordes enforced <hi>Amadis</hi> to bluſh, yet he replyed in this manner. My Lord, to deſire the Ladyes diſcharge whom you cauſed to be detained, I am bold to come before your Highneſſe: and ſeeing ſhe hath anſwered the Law according to your appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (hereafter) I hope ſhe may enioy her libertie: yet till this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhe knew not who maintained her quarrell againſt <hi>Dardan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While the King &amp; <hi>Amadis</hi> thus conferred together, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people gathered about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ſome commending his beautie, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his gallant youth, and all in generall his famous Chiualrie: in that hee being ſo young, had the power to vanquiſh <hi>Dardan,</hi> who was redoubted &amp; feared through all <hi>Brittaine.</hi> By this time, ſundry ſpeeches paſt betweene him and the King, where-among he diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his ſpeedie departure, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke a deſire in him to ſtay him, and thus ſpake <hi>Amadis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dread Lord. ſeeing the Ladie is free, I deſire leaue for my returne againe: but if in ought I may doe your Maieſtie any ſeruice, I am the man readie to bee commaunded: and you the Prince whom moſt I deſire to honour. Good Friend, quoth the King, your departure muſt not be ſo ſoone, except you delight to diſpleaſe me. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> in reſpect my endeauout is altogether to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey you. Doe you thinke, ſayd the King, it is any obedience, if I may not entreat a longer ſtay? In ſooth, my Lord, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> you may and ſhall command, for in greater matters then this I will not offend ye. Goe then and vn-arme you, replyed the King; and ſpeaking theſe wordes, him-ſelfe tooke him by the hand conducting him to a ſumptuous chamber, where he left him to take ſome refection, with <hi>Arban</hi> King of <hi>Norgalles,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to keepe him companie: for King <hi>Liſuart</hi> was a Prince, that eſpecially fauoured and honoured ſtrange Knights. Hauing left <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> thus worthily accompained, he went to the Queene, and tolde her in what manner hee had ſtayed the good Knight who ouercame <hi>Dardan.</hi> But doe yee (my Lord, quoth ſhe) know his name? No verily, anſwered the King, for in reſpect of the promiſe I made him I durſt not demaund that queſtion of him. It may be, ſayd the Queen, he is the Sonne to King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule.</hi> I would it might fall out ſo well, anſwered the King. Doe you know, quoth the Queene who may put vs out of this doubt? euen the Squire that talked with <hi>Mabila,</hi> who came to ſearch him in your Court, and ſaid, how hee was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed of his arriuall in this Countrey long before. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the King cauſed <hi>Gandalin</hi> to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7179:54"/>
be called, and with-out declaring any thing to him, thus ſpake: Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, for I muſt ſhew a Knight to thee, that I may bee reſolued if thou know him or no. <hi>Gandalin</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on the King, entring the chamber where <hi>Amadis</hi> was, and <hi>Gandalin</hi> viewing him very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, ſeigned to haue ſeene him long time ſince, then ſetting his knee to the ground, ſayd. Ah my Lord, great trauaile haue I endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to finde you, ſince I departed from the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Court. <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> my good friend, right heartily art thou will-come to mee, what newes doeſt thou bring? None but good, my Lord, anſwered <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> all your noble Friendes are in perfect health, commending them-ſelues to your Excellencie, but hence forth Sir, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale your ſelfe no longer: then turning to the King he thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. Mightie King, hee that hath beene ſo long time vnknown, is this braue Prince, the famous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> Sonne to the inuincible king <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule:</hi> and then came his Fathes to vnderſtand ſo much, when he ſlewe in combate the puiſſant King <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by meanes whereof he recouered his Realme which was well-neere loſt. By theſe deuiſes was <hi>Amadis</hi> diſcoured, and better wel-commed then before: for till the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was not knowne, but through his famous deedes, the renowne whereof was euery-where blazed abroad, and now was hee ſo well honoured for his vertue as his Nobleneſſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. So ſpent they the whole day in honourable Feaſting, vntill ſuch time as each one with-drew him-ſelfe; when king <hi>Liſuart</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the King of <hi>Norgalles,</hi> that he ſhould lodge in <hi>Amadis</hi> chamber: afterward when they were alone, to ſound his minde, &amp; vnderſtand by all meanes poſſible, if he would conſent to remaine in his ſeruice. Thus leauing them together, hee returned to the Queene, and to her thus ſpake. Madame, hardly ſhall I cauſe <hi>Amadis</hi> to ſtay (as mine) nor can I tell which way to compaſſe it, albeit, I neuer had greater deſire to any Gentle-man of long time, for the high account is helde of him, would cauſe mee to bee much more feared and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted. My Lord, quoth the Queene, graunt him any thing he ſhall demaund, and doe your ſelfe preſent him what you imagine will beſt pleaſe him. Hee reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth nothing of me, replyed the king, for if he did, I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereto more willingly then he could deſire. Me thinkes it were good, ſayd the Queene, to entreat him firſt, by ſome other of our Court, &amp; if they cannot preuaile, will him to come ſee mee, your daughter, and our Cozin <hi>Mabila:</hi> they likewiſe ſhall ſolicite the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for they knew him when hee ſerued them as a Squire. Then ſhall we let him vnderſtand, how all the Knights here are yours, and none but thinks him-ſelfe honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereby: him will we deſire to be one of the Company, that you may enioy his ſeruice when need ſhall require. This will be a good meane, anſwered the king to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his ſtay, and if he will not be wonne by you, we may well iudge him of leſſe ciuility the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chiualry. Now becauſe it waxed ſome-what late, the King bade his Queene good-night, &amp; went to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. On the other-ſide, the king of <hi>Norgalles</hi> perſwaded his new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come gueſt, that he would abide in the Court of king <hi>Liſuart:</hi> but <hi>Amadis</hi> could ſo cunningly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7179:54"/>
that he altogether diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the chiefe point of his deſire, and might not by all theſe entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be wonne. When he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued he laboured in vaine, on the Morrow-morning hee brought him to the king, of whom <hi>Amadis</hi> made offer to take his leaue: But the king anſwered him in this manner. My good friend, you ſhould haue done me pleaſure not to depart ſo ſoone, yet can I not conſtraine ye to tarrie againſt your will, but my Queene would gladly ſee you before your departure. Nor will I goe my Lord, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> before I haue done my dutie to her: where-upon taking him by the hand, he brought him into her Chamber, and thus ſpake to her. See heere, Madam, king <hi>Perions</hi> Sonne of <hi>Gaule,</hi> who is come to ſalute you before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. In ſooth my Lord, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Queene, he doth mee great honour, and he is very hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wel-come hither.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtepping to her, fell on his knee to kiſſe her hand, but ſhe cauſed him to riſe and ſit downe by her: when the king per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing they would enter into fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther talke, with drew himſelfe to diſcourſe with his knights, while they conferred together. In mean while the Queene courteouſly entertained <hi>Amadis,</hi> but the other Ladies and Gentle-women, who had heard ſuch ſame of his beautie and excellent perfections, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to eye him very diligently, maruailing that Nature had ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched him, with the onely thing they moſt deſired. Now knew <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> by their countenances what iudgement they held of him, yet durſt he not turne his head aſide, fearing leaſt ſeeing his <hi>Oriana,</hi> by ſome ſudden mutation, hee might reueale what carefully he couetted to hide. And as he continued in this perplexitie, the Princeſſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bila</hi> came and did him reuerence, where-upon the Queene (the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to compaſſe her intent) called her daughter, who diſſembled as if ſhe ſeant knew him, and thus ſhee ſpake to her. Faire daughter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you not the ſonne of king <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> who ſerued you well while he was your Squire. and yet may doe (if it pleaſe him) now he is a Knight? in ſoothe, you muſt al aſſiſt me in deſiring him to grant mee one requeſt. And know ye what it is? quoth ſhe to <hi>Amadis,</hi> the king earneſtly entreateth you to remaine in his Court, and yet as I vnderſtand, you haue no wil to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him ſo ſamll a fauor. We ſhal ſee anon, if Ladies hold greater Priuiledge in knights, then men doe, therefore wee all ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one ſuite, that you would be knight to my daughter and my ſelf, &amp; likewiſe to whom them you ſee in this faire co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie. And if you will doe ſo much for vs, you ſhall deliuer vs from ſeeking ſupport in any other, who happily cannot be ſo agreeable to vs: for wel we know if you be our knight, we ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe all them that attend on the king. The Ladyes were before ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, what they ſhould doe in this caſe, wherefore they flocked about him altogether, and with ſignes of earneſt Supplication, confirmed the Queenes requeſt: eſpecially <hi>Oriana,</hi> who gaue him a ſigne that he ſhould conſent, but very wiſely diſſembled it, although he had no other deſire in the world: wherefore the Queene ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo ſlow in anſwering, as if ſhe would haue preſſed him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſaid. Well, Sir <hi>Amadis,</hi> what? ſhall we be denyed? Madame, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7179:55"/>
                     <hi>Amadis,</hi> what is he that dare do otherwiſe, then grant your will and theſe Ladyes preſent, ſeeing you are the moſt honorable Queen of the world, and they likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the higheſt point of ſeruice? therefore madame, by your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and the Princeſſe <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> as alſo theſe other Ladyes who are loth to be denied, I am content to tarry with you: yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this condition, that I will doe nothing but for you onely, and if I acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſh any ſeruice for the King, it ſhall be yours and none of his. Then as our Champion, anſwered the Queene, all we accept you: &amp; theſe glad tidings ſhe ſoone ſent to the King, who was ſo highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therewith, that he commanded the King of <hi>Norwales</hi> to goe and beare him company, and himſelfe for ioy went preſently to him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taking him in his armes, he ſayd. Gentle Knight, right glad am I of your conſent to the Queene, and for my part be you well aſſured, that my deſire is to entreat you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your deſerts. <hi>Amadis</hi> on his knee humble thanked him, albeit he only ſtaied by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of <hi>Oriana,</hi> and no ſuch other matter as he feigned to the Queene.</p>
                  <p>For this time the author leaueth <hi>Amadis,</hi> returning where he left the Prince <hi>Galaor,</hi> who being departed from the Duke of <hi>Bryſtoyaes</hi> Caſtle, where the villainous Dwarffe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily diſcouered him: all that day he wandred in the Forreſt of <hi>Arinida,</hi> not meeting any one to direct him a more ready way, yet toward euening, he ſaw a Squire come toward him, mounted on a right good Courſer. Now had <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> receiued a certaine wound, by one of the three Knights that aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him as you haue heard, which by reaſon of dallying with his new friend the night paſt, began to fef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ranckle very much, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelfe not halfe currant, he ſaid to the Squire. My friend, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt thou where I may finde cure for a ſmall wound I haue? What if I do? anſwered the Squire, yet will I not company any ſuch coward as thou art, becauſe it were to my ſhame and diſcredit if I ſhould. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of that, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> tell mee where I may finde helpe for my wound? Rather, quoth the Squire, would I ſeeke one to giue thee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Shew me the way, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Galaor,</hi> and I will aduenture what thou feareſt me withall, I may chuſe, ſaid the Squire, except I liſt. Nay thou ſhalt do it, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> by friendſhip or force. By force, replied the Squire, thinkeſt thou I will do any thing for ſo bad and falſe a Knight as thou art? Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Galaor</hi> heard him ſpeake ſo impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, he drew his ſword, making ſhew as if he would ſmite off his head, ſaying. Villaine thou ſhalt conduct me, elſe will I ſend thy ſoule to all the Deuils. The Squire being affraid, thus anſwered. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou enforceſt me, I will bring thee to a place where thy folly ſhall be chaſtiſed, and my outrage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged. Heere-with he rode be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, leauing the right way, <hi>Galaor</hi> following ſome diſtance behinde him, and by time they had ridden the length of a mile, they came to a Fortreſſe ſeated in a pleaſant vally, brauely enuiro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ed about with trees: the Squire the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pointing him to the place, ſaid. Now mayſt thou let me goe, for here I hope will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged the iniury thou haſt done me. Go thy way to al the Deuils, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Galaor,</hi> for I haue enough of thy company. Scant wilt thou like my conducting, ſaid the Squire,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7179:55"/>
before thou departeſt from this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell: wherewith he turned brible and away, but <hi>Galaor</hi> followed the path that guided to the Caſtle, which in his iudgement was but newly edified, and being come to the gate, he ſaw within a Knight ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med mounted on horſebacke, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on by fiue halberders, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided to forbid entrance into the Caſtle: who comming to him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded if he were the man that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed their Squire. I know not, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> whether he be your Squire or no, but hither am I come by the conduct of a varlet, the moſt audatious rogue that euer I knew, It may be ſo, replied the Knight of the Caſtell: but what would you haue in this place? Sir, quoth <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor,</hi> I am ſore wounded, and ſeeke for one to giue me helpe. Enter then, ſaid the Knight. <hi>Galaor</hi> rode in, but preſently the Knight &amp; his ſouldiers very fiercely aſſailed him, yet the firſt that came before him, thinking to ſtrike at his head with his halberd, was folowed ſo neer, as <hi>Galaor</hi> ſnatched his weapon out of his hand, giuing the Knight ſuch a wound therewith, that he fell down dead. Then entring among the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he gaue them ſo many rough and ſharpe charges, as in the end three of them were ſlaine outright, the other two fled ſo faſt as they could into the Caſtle: and <hi>Galaor</hi> would haue purſued them, but that his Squire cryed to him: My Lord take your Armes, for within mee thinkes I heare a great rumour of people, my ſelfe will take this hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet to aſſiſt ye if ye ſtand in need: and although I am vnworthy the order of Chiualry, yet will I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my Lord to my vttermoſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: ſo threw he downe the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet, taking vp a halberd and a Shield belonging to one of them that were ſlaine. Aſſure thy ſelfe, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſo ſoone as I finde him that gaue me Knight-hood, thou ſhalt for thy forwardnes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe haue thine. So paſſing further, they ſaw two other armed Knights come forth, and ten Soulders with them, who were brought out at the gate by the other that fled away. Now was the Squire that conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Galaor</hi> to this Caſtle, ſtanding ſhewing himſelfe at one of the caſements, and he cryed aloude to this freſh ſupply. Kill him, kill him, but ſaue his horſe to do me ſeruice. <hi>Galaor</hi> looking vp, preſently knew him, at whoſe words his heart was ſo enraged, that he fiercely ran to meete the new aſſaylants: in which encounter their Launces brake, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially <hi>Galaor</hi> on him that gaue the firſt charge, as he made him ſure enough from euer bearing armes afterward. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſetting hand to ſword aduanced himſelfe to the other, deliuering him ſo ſound a greeting, that he tumbled from his horſe with his heeles vpward: and turning to the halberders on foot, he ſaw his Squire had diſpatched two of them, wherefore to harten him the more, he thus cried to him. My friend thou haſt begun very well, not one of the reſt ſhall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape vs, becauſe ſuch villaines are vnworthy to liue. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Squire that was in the windowe few this bloudy conflict, he haſtely ranne vp a ladder into a high Tower, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out ſo loud as he could in this manner. My Lord, arme your ſelfe vnleſſe you meane in be ſlaine. By chance <hi>Galaor</hi> vnderſtood him, whereupon he ſtepped aſide to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what ſhould enſue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he ſaw a Knight come forth armed, and one bringing a horſe for him ready to mount: but <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> ſtepping betweene, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the bridle, giuing theſe ſpeeches to the Knight. Another time Sir, learne to mount your horſe ſooner, for I haue occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vſe this horſe, &amp; mean to keep him til you can get him from me. Greatly aſtonied was the knight when he heard him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all this while he had not ſeen him, whrefore he returend this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Are you he that haue ſlaine my two Nephewes, &amp; the other heere in the Caſtle? I know not who you aske for, replied <hi>Galaor,</hi> but this I can aſſure ye, how I found here the moſt diſloyall &amp; bad minded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that euer I delt withal. I tel thee, ſaid the Knight, they who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſt ſlaine were better then thou art, &amp; deerely ſhalt thou pay for thy boldenes. Heerewith they began a fierce and cruell combate on foot, for the Knight of the Caſtle was a man of great valour, and ſuch as had ſeene this dangerous fight, would haue maruailed that they could endure halfe ſo many blows. Yet in the end, the Knight found himſelfe too weake for <hi>Galaor,</hi> wherefore he thought to ſaue him-ſelfe by flight: but he was followed ſo neere, as hauing entred a porch, he was conſtrained to leap out at a window, and falling on a great heape of ſtones, with weight of his armour brake his neck. When <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> ſaw his deſparate end, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe curſing the Caſtle &amp; the wicked inhabitants, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by a chamber, he heard a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dolefull voice crying. Ah my Lord, leaue me not to ſuffer any more. <hi>Galaor</hi> ſtepping neere, ſaid. Open the dore then. Ah Sir, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, anſwered the voice, for I am tied with a ſtrong chaine. By theſe words, <hi>Galaor</hi> knew well it was ſome priſoner, wherefore he ranne againſt the dore with his foote ſo ſtrongly, that he made it flye from off the hindges, &amp; entring, beheld a faire Damoſell tied by the neck with a great chaine, who thus ſpake to <hi>Galaor.</hi> Alas my Lord, what is become of the maiſter of this Caſtle and his company? They be all dead, quoth he, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither to ſeeke cure for a wound I receiued in fight, they cauſed me to enter, and afterward ſet vpon me: but by the helpe of God I haue ſo well defended my ſelfe, as they ſhall neuer doe more harme to any liuing body. Heauen be praiſed, anſwered the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, for your happy ſucceſſe, and leaue me not in this miſery, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliuered, right ſoone ſhall I make whole and ſound your wounds. Preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly did <hi>Galaor</hi> breake the chaine, and the Damoſel tooke out of acofer two little bottles, with other pretious things belonging to the Lord of the Caſtle, and ſo came downe together into the Court: where <hi>Galaor</hi> perceiued how the firſt Knight hee iouſted withall was not yet dead, but tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing to his end, wherefore to let him languiſh no longer, he ſo tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on his breſt with his horſe feete, as quickly his ſoule forſooke the body, afterward they rode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way deuiſing on many matters.</p>
                  <p>This Damoſell was wiſe, well gouerned, &amp; of good grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe could ſo queintly anſwer &amp; intreate <hi>Galaor,</hi> that he became highly enamoured of her: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to endure no longer this kindled fire of affection, thought good to make ſome proofe if ſhee would loue him, whereupon hee thus began. You know (faire Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell and my friend) that I haue deliuered you from priſon, but in giuing you liberty, I am become my ſelfe captiue, and brought into great danger vnleſſe you helpe me.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7179:56"/>
You may be well aſſured my Lord, quoth ſhe, that the matter were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie difficult, wherein I would not obey you, ſtanding ſo deepely bounden to you as I do: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I might be reckoned among the moſt ingratefull women of the world, conſidering the miſery you ſo lately deliuered me from, and therefore doe I remaine at your diſpoſition. In theſe familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences they proceeded ſo far, as the execution of this hotte loue ſoone after followed, taſting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the benefit of ſuch content, as other may do the like that haue ſo good fortune: &amp; thus merily they paſſe this night, in the Pauili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of certaine Hunturs they met withal in the Forreſt. So <hi>Galaor</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by this Damoſell, eaſe of his new wound loue had made, &amp; cure of the other he got in fight.</p>
                  <p>For certain daies they remained in this wood, during which time the damoſel told him, how ſhe was daughter to <hi>Thelois</hi> the <hi>Fleming,</hi> not long ſince County of <hi>Clare</hi> by the gift of King Liſuart, and a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whom he had often entreated as his friend. But one day, quoth ſhe, being with my mother in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry not far hence, the Lord of this Caſtle (whom you haue ſlaine) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me in mariage, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my parents miſliked thereof, by reaſon of his vngracious beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: he watched a day when I was ſporting among other Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, from whom he forcibly caried me away, furiouſly thruſting me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the priſon where ye found me, ſaying. Be well aſſured Damoſell, that ſeeing thou haſt diſdained to match with me in mariage, and made ſo little account of my great renowne: while thou liueſt thou ſhalt not depart hence, til thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the reſt of thy kindred come entreate me to take thee as my wife. Perceiuing how ſeuerely he was bent againſt me, I ſet downe my reſt on patient hope, thinking it better for a time to endure that captiuity, then by making him my husband ſuffer a worſe. Great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had ye therein, anſwered <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> but tell me now I pray ye, at parting hence what ſhall become of you? for I am conſtrained to make little ſtay, and muſt trauaile very farre, being too much trouble for you to follow me. I deſire yee, quoth ſhe, conduct me to the Monaſterie from whence I was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for my mother is there, who will be right ioyfull to ſee me at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. With all my heart, replied <hi>Galaor:</hi> ſo mounting on horſeback, about Sun ſetting they arriued at the monaſterie, where they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with great ioy, eſpecially when the Damoſell had declared his worthy deeds of Chiualry done for her: and albeit he determined a ſpeedy departure, yet at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the faire fiſters, he taried there longer then before he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Graies</hi> returned from his enterpriſe in <hi>Gaule,</hi> after <hi>Amadis</hi> had vanquiſhed king <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was knowne to his father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as you haue heard: addreſſed his iourney toward <hi>Norway,</hi> where he hoped to finde his Lady <hi>Oliuia.</hi> Riding one day along ſomewhat neere the ſea ſide, on a ſudden hee had a Hart in chaſe, which when he had ſome prittie while purſued, he gained at length the top of a mountaine, from whence he might eaſily deſerne the raging bellowes of the ſea. Suddenly aroſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great tempeſt, which with mighty windes ſo troubled the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the thunder ratled with ſuch violedce, as if heauen and the neather religion would haue met together. At length he eſpied a ſhip toſſed in the tempeſt, veterly deſtitute of any ſafety, and (which was worſe) ſubiect to the mercy of a darke comfertleſſe night inſuing: wherewith he being moued to pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, commanded his Squires (as a ſignall) to make certaine blazes of fire, that they in the ſhip might chuſe their beſt la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding place, with-out periſhing in the darke, him-ſelfe minding to ſtay to ſee the end: which happened ſo well, by the helpe of God and dilligence of the mariners, as the ſhip tooke ſafe harbour nere where <hi>Agraies</hi> was, when they landed certaine Ladies, who were greatly affrighted with the maruailous tempaſt, thinking they could not haue eſcaped ſo long, <hi>Agraies</hi> being one of the moſt courteous Princes in the world, ſeeing them ſo well landed and free from danger, ſent one of his Squires, to will them come and refreſh themſelues in his pauillion: which gentlenes they refuſed not, and becauſe he was loth to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to them, knowing they had now neede of nothing more then reſt, he concluded this night not to ſee them, keeping himſelfe cloſe in his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. The Ladyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeperated to their owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the mariners made great fiers on the ſhoare to dry their garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and afterward fell to ſleeping, that they wakened not till next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <hi>Agraies</hi> deſirous to ſee ſtrange women, yet more to ſerue and honor them, then to remoue his affection from where it was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laed: priuily pried in to behold their countenances, they being round ſet about a fiere, reciting to each other pleaſantly their paſſed dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. As thus he liſtened their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, among the reſt he knew the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia,</hi> toward whom he was trauailing by vertue of her meſſage: and you muſt imagine him ſo intirely addicted to her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, as alſo ſhe in affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him, that they might well be tearmed happy in their loue. No ſooner had <hi>Agraies,</hi> eſpied her, but he was ſo ouercome therewith, as being no longer able to diſſemble, hauing before his eyes her ſo late perill of ſhip-wracke, he breathed forth a vehement ſigh, ſaying. Ah diuine comfort, helpe me. When the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies heard this cry, eſpecially <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia,</hi> thinking ſome one of their
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7179:57"/>
company was not well, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her women to open the dore: which preſently they did, when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> told one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who he was, that ſhee might ſecretly imparte the ſame to her miſtreſſe; the news whereof were ſo welcome to her, as immediatly ſhe commanded him to enter. Then were embracings &amp; kiſſings freely entercourſed, with al other gracious fauours ſo kind lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers could deuiſe, euen the very point wherein loue triumpheth: ſo that the faire Princeſſe loſt the name of a maiden, with like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as other who haue aſſaied, and can more then imagine what I meane. So pleaſing was this happy meeting, as they ſoiourned there ſix dayes together, beguiling the time with riciprocall courteſies; yet ſo ſecretly, as none in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany (except her Damoſels) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>
                  <p>Meane while the ſea became na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigable, the weather faire, and the waters calm: which made the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe determine to goe aboord her ſhip, that ſhe might paſſe into great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> whither the King her father had ſent her, to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the Queene <hi>Briſena.</hi> Which being vnderſtood by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies,</hi> after he had acquainted her with the cauſe of his iourney, hee gaue her aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: that very ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he would come to her, as well to ſhew her his faithfull ſeruice, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſeeke his coſin <hi>Amadis</hi> in king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, according as hee made him promiſe; wherewith ſhe was not a little contented, deſiring him earneſtly not to tary long fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her. Thus courteouſly taking leaue of each other, the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia</hi> departed vnder ſayle, and in fewe dayes after they landed in great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> when comming to <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore,</hi> where King <hi>Liſuart</hi> kept his Court: both by him, the Queene, <hi>Oriana,</hi> and all the other Ladyes, was the Princeſſe and her trayne graciouſly welcommed, as well to honor the King her father, as alſo in reſpect of her excellent beauty.</p>
                  <p>Now remained <hi>Agraies</hi> on the ſea ſhore, giuing many a long look after the ſhip which caried away the iewell of his heart; and hauing loſt the fight of it, he tooke his way to <hi>Briantes,</hi> a right good towne in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the King his father ſoiourned, and his Vncle <hi>Galuanes Without land,</hi> in whoſe company he intended ſhortly to viſit King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarts</hi> Court. For there, quoth hee to <hi>Galuanes,</hi> ſhall we finde more good Knights, then in any other Court of King Chriſtian, there likewiſe may we gaine honor and renowne better then in <hi>Scotland:</hi> where we haue none to trye our ſelues againſt, vnleſſe ſome fewe that ſlenderly follow Armes. This <hi>Galuanes</hi> was of gentle heart and a good Knight, deſirous among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reach the top of honor, yet of ſimple habilitie, as you haue heard before: now the enterpriſe of theſe twaine thus concluded, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had obtained licence of the King, they went on boord with their horſe &amp; armour, ech one like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Squire atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding on him. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wind at wil, in ſhort time they landed at <hi>Briſtow,</hi> where they made no long aboad, but riding through a Forreſt, they met a Damoſell who dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of them, if that way would conduct her to the Rock of <hi>Galteres.</hi> No, quoth they, but tell vs Damoſell why you trauaile thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? To ſee if I can finde the good Knight, ſayd ſhee, who knoweth how to remedy a griefe I endure at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. You abuſe your ſelfe Damoſell, anſwered <hi>Agraies,</hi> for at the Rock you demanded, you
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7179:58"/>
ſhal finde no other Knight then the great Gyant <hi>Albadan,</hi> to whom if you bring any cauſe of ſorow, he wil quickly double it on your own head. If you knew ſo much as I doe, quoth the Damoſell, you would not imagine me to be abuſed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Knight I aske for, hath vanquiſhed the Gyant, and killed him in battaile hand to hand. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me virgin, replied <hi>Galu anes,</hi> you tell vs matter of great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, in reſpect neuer any Knight dealt alone with a Giant, vnleſſe it was King <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who combated with one, himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed, and the Giant naked, which was the cauſe of his death; and yet this attempt of the King, is thought the greateſt ſtratageme that euer was heard of: then ſound not your ſpeeches, to any likely-hood, for this Gyant ſurpaſſeth all other in ſtrength &amp; cruelty. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, anſwered the Damoſell, the Knight I ſpeake of hath done no leſſe then I told ye: wherewith ſhe rehearſed the whole manner thereof; they reputing it ſtrange, and almoſt incredible: which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Agraies</hi> to aske her, if ſhe knew the Knights name. His name (quoth ſhe) is <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſon to King <hi>Perton</hi> of <hi>Gaule.</hi> Ah Lady, ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies,</hi> you declare the only newes of the world to content me withal, naming my Cofin, who more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly was reputed dead then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Hereupon he reported to <hi>Galuanes,</hi> what he had heard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Galaor,</hi> how he was taken away by the Gyant, and till this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he neuer heard of him. By my faith, anſwered <hi>Galuanes,</hi> the life of him and his brother is miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and their beginning of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie ſo famous, as I thinke their like is not to be found through the world; but Damoſell, what would you haue with that Knight? My Lord, quoth ſhe, I ſeeke his ayde on the behalfe of a Damoſell, who is impriſoned by the accuſation of a Dwarffe, the moſt villainous creature that euer was born: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhe added the whole diſcourſe of <hi>Galaor</hi> and the Dwarffe, as hath beene already declared to you, yet ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealed the louely pranck of <hi>Aldena.</hi> And becauſe Sir, ſayde ſhe, the Damoſell will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme what the Dwarffe hath auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, the Duke of <hi>Briſtoya</hi> hath ſworne, that within ten dayes ſhe ſhall be burned aliue: which is an occaſion of great griefe to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ladyes, doubting leaſt ſhee through feare of death will accuſe ſome of them, and tell withall to what end <hi>Galaor</hi> came into the Dukes Caſtle: more-ouer, of the ten dayes, foure are already expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Seeing it falleth out ſo, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Agraies,</hi> you neede tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile no further, for we will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what <hi>Galaor</hi> ſhould doe, if not in ſtrength, yet in good will, and therefore be you our guide to the place. The Damoſel turned her haqueney, and led them with ſuch ſpeede to the Dukes Caſtle, that they arriued there the day before the execution ſhould be. Now was the Duke ſet down to dinner, when the two Knights entring the great hall, humbly ſaluted him, &amp; when he ſaw them, he requeſted they would ſit downe to dinner with him: but they anſwered, that hee ſhould preſently know the cauſe of their comming, where-upon, <hi>Galuanes</hi> thus began. My Lord, you detaine a Damoſell priſoner, by the falſe and diſloyall accuſation of a traiterous Dwarffe; we deſire that ſhe may be deliuered ſeeing ſhe hath no way miſ-done: and if it be needfull to proue her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7179:58"/>
by battaile, let come two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to maintaine the quarrell, for we are ready as her defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders. Wel haue you ſayd, replyed the Duke: and calling for the Dwarffe, thus ſpake to him. What anſwereſt thou to theſe Knights challenge, who ſay that falſely thou haſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me to impriſon the Damoſell, and will proue it againſt thee in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen battaile? it behoueth thee to find ſome defence for thy ſelfe. For that I am not to ſeek my Lord, quoth the Dwarffe, I haue ſuch on my behalfe, who ſhall make known the truth of what I haue ſaid. Here-with he called a frollick Knight his Nephew, ſo like him in pitch and proportion, as one would haue thought he had no other father, to him he ſayd. I pray ye Nephew maintain my quarrell againſt theſe two Knights. Scarſe had he thus ſpoken, but his Nephew returned this anſwer to <hi>Galuanes</hi> and his companion. Well Gentlemen, what will you ſay againſt this loyal Dwarffe, who was ſo iniured by the Knight the falſe Damoſell brought hither? It may be one of you is the man I ſpeake off: but whether it be or no, I will proue in Combate he dealt villainouſly, &amp; the Damoſell ought to dy, becauſe ſhe brought him into my Lord the Dukes Chamber. <hi>Agraies</hi> who found himſelfe moſt touched in his owne conceite, ſtepped forth with this anſwer. In ſooth, neither of vs is the man, albeit we deſire to imitate his vertues, but wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch he hath done no wrong, &amp; if the Duke pleaſe, this difference ſhall be ſoone decided: for on his behalfe will I maintaine, that the damoſel ought to be deliuered, &amp; the Dwarfe in her ſtead burned as a traiterous villaine. I iuſtifie the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, replied the Dwarffes Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion: then calling for his armour; full ſoone was he mounted on a gentle Courſer, and turning to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> who preſented him the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare, thus ſpake. Would God Knight thou wert the man by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this quarrell bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, too high a price ſhould I ſet on thy folly. We ſhall quickly ſea; quoth <hi>Agraies,</hi> what thou canſt doe, but I am aſſured if he were preſent, he would make no account of two ſuch braggers as thou art, how iuſt or vniuſt the cauſe were on his ſide, by greater reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then do I leaue thee to iudge, how notably he would handle thes in this, conſiſting on truth and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. While theſe menaces thus paſſe on either ſide, the Duke ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not from the table till dinner was done, when ſeeing the Knights prepared to execute their ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he conducted them with a braue company of Gentlemen, to the place apointed to end ſuch controuerſies, where all accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ceremonies being obſerued, the Duke thus ſpake to <hi>Agraies.</hi> Performe the vttermoſt of your habilitie, yet ſhall not the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel be deliuered: for to the Dwarffe hath not been offered iniury alone, but to ſuch beſide as are of higher reckoning then your ſelfe. My Lord, quoth <hi>Agraies,</hi> you cauſed her to be apprehended only by his falſe accuſation, and he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued your iudgement with a lye: wherefore if my for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7179:59"/>
as they were both laide along on the ground: yet quickly they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered themſelues, and vnſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing their weapons, deliuered fierce and cruell ſtrokes to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; their Swordes being verie ſharpe, the Knights valiant and haurily diſpoſed, by means where-of, their Armour, Helmets and ſheeldes, were in ſhort time made of ſlender reſiſtance: yet <hi>Galuanes</hi> well ſaw, how his Nephew had ſtil the better of his enemy; if then he had before eſteemed him a good Knight, farre greater reaſon had he ſo to doe: notwithſtanding, hee was ſo hot and vigorous, as often-times he ſeemed out of breath, which made euery one imagine (regarding his violence) that hee could not long endure. But in him it proued farre otherwiſe, for the longer the Combate endured, his courage and ſtrength the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, by reaſon whereof he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Conquerour, as ſhall hereafter be declared. The Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to the Dwarffe found him-ſelfe ſo hardly handled, as he drew back a little, thus ſpeaking to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies.</hi> Me thinkes Sir Knight wee haue made proofe enough, of what we are able to performe in theſe affaires, wherefore I am of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that he whoſe quarrell I vndertake, &amp; the other for whom you entred fight, are not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

Theſe angry wordes did ſomewhat eleuate the Dwarffes Knights courage, but he had loſt ſo much bloud, that he was no longer able to holde out; by meanes whereof <hi>Agraies</hi> took his pleaſure on him, becauſe the other did nothing but defend his ſtrokes: which when the Duke beheld, by reaſon he fauoured him, he was highly diſpleaſed, and to ſhun the ſight of his death, departed toward his Caſtle, ſwearing thence-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to worke reuenge for him on all Knights errant, by doing them all the ſhame he could poſſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe. He being in this furie ſpake ſo loude, as <hi>Galuanes</hi> ouerheard him, wherefore he thus anſwered: Duke thou dooſt enterpriſe a great war, eſpecially againſt ſuch as are known to more worthy Lords the thou art, ſeeking thus to ſmother vp the blame of others. As thus he contended with the Duke, the Dwarffes champion fell at <hi>Agraies</hi> feete, who immediatly ſnatching off his Helmes, caught him by the head, giuing him many blowes with the hilts of his Sword on the face, ſaying: Confeſſe the diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Dwarffe, otherwiſe thy life is at an end. Ah gentle Knight, quoth he, giue me my life, for I truely confeſſe, that hee who you ſight for is vertuous and loyall, &amp; promiſe withall to gaine the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels releaſe from impriſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment: but for Gods ſake I deſire ye, let me not reprooue the Dwariffe mine Vnckle with treaſon.

                  <p>All this while the Duke heard none of theſe words, becauſe hee was gone ſomewhat further off: but <hi>Galuanes</hi> laid hold on his horſe bridle, ſaying: By God (Duke) you ſhall not departe hence, vntill you haue ſeene he extreamity of your Champion: for he is either dead or vanquiſhed; what anſwer then make ye concerning the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels right, &amp; the treacherous iniury offered her by the Dwarfe? What? ſaide the Duke, thinkeſt thou I will breake mine oath, or do any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then I haue determined? I know not, quoth <hi>Galuanes,</hi> what concluſion you haue appointed. Mary this, replied the duke, that ſhe ſhalbe to morrow morning burn'd, if ſhe tell not what moued her, to cauſe the Knight come hither who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe conducted. Why? quoth <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanes,</hi> will ye not then deliuer her? No, ſaid the Duke, and if thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide not for thy ſpeedy departure out of my Country, thou ſhalt well know that thou haſt diſpleaſed me. Is it true? anſwered <hi>Galuanes,</hi> doe ye threaten me contrarie to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and will not diſcharge the Damoſell ſo honourably iuſtified? By heauen henceforth I deſie thee, as well on mine own behalfe, as all other Knights errant whatſoeuer.

So went the Duke into his Caſtle, and <hi>Galuanes</hi> returned in an exceeding chafe to <hi>Agraies,</hi> but reioycing at his Nephewes glorious victory, he ſomewhat quallified his angry choller: yet did he tel him all the Dukes mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and what defiance had paſſed on either ſide, wherewith <hi>Agraies</hi> was very much moued, chiefely for the wrong he threatned to the Damoſell; whereupon he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.

You know Nephew, that I haue defied the Duke, in reſpect of the iniurie he offered vs: but if I might giue aduiſe, I would thinke it good for vs, to ambuſh our ſelues a while in this wood, where we may eaſily take him or ſome of his. I promiſe ye, ſaide <hi>Agaies,</hi> I like well your counſell: wherefore without paſſing any further, they made choyce of a little thicket, where they alighted, ſending their Squires to the Towne to prouide them victuals.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the Duke (as you haue heard) being with-drawn to his Caſtle, grewe into ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt the Damoſel, as he thought preſently to ſend her to the fire: where-upon he called for her, &amp; willed her for to haue minde of her ſoule, becauſe the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhee ſhould bee burned, if quickly ſhe declared not the truth of the Knight: but all theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings could not drawe one word from her.

My Lord, quoth ſhee, you may appoint what you thinke good; but if I die in this manner, it will be againſt all law and reaſon. Preſently he committed her to two Sergeants at Armes, accompanied with ten Knights well prouided for their defence: and for the more ſuretie that ſhee ſhould not be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued, himſelfe mounted in perſon on a goodly great horſe; then lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the towne, along they ride thorow the fieldes by the Forreſt ſide, and being come to the place prepared for execution, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded foorth-with ſhe ſhould be throwne into the fire, ſaying: Let the ſtubborne Strumpet die in her obſtinacie. But <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Galua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> being ready armed to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their fortune, diſcerned when the troupe came from the towne toward the forreſt; wherefore with-out longer tarying, (hauing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen expreſſe charge to one of their Squires, to haue a ſpeciall care of the Damoſels ſafety) flyly left their ambuſh, beholding the poore mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den readie for the fire; when ſhee perceiuing her preſent daunger, cryed to the Duke, that ſhe would tell what he deſired, onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the time of her death.

At theſe words were all the Dukes Knights greatly aſtoniſhed, yet prepared they for their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, where-upon began between them a fierce and cruel fight. Now though <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Galuanes</hi> were alone againſt ſo many, yet did they ſo brauely behaue themſelues, as at the firſt on-ſet they quailed the greater part of them, before they could deuiſe which way to turne themſelues: whereat the Duke was ſo amazed, that fearing his owne death was neere at hand, he with-drew himſelfe behind his men; yet <hi>Galuanes</hi> perceiued it, wherefore he cryed to him: Trayterous Duke, This day thou beginneſt to feele the warre thou didſt enterpriſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Knights errant: then ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the preaſſe, hee min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to charge the Duke, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred aſide, willing his Knights to kill their enemies horſes, which they on foote might eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe.

But <hi>Galuanes</hi> eſpyed them ere they came neere, and ſhewed them to his Nephew <hi>Agraies,</hi> who hee thought was ouer-wearyed with the laſt aſſault, which made him ſay: Wee already haue felt what theſe villaines can doe, but now muſt we warily defend our ſelues, that we may be no more followed in this ſort. I know the Duke to be he comes formoſt, if good hap befall vs, I hope he ſhall haue his payment firſt of all: be now (good Nephew) mindfull of your wonted courage, hauing paſſed through greater dangers then this can bee.

                     </gap> adame, that the King had this knight likewiſe, to attend on his ſeruice. Certes, quoth ſhee, I would it might be ſo if it were poſſible. If you will grant me leaue, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> to goe finde him, I haue no doubt of bringing him hither: otherwiſe I know you ſhall hardly ſee him, till hee haue made himſelfe knowne in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places. You doe very much for the king, quoth ſhe, if hee doe come; neuertheleſſe, I referre it to your owne diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Amadis</hi> obtained licence to depart, which hee did very early the next Morning, hauing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company then <hi>Gandalin;</hi> and ſpending moſt part of the day ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding through the Forreſt, he ſaw a Lady come toward him, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with two Damoſels and foure Squires: who weeping very grieuouſly, conducted a knight in a Litter, whereat <hi>Amadis</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed, demaunded what moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them to be ſo ſorrowfull, and what he was they had in the Litter. He is, quoth the Ladie, the onely cauſe of my care and penſiueneſſe, my Lord and Husband, who is wounded in ſuch ſort as I feare his death. <hi>Amadis</hi> aduanced him-ſelfe to behold the man, and lifting vp the couerture of the Litter, ſaw a Knight lye there, of goodly perſonage: but of his face hee could make no iudgement, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it was cruelly cut and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled; whereupon hee called to him, ſaying. My friend, who hath thus wronged thee? yet did the Knight make no anſwere; which made him goe to the Lady againe, and aske her the queſtion. Gentle Sir, quoth ſhee, a knight that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth a Bridge not farre hence, did it, who as we paſſed by ſayd to my Lord, how hee muſt ſweare whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were of king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> court or no: which made my husband demand why he would know. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſaid the knight, no friend of his ſhall paſſe here, but I will kill him. What is the occaſion of your hatred, replyed my husband? I wiſh ſo much ill, quoth the knight, to that vngracious king, as I would gladly haue him in my power, to take vengeance on him at my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: and in deſpight of him, hence-foorth ſhall I ſlay all ſuch as are belonging to him. Becauſe he kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth a knight that killed the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7179:62"/>
                     <hi>Daodan,</hi> for whoſe ſake I meane to deale in ſuch ſort, as the king and his wel-willers ſhall receiue by me infinite diſpleaſures and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours. When my husband heard him, as one agreeued at his villainous ſpeeches, he anſwered. Know thou that I am one of his Court, &amp; his vowed ſeruant, who neither for thee or any other will deny him. Highly diſpleaſed was the knight of the Bridge with this anſwere, and without any more wordes charged my husband, ſo that betweene them grew a cruell combate: but in the end, my Lord was brought into this hard extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and farre more worſe in the knights opinion; for hee reputed him to be ſlaine out-right, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vs within three dayes to carry him before king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight him withall. Lady, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> I pray you lend me one of your Squires, who can ſhew me the knight when I come where he is: for ſeeing your husband hath been ſo wronged for my ſake, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofeth me (more then any other) to reuenge the ſame. What? ſaid the Lady, are you hee for whoſe cauſe he ſo hateth the king? Yea verily, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> and if my hap prooue ſo good, hee ſhall neuer heereafter abuſe any other. Ah, gentle Knight, quoth ſhee, I will pray for your proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. Afterward ſhee gaue him one of her Squires, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to GOD, rode on with her husband; and <hi>Amadis</hi> ne-uer ſtayed till hee came to the Bridge, where hee ſawe the knight playing at Tables with another: but quickly leauing his paſtime, being ready armed, hee mounted on horſe backe, calling for <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> in this manner. Holla, holla Sirra, I forbid ye to paſſe any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till yee haue ſworne. What ſhall I ſweare? anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> Whether thou be of king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, or no, ſaid the Knight: for if thou belong to him, heere muſt thou leaue thy head behinde thee. It is a queſtion, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> if thou canſt doe ſo much: but I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee, I belong to the Queene his wife, euer ſince not long agoe. Since when? replyed the knight. ſince a diſinherited Lady, ſayd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> came hither for her right. But thou art not hee, quoth the knight, that foughteſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate for her? I am the man, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> who wonne her peace. By my head, ſaid the knight, now ſhalt thou looſe thine, if I can; for thou didſt kill the onely honour of my linage. I killed him not, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> but made him diſcharge her of his outragious demand, and afterward he became a murtherer of himſelfe. All this cannot profit thee, quoth the knight, for by thee and no other he dyed: now for his ſake, ſhalt thou looſe thy life. Heereupon they gaue the ſpurres to their horſes, and breaking their Lances brauely, met ſo furiouſly with their bodies, as the knight of the Bridge was thrown to the ground; whereof he was not a little aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: but by reaſon the helmet of <hi>Amadis</hi> was vnlaced in the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, while hee amended it, the knight had leiſure to mount him-ſelfe againe, and to giue his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie two or three ſtrokes with the ſword, before he had time to draw out his. All which afterward hee very well requited; for ſtriking full at his head, hee brake away the skirts of his helmet, and redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his blow, mette ſo directly with his necke, as his head hung downe behinde his ſhoulders, his
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7179:63"/>
ſoule paſſing to the Author of his pride and cruelty. When his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of the bridge ſawe him thus ſlaine, they truſted to their heeles, yet <hi>Amadis</hi> would not follow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but returned to the Squire that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him thither: willing him to make haſte to his Lady, and let her vnderſtand how he had reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her husbands iniurie: which he immediately did, not ſparing the worthy attaints at Sword and Launce, which he had ſeene <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> beſtow on the Knight of the bridge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> hauing there no more to do, iſſuing forth of the Forreſt, entred on a large &amp; goodly plaine, brauely beautified with violets, ſweete hearbs, and all other deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of natures tapiſtrie, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently prouoked the remembrance of his <hi>Oriana:</hi> riding on in diuers amorous thoughts, he ſaw come toward him an euill fauoured Dwarffe, on a ſimple Palfrey, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he called to know from whence he came. My Lord, quoth the dwarfe, I come from the houſe of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Claire.</hi> Haſt thou not ſeene a young Knight, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Galaor?</hi> No truely, anſwered the Dwarffe, but I know where (within three dayes) I can ſhew you the beſt Knight that euer bare Armes in theſe parts. When <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> heard this, thinking hee had meant his brother, he ſayd: I pray thee my friend conduct me to the place where I may ſee him. With all my heart, replied the Dwarffe, on condition you will graunt me one requeſt, and goe with me whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhall guide ye. The great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he had to finde his brother, made him ſoone conſent. Come with me then, quoth the Dwarffe, and I will bring ye where you ſhall behold the good Knight. So rode they on till darke night ouertooke them, which the Dwarffe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, he ſayd to <hi>Amadis,</hi> My Lord, hard by is a Caſtle where we may lodge this night, for there is a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy who will friendly welcome vs. Thither they rode, and had kinde entertainment, when ſupper being ended, <hi>Amadis</hi> was brought to lodge in a ſumptuous bed: but he could take no reſt, his thoughts ſo hammered on the perfection of his miſtreſſe. And taking leaue the next morning of their friendly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſſe, continued on their iourney till about mid-day, when they ſaw two Knights fighting againſt one, then <hi>Amadis</hi> approching to them, ſaid: Gentlemen, may it pleaſe ye to pauſe a while, and tell mee on what occaſion your quarrell ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth? At theſe words they ceaſed, &amp; one of the two thus replied: It is becauſe this Knight maintaineth, that he alone is as able as we two together, to bring a hauty enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe to end. In ſooth, ſayd <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> your difference is very ſlender, for the bounty of the one dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth no iot of the other. The Knights perceiuing he ſpake the truth, ended their ſtrife, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Amadis,</hi> if hee knew the Knight in King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bated for the iniured wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, whereby the good Knight <hi>Dardan</hi> was ſlaine. Why aske ye? quoth <hi>Amadis.</hi> Becauſe, ſaid the Knights, we would gladly meete with him. I know not, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> whether your meaning be good or bad, yet is it not long ſince I ſaw him in the Court of King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> Hauing ſo ſayd, he rode on his way, when the three Knights hauing conferred a little together, they began to gallop after him: &amp; he no ſooner heard them, but tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe; then doubting they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

ſome harme to him, he claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on his Helmet and his Shield, yet had he no Lance, nor they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Alas my Lord, quoth the Dwarffe, what will ye doe? conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you not they be three, and you alone? What matters that? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> if they aſſayle me without reaſon why; by good right I muſt aſſay for mine owne defence.</p>
                  <p>On theſe ſpeeches, they came to him in this manner. Sir knight, we would demaund one thing of you, which we deſire ye not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, otherwiſe you may not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcape vs. The ſooner ſhall I grant it, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> if it bee reaſonable.

I am hee, albeit I would haue you thinke, that I doe not ſo ſoone fulfil your requeſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of adding any praiſe to my ſelfe. When the knights heard him, they cryed altogether: Ah traytour, thou dyeſt; and drawing their ſwords ſet violently vpon him. <hi>Amadis</hi> offended to ſee him-ſelfe thus aſſailed, by them whom ere-while he had ſo friendly paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: reſiſted them with ſuch reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute courage, as at the firſt ſtroke he ſmote one of their armes from the body, the griefe whereof made him fall beſide his horſe: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d alſo felt his ſword ſo peizant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that hee cleft his head to the very teeth, and ſent to keepe his fellow company. When the third beheld their bad ſucceſſe, hee put the ſpurres to his horſe and got him away, but <hi>Amadis</hi> being not ſo well mounted, let him eſcape, returning to <hi>Gandalin</hi> and the Dwarffe, who thus ſpake.

Theſe words he vſed, as well for the braue Chiualrie he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Angriote,</hi> as alſo the great honeſtie he ſhewed to the Lady in his poſſeſſion: whereupon <hi>Angri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> returned this anſwer. It is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I ſhould yeeld myſelfe to the beſt Knight in the world, and the like all other to doe that beare armes: Beleeue me then gentle Knight, I not ſo much ſorrow for my foyle, as the wrackfull chance threatned to me, by looſing this day the onely thing in the world I moſt loue. That ſhall you not, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> if I can helpe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, the Lady ſhould ſhew her ſelfe very ingratefull, if ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not your honorable paines in her defence, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but ſhe will requite ye with the good you haue deſerued. As for me, I promiſe ye to imploy my vttermoſt hability, in cauſing her conſent thereto, ſo ſoone as I ſhall returne from a ſearch I haue now in hand. My Lord, ſayd <hi>Angriote,</hi> in what place may I hereafter finde you? In the Court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> where (by Gods helpe) I meane ſhortly to be. So tooke he leaue of <hi>Angriote,</hi> who gladly would haue had him in his Caſtle, but he might not be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of his iourney.</p>
                  <p>Thus doth <hi>Amadis</hi> followe the Dwarfe, who guided him fiue daies without any aduenture, ſhewing him at length a meruailous ſtrong and pleaſant Caſtle, ſaying: Sir, within yonder hold you muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the promiſe you made me. And I will doe it for thee, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis,</hi> if it confiſt in my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. I am in good hope thereof, quoth the Dwarffe, in reſpect I haue ſeene ſome proofe of your fortune: but know ye Sir how the place is named? No verily, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> for till now I was neuer in this Country: It is called <hi>Valderin,</hi> replied the Dwarffe: and thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing, they came neere the Caſtle, when the Dwarffe willed him to take his Armes. Why? ſaide <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> ſhall we haue any ſuch neede? Yea mary, quoth the Dwarffe, for they ſuffer none to come forth that enter ſo lightly. <hi>Amadis</hi> buckled on his helmet, riding in before, the Dwarffe and <hi>Gandalin</hi> following after, then looking on euery ſide they could ſee no creature. This place ſayd <hi>Amadis</hi> is not inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, where is the requeſt thou ſaidſt I ſhould do for thee? Credit me Sit, ſayd the Dwarffe, I haue ſome-time ſeene heere a moſt braue Knight, and the ſtrongeſt in Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie that euer I ſaw, who in that porch killed two Knights, one of them being my maiſter, him hee put to death very cruelly, without regard of fauour or mercy: In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge whereof, I would deſire that traytors head, which I haue long failed in obtaining, becauſe all ſuch as I brought hither, haue loſt their liues or remaine here in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity. Thou doeſt the part of a loyall ſeruant, anſwered <hi>Amadis:</hi> yet oughteſt thou to bring no Knight hither, before thou tell him againſt whom he ſhall fight. My Lord, quoth the Dwarffe, the man is knowne well enough, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for one of the beſt Knights in the world: therefore when I haue named him, I could not meet with any ſo hardy as to reuenge my cauſe. Belike then thou knoweſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7179:65"/>
his name, ſaid <hi>Amadis.</hi> Yea my Lord, replied the Dwarffe, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelfe <hi>Arcalaus</hi> the enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Amadis</hi> hereupon went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in, looking round about if hee might ſee any body: but all was in vaine, wherefore to reſt his horſe, he ſtaied there till euening, ſaying to the Dwarffe. What wilt thou I ſhall doe now it is ſo late? Alas my Lord, quoth he, the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo neere at hand, me thinkes it were good wee departed hence. Nay truſt me, anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> I will not budge hence till the knight come, or ſome other that can tell me tidings of him. But I dare not tarry, ſayd the Dwarffe, leaſt <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> chance to know me, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine I practiſe the meanes of his death. Yet ſhalt thou beare me co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> as I will not excuſe my ſelfe from the promiſe I haue made thee. As thus they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muned, <hi>Amadis</hi> eſpied a Court ſomewhat more backward, where-into he entred and found no body: but he ſaw a darke place vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and certaine ſteps leading into the earth <hi>Gandalin</hi> got holde on the Dwarffe, who would haue run away, and <hi>Amadis</hi> tooke great pleaſure to beholde his trembling, ſpeaking thus merily to him. Feare not tall fellow, but let vs go down theſe ſtaires, to ſee who is beneath. My Lord; quoth the Dwarffe, for Gods ſake ſpare me, nothing in the world can make mee goe into ſuch a fearefull place. If thou goe hence, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> how wilt thou enioy the thing I promiſed thee, or know that I do my indeuour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? Ah Sir, quoth he, I acquite you, and holde my ſelfe fully, ſatisfied. But ſo do not I, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> becauſe hereafter thou ſhalt not ſay I brake my promiſ. On my faith Sir, ſayd the Dwarffe, I freely diſcharge ye, and if you pleaſe to let me go, I will tarry for you in the way as we came hither. Get thee gone then, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> for heere will I abide till to morrow morning attending the Knight.</p>
                  <p>In this manner the poore dwarfe eſcaped thence, and <hi>Amadis</hi> went downe the ſtaires, comming into a plaine place ſo darke, that hee could not imagine where he was: yet he proceeded on, and by gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping on a wall felt a barre of iron, whereat hung a key which he took, opening therewith a chaine that locked a port-cullis, then heard he a lamentable voyce thus complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Ah God, how long ſhall we remaine in this miſerie? ſweete death why ſtayeſt thou from ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring vs, who call to thee as out laſt refuge? Soone after the voyce ceaſed, which made him holde on his way, and enter a vault hauing his ſword and Shield ready: then paſſing further, he came into a great Pallace, at the entrance whereof hung a lampe burning, &amp; ſixe men laide along aſleepe, with their Shields and Hatchets lying by them, the beſt of which he took himſelfe. They not awaking hee went on by them, and ſoone after heard another grieuous lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in this manner. Ah God full of pitty and mercy, ſend death if it pleaſe thee to deliuer vs from this hell. Now was <hi>Amadis</hi> in worſe caſe then before, for one of the ſixe Souldiers ſuddenly awaking, ſayd to his fellow: Ariſe, take them rods and make that curſed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſing another kinde of ſong; who hath thus diſturbed vs in our ſleepe. Mary and I ſhall, anſwered the other: ſo hee aroſe and tooke the rods, but as he wont, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſee <hi>Amadis</hi> before him, whereat he was ſomewhat affraid,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7179:66"/>
yet to be better aſſured, he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who is there? I, quoth <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi> What art thou? ſaid the other. I am, quoth he, a ſtrange Knight. Who brought thee hither, ſayde the Souldier, without any licence? No body, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> but my ſelfe alone. The worſe for thee, replied the Souldier, now muſt thou be encloſed among theſe infortunate people, who cry as thou heareſt. Then ſtepping back, he ſhut the dore againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> and waking his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſaid. My friends I haue found a ſtrange knight, who to his harme hath entred on his good will. Let me talke with him, anſwered the Iaylor, and if I lodge him not worſe then the reſt, then blame me. So taking his hatchet and Shield; he came to <hi>Amadis</hi> with theſe words. Caitife, if thou wilt not die, throw downe thy weapons, leaſt with my hatchet I ſlice thy fleſh, &amp; make carbonadoes of it. Very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry was <hi>Amadis</hi> to be thus threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, wherefore he returned this anſwer. Slender is thy reaſon in thinking to feare me with thy words, but the Deuils ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright thee a great deale more: for I will make them a preſent with thy ſoule, which ſo long hath giuen power to thy wicked body in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euill. Preſently they ſmote at each other with their hatchets, the iaylor deliuering his ſtroke on the helmet of <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſo that it entred very far therein, &amp; <hi>Amadis</hi> cutting through the iaylors Shield, enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to throw both it and his hatchet downe to ſtand to the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defence of his ſword: which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured not long likewiſe, wherefore he minded to grapple <hi>Amadis</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the body, becauſe he was a man of maruailous ſtrength, yet could he not do ſo much as hee meant, in reſpect <hi>Amadis</hi> was a Knight both ſtiffe and ſturdy. Ne-uertheleſſe, the iaylor griped him very cruelly, till the Prince gaue him ſuch a blow on the face, as brake his iaw bones, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling him to fall downe amazed, <hi>Amadis</hi> had the meane to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his promiſe, ſeperating with his ſword the body from the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>The other Souldiours that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held this fight, not thinking the iaylor was dead indeede, cryed to <hi>Amadis:</hi> how on perill of his life he ſhould not kill him, leaſt they likewiſe ſhould ſend him after. I know not, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> what may become of me, but I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine he is ſafe enough for doing any more harme: herewith hee drew his ſword, and taking vp his hatchet againe, marched toward them that came againſt him, who charged him very ſharpe and roughly: yet the firſt he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with, followed the iaylor, ſo did the ſecond, and the fourth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmitten on his knees to the ground, had dyed, but he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for mercy, the other twaine bearing him company in the ſame ſuite. Caſt downe your weapons, ſayd <hi>Amadis</hi> and ſhew mee them that complained ſo wofully: which they did, guiding him the way to the captiues, when <hi>Amadis</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring another voice ſomewhat neer him, demanded what he was. My Lord, replied the Souldier, it is a Lady in extreame anguiſh. Open the dore, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> that I may ſee her. Then one of them ran where the iaylor lay dead, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king two keyes from his girdle, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the dungeon where the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was encloſed: but ſhe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the iaylor entred, cryed. Alas man, take pitie on me, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe me with no more torments.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7179:66"/>
Ah King, quoth ſhe, breathing forth a bitter ſigh: hard was my lot to be beloued of thee, ſeeing I buy my affection ſo deerely. Her grieuous moanes moued ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation in <hi>Amadis,</hi> as the teares trickled downe his cheekes, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her this anſwer. Lady, I am not the iaylor that locked you heere, but the man who meanes to deliuer you hence if I can, a ſtrange Knight, ſeeking my fortune euery where. Alas my Lord, ſayde ſhe, what is become of the iaylor and his companions? He and ſome of them, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> are ſent to hell to looke their copeſ-mates: then one of the Souldiers hauing brought a light, the Prince ſaw how the Lady was tied by the neck with a great chaine, which had ſo worne &amp; diſployed her garments, as the naked fleſh appeared in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, and when ſhe beheld that <hi>Amadis</hi> pittied her, ſhee thus ſpake. Although (my Lord) I am at this preſent ſequeſtred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al my lifehood, yet time hath been, when I was the wealthy daughter to a King, and for a King you finde me in this miſery. Lady, quoth <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> it behooueth you to embrace patience, theſe are but the mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of fortune, which no one is able to preuent or eſcape: and if the man for whom you haue thus ſuffered, be of any account, or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you, I am ſure he will conuert right ſoone this poore eſtate into rich aboundance, and remunerate your long ſorrowes with ioy and gladnes. So he cauſed the chaine to be taken from her neck, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding garments to be brought and put about her: wherefore hee that brought the lights, ran for a ſcarlet mantle, which <hi>Arcalaus</hi> not long before gaue the iaylor, and caſt it about the Ladies ſhoulders.

heard before. Being thus ouer-come with griefe, hee heard one crie, wherefore hee ran which way he thought beſt, and found the Dwarffe (that parted from him the night before) hanging by one leg on high at a great piece of wood, hauing a fire vnderneath him full of filthy ſtinking ſauours: &amp; neere him he eſpied <hi>Gandalin</hi> tied to a tree, toward whom hee was going to vnbinde him, but hee ſaw the Dwarffe had greateſt need of help, wherefore he cut the cords in twaine that held him vp, catching him in his armes to ſet him on his feete, afterward he vnlooſed <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> ſaying: In ſooth my friend, whoſoeuer entreated thee thus, made little reckoning of thy good deſerts. Now becauſe he would deliuer the other priſoners, he met the Lady comming forth of the Caſtle, as he returned back againe, but going on, he found the gates faſt ſhut againſt him: whereupon he ſtaied til day light in a corner of the Court, ſitting downe by the Lady, accompanied with two of the Souldiers, the Dwarffe and <hi>Gandalin.</hi> And as they communed together, <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſhewed the Prince a place where-into he ſaw a horſe led, which <hi>Amadis</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſee, came to the dore and found it ſhut, but he ran ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt it with his foote, that he made it fly open, finding the horſe there ready ſadled and bridled, whereon he mounted, attending the day and ſight of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> who he knew was already arriued at the Caſtle, by matters he heard of <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> and the Dwarffe. In meane while he conferred with the Lady, demanding what the King was ſhe loued ſo deerly, and for whom ſhe had ſuſtained ſuch iniury. Worthy Lord, quoth ſhe, <hi>Arcalaus</hi> getting intelligence, of the Princes affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion toward me whom I loue ſo loyally, this diueliſh enchanter being his mortall enemy: thought he could be no better reuenged on him, then by depriuing me of his preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, imagining the griefe here-of would be greater to him then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other. Being thus perſwaded, he ſtole me away, at what time I was with many great perſonages, who were not able to giue me any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor, by reaſon of the traiterous vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous ſorceries: for they could not deuiſe what was become of me, becauſe a wonderfull darke cloud enuironed me, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them from following mee to this place, ſince when, I neuer ſaw light till now you brought mee forth. The diſloyall wretch ſaid by the way as he brought me, that he would be reuenged on my loue &amp; my ſelfe by theſe meanes: I poore ſoule enduring the torments, and my loue the griefe of my abſence, yet ignorant where. Madame, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> I pray ye name the man you ſpake of. It is King <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Norwales,</hi> anſwered the Lady, whom it may be you know. I know him right well, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> for he is one whom I deerly loue, and now do I leſſe pitty your ſufferings then before: becauſe they haue bin for one of the beſt men in the world, who will ſo well recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence them, as by rendring you incomparable ioy, your loue and honor ſhall both be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>While thus they communed together, faire day appeared, when <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaw a Knight leaning in a window, who thus demanded.

Now you muſt note that this <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> was one of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyeſt Knights in the world, yet no Gyant, wherefore when <hi>Amadis</hi> behelde him of ſuch ſtature, hee doubted not of his great force and ſtrength. <hi>Arcalaus</hi> perceiuing hee eyed him ſo much, dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded what moued him ſo to doe? I imagine, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> that according to thy large proportion, thou ſhouldeſt be a man of exquiſite Chiualrie: but thy peruerſe and humaine actions are a foule ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh thereto. Now truſt me ſayde <hi>Arcalaus</hi> I thinke my ſelfe highly beholding to fortune, who hath brought thee hither to make mee ſuch a ſmooth ſormon: but all this will not helpe thee, therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy ſelfe. So charging their Launces, they brake ſo brauely on their Shields, as the ſhiuers flewe vp into the aire, and with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence met their horſes and bodies, that they were both laide along on the ground. Quickly they aroſe, &amp; with their ſwordes began a bloudy combate, wherein deſire of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and hauty reſolution of vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable courage, made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a long time, till <hi>Arcalaus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring aſide, thus ſpake to <hi>Amadis.</hi> Knight, thou art in danger of death, and becauſe I know not who thou art, tell me, that when I haue ſlaine thee, I may yet commend thy boldnes in entring heere. My death, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> is in the hand of God whom I reuerence, and thine in the power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, who is weary of helping thee: and bequeatheth thy body to ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable miſchiefes, as a preſent periſhing of ſoule and altogether. But ſeeing thou wouldeſt ſo gladly know my name. I am commonly called <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> Knight to the Queene <hi>Briſana:</hi> let vs now then chat no longer but fall to the combate, for on my parte I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe no more reſting. <hi>Arcalaus</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing his Shield, came with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fury againſt <hi>Amadis,</hi> who knew full well how to welcome him: and ſuch eager ſtrokes paſt on either ſide, as their ſhields were ſcattered in pieces about them, &amp; likewiſe many plates of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Now was it about the third houre, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Arcalaus</hi> hauing ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned great loſſe of his bloud, was forced to ſend vp and down before his enemy, and ſeeing the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent death before his eyes, fled to that part of the Caſtle where he came out: yet <hi>Amadis</hi> by cloſe purſuit ſtill continued his feare, whereupon he ſtept into a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at the dore whereof ſtood a Lady beholding the combate, and he was no ſooner entred the roome, but he caught vp another ſwotd, turning his face to <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſaying. Enter this cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber to make an end of our combate. The open Court, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> is more ſpacious and conuenient. I will not come foorth, quoth <hi>Aro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What? ſaide <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> thinkeſt thou ſo ſlily to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape? ſo placing his ſhield before, he entred the chamber: but as hee lifted vp his ſword to ſtrike, he was depriued of ſtrength and the vſe of his members, ſo that hee fell to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7179:68"/>
the ground as he had beene dead. Yea mary, ſaid <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> this is the way to make thee dye as I deſired, ſleepe then till I wake thee. How ſay you Lady? quoth he to her that ſtoodby, am I not (in your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) well reuenged on him? Indeed ſaide ſhe, he is now altogether at your commandement. Preſently he vnarmed him, <hi>Amadis</hi> not fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any thing was done to him: afterward <hi>Arcalaus</hi> put on himſelfe the Princes Armour, thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the Lady. Madame, looke (on, perill of your life) that no one remoue him hence, vntill his ſoule haue forſaken his body: then hee intended to iourney to the court, where each one ſeeing him in the Armour of <hi>Amadis,</hi> might thinke he had ſlaine him.</p>
                  <p>But now the ſorrowfull Lady ſo lately deliuered from priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, made ſuch mone as would haue melted a heart of Adamant, and what <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalins</hi> countenance was, you may eaſily iudge: when <hi>Arcalaus</hi> ſawe the Lady lament, he ſayde. Dame, ſeeke ſome other to deliuer you from priſon, for I haue diſpatched your hardy Chamhion. Theſe wordes made <hi>Gandalin</hi> in ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpare, as he fell downe like one ſenceleſſe, and <hi>Arcalaus</hi> called the Lady to him in this manner. Come hither miſtreſſe, and you ſhall ſee him dead that durſt ſo boldely combate with me. When he had ſhewed him to her, he dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded if he were not now quiet enough, The comfortleſſe Lady ſeeing him in ſuch eſtate, wanted no teares to expreſſe the aboundance of her griefe, and withall: Ah God, quoth ſhe, how yrkſome will the reporte of his death be to many? then <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus</hi> calling his wife, ſayde. So ſo oue as this wretch is dead, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon this Lady where ſhe was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for I will go to the Court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and there declare how I combated with <hi>Amadis,</hi> by couenant, that the conquerour ſhould cut off the head of the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, and within fifteene daies following, to publiſh his victory openly in great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> By theſe meanes none ſhal quarrel with me about his death, and I ſhall obtain the greateſt glory in the world, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ouercome him that conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red euery one. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went he where he left <hi>Gandalin</hi> and the Dwarffe, commanding them to be locked vp in a priſon: but <hi>Gandalin</hi> who wiſhed death, thinking his maiſter was dead indeede, would not goe with him, deſiring ſome one to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Ah faire Ladies, beholde yee not the beauty of this braue Gentle-man, who in ſo young yeeres was the onely Knight in the world? miſ-hap attend on ſuch, who by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, in iurie men of vertue: O ſoueraigne creator, why dooſt thou ſuffet ſo bad minded people to liue?

Then one of the Ladyes ſo lately there arriued, tooke (out of a little caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket ſhe carried) a Booke, whereon ſhe began to reade, and diuers times another voyſe anſwered her. As thus ſhe continued her lecture, many other voyces were heard, as they imagined them more then an hundred: then came another book flying into the chamber, ſeeming as if the winde caryed it, and ſeeming downe at her feete that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

looke to the ſafetie of this noble woman till I returne. Comming fourth into the Court, it was a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to ſee how <hi>Arcalaus</hi> ſeruants fled his ſight: but <hi>Amadis</hi> let them run, and went to the darke vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe priſons which were filled with captiues.</p>
                  <p>Now to tel ye in what diſtreſſed manner they were, you muſt note, the place was a vault of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred toyſes long, yet no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one foote and a halfe in breadth, without aire or light, and (which was worſt of all) ſo ful of priſoners, as they could ſcantly ſtand one by another. <hi>Amadis</hi> called <hi>Gandalin,</hi> who being in a manner dead, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his maiſters voyce, began to tremble: yet thinking it was not he, becauſe he verily imagined him to be dead, entred into diuers doubts of himſelfe, whither hee dreamed, or was enhanted. All this while <hi>Amadis</hi> greatly grieued, becauſe <hi>Gandalin</hi> made no anſwer, wherefore he called aloud againe: <hi>Gandalin</hi> where art thou? why doſt thou make me trauaile ſo much? ſpeake I pray thee. When he ſaw (for all this) <hi>Gandalin</hi> anſwered not, he asked the other priſoners, if a Squire ſo lately brought in there, was dead or aliue: but the Dwarffe remembering the voyce of <hi>Amadis,</hi> cryed out. Alas my Lord, we are both heere together aliue as yet, albeit we haue often e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough wiſhed for death. Then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> cauſed candles to bee ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the lamp, which hung at the entrance of the dungeon, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them all to come forth, to their no little ioy and comfort, ſeeing themſelues deliuered from ſuch miſerable ſeruitude: and when they came into the open Court, they fell on their knees before the Prince, thanking God and him for this happie benefit. <hi>Amadis</hi> behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their faces ſo pale, wan, and ouer-ſpent, ſeeming rather bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ghoſted then liuing creatures, was moued to exceeding compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, eſpecially they being an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty priſoners in all, and thirty of them were Knigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In ſooth my Lord, replied the other, I am a Knight likewiſe, and ſeruant to the ſame King, who knoweth me full well, as likewiſe the moſt in his Court doe, with whom I haue been ſeene in greater honor then now I am: becauſe euer ſince my departure from the Court, I haue liued in the miſerie from which you redeemed me. How may I call your name? ſaide <hi>Amadis. Brandoyuas,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Knight. Full well did the Prince reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that he had heard report of him in the Court, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore courteouſly embracing him, he ſayde. Right glad am I, my ſtars ſo fauoured me, to deliuer you &amp; theſe other fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch a helliſh place: and though I neuer ſaw you til this preſent, yet oft haue I heard the King and his Barrons talke of your

                  <p>Now go they to the wife of <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, Amadis</hi> thus ſpeaking to her. Lady, for your ſake and theſe other Gentlewomen, I forbeare to ſet this Caſtle on fire, albeit the euill behauiour of your husband is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warrant therefore: but in regarde of the courteſie Knights owe to Ladies, I am content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all at this time. Alas my Lord, quoth ſhe, heauen beareth record of the griefe my ſoule hath endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, through the behauiour of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus</hi> my husband: yet could I do nothing but ſhew obedience, as beſeemed a wife to her wedded Lord, with interceſſion for his change, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, I remaine at your diſpoſition. What I will doe, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready tolde ye, it now remaineth, that at my requeſt you giue this Lady <hi>Grindaloya</hi> honorable attire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe her birth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour deſerueth no leſſe: in like manner, I would haue an Armour for this Knight, to requite his own which was taken from him, and a horſe as beſeemeth one of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. If you miſlike of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, doe more or leſſe as you thinke good, but for mine owne part, I will haue hence the armour of <hi>Arcalaus</hi> in liew of mine, and his horſe, by reaſon mine own was better: yet muſt I tell ye withall, that hee hath taken a ſword from me more worth then all the reſt. Sir, anſwered the Lady, your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is ſo reaſonable, that beyond the power you alone haue heere, I ſtand bound in dutie to fulfill your commandement. Then ſent ſhe for the ſame armour belonged to <hi>Brandoyuas,</hi> and cauſed a horſe to be deliuered him: as for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſhe brought her into her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where ſhe clothed her in moſt ſumptuous accouſtrements, and returning to <hi>Amadis,</hi> deſired him to eate ſomewhat before he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whereto he willingly condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended. Now was the beſt viandes brought foorth, ſo ſhort warning might affoord, but <hi>Grindaloya</hi> was in ſuch haſt to be gone, as ſhe was loth to be troubled with any: whereat <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Brandoyuas</hi> merily ſmiled, eſpecially at the Dwarffe, who looked ſo pale and wan with feare, that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to offer one word, which made <hi>Amadis,</hi> thus to ieſt with him. Tell mee Dwarffe, wilt thou that we tarry heere till <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> come, and I to giue thee the ſuite thou deſireſt? In ſooth, my Lord, quoth the Dwarffe, ſo deere hath the requeſt coſt me I made to you, as (while I liue) neither of you or any other will I craue the like: for Gods ſake then let vs be gone ere the Diuell come againe, for I cannot ſtand on the leg he hung me by, beſide, my noſe is ſo full of ſulphurous and ſtinking ſmels, as neuer ſhall I giue ouer ſneezing till I die. The Dwarffes words made them all laugh hartely, and after they had repaſted, <hi>Amadis</hi>

Beleeue me Lady, quoth he, though I neuer care for it with him, yet ſhall it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine twixt you and me, becauſe you deſerue it. So fortuned it after-ward theſe words tooke effect, and highly profited the good Lady, as in ſome part of this hiſtory you ſhall heare recited.</p>
                  <p>Now are they departed from the Caſtle of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> riding till the night ouer-tooke them, lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at a Ladyes place fiue leagues thence, where they were entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with very gracious welcome: and on the morrow, after they had thanked their friendly hoſt, as they rode together, <hi>Amadis</hi> thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with <hi>Brandoyuas.</hi> Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sir, I trauaile in ſearch of a Knight, as here-tofore I told ye, &amp; imagining it will be little pleaſure to you to follow me, it were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe then if we parted. In ſooth Sir, anſwered <hi>Brandoyuas,</hi> I gladly would goe to King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> court, notwithſtanding, if you thinke it good, I will keepe ye company. Little neede ſhall I haue thereof, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I thanke ye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alone, ſo ſoone as I haue brought this Lady into ſuch ſafety as ſhe thinkes meete. My Lord, quoth ſhe, I will accompany this Gentleman if you pleaſe, ſeeing he trauaileth to the Court of King <hi>Liſuarts:</hi> and there I hope to finde him for whom I was priſoner, who I am aſſured will be glad of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance. Now truſt me, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis,</hi> very well ſayde, goe then together, and God be your guid. Thus are they ſeperated, now remaining none with <hi>Amadis</hi> but <hi>Gandalin</hi> &amp; the Dwarffe, of whom the Prince likewiſe demanded what he meant to do. Mary be your truſty ſeruant, ſayde the Dwarffe, if you like ſo well as I. I am well pleaſed, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> and thou ſhalt doe what thou wilt thy ſelfe. In ſooth my Lord, quoth the Dwarffe, ſeeing you releaſed me, I would gladly remaine in your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, for I know not where I may be halfe ſo well: the man and the maiſter being both agreed: they tooke their way as fortune liked to conduct them.</p>
                  <p>Not farre had they trauailed, but they met one of the Ladyes, that reſcued him from enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Arcalaus</hi> Caſtle, ſhee wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and mourning very grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: which mouing <hi>Amadis</hi> to pitty her complaints, made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the cauſe thereof. A Knight who rideth not farre before, quoth ſhe, hath taken from me a little caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, wherein is matter of great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, yet no way able to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him: for ſuch things are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as within theſe three dayes one in my company and my ſelfe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored from death the beſt Knight in the world, and ſhee likewiſe of whom I tell ye, is violently caryed away by another Knight, who is ridden before intending to force her. Heere you muſt obſerue, that the Damoſell now talking with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> knew him not, by reaſon his helmet beuer couered his face: but when he heard how her casket was taken from her, hee neuer left gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopping till he ouer-tooke him, to whom hee thus ſpake, Knight, you deale not courteouſly, giuing this Lady cauſe thus to complaine of you, and me-thinkes you ſhould do a great deale better, to deliuer the casket againe you tooke from
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7179:70"/>
her: but when the Knight heard him, hee fell in a great laughter. Why do ye thus laugh Sir? ſayd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis.</hi> I laugh at you, anſwered the Knight, whom I thinke ſcant wiſe in giuing conncell to him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it not, the leſſe hope may you haue in ſpeeding in your ſuite. it may be, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> you care not for my words, yet it were good to deliuer the thing is none of yours. Belike you threaten me the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? ſayde the Knight. Not you Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> but your ouer-much boldnes in vſing force where it ought not to be. Is it true, quoth the Knight: with theſe words hee ſet the casket aſide in a tree, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſayd. If your brauery be ſuch in deedes as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in words, come teach mee know it and receiue the law. So gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſpurres to their horſes, they encountred together in ſuch ſorte, as the Knight being diſmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, his horſe fel ſo heauily on him, that he was not able to riſe againe: in meane while <hi>Amadis</hi> fetched the cofer, and deliuering it to the Damoſell, ſayd. Take your owne faire Lady, &amp; tarry here till I bring your companion. Preſently he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted after the other Knight, ouer-taking him at a thicket of trees, where he had tyed both his horſe and the Ladies, trayling her by the haire of the head into the wood, there to commit his villainous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, but <hi>Amadis</hi> cryed to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loude in this manner. Of an euill death maiſt thou dye traytor, that wroneſt a Lady in this ſorte without offending thee. As the Knight ſtrougled with her to get her into the wood, hee looked vp and ſaw <hi>Amadis,</hi> whereupon he left her, making ſpeede to his weapons and mounted on horſeback, then approching neere the Prince, hee ſayd. By my hand Knight, in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe time for thee didſt thou hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me of my will. Such a will, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> as diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>th ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; both men and beaſts deſpiſe. If I take not reuenge for it, quoth the knight then let me neuer weare armour againe. The world therein ſhall ſuſtaine a great loſſe, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> of one addicted to ſuch villainy, that ſeeks to force Ladies, who ought in all liberty and honor to be defended, and ſo they bee by all loyall Knights: With a braue courſe they met together, when though the knight brake his lancs, yet was hee hurled againſt the ground ſo violently, as the weight of his armour and ſtrength of his fall, made him lye trembling in a trance. Which <hi>Amadis</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, to rid him out of his paine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, he trampled on his belly with his horſe feete, ſaying. Thus ſhalt thou looſe thy deſire of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Ladyes. And as for you faire ſoule, I hope heereafter you are rid from any danger of him. The more am I to thank you my Lord, quoth ſhe, would God my companion who hath loſt her casket, were as well deliuered as I am. She was the firſt, I met withall, anſwered <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> wherefore firſt of all I ſuccored her ſo well, as ſhee hath recouered what was taken from her, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde where my Squire conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her hither-ward.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe the heat was ſome-what violent, <hi>Amadis</hi> put off his helmet to take the ayre, when the Damoſell immediately knew him: for it was ſhee that at his returne from <hi>Gaule,</hi> conducted him to <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gand the vnknowne,</hi> when by Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualry he deliuered her friend at the Caſtle of <hi>Bradoyd,</hi> which made her remember him, and ſo did <hi>Amadis</hi> her, when alighting they embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

each other, the like courteſie be ſhewed to the other Damoſell. Alas! quoth they, had we but drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on ſuch a defender, no villain could haue wronged vs halfe ſo much. On my faith, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> the help you gaue me within theſe three daies, may notbe compared with this matter of no validitie: for I was in greater extreamity the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, but how could you poſſibly vnderſtand thereof? My Lord, (quoth ſhe that tooke him by the hand when hee was enchanted) mine Aunt <hi>Vrganda</hi> ſent me to the Caſtle of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> by whoſe meanes we came thither, and you were recouered. Heauen ſhielde from euill that good Lady, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis,</hi> who hath ſo many waies bound me her obedient ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant: and you faire Damoſels, the meſſengers of this fauour, haue you any thing elſe wherein to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me? No my Lord, ſaid they, take you the way you left, and wee wil returne from whence we came. Fare well ſweet Virgins, replied <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> remember my humble du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the health of your Miſtreſſe, telling her, ſhe knowes right well I am her Knight. In this manner rode the Damozels one way, and <hi>Amadis</hi> another: wherefore wee muſt now tell what happened to <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> ſince his departure from the Caſtle of <hi>Valderin.</hi>

                     <hi>Arcalaus</hi> had his head and hands vnarmed, wherefore without ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Gentlemen, he ſtepped to the King with theſe words. Sir, I come to acquite a promiſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I ſtand bound, namely to let you vnderſtand, how I haue ſlaine a Knight in battaile, that ſome-time bare theſe armes. And albeit I muſt be content to declare mine owne prayſe, which were more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable for me, being reported by another in mine abſence: yet am I conſtrained to do no leſſe, ſeeing the couenant was betweene me &amp; him whom I haue ſlaine: <hi>viz.</hi> that the conquerour ſhould diſpoyle the vanquiſhed of his head, and preſent it before you as this day. Full loth was I to be ſo cruell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee tolde mee hee was your Queenes Knight, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and ſo hee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelfe whom I vanquiſhed. As for me Sir, I tolde him in truth that I was <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> whom fortune
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7179:71"/>
hath graced with ſuch ſinguler fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: for I haue ſlaine the man, ſome-time owner of this armour and horſe, which as a teſtimony of my victory I brought with mee. Ah God, ſayde the King, is then the moſt vertuous and accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Knight in the world dead? you lowring heauens, why began ye ſo braue to courſe in him, and now on ſuch a ſudden to cut it off? Theſe ſorrowfull newes prouoked ſighes and teares, both in the King and his royall company, which <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus</hi> perceiuing, not ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe, returned the ſame way he came, feigning himſelfe likewiſe very ſad and grieued: but you muſt thinke he went not with-out great ſtore of curſes, euery one inſtantly deſiring God, to ſend him an euill and ſpeedy death, which with their Swordes they could gladly haue beſtowed on him themſelues, but that they heard howe <hi>Amedis</hi> was ſlaine by an accorded battaile.</p>
                  <p>The King being ouercome with penſiueneſſe and ſorrow, returned to the Towne, where theſe newes were ſo opened to euery one, that at length the Queene and her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes heard thereof, which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuerted their former plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in to mourning. At this time was the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> in her chamber with the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> where hearing the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den clamour and noyſe, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her to goe vnderſtand the cauſe thereof. Alas good Lady, too ſoone was it brought to her, for no ſooner was ſhe acquainted with the death of <hi>Amadis,</hi> but her immoderate paſſions expreſſed the anguiſh of her heart: and more to afflict this gentle Princeſſe, the other Ladyes came weeping into her chamber, ſaying.

It is true ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, anſwered the Damoſell, but what remedy? you muſt not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe dy for company. Theſe words made <hi>Oriana</hi> fall into a ſwoune, which the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> beholding, thought ſhee had too indiſcreetly brought her theſe bad tidings, whereupon ſhe called the Princeſſe <hi>Mabila,</hi> ſaying. Helpe Madame, my miſtreſſe dyeth. She being come, ſaw that ſhee neither moued or breathed, doubted leaſt life had taken leaue indeed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe commanded the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to ſhut the dore, to the end her loue all this while ſo well concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, might not breake foorth into open ſuſpition.

Ah ſweete friends, hinder me not in the way of death, if you deſire my reſt, and would haue God find him another world, who knew not how to liue one day without me.

Thus liueſt thou in place immortall, I remaining heere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone after thee, can giue but woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and vnthankfull ſpeeches. Ah cruell death, ſufficed it not that mighty loue murdered him with his feathered ſteele, but thou muſt kill him out-right with thy cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſtroke? well, in reſpect it is ſo, offend not thy ſelfe my loue, for thou ſhalt ſoone ſee reaſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her that did thee wrong, who beeing the cauſe, will beare thee company in death.

After theſe words ſhe ſwounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in <hi>Mabilaes</hi> armes, and in ſuch manner altered her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as they reputed her verily dead, her faire and golden lockes being diſcheueled, her armes and legges depriued of vitall motion, euen as when the ſoule hath taken his flight, from the body. <hi>Mabila</hi> deſparing of any life left in her, was ſo ſurpriſed with griefe, that ſhee was conſtrained to leaue the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell alone with the Princeſſe, &amp; walking ſome-what aſide by her ſelfe thus lamented.

Why Madame? quoth one, will ye leaue vs? at leaſt yet ſpeake to vs. Madame ſaide the other, your <hi>Amadis</hi> is yet aliue and well. At the name of <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſhee opened her eyes, turning her head here and there as if ſhe looked for him: which good humour <hi>Mabila</hi> deſirous to continue, proceeded thus. <hi>Amadis</hi> commeth Madame, and ſhortly you ſhall ſee him. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> giuing a great ſigh, ſtarted vp, ſaying. Alas ſweete friend, where is he? We vnderſtand, quoth ſhee, that he is in very good health, and how the Knight who brought theſe bad tidings, is wont to vaunt of himſelfe without cauſe, feeding himſelfe with falſe praiſe of decer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Knights. Why? ſaide <hi>Oriana,</hi> haue I not heard that hee brought his horſe and armour? A matter of nothing, anſwered <hi>Mabila,</hi> they may as wel be borrowed or ſtolne, or he (happily) ſent with that falſe

Why Madam? thinke you if I held theſe babling newes for truth, I could haue the power to comfort you in this ſort, the loue I beare to my Cozin is not ſo little, but rather I ſhould incite all the world to weepe, then want conſolation for you, who ſtand in ſuch neede thereof.

What a traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous villaine is that? replied <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doyuas,</hi> but worſe is befalne him then he weeneth as yet: hereto he added what paſſed betweene <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> &amp; <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> as already you haue heard, whereby each one forſooke the ſorrow of the former falſe newes, the King preſently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, that <hi>Grindaloya</hi> ſhould be conducted to the Queene, that ſhee might vnderſtand theſe happy tidings.</p>
                  <p>Into the Queenes chamber is ſhe brought, and the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> hearing her reporte, ran with all ſpeede to the Princeſſe <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> who hearing by her the truth of all, the paſſage of her ſpeech was ſtopt for a long time, ſeeming as one confounded with enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thinking in theſe newes ſhee gaue her the bag, or that ſhe drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them, but when ſhe recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the vſe of her tongue, ſhe thus anſwered the Damoſell. Alas my friend, did I raue? or toldeſt thou me that <hi>Grindaloya</hi> teſtified to the Queene, how <hi>Amadis</hi> is not dead? In good faith, quoth the Damoſel, I came but euen now from her highnes chamber, where <hi>Grinda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loya</hi> declared how <hi>Arcalaus</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Happy bee this houre, ſayde <hi>Oriana,</hi> but I pray thee goe tell my mother, that <hi>Mabila</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treates her to ſende the Lady to comfort her: which ſhe did, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning right ſoone with <hi>Grindaloya</hi> to <hi>Oriana.</hi> I leaue to imagine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhee were well entertained or no, with all the modeſt courteſies ſo glad tidings deſerued, likewiſe whether <hi>Oriana</hi> and <hi>Mabila</hi> gaue her audience, when ſhe recounted <hi>Amadis</hi> deedes of armes at <hi>Valde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> the miſery of her and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the danger whereinto he fell afterward by the enchantments of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> from which hee was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by two ſtrange Damoſels. The diſcourſe hereof ſo pleaſed &amp; contented them, that I think <hi>Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daloya</hi> had an endleſſe taske in the reporting, for <hi>Oriana</hi> muſt heare euery thing often redoubled. But repeating the dangers of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and the miſery from which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the poore captiues, cauſed teares ſo thick as winters haile to trill downe her cheekes. Thus tari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Grindaloya</hi> all day wiih the two Princeſſes, and had not ſo ſoone departed, but that ſhee was aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, how that King <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wales,</hi> (who loued her deerely) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected her returne in the Queenes chamber. Good reaſon had ſhe to take leaue of <hi>Oriana,</hi> and ſeeke him
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7179:73"/>
from whom ſhee ſuffered ſuch ſorrow: But when theſe loyall lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers met together, each one was delighted ſo ſubſtantially, as <hi>Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daloya</hi> thought her griefes well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced. Now becauſe the Queene vnderſtood, how ſhee was daughter to King <hi>Ardroyd</hi> of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis,</hi> and all her miſeries had been for the loue of king <hi>Arban:</hi> with inſtant intreaty ſhee procured her ſtay in the Court, doing her all the honour and fauour could be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. <hi>Grindaloya</hi> was not curious in granting the Queenes requeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe king <hi>Arban</hi> was partaker in the ſame ſuite: by this occaſion the Queene was aduertiſed, that ſhee had a maruailous faire ſiſter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Aldena,</hi> who was nouriſhed in the Duke of <hi>Briſtoyaes</hi> caſtle, which made her preſently diſpatch a Gentleman thither, with requeſt that the Dutcheſſe would ſend her to the Court. This <hi>Aldena</hi> was the friend to <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſhee for him ſuffered ſuch iniurie by the Dwarff as you haue heard before diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

from his Horſe, bidding his Squire alight to drinke as he did: but while they were drinking, the knight claſped on his owne head <hi>Galaors</hi> helmet, and taking his Launce mounted on his Horſe, when leauing the Prince drinking he rode away, ſaying. Farewell Knight, I muſt be gone, tarry thou here to beguile another as I haue done thee. <hi>Galaor</hi> lifting his head from the water, and ſeeing the Knight make ſuch haſt away, thus called to him. Ah villaine, neuer did theefe ſuch a tteacherous pranck as thou haſt done: for thou haſt not alone deceiued me, but committed an act of great diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, which thou ſhalt well know, if euer I meet with thee. Yea mary, anſwered the knight, reſt your ſelfe there, till you recouer ſome other meane to combat with me.</p>
                  <p>Gone is the Knight ſo faſt as he could gallop, leauing <hi>Galuor</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing like a mad man, but ſeeing there was no remedy, he mounted on his Squires horſe and purſued him, til at length he came to a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way: when not knowing which of them to take, becauſe he had loſt the ſight of him, hee ſtood ſtill in great penſiuenes, till at length hee ſaw a Damoſel come riding a pace toward him, of whom hee deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if ſhe met not a knight moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a bay Courſer, bearing in a white ſheeld a vermilion flower. What would you with him? reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Damoſell. I would quoth he recouer again my horſe &amp; Armes, for they be mine, and by falſe vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies hee hath carried them from me. When happened this? ſaid the Damoſell: wherewith <hi>Galaor</hi> told her all the diſcourſe. Well, quoth the Damoſell, what can you doe to him being thus vnarmed? for I thinke hee tooke them not away to reſtore them againe. I care for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> but to finde him once more. Truſt me, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Damoſell, if you wil grant me one boone, ſoone ſhall I bring ye together againe, <hi>Galaor</hi> being very deſirous hereof, agreed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing ſhe would demand. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me then, quoth ſhe, ſo turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her horſe, rode the ſame way ſhe came, keeping co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany a while together: but the Damoſell being better mounted then he, left him behinde with his Squire, &amp; rid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo faſt, that they had loſt the fight of her, trauailing the ſpace of 3. miles without any news of her, but at laſt on a great plain they ſaw her returne againe, here you muſt note, that the cauſe of her riding thus before, was to aduertiſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knight (being her deere friend) of their comming, and hee had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely ſent her to fetch <hi>Galaor,</hi> to deceiue him of the reſt of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: which he imagined eaſily to do without danger, ſeeing hee had gotten the chiefeſt thing of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and afterward he intended to kill him, or put him to ſome noro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhame. For this cauſe he tary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Pauilion, erected by him on the plaine, and no ſooner came ſhe to <hi>Galaor,</hi> but thus ſhe ſpake. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the end I might not faile in my promiſe, I forſooke your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a while, only to ſee if the man you looke for, were in the place I left him or no: there haue I found him little thinking on your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in yonder Pauilion may you ſpeake with him at pleaſure. As thus they deuiſed together, they came to the Tent, wherefore <hi>Galaor</hi> alighted to euter, but the Knight meeting him at the doore, ſaid. Sir knight, what moueth thee to come in here without licence, truſt me it is but little for thy profit
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7179:74"/>
becauſe thou muſt here leaue the reſt of thine Armour, or die pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. Thou mayſt be therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> and the wordes of ſuch a wretch as thou art cannot feare me.</p>
                  <p>This reply very angerly incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Knight, lifting vp his ſword to ſmite the Prince on the head, but <hi>Galaor</hi> cunningly eſcaped the blowe, giuing his enemy ſuch a ſtroake on the top of his helmet, as made him ſet one knee to the ground: then quickly laying hold on him, got the helmet beſide his head, ſpurning him ſo ſtrongly with his feete, that therewith hee fell on his face to the earth. When the Knight beheld himſelfe in ſuch danger, he called with a loud voice to the Damoſell for ſuccor, where-upon ſhe ſtepped to <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſaying: that hee ſhould holde his hand, for this was the boone he promiſed to giue her. But he being in extream choller, gaue no care to her ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, bringing the Knight into ſuch eſtate, as hee left no vitall motion in him: whereat the Domoſell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to deſpaire, breathed forth many grieuous lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſaying. Alas wretch that I am, too long haue I trifled time: for in ſeeking to beguile another, my ſelfe am worthiely requited with deceite. And thou traytor quoth ſhee to <hi>Galaor,</hi> who haſt thus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly put him to death, heauen ſend thee a more worſe and hapleſſe end, for by thee haue I loſt my on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felicity in this world: for which (bee well aſſured) it ſhall coſt thee thy life, becauſe thou haſt broken promiſe with mee, and in ſuch a place will I demand reuenge on thee, as nothing but thy death ſhal expiate my anger, wert thou a Knight of greater hardineſſe then thou art: if then thou make refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall there, I ſhall haue more then iuſt occaſion to publiſh in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the puſillanimity of thy faint hearted courage.</p>
                  <p>Faire Damoſell, anſwered <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> if I had thought his death would haue beene ſo grieuons to you, I could haue ſpared part of my diſpleaſure, though iuſtly hee deſerned no leſſe, but you ſpake when it was too late. The worſe for thee, replyed the Damoſell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy death ſhall recompence his. <hi>Galaor</hi> ſeeing ſhee continued her threatning ſpeeches, without any further anſwere left her, lacing on his helmet, mounting on the horſe the dead Knight tooke from him: and hauing ridden a pretty while, hee looked backe to ſee if the Damoſell followed him, when perceiuing her hard at his horſe heeles, demanded of her whither ſhee trauailed. With thee, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Damoſell, and neuer will I leaue thee, till I haue found op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to requeſt the boone thou didſt promiſe me, which ſhal be the loſſe of thy head by ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill death. Me thinkes it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſayde <hi>Galaor,</hi> for you to take ſome other ſatisfaction of me, and happily might bee more pleaſing to you. Not any thing elſe, quoth ſhee, thy ſoule ſhall accompany his whom thou haſt ſlaine, elſe ne-uer ſhalt thou accompliſh what thou haſt promiſed mee. Well, well, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> I muſt ſtand to the hazard of that as I may: thus quarreling, they rode on three dayes together, and entered the Forreſt of <hi>Angad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But now he returneth againe to <hi>Amadis,</hi> who taking his leaue of <hi>Vrgandaes</hi> Damoſels, as you haue
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7179:75"/>
heard before recited: rode on till about noone time, when iſſuing forth of the Forreſt, hee ſaw on a plaine a very faire Caſtell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out came a goodly Chariot, ſo brauely equiped as euer he beheld any, it being drawen by two braue red ſteedes, which were couered with imbroydered crimſon ſattin, as it made a very dainty and ſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew. The Chariot was guarded by eight armed Knights, yet <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> being deſirous to ſee who was in it, drew ſomewhat neere to lift vp the rich couering, but one of the Knights came to him with theſe rough wordes: Keepe backe Sir Knight, and bee not ſo bold to come thus neere. What I doe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> is for no harme. Whatſoeuer it bee replyed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, trouble your ſelfe no further, in reſpect you are not worthy to ſee what is here couered: for if you enterpriſe the like againe, it will value your life, becauſe thou muſt deale with all in this troupe, and ſome ſuch one is amongſt vs, as is able alone to get the maiſtrie of thee, more eaſily then may wee altogther vſe thee as we liſt. I know not, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> the Knights va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour you ſpeake of, but hap good or bad, I will ſee what is in the Chariot. Herewith hee tooke his Armes, which the two Knights ſeeing that rode formoſt, they ran both againſt him, the one breaking his Launce, and the other miſſing: but <hi>Amadis</hi> ſped otherwiſe, for the firſt very eaſily hee caſt from his ſaddle, &amp; the other he threw both horſe and man to the ground. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> went towarde the Chariot, yet was he ſtayed by two other Knights, one of them being likewiſe diſmounted, and with his ſword hee gaue the other ſuch a welcome on the pate, as hee was glad to keep himſelfe from falling by catching faſt holde about his horſe necke, when the other foure ſawe their companions ſo vſed by one Knight, they maruailed not a little, and being willing to reuenge their iniury, altogether fiercely charged <hi>Amadis.</hi> With this laſt aſſault hee found himſelfe ſore combred, for one of them tainted him in the ſhield, and another in his armour, as hee eſcaped hardly from beeing ouerthrowne: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee held out vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, deliuering ſuch ſtroakes to the firſt he met, as hee fell beſide his horſe in a ſwoune. The three that remayned turned their faces, ſeeking which way they might ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt hurt him: but hee ſnatched a Launce from one of them, which yet remayned whole, and met one with ſuch a full carriere, that pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing quite thorough his throate, hee fell to the ground and gaue vp the Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>After his death, he came to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of them, and with his ſword ſmote the helmet from his head: when ſeeing hee was a very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent knight, hauing his head and beard ſo white as ſnowe, mooued with pittie, he friendly thus ſpake. Father, henceforth it were good you left the vſe of armes to youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then your ſelfe, ſeeing you haue liued ſo long without gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning honour or commendation, marry your age doth now excuſe yee. In good faith anſwered the Knight, your ſpeeches are very contrary, becauſe if it bee ſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for young men to ſeeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne and fame by armes: it is more neceſſarie that an auncient man ſhould doe his endeauour, to maintayne thoſe affaires ſo long as he can. Beleeue me Father, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> your reaſon is good.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7179:75"/>
While thus they talked together, <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaw him who was firſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſed, make great haſt toward the Caſtle, and ſo did the other which were wounded: wherefore hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to the Chariot, and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp the couering, beheld there a tombe of Marble, hauing a crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King figured thereon, clothed in his royall ornaments, yet was his Crowne and part of his head ſome what ſeuered aloofe from the reſt. Hard by ſat a very antient Lady, and neere her a yong Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of moſt excellent beauty, whom very gratiouſly hee ſaluted, ſpeaking to the antient Lady in this manner. I pray ye tell me Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, what figure is this which you accompanie ſo carefully? What Sir Knight? quoth ſhee, (not knowing her gardants were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited) who gaue you permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſee our ſecrets? None o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> then my deſire thus to doe. In good faith, quoth the Lady, this is in you a great part of preſumption, and I meruaile that my Knights would ſuffer it: then putting her head forth of the Chariot, ſhee ſaw ſome of them ſlaine, others flying to the Caſtle for their ſafeti, &amp; ſom ran after their Horſes that were eſcaped, whereat ſhe was ſo amazed, as ſhe thus cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out: Ah Knight, curſed be the houre of thy birth, who haſt done me this cruell outrage. Madam, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> your people aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled me: but now may it pleaſe ye to ſatisfie my demand? Neuer ſhalt thou, quoth ſhe, be reſolued therein by me, hauing offered mee ſuch monſtrous abuſe: ſo ſaying, ſhe cauſed the horſes to hie away with the Chariot. <hi>Amadit,</hi> behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her ſo agreeued, would trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her no more but rode on his iourney: then were the dead bodies put into the Chariot, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conueyed into the Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>Now had the dwarffe heard all that paſſed betweene <hi>Amadis</hi> and the Lady, but hee knew not what was within the Chariot, wherefore he deſired to know of his Maſter. I cannot tell thee, quoth he, for ſhe would make no anſwere thereof to me. In ſooth, ſaid the Dwarffe, it is ſtrange that women haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hold their peace. As thus they rode beguiling the time, on a ſudden they eſpied the old Knight now vnarmed, gallop apace after them, crying ſo loud as he could to <hi>Amadis,</hi> that he ſhould ſtay, which he did, when he deliuered him this meſſage. My Lord, I come to you by commandement of the Lady whom you ſaw in the Chariot, and ſhe being willing to make amends for the iniury ſhe did ye, deſires you to take a lodging this night in her Caſtle. Ah Father, replyed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> I found her in ſuch griefe for the debate betweene me and your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions, that I think my pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

many armed men, who flocking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, cryed. Yeeld Knight elſe thou art but dead. Not ſhall you ſaid hee, with my will, keept me your priſoner. So hee laced his Helmet, but he had no leyſure as yet to take his ſhield, ſo ſharpely was he aſſayled by his enemies: yet did he worthily defend himſelfe, ſending them to the Earth he met withall, at length by the multitude of his aſſaylants, he was driuen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a corner of the Court, which he recouering, and keeping them therein all before him, endomaged them much better then hee did before. But while hee was thus combatting, he ſaw the Dwarffe and <hi>Gandalin</hi> carried into priſon, whereat hee conceiued ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, as being exempt from feare of death, he layed ſuch loade on his enemies, that no one durſt come neere him: albeit they were ſo many, as often times hee was in danger to fall on his knees, yet looking for no mercy at ſuch mens hands, would deerely buy his death among them, cauſing diuerſe of them to fall dead at his feete. And the diuine bounty regarding him in pitty, deliuered him from this perill by the young beautifull Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, who marking his braue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour in Chiualrie, intended to ſaue him, calling one of her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to whom ſhe ſaid.

Why Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam? anſwered the Gentle woman, what meane ye to doe? Let looſe my Lyons, anſwered the Lady, that they may bee ſcattered, who offer wrong to the beſt Knight in els world: and thou (being my vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile) I comm and there preſently to goe let them looſe.

The men being all afraide, fled vp and downe to ſhunne the fury of the beaſts, but the Lyons made ſuch ſpeede after them, as diuerſe they ouertooke and rent in pieces. When <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaw himſelfe thus rid of his enemies, ſeeing the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of the Caſtle was yet open, he went out and held the doore faſt to him, while the Lions deuoured the other in the Court.</p>

This fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable kindnes let vs obtaine at your hands, whereby wee ſhall yeeld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the wrong wee haue done ye: and on my faith I ſweare to you, our intent was no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to gaine you our priſoner, vntill you conſented to bee our knight. Madame, anſwered <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> you ſhould haue labored your determination by a more honeſt way: for without conſtraint I would willingly haue yeelded my ſelfe, as I haue to diuers Ladies, who knowe full well my ſeruice. Will ye then Sir, quoth ſhe, open the gate? No, replied <hi>Amadis:</hi> wherewith ſhe went from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and the young Lady trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſhewed her ſelfe, thus calling to <hi>Amadis.</hi> Ah gentle Sir, ſuch are within heere, who could not ſuffer the iniurie done to you, the better they deſerue to finde ſome fauour. With ſuch ſeemely modeſty vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Ladie theſe words, as <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> asked her, if ſhe would haue the gate opened? Yea mary Sir, quoth ſhe, I humbly deſire ye. Preſently he aroſe to obey her requeſt, but ſhe willed him to ſtay awhile, till the olde Lady warranted him aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance from the reſt of her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: nor could he but commend her wit and diſcretion, who get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him ſecurity from all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, made promiſe likewiſe, that <hi>Gandalin</hi> and the Dwarffe ſhould be deliuered from impriſonment. Then came the ancient knight, of whom we ſpake before, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to <hi>Amadis,</hi> he ſayd. Becauſe me thinkes (Sir) your Shield is greatly impared, and your ſword in like manner broken, take this ſhield and this mace, wherewith you may defend the Lyons when they come forth: ſo throwing the mace and the ſhield downe, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> willingly tooke them vp, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this anſwere. Let me neuer be in gratefull to them that ſuccor me in neede.

By my ſoule, ſaide <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> neuer was I ſo miſuſed vpon no occaſion, but ſeeing all enmity is ouer-blowne, you muſt giue me a horſe, for your ſeruants (I thanke them) haue ſlaine mine. Sir knight, anſwered the olde Lady, it is now ſomewhat late, if you pleaſe to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme your ſelfe, and reſt here this night, to morrow you ſhall haue a horſe, or what elſe you neede. In hope you meane no worſe then you ſay, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> I will not refuſe your offer, becauſe the time doth requeſt no leſſe.</p>

Sir Knight, quoth ſhe, if you will promiſe to accompliſh the couenants, before you be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the accident: I will tell ye, if not, I pray ye holde me excuſed. It were no reaſon Madame, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Amadis,</hi> to promiſe any thing ouer-lightly, being ignorant to what it may relate: but if you will let me heare the couenants, they ſeeming reaſonable, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of a Knights power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, feare not to tell me, for I will imploy my vttermoſt therein. You haue reaſon, anſwered the Lady: then cauſing each one to with-draw, except the faire young vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, ſhe thus began. Vnderſtand gentle Sir, that the figure of ſtone you behelde, was made in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this Ladyes father, who lyeth entombed in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, being in his time a crowned King, but on an eſpeciall feſtiuall day, as he helde open Court and royall, hee was aſſailed by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the vnckle to this mayden, who came to tell him, that the Crowne hee wore was his, by as good right as hee could clame it, they being both iſſued from one roote. Then drawing a ſword, which he had hid vnder his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, gaue him ſuch a ſtroake there-with on the head, that it parted in ſuch ſorte as you ſaw in the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Long time before did the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But the King being dead, this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall wretch was honoured with the Crowne, for the murdered Prince had no other heire then this his faire daughter, whom the aged Knight that brought you hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had in guard, he ſhewing him-ſelfe ſo faithfull to her, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaied her thence ere her vnckle could take her, &amp; performed ſuch painefull dilligence, that hee brought my orphaine Neece hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for her better ſafety. After-ward finding the meane to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the body of the King her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, each day we put into our Chariot, riding there-with about the fields as you ſaw vs, we hauing all ſollemnely ſworne not to ſhew it to any one, vnleſſe by force of armes we ſhould be compelled thereto: and though ſuch a one happened to ſee it, yet would we not reueale why we conducted it ſo, except he would promiſe to reuenge this horrible treaſon. Now if you be a noble Knight, bound to proſecute vertue, and on ſo iuſt occaſion, you will imploy the forces God hath lent ye in a matter of right: for my part, I will continue as I begun, vntill I finde two other Knights on this behalfe that you three for vs may confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the traitour and his two ſons, who will alow no combate, vnleſſe they fight altogether, which they haue often publiſhed abroade: how ſuch as will reproue their dealings, muſt come in this ſorte. In ſooth Madame, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> great reaſon haue you to ſeeke meanes of reuenge, for the moſt famous iniurie that euer I heard of, and he who hath done it, ſurely cannot long endure without ſhame and miſ-fortune, becauſe heauen ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſuch monſtrous actions: but if you can bring it to paſſe, that one after another they will come to, the combate, by the helpe of

By my conſcience Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, replyed the Knight, I neuer thought ſuch malice had remained in a woman of your ſort, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue aſſuredly (being yet ſo yong) if longer you liue, you will accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome yourſelf to ſuch vilainie as this you begin withall: whereby you ſhall infect the ayre and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther elements, to the diſaduantage of the honeſt and vertuous Ladies liuing at this day.

Now truſt me, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> neuer was falſe ſtrumpet more rightly ſerued, and now am I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargd of the promiſe I made her.

My Lords, your Armours deliuer teſtimony enough, how diſcourteouſly your Swords haue intreated your bodies, wherefore me thinks long tarrying in this place, will but endanger your wounds: let me requeſt ye then to mount on horſeback, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me to the Caſtle, whether you ſhall not onely be welcome, but finde helpe for your hurts by one skilfull therein.

                  <p>In ſhort time they arriued at the Caſtle of <hi>Balays,</hi> where they found Gentlemen and Ladeies that cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly entertained them: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Balays</hi> had ſent them word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how he brought with him the two beſt Knights in the world, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> who deliuered him from the ſtrong priſon of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> and his noble brother <hi>Galaor.</hi> For this cauſe were they welcommed much more honourably, and brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a goodly chamber to bee vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, where likewiſe ſtood two coſtly beds, and a table furniſhed with ſoueraigne medicins for their wounds, the cure whereof, two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies (being Neeces to <hi>Balays)</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke, for they were very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly skilled in Chirurgery. Now did they imploy their vttermoſt cunning, to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence <hi>Amadis</hi> for his worthy pains, in reſtoring their Vnckle from the ſlauerie of <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus:</hi> ſo that within few daies, they felt themſelues indifferently amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and almoſt able to beare their Armour as they did before. Here-upon, <hi>Amadis</hi> comming with his brother <hi>Galaor,</hi> declared how to ſeeke him, he departed, from the Court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> promiſing not to returne without his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: wherefore he intreated him to yeelde no deniall, in reſpect no Princes Court was better frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Chiualrie, nor could he finde more honour in any other place. My Lord, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> I intend to accompliſh what you pleaſe to command me, albeit I deſire not as yet to be knowne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men of account: firſt would I haue my deedes giue ſome wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, how deſirous I am to imitate your proceedings, or elſe to die in this religious affection.

Ah my Lord, replyed <hi>Galaor,</hi> neuer diſguiſe matters in this order with me, ſeeing not in deedes, no, not ſo much as in thought, am I able to reach the height of ſuch honour. Leaue we then this talke, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> for our kingly father maketh no difference of vertue betweene vs: but will ye know what I haue preſently deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? I ſee well we muſt ſtay here longer for our health, then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we would, for which cauſe I intend if you thinke good, to ſend my Dwarff before to King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, that he may aduertiſe the Queene of our ſtay, and ſo ſoone as we are able to trauaile, we meane not to tarry long from her.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T chanced on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine day, that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> ſummoned a meeting in <hi>Windſore</hi> Forreſt, which was well ſtored with red Deere, and all other game needefull for hunting. And as he was in chaſe of a Hart, hee eſpied a good diſtance from him, three armed Knights to croſſe the way: wherfore he ſent a Squire to them, with requeſt that they would come vnto him: vpon this meſſage they immediatly obeyed, returning with the Squire to the King, and when they drew neere him, he quickly knew <hi>Galuanes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſeen him many times before: when embracing him, the King bad him hartily welcom, and the reſt in his company likewiſe, for he was a Prince, that moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly entertayned all Knights, eſpecially ſtrangers: then hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what the other were. My Lord, quoth <hi>Galuanes,</hi> this young Prince is my Nephew <hi>Agraies,</hi> ſon to the king of <hi>Scottes,</hi> and one of the beſt Knights in the world I dare aſſure ye: the other is <hi>Oliuas,</hi> whom your Maieſty hath well knowne heretofore. The King em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them very louingly, ſaying to <hi>Agraies:</hi> Faire Cozin, I muſt needes take this gentleneſſe very kindely, that you would voutchſafe to ſee me. As for you ſir <hi>Oliuas,</hi> I thought you had forgotten vs, conſidering the long time ſince you were here: and in ſooth it is a matter very diſpleaſant to mee, when ſo good a Knight as you are would ſo abſent himſelfe. Dread Lord, anſwered <hi>Oliuas,</hi> my earneſt affaires kept mee hence againſt my will, which hath made me the more negligent in your ſeruice: and yet I am not free from them, as (if you pleaſe) I ſhall let ye vnderſtand. Then he reported, how <hi>Galuanes</hi> and <hi>Agraies</hi> came to his Caſtle, by meanes of the Damoſell that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them thither, whom they very worthily deliuered from death: likewiſe how the Duke of <hi>Briſtoya</hi> treacherouſly ſlew his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin, for which hee humbly craued Iuſtice, with free liberty to combat before his Maieſty, where he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to make him confeſſe his treaſon. After the King had well pondered his diſcourſe, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the hard dealing of the Duke: he was highly diſcontented for he knew <hi>Oliuas</hi> Cozin to bee a good Knight, whereupon he thus anſwered.

                  <p>Preſently the King gaue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hunting, returning with the 3. knights to his court, conferring on many matters by the way: among which the King demanded of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanes,</hi> why the Duke of <hi>Briſtoya</hi> would haue burned the Damoſell whom they reskued.

                     <hi>Agraies,</hi> that he liueth? Yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, quoth the king, <hi>Brandoyuas</hi> and <hi>Grindaloya</hi> came hither ſince then, and they gaue vs ſuch credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teſtimony of his welfare, as I may full well aſſure ye thereof: for loth am I to offend any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no one can deſire his good and honour more then I doe.

                  <p>By this time are they come to the Court, where theſe news were quickly brought to the Queene, which reioyced very many, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially faire <hi>Oliuia,</hi> who loued <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> deerer then her ſelfe, and the Princeſſe <hi>Mabila</hi> his ſiſter was not ſorry: for as ſhee came from the Queenes chamber, ſhe met <hi>Oliuia,</hi> who thus ſpake to het.

That ſhall I doe, anſwered <hi>Mabila,</hi> ſo going to the Queenes chamber, ſhe thus ſpake to her Maieſty. It were good (Madam) you ſhould ſee my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mine Vnckle <hi>Galuanes,</hi> in reſpect they are come hither to honour you with their ſeruice. Sweete friend, ſaid the Queene, I take it very gently that you haue ſo well aduiſed me, for I promiſe ye I am very deſirous to ſee them: wherewith ſhe ſent one of her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the King, deſiring him that they might come to her, which he liking very well, ſaid. Gentlemen, my Queene is deſirous to ſee you all three, let me then requeſt your conſent herein. You muſt iudge if <hi>Agraies</hi> liked this motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe he certainely knew to finde there, the princeſſe <hi>Oliuia,</hi> the choice Lady and Miſtreſſe of his heart. But when they came among the Ladies, their entertainement was good and gracious, eſpecially by the Queene her ſelfe, who cauſed them to ſit downe by her, as mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matter of more priuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. Many familiar ſpeeches were entercourſed betweene them, and practiſing by all meanes to welcom them honourably: for ſhe was the onely Queene of the world that ſooneſt could win the hearts of Gentlemen, and therein tooke no little pleaſure, by means where-of, ſhe was loued of moſt and leaſt, being reputed the moſt vertuous Lady liuing.</p>
                  <p>Now had <hi>Oliuia</hi> made choice of her place next <hi>Mabila,</hi> thinking <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> would ſooneſt come to his ſiſter when he left the Queene: but while hee beguiled the time with her, his eye glanced on the obiect of his heart, which he being vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſſemble, was compelled to a ſodaine alteration of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and could not withdraw his lookes from the Adamant of his thoughts: which the Queene ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what noted, yet imagined his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Mabila</hi> was the cauſe, and that he was deſirous to talke with her, wherefore ſhe thus ſpake to him. My Lord <hi>Agraies,</hi> will ye not ſee your ſiſter whom you loue ſo deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Yes Madam, quoth he, ſo it pleaſe you to giue me leaue? Here-with he aroſe and came to <hi>Mabila</hi> who ſtepping forward to meet him you muſt think <hi>Oliuia</hi> was not one iote behinde her, but welco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med

him both with ſemblable reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. But <hi>Oliuia</hi> louing him as you haue heard, (ouermaſtring her will with reaſon, as a moſt wiſe &amp; well aduiſed Princeſſe) gaue little in outward ſhew: till after ſundry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable ſpeeches paſſing betweene them three, they had ſome leyſure to ſtand a while aſunder from all the reſt. Yet did <hi>Agraies</hi> keep neere his Miſtreſſe, taking her by the hand, and playing with her fingers often ſent her a ſweete kiſſe in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: ſo that by intire regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her, he was tranſported with ſuch ſinguler delight, as he neither heard or made any anſwere to his ſiſter. She being ignorant as yet of his diſeaſe, knew not well what to thinke, for notwithſtanding all her courteous ſpeeches, his minde was otherwiſe buſied then on her: yet in the end ſhe diſcouered the cauſe of this ſuddaine mutation, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that <hi>Oliuia</hi> and her brother were ſurprized with each others loue. Whereupon ſhe thought it beſt to fauor them with more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, ſeigning a deſire to ſpeake with her Vnckle <hi>Galuanes,</hi> which ſhe prettily coloured in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Brother, quoth ſhe, I pray ye intreate the Queene that my Vnc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle may come hither, becauſe it is long time ſince I ſaw him, and I haue, ſomewhat to acquaint him with all ſecretly. I hope to obtaine ſo much of her, anſwered <hi>Agraies:</hi> whereupon he went to the Queene &amp; thus ſpake. Madam, if you could, ſpare mine vnckle a little, you might doe his Neece a very great pleaſure, for ſhe is deſirous to talke with him. And reaſon good, ſaid the Queene: at which words <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanes</hi> went with him, which <hi>Mabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> ſeeing, ſhe humbly met him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great reuerence, when <hi>Galua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> vſing the like to her, began in this manner. Fayre Neece, I am glad to ſee you in ſuch good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: but tell me I pray ye, do you like <hi>Scotland</hi> or this Countrey better? We ſhall confer, quoth ſhe, more conueniently at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, becauſe I haue many things to tell ye, which were needeleſſe for my brother to vnderſtand: nor ſhall he, they being of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as they are. Theſe words ſhee vttered ſmiling, and with a marueilous good grace: cheefely becauſe her brother might court his friend alone. And well ſaid Neece, anſwered <hi>Galuanes,</hi> our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets are ſo great, as they muſt needes bee kept from him. So ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her by the hand, they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to one of the windowes, by meanes whereof, <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia</hi> were left alone: When the Prince perceiuing hee had liberty to ſpeake, trembling in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of affection, he began thus. Madam, to accompliſh your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement when you parted from mee, as alſo to ſatisfie my heart which neuer enioyeth reſt, but in the gratious contentment, conueyed thereto through mine eyes by your preſence, I am come hither to ſerue and obey you: aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you on my Faith, that being neere your perſon, my ſpirits ſeek themſelues viuified in ſuch ſort, as they ſuffer with great ſtrength the anguiſhes of continuall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which makes them dead in time of your abſence.

                  <p>By this time the King was ready to the table, wherefore he ſent for the three knights from the Queen, commanding them to ſit downe by him in company of many great Lords and Barrons. And as the ſeruice came in, two Knights en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the hall, who falling on their knees before the King, the firſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus ſpake. God proſpet your Maieſtie with increaſe of ioy and honor, moſt humbly I deſire to know, if <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule</hi> be in this Court. Not at this preſent, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the King, but we could wiſh he were heere. Right glad would I be, ſayd the Knight, to finde him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by his meanes I hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer what I am now farre from. Tell vs my friend, quoth the King, if you pleaſe, who you are. My Lord, replied the ſtranger, I am a ſad Knight named <hi>Angrioted' Eſtranaus,</hi> and this other is my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when King <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wales</hi> (who was there preſent) heard him ſpeake of <hi>Angriote,</hi> hee ſtarted from the table, and ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to the King, ſayde. Doth not your Maieſtie know Sir <hi>Angriote?</hi> ſuch as haue dealt with him, wil ſay he is one of the beſt knights in your Kingdome. My friend, quoth the king to <hi>Angriote,</hi> I pray you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and pardon me, if I haue not honoured you according to your deſerts: for the fault was only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted through ignorance, but be ſure you are welcome &amp; that with heart, but ſay I deſire ye, how came you acquainted with <hi>Amadis.</hi> My Lord, replyed <hi>Angriote,</hi> I haue knowne him no long time, and my firſt acquaintance was very deere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought, for I neuer thought to dye till I was wounded: but he that did me the harme, promiſed after-ward to giue me help, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry needfull now to cure me: hereto he added the whole accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as you heard it before. In ſooth, ſayde the king, I would be glad theſe matters ſhould haue a good end, but now come ſit downe with vs to dinner, afterward we will conſider thereon as we may. Next to king <hi>Arban</hi> was <hi>Angriote</hi> placed, and as they were about to riſe from the table, <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> the Dwarffe to <hi>Amadis</hi> entred the hall: whom <hi>Angriote</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, called him, demanding where he had left his Maiſter, becauſe he ſaw him laſt in his company. Sir, quoth the Dwarffe, whereſoeuer I haue left him, hee maketh good account of you: then falling on his knee before the King, hee thus began. <hi>Amadis</hi> my Lord humbly ſaluteth your Maieſtie, and all the reſt of his friends in this CCourt. Dwarffe, ſayd the king, where didſt thou leaue him? In ſuch a place my Lord, quoth the dwarffe, where he is of good cheere: but if you would knowe any more; it muſt be in the preſence of the Queene. With right good will, anſwered the King; and heereupon ſent preſently for the Queene, ſhee quickly comming, being atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on by diuers beautifull La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, the moſt part of them the amourous friends to the knights then wayting on the king, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they purchaſed leaue (during the Dwarffes diſcourſe) to deuiſe with them, at better leyſure, then longtime before they could: but the Dwarffe beholding the Queen preſent, thus proceeded. Madame,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7179:82"/>
my Lord and maſter <hi>Amadis</hi> in all humble reuerence ſaluteth your excellency, commanding mee to tell ye, that he hath found Prince <hi>Galaor</hi> his brother hee ſought for. Now truſt me, ſaid the Queene, I am heartily glad thereof. But on my credit Madame, quoth the Dwarffe, neuer was heard of ſuch a perillous meeting of two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, for if God had not the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prouided, both the one and the other had neuer beene ſeene againe, ſo neere were they both at the point of death: but by hap a good Knight arriued there, who names himſelfe <hi>Balays,</hi> and hee found the meanes to agree them. Then tolde hee all the whole acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, how <hi>Balays</hi> ſlew the Damoſel that procured their quarrell, for which, <hi>Balays</hi> was highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended of them all. But where haſt thou left them replyed the Queene? At the Caſtle of <hi>Carſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> Madame, ſayde the Dwarffe, where <hi>Balays</hi> dwelleth, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence I was diſpatched hither with this meſſage. But tel me Dwarff, quoth the Queene, what thinkeſt thou of <hi>Galaor?</hi> I thinke Madame anſwered the Dwarffe, that hee is one of the goodlieſt knights in the world, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a reſolution not one iot infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the beſt: and did you ſee him in company of my Lord, you could make little difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them.</p>
                  <p>I maruaile ſaide the Queene that they come not hither. Aſſure your ſefle, replied the Dwarffe, no ſooner ſhall they recouer health, but they will be here with you, for ſo they expreſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded me to tell yee. So ioyfull was the King hereof, that he minded to keepe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Court after they were come: commanding his Lords &amp; Barons not to depart his Court, whereto they all willingly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deſcended. He likewiſe deſired the Queen, to ſend for all the chiefe Ladies in the Realme: For the more honorably quoth hee, you are attended on by Ladies, the more Knights ſhall they finde heere to deſerue their loue, on whom I will beſtow many rich gifts and preſents.</p>

Departing thence, they rid toward <hi>Windſor,</hi> and after they had iourni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſiue dayes, they came into a foure corned way, in the middeſt whereof ſtood a tree, and vnder it a dead Knight lay on a rich bed, with great waxe tapers ſtanding burning at the boulſter and feete; which notwithſtanding any great winde could not be extinguiſhed. The dead knight was vnarmed, &amp; not couered with any thing, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7179:83"/>
eaſily might a great many wounds be deſerned on his head, and a trounchion of a Lance, peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the iron quite through his necke and throate: beſide, in ſuch manner did the dead Knight holde vp his hands thereon, as if he would haue pulled foorth the Lance. Greatly was <hi>Amadis</hi> and the reſt amazed hereat, and faine they would know what the knight ſhold bee, but they could ſee no body of whom they might enquire, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place neere that was inhabited, which moued <hi>Amadis</hi> thus to ſpeake. Doubtleſſe without ſome great occaſion, this knight was not brought into this place, beeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and furniſhed in this ſtrange manner: if wee ſtay heere a while, ſome aduenture or other muſt needes enſue thereon. And ſo think I, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> whereupon hee thus ſpake. Brother, this raſh oath, ſome-what diſpleaſeth me, for I doubt it will be an occaſion of our long tarying in this place. What I haue ſaid, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> is done: with theſe words he alighted from his horſe, and ſate downe at the dead knights feete: which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther twaine perceiuing, concluded not to leaue him, but euen to take ſuch part as he did.</p>
                  <p>Now was it between noone and euening, when they being thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, might at more eaſe viſite the wounds of the dead man: and <hi>Amadis</hi> ſeeing his hands on the trunchion in his throate, confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with griefe and maruaile, hee ſayd. Doubtleſſe hee yeelded his ſpirite as he now holdes his hands, becauſe they ſtill remaine in the place. And as they were thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning together, they heard a great noyſe of ſome comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, when preſently they eſpied a knight and two Squires, the one bearing a ſhielde and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and the other driuing a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell before him, ſhe giuing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhreekes and out-cryes, becauſe the knight ſmote her often with the end of his Launce: and thus they paſſed by the bed where the dead knight lay, when the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell ſawe the three knights by the coatſe, cryed. Ah good knight who lyeth on the bed, wert thou aliue, I am ſure thou wouldeſt not ſuffer me to bee thus cruelly handled, if hazarding thy body in a thouſand perrils might defend me: would God the death of theſe villaines had excuſed thine. Sayſt thou ſo? quoth the knight that vſed her ſo hardly, and thou ſhalt know the price of thy words: then ſmote her with his Lance ſo cruelly ouer the head, as made the blood in great aboundance to trickle downe her face, and ſo rode on ſtill beating her: which <hi>Amadis</hi> grieuing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, ſaid to his companions. In ſooth, neuer did I ſee ſuch a bad minded knight, to out-rage a poor Damoſell in ſuch pittifull manner: but (if God be my guide) he ſhall not long abuſe her ſo. Therefore brother, quoth he to <hi>Galaor,</hi> if I tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry too long, ſet forward I pray ye to <hi>Windſore</hi> with <hi>Balays,</hi> and I will come thither with what ſpeede I may: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mounting on horſe-back, hee commanded <hi>Gandalin</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and gallopped after the knight, who by this time had gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a great deale of ground.</p>
                  <p>Thus remained <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Balays</hi> alone there till night, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very darke, they could not ſee, but heard a knight come riding the ſame way which <hi>Amadis</hi> took, who complaning of griefe in his legge, lay holding himſelfe about his horſe necke, but when hee eſpied <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Balays,</hi> he demanded if
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7179:83"/>
they knew the knight that rid ſo faſt the ſame way he came. Why aske you? anſwered <hi>Galaor.</hi> Becauſe ſayd the knight, I would hee might breake his necke, for hee tunneth ſo rudely, as if hee followed ſome Diuell. What rudeneſſe hath hee offered you? anſwered <hi>Galaor.</hi> He would not tell mee, quoth the knight, neither by entreatance or other curteous meane, why hee made ſuch haſte: and I ſeeing him ſo ſelfe willed, layde holde on his horſe bridle, reſolued to make him pay for his boldnes, and to ſatisfie me either by friendſhip or force. Well, anſwered <hi>Balays,</hi> what did hee there tell ye? Nothing to my demand replyed the knight, but peremtorily thus ſpake. That hee would tarry no longer to tell mee, except I firſt combated with him. Hereupon we charged each other, he giuing me ſuch a ſhrewde puſh with his Lance, as I and my horſe were tombled quite ouer, and in the fall I brake my legge as you may beholde. When <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Balays</hi> heard his reporte, knowing full well hee ſpake of <hi>Amadis,</hi> they fell into a great laughter, ſaying. In good faith now are you taught againſt another time, not to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer importunate to knowe any thing againſt a mans will. Belike you mocke me then, anſwered the knight, and truſt mee you may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to repent it: then comming neere <hi>Galaors</hi> horſe, hee gaue him ſuch a blowe on his noſe, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him furiouſly to break his bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, gaue him liberty likewiſe to run about the field, and thinking he was not reuenged enough, ſought how to ſerue <hi>Balays</hi> horſe in the ſame ſorte, but they both ſtepped between with their Lances, &amp; kept him off: which the knight percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, giuing the ſpurs to his horſe, he rode away, ſaying. If I had ſped the other knight ſo well, I would haue thought my ſelfe halfe reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced: learne you then to ſtay me another time. Is it true, ſaid <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,</hi> and God neuer help me in my need, if I make thee not leaue thy horſe for the other thou haſt ſtay raunging. Preſently he leape into his ſaddle, deſiring <hi>Galaor</hi> to ſtay for him til morning, for then at the vttermoſt he hoped to returne.</p>
                  <p>By theſe accidents is <hi>Galaor</hi> left alone, attending newes of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he vowed: for hee had ſent his Squire to recouer his horſe, which by mishap tooke his way into a thicke woode. In meane while the greater part of the night is ſpent, &amp; <hi>Galaor</hi> could enioy no reſt, through extreame affection after his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe: but about breake of day hee found his ſpirits ſo ouer-watched, as (whether he would or no) he was complled to take off his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> &amp; ſhield, and leaning on them forgot himſelfe ſo much, that when hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked, hee neither ſaw the candles burning, or the dead knight which lay on the bed, whereat he became ſo ſorrowful, as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

thence the Knight, and walking on warily, as loth to faile thereof, he heard the neighing of a horſe: which made him ſhape his courſe thither-ward, albeit hee could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerne no body, yet paſſed he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe hee heard the like noiſe of other horſes. Not far had he gone, but he eſpied two Knights armed, one of them being alighted from his horſe, &amp; reading certeine letters engrauen on a ſtone, after-ward he ſayde to his companions. In vaine did they make mee come to this place, for I vnderſtand not one word of them: wherewith hee mounted againe, and they rode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way not ſeeing <hi>Galaor,</hi> but hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to them, ſaying. Gentlemen, can ye tell me who hath caryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a dead knight, who not long ſince, lay vnder a tree in the foure cornered ſtreete behinde? Verily, anſwered one of them, wee knowe nothing thereof, but about mid-night we ſaw three Damoſels paſſe by, and ten Squires with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting a litter. Which way did they take? ſaid <hi>Galaor.</hi> This on the left hand, replied the knight: ſo giuing them thankes, he went the ſame way he was directed, &amp; ſoon after ſaw a Damoſell comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, to whom he ſaid. It may be (Lady) you can tell me who hath caryed away the dead knight, that lay vnder the tree not farre hence. If you wil promiſe me, quoth ſhe, to reuenge his death, which is an exceeding great griefe to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: I will reſolue you therein. I will not ſtick for that, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> for it ſeemeth by your words, it is an act of iuſtice to do it. Very true, ſaid the Damoſell, mount vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me on my Palfary, and I ſhall direct ye to your deſire. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had ridden about two miles, ſhee ſhewed him a maruailous faire ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and alighting at the gate, ſhe bad him enter: But remember, quoth ſhe, what you haue promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And becauſe I haue ſolicited, you heereto, I pray yee let me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand your name. I am called <hi>Galaor,</hi> quoth hee, and thinke you ſhall heereafter finde mee in king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, then any where elſe. I am ſatisfied, ſaid the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, to God I commend yee: then ſhee turned bridle and rode away, but <hi>Galaor</hi> entred the caſtle, where he found the dead laid in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the Court, &amp; by him ſtood many making great lamentation. Neuertheleſſe <hi>Galaor</hi> approching neere, and ſtepping to an anciant knight, demanded of him what the dead knight was. Sir, anſwered the olde man, while hee liued hee was ſuch a one, as all the world may bemone his miſ-fortune. Do you know his name? ſaide <hi>Galaor.</hi> He is called <hi>Anthebon</hi> replied the other, one of the moſt vertuous Gentlemen that euer liued in <hi>Gaul.</hi> When <hi>Galaor</hi> heard he was a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to king <hi>Perion</hi> his father, his heart began to ſtorme, and as hee pittied him the more, ſo his deſire encreaſed to reuenge his death: whereupon hee entreated the knight to acquaint him with the truth of this tragicall accident: Sir, quoth he, this infortunate Gentleman which you ſee, was (in reſpect of his bounty and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue) maryed to a wife, who now lamenteth for him, ſhe being the Lady of this Caſtle. In time they had a very faire daughter, and ſhe growing in yeeres, was beloued by a knight, our too neere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: but the young Damoſell euer hated him, and aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could not abide him. Where-of the getting intelligence, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by ſome meane or other to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7179:84"/>
ſteale her hence, and being ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, (forgetting God, as alſo his owne honour) watched when this good knight, (as cuſtomely he vſed) ſhould goe to the cornered ſtreet there to ſucour ſuch as often were diſtreſſed, becauſe it is the moſt dangerous place in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
                  <p>Knowing him thus to bee from home, the diſloyall wretch entred this Caſtle, and finding the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in company of her mother, with diuerſe Gentlewomen heere diſporting: mauger them all, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly hee tooke her away, before wee could fall the bridge to ſuccor her. Hereupon (as wee afterward vnderſtood) ſhee did nothing day and dight but grieuouſly mourne, deſpiſing all the inticing blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the knight vſed to her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which in the end diſpleaſed him ſo much, as hee began in this ſort to reprooue her. Lady you know that I loue yee with all my heart, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring onely to haue the like of you, meaning no otherwiſe then hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to make you my wife: but you ſcornefully diſdaine me, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it I am diſcended of a more noble houſe then your father is, which maketh mee maruell very much, what ſhould moue you thus to bee mine enemy? In good faith I will tell yee, quoth ſhee. I heretofore made promiſe to my mother, and ſuch is ſtill my deliberation: that I would neuer match with any huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, if hee were not ſo good a knight, and comparable with my father in chiualry, for which ſhee made choyce of him among all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knights: to which wordes, he thus anſwered. By heauen I ſee you loue me now, for ere it bee long I will make ſufficient proofe, that I am a better man at armes then he. Within a while after, hee left his Caſtle, beeing well mounted and armed, placing himſelfe vnder the tree where you ſawe this knight dead, to what intent I cannot tell: but vnhappily the Lord of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle came that way, hauing left his horſe and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Armour, becauſe bee onely intended to take the ayre: The cowardly wretch ſeeing what aduantage hee had of him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the promiſe hee made his Lady, thought it place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to get him reputation; and no witneſſes by to report the contrary, ſo without giuing him warning, or ſpeaking one word to him, ſtealing behinde him, ſmote his Launce thorough his necke, as you he ere beholde.</p>
                  <p>Thus, vnprouided of defence, likewiſe ſuddenly and moſt villai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly, was this good knight ſlain: and yet the blody traytour not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risfied, alighting from his horſe, gaue him many needleſſe cruell woundes with his ſworde, and ſo deſpitefully left him there. In good faith; anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> the deede is monſtrous, vnable to paſſe with-out common reprehenſion: but ſeeing you haue vouchſafed mee this fauour, I pray ye tell me, why was he afterwarde laide on ſuch a coſtly bed vnder the tree? Becauſe it being a continuall paſtàge for knights errant, ſaid the olde man, to try if any would be ſo honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prouoked, as to reuenge an act of ſuch ſhame and tontempt, after wee had acquainted them with this ſad diſcouſe. I found him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone at the tree, replyed <hi>Galaor,</hi> what was the cauſe then you left him ſo? Your de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

them, we were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to bring away the body hither. I maruell, ſayde <hi>Galaor,</hi> that I heard not the noyſe, it may well bee ſayd I ſlept ſoundly. Are you he, replyed the old man, whom we found leaning aſleep on your helmet? The very ſame man, anſwered <hi>Galaor.</hi> Why did you reſt ſo homely there? quoth the old man. To reuenge his death, ſayd <hi>Galaor,</hi> if by reaſon I might doe ſo much. Ah worthy Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the old man, heauen grant the finiſhing thereof to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: then taking him by the hand, he brought him to the bed whereon the dead man lay, thus ſpeaking to the ſorrowfull Lady. Madame, this knight ſaith (to his power) he will reuenge the death of your Lord. Alas gentle knight quoth ſhe, the God of heauen keepe you in that good minde, for I can finde no kinred or friend in this countrey, who will doe ſo much for me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my Lord was a ſtranger: yet whlie he liuid, euery one ſhewed great friendſhip in lookes, but now their kindnes is cold enough. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> in reſpect both he and I were borne in one countrie, my deſire is the greater to reuenge his death. Are you, ſaid the Lady, the ſonne to King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Galaoe,</hi> whom my deceaſed Lord often told me was in king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court? Neuer came I there Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, replyed <hi>Galaor,</hi> in all my life: but tell me what he is that did this treaſon, and in what place I may find him? Gentle Lord, quoth ſhe, you ſhall be conducted thither if you pleaſe: neuertheleſſe I ſtand in doubt, (conſidering the perill) you will miſlike the enterpriſe, as many others haue done, who were heretofore accompanied thither. Herein Madame, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> is the difference between good and bad, yet if you will allow mee ſo much, as you did them that made refuſal, happily I may ſpeede better then they did. The Lady noting his honourable diſpoſition, called two of her Damoſels, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to conduct <hi>Galaor</hi> to the knight that held her daughter perforce. In ſooth Madame, ſayd the Prince, little credite ſhall you haue by ſending me on foote, my owne horſe I loſt (not long ſince) in the woode by hard fortune: I pray ye then let mee haue another on this condition, that if I reuenge not your cauſe, I may ſtand bound to deliuer him againe. You ſhall haue one Sir, anſwered the Lady, for I hope by your proweſſe: not onely our poſſeſſions ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine at your diſpoſing, but our ſelues likewiſe your obedient ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</p>

death. Tell me his name, replyed <hi>Galaor.</hi> Hee is called <hi>Palingues,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Damoſels. Being now come hard by the Caſtle, they ſaw the gate was faſt, which made <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> call out aloud, whereat an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Knight came on the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, demanding what he fought for. I would enter the Caſtle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Galaor.</hi> This gate, quoth hee, is appointed to no other end, but for the comming forth of ſuch as remaine heere within. Which way ſhall I enter then? ſaid <hi>Galaor.</hi> I will ſhew you, quoth the Knight: But I doubt I ſhall trauell in vaine, and that you dare not come to vs. Now truſt mee, replied <hi>Galaor,</hi> I would faine haue beene within long ſince. Wee ſhall quickly ſee that, ſayd the Knight, if your har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe be ſuch as you make ſhew of: alight from your horſe, and come neer the Caſtle wall. Which <hi>laor</hi> did, giuing his horſe to the Damoſels, went to the place where hee was appointed.</p>
                  <p>Then came the Knight againe and another with him, ſeeming of greater ſtature then his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: they two winding a winche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, ouer the wall let downe a basket with a cord, ſaying to the Prince. If you will enter here, the paſſage by the basket is this high way. But if I put my ſelfe therein, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> will yee promiſe to draw me vp in ſafety? Yea true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, quoth they, albeit afterwarde wee will not warrant yee. Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their wordes, hee entered the basket, ſaying. Drawe mee vp, for on your honeſt promiſe I aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Herewith they beganne to winde vp the basket, which the Damoſels ſeeing, marueling not a little at <hi>Galaors</hi> hardineſſe, ſayde. Ah good, Knight God ſhield thee from treaſon, for doubtleſſe thou ſheweſt a gentle and valiant heart.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Knights had drawen him vp, taking him and the basket in at the top, afterwards the knights thus began with him. Gentleman, it is neceſſary you ſweare to aide the Lord of this Caſtle, againſt ſuch as would quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with him for the death of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thebon,</hi> otherwiſe you neuer ſhall depart hence. What? ſayd <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor.</hi> Did one of you twaine kill him? Why demand you? reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the other. Becauſe, quoth hee, I am come to let the murderer knowe, how hee hath committed a deed of horrible treaſon. Come yee for that intent? ſayd they, now ſurely you might haue beene a great deale better aduiſed: Dareſt thou threaten vs, and art in our cuſtody? alas, wee muſt haue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of account at thy hands, &amp; we muſt chaſtice the folly wherewith thy braine is troubled: then drawing their ſwordes, they layde vpon him very furiouſly. When <hi>Galaor</hi> ſawe himſelfe thus wronged both in words and deeds, hee entred into ſuch choller, as quickely hee made them feele the edge of his ſword, ſo that the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels might eaſily heare the clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the ſtroakes on the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: for the two knights were ſtrong and vigorous, and <hi>Galaor</hi> well mooued with hot diſpleaſure. Ah God, quoth one of the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, harke how the worthy knight dealeth with the traytors, let vs not depart hence till wee ſee ſome end thereof. All this while <hi>Galaor</hi> ſo laboured his enemies with ſuch ſharpe charges, as their hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſomewhat to deſpaire, for to one of them hee gaue ſuch a blow on the helmet, as his ſword entred three fingers deepe intothis head:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7179:86"/>
afterard hee buffeted him with the hilts of his ſword, that hee made him fall on his knees to the ground. In meane ſpace the other ſpared not <hi>Galaor,</hi> but layd loade on him to reuenge his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe head the Prince had now ſeuered from his ſhoulders: and comming to the other, the coward began to turne his backe, running downe the ſtaires faſter then euer hee came vp: but <hi>Galaor</hi> followed ſo nimbly, that laying holde on him, hee made him ſure for euer letting downe the basket againe, to drawe vp any more knights on the wals.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe the Prince knewe not <hi>Palingues,</hi> and doubting one of theſe twaine to be he, he threw them ouer the battlements to the Ladies, bidding them to looke on them &amp; afterward to reſolue him: but they anſwered they were ſo mangled as they could not iudge of them, and they were perſwaded that <hi>Palingues</hi> was neither of theſe twaine. Whereupon <hi>Galaor</hi> went downe into the Caſtle, and as hee looked euery where about him, he eſpied a faire young Lady, who cryed aloud: <hi>Palingues, Palingues,</hi> is this the great chiualry for which thou wouldeſt be renowned? now thou flyeſt like a cowardly and faint hearted knight, yet ſayeſt thou wert a better man at armes then my murdered father, whom thou killedſt (as thou vaunteſt) in combate hand to hand. In ſooth what euer I doubted is now come to paſſe: why doſt thou not attend this Knight who looketh for thee? if there be any manly heart or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in thee, ſhew it now in need when thy life depends thereon. At theſe words <hi>Galaor</hi> looked more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and eſpied <hi>Palingues</hi> well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, who was opening the doore of a Tower to ſaue himſelfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſtepped to him, ſaying. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue mee Knight, this flying wil little aduantage thee, and leſſe the ſtrong holde thou wouldeſt enter into: for thou muſt anſwer the life of good <hi>Anthebon,</hi> whoſe death thou diddeſt compaſſe by mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous villany. <hi>Palingues</hi> ſeeing there was no other remedy, turned and fiercely ſmote at <hi>Galaor,</hi> his ſworde entring ſo farre into the Princes ſhield, as he was not able to pull it out againe: by meanes whereof <hi>Galaor</hi> reached him ſuch a blowe, that therewith his right arme was cut quite from his body, the griefe whereof ſo pained him, as hee ran into the chamber where the Ladie was, thinking by this poore ſhift to defend his life. But <hi>Galaor</hi> getting hold on his legges, dragged him along on his backe out againe, and with his ſworde ſmote his head from his ſhoulders. This is, quoth hee, the rewarde of thy treacheries done to <hi>Anthebon,</hi> and payment for thy treaſon in the action of his death.</p>
                  <p>The daughter of <hi>Anthebon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent at this deede, hauing heard <hi>Galaor</hi> often name her father, fell on her knees before him with theſe words. Alas my Lord, you haue bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d me in ſuch duty to you, as neuer ſhall I be able to require your paines, my ſelfe being of ſuch ſimple and ſlender ability: but the good will I haue to recompence this benefit, hath imprinted daily prayers in my heart to God for you, hauing ſo iuſtly reuenged the death of my father, and the wrongfull forcing of this tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. <hi>Galaor</hi> curteouſly taking her vp, embracing her in his armes, thus anſwered. On my faith faire friend, hee were a man of little ſence, that would offer
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7179:86"/>
diſpleaſure to ſuch a one as you are, ſeeing you much bettet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to be loued and ſerued, then with griefe or fauour to bee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but tell mee, haue you any more enemies in this Caſtle? No Sir, replyed the Damoſell, thoſe which remaine, are to doe you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and obeyſance. Let vs goe then, quoth hee, to let in two Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels, who were my guides hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from your Lady mother. So taking him by the hand, ſhee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the gate to bee opened, &amp; the two Damoſels entered leading <hi>Galaors</hi> horſe: but when they ſawe their yong Miſtreſſe, they humbly made her reuerence, demanding if her fathers death were reuenged to her deſire. Yea verily, quoth ſhee, I thanke God and this knight, who hath done that many other could not doe.</p>
                  <p>It was now the vehement hot time of the day, wherefore <hi>Galaor</hi> tooke off his helmet to refreſh him ſelfe, when the Lady ſeeing him ſo young and beautifull, as alſo ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant in deedes of armes: began to bee touched with loue, and ſetting aſide both feare and baſhfulneſſe, ſhee began to imbrace and kiſſe him, ſaying. My honorable Lord &amp; friend, more cauſe haue I to loue you then any other creature li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. In good faith, quoth he, and I loue you likewiſe, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of your beauty and good grace, as alſo for your deceaſed fathers ſake, he and I being borne in one Countrie. May if it pleaſe ye Sir, ſayde ſhee, to tell mee your name? Such as are acquainted with mee, anſwered the Prince, tearme mee <hi>Galaor.</hi> In ſooth my Lord, quoth ſhee, often haue I heard my father ſpeake of Sir <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> your brother, and of you likewiſe, ſaying you were the ſons to the King of <hi>Gaul,</hi> his liege Lord and Soueraigne. At thus they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, they entered alone into a chamber, while the Damoſels with the reſt were pouiding viands: wherefore <hi>Galaor</hi> ſeeing time and place ſo commodious, to requeſt the loue of her that vſed him ſo kindly, ſhee being a Lady, young, freſh and faire, named <hi>Brandueta:</hi> himſelfe likewiſe actiue and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of ſuch ſweete baytes, thus ſpake. Madame, if <hi>Palingues</hi> loued you as I haue heard, hee had great reaſon for it, knowing you to bee ſuch a one as I ſee you are: for my ſelfe, who haue ſo little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with you, am already ſo deepe in deuotion to your graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, as I would repute my ſelfe happy, if you granted me the fauour I deſire, accepting mee as your friend and ſeruant.</p>
                  <p>The Lady not one iot behinde him in amorous affection, ſhaped him this anſwere. I haue tolde yee my Lord, that I loue you more then any other liuing creature, therefore you may be certainely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, how my deſire is to pleaſe you in all things whatſoeuer. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe ſpeeches, <hi>Galaor</hi> ſtill held his loue in his armes, kiſſing and toying with her ſo pleaſantly, as <hi>Diana</hi> ſoone after loſt her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the maiden, whereto <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueta</hi> yeelded with greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, then all her former reſiſtances to <hi>Palingues:</hi> from whom ſhee kept her virginity ſo long, that ſhee was now content to beſtow it on the <hi>French</hi> Prince, and hee hauing a good ſtomacke to ſuch dainty dyet, made her loue him the better for it while ſhe liued.

                  <p>As they ſate at the table, and diſcourſed of many matters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things <hi>Brandueta</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to him, how <hi>Palingues</hi> (ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in feare of him and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Amadis)</hi> cauſed this Caſtle to be kept ſo ſtrongly: conſidering that her Father <hi>Anthebon</hi> was of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and king <hi>Perions</hi> ſubiect, the ſooner would they aſſay to worke reuenge for his death. For this reaſon, quoth ſhe, hee allowed no other entrance then by the basket into this Caſtle, where I haue liued in maruailous griefe and ſorrowe, as neuer ſhall I deſire to tarry here longer: therefore right gentle Lord and friend, might it ſo like you, without any longer ſtay I would gladly ſee my mother, who will not bee a little glad of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and yours likewiſe. <hi>Galaor</hi> was very well contented, and though it were late, yet got they to horſe-backe, departing from the Caſtle: but for all their haſte they were two houres benighted, which brake no ſquare in reſpect of the good newes, the good Lady with all her family ioyfully recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them, with all honourable meanes could bee deuiſed, beſide, the comforted widow caſt herſelfe at his feete, vſing theſe ſpeeches.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue heard what haſle <hi>Amadis</hi> made after the Damoſell, whom the knight led away perforce, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and miſuſing her very cruelly: but hee happened to meet with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Knight, who demanded of him why he rid ſo faſt. What haue you to do? anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be my pleaſure to ride faſt or ſoft. In good faith, ſaid the knight,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7179:88"/>
Iſpeake it as one willing to helpe you, if you be offered wrong by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that you may goe in better aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urance if you bee affraid. Truely you may ſpare this labour, replyed <hi>Amadis,</hi> for at this time I haue no neede of your helpe. When the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heard this anſwer, hee imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that <hi>Amadis</hi> mocked him, which made him come and lay holde on the bridle of his horſe, ſaying. By God Sir, you ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere my demand, otherwiſe, I meane to breake your pace. I know not what thou canſt doe, quoth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> but I will diſpatch my ſelfe of thee by combate, and that way reſolue thee in thy requeſt: for raſh mindes muſt haue rough medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and ſuch as ſeeke to knowe more then they neede, often feele more then they would. So fetching their carrire, the Knight ſhiuering his Launce in pieces: but <hi>Amadis</hi> ſent both horſe and man to the ground, and with ſuch violence, as the Knights legge was broken in the fall, and <hi>Amadis</hi> had leaſure to follow his iourney: this was the man you heard of before, that made <hi>Galaors</hi> Squire goe looke his maiſters horſe.</p>
                  <p>But now to proceede with <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> who tarryed not to helpe the Knight vp againe, ſuch ſpeed made he after his intent, as at length hee ouer-tooke him that led away the Damoſell, &amp; comming neere him, thus ſpake. Forbeare Sir I pray ye, and wrong the Ladie no more. What wrong haue I done her? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Knight. The moſt ſhamefulleſt, ſavde <hi>Amadis,</hi> could be deuiſed. What? quoth the Knight, you would then chaſtiſe me? No Sir, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> but aduiſe ye by reaſon for your owne benefit. I heare yee well enough, ſaid the Knight, but you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne as wife as you came. It is true, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> then ſtepping to the Squire that led the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels Palfray; he ſtearnely ſayd. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, let the woman alone, or thou dyeſt the death. The Squire being affraid, fled away, which the knight ſeeing, and being very angry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, hee came to <hi>Amadis</hi> with theſe words. Beleeue me Sir, you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand very audatiouſly: but if I know not how to charme ſuch bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, let armour neuer come on my backe againe. So placing their Launces in their reſts, they brake their ſtaues in the encounter: but the knight was caſt headlong out of his faddle, and before he could recouer him ſelfe againe, <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtood ready with his ſword to take his life, which he perceiuing, and that he muſt bee forced to beg his pardon, thus ſpake. Goode Sir take pittie on mee, and looke what of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence I haue committed by any hard dealing, ſhall be amended by better vſage.

The night induring all this while, yet comfortably lightned by faire <hi>Cynthia,</hi> whereby the Damoſell ſawe the death of her aduerſary, which made her fall at the princes feete with theſe wordes. Alas wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy knight, the God of heauen (not I) muſt requite this honourable kindneſſe, for without your helpe, much better had death beene to mee then life: yet let mee requeſt this further curteſie, no more but your company to a Caſtle not far hence, where I ſhall be in ſafety to my owne deſire, and to trauell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone thither will be dangerous for mee. Nor ſhall you faire Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> be in ſuch feare, for I will not leaue yee till you be where you would: ſo hee willed <hi>Gandalin</hi> to bring him the knights horſe, and to helpe the Damoſell on her palfray, afterward they rode as ſhee conducted them. Of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matters they conferred by the way, ſhee acquainting him with the whole hiſtory of the dead knight, whoſe death you haue heard how <hi>Galaor</hi> reuenged. And comming into a meddowe by a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſide, they alighted from their horſes, betaking themſelues to ſleepe a little, becauſe it was night, ſhee lying on a mantle that <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> ſpread for her, and <hi>Amadis</hi> leaning on his helmet as his beſt pillowe.

Yea marry, quoth the knight, and taking her by the hand mounted her vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him. Why doe ye ſo? ſaid the Damoſell, your Squire might helpe mee to mine owne horſe, without troubling you in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It were needleſſe, anſwered the knight, for ſeeing a booty is ſo well offered, I meane to haue the carriage of it my ſelfe. Theſe wordes made the Damoſell ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect her ſelfe deceiued, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king backe, ſhee behelde where <hi>Amadis</hi> lay faſt aſleepe, wherefore ſhe cryed out ſo loud as ſhe could. Ah helpe me Sir, quoth ſhee, for heere is one I knowe not will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly carry mee away. When the knight heard what a noyſe ſhee made, hee gaue the ſpurres to his horſe, riding away in a maine gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop: but <hi>Amadis</hi> awaking and not ſeeing the Damoſell, was greatly diſpleaſed, haſtily calling <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> to bring him his horſe, afterward hee poſted the ſame way the knight had taken. At length hee got a ſight of them, marking their entrance into a thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of trees where he miſtooke his way in ſuch ſort, as hee knew not which ſide of the woode to take: when (though hee was one of the moſt patient men in the world) he conceiued this griefe marueilous vnkindly, ſaying to himſelfe. Now may the Damoſel well report, that I haue done her as much ſhame as ſuccour: for if I defended her from one forcer, by my ſloathful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe I haue left her in the power of one worſe then he.</p>
                  <p>Thus riding in and out among the brambles, offering much iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to his horſe, at length he heard the winding of a horne, which made him follow the ſound there-of, imagining the knight did it for his pleaſure. Soone after hee eſpied a ſtrong Caſtle on the top
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7179:89"/>
of a mountayne, and approaching neere perceiued it was begirt with a high wall, whereon were many great Towers, and the gate made ſure with mighty barres. As hee was ſeeking ſome place of ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the watch diſcrying him, ſaid. What man at ſo late an houre commeth armed ſo neere? I am a ſtrange knight, anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> What would you haue? ſayde the watch. I ſeeke for one, quoth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> who not long ſince tooke a Damoſell from mee. Wee ſawe none ſuch, anſwered the watch. Hereupon <hi>Amadis</hi> paſſed further, and diſcerned a little doore open, and the Damoſell with the knight to enter thereat on foot, becauſe they could not come neere it on horſe-backe: then <hi>Amadis</hi> calling to the knight, thus ſpake. Stay a while I pray you Sir, and tell mee before you ſhut the gate, if you be the man that tooke a Damofell from mee? If I tooke her from you, anſwered the knight, you had the leſſe care of her keeping. And the leſſe manhood, ſayde <hi>Amadis,</hi> was in you, to ſteale her from mee while I ſlept, beeing aſſured you could no otherwiſe haue carryed her from me ſo lightly. My friend, quoth the knight, I haue her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, and of her owne good will ſhe came with mee, without any manner of ſoliciting or forcing. In good faith, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> if you ſhew her me, and ſhee affirme as much, I ſhall reſt contented. It is not long to morning, ſayde the knight, and then I will let yee ſee her here, if you will enter vpon the cuſtome of the Caſtle? What is the cuſtome? replyed <hi>Amadis.</hi> You ſhall be tolde it, quoth the knight, and I thinke you will finde it too hard for your enterpriſing. If I would preſently agree thereto? ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> might I now enter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not as yet, anſwered the knigh: but if you tarry till day light, wee ſhall behold what you can doe. So going in, he clapped too the door, wherefore <hi>Amadis</hi> was contented to awaire the breake of day, vnder a tuft of trees hard by the Caſtle, and when the Sunne began no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, hee heard the gate open, which made him quickely mount on horſe-backe: then comming forwarde, hee ſaw a knight armed at all points, and vnder him a luſty courſer, whereupon the Porter cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Amadis,</hi> demanding if he would enter. Why haue I tatryed heere elſe, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> all this while? But firſt, quoth the Porter, you muſt vnderſtand our cuſtome, to the ende you may not ſay after-warde that you were deceiued. I therefore thus aduiſe ye, how whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſhall be entred here, you muſt enter combate with this knight, and if he get the victory, you muſt ſweare to doe the commandement of a Lady heere within, or elſe be committed to a miſerable priſon. If hee chance to be vanquiſhed, it is nothing in reſpect, for you muſt be commanded to another gate, and there enter combate with two other, whom if your fortune like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be ſo good as to ouer come: you haue then to deale with three other, they being right valiant and tryed men at armes, and all theſe you muſt fight againſt vnder the firſt condition: but if you beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the honour in each of theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, right ſhall bee done in whatſoeuer you demand. On theſe conditions, replyed <hi>Amadis,</hi> I am well content to enter, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe I would ſee the man, who tooke the Damoſell from me this night paſt.</p>
                  <p>So ſoone as hee was entred, the

firſt Knight and he ento untred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: but <hi>Amadis</hi> ouertbrew his enemy ſo ſuriouſly, as his right arme was broken in the fall, which made him glad to yeelde for ſafety of his life. At the ſecond gate hee found the other two ready tarrying for him, threatening him with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if he did not well defend him-ſelfe: I muſt buy my libertie, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> with your deereſt blood, keepe it therefore from me ſo well as you can. Then couering them-ſelues with their ſhields, hee met one of them ſo directly that he fell to the ground, and his horſe vpon him, very ſore ſhaken and bruſed with his fall, then comming to the other with his ſword drawne, hee ſmote the helmet quite beſide his head, when being loth to proceed any further with him, he ſaid. Now truſt me knight, it is the greateſt folly in the world to fight, thy head being bare. Care not you for that, anſwered the knight, I will keepe as ſafe as you ſhall do yours. And I wil trie your cunning, quoth <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis:</hi> then ſtriking a full blow at him, which the knight ſhifting his body aſide to eſcape, loſt his ſtirrops and fell beſide his horſe, when <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> quickly ſtepping to him, got holde of him by the necke, ſaying. See knight how well thou defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thy head, art thou not well worthy to looſe it for thy wordes? When the knight ſaw what danger he was in, he fell on his knee, and thus ſpake to the Prince. Ah wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Sir, for Gods ſake mercy, and ſeeing you haue ſo well aduiſed me, neuer will I hereafter bee ſo raſh in folly, therefore I yeeld my ſelfe to your mercy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> being thus pacified, took a freſh Lance &amp; mounted on horſe-back againe, riding now to the laſt gate, where he eſpied La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes and Gentlewomen on the wales, who ſaid to each other: If he paſſe the bridge in deſpite of our guardants, hee ſhall performe a moſt rare deede of Chiualrie? While thus they communed, the three knights came foorth to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile <hi>Amadis,</hi> the firſt of them vſing theſe words. Knight yeeld thy ſelfe, or ſweare to doe the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Lady. Theſe are but wordes, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> from which I can defend my ſelfe well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: I cannot put on the minde to yeeld my ſelfe, or accompliſh the Ladyes will you ſpeake of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know not what ſhe is. Here-upon a fierce combate began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Prince and the three, who ſhewing themſelues to bee right hardy knights, and <hi>Amadis</hi> full loth to receiue the foyle, made a long doubtfull iudgement of victory: till at length by many wounds &amp; great loſſe of blood, the knights were able to holde out no longer, flying into the caſtle for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety of themſelues, yet one of them fell downe by the way, whom <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> ſware ſhould die if hee yeelded not preſently. Alas my Lord, quoth he, with all my heart I ſubmit my ſelfe, and ſo ought all other to do that combate againſt you, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your happy fortune ſince you came to this Caſtle. With theſe words hee deliuered his ſword to the Prince, who gaue it him again, and followed the other twaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pallace, where hee met di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Ladies and Damoſels, when the choyce of them all in beauty, thus ſpake to him. Stay awhile Sit knight if you pleaſe, for alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy you haue done ſo much, as you ſhall obtaine what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.

This man of whom we ſpeake, was Vncle germaine to <hi>Angriotes</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, named <hi>Gaſinan,</hi> ſhee louing and honouring him aboue all her other kinred: for hee was the beſt Knight of his race, wiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete, ſo that ſhee was altogether gouerned by his counſell. A good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly horſe beeing brought forth for him, hee laced on his helmet, and ſtood prouided to enter the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: which <hi>Groueneſa</hi> the Lady perceiuing, ſhe came to her Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle with theſe wordes. Certes my Lord, it were better you ſhould forbeare this difference, becauſe I would bee ſory any harme ſhould come to either of you, in reſpect you Vncle are the only man of the world, whom I am moſt bound to loue: and this knight I haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt hope in, for he hath promiſed to deale with <hi>Amadis,</hi> as hee ſhall acquite the offer made to <hi>Angrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.</hi> What Neece? anſwered <hi>Gaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> thinke you that hee or any his like, can diſſwade the moſt gentle Knight on the earth from accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing his promiſe? I know not quoth ſhee, what you imagine of him, but I repute him one of the beſt in the worlde: otherwiſe hee could not haue entered heere by ſtrength of Armes as hee did. Say you ſo? replyed <hi>Gaſinan,</hi> you praiſe him ouer much, for paſſing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended gates, when men of ſuch mean account had them in charge. I ſay not this, but that hee may be a gentle Knight, yet I hope to take him forth a new leſſen, and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he if he were here: in wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my wordes, your ſelfe ſhal preſently be iudge, ſeeing him van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, and my ſelfe peaceably poſſeſſed of the Damoſel we quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell for. Herewith the Lady left them, and they giuing the ſpurres to their horſes, brake their Lances gallantly in the encounter, and with ſuch fury met their bodies, that <hi>Gaſinan</hi> was diſmounted, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a ſhrewd fall againſt the ground: yet he aroſe quickly, and drawing his ſworde, ſtood by a Marble pillar in the middeſt of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7179:91"/>
Court, thinking <hi>Amadis</hi> could there little endomge him being on horſe-backe, and hee on foote. When <hi>Amadis</hi> ſawe how his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my dallied with him, he waxed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angry, and ſtriking fiercely at him, by miſhap his ſworde lighted ſhort on the pillar, and ſo was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in three peeces: now grew he into greater choller, and ſeeing in what danger hee was, vnprouided of a weapon to deſend himſelfe withall, hee leaped from his horſe ſo quickely as hee could, when <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinan</hi> thus ſpake to him. Knight, thou ſeeſt thy death at hand, if thou grant not the Damoſell to be mine. Nor will I yeelde thereto, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> vnleſſe herſelfe doe firſt conſent. Thou ſhalt ſee, quoth <hi>Gaſinan,</hi> how deere this fooliſh humor will coſt thee With theſe wordes he deliuered him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſharpe ſtroakes, but <hi>Amadis</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded them very cunningly, ſo that the moſt of them were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in vaine rather wearying his enemy, then doing him any harme. And ſo long endured the combate, as the beholders were not a little amazed thereat, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that <hi>Gaſinan</hi> got not the victorie all the while, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what aduantage hee had of the Prince: but <hi>Amadis</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with himſelfe (being thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely handled) to hazard ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſpeedy conqueſt, then a liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring ſhame, and therefore ranne violently vpon <hi>Gaſinan,</hi> getting faſt holde about his body ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, as he had ſcant leaſure to lift his armes for reſiſtance, but was conſtrained to let fall his ſworde and ſtruggle with <hi>Amadis,</hi> who griped him terribly, ſo ſtroue they to ouerthrow each other. But <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> threw him with ſuch might againſt the Marble pillar, that hee was not able to ſtirre hand or foot; and afterward tab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

With aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of teares trickling downe her cheekes, ſhee came and fell at the feete of <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſhewing the affection of her requeſt, and her inwarde griefe to beholde her Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles death: all which <hi>Amadis</hi> well noting, feigned himſelfe more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to kill him then before, ſaying.

                  <p>As thus they rode communing together, he ſawe a knight come towarde him, carrying his legge on his horſes necke, but drawing neerer, he put foote in ſtirrop, couching his Launce againſt <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,</hi> and running at him, threwe him and the Damoſell both from the horſe, afterward he vſed theſe ſpeeches. In ſooth Lady, I am ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for your fall, but to amend the wrong I haue done ye, I will bring yee where you ſhall be contented, becauſe he that hath the charge of you, is vnworthy to haue ſo faire a creature in his cuſtody. Ere this had <hi>Balays</hi> recouered himſelfe, and knowing him to bee the knight he ſought for, hee drew his ſworde ſaying. By thee villaine haue I loſt my horſe, and my companion thou haſt in like ſorte abuſed, now fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding mee vnprouided, thou takeſt delight in offering me wrong: but both for him and my ſelfe will I be reuenged on thee, elſe let mee be thought vnworthy of my order. What? quoth the knight, art thou one of them that mocked mee as I rid in the darke? I hope now I haue put the mockerie on thee. Heereupon they preſently fell to combate, and many ſharpe blowes were giuen on either ſide, till <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays</hi> at length faſtning holde on his enemy, got him vnder foot, when renting his helmet from his head, hee tooke his life as ranſome for his villany: and breaking his ſword in peeces, layd them by him, then mounting on his horſe, and the Damoſell on her owne, they tooke their way toward the tree where he left <hi>Galaor.</hi>

                  <p>But becauſe their ſtomacks well ſerued them to meat, they alighted at a little Lodge, where dwelt two women of auſtere and holy life, who beſtowed on them ſuch cheer as they had the Damoſell acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with all her mishap, and how <hi>Balays</hi> deliuered her from the theeues, at what time they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to diſhonor her hauing ſlaine her ſeruants, and ſhee deſtitute of helpe, whereof the holy women were very glad, by reaſon thoſe theeues did much harme in that countrey. After they had refreſhed themſelues, <hi>Balays</hi> and the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell took their leaue, and comming to the tree, met <hi>Amadis</hi> there new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned from his enterpriſe: wherefore they concluded no more to ſunder themſelues, vntill they arriued at King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court. By this time the night drew on apace, whereupon the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell earneſtly intreated them, to lodge that night at her Fathers which was not farre off: they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king well of her friendly offer, went with her, beeing there entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vſed very honourably.

All this while was the Queene in place, earneſtly wiſhing that the king her husband might haue it, where-upon ſhe ſaide to the king. Me-thinkes (my Lord) it would full well become your Maieſtie, if you may haue it at ſo eaſie a rate as he demandeth.

A vertue of cheef regard, anſwered the Queen, if it haue any ſuch indeede? I haue tolde ye true, Madame, quoth the knight, if you will buy it, you may proue.

Here-with <hi>Amadis</hi> caſt downe his lookes as haſhfull to heare himſelf ſo prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by her to whom all commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was due: and feeling his ſpirits altered, ſtroue to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, but the words died in his mouth, which cauſed <hi>Oriana</hi> thus to proceede. How can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe my Lord, but I muſt needes loue you aboue all other, when they that neuer ſaw you, do highly loue, honor, and eſteeme you? and I being ſhee whom you affect moſt decrely, haue I not great reaſon to loue you better then my ſelfe? On my faith Madam, anſwered <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> your ſweete and gentle words, are ſufficient to make mee die a thouſand deaths, &amp; as many times to reuiue me againe: but how? I pray you at this time onely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my extremity with pitty, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during worſe then death by louing you too vehemently: for if I had died as <hi>Arcalaus</hi> reported, euen then had begun my reſt and quier, if I had not known you before. And albeit the houre of your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is my intire felicity, yet am I aſſaulted with ſuch violent paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as my heart would altogether conſume in grieſe, without the pleaſure it receiueth in doing you ſeruice, and the good it ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by your remembrance of me. But neceſſity conſtraineth me, to craue the mercy as yet vndeſerued, by ſuch intreatance as no deſert may value, onely to increaſe my hability in ſeruing you, which if you grant me not, a ſudden and cruell death will take hold on me. Theſe words were accompanied with ſuch aboundance of teares, as was no ſmall griefe to her to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. Alas my Lord, quoth ſhe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare theſe often repetitions of your death, the thought there of is inſupportable to mee, for ſhould you die, I were vnable to liue one houre after: conſidering all the pleaſure I haue in this world, is in the ioy of your health and welfare. Nor can I but be aſſured of your words, by reaſon mine owne caſe is ſufficient therein, being copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with you in euery torment: but if yours ſeeme more violent, this is the reaſon, my will being equall with yours, wanteth the ſtrength you haue in ſuffering, &amp; cannot ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the deſire of our hearts, which vrgeth loue and grieſe more in you then me, albeit my ſhare is not one iote the leſſe. But this I promiſe you on my faith, if for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or our owne endeauour, can compaſſe no meane to yeelde vs content, my ſelfe will ſearch ſome way whatſoeuer happen, bee it hate of Father, Mother, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; Friends: for we may not thus procraſtinate our ioy, and groane vnder the weighty burden of deſire the flame whereof climeth ſo high, as the martyrdome of our hearts may eaſily bee diſcouered. No doubt theſe wordes were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to <hi>Amadis,</hi> and gaue ſuch cheerefull life to his hope, that hee was rauiſhed with inwarde
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7179:96"/>
conceit thereof: when ſhee ſeeing him mute, trode vpon his foote, ſaying. Diſeomfort not your ſelfe my Lord, for I will not fayle what I haue promiſed, nor ſhall you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part till you perceiue it: and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will the King hold open Court, when both he and the Queen muſt depend on your aſſiſtance, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well that your preſence ſhall honour the company.</p>
                  <p>As they would haue continued in longer talke, the Queene called <hi>Amadis,</hi> cauſing him to ſit downe by <hi>Galaor,</hi> for the King was gone to his chamber. Then began the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to cenſure on the brethren, but they reſembled each other ſo like, as little difference could bee diſcerned betweene them: euery one being of the opinion, that theſe twayne were the moſt perfect amongſt all Knights, both in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nobleneſſe, bounty, and good grace: but <hi>Galaor</hi> was ſomewhat whiter in complexiion; and <hi>Amadis</hi> of bigger bone, his locks more criſpt and faire, and hauing a little more red in his face then <hi>Galaor</hi> had. Soone after, the Queene wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Galaor</hi> to go ſee her daughter and the other Ladies, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the excellent beauty of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> imagined ſuch another was not to be found in the world, and by her often ſighing with alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of colour, he ſuſpected her to be the onely cauſe, that his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liked ſo well to ſtay in King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court. Right courteouſly was hee welcommed among the Ladies, and diuerſe familiar ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches paſſed betweene them: till the King being ſet to meate, ſent for <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Galaor</hi> to beare him company, as alſo <hi>Agraies</hi> and his vnckle <hi>Galuanes.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the beginning of this book it hath been declared, how the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine bountie calling <hi>Liſuart</hi> to the Realme of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> ſoone after of a diſinherited Prince, made him the peaceable King of ſuch a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, by the death of his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Falaugris,</hi> who dyed without any heire of his body begotten. Likewiſe how he was reputed ſuch a great Lord through the world, as many Knights came from ſtrange Countries to ſerue him, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues happy, except they might bee named Knights of his Court. But within a while after, whether this fortunate king forgot the author of his good, or elſe it happened by diuine permiſſion: this happy Realme fell into perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and the illuſtrous ſtate of King <hi>Liſuart</hi> was troubled and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, that all men might know: how he onely is Lord and King of all liuing creatures, who exalteth and abaſeth when him pleaſeth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you ſhall here vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. For King <hi>Liſuart</hi> hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, to hold the moſt royal and ſtately Court, that euer king did in the Realme of great <hi>Brittayne,</hi> commanded that on the 5. day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, all the Lords of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould appeare perſonally at
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7179:97"/>
                     <hi>London,</hi> there to determine on matters of chiualrie, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to maintaine with all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour might be deuiſed. But in the ſelfe ſame place, where he thought the greater part of the world ſhould yelde him obeyſance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the firſt mutabilities of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, bringing his eſtate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in danger of vtter ruine, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as you ſhall vnderſtand at large.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Liſuart</hi> departing with all his traine from <hi>Windſore,</hi> to keepe his Court at the famous Cittie of <hi>London,</hi> it was wonderfull to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the Lords, Ladies, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen that gaue their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, eſpecially ſo many young Gentlewomen beeing there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: ſome to regard the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeuce of the Court, other to do ſeruice to their louely miſtreſſes, and nothing now generally min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but paſtime and pleaſure. The King likewiſt (for greater maieſtie of his Court) ordained that none of this aſſembly ſhould lodge in the Cittie, but to erect their Pauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in the fields and meddowes, along the banckes that hemmed in the faire riuer of Thames, leaſt the extreame heate might be hurtfull to them: all which being done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to appointment, the fields ſeemed as a moſt royall Camp, or as if the greater part of the world were there aſſembled. But becauſe the king arriued there two or three daies before the feaſt, he went to his Pallace, accompanied onely with his Queene, <hi>Amadis, Galaor, Agraies, Don Galuanes,</hi> and certaine other his moſt fauoured: the reſt kept themſelues in their tents, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the herbingers had in quarters limited them. With ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſorts of paſtimes was the King entertained, which continued till fortune (enuying his felicitie) changed them into griefe &amp; tears: by the meanes of a Lord, no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the King, but his neerer neighbour then friend, named <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinan,</hi> a man opulent in riches, and endued with few vertues, as may be gathered by the matter enſuing.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Barſinan</hi> was Lord of a Countrey, called <hi>Sanſuegua,</hi> and very familiar with <hi>Arcalans</hi> the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter, who not long before came to him, and conferred with him in this manner. My Lord, quoth hee, the great deſire I haue to doe you ſeruice, hath made me inuent the meane (if you like thereof) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer in ſhort time the Realme of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> quietly into your hands, without much hazarding your perſon, or any great expence. When <hi>Barſinan</hi> (who was a very ambitious man) heard the wordes of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> who promiſed to make him King if he would: he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. In good faith, my deere friend <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> if thou canſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the thing thou vaunteſt of, no feare ſhall hinder me to hazard my perſon, much leſſe will I reckon of expence, if I ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny likely-hood in the compaſſing. It is a thing, ſaide <hi>Arealaus,</hi> very eaſie to bee done, and preſently ſhall you vnderſtand by what meanes: prouided, that you ſweare to me, after you are ſeated in the regiment, to make me ſuper-inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and cheefe maiſter of your houſe-holde. That will I, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Barſiinan,</hi> with any thing elſe thou ſhalt deſire. Marke then the platforme, quoth <hi>Arcalaus.</hi> You know how King <hi>Liſnart</hi> hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly publiſhed, this feaſt of ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember to holde open Court, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you muſt goe well accompai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with knights, then ſhall I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the matter in ſuch ſort, that I
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7179:97"/>
will carry away the King priſoner, no man aliue being able to ſuccour him: in like manner will I carry thence his Daughter, whom you ſhall take to wife, and afterward will I ſend ye the Kings head. Thus in reſpect the Princeſſe is right heire to the Crowne, and you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying her in Mariage, being well accompanied with Knights as I tolde ye: eaſily may you make ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure on the Realme, nor ſhall you finde any to ſpeake againſt it. In ſooth, anſwered <hi>Barſinan,</hi> if ſuch an enterpriſe might ſort to effect, I would make thee more rich and mighty then euer were any of thy linage, as alſo the chiefe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mander my houſe. It ſufficeth ſaid <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> your ſelfe ſhall ſoone perceiue that ſeldom I enterprize any thing but it comes to paſſe: then faile not to bee preſent in the aſſembly at <hi>London.</hi> So came the traytour <hi>Barſinan</hi> to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> ſeighning his intent to do him honor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King ſent many of his knights, entertaining him as a moſt noble friend, appointing his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all things elſe neceſſary for him, and being with the King in his pallace, he entred into theſe ſpeeches. My Lord, vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what royall magnificence you meane to keepe in your Court, as alſo the good Knights and braue men were here to be ſeene, this day I intended to honour you with my perſon: not as your vaſſaile or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, holding my Countrey of God and by the Sword, but as your good neighbour and friend, if you pleaſe. Truſt me, quoth the King, you do me very great pleaſure and honour, and I thanke you for this gentle paines, that you would bee ſeene in ſo good company: aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you Lord <hi>Barſinan</hi> and my friend, this courteſie ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in what I may, for I make very eſpeciall account of you. Your Maieſty dealeth very kindely with me, replied <hi>Barſinan,</hi> and I proteſt on my faith, to bee ready in councelling your affaires for the beſt, according as I haue a long time deſired. See how the traytor lied in euery word, but the good king miſdoubting nothing, requited his offer with many thankes, and to do him the greater honour, appointed his lodging in his owne Palace, himſelfe and his Queene going forth of the Citty with their Tents and Pauilions, immagining he could not do too much for the traitour. And firſt he acquainted him with the whole enterprize, and wherefore he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this great aſſembly, declaring the names &amp; Sir names of the beſt commended Knights, their haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty proweſſe and reſolutions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom hee forgot not <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and <hi>Galaor,</hi> whoſe hardines was impoſſible to be equalled, they two being accompliſhed with all the vertues required in Chiualrie. When the king was withdrawn to his Tents, and <hi>Barſinan</hi> to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, he began to conſider on the ſtrength of his Maieſty, as alſo the loue and obeyſance ſo many great Princes ſhewed him: which made him vnable to enioy and reſt, and often times he repented his fooliſh enterprize, ſeeing how hard is would proue in execution.</p>
                  <p>Now he minded to alter his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, when ſodainely ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion entred his braine, ſo that wauering vp and downe in his thoughts, he could not reſolue one any certainety. On the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he came to the King, who was now clothed in his royall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe it was the firſt day of open Court: and he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7179:98"/>
one to goe to the Queene, willing her to ſend him the Crown he had of the Knight, and ſhee to clothe her ſelfe in the ſumptuous mantle. Hereupon ſhe preſently ſent for the Cofer, and opening it, found nothing therein, whereat ſhe was greatly amazed, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſhee truſted no body with the key thereof, but her owne ſelfe, and euermore carried it about her. But knowing not how to remedie this miſhap, ſhee acquainted the King therewith, who in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure came to her, ſaying. I meruaile Madam you haue kept ſo badly, the Iewel which would haue ſo greatly honoured this time, conſidering vnder what condition it was left with vs. On my faith my Lord, quoth ſhe, I know not what to ſay, I found the Cofer faſt lockt, and none but my ſelfe hath kept the key of it. But in a dreame this laſt night, me thought a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell willed mee to ſhew it her, which I did: afterward ſhe deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the key, and I gaue it her, when opening the Coffer, ſhee tooke forth the Mantle and the Crowne, locking it againe, and laying the key where I tooke it. This done, ſhe put the Mantle about her, and the Crowne on her head, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming her ſo well, as I receiued great pleaſure in beholding her, and thus ſhe ſpake. That her ſelfe, or ſhe from whom ſhe came, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fiue dayes, ſhould rule in the Countrie of a mighty King, who at this time laboured to defend it, and to conquer it from other. Hereupon I demanded what ſhee was, and ſhe anſwered: You ſhall know at the time I haue ſpoken of. So ſhe vaniſhed from me with the Crowne and the Mantle: but on my faith I know not if this viſion came to me ſleeping, or whether it be of truth. The King was now in greater meruaile then before, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her to diſſemble the matter, and not to reueale it to any body: then taking her by the hand, they left the chamber, comming among the knights and Ladies in the place appointed for the ceremonies of the Day, where ſitting down in the 2. chayres of ſtate, the King called his Knights about him, and the Queene her Ladies, with whom ſhe communed. Now had his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty giuen order, that neereſt his perſon ſhould be <hi>Amadis, Galaor, Agraies</hi> and <hi>Don Galuanes,</hi> and at his back King <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Norwales,</hi> well armed, holding his Sword ready drawne, and two hundred Knights for his guard, then by a Herald hee commanded ſilence. But as the King began to ſpeake, there entred a moſt beautifull La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vere richly attired, and with her twelue other Damoſells in like brauery: for in thoſe dayes, the great Lords and Ladies were wont to bring their people to ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, clothed according to their owne perſons, without any difference at all betweene them: this fayre Lady adreſſed her ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the King, deliuering them in forme following. My Lord, moſt humbly I beſeech you to grant me audience, and giue mee reaſon in a matter of difference, which I haue againſt the Knight that ſtandeth by your Maieſty, meaning <hi>Amadis.</hi> Longtime haue I beene requeſted by <hi>Angriot d'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrauaus</hi> to be his wife, who I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured is in this royall preſence: hereto ſhe added how euery thing happened, the cauſe why hee kept the vale of the Pines, and how <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> trauailing that way, made him perforce to abandon Armes. Neuer theleſſe, quoth ſhe, they
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7179:98"/>
departed friends, and <hi>Amadis</hi> ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely promiſed <hi>Angriote,</hi> that he ſhould enioy me as his Wife: wherof when I attained knowledg, I withdrew my ſelfe to a Caſtle of mine, where I kept ſuch a ſtrong guarde and cuſtome, as it was thought impoſſible for any ſtrange knight to enter there, without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: but that knight comming thither, vanquiſhed my guardants, and hath vtterly aboliſhed the drift I intended. Yet afterward of his owne good will he promiſed mee, to cauſe <hi>Amadis</hi> recall his offer to <hi>Angriote:</hi> then chanced an vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py combat betweene him and this knight mine Vnckle, who being at the lateſt extremitie of his life, at my requeſt he was ſpared, on this condition: that on the firſt day your Maieſty held open Court, I ſhould here preſent my ſelfe, to grant a requeſt he muſt demand of me. To ſatisfie my promiſe I am come hither, and deſire to know what he will command me: At which words <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtepped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſaying. My Lord, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath told ye nothing but truth, concerning the ſeuerall promiſes at the Combats: therefore am I ready here to accompliſh, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> ſhall call back his word to <hi>Angriote,</hi> prouided, ſhe performe her owne promiſe. On my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, quoth ſhee, if you effect what you haue ſaid, you pleaſure me more then you can imagine: and to let you know I am ready to fulfill my offer, demand what you pleaſe, for if it be in my power you ſhall preuaile. I requeſt nothing elſe anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> but that you would accept <hi>Angriote</hi> as your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, he louing you ſo deerely as he doth. Out alas, cryed the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, what maner of demand is this? I wiſh Madame ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> that you would marry with ſuch a one, as is well worthy to haue ſo faire a Lady. In ſooth knight, quoth ſhee, this is not according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you made me. I promiſed nothing replied <hi>Amadis</hi> but I will performe it: for if I ſtand bound to you, to cauſe <hi>Amadis</hi> diſcharge his word to <hi>Angriote,</hi> herein I accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it. I am <hi>Amadis,</hi> and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the promiſe I made him, wherein you muſt needes confeſſe your ſelfe ſatisfyed: hee gladly would enioy you as his Wife, and I ioyne with him in the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, thus ſtand I free diſcharged to you both. May it be poſſible? quoth ſhe, that you are the man ſo highly renouned? Credit me Lady, anſwered the King, this is <hi>Amadis.</hi> Ah wretch that I am, ſaid ſhe, now do I wel perceiue, that art nor cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can preuent what God hath appointed, for I haue done my vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt to eſcape <hi>Angriote,</hi> not onely for the euill I wiſh him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining his good and vertuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts: but carying this reſolution, that keeping my ſelfe chaſt and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, I would not bring my liberty into ſubiection: and now when I thought to be furtheſt from him, I am come neerer then euer I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                  <p>Lady, quoth the King, you haue great occaſion to reioyce, for you being faire and rich, he is a yong and braue diſpoſed knight; as you are rich in goods and poſſeſſions, euen ſo is he in bounty and vertue, not onely in deedes of Armes, but in all other good qualities beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a knight, therefore your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage together is very requiſite, and I thinke all in this preſence are of mine opinion: heereupon, ſhee ſtepped to the Queene, ſaying. Madam, you are eſteemed one of the moſt vertuous Princeſſes in the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7179:99"/>
world, moſt humbly I deſire your councell what I ſhall do.</p>
                  <p>Faire friend, anſwered the Queene, according to the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Angriote</hi> had gotten among the good, he well deſerueth, not onely to bee aboundant in riches, but to bee loued of any Lady he ſhall chuſe.</p>
                  <p>Why Lady? ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> think you not that by accident or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, my promiſe was made to <hi>Angriote,</hi> for had he compelled me to one of theſe twaine, then might you well haue condemned mee of folly: but making tryall of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and hardineſſe, yea, to mine owne coſt I dare aſſure ye, and knowing likewiſe his earneſt loue to you: me thinkes the iuſtice of the cauſe commands, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my ſelfe, but all ſuch as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, ought to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in ſeeking remedy for you both: in him, the extreame paſſions hee endureth through your loue, in you, by making his reſtleſſe griefes known to you.</p>
                  <p>Now truſt me Sir, quoth ſhee, ſuch prayſe haue I heard of your v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to euery one, as I imagine you would not ſay (before ſuch an aſſembly) otherwiſe then truth, wherefore following your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, as alſo the pleaſure of the King and Queene, I will forget my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtubborne opinion, and am ready to accompliſh what you ſhall command mee. Then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> taking her by the hand, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Angriote,</hi> and preſenting him his loue, ſaid: Sir <hi>Angriote,</hi> I promiſed to do my vttermoſt in this matter, ſay now, is this the Lady you would haue? Euen ſhe quoth <hi>Angriote,</hi> is the life and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of my Soule, and I am deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to none but her. Then here I giue her you, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> on this condition, that you ſhall be forth with married together, and continue in honourable loue to her as ſhe deſerueth.</p>
                  <p>I thanke you my Lord, quoth he with all my heart, and will obſerue your gentle commandement. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the King called for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of <hi>Salerne,</hi> who conducted them to the Church, where they were eſpouſed in the preſence of many great Lords. Afterward they returned to the Citty, and there the wedding was ſolemnized with great ioy and Triumphs: wherefore wee may well ſay, that hot men, but God appoynteth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, who perceiued the honeſt and continent loue, which <hi>Angriote</hi> euer-more bare to this ſelfe-willed Lady.

                     <p>How King <hi>Liſuart</hi> would haue the aduiſe of his Princes and Lords, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his former determination, for the high exalting and entertayning of Chiualrie.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the end of this mariage, which by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity of opinions cauſed much talke, as commonly it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in ſuch caſes: the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſilence againe by his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld, when euery one being atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to heare what he would ſay, he thus began. My friends, no one of you is ignorant of the heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour toward me, by appointing me the greateſt earthly Lord, that liueth this day in the Iſles of the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean:</hi> Wherefore I thinke it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that as wee in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey are the chiefe, ſo ſhould we be ſecond to no other Prince, in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring immortall thankes by good and vertuous workes, whereof we are now minded to determine. In this reſpect I intreate &amp; command albeit Kings are the heads of their Monarchies, &amp; you the members, that you would altogether take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, and giue mee counſell euen from your conſciences, what you thinke moſt expedient for mee to do, as well for the benefit of my Subiects, as alſo for our eſtate. And I aſſure ye, I am minded to beleeue your opinions, as proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loyall and ſaithfull ſubiects: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore againe I deſire ye, that with-out feare, each one would in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and generally aduiſe, what we ought to doe as matter moſt commendable. Herewith he held his peace, and <hi>Barſinan</hi> Lord of <hi>Sanſuegua</hi> was intreated by all the aſſiſtants to ſpeake his opinion, which they did for no other reaſon but becauſe the King would haue euery one honour him: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after many excuſes on his own behalfe, he aroſe from his ſeate, &amp; making humble reuorence, thus ſpake: ſeeing it liketh you, I ſhould firſt declare my cenſure, I deſire the King and this company to pardon my ignorance, being vnworthy of this honorable and gracious fauor. But me thinks (vnder ſubmiſſion to his pleaſure, and better aduiſe of al you my Lords) that wee ſhould with-draw our ſelues a while from the preſence of his Maieſty, where we may more freely conceiue our ſeuerall humors. This anſwer was generally well liked wherefore the King and Queene left them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, walking into another of their Pauillions: then <hi>Saroloys</hi> the <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Countie of <hi>Clere,</hi> began in this manner. You haue all heard my Lords, the good zeale the King hath to the gouernement, not only of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth in his Realm, but particularly to the honorable encreaſe of Chiualry, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to continue in greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminenco then euer it hath beene. And therefore my Lords humbling my ſelfe to better o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, I thinke it good (to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the intent of our King,) that wee all ought to counſell him, to ſtrengthen himſelfe with men and money: for they are the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of warre and peace, whereby, all Kings on the earth are maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their puiſſant authority. For it is moſt certaine, that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is for Souldiers and men
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7179:100"/>
at armes, by whome Kings reigne, nor ought it for any cauſe to bee elſe-where diſpended, without committing of true ſacrilidge: for theſe affairts are termed holy, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſtate to liue in tranquility, and winne glorious conqueſts of ſuch as ſeeke to inuade them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, to attaine the better thereto, his Maieſtie muſt ſeeke meanes to get all the knigh is he can heare of, as well ſtrangers as other: entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with liberality, to ſend his renowne on winges through the world, which will fetch from the furtheſt parts men to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, in hope of condigne recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to their labour. By their aid he may eaſily make himſelfe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of al the Princes by Eeaſt and Weſt, for it hath neuer beene read or heard, that any Prince could make himſelfe great, except by the aſſiſtance of valiant and hardy Knights, hauing bought their val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotr in breue attempts. I tearme it bought, by fauouring honoring, and diſtributing their treaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: that they may receiue no occaſion of diſlike, but with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable reſolution to purſue victorie. As he would haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in further perſwaſion, the greater part of the Lords ſeemed to allow of his opinion, afferſſing that better conncell could not bee giuen: which when <hi>Barſinan</hi> heard, he requeſted audience for him-ſelfe, and hauing grant thereof, he intended to reuerſe this firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, becauſe he might very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elſe goe forward with his ſecret purpoſe: the ſilence being made, <hi>Barſinan</hi> thus begins. It ſeemeth by your countenance my Lords, that the County of <hi>Clares</hi> opinion is a grounded truth, for I ſee the moſt part of you auerre the ſame, not hauing heard any thing to the contrary: notwithſtanding, I hope to make it knowne to you all, and to the king himſelfe hereafter, how much I deſire to be friend him, you and the whole Realme. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Clare</hi> hath laid before you. that the King your maiſter ought to ſtrengthen himſelfe, by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude &amp; force of ſtrange knights, whom he would haue called from all parts of the world: in ſooth if his opinion were to bee credited, and you your ſelues bound to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, I am certaine in ſhort time their number would be ſuch, as your king, who is a good Prince and liberall: would not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate them with what he was wont to beſtow on you, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe take your owne from you, and giue to them, for naturaly, matter of nouelty and neuer ſeene before, is moſt pleaſing. Hereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that whatſoeuer ſeruice you performe, bee it of neuer ſo high eſteemation, yet ſhall you fall into his diſdaine and oblinion, and ſtrangers life you from the ſeats, which now do promiſe your ſecureſt quiet. Therefore my Lords, before you conclude, this matter is of ſo great importance, as you all ought to bee aduiſed, by good and deſcreete deliberation in your graue iudgements. I hope there is no one in all this aſſembly, that will preſume I ſpeake other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then reaſon and the good loue I beare yee doth admoniſh me, for I thanke God I am ſuch a one, as neede to regard the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Prince my neighbor, no more then he doth me: but conſidering I am in ſo noble compay, and hare here receiued ſuch fauour and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I rather deſire (God is my witneſſe) I had neuer beene borne, then to flatter men with vaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions. You muſt therefore (my
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7179:100"/>
Lords) diligently fore-ſee, leaſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward you repent with too much leyſure. And heere he pauſed, for the murmour was ſo great among them, as they hardly gaue him time to conclude, becauſe the moſt part of them that accorded to the firſt opinion, were now changed and helde with <hi>Barſinan,</hi> by meanes whereof, they could determine nothing, but it was appointed how the king ſhould bee acquainted with this controuerſie, that hee might ſet downe ſome better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and after it had againe beene debated in his preſence, hee thus ſpake vnto them all.</p>
                  <p>My honourable friends, I am ſure that the loue you beare me, &amp; your forward deſire in doing mee ſeruice, hath brought you into theſe intricate difficulties: and I thinke there is no one of you all, but hath ſpoken ſo neere to truth as is poſſible, whereby your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſo ſound and good, as better cannot bee heard from any. Notwithſtanding, it is a thing moſt ſure and certaine, that the Kings of the earth are not eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med great, by the number of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their poſſeſſion, but by the quantity and multitude of their people, ouer whom they rule and command. For what can one king alone do? it may be much leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſimpleſt of his ſubiects: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide, it ſhal ſeem a matter aboue his power, to gouerne &amp; maintain his eſtate without people, let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in neuer ſo much wealth: nor can theſe tranſitorie gifts of fortune be better imployed, then diſtributed among ſuch as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them. Whereby I gather, how euery man of good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will ſay, that good counſell and ſtrength of men, is the very treaſure indeede. If yet you will haue better inſtance hereof, looke on the liues of great <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſtrong <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> gentle <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> and many other, whoſe names beare the title of immortality they by the treaſure of men, and not mony, were made Kings, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours &amp; Monarchs, for they could bountifully diſtribute their coyne, to ſuch as they well knew had beſt deſerued it; and likewiſe would vſe them with gracious behauiour, as they might be termed Lords both in heart and hand, the only meane that made them be ſerued with fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. Therefore my good friends, I deſire you all, euen in the moſt intire affection I can vſe, that you aſſiſt me to your vttermoſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of good Knights, either of our owne or ſtrangers: promiſing you by the faith and word of a king, ſo honorably to entreate and eſteeme of them, as both they and you ſhall remaine contented. Nor are you ignorant my noble friends, that the better we bee accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more we ſhall be feared of our enemies, our ſtate in greater ſafety, and your ſelues more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely defended and loued. If then any vertue at all abide in vs, you may eaſily iudge, how new friends cannot make vs forgetfull of our olde: let none then differ from the requeſt I haue made, but rather yeelde and conſent thereto. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine I entreat ye, and expreſſely command, that each of you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently name ſuch to me as you know, happely they being yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to me: to the end if any be in this Court, they may receiue ſuch fauour of vs, as the abſent may bee the better affected to our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; likewiſe we entreat them, not to depart our company, without giuing vs ſome aduertiſement. All which was preſently done, many

openly called, and their names ſet downe but becauſe the tables were couered for dinner, the King aroſe from his chaire, withdrawing him-ſelfe into the appointed Hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, where many Tables were proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which he commanded to bee well furniſhed with Knights. You may eaſily coniecture, that during the ſeruice, they diuerſly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, ſome on the kings deliberation, and other, of his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, vntill the Tables were with-drawne againe: when the King cauſed them all to be called, and thus ſpake. You ſee my good friends, how earneſtly I loue and deſire your company, wherefore you muſt grant me one requeſt, not to depart this Court without my leaue: for I would particularly know the ſeruice you haue done me, and you taſt ſuch reward of my treaſure, as may continue your loue to me. Hereupon they were ſeuerally called by name againe, and euery one confirmed the kings requeſt, except <hi>Amadis,</hi> becauſe he was the Queenes knight: and al this while was ſhe preſent at theſe matters, wherefore after the noiſe was ſomewhat appeaſed, ſhe fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her ſpeeches to the King in this manner. My Lord, ſeeing it hath pleaſed you ſo to fauour and honour your Knights, me thinks it were reaſonable that I ſhould doe the like to the Ladies and Gentle-women, of what part ſoeuer they be. Wherefore I humbly deſire one boone, with aſſurance like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if you conſent, theſe Gentle-men after you ſhall not deny mee: conſidering that in ſemblable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, good things deſerue to bee demanded and granted. Then the King looked on all the aſſiſtants, ſaying: What anſwer (my friends) ſhall we make the Queene? ſhall we agree to her demand? Yea Sir, if it be your pleaſure, anſwered they. What? ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> were it poſſible to deny a princeſſe ſo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous? Seeing you are all ſo well content, quoth the King, ſhe ſhall obtaine whatſoeuer ſhe asketh. At theſe words the Queene aroſe, and thanking her Lord, ſaid. Seeing it pleaſeth you to giue place and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to my requeſt, I deſire hence-forth you would doe ſuch honour to Ladies and Gentlewomen, as to take them into your protection and defence: maintayning their quarrells againſt all ſuch as would moleſt them any manner of way. Beſide, if you haue made promiſe of ſome ſuite to a man, and the like to any Lady or Gentlewoman: you firſt ſhall accompliſh the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans requeſt, as being the weakeſt perſon, and who hath moſt neede to be holpen. This granted, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after they ſhall be better fauoured and defended then euer they were: for villaynes that are wont to do them iniurie, meeting them in the fields, and knowing they haue ſuch knights as you are for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectours, dare no way wrong them. In ſooth Madame, ſaid the King, your requeſt is reaſonable, and I thinke none will gaine-ſay it: wee will haue it therefore regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred and ſet downe as a law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Eane while this hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company thus continued, free from all danger and miſ-hap, thinking on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but pleaſure and delights: there entred a Damoſell clad in mourning, who falling on her knees before the King, thus ſpake. My Lord, ech one is merry but my poore ſelfe, who am ſo croſſed with griefe and ſorrow, as death were the beſt friend could come to me: yet would your Maieſtie take compaſſion on me, I eaſily might recouer my ioy againe. Theſe wordes were dipt in ſuch aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of teares, as the King being moued therewith to pittie, thus anſwered. Lady, I would be very glad to relieue your ſadneſſe, but tell me who is the cauſe thereof? Dread Lord, quoth ſhe, my Father and Vncle are detained priſoners, by a Lady who hath vowed neuer to releaſe them vntill they deliuer her two ſo good knights as one was whom they killed in fight. On what occaſion did they kill him? ſaid the King. Becauſe he vanted, replied the Damoſel, that he alone would combat with them, and ſo proud he grew in ſpeeches, as at length he defied them. Not long after they meeting one day toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the knight vſed ſuch reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing tearmes of cowardiſe, as my Father and vncle could not indure the iniurie: but falling to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, the knight was ſlaine in the preſence of a Lady, named <hi>Galden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> who, as ſhe ſaid, procured his comming to maintain a difference, which ſhe had with a neighbour of hers, being her great enemy: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing him dead, ſhe cauſed the conquerors to be taken, &amp; put them into the moſt miſerable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world: albeit my father, and vncle often told her, that they would performe for her what the knight ſhould haue done. But ſhe anſwered, how ſhee well knew they were not ſufficient for the cauſe, &amp; therefore ſhould neuer be relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, vntill they deliuered her two knights of like account, each of them valuing him in ſtrength who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had ſlaine, to finiſh the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt himſelfe was able to doe. Know you not Damoſell, ſaid the King, againſt whom they ſhoulde combat, or the place where it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed? No truely Sir, anſwered the Damoſell, but I haue ſeene my father and vncle eruelly put in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where their friends ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> compas no meanes to ſee them. Herewith ſhe began again to weep, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one pittied to behold her, which made the king aske her, if the place were far off: In fiue daies my Lord, quoth ſhe, it may eaſily be gone &amp; returned. Now truſt me, ſaid the king, you ſhall not want your ioy for two knights, wherefore looke among al theſe gallants, and chuſe ſuch as you beſt fancy.

and falling at the Queenes feete, proceeded thus. Madame, you are ſayde to bee one of the wiſeſt and moſt vertuous dames in the world, you vnderſtand the cauſe of my mourning, and the gracious offer the King hath made me: moſt humbly I beſeech ye the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of God, to take co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion on a poore Gentlewoman, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell me which two knights I ſhall chuſe, that are beſt able to ſupport my want. Beleeue me Damoſell, anſwered the Queen, you demand a matter of great importance, yet in ſuch ſort doe I pittie your cauſe, as I am the more willing to giue you aduiſe: albeit I would be loth to forgoe them twaine, whome I could name in this company. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhee ſhewed her <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſaying: This is my knight. And pointing to <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſayde. This other is the Kings, yet be they both bretheren, and the beſt Knights (as I haue heard) this day liuing. I deſire your Maieſtie, quoth the Damoſell, to tell me their names. The one, ſayd the Queene, is called <hi>Amadis,</hi> and the other <hi>Galaor.</hi> But by your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, replied the Damoſell, is this <hi>Amadis,</hi> the knight ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed? I am very certaine, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, ſo ſoone as hee and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall arriue where I can bring them, my cauſe will be ſufficiently executed, therefore I deſire you to obtaine mee their company. Hereupon the Queen called them, ſaying: I beſeech yee both to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour this woman, who ſtandeth in neede of your aſſiſtance. <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſomewhat flow in anſwering, for he caſt his eye on the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> to note if ſhe would like of his departure: and ſhe who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe pittied the womans cauſe, let fall her gloues, which was an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſignall betweene them, and thereby he was certified of her conſent, wherefore hee thus ſpake to the Queene. I am at your diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, Madame, to do whatſoeuer you ſhall command me. Go then, in Gods name, quoth ſhe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne again with all poſſible ſpeed, without tarying for any thing that may happen. Hereto they willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condeſcended, and taking leaue of her, <hi>Amadis</hi> fained hee would ſpeake to <hi>Mabila,</hi> when comming neure her and <hi>Oriana,</hi> hee ſayde to his Goddeſſe. Madame, well may I ſay that the faireſt Lady in the world, ſends mee to ſuccour the moſt wofull woman I euer did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde. Sweete friend, quoth <hi>Oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> I repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that I gaue you ſo much libertie, becauſe my minde telleth me, this attempt will proue ſome-what dangerous to you, which I hope the heauens will powerfully defend. I am perſwaded Madame, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> that as the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull worke-man of the world, hath enriched you with beauty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other women, he will nor ſuffer you to feele diſpleaſure, by any miſ-fortune happening to mee: for being yours as I am, I imagine my ſelfe ſo happy, as I thinke no euill can chance to mee, if I continue in your gracious fauour. If it lay in my power, replied <hi>Oriana,</hi> I would reuoke your licence of depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but ſeeing it may not bee, I will remaine in prayer for your proſperous ſucceſſe. So taking leaue of her, hee and <hi>Galaor</hi> went to arme them-ſelue, then doing their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty to the king, they rode away in company of the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. As thus they trauailed, about mid-day they entred the forrreſt, which commonly was called the <hi>vnfortunate Ferreſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7179:102"/>
neuer any knight errant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into it, that could eſcape with-out ſome michiefe: and ſo theſe two bretheren deerely experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for ſuch miſhap befell them, as they verily thought to loſe their liues. Still rode they on without any aduenture, till the Mo one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to grace the euening, yet would not the Damoſell ſhew any ſigne of ſtay, which made <hi>Amadis</hi> aske this queſtion: Gentlewoman, ſhall we reſt out ſelues here a while? Yea mary, quoth ſhee, here before wee ſhall finde tents ready prouided, and people in them who expect your comming: make then a little haſt I pray you, becauſe I will goe before to aduertiſe them. They were very well content therewith, and ſo the Damoſell left them, till ſoone after they eſpied the tents, where they ſaw her among other Ladyes and knights, who bad the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welcome at their arriuall: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alighted from their horſes, they were conducted into a Pauillion, hauing ſeruants ſtanding ready to take their armour, which they had no ſooner put off, but was caryed by them into another roome, where-upon <hi>Amadis</hi> demanded why they did ſo. Becauſe, replied the Damoſell, you muſt lodge where they haue caryed your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. He imagining ſhee ſayde true, made no further enquirie, but ſate downe with his brother on ſtooles that ſtood ready for them, attending the houre of ſupper. Not long had they ſitten there, but fiue knights well armed entred fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly vpon them, ſaying: Yeelde your ſelues, elſe you are ſlaine. When <hi>Amadis</hi> heard and ſaw their bad behauiour, he knew right well they were betraied, and ſtarting vp, ſaide to <hi>Galaor.</hi> By God bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wee are treacherouſly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Then finding no remedy but preſent death, after they had ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the knights, who eaſily might haue taken their liues, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> thus ſpake. Ah villaines, you haue vs now at too much aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, deliuer vs our armes, and this quarrell ſhalbe otherwiſe decided. Theſe wordes will little profit yee, anſwered the Knights, yeeld your ſelues our priſoners, or we will kill ye. So may you doe, ſayd <hi>Galaor,</hi> like traitours as you are, and I will maintaine my wordes againſt two or three of you, if you dare deliuer me mine armes. We need no ſuch proofe, replied the knights, but if you contend in further ſpeeches, you ſhall deerely buy them with the loſſe of your liues. Now truſt me, quoth <hi>Amades,</hi> wee rather will dye, then be priſoners to ſuch vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines as you are.

the Lady, but would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell ye to yeeld your ſelues to mee. Whereto at length they accorded, ſeeing they could no way elſe ſaue their liues: yet knew ſhe not their names, for the Damoſell that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them thither, would not tell her, becauſe if her Miſtreſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what they were, ſhe knew they might not eſcape the death. Wherefore ſhee was content to conceale them, in reſpect of the offence ſhe ſhould commit, by cauſing the death of two ſo good knights: beſide, ſhee repented her vnhonorable iourney, which now ſhe could no way remedie, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by keping their names vnknown.

Madame, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> if you do this, thinking thereby to offend king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> you much abuſe your ſelfe: for we are two poore knights, who haue no other riches then our Armour and Horſe, and hee hath ſuch ſtore of redoubted Seruants, as he will little care whether you impriſon vs or no: yet ſhall it bee ſuch a ſhame to vs, as you can ne-uer imagine the like, becauſe wee are vnable to do it. What? quoth ſhe, loue you better to ſpend your life time in a moſt miſerable priſon then to forſake the ſeruice of the moſt diſloyall king liuing? Now truſt me Madame, anſwered <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> but ill beſeems you theſe bad ſpeeches: for he is one of the beſt Princes in the World, and againſt any knight I will maintaine, that neuer was diſloyalty found in him. In luckleſſe time for thee, ſaid <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſima,</hi> haſt thou vttered thy loue: wherewith ſhee commanded their hands to be bound. That ſhall I do, replied a knight, and cut off their heads, if you pleaſe. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he laid hold on <hi>Amadis,</hi> who was ſo offended thereat, as he lifted his fiſt to giue him a blow on the care: but the knight eſcaping, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> caught him about the middle, throwing him ſo violently againſt the ground, that he thought his heart was broken, for he lay ſtill and moued not. Now grew the Lady and her knights into ſuch anger with <hi>Amadis,</hi> as preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would haue ſlaine him, and he had not eſcaped, but that an ancient knight ſtepped before him with his Sword drawne, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch threatnings and other behauiour, as he cauſed them all to goe forth of the Pauillion: yet could he not defend him ſo well, but <hi>Amadis</hi> was wounded on the right ſhoulder. Then ſtepped the auncient knight to <hi>Madaſima,</hi> with theſe wordes. By God Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame you deale like a very vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Woman, cauſing your

Madame, replied <hi>Galaor,</hi> we rather chuſe to die, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but your ſelfe ſhall binde vs: for you by nature are gentle and courteous, and we as priſoners wil ſhew obeyſance to you. Seeing you ſay ſo, anſwered <hi>Madaſima,</hi> I will binde you my ſelfe: hereupon ſhe bound their hands with ſtrong cords, and preſently taking downe the Tents, they departed thence, <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Galaor</hi> being ſet on horſes without Saddles, and led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by two Sergeants: as for <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> and <hi>Galaors</hi> Squire, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed on foot, hauing their hands bound behinde them, in manner as if they had gone to hanging, and thus were they conſtrained to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile al night through the Forreſt.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Amadis</hi> was weary of his life, not ſo much for his hard vſage, in reſpect he could gouerne himſelfe with wonderfull patience: but for the matter <hi>Madaſima</hi> would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them to, the refuſall whereof, gaue hope of no better vſage at her hand, but for euer to be depriued of his faire <hi>Oriana.</hi> And contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if he conſented, he ſhould in like manner be baniſhed from her preſence, being compelled to ſerue king <hi>Liſuart</hi> no longer: theſe two extremitys troubled his thoughts, which the ancient knight well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that ſaued their liues, yet he imagined the cauſe to proceede from his hurt, and was moued to pitty him, for the Damoſell had told him, that he was one of the beſt knights in the world.</p>

But what you doe, do quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe at that place whither we are now going, ſhe intends to ſend one of her ſeruants to King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, whoſe errand is onely to enquire your names: for ſhe that conducted you hither, (perceiuing you ſhould aſſuredly die, if her miſtreſſe knew the names of you both) diſguiſed the matter ſo with her, as ſhe ſaid, ſhe forgot to aske your names: onely thus perſwading her, that you were two of the very beſt Knights in the World.

                  <p>Madame, you carry two priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with you, but you doe not know what they are.

No Madame, anſwered the Knight, I ſpeake of him which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth next vs, whoſe youth and beauty had you well regarded, your ſelfe would ſay you haue been too outragious in iniurie. What though he be your priſoner, it is not for any offence committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, but onely through the hatred you beare to another: all which you may yet redreſſe in much better ſort then you began, conſidering if he conceiued liking of you, you may thereby eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to loue, and vnder that ceremony, draw him to do what your ſelfe ſhall deſire.

                  <p>Here you muſt note, that the Knight no ſooner left <hi>Galaor</hi> when he went to the Ladie, but he tooke occaſion thus to talke with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

I maruell my Lord, that in a time of ſuch honor, you weare not the Crowne I left with you.

                     </gap>yet to proue it, or how it will become ye? When the King heard his words, knowing they were loſt, he ſate a good while without any anſwere, which made the knight thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin againe. On my faith I am glad you like the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, for had you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to keepe them, you muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe haue granted my demand, and happely it would proue greater then you expect: otherwiſe, in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying your promiſe, you might procure the loſſe of my head. Moſt humbly therefore I beſeech ye my Lord, to will them be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me againe, becauſe I may tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry no longer here.</p>
                  <p>At which words the King ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med much offended, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able any longer time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale his hidden anger; earneſtly fixing his eyes vpon him (which were then ouer clouded with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented brow) he brake forth into theſe following ſpeeches, Know knight, that whatſoeuer promiſes, I haue made to thee, are (like thoſe decrees, which ſtand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in the booke of Fate) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, and thou ſhalt finde that I will keepe them inuiolable: Although I muſt confeſſe, (for the which I am heartily ſorry; not ſo much for my ſelfe; who am a partner with thee in the loſſe: as for thy ſake who committed them to my truſt) that both the Crowne and Mantle are vtterly loſt, how, or by what meanes I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, would heauens would pleaſe to be ſo propitious as to bring to light this deede of darkeneſſe; then ſhould my now troubled heart, finde comfort, and you, your wiſhed deſire: Which till then cannot reſt contented, my much perplexed minde would then bee at peace, which now is at ciuill Warres, and inteſtine contention within me. At which words, not being able any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his tongue (the hearts beſt interpreter both for ioy and griefe) to expreſſe himſelfe, he abruptly pauſed, partlie moued thereunto by the knight who gaue a loud ſhrike, ſaying.</p>
                  <p>Ah wretched and miſerable old man, now comes the time I ſo much feared, bringing with it, my lateſt and vnluckie exigent: haue I not long enough endured torments, but now muſt after all thoſe miſeries, finiſh mine olde age in the moſt ſore, cruell death

was euer heard of, hauing by no offence deſerued it? While thus he complained, the teares aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly trickled downe his white beard, which moued the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to pitty his griefe, and the King himſelf ouercom with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, returned this anſwere. Feare not (Knight) to ſpeede any thing the worſe for my loſſe, you muſt be ſatisfied whatſoeuer it coſt me, according as I faithfuly promiſed. At theſe words the Knight would haue kiſſed his feete, but the King reſtrained him, ſaying: Demand what thou wilt, for thou ſhalt haue it. I know my Lord, quoth the Knight, you remember your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to deliuer my Crowne and Mantle, or whatſoeuer I requeſted for them: God is my witneſſe, I intended not to deſire what now I muſt needes, by reaſon I haue no other meane whereby to bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, if I had, I would acquit you of the griefe I know you will endure, granting me the thing I muſt of neceſſitie demand: but now it may not be otherwiſe, except you infringe your faith &amp; loyaltie. Rather will I loſe my Kingdome, replied the King, then make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe and not fulfill it, ſay bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore thy minde. I thanke your Maieſty, quoth the knight, there now remaineth nothing, but to haue aſſurance from the Lords of your Court, that they ſeeke not to take from me the gift you muſt deliuer: otherwiſe your promiſe cannot be perform'd, or I ſatisfied, hauing a reward now, and taken from me anon. Great reaſon, ſaid the King, my word ſhall ſtand for their warrant. Seeing my Lord, quoth the knight, Fortune hath ſo permitted, that you haue loſt my Mantle and the Crowne, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſaue my head, except you giue me Madame <hi>Oriana</hi> your Daughte. Be therefore now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, either reſtore my Iewells, or giue me her, albeit I loue the one better then the other: for neuer can I haue ſo much good by her, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

The proofe is ready, if Subiects finde not their Prince faithfull, and his word inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable, what care will they haue of the loue and fidelitie they owe to him? much better vnborne then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch blemiſh: this knight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt haue my daughter, and I will deliuer her according to my promiſe. Hereupon he ſent for her but the Queene being preſent all this while, little thought the king would ſo forget his fatherlie loue: and when ſhe heard this rigorous ſentence pronounced againſt her Daughter, ſhee good Lady fell at the kings feete, when wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping (as a Mother for the loſſe of her Childe) ſhe ſaid. What will ye doe my My Lord? will ye bee more inhumane to your owne blood, then the bruite Beaſts are to their contraries? Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their brutiſh qualities, yet be they neuer ſo vnnatural to ſhew any violence to their young ones. May it then be thought reaſonable vnder ſhaddow of an accorded promiſe (without knowledg there-of) to commit ſo great wrong, not

onely againſt your ſelfe impitious father, or mee a woefull and vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate mother, but likewiſe againſt the whole common weale of this Realme? Alas Sir, let my inceſſant teares perſwade you, to bethinke ſome other meane for your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and alſo to content the knight. Madame, quoth the King, my word is paſt, I pray you talke no more thereof to me. Thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the teares ſtreamed downe his cheekes, whereat the Lords were not a little agrieued, and that which moſt troubled him, was the acclamations of the Ladies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King commanded them to their chambers. The Queene ſeeing ſhe might not preuaile, fell in a ſwoune, but by her Ladies ſhe was conueighed thence, the King giuing charge on paine of death, that no one ſhould ſeeke to alter his promiſe. My daughter, quoth hee, I commit to the pleaſure of God, but my promiſe ſhall not be broken if I can help it.</p>
                  <p>By this time the newes came to <hi>Oriana,</hi> how her Father had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her departure, whereat ſhee fell downe in ſuch a traunce, as they neuer expected life in her againe: when <hi>Mabila</hi> and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies reputing her dead indeede, thought beſt to acquaint the King therewith, yet by forced remedies ſhee reuiued againe, breathing forth many dolorous ſighes. Now the moſt of the women ſeuered themſelues, ſome neare, and ſome further from her, becauſe ſhee ſhould not heare their complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and ſuch compaſſion tooke they on her, as would haue conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſtony heart into teares, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when the Princeſſe recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the power of ſpeech, and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vttered theſe regreets. Full wel, quoth ſhee, doe I well beholde mine owne ruine. Ah ſweete friend, wert thou heere, eaſily wouldſt thou deliuer me from this paine: but thus much my heart foretolde mee, euen at the very houre of thy departure. Ah cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bee that houre, becauſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it. When thou ſhalt heare of theſe tydings, I feare (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnable to endure them) thou wilt die immediately: yet this is the beſt hope, we ſhall not be long one after another. Ah death, the onely refuge to the vnfortunate, ſeeſt thou not me foremoſt in this ranke? why ſtayeſt thou? Fortune will triumph ouer thee, in dealing ſo extreamely as ſhee can with me, albeit I knowe thou art able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge thy ſelfe: make haſte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and let her not get ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence on mee, in deſpight (as it were) of thy authority. Adiew then ſweete friend, for neuer ſhall wee ſee each other more in this life: at theſe wordes ſhee fell in a ſwoune againe. When the King ſaw ſhee tarryed ſo long, hee ſent to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand her make more ſpeed: but the meſſenger found her in the deadly agony, and ſtaying till ſhe was recouered againe, as ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to renew her moanes, he thus ſpake to her. Madame, the King is offended becauſe you come not to him.</p>
                  <p>When ſhee heard this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, ſhee aroſe, hauing her heare ſo ſealed vp with griefe, as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to enable her vitall forces, and being followed by none of her women, but the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> ſhee came before the King, and caſting her ſelfe at his feete, ſayde. My Lord and Father, what is your pleaſure with mee? Faire Daughter, quoth her, I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh my promiſe.

when the King grieuing to behold the ſight therof, turned his head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſaying to the knight. See my friend, here is the gift you demand, and the onely thing in the world I moſt loue: but intend you to carry her hence alone? My Lord, ſayd the knight, ſhe ſhall be accompanied with two Gentlemen and their Squires, which were in my company when you made mee this promiſe at <hi>Windſore:</hi> &amp; more may I not allowe, vntill hee haue her, vnto whom I am conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to deliuer her. Yet let her haue the company of this Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, ſaide the King, for it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely, ſhe ſhould bee alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many men. Well, quoth the knight, for one woman it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not. So taking the Princeſſe in his armes, ſhee being ſcant reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from her ſwoune, he ſet her vp on horſe-backe, &amp; cauſed a Squire to ſit behind her on the horſe, who might hold her faſt leſt ſhe ſhould fall: and a very ſad countenance ſhewed the knight, ſaying, there was none in the Court more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull then himſelfe. After the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> was moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the King intreated her not to leaue his daughter whatſoeuer happened. And while they were thus preparing, the Princeſſe loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king woefully about her: a tall knight well armed came among them, who not taking off his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, or ſaluting the company, tooke <hi>Orianaes</hi> horſe by the bridle. This was <hi>Arcalaus</hi> the enchanter, and came in this ſort leſt he ſhould bee knowen: ſoone after he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Squire to ride away with her, which the Princeſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, and ſeeing there was no other remedy, deliuering a ſigh as if her heart would haue ſplit, ſhee ſayde. Ah my deere friend, in a happleſſe houre for you was the boone granted, becauſe it will bee both your death and mine. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhee meant <hi>Amadis,</hi> whom ſhee gaue leaue to depart with the Damoſell, yet the ſtanders by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it of her father and her ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Thus departed <hi>Oriana</hi> with them that conducted her, who rode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace till they were entred the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt neere at hand: and the King himſelfe was mounted on horſe-backe, to conduct his daughter ſomewhat on the way, as alſo to forbid any rescue from following, according to his former promiſe. But the Princeſſe <hi>Mabila</hi> ſtanding at a windowe, to ſee this ſad and penſiue ſeparation, could come no nearer to <hi>Oriana,</hi> her heart was ſo ſurpriſed with griefe: yet by hap ſhee eſpyed <hi>Dardan</hi> the Dwarffe that ſerued <hi>Amadis,</hi> making ſpeed after the Princeſſe on horſe-backe, when calling him to her, ſhe ſaide. <hi>Dardan,</hi> if thou loue thy Maſter, ſtay not any where till thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with this mishappe: if now thou faile him, it may returne to thine owne daunger, for this is the time of greateſt neceſſity. By God Madame, anſwered the Dwarffe, I will with all diligence performe my duty. So giuing the ſpurres to his horſe, hee galloped the ſame way his Maſter rode with the Damoſell.</p>
                  <p>But leaue wee him poſting, and tell what now happened to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> who accompanied his Daughter to the entrance of the Forreſt, cauſing all ſuch to returne as followed him. Euen in the houre of his trouble, a Damoſell came to him mounted on a ſwift Palfray, with a ſworde hanging about her neck, and a Launce richly painted, hauing the point gilded ouer: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

ſhee had ſaluted him, ſhe thus ſpake. My Lord, God increaſe your ioy, and make you willing to performe what you haue promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me at <hi>Windſore,</hi> in the preſence of all your worthy knights. At theſe wordes the King knew her, remembring it was ſhe that ſayde, how ſhe would prooue the vertue of his heart, whereupon hee thus anſwered. In good faith Damoſel, I haue now more neede of ioy then euer I had: notwithſtanding, I am readie to accompliſh any thing I promiſed you. It is the only thing my Lord, quoth ſhe, of my returne to you, being the moſt loyall King in the world, wherefore humbly I intreate yee, preſently to reuenge my cauſe on a knight that paſſed through this Forreſt, who not long ſince ſlew my father, by the moſt horrible treaſon that euer was heard of: yet not content there-with, the villaine violently tooke mee away, and perforce made me yeeld to his vnlawfull will. But in ſuch ſort is hee enchanted, as hee cannot bee done to death, except the moſt vertuous man in the Realme of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> giue him a wound with this Launce, and another with this ſword: both which he gaue in keeping to a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, of whom hee had good hope to be loued, yet therein he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for ſhee hateth him aboue all others, for which cauſe ſhe gaue mee this ſword and Lance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might both be reuenged on him. Nor can it bee done but by you onely, who are the chiefe and moſt vertuous man in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: wherefore as you promiſed mee before ſo valiant men, may it pleaſe ye to execute this iuſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vengeance. And becauſe I haue often tolde him, that by this day I would bee prouided of a knight to combate with him, he is come alone into this Forreſt, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending onely for my Champion. It is likewiſe ordered; how you muſt haue no company but my ſelfe, for hee little thinketh that I haue the Sworde and Launce ſo hurtfull to him: and this is our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement together, if hee remaine conquerour, I muſt pardon him mine iniury, but if he be vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hee muſt doe what I command him. Preſently the King ſent a Gentleman for his Armour, which when hee had put on, he mounted on a braue Courſer, girding the Damoſels ſworde about him, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his owne that was one of the beſt in the world: then without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other company hee rode on with her, ſhee carrying his helmet. Not farre had they ridden, but ſhe cauſed him to forſake the high beaten way, conducting him by a little path among the ſhrubs, where not long before they had paſt that led away <hi>Oriana:</hi> then the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell ſhewed him a huge knight ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, mounted on a black Courſer, whereupon ſhe ſayde. My Lord, take your helmet, for this is he you muſt deale withall: which the King quickly did, &amp; approaching neare the knight, ſayd. Proud Traytour, defend thy ſelfe, and thy lawleſſe Iuſt. So couching their Launces, they encountred together, where the King perceiued how his pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Launce brake like a ſtalke of hempe, hauing no ſtrength at all in it: which made him drawe his ſword to charge the knight, but at the firſt ſtrok, the blade broke cloſe to the hilt, whereby hee imagined himſelf betraied, for the knight did what he pleaſed to him. But as hee would haue killed his horſe, the King being quick &amp; nimble caught holde by his gorget, and in ſuch

                     </gap>ore they ſtrugled together, as they both fell to the ground, the knight vnderneath, and the King vpon him, by meanes whereof, hee got his ſword from him, and vnlacing his helmet to ſmite off his head, the Damoſell cryed out ſo loude as ſhee could: Sir <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> helpe your Coſen quickely, or elſe hee dies. When the King heard her name <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> hee looked vp, and ſawe ten braue knights come run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto him, the one of them v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe wordes: King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> ſpare the knight, otherwiſe thou ſhalt not reigne one houre. If I die, anſwered the King, ſo ſhall you all for mee, like traytours as you are. Then one of them gaue him ſuch a blowe with his Launce, as not onely ſore hurt him, but made him fall on his face to the ground: yet did hee recouer himſelfe very quickely, like one reſolued to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his life, albeit hee ſawe death preſent before his eyes. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnable to reſiſt ſo many, at length they got ſure holde on him, when renting off his helmet &amp; his ſhield, they bound him faſt with a double chaine. Afterward they ſet him on a ſimple horſe, two knights ſtill holding the ends of the chain, and ſo leading him along, ſought where they might finde <hi>Arcalaus, Oriana,</hi> and the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark:</hi> but the knight againſt whom the King firſt fought, rode before apace, and wauing his gauntlet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft to <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> ſayde, Beholde Coſen, kin <hi>Liſuart</hi> is ours.

By God, ſayde <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> neuer ſhould I make reckoning of my ſelfe, to vanquiſh ſuch a Lord as thou art.</p>
                  <p>Thus contending as they rode, they came to a double way, where <hi>Arcalaus</hi> ſtayed, thus ſpeaking to his Page.

At length they found the tracke of horſes, and by good hap met with certaine poore labouring men, whom they asked if they met not any by the way.

I pray you Sir, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Hermite, knowe you of whence the Ladies be? One of them, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> is the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> daughter and heire to the vertuous king <hi>Liſuart:</hi> the other is a Lady attending on her. The God of heauen, anſwered the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, further your intent, that ſo good a Princeſſe may not be long in ſuch a wretches cuſtody. If you haue any prouender Father, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> I deſire you giue my horſe a little. The Hermit brought forth ſuch as hee hee had, and while the horſe fed, <hi>Amadis</hi> demaunded, to whom the Caſtle belonged.

Alas ſweet friend, quoth ſhe, great reaſon haue you to bid mee adiew, when I would permit you to goe ſuccour her, that ſeemed the moſt wofull woman in the world: for I feare this ſhall bee our laſt conge, and neuer may you ſee me againe, becauſe death giueth ſuch due at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, as it is impoſſible for me to eſcape. Theſe words were of ſuch vertue, that albeit <hi>Amadis</hi> could not refraine from teares, yet did they ſo liuely inflame his heart, as ouer-reaching them ere they knew any thing, hee thus ſpake to them. You lye falſe traitours, for theſe Ladyes ſhall paſſe no further. The voyce of <hi>Amadis</hi> was quickly knowne by <hi>Oriana</hi> and the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> when imagining themſelues already reskewed, their mindes were ioyfully cheered, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to ſee their conductours ſo ſuddenly amated.

Now did he fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue to die, or purchaſe his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for hee was ſo offended to ſee the King bound with chaines, as hee imagined himſelfe able to conquer them all, &amp; as many more if they had been there, whereupon he thus cryed to them: Traytours, durſt you vnreuerently lay hand on the beſt King in the world? With theſe wordes he met one of them ſo directly, as his Launce paſſing through his body, hee fell downe dead beſide his horſe. When the other foure ſaw their companion ſlaine, they willed the for moſt fiue to guard the King, for they would reuenge his death ſufficiently: but they found themſelues very much deceiued, for though the Princes horſe (by reaſon of his ſore trauell) often ſtumbled, and thereby put him in danger of falling, yet laide hee ſuch loade vpon his enemies, as two more of them accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the firſt, and the other twaine were brought into hard extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Then came the other fiue with a freſh charge vpon him, when <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> perceiuing his owne danger, intended to reuenge his death and the Kings together, entring coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly among the thickeſt, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt rare and haughty chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. When the two Coſens that followed him beheld his behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, confounded with maruell, the one ſayd to the other.

Reſolued thus to ſuccour him, they valiantly thruſt themſelues into the skirmiſh, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering ſuch friendly blowes on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſide, that <hi>Galaor</hi> ſoone felt himſelfe well aſſiſted: becauſe his enemies were ſomewhat more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and hee had leaſure to take a little breathing, but wondering whence this aide ſhould proceed, hee fell to worke againe, giuing them good cauſe to miſdoubt their liues. When the Coſen to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus</hi> ſawe how his ſide decayed, and his knights diſhartened, ſlaine and ſore wounded: hee purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to kill the King: who by this time found the meanes to vnbinde himſelfe, and alighting from his horſe, got one of the ſlaine knightes ſwordes, where-with

hee reſiſted his enemies brauely. As the coſin to <hi>Arcalaus</hi> followed his intent, the king gaue his horſe ſuch a blow ouer the face, as by rearing vp, hee fell downe back-ward; yet the Knight recouered himſelfe, and <hi>Galaor</hi> ſeeing one fight with the king, came to aſſiſt him, when ſnatching off his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, hee would haue ſmitten his head from his ſhoulders: but the king would not ſuffer him, ſaying, hee ſhould liue and dye a theefe. The two coſins, who were named <hi>Don Guilan</hi> and <hi>Ladaſin,</hi> purſued another knight, whome they ſlew, and returning backe againe, they knew the king, which ſtroke them into no little maruaile, becauſe they heard nothing of his miſ-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: then alighting from their horſes, they took off their helmets and did him reuerence, when hee knowing them right well, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them in his armes, ſaying. My friends, you haue ſuccoured me in a needefull time, for which I may liue to requite you with thankes: yet haue you wronged me by your abſence from the Court, and for your loue to each other I loſt you both, eſpecially, you Lord <hi>Guilan,</hi> your minde being elſe-where, made you forget me. Theſe words cauſed a modeſt bluſh in <hi>Don Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> beauſe the king diſciphered his loue, which was the Ducheſſe of <hi>Briſtoya,</hi> who was not one iot behinde him in affection: as well witneſſed the good entertainment ſhe gaue him, taſting together the fruit of their contentment. Which the Duke ſo doubted, and dayly conceiued ſuch ſtrange ſuſpition thereof, as it procured the iniurie was done to <hi>Galaor,</hi> when the Dwarffe eſpied him in the garden, at his returne from faire <hi>Aldena;</hi> whereby the Damoſell was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of burning, as the hiſtory here-tofore hath declared to you.</p>
                  <p>But while the king thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with <hi>Don Guilan, Galaor</hi> had got the Nephew of <hi>Arcalaus</hi> beſide his horſe, and tyed the chaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his neck, the king was bound withall: then taking the beſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes belonged to the dead knights, they rode toward <hi>London.</hi> And by the way, <hi>Ladaſin</hi> recounted to the king, how he contended with <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> for riding ſo faſt, offering him the combate, which he refuſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would delay no time for his ſuccour: which cauſed the king to requite him with many thankes, that he could ſo well forbeare in a caſe of ſuch neceſſity. But my Lord, quoth <hi>Don Guilan,</hi> my hap was more hard, for by thinking on her, who oftentimes makes mee to forget my ſelfe, a knight encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with mee, and by force of his Lance, caſt me from my ſaddle.

Whereupon, ſo ſoone as the two knights were parted from them, they haſted to report theſe newes in <hi>London:</hi> which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch a murmuring through the Citty, eſpecially among the knights, as they preſently armed themſelues, and mounted on horſe backe in ſuch troupes, as the fields were quickly couered with men &amp; horſes. At this time was king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> of <hi>Norwales</hi> talking with the Queene, little thinking on any miſ-fortune: when one of his Squires bringing his Armour, ſayde My Lord, you tarry heere trifling too long, arme your ſelfe quickely &amp; followe the reſt, who by this time haue gotten ſo farre as the Forreſt.</p>

And thither <hi>Barſinan</hi> now prepared, hoping to take the Queen as hee had done the tower: but he met with ſtronger reſiſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he expected, and the skirmiſhes proceeding on either ſide, <hi>Barſinan</hi> took a priſoner, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, how king <hi>Arba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Remember the cauſe of your fight, not onely to maintaine your good king, but your owne liberty: againſt a tirant, traitour, and what worſe? who would buy his vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in this Kingdome, with the blood of you, your wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Saw you not how he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them hee tooke in the Tower? Beholde you not the end of his purpoſe? which is to ruinate this noble Realme, that hath (by diuine prouidence) beene ſo long time preſerued, and euer-more conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in reputation, flouriſhing with loyal ſubiects to their Prince? Heard you not the flattering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, which the Rebell vſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aſſault, thinking to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vs by his golden tongue? In vaine is his labour, I am right well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that no one of you but will die a thouſand deathes, before he ſhall conceiue any other minde in you, I ſee by your reſolued countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if I ſhould thinke or ſay other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I were a monſtrous offender: for if he haue more men then wee, wee haue more hearts of courage then he, which forbiddeth all acca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of diſmaying, ſetting before your eyes, the famous account you ſhal liue in hereafter. By their looks you might diſerne at their retire, how vnwillingly they wil be to trie you againe: and reſpect not the traiterous words of <hi>Barſinan,</hi> our king liueth, and will right ſpeedily come to ſuccour vs. In meane while I intreat as my friendly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, let nothing diſmay your hope, but continue as you haue begun: with famous reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is more honourable to die for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, then to enioy a life by thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſlauerie, vnder a wicked, iniurous, and traiterous Prince. When the king had ended his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was no one in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, how ſore hurt ſoeuer he was, but would couragiouſly encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Barſinans</hi> power, and bid him brauely good-morrow next day in the Tower: wherewith the king not a little contented, returned to the Queenes lodging his face couered with ſweate, and his armour all bloody, by reaſon of fiue woundes he receiued in fight. The Ladyes ſeeing him in ſuch pittious plight, were maruailouſly abaſhed, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Queene, who well neere dead with griefe and fear together then as a woman in middeſt of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, ſhe ſaid: Alas deer Nephew, what ſhall wee doe? wee are all but

Madame, anſwered king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> all will go well if God be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in vaine doe you thus diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort your ſelfe, for I hope to heare good tydings of the King: and his traytours that ſeeke to vſurpe the kingdome, by your good and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſubiects ſhall receiue deſerued puniſhment. God grant it, quoth ſhe, but you are ſo wounded, as I thinke it impoſſible for you to bee at the battell, if <hi>Barſinan</hi> come to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow againe, nor can our men doe any thing without you. Be not you troubled therewith Madame, replyed king <hi>Arban,</hi> for while my ſoule ſucks her ſpirit from the ayre, I will not forſake my charge. So bidding her good night, hee went to haue his wounds dreſſed, and afterward turned to his ſouldiers, merrily paſſing the night among them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Barſinan</hi> on the other ſide, got into the Tower of <hi>London</hi> which he had wonne, and numbring his men, found that his power was greatly weakened: yet would hee make no ſhew thereof for diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt, but ſhewing a diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling countenance, thus ſpake to them. My friends, it ſufficeth that I haue ſhewen mine enemies what you are, and they (if I think good) to ſtand at my mercy: wherfore I am determined (without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſſe of you) to reſt our ſelues fiue or ſixe dayes, till <hi>Arcalaus</hi> ſend me the head of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and then the ſight therof, wil make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not dare to reſiſt mee any longer, but in hope of fauour, will yeeld themſelues. Each of you therefore reioyce and be of good cheere, for when I am King, right richly will I reward you all. So went they to reſt till the next, morning, when <hi>Barſinan</hi> (being armed) mounted on horſe-backe, with twenty knights in his company, and came to a Port which one of king <hi>Arbans</hi> knights kept, who ſeeing this troupe, preſently ſounded an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme. But <hi>Barſinan</hi> ſent him word how hee came to parle onely, and deſired truce beſide for ſix houres: whereof king <hi>Arban</hi> was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly aduertiſed, who granted the truce <hi>Barſinan</hi> requited, &amp; likewiſe for fiue dayes. Conditionally, that he ſhould offer no violence to any houſe in the City, or practiſe any entrance during the limited time: beſide, if the King returned in that ſpace, the difference ſhould bee left to his diſpoſition. <hi>Barſinan</hi> was contented with theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe hee accounted king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> death certaine, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee ſaide to <hi>Arban.</hi> I hope this little truce, will be an entrance into a perpetuall peace betweene vs: for I dare aſſure yee, king <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> is dead, and his daughter muſt be my wife, as within theſe fiue dayes enſuing you ſhall euidently ſee.

hearing the fortunate ſucceſſe of his brother <hi>Galaor.</hi> There met hee with another likewiſe, who made report of <hi>Barſinans</hi> dealings at <hi>London,</hi> wherefore entring the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſo couertly as hee might, the firſt hee met withall was king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> of whom hee was louingly embraced and welcommed, with requeſt of what newes he brought. None but good, anſwered <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> and ſuch as you are deſirous to heare: but becauſe I doubt the Queene is ſcant merry, let vs goe ſee her, for happely ſhee will bee glad of our comming. So rode they to the Court together, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> ſtill keeping the Squire with him that came from the king, and when they entered the Queenes preſence, <hi>Amadis</hi> falling on his knee, beganne in this manner. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, this Gentleman left the King well this morning, and at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, whereof his Maieſty certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth you by him: my ſelfe likewiſe (not long ſince) left your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with <hi>Don Grumedan,</hi> and very ſhortly they will be with you. But becauſe I vnderſtand that <hi>Barſinan</hi> moleſteth you with trechery, ſuffer vs I pray you to goe ſee what hee can doe. When the Queen heard theſe ioyfull tydings, her inwarde content tooke away the liberty of of her ſpeech, nor could ſhe doe any thing but lift her hands &amp; eyes to heauen, applauding his name from whence this good procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and by geſtures deliuering ſome ſigne of thankes to <hi>Amadis.</hi> At length hauing ouercome this delightfull paſſion, and intending to queſtion further concerning theſe newes: the allarme was ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, wherefore king <hi>Arban</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> hyed to the barres, where they found <hi>Barſinans</hi> men giuing an eager charge, as hoping to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the contrarie part. But <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> thruſting himſelfe for-moſt, cauſed the bars to be taken down, and accompanied with king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> brake in couragiouſly vpon the enemy, a noble preſident to their ſouldiers, who beeing chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by this onſet, tooke heart and followed. Now wexed the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh to be hot indeed, ſo that on both ſides very many were ſlaine, which <hi>Barſinan</hi> perceiuing, &amp; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in his multitude to ſuppreſſe the weaker part, came formoſt himſelfe in perſon, thinking (now hee ſaw the barres open) to driue his aduerſaries backe againe into the Citie. When <hi>Amadis</hi> noted his forwardneſſe he ſtepped backe, &amp; changed his Creaſt and Shield with a ſimple mercinary ſouldier: yet reſeruing his Launce, which with a ſtrong carreer pierced tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough his Armour, and wounding <hi>Barſinan,</hi> brake in peeces in his fleſh. Then drawing his ſword, he gaue him ſuch a ſtroke on the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, as hee was aſtonied therewith, and redoubling his blowe, cut his right arme quite from his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: when <hi>Barſinan</hi> (feeling himſelf ſo wounded) would haue retyred backe, to ſaue himſelfe by the ſpeed of his horſe, but hee fell to the ground as depriued of his ſences. Wherefore <hi>Amadis</hi> left him, and ſet vpon the reſt, who beeing vnable to endure theſe hotte aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, likewiſe beholding their Lord diſmounted: took the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to flight for ſafety of their liues, yet were they ſo cloſely followed, as the moſt part of them were ſlain in the field, and ſome few of them eſcaped into the Tower, cauſing the bridge to be quickly drawen vp after them.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Amadis</hi> returned where he left <hi>Barſinan</hi> &amp; becauſe he
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7179:118"/>
was not yet dead, commanded he ſhould be carried to the Queenes lodging, there to bee kept till the Kings returne: and as hee would haue put vp his ſword, hee ſawe it ſoyled with blood, wherefore in wiping it, hee ſaide: Thou truſtie ſworde, in a happy houre was the knight born to whom thou belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt: and as thou art one of the beſt in the world, ſo is thy Maſter the moſt vertuous Prince liuing.

they were in great want of victals, they yeelded themſelues to the Kings mercy, the moſt part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being (for examples ſake) hanged on the battlements, and the reſt ſet at liberty vpon humble ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

                  <p>After the King had eſcaped theſe misfortunes, the former ioyes and paſtimes beganne againe: during which time, the Lady and her two ſonnes (the meſſengers of <hi>Madaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> who were witneſſes when <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> and <hi>Amadis</hi> promiſed to forſake king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> ſeruice) arriued at the Court. When the two Princes were aduertiſed thereof, they went and friendly entertained her, ſhee ſaying: Gentlemen you know the cauſe of my comming, are you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to keepe your promiſe? We are, quoth they, and will not breake our couenant with <hi>Madaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> but preſently will performe it before the King. Entring the great Hall, the Lady fell on her knees before his Maieſty, deliuering theſe ſpeeches. My Lord, I am come to your Court, to ſee if theſe two knights will obſerue a couenant, which in my preſence they made to a Lady. What was it? anſwered the King. A matter that will ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ant like you, quoth the Lady, or any ſuch as beare you affection: and thereto ſhee added the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance. Wherat the King wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat offended, told <hi>Galaor</hi> that hee had very much wronged him. My Lord, replyed <hi>Galaor,</hi> it was better to do ſo, then be treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſlaine, for had wee been a knowne, neither you, nor all the world could haue faued our liues: but let not your Maieſty be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for the remedy ſhall be more ready then you expect. In accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing my promiſe to <hi>Madaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> of <hi>Gantaſi,</hi> my Lord I take my leaue of you, departing altogether from your ſeruice: certifying you that it is her will to doe you this diſpleaſure, and worſe if ſhe ſhould compaſſe it, for the extreame mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice ſhe beareth to you. <hi>Amadis</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed what his brother had done, then <hi>Galaor</hi> turning to the Lady &amp; her two ſonnes, ſayd. Haue we not now accompliſh our promiſe? Yes truely, quoth the Lady, wee muſt needs auouch ſo much. You may then returne when you pleaſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> but tell <hi>Madaſima,</hi> ſhe did not ſo much as ſhe weened, as you may perceiue by the preſent effect. Now my Lord, quoth he to the King, we haue fulfilled our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Madaſima,</hi> and becauſe in graunting her earneſt deſire, the time was not limited how long we ſhould leaue your ſeruice: we may enter thereinto againe when you pleaſe to command, ſo that we are yours as faithfull as before. When the King and all that were preſent heard what had paſt, they reioyced exceedingly, eſteeming <hi>Galaor</hi> &amp; <hi>Amadis</hi> well aduiſed herein: where-upon the King thus ſpake to the Lady. According to her great treaſon vnder ſhaddowe of good meaning, they are bound to no more then they haue accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for to deceiue the deceiuer is no deceit. And ſay to <hi>Madaſima,</hi> ſeeing ſhe hateth me ſo vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, ſhe once had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in her power, who might haue grieued me all my life time: but God hauing in other places deliuer'd me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many perils wil not ſuffer me to periſh by ſo bad

woman as ſhe is. I deſire yee my Lord, quoth ſhe, to tell mee their names. The one is <hi>Amadis,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the King, and the other his brother <hi>Galaor.</hi> May it be poſſible, ſay de the Lady, that <hi>Madaſima</hi> had <hi>Amadis</hi> in her power? Credit me, quoth the King, I haue tolde yee truth. Their fortune was good, replyed the Lady, for they might not haue eſcaped if ſhe had known them: and in ſooth the deede might bee reckoned ominous, if two ſuch worthy perſons had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. Yet when ſhe ſhall knowe hereof, ſayd the King, I thinke ſhe will forbeare to wrong me any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. With that the Lady tooke her leaue, ſhaping her courſe the ſame way ſhe came.</p>

                     <hi>Grumedan</hi> ſpeaking for all the reſt, ſayd.

In good faith, anſwered the King, if it bee ſo, hee hath attempted an ouer fond warre, for I thinke there is no knight in the worlde ſo puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, that will bee induced to ſuch an enterpriſe. But forbeare at this time, and offer him no iniury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is heere to receiue iuſtice: which ſhall be done, according to the counſell of the Princes and Lords preſent, without fauouring any one. Then <hi>Oliuas</hi> falling on his knee before the King, beganne in this manner. My Lord, the Duke who ſtandeth before your Maieſty, hath ſlaine a Coſen germaine of mine, hee neuer giuing him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of offence: wherefore I will iuſtifie him to bee a villaine and a traytour, and will make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it with his owne mouth, elſe ſhall I kill him and caſt him forth of the field. The Duke tolde him hee lyed, and hee was ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh what the King and his Court ſhould ordaine: wherupon it was determined, that this emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould bee decided by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, which the Duke accepted, deſiring the King to permit him &amp; his two Nephewes in this cauſe, againſt <hi>Oliuas</hi> and two other knights. This being granted, the Duke was very glad thereof, for he made ſuch account of his kinſmen, as hee thought <hi>Oliuas</hi> could not bring the like: notwithſtanding, all was deferred till the morrowe following.</p>
                  <p>In meane while, <hi>Don Galuanes</hi> asked his Nephew <hi>Agraies,</hi> if hee wold aſſiſt <hi>Oliuas</hi> againſt the Duke, and hee conſenting thereto, <hi>Galua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> came to <hi>Oliuas,</hi> ſaying. Sir <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuas,</hi> ſeeing the Duke is deſirous to fight three againſt three, my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew and I are determined to take your part: which when the Duke heard, hee remembred that he had defied them in his owne houſe, when <hi>Agraies</hi> combated with the Dwarffes champion, at what time the Damoſell ſhould haue beene burned: wherefore hee became ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry penſiue, in reſpect though he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed his Nephewes approued good knights, yet he repented his wilfull offer, &amp; gladly would haue excuſed the matter if hee could, being ſo well acquainted with the behauiour of <hi>Galuanes</hi> &amp; <hi>Agraies.</hi> But conſidering his promiſe paſt before the King, and ſo many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſonages there preſent, hee muſt of neceſſity ſtand thereto: wherefore the next morning hee entered the Liſtes with his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, and <hi>Oliuas</hi> on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with his copartners. Now were the Ladies ſtanding at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, to beholde the iſſue of this quarrell, and among the reſt ſtood <hi>Oliuia</hi> the faire friend to <hi>Agraies,</hi> who ſeeing him ready to enter ſuch perill, was ſo diſmayed, as ſhe could ſcant tell what countenance to vſe. By her ſtood <hi>Mabila,</hi> ſhee being in no leſſe griefe for her Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and brother together: likewiſe the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> louing them both, in reſpect of the reaſons heretofore declared, accompanied the two Ladies in ſorrowe, fearing their danger: but the knights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to the combate, the King by a Herald commanded the Champions to doe their deuoyre. Heereupon with a braue carreer they encountred together, <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Galuanes</hi> vnhorſing the two Nephewes, and albeit <hi>Oliuas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a wound on the ſtomacke, yet had not the Duke caught
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7179:120"/>
hold about his horſe neck, his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had proued as had as his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drawing their ſwords, they ſmote ſo violently againſt ech other, as the ſtanders by wondered at their fiercenes: beholding their ſhields defaced, their armour bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred &amp; coullered with their blood, that the victorie hung a long time in ſuſpence. For <hi>Agraies</hi> horſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlaine vnder him, brought his life in maruailous hazard, becauſe the Duke and one of his Nephews ſtroue to keep him downe, ſeeking to thruſt their ſwords into his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or elſe to ſmite his head from his ſhoulders: but he was ſo well armed, and of ſuch courage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as hee held them both play, though with exceeding perill. Well may you thinke, that his friends grieued to ſee him in this diſtreſſe, eſpecially the three La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, of whom we ſpake ſo lately, whoſe cheekes were bedewed with whole fountaines of teares, and wofull <hi>Oliuia</hi> ſeemed rather dead then liuing. But had he long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this extreamity, her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt houer muſt needes haue enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet at length he recouered him-ſelfe, charging the Duke and his Nephewes with ſuch puiſſant ſtrokes, as well declared his hardy courage. <hi>Oliuas</hi> all this while was in ſuch caſe, by reaſon of the ſore wound the Duke gaue him, that he could hardly defend himſelfe: which the Duke perceiuing, hee left his Nephew with <hi>Agraies,</hi> and aſſailing <hi>Oliuas</hi> very roughly, made him fall downe in a great aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But as he would haue ſlaine him, <hi>Agraies</hi> ſtepped betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (hauing diſpatched his enemie of his head) and hindred the Duke from his determination, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him in many places on his body, that he could ſcant tel which way to turne him. <hi>Don Galuanes,</hi> likewiſe hauing ſlaine the other Nephew, came to aſſiſt <hi>Agraies</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Duke, who ſeeing his life at the lateſt exigent, turned his horſe to eſcape away: but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> gaue him ſuch a ſtroke on the helmet, as hee fell beſide his ſaddle, with one of his feete han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the ſtirrop, when the horſe being at libertie, feeling his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then hang on the one ſide, ranne flinging vp and downe, none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to reskew the Duke, till his necke was broken with drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging along. Hereupon <hi>Agraies</hi> left him, returning to his vncleto know how he fared. Very well I thanke God, anſwered <hi>Galuanes,</hi> but it grieueth mee that <hi>Oliuas</hi> is dead, for hee lieth ſtill and moueth not. Right ſorry likewiſe was <hi>Agraies</hi> to heare theſe words, wherefore commanding the Duke and his Nephewes bodyes to be throwne foorth of the field, they came both to <hi>Oliuas,</hi> and finding him aliue, as alſo his wounds not to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, they bound them vp ſo well as they could, ſaying.

ſhee would haue caſt her ſelfe forth at the window, had not <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bila</hi> and the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> ſtayed her. Now riſeth frowning anger in her brows, and ſhe to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiue of the man, whoſe onely deſire was to do her ſeruice, With often wringing her hands, ſhe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to remembrance, in what ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt affection he deſired leaue for this voyage, which augmented her ſuſpition of the Dwarffes wordes: and in ſuch ſort was her heart ſhut vp, as no teare might fall from her eyes, becauſe thoſe vapours were withdrawne to the moſt worthie places in her. Hereupon her tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments redoubled in extreames, as <hi>Dido</hi> for the the tromperie of <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi> or ſad <hi>Medea,</hi> ſeeing her ſelfe forſaken of her friend <hi>Iaſon,</hi> neuer felt ſuch anguiſh: and in fatall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhee would haue ſucceeded them, but that ſhe was hindred by them about her, who found the meanes to defend her from ſuch miſhap.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Dwarffe ouer-tooke <hi>Amadis</hi> and the reſt, when they began to ride ſomwhat faſter, <hi>Amadis</hi> not requiring any thing of him, nor he reciting what he tolde the Princeſſe, but ſhewed him the peeces of the Sworde he brought. Not farre had they ridden, but they met a Damoſell, who after ſhe had ſaluted them, demanded whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they trauailed, ſaying, ſhee would aduiſe them to forſake that way. Wherefore? anſwered <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi> Becauſe, quoth ſhe, for the ſpace of fifteene dayes, no Knight errant paſſed this way, but he hath beene eyther wounded or ſlaine. And who hath done them ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure? ſaid <hi>Amadis.</hi> A Knight, anſwered the Damoſell, the moſt valiant man at Armes that euer was ſeene. I pray ye Damoſell, quoth <hi>Agraies,</hi> bring vs where wee may ſee him. You cannot ride far in this Forreſt, ſaid ſhe, but he will quickly ſhew himſelfe. So trauail they on with the Damoſell, and long time they neyther heard not ſaw any one, which made them thinke ſhee ſpake theſe words to feare them: yet ſoone after, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> eſpyed the Knight, who ſeemed a man of goodly ſtature, and ready prepared for the combat. As hee and his companions ſtood behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, they heard him ſpeak to a ſquire, who reared foure Launces againſt a Tree, and afterward came to them, ſaying. Gentlemen, my Maiſter giueth you to vnderſtand, how during the ſpace of fifteene dayes, hee hath vndertaken the guard of this Forreſt, in all which time his fortune hath beene, not to be vanquiſhed by any one: And though it be a day and a halfe ſince his intended tearme is expired, yet ſtayeth hee here till now for the pleaſure he hath in Iouſting. And as he was departing hence, he eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you comming: wherefore hee letteth you know, that if each of you will breake a Launce, he careth not to try his fortune with you, prouided, that the combat at the Sword be ſpared, becauſe hee ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome proceedeth ſo farre without doing more harme then willingly he would.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Agraies</hi> heard this meſſage, hee tooke his Armes, returning this anſwere: Friend, goe tell thy Maiſter I am content to try the Iouſt with him. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he gaue the ſpurres to his horſe, and the knight ſeeing him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gaue forth to meete him, their Launces being broken in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter: But <hi>Agraies</hi> was eaſily caſt from his Horſe, of which foyle he could not but be aſhamed.

                     <hi>Galaor</hi> beholding his Cozin diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, determined to reuenge his wrong, bidding the knight to prepare himſelfe, who taking ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Launce, ran againſt <hi>Galaor</hi> with ſuch furie, as after their ſtaues were broken, their bodies met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo vehemently, that <hi>Galaors</hi> horſe being more feeble then the other, fell downe with his Maſter on bis back, but the Prince not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering himſelfe, was left on the ground, when the horſe aroſe, and ran about the field, as the other of <hi>Agrates</hi> did. <hi>Amadis</hi> abaſhed at theſe accidents, preparing himſelf, ſaid to the Knight.

So coutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Launce, proceeded for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but <hi>Galaor</hi> ſtayed him, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Knight to the combat, which made <hi>Amadis</hi> thus to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.

Certes my Lord, my iourney is ſhortned, for I ſeeke you. Then you haue now found me, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> what is your will with me?

Then eſpying a faire Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle on the top of a high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the Damoſell told him, there was no other place neere where they might lodge that night: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he being glad to accept there-of, they came to the Caſtle, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many Gentlemen and Ladies ſporting together, among whom was a Knight aged about three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore yeares, who taking <hi>Galaor</hi> by the hand, did him all the honour might be deuiſed. My Lord, quoth, <hi>Galaor,</hi> your courteſie to vs is ſo great, that albeit we were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7179:124"/>
to paſſe further on our way, yet for your ſake we are content to ſtay with you this night. Then the knight conducted <hi>Galaor,</hi> into a faire Chamber, leauing the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell among the other Ladies; and after the Prince was vnarmed, the knight ſpake to him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Here Sir may you reſt and take your eaſe, calling for any thing you ſtand in neede of: for God knows I haue vſed ſuch enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement not onely to you, but to all knights errant that paſſed this way, becauſe ſome time I haue beene as now you are. Yet hath nature giuen mee two Sonnes, whoſe onely delight is in ſearch of aduentures, but now they lie ſicke in their beds, beeing cruelly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Knight, who with one Launce caſt them both from their Saddles. But they were ſo aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at this foyle, as they mounted againe and purfued the knight, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaking him as hee entred a Barque to paſſe the water, where my Sonnes ſaid to him, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he had iouſted ſo well, they would trie his fortune in combat with the Sword: but the knight made anſwere he could not now intend it, yet would they needes preſſe him ſo farre, as to hinder his entrance into the Barque. Where-upon a Lady being in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſaid, they wronged her ouer-much to ſtay her Knight: but they were not to depart, til he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated with them at the Sword. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it will be no otherwiſe replied the Lady, he ſhall enter fight with the better of you both, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if he be conqueror, the other do forbeare the Combat. They anſwered, if the one were vanquiſhed, the other would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge his foyle, which when the Knight heard, he was ſo angry, as he bad them both come together, in reſpect they were importunate and would not reſt contented. In the triall, one of my ſons ſuſtained the worſt, wherefore his brother ſeeing him in ſuch perill, ſtroue to reskue him from death: yet all was in vaine, for the knight handled them ſo roughly, as he left them like dead men in the field, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward paſſed away in the Barque. No ſooner heard I of this miſhap, but I ſent for my Sonnes, &amp; home were they brought in this daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous plight: but that you may giue credit to my words, behold here their Armour cut and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, as I thinke the like ſtroakes neuer came from any mans hand. <hi>Galaor</hi> maruailing at this diſcourſe, demanded what Armes the conquering knight bare: when he was anſwered, his Shield to be of vermilion colour, with two black Lions figured therein: By theſe tokens <hi>Galaor</hi> knew him, that it was the ſame man he trauailed to finde, which made him demand of his friendly hoſt, if he had no further knowledge of the Knight. No verily Sir, quoth the auncient Gentleman. For this night, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> let vs take our reſt, and to morrow I intend to ſeeke the man you talke of.

when taking leaue of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient knight, he rode away with the Damoſell, who brought him to the place of paſſage in the Barque: where croſſing the water to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, they came to a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Caſtle, whither the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel rode before, aduiſing the Prince to ſtay her returne. She taryed not long, but comming back againe, brought another Damoſel with her of excellent beauty, and ten men beſide all on horſe-back: after the faire Gentlewoman had ſaluted <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſhe ſaid. Sir, this Damoſell that came in your company, telleth me, how you ſeeke a knight, who beareth two black Lyons in a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million ſhield, and are deſirous to know his name: this is very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that you nor any other can finde him for three yeeres ſpace, but onely by force of armes, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not ſo eaſie to be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by you, for perſwade your ſelfe, his like is not to be found in all the Iſles of great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> yet will I not giue ouer his ſearch, although hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale him ſelfe in this ſort: and if I meete with him, it ſhall like mee better to combate with him, then to know my demand by any other way. Seeing then, anſwered the Damoſell, your deſire is ſuch, I will ſhew you him within three dayes enſuing, for this Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſake, being my coſin, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her promiſe hath ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly entreated me. <hi>Galaor</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with many thankes, and ſo they trauailed on, arriuing in the euening at an arme of the Sea, where they found a Barque ready for paſſage to a liule Iſland, and certaine mariners in it, who made them all ſweare, if they had any more then one knight in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. No, credit me, replied the Damoſell: hereupon they ſet ſayle and away. Then <hi>Galaor</hi> demanded of the Damoſell, the reaſon why they tooke ſuch an oath. Becauſe, quoth ſhe, the Lady of the Iſle whither we goe, hath ſo ordained it, that they ſhall let paſſe but one knight at one time: and no other muſt they bring till his returne, or credible intelligence of his death. What is hee, ſaide <hi>Galaor,</hi> that vanquiſheth or killeth them? The ſelfe ſame knight you ſeeke, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Damoſell, whom the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath kept with her more then halfe a yeere, intirely louing him: and the cauſe of this affection proceedeth from a Tourney, which not long ſince hee maintained in this countrey, for the loue of her and another faire Lady, whom the knight (being a ſtanger here) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, defending her cauſe with whome he now is, and euer ſince ſhee bare him ſuch affection, as without grant of his loue ſhe wold haue dyed. Sometime hee is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſeeke after ſtrange aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but then the Lady to detaine him ſtill in this place, cauſeth ſuch knights as come hither to paſſe one after another againſt whom he combateth, and not one hath yet returned vnuanquiſhed: ſuch as die in fight are there interred, and the foyled ſent back againe, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyled of their horſe and armes, which the knight preſenteth to his Lady, ſhee being one of the faireſt creatures in the world, named <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſanda,</hi> and the Iſle <hi>Brauiſande.</hi> Know you not the cauſe, ſaid <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> wherefore the knight went not many dayes ſince, to a Forreſt where I found him, and kept the paſſage there fifteene dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, againſt all ſuch as trauailed that way? Yes mary, quoth the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſel, he promiſed a boone to a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7179:125"/>
Lady before he came hither, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe intreated him to keep the Forreſt for the ſpace of fifteene dayes: yet hardly hee got licence of his faire Miſtreſſe, who allowed him but a moneth to ſtay and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</p>
                  <p>By this time they were landed, and come before a goodly Caſtle, where ſtood a pillar of Marble, with a horne hanging on it, which the Damoſell bad him winde, and the Knight would come forth at the ſound thereof. After he had giuen a good blaſt, certaine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges came forth of the Caſtle, who ſet vp a Pauilion in the middeſt of the field, and ſix Ladies (ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) came walking forth one of them ſeeming by her geſture and countenance, to be commander of the reſt, taking her place accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in the Tent. I maruaile, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> the knight tarryeth ſo long, I deſire one of you to will the Lady ſend for him, becauſe buſines elſe-where of great importance, forbiddeth me to trifle time here in vaine. One of the Damoſells ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled his requeſt. What? anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Coriſanda,</hi> maketh he ſo ſmall account of our Knight? thinketh hee ſo eaſily to eſcape from him? hath he ſuch mind of other affaires before hee ſee the end of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt? indeede I thinke he ſhall returne ſooner then he expecteth, but with ſlender aduantage for him to bragge of: then calling a Page, ſhe ſaid. Goe and bid the ſtrange Knight come forth. The Page quickly did his meſſage, and ſoone after, the Knight came forth on foote, being all armed except with his Helmet, which was brought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him with his Launce, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Page leading his Courſer: when he came before his Lady, ſhe ſaid. Behold Sir, here is a braue Knight, who thinketh lightly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome you, &amp; accounteth him-ſelfe aſſured of the victory: I pray you let him know the price of his folly. After theſe wordes ſhe kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and embraced him, but <hi>Galaor</hi> noting all theſe miſteries, thought he tarried too long from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat: at length the Knight being mounted, they prepared themſelus to the cariere, and breaking their Launces in the encounter, were both wounded. <hi>Galaor</hi> preſently drew his Sword, but the knight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to louſt once more. With all my heart, replyed <hi>Galaor,</hi> yet I am ſory my horſe is not ſo good as yours, for if it were: I could be content not to giue ouer till one of vs lay along on the ground, or all theſe Launces bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in peeces. The Knight made him no anſwere, but commanded a ſquire to bring them other ſtaues, and meeting together, <hi>Galaors</hi> horſe was almoſt down: the knight likewiſe loſt his ſtirrops, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad to catch holde by the mane of his horſe, whereat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Hereupon they fell to the combat, which began and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with ſuch fury, as the Ladies, were driuen into wonderfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, yea, themſelues were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed

that they held out ſo long, hauing their Armour mangled, their Shields defaced, their Bodies ſore wounded, and the blood ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming downe vpon their horſes: <hi>Galaor</hi> neuer being in ſuch daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his life, but when hee fought with his brother <hi>Amadis,</hi> which made him carry better opinion of the Knight, and both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad to breath a while, <hi>Galaor</hi> entred into theſe ſpeeches. You ſee Sir I haue the better of the combat, let me therfore know your name, and why you conceale your ſelfe ſo cloſely: wherein you ſhall doe me very great pleaſure, and wee may continue friends, elſe worſe will enſue then you imagin. Be wel aſſured anſwered the knight our ſtrife ſhall not be ended ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, nor am I to bee ouercome ſo lightly as you weene, beſide, I was neuer more deſirous to prolong a combat, then I am at this inſtant, becauſe I neuer met with the knight that tryed me ſo well: but to you nor any other will I bee knowne, except one Knight who hath power to command me. Be not ſo opinitiue, replyed <hi>Galaor,</hi> for I ſweare to you by the faith I owe to God, neuer to leaue you till I know whar you are, and why you conceale your ſelfe ſo ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And I ſweare to you, quoth the knight, while breath is in my body you ſhall not know it by me, and rather would I preſently die, then any but two ſhould vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what I am: yet I know not them, but they may and ſhall haue knowledge of me. And what are they, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> you eſteeme ſo much? Neither will I diſcloſe them to you, anſwered the knight. Both them and my former demaund, quoth <hi>Galaor,</hi> I will know, elſe one of vs ſhall die, or both together. I am well pleaſed therewith, replyed the Knight.</p>
                  <p>So began they to charge each other a freſh, as if they had not fought together before at all: but the ſtrange knight receiued many cruell wounds, which made his ſtrength more and more to faile: and the Lady ſeeing the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his life, would ſuffer him to endure no longer perill, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſaid.

This Gentleman is named <hi>Don Floreſtan,</hi> concealing himſelfe in this ſecret manner to finde his two brethren, who are in this country accounted ſuch men at Armes, that albeit hee hath well tried himſelfe with you, yet will hee not bee commonly knowne, till he haue accompliſhed ſuch deedes in chiualrie, as ma de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to equall him with them, who are at this time in King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, one of them being named <hi>Amadis,</hi> the other <hi>Galaor,</hi> and all

What? ſaid the knight am I then your brother? According to this Ladies ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> you are, and I am your brother <hi>Galaor. Floreſtan</hi> amazed at this accident, fell on his knee, ſaying. My Lord, I deſire you to pardon me, for this offence in combatting vnknown with you, was cauſed by no other reaſon: but that I durſt not name my ſelfe your brother, till I had made ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations of your noble vertues, <hi>Galaor</hi> courteouſly embraced him in his armes, the teares ſtreaming from his eyes with ioy, and gree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T what time King <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> ſought after ſtrange Aduentures, he ariued in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Almaigne,</hi> where he ſoiourned the ſpace of two yeares, accompliſhing many braue deedes of Armes, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne whereof continueth to this day. And as he returned toward <hi>Gaule</hi> hee lodged in the Counties houſe of <hi>Zealand,</hi> where he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained very royally, as well in reſpect of his owne reputation, as alſo becauſe the County himſelfe had ſometime beene a Knight er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, which made him loue all ſuch as followed Armes. After ſupper, the King was conducted to his Chamber, where being in bed, and ſomewhat wearie with trauaile, he fell a ſleepe ſoundly: but to ſhake off this heauineſſe, he felt himſelfe embraced and kiſſed he knew not by whom, when ſtarting vp to ariſe, he was ſo held down that he could not. Why Sir? quoth ſhe that thus maſtred him, take you no pleaſure in me who am alone with you? the king looking on her, by meanes of the light which ſtill burned in his Chamber, he diſcerned her to be a moſt beautifull Lady, wherefore he thus anſwered. I pray you faire friend, tell me what you are. What ſoeuer I am, quoth ſhe, I loue you exceedingly, as one that freely giues her ſelfe to you. In ſooth, replyed the King, I very gladly would know your name. You trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me, ſaid the Lady, with this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, yet can I vſe no other continence the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſee: but it were neceſſary quoth the king, I ſhould

know your name, if you meane to be my friend. Seeing you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine me thereto, anſwered the Lady, know that I am the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Daughter, who hath ſo friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained you. Now truſt me Madam, replyed the King, you muſt hold me excuſed, for I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die, then abuſe the man I am ſo much beholding to. Will you then refuſe me? quoth ſhe, well may you bee tearmed the worſt nurtured Prince in the world, in denying the conqueſt, which all your life time you might haue fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of. You may ſpeake your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, anſwered the King, but I will do what is conuenient for your honour and mine, and not offend in ſo foule a manner. I ſhall, quoth ſhe, cauſe my Father to thinke himſelfe more iniuried by you, then if you grant what I deſire. So ſtarting from the bed, ſhe tooke the Kings Sword (euen the ſame which was afterward found with <hi>Amadis,</hi> when he was taken vp on the Sea) and drawing it forth, ſhe ſet the point againſt her heart, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now ſhall my Fathers life be ſhortned by my death, whereof you are the onely cauſe. As ſhe vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered theſe words, ſhe offered to ſtab her ſelfe with the Sword: when the king ſuddenly ſtaying her hand and meruailing at her impatient loue, thus replyed. Hurt not your ſelfe Madam, for I am content to ſatisfie your will. Hereupon hee kindely embraced and kiſſed her, paſſing the night with her in ſuch ſort, as her hot deſire was quallifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and at that inſtant ſhe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with childe: the King little thinking thereon, for the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he tooke his leaue of her, and the Countie, returning with all ſpeede he could into <hi>Gaule.</hi> But the time of deliuerance drawing on, and ſhe (deſirous to couer her of fence) determined to goe viſit an Aunt of hers, whoſe dwelling was not paſt two or three miles off, and many times ſhe reſorted thithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for her pleaſure. So taking no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company with her but a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, as ſhee rode through the Forreſt, the payne of trauaile made her alight from her Palfrey ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoon after deliuered of a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sonne. The Damoſell that was with her, ſeeing what had happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, bringing the childe to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid. Madam, as your heart ſerued you to commit the offence, ſo muſt it now practiſe ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent remedy, while I returne from your Aunt againe. Then get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on horſeback, ſhe rode apace to her Ladies Aunt, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with the whole matter: which cauſed the old woman to be very ſorrowfull, yet ſhe prouided ſuccour for her Niece, ſending a Litter with all conuenient ſpeede, wherein the Lady and her childe were brought to her Caſtle ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, euery thing being ſo cunningly handled, as the Countie neuer knew his Daughters fault. After ſuch time as theſe matters require, the Lady returned home to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leauing her Sonne in her Aunts cuſtody, where he was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed till the age of eighteene yeeres, hauing Squires and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen attending on him, who daily inſtructed him in managing Armes, and all braue qualities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming a man of value. He being growne of goodly ſtature, the old Lady brought him one day to the Countie his Grand-father, who gaue him his knight-hood, not knowing what he was: &amp; returning againe with his motherly Nurſe, by the way ſhe brake with him in this manner. My Sonne, I am
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7179:127"/>
certaine you are ignorant of your parenatge, but credit my words, you are the ſon to King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> begotten on his daughtr that gaue you your order of knight-hood: endeuour your ſelfe therefore to follow your fathers ſteps, who is one of the moſt renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med knights in the world. Madam, quoth <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> oftentimes haue I heard great ſame of King <hi>Perion,</hi> but neuer imagined my ſelfe to be his ſon: wherefore I vow to you, being my long and carefull nurſe, that I will trauaile to fiude my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not make my ſelfe known to any one, till my deedes declare me worthy to be his ſon. Not long after, hee departed from the olde Ladie, and accompanied with two ſquires, iournied to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which at that time was greatly vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with warre, where he remained the ſpace of foure yeeres, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſuch haughty deedes of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie, as he was counted the beſt knight in all thoſe parts. When he perceiued himſelfe in ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he intended to viſit <hi>Gaule,</hi> and make himſelfe knowne to the king his father: but comming into great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> hee heard the fame of <hi>Amadis</hi> to be maruailous, which was the cauſe of his ſtay there, to win ſome report by armes, as his bretheren had done, whom he lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to acquaint himſelfe withall. At length he met with them both in the forreſt, as you heard, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward combated with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Galaor,</hi> which cauſed their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad at the Caſtle of <hi>Coriſanda,</hi> vntill ſuch time as their wounds were healed.</p>
                  <p>But now let vs returne to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and <hi>Agraies,</hi> who ſtaied with faire <hi>Briolania</hi> fiue daies together, preparing their armour and euery thing in order: which being done, they ſet forward on their way, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Briolania,</hi> her Aunt, certaine waiting Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſquires to doe them ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice by the way. When they drew neere the Realme of <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> they came to the Caſtle of an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Lady named <hi>Galumba,</hi> who ſometime liued in <hi>Briolanias</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Court, and there they were welcomed very honouarbly: yet whether <hi>Briolania</hi> trauailed thus accompanied, the olde Lady <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumba</hi> could not chuſe but mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, which made her requeſt tobe ſatisfied therein. <hi>Briolanias</hi> Aunt tolde her, how <hi>Amadis</hi> was one of the beſt knights in the world, and had promiſed to reuenge the murthered kings death: likewiſe how hee diſcomfited them that guarded the Chariot, and after-ward ouercame the reſt in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, at what time the Lions eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, as you haue heard. <hi>Galumba</hi> wondering at ſuch ſinguler prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe, anſwered. If he be ſuch a one as you make report, his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt needes be of ſome eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and well may they bring your enterpriſe to end, conſidering the truth and iuſtice of the cauſe: but take heede leaſt the traiterous king worke ſome treaſon againſt them. That is the chcefeſt pointe of my fear, i anſwered <hi>Briolania,</hi> wherfore wee came to craue your aduiſe herein. Heereupon ſhee wrote a letter, and ſealed it with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes ſeale at Armes, then caling a Damoſell, after ſhee had giuen her inſtructions, ſhe bad her make haſt in deliuering the letter. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently went the Damoſell to horſe-back, and trauailed ſo ſpeedily that ſhe arriued at the great Cittie of <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> which the whole Realme tooke this name by. There was <hi>Abiſeos</hi> and his Sonnes, <hi>Dariſon</hi>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:7179:127"/>
and <hi>Dramis,</hi> and theſe three muſt the Combat be waged withall: for <hi>Abiſeos</hi> ſlew the Father of <hi>Briola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> by couetous deſire he had to the Crowne, which he euer ſince vſurped and held, more by tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny then any conſent in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. The Damoſell entred the Palace on horſ-back, when diuerſe knights came to her, requeſting her to alight: but ſhe made anſwere ſhe would not, til ſhe ſaw the king, and that hee commanded her to leaue her Palfrey. Soone after came the king; accompanied with his two Sonnes and many great Lords, and after ſhee had ſaluted him, hee boldly bad her ſay what ſhe would. My Lord, quoth ſhe, I ſhall fulfill your command, on condition I may abide in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and receiue no iniurie for any thing I ſay. By my Crowne, ſaid the king, I warrant your ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: whereupon the Damoſell thus began. Sir, my Lady and Miſtreſſe <hi>Briolania,</hi> diſinherited by you, greetes you with this letter, which may openly bee read before this royall company, and I afterward receiue anſwere for my diſcharge: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king heard openly the na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of <hi>Briolania,</hi> remorſe of conſcience touched him with the wrong hee did her: yet was the letter openly read, which was to giue credit to the Damoſells words. The moſt of the Lords there preſent, who ſometime were ſubiects to the ſlaughtered king, ſeeing the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of their lawfull Queene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede: pittyed ſhe was ſo vniuſtly diſinherited, and in their hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of God, to plague the treaſon done to her Father: Proceede Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, quoth the king, and let vs heare your meſſage. My Lord, ſaid ſhe, by treaſon you murdred my Ladies Father, and vniuſtly keepe her from her inheritance: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to your former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which you haue not once but often times made, that you with your two Sons would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by Armes, the right you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to haue in this Realme: ſhee ſends you word by me, if ſtill you ſtand vpon ſuch triall, ſhee will bring two knights hither, who ſhal in combat maintaine her cauſe, making you know your diſloyalty and treaſon committed. <hi>Dariſon</hi> el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Sonne to the king, hearing his Father menaced in this ſort, grew into great choller, and as one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with deſpight, he aroſe, when (without the kings conſent) hee thus ſpake. Damoſell, if your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe <hi>Briolania</hi> haue two knights with her, men reſolued to fight on her behalfe: here do I accept the combat for my father and Brother, and if I faile, I promiſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all theſe Lords, to ſend hee my head in requitall of her fathers, whoſe death was not accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed without great reaſon. In ſooth Sir <hi>Dariſon,</hi> anſwered the Damoſell, you ſpeake as a knight of haughtie mind, yet may I doubt theſe words to proceed from chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, becauſe I diſcerne an alteration in your countenance: but if you will requeſt the king to confirme your ſpeeches, I ſhall thinke your proffer came from a heart of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
                  <p>This anſwere Damoſell, quoth he, may you boldly make her that ſent you hither. Cauſe then his Maieſty, ſaid the Damoſell, to giue my Ladies knights aſſurance, that for any miſhap you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in the Combat, they ſhall ſuſtaine no iniurie, nor be medled withall but by you three: And if you purchaſe them ſuch a ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, they ſhall bee here within

three dayes at the vttermoſt, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon</hi> falling on his knee before the King, ſaid. You heare (my Lord) the Damoſells demaund, and the promiſe I haue made before your Maieſly, in the preſence of all theſe great Princes and Lords: humbly therefore I beſeech you, ſeeing my honor is yours, that both you and all the reſt will confirme her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, otherwiſe, to our great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage, the preſuming knights, who dare aduenture in the cauſe of fooliſh <hi>Briolania,</hi> will imagine themſelues conquerors, and vs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide faint-hearted Cowards: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing openly publiſhed, that if any one will touch your illuſtrious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne for matters paſt, by the combat of vs three you intend to be purged. And albeit you would make them no ſuch promiſe, yet ought not we to refuſe them, for as I vnderſtand, they be ſome fooliſh knights of King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, who by their ouer-weening and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring thoughts, make high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ompt of their owne deedes in the contempt of others. The King who loued <hi>Dariſon</hi> as himſelfe, though the death of his brother condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him culpable, and thereby made him feare the combat: gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them ſafe conduit, according as the Damoſell requeſted for the two knights, and ſuch as came in their company. Here is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the period of this trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours Fortune was now limited, and the iuſtauenger of all wrongs, pointed out rewarde for the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him and his Sonnes, as in this diſcourſe may bee euidently ſeene.</p>
                  <p>The Damoſel ſeeing her meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage had taken ſuch effect as ſhee deſired, ſaid vnto them: Make your ſelues ready, for to morrow with-out fayle ſhall this difference bee deſided. So mounting on her Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, ſhe returned to the Caſtle of <hi>Galumba,</hi> where being arriued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the knights and Ladies, ſhe reported her anſwere: but when ſhe told them, that <hi>Dariſon</hi> reputed them fooliſh knights of king <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarts</hi> Court, they were ſo offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as <hi>Amadis</hi> entred into theſe ſpeeches. By God, there are ſuch in company of that good king, as can eaſily abate the pride of <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and humble his head ſo low as they liſt: but I thinke his choller o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-maſtred him, when he vttered words of ſuch great indiſcretion. Truſt me my Lord, anſwered <hi>Brio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lania,</hi> you cannot ſay or doe ſo much againſt theſe traytours, as they iuſtly deſerue. You know what vilanie they did to the king my Father, and how long time they haue diſinherited me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  <p>Madam, if God be ſo pleaſed, ere to morrow at night, your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſadneſſe, ſhall be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into pleaſure and content: her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they concluded, to ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward very early the next morning, which made them depart to their chambers, except <hi>Briolania,</hi> who ſat conferring with <hi>Amadis</hi> on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matters, when often times ſhe thought to motion marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and her: but ſuſpecting by his continuall ſighs, as alſo the teares ſtreaming from his eys, that ſome other Lady was cauſe of theſe paſſions, ſhe kept ſilence, and taking her leaue bad him good uight. On the morrow they go all to horſe-back, &amp; comming to the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7179:128"/>
Cittie of <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> their arriuall was very welcome to many, who ſeeing the Daughter of their late ſoueraigne Lord, and knowing the monſtrous treacherie of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they inſtantly deſired her proſperous ſucceſſe, becauſe they bare her ſinguler affection, <hi>Abiſeos</hi> remembring the wrong hee had done her, and his bloody treaſon ſo vnnaturally committed, ſeemed terrified in countenance, becauſe the worme of conſcience reuiued his heinous offence: yet hauing beene ſo long abſtinate and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in his ſinne, thought fortune would now aſſure his quietnes, and confirme his eſtate to continue in tranquility. But when he ſaw how the people flocked about her, not ſhewing any reuerence to him and his ſonnes, albeit they were royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompained with Lords, hee exclamed on them in this manner. Ah wretched and bad minded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I ſee what comfort you take by the preſence of this Girle, and how your ſences are caryed away with her: now may I well iudge, you rather could except her as your ſoueraigne, ſhe beeing a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man not capable of ſuch an office, then I that am a hardy knight. Her weakneſſe you may note, becauſe ſhee hath in ſo long time gotten but two knights, who are come to receiue an ignominious death, which in ſooth I cannot chuſe but pittie. When <hi>Amadis</hi> heard theſe taunting words, he was ſo enraged, as if the blood would haue guſhed from his eyes, and raiſing himſelfe on his ſtirrops, that euery one might heare him, hee thus anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Abiſeos,</hi> it may bee eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that the arriuall of the Princeſſe is ſcant pleaſing to thee, in reſpect of thy horrible treaſon committed, murdering her father thy eldeſt brother: but if thou haue any feeling of vertue, &amp; art repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant for thy foule miſ-deed, yeeld to her what thou haſt vniuſtly vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, ſo ſhall I diſcharge thee of the combate: prouided, thou aske God forgiuenſſe, and vſe ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as be ſeemeth a ſin ſo hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, that by loſing honour in this world, thou mayſt ſeeke the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy ſoule hereafter. <hi>Dariſon</hi> prouoked to anger by theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, aduanced himſelfe, &amp; before his father had leiſure to reply, hee preuented him in this manner. Thou fooliſh Knight of King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarts</hi> Court, hardly can I endure thy iniurous words to my father in my preſence: but I am content to defer them, till we proceede to the effect of thy demand, then ſhall I take ſuch vengeance for them as I deſire, for when thy heart ſhal faint in time of neede, weening to ſaue thy life by flight: if thou make not good haſt I will ſo chaſtiſe thee, as each one ſhall pittie thy miſerable eſtate. This is too long a proceſſe, ſaid <hi>Agraies,</hi> to defend thy fathers treaſon withall, goe arme thy ſelfe, and come to the combate as thou didſt promiſe, then ſhalt thou ſee if fortune bee ſo fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to giue thee the victory which thou reckoneſt aſſured: if ſhe doe otherwiſe, perſwade thy ſelfe, both thou and thine ſhal haue the meed of your wicked derſeruing. Say what thou wilt, anſwered <hi>Dariſon,</hi> ere long thy iniurious tongue puld from thy head, ſhall be ſent to the court of thy maiſter king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> that ſuch as behold thy worthy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, may be afraid to hazard the like by their liberall language. So calling for their armour, the king and his two ſons were quickly armed, then mounting on horſe-backe, they went to the place
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:7179:129"/>
appointed for Combats. Where-upon, <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Agraies</hi> lacing their Helmets, tooke their Shields and Launces, and afterward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the field. Then <hi>Dramis</hi> (who was the youngeſt brother, yet a Knight ſo valiant, as two of the beſt in that Countrey durſt not deale with him in Combat) ſaid to his Father. My Lord, where your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty and my brother are preſent, wel may I be excuſed from ſpeech, but now effects muſt ſhew it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by ſuch ſtrength as Heauen hath enabled me withall: therefore I deſire to try my Fortune with the Knight who hath ſo wronged you, and if I kill him not at the firſt taint of the Launce, neuer ſhall Armor come on my back againe: but if I meete him not ſo right as I deſire, he ſhall haue but little reſpite of life, for at the firſt ſtroake of my Sword, I will diſpatch him. Many heard the words of young <hi>Dramis,</hi> and eſteemed highly of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, nor did they greatly doubt the performance, conſidering what deedes of Armes they had ſeene him accompliſh. Now place they their Launces in their reſts, and <hi>Dramis</hi> prepared himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Amadis,</hi> who met him ſo full in the cariere, as his heart brake in his belly, and he fell to the ground ſo waightily, as if it had beene the fall of an Oxe. Get thee to all the Diuels, ſaid <hi>Dardan</hi> the Dwarffe, my maſter is very well rid of thee: but me thinks his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hath lighted on himſelfe, which commonly falls out ſo with ſuch great crackers. <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Dariſon</hi> brake their Launces in the encounter, but no other harme happened betweene them as yet.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Abiſeos</hi> ſaw his Son <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> was dead, he was meruailouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed, and intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge his death on <hi>Amadis,</hi> where-upon he gaue forth to meete him, and piercing his Launce thorow the Princes ſhield, gaue him a fore hurt on the Arme, which made the beholders doubt, that <hi>Amadis</hi> could hold out no longer. If then the young Princeſſe <hi>Briolania</hi> was diſmaide, it were in vaine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the queſtion: for now her heart dreaded further miſhap: but he who could not be daunted with common wounds, drew the ſword which he recouered from <hi>Arcala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now did the people meruaile not a little, to ſee <hi>Amadis</hi> at two ſtroakes ouerthrow two ſuch puiſſant Knights, eſteemed amongſt them the beſt in the World: but <hi>Amadis</hi> beholding no other reſiſtance, returned to <hi>Dariſon</hi> who fought with <hi>Agraies,</hi> they behauing themſelues ſo man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againſt each other, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thought they neuer ſaw a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer combat.</p>
                  <p>At length <hi>Abiſeos</hi> recouered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and ſeeing his Sonne <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in danger of his life, came to aſſiſt him, giuing <hi>Agraies</hi> ſuch a wound in the throate, as his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin thought he had beene ſlayne outright: But ſoone did hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite <hi>Abiſeos</hi> for it, by ſeperating his wounded Arme from his body, euen the ſame Arme wherewith he killed the King his Brother, which made him fall downe dead to the ground, whereupon <hi>Amadis</hi> called to him, ſaying. <hi>Abiſeos,</hi>

this is puniſhment in member, whereby thou didſt thruſt thy ſelfe into the Crowne, and now haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued death according to thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. Then hee turned about to helpe <hi>Agraies,</hi> but he met him with the head of <hi>Dariſon</hi> in his hand: whereat all the people gaue a great ſhoute, and humbled themſelues to <hi>Briolania</hi> as their lawfull Queen. This was the end of the wretched Father and his Sonnes, ſeruing at this day for an example to ſuch as ſhamefully vſurpe the right of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: which though they enioy for a ſmall ſeaſon, yet when the God of power letteth looſe his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows againſt them, they fall into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and deteſted ruine.

But when <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ſhould take leaue of his Lady, her griefe and teares vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, able to mooue ruth in a heart of flint, although <hi>Floreſtan</hi> aſſured her of his ſpeedy returne. Notwithſtanding all theſe mones, forward they ſet to the Realme of <hi>Sobradiſa: Floreſtan</hi> crauing a boon of his brother by the way, to wit: that he would not combate on the way for any thing which might happen, vntill he were able to hold out no longer. With much a doe he obtained his requeſt, &amp; ſo rode they on foure dayes together, not meeting with any aduenture wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the rehearſall: but toward Sun ſetting they met a knight hard by a Tower, who intreated them ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to lodge there that night, which gentle offer they accepted, and entring with the knight, they conferred on many matters till ſupper was ready. The knight was of comely ſtature, &amp; well ſpoken, but his countenance was ſo ſad &amp; melancholly, as <hi>Galaor</hi> began thus to queſtion with him. Me thinkes Sir you are not ſo merry as you ſhould be, but if wee may any way help your penſiueneſſe, tell vs, and you ſhall finde vs willing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it. I beleeue aſſuredly, quoth their hoſt, that like good knights you would doe as you ſay, but my ſadneſſe is cauſed through extream loue, a matter not to be reuealed, and therefore the rather to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. So ſate they downe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which beeing ended, <hi>Galaor,</hi> and his brother were condcted to their chamber, where they repoſed themſelues till the next morning: when mounting on horſe-backe, their hoſt would accompany them a little on the way, and calling for his Iennet, but putting on no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, hee rideth with them: this did hee to ſee what ſhould happen to them, becauſe in the way hee guided them, he hoped to ſee ſome proofe of their manhood, when if they were vanquiſhed or ſlaine, he might the more eaſily eſcape from them.</p>
                  <p>Not farre had they trauelled, but they came to a place called the fountaine of Oliues, becauſe in the midſt of the water grew three high Oliue trees. Heereby they eſpyed three beautifull Damoſels, and a Dwarffe ſitting aloft in one of the trees: whereupon <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them very curteouſly, as one not to learne his behauior toward Ladies, then one of the Damoſels requiting his ſalutation, ſayd. Sir knight, if heauen haue endued you with as great bounty as comely perfection, no doubt but you are ſufficiently enriched. Faire Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell anſwered <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> if my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance doth pleaſe you, my inward vertue you may try if you haue any need. You ſpeake ſo kindely, quoth ſhe, that I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently make proofe of your valour, to ſee if you can carry mee hence from this place. In ſooth Lady, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> if of your ſelfe you
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7179:130"/>
be willing to goe, I know no reaſon to the contrary why you ſhould not. Herewith he commanded the ſquire to ſet her on a palfray, which was tied (ready furniſhed) at one of the oliue trees: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dwarfe behelde it, hee cryed out aloude. Come forth ſir knight, come forth, for here is one will carry away your friend. Preſently came out of a val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley a knight brauely prauncing, &amp; well armed, who ſaid to <hi>Floreſtan.</hi> What moues you ſir to touch my Lady? I cannot think ſhe is yours, anſwered <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> ſeeing ſhee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth mee to cary her hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Albeit ſhee would, quoth the knight, yet I thinke it not at this time ſo conuenient, becauſe I haue defended her from better then you are. I know not how well you haue defended, replied <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> but ſhe ſhall goe with me if I can helpe it. By God ſir, anſwered the other, you muſt firſt talk with the knights of this valley, and feele how ſafely they can keepe ſuch as they loue. So placing their Lances in their reſts, they ran couragiouſly againſt each other, the knight breaking his ſtaffe: but <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ſmot his ſhield ſo ſtrongly againſt his helmet, as the lace brake, and his head was bare, but worſt of all, he fel ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily vpon his ſword, that with his weight brake in two pieces. <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> finiſhed his carrire, hauing his Launce whole and ſound, when turning againe to the knight, hee ſaw that he moued neither hand or foote, wherefore punching him with his Lance vpon the ſtomack, ſaid: Pillard, thou art dead, if thou yeeld not. The knight being reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his traunce, &amp; beholding the preſent danger of his life, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mercy: which <hi>Floreſtan</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo he would freely reſigne the Damoſell. She is at your pleaſure, replied the knight, but curſed bee the houre when firſt I ſaw her. For by her folleys ſhe hath oftentimes endangered my life, <hi>Floreſtan</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him, came to the Domoſell, ſaying: Faire Lady, now you are mine. You haue ſo nobly won me, quoth ſhe, as I remaine at your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. As they were departing thence, one of the other Damoſels thus ſpake: Alas ſir, will you ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſo good company? it is a yeere and more ſince wee haue liued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and we would be loth now to depart in this manner. If you pleaſe to accompany her, anſwered <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> I can be content to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you together: and more I hope you will not requeſt, becauſe I meane not to leaue my conqueſt. I thinke not my ſelfe ſo foule, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the other damoſel, but ſome good knight may enterpriſe as great an aduenture for me: mary it is to be doubted, whether ſuch hardineſſe remaine in you or no.

                     </gap> quoth <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> thinke you that feare can make me leaue yet I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you on my faith, but that I would not forcibly cary you away, you ſhould preſently goe with me: but if your will be ſo good, let my ſquire helpe you vp on your hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Which ſhe did, &amp; the dwarfe cryed againe as he did for the firſt, whereupon another knight came immediatly foorth, and after him a ſquire bearing two Launces, the knight vſing theſe words to <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan.</hi> You haue (ſir) already won one Lady, and (not content with her) you ſeeke for another: but now in one inſtant you muſt looſe them both, and your head I doubt to keepe them company, becauſe you beeing of no better race, are vnworthy a Lady of ſo high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Thou vaunteſt very much, anſwered <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> yet haue I two
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7179:131"/>
knights of my linage, whom thou, nor three ſuch as thou art, may bee thought worthy to ſerue. Thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations extend very far, ſayde the knight, yet am I to meddle with none but thee, who haſt got a Lady from him that could not defend her: but ſhe muſt be mine if I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer thee, elſe by vanquiſhing me, thou ſhalt be maiſter of them both together. Now thou ſpeakeſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, quoth <hi>Floreſtan:</hi> defend thy Lady well, or without doubt ſhee will fall to my ſhare. So giuing the ſpurres to their horſes, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this controuerſie to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lance, when though the Prince failed in the race, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brake his ſtaffe very manfully: yet (being angry at his miſ-hap) at the ſecond courſe he ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the knight ſo violently to the ground, as hee thought euery bone of him was broken in pieces. Thus was he ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed of the ſecond Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and very loth hee was to leaue the third there alone, but ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding their hoſt that conducted them thither, ſpake to him in this manner. My friend, I would aduiſe ye to bee gone, becauſe you know theſe two knights cannot reſiſt him will preſently come: then if you be taken, you are ſure to dy the death. Beleeue mee Lady, quoth hee, I meane now to ſee the end of all, for my horſe is quick of pace, and my tower ſtrong enough to defend me from him. Well, looke to your ſelues, ſaid the Damoſell, you bee but three, and one of you vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but if he were, it might not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile him. When <hi>Floreſtan</hi> heard how ſhee praiſed him that was to come, he was more deſirous to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her away then before, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee would haue a ſight of him, and therefore bad his Squire to ſet her on horſe-backe as he did the other, when the Dwarffe in the oliue tree deliuered theſe wordes. Beleeue me Sir knight, in an euill houre came this boldneſſe on you, for preſently commeth one who will reuenge his companions. Foorth of the valley came a knight in gilt armour, mounted on a luſty bay courſer, the man reſembling a Giant in proportion, and reputed to be of incredible ſtrength. After him followed two Squires armed, each of them carying a hatchet in his hand, and ſo ſoone as he came neere <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> he thus ſpake. Stay knight &amp; fly not, for by flight thou art not able to ſaue thy life, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it for thee to dye like a good knight then a coward, eſpecially when by cowardiſe thou canſt not eſcape. <hi>Floreſtan</hi> hearing ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces of death, contemning like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a man of no value, incenced with anger, hee returned this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. Monſter, Beaſt, Diuell, or whatſoeuer thou art, reaſon I ſee thou wanteſt: ſo little do I eſteeme thy prodigall words, that I thinke thou haſt no better weapons to fight withall. I greeue, ſaide the Knight, that I cannot haue my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Look to thine owne thou wert beſt, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> for I hope I am ſufficient to excuſe them, and bee their Lieutenant in this matter on thee. Thus ſundring themſelues, in rage and fury they met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the beating of their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hoous made the earth to groan and the breach of their Launces made a terrible noiſe: but the great knight loſt his ſtirrops, and had fallen to the ground, if by catching hold about his horſe necke hee had not eſcaped. As <hi>Floreſtan</hi> helde on
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7179:131"/>
his courſe, hee caught a hatchet from one of the ſquires, where with he ſmote him quite beſide his horſe: and by time he returned; the Knight had recouered his ſeate againe, and the hatchet which the other Squire held. Now begins a dreadfull combat betweene them, ſuch eruell ſtrokes being giuen at each other with their hatchets, as though their helmets were of right truſty ſteele, yet they cut and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled them very pittifully. Many times was <hi>Floreſtan</hi> enforced to ſtaggering, by the mighty blowes of his monſtrous enemy, yet at length the Prince ſmote at him ſo furiouſly as he was faine to lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vpon his horſe neck, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling his ſtroake betweene the helmet and the brigandine he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his head from his ſhoulders. Being thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queror of all the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mofells, and they not a little mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing at this ſtrange victory, the Knight who had beene their hoſt the night before, ſpake to <hi>Floreſtan.</hi> My Lord, this Damoſell haue I long time loued, and ſhe me with like affection, but for the ſpace of this yeare &amp; more, the great knight (whom laſt you ſlue) hath forcibly detained her yet beeing now reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by your worthy proweſſe, I beſeech ye Sir, I may enioy her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. If it be ſo as you ſay, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> my pains haue ſtood you in ſome ſteede at this time, but againſt her will, neither you or any other can get her from me. Alas my Lord, quoth the Damoſell, no one but he hath right to my loue, then ſunder not them that ſhould liue together. Nor will I ſaid <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> you are, Lady at your owne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and may depart with your friend when you pleaſe. They both required him with manifold thanks then taking leaue of <hi>Galaor</hi> &amp; <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan,</hi> the knight rides home ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with his new conquered La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The other two Damoſells deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Princes to accompany the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their Ants houſe which was not far off, <hi>Galaor</hi> queſtioning with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the way, why they were kept in ſuch ſort at the Fountaine, where-to one of the Damoſells thus repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Vnderſtand my Lord, that the great Knight who was ſhine in the combat, loued the Lady which your hoſt carried away with him, but ſhe deſpiſed him aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, fancying no other then him who now enioys her. But in reſpect this knight was ſo puiſſant, as none in this country durſt contend with him, he kept her violently whether ſhe would or no, yet offering her no iniury, becauſe he loued her decrely, and one day among other he thus ſpake to her: faire Miſtreſſe, to the end I may compaſſe your gentle affection, and be eſteemed of you the only knight in the world liſten what I will do for your ſake. There is a Knight named <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> accounted the onely man for valour this day liuing, who ſlew a Cozin of mine in the Court of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> a knight of great fame called <hi>Dardan</hi> the proud: him (for your ſake) will I ſeeke, and by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off his head, conuert all his glory to mine owne commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But till I compaſſe what I haue ſaid, theſe two Ladies (meaning vs) and theſe two knights of my linage ſhall attend on you, and each day conduct you to the fountaine of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liues, which is the only paſſage for knights errant through this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: if any dare be ſo bold to cary you thence, there ſhall you ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny braue combats, &amp; what the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of your loue can make me do, to cauſe the like opinion in you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, as your diuine prfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:7179:132"/>
haue wrought in me to you. Thus were wee taken and giuen to the two Knights who were firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, and with them we haue abode the ſpace of one whole yere, in which time many combats they fought for vs, yet neuer conquered till this preſent. In ſooth Lady, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> the knights intent was too high for him to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, becauſe he could not deale with <hi>Amadis,</hi> and eſcape the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune now fallen vpon him: but how was he named?

Eſpecially the eldeſt (named <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidon)</hi> who was ſo well brought vp and conditioned, that hee found not his equall in any vertuous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity wherein he exerciſed himſelfe. This <hi>Apolidon</hi> ſtudied all ſciences, wherein he profited ſo much, that hee was not onely counted one of the beſt knights in the world, but alſo ſurpaſſed all men of his time for wiſedome: excelling them in learning, as farre as the moone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the ſtarres in light, and chiefly in the art of Nigromancy, by the which he brought to paſſe many great matters, which ſeemed beyond the capacity of men. Now was the King (father of theſe two young Princes) moſt mighty in lands, and wealthy in treaſure: but very weake in body by reaſon of his age. Wherefore knowing the end of his daies to approach, he would before his death, make partition of all his goods vnto his children, becauſe no contention or debate ſhould happen betweene them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his deceaſe. And for that end he appointed the kingdome to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polidon,</hi> being his eldeſt ſonne and heire, the other he inueſted with all his riches, and moneable goods, among which there was many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent bookes, of ineſtimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. Yet the youngeſt nothing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this partition, beway led his eſtate vnto the King, beſeeching him moſt humbly to conſider, that his patrimony being ſo ſmall, hee was not onely left poore, but in a manner diſinherited. Then the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged father perceiuing the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of his ſonne (being the thing hee moſt feared) was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſorrowfull, but yet would he not alter that which hee had done, without the conſent of <hi>Apolidon:</hi> who beeing aduertifed thereof,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7179:137"/>
came vnto him, and in the preſence of his brother ſaide thus. It may pleaſe your Maieſtie, I heard with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few dayes that my brother is not content with that portion, which it hath pleaſed you to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point vnto him: and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I knowe how grieuous the ſame is vnto you, ſeeing the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue betwixt him and mee likely to be broken: I moſt humbly beſeech your highneſſe, to take all that againe which it hath pleaſed you to giue vnto mee, and diſpoſe therof as it ſhal ſeeme beſt to your owne minde, for I ſhall thinke my ſelfe thriſe fortunate, to doe any thing that may breede your ſoules felicity, and very well apaid, with that which to him was appointed.</p>
                  <p>When the King behelde the bounty of his ſonne <hi>Apolidon,</hi> and the obedience hee ſhewed vnto him, hee was therewithall ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and exceeding ioyfull, that his ſoule (knowing it, could not leaue his body in greater contentment) fled vp into heauen: leauing his two ſonnes in ſuch friendſhip as he deſired. Notwithſtanding, after the body was buried, and all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed funerall rights ended, <hi>Apolidon</hi> cauſed certaine ſhippes to he rigged and furniſhed for the ſea, wherein being embarked, with diuerſe Gentlemen of his friends, ſeeing the winde and weather fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour them, he commanded the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers to bee waied, and the ſailes to be let fall; the which were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently filled with ſo ſtiffe a gale, as in leſſe then one houre they were paſt the countrey of Greece. And yet <hi>Apolidon</hi> had not derter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to bond his courſe vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certaine coaſt: but following his fortune, driuen by the winde, he diſcouered the Countrey of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, whereunto approching, he lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a certaine port thereof.

And although that their loue was alike, yet was this faire Lady ſo ſtreightly looked vnto, that neither could her affection bee ſatisfied, nor the common deſire of them both bee performed. Wherefore one day conſulting more priuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then they euer yet before had done, loue wrought ſuch a conſent in them, as they agreede to depart vnto ſuch a place, where they might without controle, enioy the fulneſſe of their content<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo as what they ſecretly intended, they as ſuddenly executed.

Then by force of the winde, they were in few dayes driuen to arriue at the foote of the Firme-Iſland, which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7179:137"/>
was then inhabited by a mighty Giant, whereof <hi>Apolidon</hi> and thoſe in the ſhip were ignorant. Where-upon thinking they were in a place of ſafety, came on ſhoare, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ents and Pauilions were ſet vp, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they might refreſh them: for <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> (who was not vſed to trauaile by ſea) was as wearie as might be. But at that inſtant when they thought themſelues moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, the Giant which had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered them, took them ſo ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Apolidon</hi> had ſcant ſo much leiſure, as to arme himſelfe: where-with <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> was ſo amazed, that ſhe was ready to die for feare: for the Giant taking her by the hand, ſaid vnto <hi>Apolidon.</hi> Baſe ſlaue, although I am not accuſtomed to be kind vnto any, yet am I content for this once, to ſuffer thee to fight againſt me alone, on this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if thou be ouercome, this faire Lady ſhall be mine, and then afterwards I ſhall cauſe thee to bee hanged vpon the pole of this tent. When <hi>Apolidon</hi> heard that by figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with ſuch a monſter, he might both ſaue himſelfe &amp; his miſtreſſe: his hart was ſo great, as he thought it a very eaſie matter to ouercome him: and eſteemed himſelfe happy, that fortune had offered him ſo fit an occaſion, as to make known vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Grima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eſa</hi> how much was his courage, and how great was his Knight-hood. Wherefore with-out longer delay the combate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan betweene them, the which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted but a while, for the Giant was purſued ſo valiantly, as hee fell downe back-ward. Then <hi>Apolidon</hi> ſtreight ſtepped ouer him and cut off his head. Which the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Iſle vnderſtanding, they all came and offered them-ſelues vnto him; becheeching him to remaine with them, and to bee their Lord and protector. Vnto this their requeſt he condiſcended: wherefore they conducted him with great triumph to the cheefe Fortreſſes of the Countrey, all which he found ſo well fortified, and furniſhed, as from that time forward hee nothing feared the power of the Emperor, if he ſhold attempt war againſt him for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of his ſiſter. Afterwards by the perſwaſion of <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> he cauſed to be builded in that place, one of the faireſt places that was to be found in all the Iſles of the Oci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: the which he beautified ſo gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly, and furniſhed ſo righly, that the greateſt monarch of the earth would haue found it a very difficult matter to haue builded the like. But it chaunced that fifteene daies after his there arriuall, the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> (his vnckle) died without heirs of his body; by meanes whereof, they of the Countrey diſpatched Embaſſadors vnto <hi>Apolidon</hi> to beſeech him to take vpon him the Empire, the which hee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accepted, being (as moſt men are) neuer contented with their eſtate, but ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of change, eſpecially of a pettie Iſland, for an Empire. Yet <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> ſorrie to leaue ſo pleaſant an Iſland, did moſt inſtantly entreat her Lord, that before their departure, (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the pleaſure which they had enioyed in this Palace, the firſt witneſſe of the full fruition of their loues) hee would worke ſuch a meanes by his Art and great knowledge, that from thence forth, none might bee Lord thereof, except hee were as good a Knight as he, and as true in loue as hee was. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Madame, anſwered <hi>Apolidon,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:7179:138"/>
I will doe more for your loue then ſo: for not onely no man ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into this Pallace except he be ſuch a one as you haue ſayde, but further, no Lady, nor Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlewoman ſhall ſet her foote therein, vnleſſe ſhe be as faire, and excellent in all perfections as your ſelfe. Then at the entrie of an Orchard (planted with diuerſe ſorts of trees) he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a vault to bee made: ouer the which hee placed the image of a man made of copper, holding a horne, as though hee would winde it: and vpon the gate of this Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace he ſet vp his owne and <hi>Grima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſa</hi> her picture, ſo artificially wrought that they ſeemed verie liuely: right ouer againſt which, he planted an high ſtone of Iaſper, and about half a bow ſhoot off, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the garden hee ſet a piller of iron fiue cubits high.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things beeing in this ſort framed, hee asked <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> if ſhe knew what hee had done. No ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, anſwered ſhee. I will tell you then preſently ſayde <hi>Apolidon:</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſelfe Madame, that no man nor woman which hath falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their firſt loue, ſhall paſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this vault: for if they aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to enter the ſame, the image which you ſee, ſhall blowe ſuch a terrible blaſt, &amp; ſhall caſt through this horne, ſuch a flame, &amp; ſtench, that it ſhall be impoſſible for them to paſſe on further: moreouer, they ſhall bee caſt forth with ſuch force, that they ſhall bee throwne downe and remayne in a ſwound before the vault. But if it chance that any loyall louer, man, or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, doe aſſay this aduenture, the image ſhall ſound a tune ſo melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, as it ſhall greatly delight the hearers: &amp; there may ſuch faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full louers paſſe, without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pechment. Furthermore, they may beholde our portraytures, &amp; their own names writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this Iaſper, yet ſhall they not know by whom they were in grauen. For tryall whereof if it pleaſe you, wee will proue the ſame forthwith. Then hee tooke <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> by the hand, and paſſing vnder the arch, the Image of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per beganne to ſound marueilous ſweetly, but when they came to the Iaſper ſtone, they beheld their names newly ingrauen therein, which greatly pleaſed <hi>Grimaneſa.</hi> And to beholde what would be the ſucceſſe of ſuch as followed them, they called certaine Gentlemen, and Gentlewomen to make tryall of the aduenture: but as they thought to haue paſſed thorough the vault, the Image blew ſuch a hideous blaſt, and caſt forth fire, ſmoake and flame ſo horrible, that they all fell downe in a ſwound, &amp; were throwne foorth moſt rudely. Wherewith <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> began to laugh, knowing that they were in more dread then danger, than king <hi>Apolidon</hi> moſt heartily for that which hee had done for her ſake. But yet my Lord, ſayde ſhe, what ſhall become of this rich chamber, in which you and I haue enioyed ſuch great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment? You ſhall knowe by and by, ſaid hee. Then cauſed hee two other pillers to bee brought: one was of Marble, which hee had placed within fiue paces of the chamber: and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Braſſe, was ſet fiue paces before that. Afterwards he ſaid to <hi>Grimaneſa:</hi> Madame, henceforth there ſhall neither man nor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man enter into this chamber, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that hee who ſhall ſurpaſſe mee in proweſſe, and knight-hood, or ſhe which ſhall excell you in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bee firſt entered into the ſame: but when fortune ſhall bring hither thoſe which ſhall be worthy of a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7179:138"/>
place ſo excellent, all men after-wards, without any let may therein enter. Then he wrote vpon the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of Braſſe, theſe words: Euery knight which ſhall make proofe of this aduenture, ſhall paſſe ſome further then other, according as they excell each other in chiualrie &amp; courage. Vpon the Marble piller thus: Let no man aduenture to paſſe this piller to enter the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, except hee paſſe <hi>Apolidon</hi> in knighthood. And ouer the entry of the chamber: Hee which ſhall enter herein, ſhall exceed <hi>Apolidon</hi> in armes, and ſhall ſucceed him as Lord of this countrey.</p>
                  <p>Before any man could come neere the chamber, hee muſt of force touch the two pillers, &amp; there trie his manhood. He likewiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned that they ſhould bee diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med which hereafter ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to paſſe vnder the arch of faithfull louers, if they receiued the repulſe: and that all ſuch ſhould bee driuen forth of the Iſland, as falſe and diſloyall men: but ſuch as were faithfull, ſhould bee enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayned with all honour and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice that might be deuiſed. Such as aduentured to paſſe the pillers to enter the forbidden chamber, if they did not paſſe the Braſen pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, they ſhould bee vſed neither better nor worſe then thoſe which were falſe in loue. If by chance they went beyond it, becauſe there ſhould bee a difference betweene them and the others, their ſwordes onely ſhould bee taken from them. And if there came any better knight which attayned not vnto the Marble piller, hee ſhould loſe but his ſhield: yet if hee paſſed on further, and entered not the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, his ſpurres onely ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from his heeles.</p>
                  <p>And touching the Ladies and Gentlewomen, married or vnma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, which ſhould proue the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture of conſtant louers, if they were repulſed, hee willed that they ſhould be conſtrayned to tell their names, that they might be written vp at the entry of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>When the time is come (ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polidon)</hi> that this Iſle ſhall recouer ſuch a Lord as is promiſed vnto it, theſe enchantments ſhall no more be hurtfull vnto any, and the place ſhall be free for all men: but yet it ſhall not bee ſo for women, vntill the faireſt Lady ſhall firſt be entred into it, who ſhall free the paſſage for all others. Then did hee eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Gouernour to receiue the reuenue of the countrey, vntill he ſhould come that deſerued it. And ſhortly after, hauing taken order for all his affaires, his ſhips being ready, they imbarqued, and had ſo faire a winde, that within fewe dayes they arriued in <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> where they were moſt royally receiued.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe my meaning at this preſent is onely to continue the deeds of <hi>Amadis,</hi> I will leaue <hi>Apolidon</hi> to gouerne his Empire, to declare vnto you what happened vnto the ſame <hi>Amadis,</hi> and vnto them which followed him at his departure from the Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>When <hi>Amadis</hi> vnderſtood the determination of his Coſen, hee was deſirous to follow him, for he knew his loyalty to bee firme both in deed and thought, which by all likelihood did promiſe him the maiſtry of the adueneure, before all others. But yet hee diſſembled his intention, and ſayde vnto his brethren, My friends although we are not amourous, as is my Lord <hi>Agraies,</hi> yet me thinkes we ſhould for this once doe as hee doth, and keepe him companie. Let vs goe ſayd <hi>Galaor,</hi> and I hope that all will fall out as wee deſire, to our glory and our honour: heereupon they followed the Gentlewoman. Then <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> who had neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard what the Firme-Iſland was, being alone with <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſayde vnto him. My Lord, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue you know all the wonders of this place, whereunto wee are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereof I neuer heard any ſpeech, although I haue trauailed many farre countries. Truely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> that which I know, I learned of a young Prince, my very good friend, named <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Norwales,</hi> who hath prooued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrange aduentures, and chiefly theſe of the Firme-Iſland, which he could not atchieue, but was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to returne with ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. This Gentlewoman dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the place, of whom you may vnderſtand as much as you deſire to knowe. Wherefore <hi>Don Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> came vnto her, and intreated her very earneſtly, that ſeeing the lenght of their way miniſtered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occaſion of conference together, ſhee would bee pleaſed to recite vnto him, all that which ſhe knew of the Iſland. I will very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare vnto you (ſayde ſhee) that which I haue learned of ſuch, as by their owne reports were well acquainted with the place, and the wonders thereof. Then ſhee rehearſed the particularities of all that which hath beene before declared: whereat the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7179:140"/>
more they admired, the more were they encouraged to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the enterpriſe of thoſe ſtrange things, wherein ſo many valiant men had receiued the foyle. Thus together they rode ſo long, that night comming, they were in doubt to go aſtray, vntill the moon began to ſhine: and then they knew that they were in a great meddow, in which they beheld ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pauillions ſet vp, and people ſporting all about them. Then ſaid the Gentlewoman vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> Sir, becauſe I ſee my father, you may if it pleaſe you, come faire and ſoftly, and I will goe before to aduertiſe him of your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, that he may do you that honour as you deſerue. So ſaying, ſhee gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopped her horſe, vntill ſhee came vnto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ents, where ſhe alighted. Then ſhee tolde her father, how theſe foure knights had followed her, hauing a deſire to trie the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures of the FirmeIſland, which he vnderſtanding, came to meete them, and receiued them very courteouſly: afterwards hee led them vnto one of the Pauillions, where they reſted vntill their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was ready. When they were ſet downe, the gouerner of the Iſle diſcourſed vnto them the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſuch Knights and Ladyes, which had proued the arch of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all louers, and the other nouelties thereof, vntill it was time to goe to reſt. Whereupon they all with-drew themſelues, and when day appeared, they mounting all on horſe-back, rode ſo long, that they came to a place which was in breadth no more then a bow ſhoot of firme ground, and all the reſt was water. And they went on in this ſtraight, vntill they came into the entrie of the Iſland, the which was onely fiue leagues in breadth, and ſeuen in length. There might they ſee the ſumptuous Pallace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> whoſe gates were open: and as they drew neerer, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued more then an hundred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets or ſhields, placed in three rankes, the moſt parte leaning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt two poſtes, and tenne other nailed a little ouer them. But there were three which were very high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the reſt, faſtned vpon another poſt which ſtood forwarder then the firſt, yet did they likewiſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in height, for the higheſt was a faddom aboue the middle-moſt, and the middlemoſt was a cubit ouer the loweſt. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> demanded, why they were thus ranked. Truely, anſwered the gouernour, according to the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and knight-hood of thoſe which would haue entred the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden chamber, their ſhields are honoured: and theſe which you ſee neereſt the ground, belonged to ſuch Knights which could not come neere the braſen piller; but theſe tenne that are higher came vnto it, &amp; they which ought theſe two other ſhields, which you ſee ſeperated and placed aboue the reſt, haue done more: for they haue paſſed the piller, yet could they not come neere the other of marble, as the other hath done, whoſe ſhield is therfore placed aboue theſe two, which are ſo much eſteemed. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> approched more neere to ſee if he might know any of them, for there was none of them, but had written vpon them the names of ſuch as heretofore did owe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and he caſt his eye vpon the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermoſt of the three, which hung by themſelues ouer the other tenne: which had in a field <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> a Lyon <hi>Or,</hi> fanged and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For <hi>Quedragant</hi> behaued himſelfe ſo valiantly, that he came vnto the Marble piller, whereunto none other had before approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. He by chance paſſed by the Firme-Iſland, in ſeeking for <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> with an intent to fight with him, and to reuenge the death of King <hi>Abies</hi> his brother.</p>
                  <p>Much amazed was <hi>Amadis</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhields of ſo many good Knights, which had all fayled in their purpoſed enterpriſe, and hee greatly feared leaſt hee might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme as little as they. For this cauſe, hee and his company with-drew themſelues, to goe towarde the arch of loyall louers, the which was ſhewed vnto them. <hi>Agraies</hi> ſuddenly alighted, and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neere the forbidden place, hee with an indifferent high voice thus ſpake, Loue if euer I haue beene conſtant, let mee now be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. This ſayde, hee paſſed on, and entred vnder the arch. Then the copper Image began to ſound ſo ſweetely, as it greatly reioyced the hearers: and <hi>Agraies</hi> ſtayed not, but went on vntill hee came vnto the Pallace where the pictures of <hi>Apolidon</hi> and <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> were, which ſeemed vnto him, as if they had been aliue. And he came neer vnto the Iaſper piller, wherein he beheld two lines written. The firſt contayned <hi>Madanil</hi> ſonne to the Duke of <hi>Bargoine,</hi> hath paſſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the arch of loyall louers, and ended that aduenture.

                        </gap>le.</hi> When <hi>Amadis</hi> did ſee that his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen was entred without any let at all, hee ſayde vnto his brethren. Will not you proue the aduenture as hee hath done? No, anſwered they, for we are not ſo much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto this paſſion, that wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to make tryall of our loyalty. Seeing then that you bee twaine, keepe you one another company, and I will accompany Lord <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> if I can. Then he boldly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered vnder the arch, and as hee paſſed, the copper Image ſounded vpon his horne another ſound, far more melodious then hee yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had done. Moreouer, in ſtead of fire and ſtinking flame, that it caſt forth againſt the diſloyall lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, flowers and ſweete leaues came forth of his horne, in ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, that the place were all couered therewith. But for all this <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſtayed not, but paſſed on euen hard vnto the Images of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polidon</hi> and <hi>Grimaneſa,</hi> the which ſeemed vnto him ſo well formed, as they wanted nothing but ſpeech. When <hi>Agraies</hi> which was entered before, perceiued him, he came to him and ſayde, My Lord
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7179:141"/>
and Coſen, me thinkes we ſhould not hence-forth hide our loues from one another. But <hi>Amadis</hi> without any anſwere, tooke him by the hand, and walking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they beganne to diſcourſe of the excellency of the place. In the meane ſeaſon <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> diſpleaſed with ſtaying ſo long for them, did intreate <hi>Iſania</hi> (the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of the Iſle) to ſhew them vnto the forbidden chamber: the which he did.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ſayde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Galaor,</hi> my Lord, are you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to try your ſelfe? No, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered hee, for I neuer deſired to prooue ſuch enchantments. I pray you then ſayde <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> to ſport you whileſt I haue tryed this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture. Then commending him-ſelfe to God, with his ſhield vpon his arme, &amp; his ſword in his hand, hee marched right towardes the forbidden place. But he went not farre forward, when hee felt him-ſelfe layd at ſo ſore, and ſo often ouercharged with the ſtroakes of Launces and ſwords, as hee verily beleeued that no man was able long to ſuffer them: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bearing his head lowe (mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger all the reſiſtance) he marched forward, laying about him heere and there, but knewe not vpon whom. Yet he thought that which hee did hit, were ſo well armed, as his ſworde could in no ſort hurt them, and hee paſſed the piller of Braſſe, euen hard vnto the other of Marble, againſt the which hee fell downe, not being any longer able to ſtand vp: for hee felt him-ſelfe ſo wearie, and bruiſed with the forcible blowes which hee had ſuffered, that he thought he ſhould die. And in the ſame inſtant he was ſo rudely lifted forth of the place, that hee loſt all his vnderſtanding: wherewith <hi>Galaor</hi> was ſo diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that he thought himſelfe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of blame if he did not reuenge his wrong. And therefore hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke him to his armes, and ranne right vnto the forbidden chamber: yet his haſte was not ſo great, but that hee was as ſuddenly reſiſted &amp; ſmitten, and ſo violently layde a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as very hardly hee came vnto the Marble piller, againſt the which hee leaned, thinking to take breath. Notwithſtanding the ſtroakes which on all partes lighted vpon him, were ſo many and ſo weighty, that hee was inflamed with rage in ſuch ſort as hee went on ſomewhat further, hoping yet to withſtand them. Then did he imagine his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to bee ſo many, that for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one blowe hee had before, he now thought that hee receiued twaine, ſo as his ſtrength quite fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and hee fell downe on the ground a great deale more weake then <hi>Floreſtan</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>All this while <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaies</hi> beholding the pleaſantneſſe of the place wherein they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, perceiued a new writing in the Iaſper piller, which contained: This is <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant louer, ſonne to King <hi>Perion.</hi> At the ſame inſtant was <hi>Galaor</hi> throwne foorth from the pillars, wherewith the Dwarffe began to cry: Out alas, my Lord <hi>Galaor</hi> is dead. This voyce was heard of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> and <hi>Agraies,</hi> who preſently came forth to ſee what the matter was, and they asked the Dwarffe what moued him to cry ſo loud. My Lord anſwered hee, I beleeue your two brethren are dead, in prouing the aduenture of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden chamber: for they haue beene ſo rudely repulſed, as ſee where they lie without moouing hand or foot.</p>

Truſt mee ſaide <hi>Amadis</hi> worſe could not haue happened to thee. Then he went vnto them, and hee found them ſo ſorely bruiſed, that they lay ſpeechleſſe. But <hi>Agraies</hi> (thinking becauſe fortune had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured him vnder the arch of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all louers, that ſhee would bee as fauourable vnto him againſt the perill of the chamber) without ſtaying to beholde his Coſens any longer, hauing his ſhield vpon his arme, and his ſworde naked in his hand, bearing his head lowe, hee ran right to the braſen piller, yet had hee not marched farre beyond it, when hee felt ſo many blowes, that hardly could hee reſiſt them. But his heart was ſo great, as mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger all lets, he paſſed euen vnto the marble piller, and there was hee conſtrained to ſtay, hauing no power at all to ſtand any longer v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his feet, being ſo aſtonied that hee loſt his remembrance, and hee was as rudely caſt out as his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens had beene before, the which <hi>Amadis</hi> perceiuing, beeing much diſpleaſed, hee began to curſe the houre of that their fond enterpriſe: and approaching vnto <hi>Galaor,</hi> who was now come to himſelfe, he ſaid. In troth brother I perceiue I muſt of force followe, though I ſhould die therein. Ah my Lord, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Galaor,</hi> it ſhould ſuffice you to take warning by our example, I beſeech you flie ſuch diueliſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries, for nothing but miſchiefe can come from them. Come what will, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> accurſed may I be, if I faint in the matter. Then drawing his ſword, hee well coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him with his ſhield, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing firſt made his deuout prayers vnto God, hee cryed, O my deare Lady <hi>Oriana,</hi> from you onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth all the ſtrength and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage that euer I had: I beſeech you now not to forget him, who ſo conſtantly craueth your ayde and good aſſiſtance. Which ſayd, hee ranne ſo lightly towards the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as in ſpight of all impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hee came without taking breath, euen vnto the firſt piller, althought hee felt ſo many ſtrokes light vpon him, that hee did thinke hee fought with more then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand knights together: yet his courage ſo much increaſed with the onely remembrance of <hi>Oriana,</hi> that there were neuer any knight before which could come neere him. Then was there heard the voyces of an infinite number, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: If this knight do not end this aduenture, neuer may any knight performe the ſame. But for all theſe things hee left not to purſue his fortune, for the further he went, the more encreaſed his deſire to approach the chamber: ſo as not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the force of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, or inuiſible company which gaue him many ſore and heauy ſtrokes, hee gained the entry of the chamber, from whence he beheld a hand and an arme couered with green woſted to come forth, which drew him in. And preſently there was heard another voyce, which ſayde: Welcome is the gentle knight that exceedeth him in armes, which eſtabliſhed ſo many maruailes in this place, who in his time was ſecond to none, but this ſurpaſſeth him, and therefore the ſigniory of this Iſland of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to him, hauing aboue all other deſerued it. He which had ſeene this hand, would haue iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it to haue beene the hand of a very ancient ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it was ſo withered: the which va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed away ſo ſoon as <hi>Amadis</hi> was entred into the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where he felt himſelfe ſo freſh, and in ſo good eſtate, as if he had
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7179:142"/>
receiued neither blow nor trauell in comming thither. Wherefore hee tooke his ſhield from his neck, ſheathed his ſword, and to <hi>Oriana</hi> he aſcribed the glory, for the great honour which he had gotten: for hee imagined that all his ſtrength proceeded onely from her, and no other. The moſt part of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants in the Iſle, with many other ſtrangers had ſeene the proweſſe he had ſhowne, and how the hand brought him into the chamber: eſpecially hauing heard by the words of the voyce, the ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the countrey was attributed to him, for which cauſe they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced very greatly. But none were ſo ioyfull as <hi>Galaor</hi> and his fellows, who in ſtead of emulation, (where-with they might wrongfully haue beene ſuſpected) they were all ſo glad of the good and honour of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> as if the like had chanced particularly to euery one of them: and they cauſed themſelues to bee carried to him in the chamber, where they were thoroughly and preſently healed by the vertue of the place. Thither likewiſe came <hi>Iſania</hi> Gouernour of the countrey, accompanied with many of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, who all did their duty vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> as to their new Lord, vnder whom they hoped not onely to liue in peace and reſt, but alſo hereafter to ſtretch their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons euen ouer their bordering neighbours and further. Then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one might view the rare deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this palace: amongſt which there was a wardrobe (whether <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polidon</hi> &amp; his Lady did moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly withdrawe themſelues) ſo beautifull and ſumptuous, as it was not onely impoſſible to make the like, but alſo it was thought very ſtrange and wonderfull, how any man might imagine that hee could build ſo rare a peece of worke? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>You haue heard in the firſt booke of <hi>Amadis,</hi> in what anguiſh the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> was, for the falſe report of <hi>Ardan</hi> the Dwarffe, at ſuch time as hee returned backe from his maiſter, to fetch the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſword, which <hi>Gandalin</hi> had forgotten behinde him at his departure from the Court: and how ſhe ſoſtered vp in her minde the hate, which ſhe had conceiued againſt <hi>Amadis,</hi> not being able to accept any councell either from <hi>Mabila</hi> or the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> wrongfully ſuſpected him of falſhood, who thought on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but only how he might ſerue and honour her with all faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

And hereupon ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee was abſent, and that ſhee could not declare vnto him by word of mouth, the anguiſh of her ſoule, ſhee determined to let him vnderſtand it by writing.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen <hi>Durin</hi> had at large vnderſtood the will of the Princeſſe, he mounted on horſe backe, and haſted him ſo well that the tenth day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hee arriued in the great City of <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> where hee found the new Queene <hi>Briolania,</hi> whom hee thought to be the faireſt Lady that euer he had ſeene, except the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Oriana.</hi> Then did he tell her how he was come to ſeek <hi>Amadis,</hi> but ſhee tolde him, that now two whole dayes were paſſed ſince hee and his fellowes were departed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> ſince which time, ſhe heard that they had taken their way vnto the Firme-Iſland. Whereupon <hi>Durin</hi> without any longer ſtay, tooke leaue of her, and rode ſo long, that he arriued in the Iſland the ſame houre that <hi>Amadis</hi> entred vnder the arch of Loyall louers, where hee beheld how the Image had done more for him, then for any other knight that euer entered the ſame before, as it was tolde him. Now as <hi>Amadis</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Agraies</hi> returned to the ſuccour of his brethren, <hi>Durin</hi> thought to haue ſpoken with him, but <hi>Gandalin</hi> entreated him to ſtay vntill he had tred the perill of the forbiden chamber, beeing aſſured that he brought Letters to him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Oriana,</hi> the which perchance might haue been a meane (as he thought) to cauſe him either to forſlow or to faile in the achieuing of ſo great an enterpriſe: for <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Princeſſe, as hee would not only haue left off conqueſt of the Firme-Iſland, but alſo of the whole world beſide, if ſhe had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

finiſhed al the ſtrange aduentures, and the inhabitants of the Iſle had receiued him for their Lord, <hi>Durin</hi> came before him. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, what newes was in the Court of King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> My Lord, anſwered <hi>Durin,</hi> I left it euen in the ſame eſtate that it was in at your departure. And as he would haue proceeded in his ſpeech, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> tooke him by the hand, and went with him alone into a very pleaſant Orchard, where they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked together: then he demanded how he came to the Firme-Iſland. My Lord, ſaid he, my Lady <hi>Oriana</hi> ſent me vnto you, for ſuch affaires as in this letter you ſhal vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, the which he gaue vnto him. <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> tooke it, and without changing his cheere, he turned his face from <hi>Durin,</hi> becauſe hee ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde his colour alter, for his heart began to leap with great ioy, ſo as he knew not wel how to ſet his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. But this ſudden mutation was as ſoone changed into a great deſpare, becauſe, that reading theſe rigorous lines, which pronounced his baniſhment, it ſtroke ſo great ſorrow to his heart, as hee was no longer able to diſſemble his griefe, but burſt out into ſuch vehement weeping, that hee was all drowned in teares. Then <hi>Durin</hi> repented that euer hee was the bringer of ſuch heauie letters, for although the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts thereof were vnknown vnto him, yet becauſe he knew not how to remedy it, hee durſt not come neere <hi>Amadis,</hi> who was ſo confounded, as hee fell proſtrate on the ground, and in falling, the letters which hee helde, did fall foorth of his hand. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he preſently tooke them vp, and began to reade them againe: for the beginning had ſo greatly troubled him, that he had not yet ſeene the end.

Where-with <hi>Durin</hi> was greatly amazed, &amp; ran ſpeedily to helpe him, but hee found him to moue no more then a dead man. Wherefore fearing ſome greate inconuenience, hee thought to haue called <hi>Galaor,</hi> or ſome other, yet fearing that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might be blamed, he ſtaed, &amp; comming vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> lifted him vp, who cryed. Oh heauens, why do you thus ſuffer mee to die, and haue not deſerued it? Alas Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, what recompence dooſt thou offer thoſe that neuer offended thee, now I ſee my ſelfe forſaken of her, for whoſe ſake I would rather ſuffer a thouſand deathes, then one of her commandements by mee ſhould be diſobeied. Then pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looking vpon the letter, which he had in his hand, he ſayde: Ah happy letter, becauſe thou wert written by the excellen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So hee put it in his boſome, and asked <hi>Durin</hi> if hee had ought elſe to ſay? No, anſwered he. Well then, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> thou ſhalt preſently returne with my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. In good ſooth my Lord, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Durin,</hi> ſhee hath expreſly forbidden me to receiue any. And what, did not <hi>Mabila</hi> nor thy ſiſter wil thee to ſay any thing to me? No my Lord, anſwered he, for they

knew not of my departure, becauſe my Lady ſtrictly charged mee to acquaint no body therewith. Ah God, ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> I ſee well now, that my miſery is voyd of remedy. Then he roſe vp and went to a riuer which paſſed along by the garden, where hee waſhed his eyes, which done, he willed <hi>Durin</hi> to call <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> and that hee ſhould come back againe with him alone, which hee did: but at their returne they found him in a ſwound againe, yet recouering incontinent, and ſeeing <hi>Gandalin,</hi> he ſaid. Friend I am vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, therefore go ſeeke out <hi>Iſania</hi> the Gouernour of this Iſle &amp; bring him hither alone. Then <hi>Gandalin</hi> ran for him and ſtaied not long vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>till they returned together: who being come, <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaid vnto him, <hi>Iſania</hi> you know the oath you haue ſworne vnto me, &amp; the duty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you are vnto mee bound, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, I pray you yet to promiſe me as you are true knight, to keep ſecret whatſoeuer you ſhal ſee me doe, vntill to morrow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after my brethren haue heard diuine ſeruice, and then ſecretly goe thou and cauſe the gate of this Caſtle to be opened, which being done, let <hi>Ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dalin</hi> bring thither my horſe &amp; armour, but take heed that none perceiue it, and I will follow ſtraight after thee: they were no ſooner departed from him, but he began to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber a dream which he had the night before, wherein he thought that being armed, and ſet vpon his horſe hee was on the higheſt part of a peece of land en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed with diuerſe ſorts of trees, and that round about him were many perſons making the greateſt ioy in the world, then one of them preſented him with a box, ſaying. Sir taſte of that which is herein: which he did, and hee thought hee did eate of a moſt bitter meat. And as hee caſt it from him, the raines of his horſe did breake, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the horſe ran vp and downe ſo that he was not in any ſort able for to ſtay him. When he ſaw he was ſo farre from this merry company, he looked backe, and hee thought that hee beheld their great mirth changed into ſuch exceeding mone, as it greatly pitttied him, &amp; willingly would he haue retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned backe to aſſawage their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, if hee could haue maſtered his horſe, who at that inſtant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a tuft of trees, where hee found a rocke enuironed with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, againſt the which the horſe ſtayed. Then hee alighted for the great deſire he had to reſt him, and vnarmed himſelfe: herewithall he beheld a very aged man clothed with a religious habit, who tooke him by the hand as if he had pittied his trauaile, &amp; ſpake to him certain words in a ſtrange language which he did not vnderſtand: &amp; being in this trouble he awaked. Vpon this dreame <hi>Amadis</hi> muſed a great while, thinking that oftentimes they foreſhow ſome thing that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, becauſe he did ſee part of that which hee had dreamed to fall out. Thus hee came to the gate where <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Iſania</hi> ſtayed his with furniture, &amp; there armed himſelfe: afterwards he mounted vpon his horſe, keeping neither way nor path vntill he came neere vnt an Hermitage, then he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>Iſania</hi> what place that was: My Lord anſwered hee, this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> wherein oftentimes are diuerſe ſtrange miracles wrought. For which cauſe <hi>Amadis</hi> allighted from his horſe, entred into the Church, and kneeling downe with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, hee made his prayers to

God. The which being ended, hee roſe vp, &amp; called <hi>Gandalin</hi> to him, whom he held a long time embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in his armes, not being able to ſpeake one word, yet in the end he thus ſaid vnto him. My deere <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> thou and I haue beene foſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp with one milke, and alwaies brought vp together, and I neuer felt any paine or ſorrow, wherein thou haſt not had thy part: Thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tok me vp in the ſea, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was yet but a ſmall thing, beeing but newly borne the very night before, afterward he cauſed thy mother to cheriſh mee as tenderly as if I had their deerieſt childe. Now haue I oftentimes tried thy loyalty, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very wel what ſeruice thou haſt done for me, the which I did hope in time with the fauour of God to haue recompenſed, but this great miſ-fortune is fallen vpon me, the which I feele more ſharpe and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell then death it ſelfe, eſpecially ſeeing I am conſtrained to forſake thee, hauing no other thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon thee, but the Iſle which I haue newly conquered, which I do giue thee, commanding <hi>Iſania,</hi> with my other ſubiects (vpon that faith and homage which they haue ſworne vnto me) to receiue thee as their Lord, ſo ſoone as they ſhall be aſſured of my death. Yet is it my wil that thy father and mother ſhal enioy the ſame, during their liues, and afterwards it ſhall remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee: which is in recompence of the good I haue receiued of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom I thought to haue better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, according to their deſerts and my deſire. And as for you, Lord <hi>Iſania,</hi> I pray you that of the fruits and reuenues of this Iſle, which of long time you haue had in your keeping, you ſhould build here in this place a Moneſtarie, in the honor of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and to endow it with ſo much liuing, as thirtie religious men may hence-forth liue vpon the ſame.

Then hee got vpon his horſe, ſet ſpurres to his ſides, and galloped from them, remembring not at his departure to take either Launce, ſhield, or helmet with him. Thus he entred into a deſert place at the foot of a mountaine, taking no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way but whither his horſe would carry him, and ſo long hee rode vntill the moſt parte of the night was now ſpent, when the horſe entred into a little brook en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed with many trees, where he would haue drunken.

their horſes, hee began to neigh, whereby <hi>Gandalin</hi> knew his Maſter was not farre off, wherefore the more ſecretly to behold his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, hee allighted, comming ſo neere vnto him as he might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily behold where he ſlept hard by the riuer ſide: whereupon he ſtood cloſe, watching when he ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, &amp; he had not ſtained long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſlumber left him. Then he ſuddenly ſtarted vp as if hee had been frighted. At that inſtant was the Moon withdrawne by the daies approach, yet ſate hee ſtill on the graſſe, beginning his moane in a moſt ſtrange and pittifull manner, and bitterly weaping, he burſt out into theſe words. Alas fortune too inconſtant &amp; fickle, why haſt thou firſt aduanced mee, and afterwards ouerthrowne me. Now I well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, thou canſt doe more hurt in one houre, then thou wilt do good in a thouſand yeares, for if hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou haſte giuen me any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or ioy, thou haſt now in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cruelly robbed me of all, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing me in bitter torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts far worſe then death: and ſeeing thou waſt minded ſo to ſerue mee, why haſt thou not at the leaſt made the one equal with the other? becauſe thou knoweſt that if heeretofore thou didſt beſtow vpon me any content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet was it euermore mingled with great ſorrowe. In like ſort ſhouldſt thou reſerue for me ſome ſparke of hope, with this cruelty wherewith thou now tormenteſt me, executing vpon me an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible thing, in the thought of thoſe whom thou fauoureſt: who becauſe they feele not this miſchiefe, doe thinke thoſe riches, glories, and honours which vnto them thou lendeſt, to bee euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. But they forget, that beſides the troubleſom trauels which their bodies doe ſuffer for the keeping thereof, how their ſoules are in danger to periſh therefore. For by thy flatteries &amp; wanton intiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, thou vtterly ouerthroweſt them, &amp; in the end compelleſt them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the labytinth of all deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from whence they are neuer able to depart. And quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are thy aduerſities, for ſo much as if a man doe reſiſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> patiently, flying greedy couetouſnes, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate ambition, he is lifted out of this vilde place into perpetuall glory. Notwithſtanding I beeing moſt vnfortunate, could not chuſe this good, ſeeing that if all the world were mine, and ſhould bee taken from me by thee, yet hauing only the good grace of my Miſtris, it ſhould be ſufficient to make me as mighty as the greateſt monark, the which I alſo lacking, how is it poſſible for me in any ſort to liue? Therefore in fauour and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of my loyalty, I beſeech thee not to giue mee a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death: but if thou art appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ende my dayes, doe it with-out delay, taking compaſſion of him, whoſe longer life thou art ignorant how irkeſome it is. This ſayd, hee fell downe backward vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the graſſe, and was as ſilent as if he had beene in a ſwound. Then within a while after hee cryed, Ah louely <hi>Oriana,</hi> you haue wounded me deadly, in baniſhing me diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curteouſly, for I will neuer tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, what danger ſoeuer may happen mee, ſeeing that if therein I failed, my life alſo were thereby finiſhed: notwithſtanding for as much as I wrongfully receiue my death, the more extream is my dolor. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that with my end you ſhall reſt ſatisfied, I neuer eſteemed my life at ſo high a price, but I wold, if it were
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7179:146"/>
poſſible, change it into a thouſand deaths; to afford you neuer ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pleaſure. In like ſort ſince it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you to execute your anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, I am very well content, if for my affliction you may hence-forth liue at your eaſe, for whether ſoeuer my Soule flyeth, it ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue moſt quiet when it ſhal know that you remaine contented. And vntill mine innocencie ſhall bee known vnto you, I will endeauor to finiſh the reſt of my ſorrowfull daies in all bitterneſſe and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and being dead, my ſpirit ſhal lament the griefe which wil happen vnto you for the wrong which you haue done to me, ſpecialy wanting power to ſuccour you. O king <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> my Lord and father, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle occaſion ſhall you haue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile my death, when you ſhall neither know the ſame nor the cauſe thereof? But becauſe that knowing the ſame, it would bee to you a griefe intollerable, and yet it could be no mittigation of my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I pray, that my misfortune may to you neuer be manifeſt, leaſt the ſame ſhould abridge the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of your dayes, which yet are not determined. Then after a ſmall pauſe he cryed, O my ſecond father <hi>Galuanes,</hi> truely I do greatly grieue that my aduerſe Fortune doth not permit me to diſcharge that great bond in which to you I am bound, for if my father gaue me life, you preſerued the ſame, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering me from the danger of the Sea, being launched forth into his mercileſſe waues, euen when I had but newly left my mothers womb, and afterwardes I was by you as carefully cheriſhed, as if I had beene your deereſt childe. I am aſſured good King <hi>Arban</hi> that you will greatly bewaile my ſorrowfull end, yet valiant <hi>Angriotta d Eſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaux, Guillan,</hi> and a number of my other friends, ſhall aſſiſt you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone his death, who euer loued and held you deere. Ah good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin <hi>Mabila,</hi> what haue I deſerued of you, or of the Damoſel of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> that by you I am abandoned when I haue moſt neede of your ayde? Haue you ſo many times preſerued my life, &amp; doe you now (without deſert) make me pay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute for my receiued pleaſure, in conſenting to my miſerable death? Beleeue mee, if need were, deare friends, for your ſakes would I bee ſacrificed: and yet you make no conſcience to forſake mee, which maketh mee verily to beleeue, that you haue denied mee your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, heauen and earth haue deſired my confuſion, which ſhall the leſſe grieue me in that I ſee no remedy. <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Durin</hi> hearing theſe lamentations of <hi>Amadis,</hi> they were ſo much agrieued therewith, that they wept as bitterly as hee, yet durſt they not ſhew themſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee had ſo ſtraitly charged them not to follow him.

Hauing ended his ſong hee alighted vnder a tuſted tree planted by the high way ſide, thinking there to paſſe the reſt of the night: but worſe happened to him then he hoped, for <hi>Gandalin</hi> which had heard what hee ſayde of <hi>Oriana,</hi> (doubting that <hi>Amadis</hi> had not marked it, becauſe his minde was otherwiſe occupied) ſayde vnto <hi>Durin,</hi> It were beſt for mee to goe to my Maſter to know what hee intendeth to doe. Then came hee forth of the buſh where he was hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, &amp; beheld <hi>Amadis</hi> that ſought for his horſe to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, who as he looked here &amp; there he eſpied <hi>Gandalin:</hi> When not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him at the firſt, he cryed. Who art thou that commeſt to ſurpriſe me? ſpeake and hide thy ſelfe no longer. My Lord, anſwered he, I an <hi>Gandalin,</hi> who will helpe you to finde your horſe, if ſo it pleaſe you. When <hi>Amadis</hi> heard this, Ah ſaid hee, how druſt you perſume to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, hauing ſo expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>you? beleeue mee thou haſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed mee, let mee ſee thee no more but depart, or elſe be ſure thou ſhalt die. My Lord, anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> mee thinkes you ſhould forget this manner of behauiour, and bethinke you how to reuenge the fooliſh ſpeeches which euen now were vttered by a knight, who is not yet far from you, for they are greatly to your diſaduantage. This ſayde <hi>Gandalin</hi> to pacifie his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure towardes him, that hee might bee the more incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other. I did heare him as well as you (ſayd he) and therefore am I content to ſeeke reſt elſe-where, and to depart from hence where all misfortune doth follow me. What ſayd <hi>Gandalin,</hi> is this all that you are determined to doe? What wouldſt thou more? ſaid he. That you fight with him anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> to make him confeſſe his preſumption. I beleeue ſayd hee thou wouldeſt ſay otherwiſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou knoweſt very well that I neither haue ſpirit, heart, not any force, hauing loſt all in loſing her who gaue me life, ſo as now I am no better then a dead man, neither is there in Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> any knight ſo cowardly, that could not eaſily ouercome mee if I ſhould combate with him, ſo hapleſſe and hopeleſſe am I. Truſt me anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> you are in a great errour thus to ſuffer your heart to faint &amp; to let your courage faile, euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhould moſt ſerue you to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance the honour of her, who ſo neerely toucheth you. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port will <hi>Durin</hi> make hereof thinke you, who hath heard and ſeene all, and is greatly abſhed, that now you behaue your ſelfe no better. How (ſayd <hi>Amadis)</hi> is <hi>Durin</hi> here? I truely ſayd <hi>Gandalin,</hi> wee came both together: and I beleeue hee followeth you thus, to declare your manner of behauiour vnto her that ſent him vnto you. Get thee gone ſayd <hi>Amadis,</hi> thou vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt mee too much. Yet when hee thought that <hi>Durin</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to <hi>Oriana,</hi> his heart was ſo inflamed, that hee called for his armes, and mounting on his horſe he went toward the knight, whom hee found layd vnder the tree, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his horſe by the bridle. Then <hi>Amadis,</hi> in a great rage ſayde vnto him, Sir knight who ſo greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolleſt thy fortune in loue, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that againſt all right thou haſt receined that good that loue hath doue for thee (if good it may be tearmed) and that thou neuer deſeruedſt it, the which I wil proue with the loſſe of thy head. What art thou anſwered the other, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7179:147"/>
ſpeakeſt ſo audaciouſly? doſt thou think that I am fauoured of the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Lady in the worlde for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe but onely for my valour and high knighthood? wherewith I will make thee preſently confeſſe that loue hath reaſon to fauour me, and that it is not for thee to ſpeake thereof. It is but thy opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſayde <hi>Amadis:</hi> but thou muſt knowe that in deſpight of thee, I am hee who hath leaſt occaſion to praiſe loue, becauſe hee hath ſo vildely deceiued me, that I wil ne-uer dayes in my life put any truſt in him, knowing how falſely and treacherouſly he commonly vſeth thoſe that moſt faithfully do ſerue him. And becauſe I haue ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prooued it, I will maintaine that he can neuer be ſo faithfull, as I haue found him falſe. That it is ſo, let vs ſee whether hee hath gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more in thee then he hath loſt in me. Then the knight mounted on his horſe, and beeing ready to fight, he anſwered, Vnhappy knight depriued of all good, and baniſht iuſtly from loue, beeing vnworthy of his fauor, get thee from my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, for I ſhould commit a moſt horrible fact, to lay my hands vpon ſuch a vild &amp; miſerable fellow. So ſaying, he turned his horſe to haue fled away, if <hi>Amadis</hi> had not ſtaied him in calling him. Villaine, wilt thou then defend thy loue which ſo highly thou priſeſt onely with thy countenance, and ſo get thee gone becauſe thou wouldeſt fly the combat. Truſt me anſwered the other thou art in a right opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for it is true that I haue no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to proue my ſelfe againſt a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſo ſmall deſert, but ſeeing thou wouldeſt that I ſhould breake thy head, I am content, and if thy heart will ſerue, defend it if thou canſt. Herewithall they ran one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other with ſuch force, as their Lances flew to ſhiuers, pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their ſhields quite thorough, neuertheleſſe their armour being good &amp; ſtrong ſtaied the ſtroke, yet the knight fell to the ground car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the raines of his horſe with him, wherefore he roſe again light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The which <hi>Amadis</hi> beholding, he ſaid vnto him, Truely knight if the right which you pretend in ſo faire a friend bee not better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with your ſword then it hath beene with your ſtaffe, Loue hath made but a bad choyce of you for a valiant champion, &amp; your Lady a far worſer match in lighting vpon ſuch a carpet knight. He made no account at all of theſe reproaches, but boldly drew out his ſword, and comming neere to <hi>Amadis</hi> laid at him ſo luſtily, that hee had beene wounded if with his ſhield hee had not well warded himſelfe, wherein his ſword was ſo farre entred, that he could not pul it forth again, but was forced to let go his holde, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it ſticking faſt in the ſhield of <hi>Amadis.</hi> Who lifted himſelfe vp in his ſtirrops hitting him ſo ſound a blow vpon his head-peece, that it pearced euen vnto the quick: &amp; the blow gliding downe, it lighted vpon his horſe neck, wounded him to the death, falling downe in the place and his maſter vnder him all aſtonied. But <hi>Amadis</hi> ſeeing him ariſe ſaid vnto him, Gentle lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, I am of the minde that <hi>Cupid</hi> henceforth ſhould erect a trophie for the high proweſſe which you haue ſhewed in his ſeruice: &amp; that as long as you liue you ſhould not ceaſe to ſing his praiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Salute from me the Princeſſe <hi>Mabila,</hi> and thy good ſiſter, the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> vnto whom thou mayſt declare my cruel death, which I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer with as great wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as euer any knight ſuffered.

hane heard that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> hath a daughter eſteemed the faireſt Princeſſe in the worlde, but for the loue of you I will goe into Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> there to mainteine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all men, that her beauty is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable to yours: the which I alone will prooue in combate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt two of the beſt knights that dare ſay the contrary: whom if I cannot ouercome, I will that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> doe cauſe my head to bee cut off. In good faith my Lord, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Queene, I am of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion: for if the Princeſſe haue any beauty in her, it nothing impaireth that which God hath beſtowed vpon mee, if any beauty there bee: and me thinks that you haue other means more fit to make known your proweſſe in all places. Hap what may hap anſwered hee, I will doe it for your loue, to the end that euery one may knowe that as you are the faireſt Lady in the world, ſo you are beloued of the valianteſt Knight aliue. Hereupon continuing in this minde, within a while after hee tooke leaue of the Queene, and paſſed into Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> accompanied onely with two Eſquires. Then hee enquired where he might find King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> vnto whoſe Court he ſhortly after came: and becauſe hee was more richly armed then wandering knights were accuſtomed to bee, the King thought him to be ſome great perſonage: For this cauſe hee receiued him moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, appointing him into a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to ſhift himſelfe. When he was vnarmed hee returned to the King who ſtayed for him, marching with ſuch grauity, as thoſe that beheld (ſeeing his comely ſtature) iudged him to bee of great courage. But the King tooke him by the hand, and conferring together hee ſayde vnto him, gentle friend, I pray you thinke it not ſtrange, if I deſire to know who you are, becauſe I may the more honor you in my Court. It may pleaſe your Maieſty, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Patin,</hi> I am not come into this countrey, to hide mee, but rather to make my ſelfe knowne as well vnto your Highneſſe as vnto all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: I am that <hi>Patin</hi> brother to the Emperour which humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeecheth you to enquire no further of my affaires, vntill I haue ſeen my Lady <hi>Oriana</hi> your daughter. When the King heard that, he embraced him, and in excuſing his ignorance he ſayd to him. My good Coſen, I am maruailous glad of the honour that you haue done me, In co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thus to viſit me in my owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, aſſuring you that ſince you are deſirous to ſee my daughter, ſhe ſhall not onely be ſhewed vnto you, but likewiſe the Queene, and all her trayne. And ſo long they continued their talke, vntill they had couered for ſupper. Then the King cauſed him to ſit next vnto him, where hee found himſelfe compaſſed with ſo great a number of knights, as hee much marualled thereat: and began to deſpiſe the Court of the Emperour his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as alſo of all other Princes in reſpect of this which hee ſaw. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the tables were taken vp, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time to goe to reſt, the King co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded <hi>Don Grumedan</hi> to bring <hi>Patin</hi> to his lodging and to ſhew him all the honor and good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment hee could. So for that night they departed, vntill the next morning that hee came and found the King hearing diuine ſeruice, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the which hee was conducted to the Ladies, who receiued him curteouſly: for at his comming the Queen took him by the hand, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſit betweene her, &amp; her
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7179:148"/>
daughter <hi>Oriana,</hi> whom at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he beheld with ſuch an eye, as the loue which before he did beare vnto the Queene <hi>Sardamira,</hi> was wholly changed vnto her, beeing captiuated with her excellent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and goodly grace. You may iudge then how he would haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed her if he had ſeene her in the time of her perfect health, which was now much decaied by reaſon of this new iealouſie which ſhe had conceiued againſt <hi>Amadis</hi> which made her looke leane, pale, and wan: but theſe defaults could nothing quench the heate of the fire already kindled in the heart of <hi>Patin,</hi> who was ſo far beſide him-ſelfe, that hee determined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the king to beſtow her vpon him in mariage: making account that it would be eaſily granted, conſidering his birth and high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. Hereupon he tooke leaue of the Ladies, and returned towards the King, who was ready to ſit downe to dinner, the which being ended hee went aſide towards a window, and calling <hi>Patin</hi> vnto him, they talked long together. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards falling from one matter to another, <hi>Patin</hi> ſaid vnto him.

I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen her as wel to haue your alliance as alſo for the beauty and good grace which remaineth in her. I am ſure you are not ignorant (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the place from whence I am deſcended, &amp; the great meanes which cannot faile me, as one day to be Emperor of <hi>Rome)</hi> that if I would elſe where ſet my liking, there is no Prince this day liuing, which would not be very glad to receiue mee for his ſonne in law. Good coſin, anſwered the king, I thanke you for the kindneſſe and honour you do offer me, but the Queene hath alwaies promiſed <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> that ſhe ſhal neuer be maried againſt her will, wherefore before wee grant you any thing, we muſt know of her how ſhe will bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent therewith: this the King ſayd becauſe he would not diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Patin,</hi> for he was not minded to beſtowe his daughter vpon any Prince or Lord that ſhould carry her forth of the land. <hi>Patin</hi> was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with theſe wordes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſome other anſwere of the King, hee ſtayed fiue dayes at the Court, yet the king neuer ſpake to <hi>Oriana</hi> thereof, although he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him that hee had done as much as he could, to cauſe her conſent thereto, but he could in no ſort preuaile with her. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore win her your ſelfe if you can, ſaid he, and pray her to doe that which I ſhall command her. Then <hi>Patin</hi> came vnto her and ſaid. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame I am to deſire a requeſt of you, that ſhall be both honorable and profitable for you, the which I pray you not to deny me. My Lord (anſwered the princeſſe) there is no reaſon to refuſe the grant, being ſuch a reaſonable requeſt as you aſſure me it is, therefore if it pleaſe you, defer not to declare it vnto me. I beſeech you, ſaid <hi>Patin,</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey whatſoeuer the king your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall command you. <hi>Oriand</hi> (who vnderſtood not his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) anſwered him. You may bee aſſured Sir, that I ſhould be very ſorry to do otherwiſe. This anſwere wonderfully contented <hi>Patin,</hi> for he now aſſuredly thought <hi>Oriana</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:7179:149"/>
to be his, and ſaid vnto her, Madam I haue determined to go thorough this countrie to ſeeke ſtrange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures, and I hope to performe ſo high deeds of Arms, as you ſhall ſhortly heare news of my prowes, ſo much to mine aduantage, as very eaſily you will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diſcend vnto that which the king will command you for the loue of me. Herewithall he tooke leaue of her, manifeſting at this time his intention vnto her no farther, and returned vnto the king vnto whom he declared the anſwer of <hi>Oriana,</hi> together with the deſire he had to proue himſelfe againſt al wandring Knights. Do as it pleaſe you, anſwered the king, notwith-ſtanding I would aduiſe you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from ſuch an enterpriſe: for you ſhall finde many ſtrange and very dangerous aduentures, with a great number of knights well exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in armes, who may happily in ſome ſort diſpleaſe you. If they be valiant and hardy, ſaid he, I hope they ſhall not finde any faintnes or cowardlines in me, as my deedes hereafter may witnes. Wel, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the king. Do what you ſhall thinke beſt. Thus <hi>Patin</hi> departed in the hope which he had to enioy <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> for the loue of whom he had framed this ſong, which he ſung when fortune brought him neere the place where <hi>Amadis</hi> made his mone, who vſed him as you haue heard. But now we will leaue him, and recount vnto you what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Durin,</hi> who hauing left <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> returned the next way paſſing by the place where <hi>Patin</hi> lay woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who had taken off his Helmet for the grief of his wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready loſt ſuch ſtore of blood, that his face and armour was all ſtained and couered therewith. He behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Durin,</hi> ſaid to him, Gentle-man, my friend, tell me where I may finde a place to cure my wounds. Truly anſwered hee, I know no place but one, and thoſe whom you ſhall finde there, are ſo ſorrowfull, that I beleeue they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not looke vnto you. Wherefore? ſaid <hi>Patin.</hi> For a Knight (quoth <hi>Durin)</hi> who newly hath wonne the place that I tell you of, and ſeen the images of <hi>Apolidon</hi> and his Lady, which till then no other might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: ſince when he is departed thence ſecretly in ſuch melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as his death is greatly feared Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſaid <hi>Patin,</hi> you ſpeake of the Firme Iſland.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue of late told you that when <hi>Amadis</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the firme Iſland, it was ſo ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Galaor, Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan, Agraies</hi> and others, neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued any thing thereof: you haue alſo heard the oath which he had taken of <hi>Iſania</hi> the gouernour, that he ſhould not declare any thing which he had ſeene, vntill the next morning when maffe was ended: the which <hi>Iſania</hi> performed. For the day following, when the Lords were ready to ſit downe at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they perceiued that <hi>Amadis</hi> was abſent: and enquiring for him, <hi>Iſania</hi> told them that they ſhould know after dinner where hee was become. Thereupon they ſat down thinking that he was gone ſomwhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his pleaſure. After the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were taken vp, <hi>Iſania</hi> ſaid vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. My lords the misfortune of my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> is far worſe then you thinke it is, as I ſhall preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you. Then he recited in what order he deparded from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the great ſorrow wherein hee was, and what he had commanded him to ſay vnto them, eſpecially how he had diſpoſed of the Iſland, and he earneſtly intreated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, ſeeing that he hoped for no remedy of his miſery: For his death was not to bee preuented. When they heard theſe pittifull news, there was not any of them whoſe eyes were not filled with teares, and they began to make a moſt ſorrowfull lamentation. But <hi>Galaor</hi> made the greateſt moane of all, ſaying. If I may releeue him from diſtreſſe, the beſt knight in the world ſhall not in this ſort die. Although he hath commanded vs to ſtay, yet ſhall he not be obeyed for me at this time: but I will ſeeke vntil I ſhal haue found him, &amp; wil know who hath wronged him, that I may eyther reuenge it, or die in the quarell. Beleeue me anſwered <hi>Agraies,</hi> we will not be far behinde you: and if we cannot remedy his misfortune by force of courage, or counſell, yet at the leaſt we will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together die with him for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Moreouer ſaid <hi>Iſania,</hi> he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth you my Lord <hi>Galaor</hi> to make <hi>Gandalin</hi> a knight, and take <hi>Ardan</hi> his dwarff into your ſeruice, whom he recommendeth vnto you. Then <hi>Galaor</hi> called the Dwarff, and ſaid vnto him: <hi>Ardan,</hi> thy maſter hath forſaken vs, and willed that thou ſhouldſt be mine, aſſure thee that ſo long as I liue, I will not leaue thee for his ſake. How? anſwered the Dwarffe, is my Lord dead then? So ſaying, he fel down where he ſtood, and began to teare his haires, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo great ſorrow as it was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, &amp; ſaid: I might well be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a traytor to liue after my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, wherwithal he had ſlain himſelf if they had not take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heed vnto him. <hi>Floreſtan</hi> his heart was ſo ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with griefe that he could ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weep, nor ſpeak, but ſit leuing as if he had been in a traunce. And
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7179:150"/>
when he recouered his ſpeech, he ſaid vnto his fellowes: my Lords, it is no time for vs to weepe nor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when we ſhould rather inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to ſuccour my Lord <hi>Amadis:</hi> let women waile, but let manly mindes conioyne together, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe how we may prouide a remedy for ſo great a miſchiefe. As for me, I thinke that without longer delay we ſhould all to horſeback, making as great ſpeede as we may to finde him, then we may know if there be any meanes to cure his malady: for the time paſſeth, his ſorrow increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and he ſtill goeth farther from vs. The Lord <hi>Iſania</hi> (as he ſaith) hath brought him ſome part of his way, he may ſhew vs then which path he hath taken, but if we ſhall longer tarry, wee may loſe him, without hope euer to ſee him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Therefore my Lords I pray you let vs make haſt to follow him. Vnto the which they all agreed, &amp; cauſed their horſes to be preſently brought. Then <hi>Iſania</hi> conducted them to the place where <hi>Amadis</hi> had left him, and from thence they rode till they came whereas <hi>Patin</hi> lay wounded, whom they beheld lying vpon the ground, whileſt his two eſquires did cut down boughs and poles, to make him a litter: for he was ſo feeble with the loſſe of his blood, that he could not ſit on horſeback, nor anſwere one onely word vnto the knights who ſaluted him, and enquired of him, what he was that had done him ſuch out-rage: but he made a ſigne that his Squires ſhould tell them. Where-upon <hi>Galaor</hi> came, and demanded the matter of them, they anſwered him that he had iouſted againſt a knight which came from the Firme Iſland, by whom hee was ouer-throwne at the firſt encounter, and how that afterwards thinking to reuenge him with his Sworde, he ſped ſo illas they might perceiu by his hurt. What is become of the knight, ſaid <hi>Galaor.</hi> By our faith an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the ſquires, we know not, for we were not preſent at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. Notwithſtauding we do think that we did meete him in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither, and he did ride ouer the forreſt ſo faſt as his horſe could run, hauing none following him but one Squire, who wept bitterly carrying after him his Armour and ſhield, vpon the which were 2. Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſables, in a field Ore. In faith ſaid <hi>Floreſtan</hi> it is he whom we doe ſeeke. Shew vs therefore what way he tooke, the which they did. Then the knights went after him, and ſo long they rode, vntill they came to a croſſe way, where they ſtaid to aduiſe what was beſt to be done: for there was not any body that might tell them any newes of that which they ſought: and therefore they determined to ſeparate them-ſelues, promiſing one vnto another to meete at the Court of king <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart,</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohns</hi> day next enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but if by that time they heard no news of <hi>Amadis,</hi> then they would determine further what to do in the matter, thus taking leaue of each other, they departed with weeping: and afterward they did what they might, but it was all in vaine, although they had ridden through many ſtrange countries in which they found many great accidents &amp; perilous aduentures. But you muſt know, that ſo ſoone as <hi>Amadis</hi> had ſent <hi>Durin</hi> away, he ſet ſpurres vnto his horſe, neyther caring, nor determining what way he ſhould take, &amp; he went euen as fortune guided him: in the end hee came to the bottom of an obſcure valley, ful of vnderwood &amp; buſhes which place he thought moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7179:150"/>
to hide himſelfe from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found out of any that might follow him. Here did he alight, letting his horſe goe where hee would, but vnbridled him not: then he ſate down by the ſide of a brook, which deſcended from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and tooke a little water to refreſh him withall. By this time <hi>Gandalin</hi> had ouertaken him, who had ſtayed behinde to deliuer <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> his Sword, who finding <hi>Amadis</hi> laid all along vpon the graſſe, ſo ſtill that he heard not one word to proceede from him: hee durſt not ſay any thing to him, but ſate downe hard by him, and within a while after <hi>Amadis</hi> roſe vp, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding <hi>Gandalin</hi> laide vpon the ground by him, hee puſhed him with his foote ſaying, ſleepeſt thou <hi>Gandalin?</hi> By my faith ſir no, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, for in ſtead of ſleeping, I thought vpon two things which concerne you greatly, the which (if it pleaſe you) I will declare, if not, I will hold my peace. Go to riſe ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> and take our hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for I will get me gone, becauſe I ſhould be very ſory to be found of thoſe (who it may be) do follow me. Truly anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> me thinks you are farre enough out of the way: beſides your horſe is ſo wearie, as if you let him not reſt a little, it is impoſſible for him to beare you any longer. I pray thee ſaid he, (in weeping) do what thou ſhalt thinke beſt, for whether I ſtay or goe, my ſorrows are remediles. Eate then a little of this bread which I haue brought for your ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> but he refuſed it. What will you then do ſaid he, ſhall I tell you whereupon I ſtudied euen now? It is all one to me anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I thinke on nothing ſo much as my death. Then hearken vnto me if it pleaſe you, ſaid <hi>Gandalin,</hi> I haue long time muſed vpon the letter which <hi>Oriana</hi> ſent vnto you, as alſo vpon the words which the knight vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt whom you did fight, and ſo conſequently vpon the lightneſſe and inconſtancy where-with women are endued: for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe hath changed her loue and your ſelfe for a ſtranger, ſhee witneſſeth very well what truſt a man ſhould repoſe in ſuch as ſhe is: and on the other ſide, when I conſider her vertues, I thinke it in a manner impoſſible, that ſhe ſhould ſo farre forget her ſelfe. But it may be that in your abſence, ſome falſe report of you, hath been made vnto her, whereby ſhe hath conceiued this diſpleaſure againſt you, the concealing whereof ſo much the more increaſed her grief. Notwithſtanding, ſeeing you are aſſured that you neuer offended her, although ſhe haue beene too credulous, yet in the end the truth will be knowne, and thereby your innocency the more apparant, it ſeemeth vnto me that you ſhould not thus deſpaire, ſeeing that ſhee may repent her folly, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the wrong which ſhe hath done vnto you, in ſuch ſort as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring pardon for her miſconceit, ſhe may make you amends with more ioy &amp; contentment then you euer yet enioyed together: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inforce your ſelfe to eate, that you may be able hereafter to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue your life, but if you do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuffer the ſame thus to be loſt, you ſhall alſo looſe all the good &amp; honor that euer you may or can hope for in this world. Hold thy peace ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> for thou haſt ſo ſhamefully and wickedly lied, as I know no man which would not be diſpleaſed to heare thee thus to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her, becauſe that ſo wiſe a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7179:151"/>
Princeſſe neuer did amiſſe at any time: and if I die, I haue well deſerued it, ſeeing that ſhe ſhall be obeied and ſatisfied euen vntill my death. And be thou aſſured, if I did not thinke that thou ſpeakeſt this, onely with intent thereby to aſſwage my ſorrow: I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtrike thy head from thy ſhoulders, for the offence which thou haſt done vnto me, and take heed that henceforth you commit not the like fault.</p>
                  <p>When he had ſo ſaid, he aroſe vp in a great rage, and walked vp along the riuer, ſo penſiue that he knew not what way he ſhould take. Which <hi>Gandalin</hi> perceiuing, (fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his anger, and thinking alſo that he would not goe farre) he let him alone and laid him downe to ſleepe, his eyes beeing very heauie with watching. When <hi>Amadis</hi> was returned vnto him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him ſo ſound aſleepe, hee would not wake him, but took his owne horſe and ſadled him, then did he hide the bridle and harneſſe of <hi>Gandalins</hi> horſe in the buſhes, to the end when he awaked he might not follow him. Then he armed himſelfe and mounted on horſe-backe, coaſting ouer the top of the mountaine. Thus without any ſtay at all, hee rode till it was within foure houres of the ſun ſetting, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending then into a great plaine, where there were two high trees, and vnder them a faire fountaine, commonly called, The fountaine of the plaine field: to which hee went to water his horſe. And as he approched neere the fountaine, he beheld a religious man clothed poorly in a garment made of gotes haire, hauing his beard and head all white, who was watering his Aſſe. <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaluted him, asking him if he were a Prieſt. Truely, ſaid the olde man, it is more then forty yeeres ſince I firſt ſaid Maſſe. The gladder am I thereof, ſaid <hi>Amadis.</hi> Then he alighted &amp; took his ſaddle and bridle from his horſe, who fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe at liberty, began to run towards the Forreſt, <hi>Amadis</hi> minding not to follow him, but threw off all his armour, which done, he kneeled at the olde mans feete, who taking him vp by the hand, made him ſit downe by him: &amp; beholding him well, he thought him to bee the faireſt Gentleman that euer he ſaw, although hee was pale and wan, hauing his face all bedewed with teares: whereat the Hermit was moued with ſo great compaſſion, that hee ſayde vnto him. Knight, you ſeeme to bee full of ſorrow, and if your griefe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from the repentance of any ſinne that you haue committed, In truth my ſon you are very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: and if it bee for any temporall loſſe, then I thinke (ſeeing your youth, and the eſtate wherein you haue liued vnto this preſent, you ſhold not thus vexe your ſelfe, but pray for forgiueneſſe. Then hee gaue him his bleſſing, ſaying. Goe too, now confeſſe your ſins. Here-upon <hi>Amadis</hi> began to tell the whole diſcourſe of his life, with-out letting any thing paſſe. Truely, ſaide the holy man, ſeeing that you are diſcended of ſo high a birth, you ought to bee the more vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: yet you muſt not diſpaire for any tribulation that may happen vnto you, cheefely, for this that proceedeth from the occaſion of a woman, who is as eaſily won as ſhe is lightly loſt. Wherefore my ſon, I councell you to forget ſuch vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and henceforth to baniſh the thought of ſuch a miſerable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life from you, for it will not onely be yrkeſome vnto you, but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7179:151"/>
alſo euery vertuous perſon will condemne you for it. Ah father, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I am now in ſuch extreamitie, that it is impoſſible I ſhould liue any long time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I humbly pray you to receiue mee into your company, and to comfort my poore ſoule, for that little time which it hath to remain in this vnhappy body. When the good oldeman heard him ſpeake with ſuch affection, he ſayde vnto him, I promiſe you my friend, it is ill done of you, who are a knight, yet young and of a comely ſtature, to fall into ſuch deſparie, ſeeing that women cannot continue their loue, but by preſence of thoſe whome they loue: for by nature they are quickly forgetfull, and light of beleefe, eſpecially where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing is reported vnto them of ſuch as haue fondly yeelded them-ſelues to them, who when they think to haue nothing but ioy and contentment, do finde themſelues plunged in all ſorrow and tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as you now feele by experience. Wherefore I pray you henceforth to be more vertuous and conſtant: and ſeeing you are borne a Kings ſon, and likely to gouerne a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, returne to the world, for it ſhould be a great hurt to looſe you in this ſort: and I cannot preſume what ſhe might bee that brought you into this extreamitie, ſeeing that although ſhee were a woman ſo requiſit as ſhee could not bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled, yet for her ſuch a man as you are to be caſt away. Father, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I aske not your counſell herein, for I now neede it not, but for my ſoules ſake I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you henceforth to receiue mee into your company, which if you refuſe to do, I ſee no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for me, but to die amongſt the beaſts of this forreſt. The old man ſeeing him ſo reſolute, had ſuch compaſſion of him, as the teares fell down his long white beard, and anſwered him: Alas my ſon, my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in a deſert place, and I liue a life too ſtrickt for you, my Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage is at the leaſt ſeuen leagues within the ſea, vpon the top of a poore Rock: vnto the which no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creature can come vnleſſe it bee at the beginning of the ſpring time. Notwithſtanding, I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready remained thirty yeeres there, exempted from all worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, liuing onely vpon ſuch ſmall almes, which ſome people of this Countrey doe beſtow vpon me. I promiſe you father, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> it is the life which I deſire, and I once intreat you, that you would giue me leaue to go with you. The which the Hermit at the laſt gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, notwithſtanding, that he had a long time denied him. Heere-withall <hi>Amadis</hi> kiſſed his feete, ſaying: father command whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you ſhall pleaſe, for to my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer I will euer obay you. Then the Hermit ſaide his euening ſeruice, after the which (becauſe hee had eaten nothing all day) hee tooke out of his wallet a little bread, and fiſh dried in the ſun, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto him: and willed <hi>Amadis</hi> to eate with him, but he refuſed it, although he had beene three daies without taſting any ſuſtenance. Wherefore the hermit ſaide vnto him: My ſonne you haue promiſed to obey me, doe this then which I command you, and eat, for if you ſhould die in this obſtinacie, your ſoule ſhould be in very great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For this cauſe <hi>Amadis</hi> durſt not denie him, but did eat a very little, for hee fighed continually, not being able to forget the great ſorrow wherein he remained. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had taken this ſmall refrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7179:152"/>
the good old man ſpread his cloake abroad and laid him downe thereon, and <hi>Amadis</hi> at his feete, who was a great while before hee could take any reſt, tumbling and toſſing himſelfe as a perſon ill at eaſe, neuertheleſſe in the end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heauie with long watching, he fell aſleepe: and hee dreamed that hee was locked in a chamber ſo darke, that he could ſee no light at all, neyther could he finde any way to come out thereof, wherewith he greatly lamented: moreouer hee thought that his Cozin <hi>Mabila</hi> and the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> came vnto him, hauing before them a became of the Sun, which gaue a great light in ſo darke a place: they taking him by the hand ſaid vnto him, My Lord, come forth from hence, if it pleaſe you, and follow vs into the palace, the which he did. But at his comming forth, he thought that he did ſee <hi>Oriana</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed with a great ſlame of fire, which made him ſo afraid, that hee cried out helpe, helpe, my Lady <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> burneth: and therewithall he leaped into the fire to ſaue her. Then he tooke her in his armes, comming through the flame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine without any hurt at all: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards hee carried her into a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the greeneſt and pleaſanteſt that he had ſeene. At the lowde cry which <hi>Amadis</hi> did make, the good Hermit awaked, and taking him by the hand, hee asked him, what he ailed? Father, anſwered he, I haue euen now in my ſleepe felt ſuch exceeding paine, that I meruaile I am not dead. Your cry hath witneſſed the ſame, ſaid hee, but let vs riſe, for it is time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. Then he got vpon his Aſſe, and tooke the way toward the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage, and <hi>Amadis</hi> followed him a foote, talking together of many things, at the laſt he prayed him to giue him one gift, which ſhould not bee hurtfull vnto him, the which the old man granted, I pray you then ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> that ſo long as we are together, you would not tell any man who I am: and hence-forth to giue mee another name, ſuch as it ſhall pleaſe you: then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my death you may tell my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of me, that they may come fetch my body, and carry it into <hi>Gaule.</hi> Your life and death, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the hermit, are in the hands of God, therefore ſpeake no more thereof, for therein you offend him very grieuouſly: and therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you know him, loue him, and ſerue him as you are bound to do, he wil ſuccour and helpe you: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what other name wil you haue? Such as it ſhall pleaſe you to giue me, ſaid <hi>Amadis.</hi> And as they talked together, the olde man had his eye continually vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and the more he looked on him, the fayrer he thought him to be: but he did ſee him ſo full of griefe as he determined to giue him a name conformable to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and agreeable to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. Whereupon he ſaid vnto him: my Sonne you are yong and of a faire complexion, notwith-ſtanding your life is obſcure, by reaſon of your ſorrow, therefore my will is that you bee called the <hi>Faire F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7179:152"/>
the poore Rock, ſo called becauſe of the barrenneſſe of the place, as the old man had declared to him. Who continuing his diſcourſe, ſaid, Sonne I haue heretofore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the world as you haue done, and my name was <hi>Andahod,</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you that during my young yeeres, I ſtudied many vaine ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but in the end being wearie thereof, I withdrew my ſelfe into this poore place, where I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready remained thirty yeeres and more, and neuer departed thence vntill yeeſterday, that I was at the buriall of my ſiſter, who died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few dayes. When the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> came into this Solitary place, he was exceeding glad: ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that in a very ſhort time his ſadneſſe and his life would both end at once. Thus he remained in the company of the hermit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming his youth with weeping and continuall lamentations, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at naught all worldly honours, eſpecially the glory which he had gotten in fighting with <hi>Galpan, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> King of <hi>Ireland, Dardan</hi> the proud, and many others whom he had ouercome, and he began to deſpiſe in himſelfe all vanities, conſidering the variableneſſe of Fortune. who not long before had ſo highly aduanced him, that hee had entred into the forbidden Chamber of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> as in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Hiſtory hath beene mentioned. But if he had beene demanded what moued him ſo to do, what would hee (thinke you) haue anſwered? no other thing (as I gueſſe) but that the diſpleaſure of a weake woman, had brought him to this extremity: he would haue tried to colour his fault by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the ſtrong and valiant <hi>Hercules, Sampſon,</hi> the wiſe <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Virgill,</hi> and an infinit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other great and vertuous perſonages which haue all faln in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the like miſery, being no more able to reſiſt the ſame then he. And <hi>Amadis</hi> would haue thought their misfortunes ſufficient to ſhaddow his miſerie, and yet it is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: for their example might haue warned him to haue ſhunned the like folly. Was it likely then that Fortune would bring him out of his calamity, he being thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome for ſo ſmall a cauſe, and to beſtow vpon him afterwards more fauours and victories then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhe had done before? me think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that ſhe ſhould not: neither yet had ſhe done it, if thoſe things by her executed againſt him, had not turned to the profit of the perſons whom ſhe would fauour, whoſe liues depended vpon <hi>Amadis</hi> his ſafety, whom ſhe tormented in ſuch ſort, as it ſeemed ſhe had more compaſſion vpon them, then care of him, as your ſelfe may iudge. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>Amadis</hi> being as it were brought vnto the period of his life, (when he leaſt hoped of remedie) euen then was he reſtored vnto his former eſtate by ſuch meanes, as ſhal be hereafter recited vnto you. But to the end that we ſtray not too farre from the order of our hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, you muſt firſt vnderſtand that which happened to <hi>Gandalin</hi> after he awaked and found neither <hi>Amadis</hi> nor his horſe: who riſing vp in a fright, miſdonbted that which was happened, and looked in all places thereabout, notwith-ſtanding he could ſee nothing but Trees and Buſhes. By meanes whereof he began to cry and call, yet no body anſwered him but the Eccho which reſounded thorow the valley: whereby he knew well that <hi>Amadis</hi> was departed. For this cauſe he began to make a moſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7179:153"/>
ſorrowfull lamentations, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to follow him, and to doe what he could to find him againe, which that he might the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh; hee returned where hee had left his horſe, the which hee found, hauing neither ſaddle nor bridle vpon him, which made him almoſt beſide himſelfe. But as hee fretted and ſought from one place to another, in the middeſt of the buſhes hee eſpied the harneſſe of his horſe, which he ſought, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore incontinently he ſadled him, and mounted vpon him, gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping through the forreſt not knowing which way to take: and in this frenſie he rode fiue daies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without any ſtay at all, but at the ſide of the villages, where he onely taried to enquire after <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi> Notwithſtanding, he could heare no newes of him till the ſixt day, that he entred into a meddow wherein was a fountaine, hard by the which <hi>Amadis</hi> had left his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. There he beheld a Pauillion ſet vp, and two Gentlewomen, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom hee came, asking them if they had ſeene a knight paſſe by, bearing in his ſhield two Lions <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> in a field <hi>Or.</hi> Wee haue not ſeene the knight which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand after, anſwered they, but we did finde his ſhield and the reſt of his armour vpon the brinke of this fountaine.

Alas what miſ-fortune is hapned, the beſt knight in the world, is he loſt? heerewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all did hee encreaſe his laments ſo ſtrangely, as both the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had great compaſſion vpon his miſerie: Alas my Lord, ſayde hee, how badly haue I kept you: truely I am worthy to bee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the moſt wicked eſquire that liueth on the earth, hauing ſo lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſaken you, and you who were wont to be the defence and refuge of all diſtreſſed perſons, haue now nor cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of any liuing wight, no not of me caitife as I am, that through my great fault and ſluggiſhneſſe, haue left you in your greateſt neede, euen when I ought beſt to haue ſerued you. No ſoner had he ſaid theſe words, but that hee fell downe in a ſwound: which when the Gentlewomen behelde, they cryed: Alas this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquire is dead, and therewithall they ran vnto him, but hee moued not in any ſort. Neuertheleſſe, they beſtirred them ſo well, as they brought him againe to himſelfe, &amp; afterwards they ſayd vnto him: my friend, you are to blame thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire for a thing whereof you are yet vncertaine. It were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for you to goe ſeeke your maiſter, ſeeing that the vertuous (as you ought to bee) do encreaſe their ſtrength, euen when aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie moſt aſſaileth them. <hi>Gandalin</hi> knew that they ſayde true, and for the ſame cauſe he determined (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their counſell) to trauaile ſo long from place to place, vntill he had newes of <hi>Amadis.</hi> But I pray you Gentlewomen, anſwered hee, tell me where you haue found his armour?

Beleeue me this place is farre vnworthy to hold the ſhield of the beſt Knight in the world. Then did hee take it vp from the ground, and hanged it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Tree. Which done hee mounted againe vpon his horſe, commanding vs expreſſely that we ſhould keepe it vntill hee had found the Knight to whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained: And to that end we did ſet vp theſe Pauilions which you ſee. Notwithſtanding after we had kept the ſame three whole dayes, he returned, and arriued but yeſterday very late hauing no news of him at all, and very early this morning he commanded his Eſquires to take the reſt of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which were here found, and he tooke off his owne ſhield, to hang about his necke, the other which we did keepe. In the doing whereof he wept bitterly and ſaid. Truly ſhield thou makeſt a bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of thy Maſter, for me: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he told vs that he went to the Court of king <hi>Liſuart</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thoſe ſpoyles vnto Queene <hi>Briſena,</hi> being aſſured that ſhee would be no leſſe ſorrowfull then he, for the ſad miſchance, and wee likewiſe do follow after him, to thanke the Queene for the good which <hi>Guillan</hi> hath done for vs, for her ſake, as he hath commanded vs to do.

that vnto you and others it will ſeeme in a manner incredible. At my departure from hence (as it pleaſed you to command mee) I went without any ſtay, vnto the Citty of <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> where I found the Queene <hi>Briolania,</hi> who (in my opinion) next vnto you, is the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt princeſſe of the world, and of the beſt grace.

Thus did he win the Signory of the firm Iſland, and al the inhabitants there-of haue already ſworne vnto him homage, and fealty, according to the cuſtome of the Country, which is one of the faireſt and ſtrongeſt places in the world. And I aſſure you Madame, that it is more then an hundred yeeres ſince any liuing creature hath paſſed the pillars, but onely my Lord <hi>Amadis:</hi> by whoſe force and ſtrength we haue ſeene all the ſingular things and riches of the pallace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentrous Chamber, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned thorow all the parts of the Earth.

Then declared hee the whole circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and manner how he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the letter, and the deſpaire hee entred into after he had read it: ſo as, ſaid <hi>Durin,</hi> he did ſhortly after that, ſecretly departe from the Pallace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> with <hi>Gandalin, Iſania</hi> the Gouernour of the Iſle, and me, and we brought him vnto an hermitage, where hee charged vs ſteightly to follow him no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: then hee mounted on horſe-back, and taking with him neither Helmet, Shield, nor Lance, he fled ouer a mountaine like vnto a mad man. Afterward hee reherſed vnto her all the talke which particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he had vſed vnto them, in taking his leaue of them, and <hi>Durin</hi> made this diſcourſe with ſo many teares, as it was very hard to iudge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee or <hi>Oriana</hi> had the more ſorrowfull heart.

All this while <hi>Gandalin</hi> and I hid our ſelues for feare of his furie, by meanes whereof without any impeachment of vs, he paſſed the moſt part of the night in the like lamentations, vntill about the breake of day, that there chaunced a knight to come ſinging a ſong, which he had made for the loue of you, the which <hi>Durin</hi> recited vnto her, as alſo that which happened vnto <hi>Patin,</hi> which ſo ouer-char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the heart of <hi>Oriana,</hi> that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in a ſwound, looking like one that were dead.

Ah my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> do you think that he will euer vouchſafe, either to reſpect me, or make one ſteppe for me? But do you thinke, ſaide <hi>Mabila,</hi> that the loue he beareth to you, is of ſo little force, that he will not bee farre more glad to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer your good fauour, then he hath beene ſorry to be by you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken? I am verily aſſured, that to die he will not diſpleaſe you. And to accompliſh this matter well, it behoueth the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi> to vndertake the charge to finde him out, becauſe he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her, and putteth his truſt in her. Well, anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be aduiſed by you. So ſhee tooke paper and inke, and as they had determined ſhe did write vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> afterwards the Letter was giuen to the Damoſel of <hi>Denmark,</hi> with expreſſe commandement to paſſe firſt into <hi>Scotland,</hi> thinking that he might be there with <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales,</hi> rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any other place. And the better to colour their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, they aduiſed the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to tell the Queene, that <hi>Mabila</hi> ſent her towards the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> her Mother, to vnderſtand ſome news from her: With the which the Queen was well pleaſed, and gaue her a Letter and tokens to preſent vnto her. Thus was the Gentlewoman diſpatched, who departed with <hi>Durin</hi> her brother, and <hi>Enil</hi> the Coſin of <hi>Gandales.</hi> And ſo long they rode till they came vnto a port towne called <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill,</hi> which ſeparateth great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> from the Realme of <hi>Scotland.</hi> There they tooke ſhipping, and they had the winde ſo faire, that the ſixt day following they landed in the Citty of <hi>Poligez.</hi> Then tooke they their way toward the Knight <hi>Gandales,</hi> whom they met a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: but when he beheld the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> (knowing that ſhe was a ſtranger) he ſtayed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of her what ſhe did ſeek in that Countrey.

The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman was herewith much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, ſeeing that ſhe had miſſed of her purpoſe: notwithſtanding diſſembling her ſorrow, ſhe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Gandales:</hi> that he was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Court ſince he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted thence to reuenge <hi>Briolania:</hi> and it is thought that he is come into theſe parts with his coſin <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies,</hi> to ſee the Scottiſh Queene his Aunt, and you alſo: for this cauſe the Queene and other Ladies of his kindred and deere friends, gaue me in charge to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him a Letter, which will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry welcome vnto him I am ſure.

Now they were yong and ſtrong, ſo that they defended themſelues ſtoutly: notwithſtanding at the laſt they could not long reſiſt him that had

charged them. Who after hee had ſome ſmal time fought with them, thruſt his ſword in the throat of the eldeſt, and the other fled vp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the top of the mountaine, who was not long purſued by <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> becauſe hee was a little woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whereupon he let him go and followed on his way, along the which he rode ſo far, vntill he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued at a Caſtle, belonging vnto a knight of his acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, where hee lodged for that night, beeing then very late. But the next day (as hee would haue departed from his lodging) his hoſt ſeeing him with-out a Launce gaue him one, from thence hee rode ſo long, that hee came neere a riuer named <hi>Guinon,</hi> ouer the which there was a bridge no broder then for two horſes to paſſe ouer afront. And approching more neere thereunto, he beheld a knight entering vpon the ſame, whoſe ſhield was vert, a bent <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</hi> This he knew to bee his coſin <hi>Ladaſin;</hi> and on the other ſide hee ſaw another knight ready to fight, who forbad <hi>Ladaſin</hi> from paſſing ouer, except hee would breake a Lance with him, but <hi>Ladaſin</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, that he would not ſtay for ſo ſmall a thing, and herewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all couering him with his ſhield, he ſet ſpurres vnto his horſe. As much did hee that kept the paſſage, who was mounted vpon a great bay courſer, and did beare in his ſhield <hi>Argent</hi> a Lion <hi>Sables,</hi> and his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met all blacke. Their encounter was ſo ſtrong, that <hi>Ladaſin</hi> fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water, where without doubt he had beene drowned (as well for the weight of his armour, as alſo for the high of the place from whence he fell) if he had not taken holde of certaine willowes, by meanes whereof hee got vnto the banck ſide. In the meane ſeaſon he that had ouer-throwne him retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned faire and ſoftly from whence he was departed. Then <hi>Guillan</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his coſin in ſuch danger, ranne ſpeedily to helpe him, and cauſed him to be pulled vp by his ſquires, and afterwards he ſaide vnto him: truſt me coſin without the helpe of theſe boughes you had beene in great danger, and therefore all ſtrange knights ſhould feare to iuſt vpon ſuch bridges: for thoſe which do keepe ſuch paſſages haue their horſes no ſmall time experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for the purpoſe, with whome (more then by their owne prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe) they gaine the honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation ouer a number of better knights then themſelues are. And as for me, I would rather turne out of the way a dayes iourney, then put my ſelfe in ſuch hazard, were it not to reuenge you if I can. Now the horſe of <hi>Ladaſin</hi> had not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his maiſter, but was paſſed ouer to the other ſide of the riuer, and the knight of the bridge his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquires were there ready to take him, who caried him into a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and ſtrong tower, ſeated in the middeſt of the water. Wherefore <hi>Guillan</hi> tooke his ſhield, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched his Lance, he called vnto the knight of the bridge, that he ſhould take heede of him, who ran againſt him, and they met together with a moſt ſtrong encounter: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it fell out ſo well for <hi>Guillan,</hi> that he ouerthrew his enemy toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his horſe into the riuer, and himſelfe had ſped little better, for he was vnhorſed as well as the other, if in falling his horſe had not ſlipped by the one ſide of him, and he taken hold of certaine ſtakes, by the which he got vpon the bridge again, from whence he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the knight in the riuer, who hauing cought hold by the taile of

I thinke you ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this iniurie which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready you haue done vnto them, ſeeing that all bridges ought to be free for euery paſſenger. I care not anſwered the knight, go tell them, they muſt feele (will they nil they) how my ſword cutteth: then hee leaped vpon his horſe moſt lightly without any helpe of his ſtirrop, afterwards comming neere vnto <hi>Guilla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> he ſaid vnto him very fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and boldly: knight your embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour hath beene ouer tedious in deliuering his meſſage, but before you eſcape me, you muſt of force tell me, whether you be any of the ſubiects to a king called <hi>Liſuart,</hi> or any of his houſhould.

                     <l>My ſelfe haue murthered, and my glory ſlaine.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> paſſed away the time, waiting vntill fate or better fortune ſhould bring him forth of this miſerie. But it happened that one night lying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the trees (as hee was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) about the breake of day hee heard very nigh him the ſound of a moſt ſweete inſtrument, wherein he tooke ſo great pleaſure, that he gaue attentiue eare thereunto a good while, amazed notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from whence it might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede. Knowing the place to bee ſolitary that no other there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but the hermit, his two Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, and himſelfe: wherefore he roſe vp, without making any noyſe at all, and approched more neere to ſee what it might be. Then he beheld two young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſitting by a fountaine, who (tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their voyſes to the ſound of a lute) did ſing a moſt pleaſant ſong: neuertheleſſe fearing to trouble their mirth, hee ſtood ſtill a great while without being by them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. Afterwards he came forth and diſcloſed himſelfe, ſaying vnto them: Truely Gentlewomen your muſicke hath made me this day to looſe Matins, for the which I am very ſorry. When theſe women heard him ſpeake (hauing not ſeen him at all vntill that time) they were much afraide. Norwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, one of them more bold then her fellow, anſwered him: My friend, we did not thinke to offend you with this our mirth, but ſeeing we haue ſo luckily found you, tell vs (if it pleaſe you) who you are, and how this deſert place is called. In truth faire Gentlewomen, ſaide the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> this place is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the poore Rock: wherein there liueth an Hermit, vpon the top thereof in his little hermitage. As for me, I am a poore man that keep him company, doing great and hard penance for the ſin and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe which I haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Gentle friend, anſwered they,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7179:160"/>
may we finde in this place (for two or three dayes onely) any houſe wherein we may place at eaſe a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy both rich &amp; mighty, ſo tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with loue, that ſhe is euen at deaths dore therewith. Truſt me ſaid he, there is no other lodging in this Rock, but the little cabinet wherein the Hermit doth lie, and one other that I do ſleepe in ſome-time: but if the Hermit will lend you mine, I am content (to do you a pleaſure) to lie in the meane time abroad in the fields, as I common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſe to do. The Gentlewoman gaue him hearty thankes, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him good morrow they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted towards a Pauilion: within the which the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> beheld a moſt beautifull Lady vpon a bed. Wherupon he knew that the ſame was ſhee of whom they told him. But looking farder off, he did ſee foure armed men walking by the Sea ſide, who ſcouted abroad, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt fiue others did take their reſt, and he alſo perceiued a ſhippe at Anchor well appointed. The Sun was already vp, when he heard the Hermitage bell to ring, which made him go vp thither. Where he found the Hermit making him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to goe to ſeruice: vnto whom he tolde that there were people newly arriued in the Rock, and that if it were his pleaſure, hee would willingly goe call them to heare Mattins. Goe then anſwered the Hermit, and I will ſtay for them. And as he went downe the Rocke, he met the Lady, whom the knights carried toward the hermitage: wherefore he returned, to helpe to make ready the Hermit, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lady was come, began ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Then the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> being amongſt the women, began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the time when he was in the Court of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and of the pleaſure hee was won to haue with the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> &amp; there-withall he began to weepe ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, that the Gentlewomen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it, and did very much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereat. Notwithſtanding they thought that it was for the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſinnes, and ſeeing him young, fayre, and comely, they could not thinke what to preſume thereof. When the Hermit had made an end of ſeruice, they came to ſalute him, praying him for Gods ſake, to lend them ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle chamber for their Lady (who was wearie of the Sea, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely ſicke) wherein ſhe might take her reſt, for a day or twaine. In truth faire Ladies, anſwered he, there are here no more then two ſmall Cabinets, in one of them I remaine (and if I can ſo long as I liue, neuer woman ſhall come ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) and the other is for this poore man, which doth ſuch great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, wherein ſometimes he ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, and I would be very ſory that he ſhould bee put out thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will. Father ſaid the <hi>Fare Forlorne,</hi> do not let for me to doe them a pleaſure, for I am very well content for this time to haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lodging then vnder the Trees. Well ſaid the hermit, let it be ſo a Gods name. Then the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne</hi> conducted them vnto his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, where the Gentlewomen ſet vp a rich bed for their Miſtreſſe, who was forthwith carried thither. And becauſe it was told the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> that her ſickneſſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of extreame loue, he tooke more heede to her behauiour then to any of the reſt: and he perceiued that her eyes were ſtill full of Teares, and her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ighs were at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: Wherefore hee drew the two Gentlewomen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, whom in the morning hee
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7179:160"/>
had found playing on the Lute, &amp; earneſtly entreated them to tell the occaſion of the great ſickneſſe that their Miſtreſſe ſuſtained. Friend an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered they, if you marke her well you ſhall find that ſhe is very faire, although that now her diſeaſe hath abated a great part of her beauty: for ſhee hath neither comfort nor ioy by reaſon of the abſence of a knight that ſhee goeth to ſeeke in the houſe of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> whom ſhe ſo feruently loueth, that if ſhort time doe not graunt ſome eaſe to her paſſion, it is impoſſible that her life ſhould continue long. When the <hi>Faire Forlorn</hi> heard king <hi>Liſuart</hi> named, hee could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from teares, and hee had a greater deſire then before, to know the name of the knight that ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: therefore he requeſted them very earneſtly to tell him his name, in good ſooth anſwered the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, hardly may you knowe him: for hee is not of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: yet is hee eſteemed the beſt knight in the world, next vnto two other of his kin. Alas my faire gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman ſayd hee, for Gods ſake name him vnto me, and the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom you ſo much ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oll. Truely anſwered they, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, vpon this condition, that firſt when wee haue done, you doe tell vs whether you bee a knight or not, and afterward your name. I am content therewith, ſayde the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> ſo great is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to knowe that which I demand of you. Then one of them ſayd vnto him: the knight which this Lady loueth, is called <hi>Don Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> brother to the good Knight <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and to <hi>Don Galaor,</hi> and hee is the ſonne of King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and of the Counteſſe of <hi>Salandria.</hi> You ſay true anſwered hee, and I verily beleeue that you cannot ſay ſo much good of him as hee deſerueth. What? ſayde the Gentlewomen, doe you know him then? It is not long ſayd he, ſince I did ſee him in the houſe of Queen <hi>Briolanie,</hi> for whom his brother <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> and his Coſen <hi>Agraies</hi> did fight againſt <hi>Abiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s</hi> and his two ſonnes, and thither hee with his brother <hi>Galaor</hi> arriued ſome fewe dayes after the combate: and I thinke him to be one of the faireſt knights in the worlde. As cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his proweſſe, I haue many times heard <hi>Don Galaor</hi> himſelfe ſpeake thereof, who fought a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with him as hee ſayde. This combate ſayde ſhee, was the cauſe that hee left my Lady in the ſelfe ſame place, where they firſt knew one another. I thinke then anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> that ſhee is called <hi>Coriſanda.</hi> You ſay true ſayd the Gentlewomen. In truth anſwered he, I am no leſſe ſory for her ſickneſſe then before, for I knowe <hi>Floreſtan</hi> to bee ſo wiſe, and of ſo good behauiour, that I am ſure hee will doe all that which ſhe ſhall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand him. God grant it ſayd ſhee, but ſeeing wee haue ſatisfied you, acquire you of your promiſe and tell vs who you are. Gentlewoman anſwered the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> I am a knight who haue heretofore had more pleaſure in the vanities of the worlde then now I haue, for the which I heere abide ſharpe penance, my name is the <hi>Faire Forlorne.</hi> By my truth ſaid one of them, you haue taken a good courſe, if you are able there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to continue. And becauſe there is no reaſon now to leaue our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe all alone in this her great melancholy, wee bid you farewell, and doe goe vnto her to paſſe away the time with ſuch muſicke as you did heare this morning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:7179:161"/>
Then the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but hee was preſently called backe againe, for as ſoone as the gentlewomen had played two or three ſongs, they rehearſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Coriſanda</hi> all that hee had ſaide of <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> and that the poore man which did penance, had ſeen him not many dayes before. Wherefore ſhe ſent to pray him to come vnto her, and in the meane while ſhee ſayde vnto her women: aſſure you this Hermit that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> muſt needs be ſome great perſonage diſguiſed. At the ſame inſtant the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> was come, and ſhe ſayd vnto him: my friend, my women tell me that you know <hi>Don Floreſtan,</hi> and that you doe very well loue him, I pray you (by the holy order that you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) to tell me what acquaintance you haue had with him, and where you did laſt ſee him. Then the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> told her more of him then hee had tolde vnto the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and how hee knew very well, that he and his brethren, with their Coſen <hi>Agraies,</hi> had beene in the Firme-Iſland: for he had there left them, and neuer ſince had ſeene them. Ah ſayd ſhe, I beleeue that you are ſomething a kinne vnto him, ſeeing the great good you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of him. Madame, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> I loue him intirely, as well for his valour, as alſo for that his father made me knight, which maketh me the more bounden vnto his children: and I am very ſory for the newes that I haue hard of <hi>Amadis</hi> before I did come vnto this deſert. What are they ſayd <hi>Coriſanda.</hi> Truely anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hee, comming hither I met with a Gentlewoman at the entry of a Forreſt which ſung a pleaſant ſong for the tune, but very pittifull by reaſon of the matter that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned. Then I enquired of her who made it, and ſhee anſwered me, that it was a knight, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God (if it bee his pleaſure) ſend more ioy then hee had when hee made it, for his ſong doth very wel witneſſe, that his griefe proceeded from too extreame loue. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I liked it wel, I remained with the Gentlewoman ſo long vntill I had learned it: moreouer ſhe did aſſure me that <hi>Amadis</hi> did make it, and that he did ſhew her the ſong at that time when by his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly hee was moſt maiſtered. I pray you ſayde <hi>Coriſanda,</hi> teach it vnto theſe two Gentlewomen, for by that which you ſay, loue held him then in as great bondage as he now holdeth me. I will doe it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered hee, both for the honour of him and alſo of you, althought it be a thing farre vnſeemely for me to do. Herewithall he withdrew the Gentlewomen a part, and taught them the ſong with the tune there-of, wherein they tooke great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, becauſe the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> did ſing it with a lamentable and ſoft voyce, which yeelded more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and aptneſſe, both to the tune and the matter, then he could if hee had beene at more liberty in body and minde: and the Gentle-women learned it ſo cunningly, that many times after they did ſing it before their Miſtris, who tarried foure dayes in the poore Rocke, &amp; the fift ſhee embarqued. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe departed, ſhee demanded of the <hi>Faire forlorne,</hi> whether hee would remaine any long time in that place. Madame, anſwered he, nothing but my death ſhall drawe me from hence. I doe much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile ſayde <hi>Coriſanda,</hi> what moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you to doe ſo: yet ſeeing that you are in ſuch a minde, I will in no ſorte diſſwade yon from it:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7179:161"/>
ſo ſaying, ſhe entred into her ſhip with her companie, bidding the Hermit farewel. Then ſetting ſaile, the winde was ſo fauourable, that in fewe dayes after they landed in Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and arriued in the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> where at that time King <hi>Liſuart</hi> remayned. Who knowing of her arriuall, hee toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Queene receiued her royally. The King to honour her the more, cauſed her to bee lodged in his owne Pallace. And ſome few dayes after, as they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing together, the Queen ſayd vnto her, Good Coſen, the King charged mee to tell you, that hee taketh your comming hither to fee him ſo thankefully, that if you haue any thing to doe with him, he will imploy his beſt meanes to pleaſure you. Madame, anſwered <hi>Coriſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> I giue the King moſt humble thankes, and your grace alſo: there is nothing that importuneth mee more, then the abſence of <hi>Don Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan,</hi> whom I thought to haue found in this Court. Coſen ſayde the Queene, wee haue at this time no other newes, of him, but that hee is gone in ſearch of his brother <hi>Amadis,</hi> who of late is loſt, we not knowing the cauſe thereof. Then ſhee tolde her how hee had wonne the Firme-Iſland, and that after-wardes hee departed ſecretly from his fellowes: eſpecially the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how <hi>Don Guillan</hi> did finde his armour, and what diligence hee had vſed to vnderſtand what was become of him. When <hi>Coriſanda</hi> did ſee that ſhee was fruſtrate of her intention, and vnderſtood the loſſe of <hi>Amadis,</hi> the teares ſtood in her eyes, ſaying: Alas what wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of my Lord and friend <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> I am ſure (conſidering the loue that he beareth vnto his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that if hee cannot finde him, he will loſe himſelfe, ſo that I ſhall neuer while I liue ſee him any more: the Queene comforted her ſo well, that ſhee receiued ſome hope to heare news from him very ſhortly. Now <hi>Oriana</hi> was by, who had heard all this talke, and the loue that <hi>Coriſanda</hi> did beare vnto <hi>Don Floreſtan,</hi> brother to <hi>Amadis:</hi> for which cauſe ſhee had the more deſire to doe her honour, ſo as ſhe and <hi>Mabila</hi> did ordinarily keepe her company, taking great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to heare her recite the loue that paſſed betwixt her and her friend, the cauſe of their parting, and the trauell which afterwardes ſhee had endured in hope to finde him. And as ſhee made this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſhe remembred her of the time when ſhee remayned in the poore Rocke, where ſhee found a knight doing penance, who during her abode there, taught a ſong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her women: which <hi>Amadis</hi> had made being in great melancholy, as the companion of the Hermit had aſſured her. Madame anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Mabila,</hi> I pray you ſeeing your Gentlewomen haue learned it, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them to ſing it before my Lady <hi>Oriana:</hi> for I ſhall bee very glad to heare it, ſeeing it is made by <hi>Amadis,</hi> who is mine owne Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. Beleeue mee ſayd <hi>Coriſanda,</hi> I am very well content, aſſuring you that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not better pleaſe you then it will delight me, becauſe of the neerneſſe of the linage that is betwixt my Lord <hi>Floreſtan</hi> &amp; him. Then ſhee ſent for the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Lutes, who played and did ſing the ſong of <hi>Amadis</hi> ſo ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it miniſtred both mirth &amp; mone vnto the Ladies which vnto them liſtened: ioy to the eare, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for the melody, and griefe to the minde, in feeling his paſſion, that was ſo grieuouſly pained. But
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7179:162"/>
                     <hi>Oriana</hi> whom it moſt of all touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tooke more heede vnto the matter then the muſicke, knowing the miſchiefe whereof ſhe was cauſe, and the great reaſon that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> had to complaine. Where-upon ſhee was ſuddenly ſtricken with ſo great ſorrow, that ſhe went into a wardroabe, aſhamed for the teares that had iſſued from her eyes in ſo good a company, from which ſhe could not abſtain. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding as ſhee withdrew her ſelfe, <hi>Mabila</hi> (to couer this fault) ſayd vnto <hi>Coriſanda:</hi> So farre as I perceiue, <hi>Oriana</hi> is not well, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to leaue your company at this time, and to goe helpe her: neuertheleſſe, if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed you, I would willingly knowe what was the behauior of him that taught your Gentlewomen the ſong, and wherefore he remayned in the poore Rocke: for no doubt hee did then knowe what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of <hi>Amadis.</hi> Then <hi>Coriſanda</hi> rehearſed vnto her in what ſorte they did finde him, and the talke he had with her: but ſayd ſhee, I did neuer ſee a man more penſiue, nor more faire, conſidering the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he endured. <hi>Mabila</hi> very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly began to ſuſpect that it was <hi>Amadis</hi> himſelfe, who being ſo far from all hope, had choſen ſuch a ſolitary place, becauſe hee would not be ſeene of any liuing wight, and at the ſame inſtant ſhee depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towardes <hi>Oriana,</hi> whom ſhee found weeping bitterly. Vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (with a ſmiling countenance) ſhee ſayd. Madame, in ſeeking after newes, ſometimes one learneth more then hee thinketh vpon, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe this which I haue vnderſtood of <hi>Coriſanda.</hi> The knight ſo ſad, that is named the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> in the poore Rocke, is <hi>Amadis</hi> and no other, who deſirous to obey your commandement hath in ſuch ſort withdrawne himſelfe, becauſe hee would neither be ſeene of you, not of any other perſon: therefore I pray you reioyce, for you ſhall ſhortly drawe him hither againe. Alas anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> may it bee poſſible? I would I might bee ſo fortunate to imbrace him in my armes before I die, and beleeue me Coſen (ſayd ſhe to <hi>Mabila)</hi> that if I may once againe haue him, I will giue him ſuch an occaſion to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, that he ſhall forget all the wrong which I haue done vnto him. But then very ſuddenly like a perſon doubtfull and fearefull to loſe that which ſhe loued, ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make a greater lamentation then before, crying: Ah my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, haue pittie vpon mee, I am in worſe caſe then if I were dead, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate woman as I am: I haue iuſtly loſt by my folly, him vpon whom my good, my ioy, and my life doth wholy depend. How now Madame, ſayd <hi>Mabila,</hi> euen when moſt hope is preſented vnto you, doe you then moſt torment your ſelfe? Aſſute you vpon my faith, if the Gentlewoman of <hi>Denmarke</hi> do not bring you newes of him, that I will finde the meanes to ſupply her want: being ſure, that it is he which nameth himſelfe the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> and no other, and repoſe you vpon me herein.</p>

In the end, the Sea being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, and the ſtorme paſt, about the breake of day they diſcouered the poore Rocke, where they took landing: and becauſe ſome of the Mariners (who knew the place) did tell the Damoſell of <hi>Denmark,</hi> that <hi>Andahod</hi> the deuout Hermit had there his reſidence, ſhee determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to goe heare diuine ſeruice, &amp; to giue God thankes for the good that hee had done for them in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering them from ſuch perill: and without longer ſtay ſhee began to goe vp the Rocke, accompanied with <hi>Durin</hi> and <hi>Euil.</hi> At the ſame time the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> (who by chance had paſſed that night vnder the trees, as hee was accuſtomed) perceiued them, and ſeeing that they came towards him, becauſe hee would not be ſeene hee turned another way, and got to the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage before them, where hee found the Hermit ready to ſay ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. But hee tolde him that there were people newly arriued, who were comming vp the Rocke, and therefore it were good to ſtay, if he pleaſed, vnto the which the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite willingly agreed. At the ſame time was the <hi>Faire Forlorn</hi> ſo leane, wanne, and ſo tanned with the heat of the Sunne, that hee could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be knowen for <hi>Amadis,</hi> for his continuall weeping made ſuch fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes in his face, that there was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7179:163"/>
nothing to bee diſcerned but skin and bone. And as the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and her company entred into the Chappell, hee was vpon his knees lifting vp his eyes to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens and praying that either by his ſpeedy death his care might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or in prolonging his dayes ſome preſent comfort might be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded vnto him. Whileſt he was thus praying, the Hermit beganne his ſeruice, during which time the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> did not once looke vp, to beholde any of them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued vntill it was ended, who caſting his eyes vpon them, hee knew the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> &amp; the reſt. Therewithall hee felt ſuch a motion that (both by reaſon of his great weakeneſſe, as alſo by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her that put him in minde of all his martyrdome) he fell downe all along vpon the ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Hermit thinking that hee had beene dead, cryed out: Ay me is he gone? then God haue mercy vpon his ſoule. Saying ſo, a flood of teares fell from his eyes downe vpon his long hoary beard. Then he ſayd vnto the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke:</hi> I pray you Gentlewoman for charity ſake, command your Eſquires that they may helpe mee to beare my fellow into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for ſo farre as I ſee it ſhall bee the laſt good that wee can doe for him. Whereupon <hi>Enil</hi> and <hi>Durin</hi> tooke him vp, neither of them knowing him. But the Damoſel of <hi>Denmarke</hi> demanded of the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit what he was. Truely anſwered hee, it is a knight which liueth here in penance. Truſt me ſayd the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, hee hath choſen a very au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere life, and in a very deſert place. Hee hath done it, anſwered the Hermit, to ſeparate himſelfe from the vanities of the world. Verily ſayde the Gentlewoman, ſeeing you aſſure me that he is a knight, I will ſee him before I depart: and if there be any thing within the ſhip, which may ſerue his turne, I will cauſe it to bee left for him. It ſhall be well done anſwered hee, but ſo farre as I ſee, he is ſo neare his end, that I beleeue hee will eaſe you of that labour. Herewithall the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell entred into the little cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> was layd, who ſeeing her ſo neere vnto him, knew not what he ſhould do: for hee thought that making him-ſelfe to be known, he ſhould tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the commandement of his <hi>Oriana,</hi> and alſo if ſhee departed, and he not diſcouered, hee ſhould remaine voyde of all hope. In the end he concluded that it were leſſe hurtfull for him to die, then his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſhould be diſpleaſed, therefore hee determined for reſolution not to manifeſt himſelfe in any ſort vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> who ſayd vnto him. My friend I haue been enformed by the Hermit that you are a knight, and becauſe all Gentlewomen are greatly bound vnto good knights, for the benefits and pleaſures that they commonly receiue at their hands in defending them, and deliuering them from many and great dangers, I had a great deſire before I departed to ſee you, to giue vnto you ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions as are in my ſhip, that ſhall be neceſſarie for your health. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he anſwered her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, neither did hee any other thing but lament and ſigh: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in that little Cell where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee remayned, there was little light, the Gentlewoman did not know whether hee were a dying or no. Whereupon ſhe was ware of a window, which ſhe opened, by the light whereof ſhee might behold him more at eaſe: but all the while
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7179:163"/>
that ſhe beheld him, hee neuer caſt his eyes off from her, neuertheleſſe hee ſpake not one word, but ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without ceaſing, like vnto a wight, whoſe heart was ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with woe, which moued the Damoſel to exceeding pittie. And comforting him in the beſt ſorte ſhe could, by chance ſhee eſpied a ſcarre which he had vpon his face, with a blow that <hi>Arcalaus</hi> the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter had giuen him, when hee reſcued <hi>Oriana,</hi> as hath beene reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the firſt Booke. Wherefore ſhee thought in her minde that without doubt this was <hi>Amadis</hi> whom ſhee ſought, and at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſhee did know that he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the ſame, &amp; for the ſame cauſe ſhee being grealy amaſed, cryed out, Alas what do I ſee? My Lord you are he that hath made me haue many a weary iourney to find you: this ſayd, ſhe embraced him. Alas my Lord ſayd ſhee, it is now high time to extend both pitty and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don vnto her, who (procured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by ſome ſiniſter report, hath brought you to this great extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie) beleeue me, doth now iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endure a life worſe then death: then did ſhe deliuer him the Letter that <hi>Oriana</hi> had written vnto him. Hold ſayd ſhe, your Lady ſendeth you this, and commandeth you by me, that if you be the ſame <hi>Amadis</hi> that you were wont to be, and hee who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe ſo much loueth, that (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting all paſſed faults) you come vnto her to the Caſtle of <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> where a full ſatisfaction ſhall bee made vnto you, for the ſorrowes and anguiſhes which you haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for your ouer feruent loue. Herewithall was the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> ſo greatly rauiſhed, that it was a long time before hee could anſwer one word, but hee tooke the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which hee kiſſed without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and afterwards put it next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his heart, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O poore heart ſo long time paſſioned, that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haſt thou beene able to reſiſt ſuch a tempeſt, notwithſtanding the abundance of teares, which thou ſo continually haſt diſtilled, that it hath almoſt brought thee euen to the point of death, receiue now this medicine, the which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is conuenient for thy health, and come forth of this darknes, which ſo long hath blinded thee, taking thy ſtrength againe vnto thee, to ſerue her that of her owne free grace cauſeth thee to reuiue.

                  <p>Herewithall a new ioy poſſeſſed the minde of the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> and hee quite baniſhed the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall melancholy which had ſo long tormented him: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the perplexity wherein <hi>Oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> remained, in expecting newes from him, with-held part of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: wherefore he praied the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> to aduiſe her ſelfe what ſhe had to do, for I feele my ſelfe, ſaid he, ſo farre beſide my ſelfe, that I can thinke vpon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but vpon the new reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of my life, which I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by your meanes. I am of the opinion, anſwered the Damoſell, ſeeing that theſe in my company do not know you, to tell them that for pittie ſake, I will cary you to the Firme Iſland, only to ſee if by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the aire, you may alſo change your malady: the which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly performed. Notwith-ſtanding, the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> before his departure, declared vnto the Hermit, how the Gentlewoman had ſo long ſought for him, that now they were heere caſually met together, onely by meere chance, and the ſtorme which had brought her vnto the poore Rock. And for this cauſe my father, ſaide he, I am conſtrained to leaue you and to follow her, aſſuring you that ſo long as I liue, I ſhall neuer forget the good which you haue done for mee, for without your good help, I had periſhed both body and ſoule. And ſeeing that by your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout praires (as I beleeue) I haue beene preſerued hitherto, I moſt humbly beſeech you to haue your poore gueſt ſtill in remembrance.

the Damoſell. Then came they on ſhoare and tooke their ready way towardes <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> where <hi>Oriana</hi> ſtayed their comming, being well aduiſed to amend the fault that ſhe had made. And the Damoſell in riding together with the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne,</hi> ſayd. What ioy will my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die receiue when ſhe ſhall beholde you? beleeue mee that neuer wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was in a more deſperate caſe then ſhe, when ſhe vnderſtood by <hi>Durin,</hi> the ſorrowe that you had in receiuing her Letter: I aſſure you that ſhee was like to haue died, I doe greatly wonder how ſhee hath beene able vntill this time to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the paſſion, which ſhe yet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth. And you neede not to doubt but that <hi>Mabila</hi> and I were greatly troubled, for none of vs did know that my brother was ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and my Lady had expreſly charged him that in no ſort hee ſhould tell vs thereof, which had likely to haue beene the cauſe of worſe miſchiefe then is yet happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Beleeue me ſaid the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne,</hi> I was neuer in greater danger of death, and I doe maruell where-upon ſhe framed this imagination that ſhee hath conceiued againſt me, ſeeing that I neuer thought to doe any thing which might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe her: and although I ſhould haue ſo farre forgotten my ſelfe, yet did I not deſerue ſuch a cruell Letter as ſhee did write vnto mee. For although I make not thoſe bragges &amp; hipocriſies that a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber can doe, yet doe not I forget to meaſure the fauours and graces which I haue receiued at her hands: and were not this thought ſowen in bad ground, I am ſure ſhe would not be ſuſpicious of the fruit thereof, ſeeing that both the one and the other, are wholly dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſerue and obey her. Alas when <hi>Coriſanda</hi> arriued in our Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I did then verily think that my ende was come: the good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bewailed her paſſion which ſhe indured in louing my brother <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan,</hi> too vehemently, and I died with diſpleaſure, to bee ſo wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully baniſhed by <hi>Oriana.</hi> How many paines, what trauailes, what intollerable torments, haue I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the poore Rocke, without receiuing conſolation from any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creature, but the good Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, who perſwaded mee to pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?

This perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did <hi>Gandalin</hi> make, in weeping ſo extreamly, that it greatly pittied the three knights to behold him, ſo as they concluded, after they had beene in the Court (if they heard not news of <hi>Amadis)</hi> to begin a new purſuit, &amp; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the whole world about till they had found him: and vpon this determination (after they had heard diuine ſeruice) they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the hermitage, and tooke the way towards <hi>London.</hi> But as they approched nere vnto the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they were ware of the King, who was already in the fields ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many noble men, and valiant knights: for hee cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated that day with all magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, becauſe that vpon the ſame he was crowned peaceable king of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> which was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall occaſion that many knights came to ſerue him.

It may pleaſe your Maieſtie, anſwered he, wee haue all three ſought him a whole yeere, yet haue we done no good, but loſt our labour, and we did thinke to haue found him here in your Court: wherefore ſeeing your grace hath certified me to the contrary, I am in worſe hope of his recouery then before. So am not I, ſaide the king, for I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the heauens haue not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued him with ſuch perfections, to forſake him after this manner, which maketh me to beleeue, that we ſhall very ſhortly heare ſome tidings of him. Who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their talke, they entred into the Cittie, where the Queene and the other Ladies were inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently aduertiſed of their arriuall, wherewith they were as glad as might bee, eſpecially <hi>Olinda,</hi> the friend to <hi>Agraies,</hi> who very lately was aduertiſed, that he had paſſed vnder the arch of faithfull louers, and ſhee expected his comming with as great deuotion, as <hi>Coriſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> did the arriuall of <hi>Floreſtan.</hi> Then <hi>Mahila</hi> imagining to do <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> a pleaſure, ran to aduertiſe her: but ſhe found her with-drawn
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7179:166"/>
into her chamber, where ſhee ſawe her leaning her head vpon one of her hands, and reading in a booke, to whom ſhe ſaide: Madame, will you pleaſe to come downe to ſee <hi>Galaor, Agraies</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> who are now newely heere arriued? Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe heard her ſpeake nothing of <hi>Amadis,</hi> a new feare ſtrook at her heart, ſo that ſhe knew not what to doe, and the teares diſtilled from her eyes in ſuch aboundance, that her ſpeech failed. Neuertheleſſe, in the end, not beeing able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble her griefe, ſhee anſwered <hi>Mabila:</hi> my coſin and ſweet friend, how would you haue me to go ſee them? in good ſooth, I haue not my minde ſo well ſetled that I may diſſemble or hide that, which in their preſence I ought to doe. Moreouer mine eyes are ouerſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len with much weeping, and (that which worſe is) it is impoſſible for to behold thoſe, whom I did neuer ſee but in the company of your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, whom I haue ſo highly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Heerewithall her heart was likely to haue left her ſorrowfull body, and ſhe cryed. My God how doe you permit mee wretched wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to liue, being ſo worthy of death? Ah my deere loue, I doe now feele a double griefe for your abſence, ſeeing <hi>Galaor</hi> &amp; the reſt to returne without you, whome you loued as deere as your ſelfe, who knowing the iniury and wicked act that I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againſt you, ſhall haue iuſt cauſe to procure my ruine, whereunto I conſent with a good will, ſeeing that ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſedly I haue beene the meanes of your loſſe. Herewithall ſhe had fallen downe all along, if <hi>Mabila</hi> who ſtreight eſpied it, had not ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her vp, ſaying vnto her: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, will you alwaies continue theſe ſtrange paſſions? I know well that in the end, you will publiſh that to your ſhame, which we doe moſt deſire ſhould be kept ſecret. Is this the conſtancy which you ought to haue, eſpecially ſeeing that day by day we expect to heere good newes by the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke?</hi> Alas, anſwered ſhee, you ſpeake at your pleaſure, is it poſſible that ſhee may finde him, hauing the charge but to ſeek him onely in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſeeing that his brethren haue in a manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed all the Weſt without hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any newes at all of him? You abuſe your ſelfe, ſaide <hi>Mabila,</hi> it may bee that they had found him, but that hee kept himſelfe ſecret from them, the which he wil neuer do fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your Gentlewoman, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe is priuie to both your loues. And therefore be of good cheere vntill her returne, and then doe as you ſhall thinke good: and for this time, let vs goe if it pleaſe you towards the Queene who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth for you. Well, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Oriana,</hi> I am content to doe what you will. Then ſhee dried her eyes, and went in the Queenes chamber, into the which the three knights were already entred: who ſeeing her comming did their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vnto her: at the ſame time the King held <hi>Galaor</hi> by the hand, vnto whom he ſaid: behold I pray you, how your good friend <hi>Oriana</hi> is impaired, ſince you did laſt ſee her. In good faith, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> your Maieſtie ſaith true, and I would with all my heart, that I might doe her any pleaſure, that might purchaſe her former health. Herewithall <hi>Oriana</hi> ſmiled, ſaying vnto <hi>Galaor.</hi> God is the only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter of all men, ſo that when his pleaſure is, my health ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and your loſſes recouered which no doubt are great, for ſo
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7179:166"/>
deere a brother <hi>Amadis</hi> was vnto you. And I would that the trauell which you haue taken to ſeeke him in farre countries, had brought ſome fruit, as well for the good of you and yours, as alſo for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the King my father, vnto the which hee was wholly adicted. Madame anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> I truſt that wee ſhall very ſhortly heare ſome newes of him, becauſe he is the knight that I haue euermore ſeene moſt valiantly to reſiſt all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities. God grant it ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> but I pray you cauſe <hi>Don Floreſtan</hi> to come neere vnto vs, that I may more plainely beholde him, for I haue beene tolde that hee is the knight that doth moſt reſemble your brother <hi>Amadis.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Galaor</hi> called him, and he came &amp; ſaluted <hi>Oriana,</hi> who rooke him by the hand, &amp; they three ſate downe together. Then the Princeſſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that ſhe did verily beholde him, who beeing abſent from her, ſhee had day and night before her eyes, and therefore ſhee began to bluſh and change her colour. Now had <hi>Mabila</hi> in like ſort withdrawn her ſelfe, together with <hi>Olinda,</hi> to giue a better occaſion vnto her brother <hi>Agraies</hi> more priuately to ſpeake vnto her: and therewithall hee ſeeing them in a place ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, came and ſaluted them, then at their requeſt he ſate downe betweene them, in taking <hi>Olinda</hi> ſecretly by the hand. And ſhe who did languiſh for his loue, was the gladdeſt that might be, being ſure of his conſtancy, by the proofe which he had made paſſing vnder the arch of loyall louers in the Firme-Iſland, in recompence whereof ſhe would willingly haue giuen him better intertainement, if ſhe durſt. But the preſence of ſo many witneſſes, took from them not onely the familiarity, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they would haue giuen the one to the other, but alſo the facility and liberty of ſpeech; ſo that their eyes onely ſerued to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this default, which they imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein according to the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their paſſioned harts. And as they were in theſe pleaſant tearms there was heard from the chamber as if it had been the voyce of ſome oppreſſed with grief, wherfore the king would needs know who it was? It may pleaſe your Maieſty anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an Eſquire it is <hi>Gandalin</hi> &amp; the Dwarffe, who no ſooner beheld the ſhield and armour of <hi>Amadis,</hi> but they made and yet continue the ſtrangeſt lamentation that poſſibly may be. What ſayde the King, is <hi>Gandalin</hi> here? He is if it like your Maieſty anſwered <hi>Floreſtan.</hi> It is very neere two monethes ſince I did finde him at the foot of the hill of <hi>Sanguin,</hi> as hee was ſeeking his Maiſter, and becauſe I did tell him that I had already ſought him in euery place, hee was content to come with me. In good faith ſaid the King, I haue alwaies eſteemed <hi>Gandalin</hi> for ſuch a one, as now he ſheweth himſelfe to be, for I did neuer ſee any Eſquire to loue his Maſter better then hee doth.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Oriana</hi> heard theſe words, eſpecially how that <hi>Gandalin</hi> was returned without <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſhe was in ſuch a perplexity, that ſhee was likely to haue ſwouned betweene <hi>Floreſtan</hi> his armes, who not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe of her ſudden paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and fearing to affright the King and the company, called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bila,</hi> who forthwith doubted ſuch a miſchance. Wherefore leauing <hi>Agraies</hi> alone with <hi>Olinda,</hi> ſhee came vnto <hi>Oriana,</hi> and cauſed her ſecretly to depart into her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and to lie downe vpon her
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7179:167"/>
bed, where ſhee remained not long, but that riſing vp as it were almoſt beſide her ſelfe, ſhee ſayd vnto <hi>Mabila:</hi> Coſen, you knowe that ſince our comming to this Cittie, there hath paſſed neuer a day wherein wee haue not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore I am determined to withdrawe my ſelfe for a certaine time vnto my Caſtle of <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> for my heart telleth me that in changing the ayre, I ſhall alſo change my afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that my troubled ſpirit ſhall there finde reſt. Madame, anſwered <hi>Mabila,</hi> I am of the ſame opinion, to the end that when the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, you may more priuately ſpeake with her, and pleaſure him that ſhee (I hope) ſhall bring with her, the which would be very hard, yea almoſt impoſſible to doe in this place. As you loue mee then ſayd <hi>Oriana,</hi> let vs not carry any longer: for I am ſure the King and Queene will very willingly giue vs leaue.</p>
                  <p>Now you muſt vnderſtand, that this place of <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> was a little Caſtle moſt pleaſantly ſeated two leagues from <hi>London,</hi> built vpon the ſide of a hill, and compaſſed vpon the one ſide with the Forreſt, and vpon the other with many Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, full of all ſorts of trees and pleaſant flowers: moreouer it was inuironed with many great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, which watered it on all parts. And becauſe that once the King (being there on hunting with the Queene) ſeeing that his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tooke great pleaſure in the place, hee beſtowed it vpon her, and afterwards ſhe cauſed a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But that I may not degreſſe ouer farre from my firſt diſcourſe, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> according as ſhe had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, came and demanded leaue of the King and Queene for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, the which was eaſily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto her: and therefore ſhee purpoſed to depart the next day very earely in the morning. And becauſe that <hi>Galaor</hi> and his co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of mine, vpon this condition, that if he be ouercome he will redouble the tribute which I doe demand of him, otherwiſe he will hence-forth remaine free and acquitted, the which I haue condiſcended vnto. So my friends, I doe moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreat you, euen as you loue mee, not to forſake mee in this my greateſt neede, knowing aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that my enemies are ſtrong, and determined to worke my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, but by your good helpe and the right that we haue, we ſhal eaſily ouercome them, then ſhall you goe ſeeke out <hi>Amadis,</hi> as you haue determined, and you ſhall take as many of my knights with you as you pleaſe. When they heard this requeſt which the King did make vnto them, there was not any amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to obey him, ſeeing his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſo great, although that thereby the queſt of <hi>Amadis</hi> was delaied: and at the ſame inſtant they promiſed not to forſake him.

After-wards hauing ſome-what eaſed their hearts with their exceeding teares, <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſpake firſt, ſaying vnto <hi>Mabila:</hi> Alas Madame, what wrong hath <hi>Oriana</hi> offered, not onely to you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

anſwered <hi>Mabila,</hi> (thinking to ſpeake for the aduantage of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis)</hi> was the occaſion of all this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. Then ſhe recited vnto him at large, the whole diſcourſe of the three peeces of the ſword, as you haue heard in the firſt booke. And aſſure thee <hi>Gandalin,</hi> ſaid ſhe, that neither the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> nor I, were euer able to driue it from the fantaſie of <hi>Oriana,</hi> but that ſhe was forſaken by him, ſo as ſhee ſtill perceiuing that ſhee was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traried by the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi> and me, did hide her ſelfe from vs, and vnawares to vs both ſhe wrot vnto him, that vnhappy letter which <hi>Durin</hi> did bring him, by the which is ſprung the whole ſourſe of this miſchiefe. Whereof ſhee hath ſince that time, often e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough repented her: for from the firſt houre that ſhe did heare of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> his loſſe, ſhee hath receiued ſo great ſorrow and griefe, that it is impoſſible to receiue any more: and neuertheleſſe, we haue been in a manner very glad of her puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing that ſhe hath not yet feared to procure his diſpleaſure, that of her hath ſo well deſerued. All this diſcourſe did <hi>Oriana</hi> heare, who was in her wardrobe: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that they had changed their talke, ſhee came forth as if ſhe had heard nothing at all. And as ſhee would haue ſpoken vnto <hi>Gandalin,</hi> the teares diſtilled from her eyes, and ſhe began to tremble ſo extreamely, that ſhe fell downe all along vpon the floore, crying. Gentle <hi>Gandalin,</hi> if thou art the ſame that thou ſhouldeſt be vnto thy maiſter, reuenge vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me forth-with, the greate miſerie which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly he endureth.

And be you aſſured that ſeeing the Damoſel of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> hath vndertaken the charge to finde him, that ſhe will ſooner accompliſh the ſame, then all the perſons in the world beſide: for I do not thinke (ſeeing hee did hide himſelfe from me) that it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer poſſible for any other but ſhee to finde him out.

In good faith, ſaid <hi>Gandalin,</hi> it is well and wiſely aduiſed. Then the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe deliuered him the keyes, and without any longer ſtaying in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refleur</hi> he returned to <hi>London,</hi> where he executed his commiſſion ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, that the next morning he came vnto <hi>Mabila,</hi> vnto whom he deliuered the counterfeit keyes, who ſhewed them ſtraight vnto <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> ſaying vnto her: behold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a good beginning, for the recompencing of the hurt which you procured vnto your <hi>Amadis.</hi> Mine? anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> I would to God he were here.

Let vs go then garded: for I will hence forth thinke me ſafe being to be garded by you, who are ſo valiant in deeds of armes. Seeing that you knowe me ſo well, anſwered <hi>Mabila,</hi> let vs march on boldly, and you ſhall ſee how I will finiſh this aduenture: wherein if I faile, I ſweare that for one whole yeere, I will neither hang ſhield about my necke, nor ſtrike one ſtroke with the Launce. Heere with all they began to laugh ſo loude, that they might haue bin heard very eaſily, and at the ſame inſtant they came vnto the dore, where they tried the firſt key, which they found maruailous fit, and the ſecond alſo, wherefore they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them without any difficultie, and entered into the Orchard. Then ſayde <hi>Oriana</hi> vnto <hi>Mabila:</hi> Coſin all that wee haue done is to no end, except ſome-what more be done: how may your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin returne when wee once haue brought him into the place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the height of the wals? I haue already thought vpon that, anſwered ſhe, it ſhall be very eaſie for him by the corner of this wall, againſt the which wee will ſet by this peece of timber, and with the ſame and our helpe together, hee may eaſily mount vp to the top thereof: but it behooueth that the chiefeſt helpe come from you, for you onely reape the commoditie thereof. Wee ſhall ſee what will happen, ſayde <hi>Oriana,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for this time let vs depart, and goe to ſleepe, the which they did. And as they laid them downe in their bed, <hi>Mabila</hi> embracing <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> ſaide vnto her. Madame, I would that the knight for whome you attempt ſo many fair enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, were now in my place, vpon this condition, that I did goe to ſleepe elſe-where, becauſe I would heare none of your complaints, for the harme that hee might doe vnto you.

And ſo long they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued this pleaſant diſcourſe, that loue ſtinged them ſo vehemently, as euery amorous Reader may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine what they wanted, to cauſe them ſleep till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that they went to hear diuine ſeruice: and at their returne they found that <hi>Gandalin</hi> was already come from <hi>London,</hi> whom they led with them into the garden, where they told him how they had tryed the keyes, and what words <hi>Mabila</hi> had vſed in the prooning of them. By my faith Madame, anſwered he, you do now put me in minde of ſome iniurious ſpeech that I vſed of you vnto my Lord, thinking thereby to haue comforted him, but there with all he had thought to haue taken my head fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſhortly after I did abide

When the King had long giuen eare vnto him (to ſhew that he made ſmall account of ſuch threats) he ſmiling thereat, anſwered him. Truſt mee Knight, they that gaue thee this commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doe thinke farre amiſſe of me, for I haue all my life time thought a dangerous warre, better then a ſhamefull peace, becauſe I were worthy of great reprehenſion, both of God and man, being King ouer ſuch a mighty nation, if I ſhould now through baſe cowardiſe, ſuffer them to bee afflicted with cruelty. Wherefore returne and tell them, that I had rather deſire all the daies of my life, that warre which they do threaten me withall, and in the end to die in battaile, then to accord vnto a peace ſo much to my diſhonor. And becauſe that I deſire to know their mind at large, I will ſend a Knight of mine owne with you, who ſhall in like ſort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto them my whole intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet I know not if by their lawes all Embaſſadors or meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are as free from danger with them, as they are with Chriſtian Princes. If it pleaſe your Maieſtie, ſaid the knight, that he ſhal go with me, I will bee his warrant, and will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct him vnto the burning lake, which is in the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza,</hi> where they are aſſembled with the reſt of the hundred, to come and meet with you: aſſuring you that whereſoeuer <hi>Don Quedragant</hi> abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, he will neuer ſuffer wrong to be done vnto any. Truely anſwered the King, hee ſheweth himſelfe therein to bee a noble Prince: but tell mee, if it pleaſe you, what your name is.

One day the Queene being talking with <hi>Oaiana, Mabila</hi> and <hi>Olinda (Amadis</hi> comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her chamber) ſhee called her daughter <hi>Leonor,</hi> and ſaide vnto her: that ſhe ſhould Princely goe, and requeſt <hi>Amadis</hi> to bee her knight, and that from thenceforth he ſhould ſerue her, without bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring affection to any other but to her. The little Princeſſe thinking that her mother did ſpeake in good earneſt, did riſe vp, &amp; with a good grace came and made this requeſt vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> whereupon all the Ladies and Gentlewomen began to laugh. But <hi>Amadis</hi> taking her vp in his armes, ſaid vnto her. My lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Lady, if you will haue me to be your Knight, beſtow ſome pretty fauour vpon me in token that you are my Miſtreſſe, and that I am your ſeruant. I haue nothing, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhee, but this carquent of gold that I were vpon my head. The which ſhe ſuddainly vntied &amp; gaue it vnto him, wherewithal eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one againe began to laugh, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>rely ſhee beleeued the words of <hi>Amadis,</hi> who for her ſake did make this ſong. And the ſame did <hi>Leonor</hi> and her playfellowes ſing, as you haue heard, the which did greatly delight all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: which being ended, they made a lowly obeiſance, &amp; returned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place where the Queen ſate. Then the king tooke <hi>Galaor, Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> and <hi>Agraies</hi> apart, who were deſiring leaue of his Maſtiſtie to accompany <hi>Coriſanda</hi> ſome part of her way, and he ſaid vnto them: My friends you are the three perſons of the worlde, vpon whome I doe chiefly rely. You know the battaile that I haue agreed vnto with King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> which is to be performed in the firſt weeke of the moneth of Auguſt: wherein wee ſhall finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs many ſtrong Giants, who are bloudy people, &amp; full of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Wherefore I pray you not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Moſt royall King, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> there is no neede to vſe either prayer or commandement vnto vs, to perſwade vs to bee in a place ſo famous: for although wee had not at all any ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as we haue to ſerue your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, yet the deſire to fight againſt ſuch perſonages, ſhould neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe not bee diminiſhed in vs, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is the onely duty of all good Knights, to hazard them-ſelues in ſuch enterpriſes, where they may gaine honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.

Therefore your Maieſty may be aſſured that our returne hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall bee very ſhortly, and in the meane ſeaſon you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate this matter vnto the reſt of your knights, to incourage and to confirm them in the ſame good will that now they haue to ſerue your Maieſty, the which counſell the King liked well of, and there-withall hee gaue them leaue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. Thus they went together in the conduct of <hi>Coriſanda,</hi> as I haue already recited.

Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſhe began to weepe, &amp; with a deepe ſigh, ſhe ſayd. Ah fortune why doeſt thou not yet permit me to beholde my Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> one onely day? I beſeech thee either to grant me this good, or to ſpare my life no longer, becauſe my ſoule doth loath it. Herewithall ſhee became ſo ſad, that it greatly pittied <hi>Gandalin</hi> to beholde her, who notwithſtanding diſſembling his griefe, faigning not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this talke, anſwered her: Madame you muſt not bee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded if henceforth I come no more in your preſence: for I did alwaies hope that my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> would haue returned hither againe very ſhortly, and now hearing you in theſe tearmes. I am quite depriued of this benefit. I pray thee good friend <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſayd ſhee, be not angry. I ſwear to thee by my faith, that if I could looke with a merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er countenance, I would willingly dot it but I cannot otherwiſe do: for my heart yet remaining in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall heauineſſe, will in no ſort permit me, and were it not for the conſolation which thou haſt giuen me, I aſſure thee that I ſhould not haue the power to ſtand vpon my feet, ſo much doe I feele my ſelfe grieued with this warre that my father hath vndertaken, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe whereof I doe exceedingly feare, by reaſon of thy Maſter his abſence.

Then feare &amp; hope ſeaſed vpon the Princeſſe heart, in ſuch ſort, that without power to anſwer one worde, ſhee
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7179:174"/>
began to tremble, the which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bila</hi> perceiuing, ſhe anſwered the Gentlewoman: friend will her to come in hither all alone. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman returned to performe her charge, but in the meane time beleeue mee, neither <hi>Mabila</hi> nor <hi>Gandalin</hi> knew how to behaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, beeing either hopeleſſe of the good, or fearefull of the bad newes that the Damoſell of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi> might bring. Who ſhortly after entered in with the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a perſon more pleaſant then penſiue: and after her duty done vnto <hi>Oriana,</hi> ſhee preſented her with a Letter from <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſaying vnto her: Madame, my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> recommendeth him muſt hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly vnto your good grace, whom I haue found, as this Letter (written with his owne hand) will aſſure you. <hi>Oriana</hi> receiued the Letter, and as ſhe thought to haue opened it, her ſpirit was ſo raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with exceeding ioy, as all the parts of her body remained with-out any power, or ability once to moue or ſtirre, becauſe they would ſupply no other office, but to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate in this moſt happy newes: ſo that <hi>Oriana</hi> therewithall fell down in the place where ſhe ſtood. But very ſuddenly ſhee was raiſed vp againe, &amp; ſhe opened the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein ſhee found the ring that ſhe ſent vnto <hi>Amadis</hi> by <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> at the ſame time that hee fought with <hi>Dardan</hi> at <hi>Winſore,</hi> which ſhe preſently knew. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in kiſſing it ſhee ſayd ſo loud that ſhe might eaſily be heard: O ring diuinely kept, bleſſed be hee, that euer did make thee ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, giuing from hand to hand all the pleaſure that may bee deſired, then put ſhe it vpon her finger, and beganne to reade the Letter. And when ſhe beheld the ſweet words that <hi>Amadis</hi> vſed, &amp; the the thanks that he did yeeld vnto her, for the careful remembrance that ſhe had of him, by the which he was raiſed from death to life, there was neuer any woman more ioyfull, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting her eyes vp to heauen, ſhee ſaid: O God of heauen and earth, creator of all things, praiſed be thy holy name, becauſe thou haſt vouchſafed in mercy to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon mee, by the diligence of this Gentlewoman. Herewithall ſhee withdrew her ſelfe apart and tooke the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> by the hand, ſaying vnto her: I pray you faire Lady tel me how you did find him, how long you haue bin toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the place where you haue left him. By my faith Madam anſwe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red the Damoſell, after my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from you, I ariued in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where I remained certaine dayes without hearing any news of him, by meanes whereof (beeing as it were voide of hope to ſatisfie your deſire) I tooke ſhipping intending to returne vnto you: but wee had ſo ſore a tempeſt vpon the Sea, that mauger all our Mariners, the ſhip was driuen vnto the poore Rocke, where my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remained. Whom at the firſt fight we did not know, for he was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in name, habite, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and hee was likely to haue died in our preſence, when in a manner hee was not ſuccoured by any of vs. Notwithſtanding in the end I was ware of a wound that he had vpon the face, the which was heretofore giuen vnto him by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus,</hi> wherby I ſtill ſuſpected that it ſhould be he, and in the end hee manifeſted himſelfe vnto me. And continuing her diſcourſe, ſhee recited wholly all that which you haue heard in the beginning of this Hiſtory. Then loue &amp; pitty aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7179:174"/>
the heart of the Princeſſe, in ſo ſtrange a manner, that ſhe entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Gentlewoman to ſpeake no more of the troubles of <hi>Amadis:</hi> but onely to tell her how hee did at that preſent. Madame, anſwered ſhee, I haue left him in the Forreſt, ſtaying to heare ſome newes from you. And how may wee ſecretly ſend vnto him, ſaide <hi>Oriana:</hi> for if you returne vnto him ſo ſuddainly, there might ſome matter bee ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. For the ſame occaſion, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the damoſel, I haue brought with me <hi>Durin,</hi> whome I will ſend back when it ſhall pleaſe you, fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that I haue forgot parte of the preſents that I brought vnto <hi>Mabila.</hi> It is very well aduiſed, ſaid the Princeſſe. Afterwards ſhee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto her, how <hi>Coriſanda</hi> gaue vnto them the firſt hope that <hi>Amadis</hi> was not dead, and that hee it was that named himſelfe the <hi>Faire Forlorne.</hi> It is true, anſwered the Damoſell, and hee is yet ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, neither is hee determined to change his name, vntill hee haue firſt ſeene you, except you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him the contrary. That ſhall then be very ſhortly, ſaide <hi>Oriana,</hi> for his coſin and I haue taken ſuch order, that hee may come hither when it ſhal pleaſe him and not be perceiued by any body. We haue the key of this garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (by the which the way ſhal be eaſie and ſecret for him) the which wee will ſend vnto him by <hi>Durin,</hi> therefore call him vnto vs, to tell him what <hi>Amadis</hi> muſt doe at his hither arriuall. Hereupon <hi>Durin</hi> came vnto them, &amp; <hi>Oriana</hi> ſhewing him the garden, ſaid vnto him. <hi>Durin</hi> doeſt thou ſee this orchard, <hi>Amadis</hi> muſt enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ouer the corner of this wall, &amp; when hee is once in, heere are the keyes of the dore thorow which he muſt come vnto vs, the which thou ſhalt carry vnto him, and ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aduertiſe him, whatſoeuer thy ſiſter ſhall tell thee in my behalfe. Which ſaid, ſhe departed leauing them together, and as ſoone as ſhe was entred into a great Hall, ſhee forthwith ſent vnto the Damoſell, willing her to bring thoſe preſents which the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queene had ſent vnto her &amp; <hi>Mabila,</hi> the which ſhe did. But as ſhee vnfolded the cloh wherein they were wrapped, (as if ſhee had ſuddainly bethought her ſelfe) ſhe cried. Alas Madam, I haue left the tokens that were ſent vnto <hi>Mabila,</hi> there as we did lie the laſt night, and if <hi>Durin</hi> do not ſpeedily returne, they may be in dangar to be loſt: now <hi>Durin</hi> knew the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter well enough, and therefore hee made as though hee were vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and on the other ſide, <hi>Mabila</hi> faining to be very angry, ſaid vnto him: <hi>Durin</hi> my good friend, will you do me this pleaſure, to returne and fetch that which your ſiſter hath forgotten? Madam, anſwered he, I will do whatſoeuer you ſhall pleaſe, but by my faith, I could bee very well content, that it would pleaſe you to appoint ſome other to doe it, becauſe of the toyle that we haue indured in our weariſome iourney. My friend, ſaid ſhe, I pray thee do ſo much for me, &amp; be thou ſure that I wil reward thee: in good ſooth, ſaide <hi>Oriana,</hi> it were greate reaſon ſo to doe, I vnderſtand you well enough, anſwered <hi>Durin,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you mocke mee. At this word they all began to laugh, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the counterfait diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment that he made to returne back. Well goe to, ſaid hee, ſeeing that I muſt beare this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7179:175"/>
afterwards he departed to returne vnto the Abbie where <hi>Amadis</hi> remayned expecting newes from <hi>Oriana.</hi> Neuertheleſſe before hee departed, <hi>Gandalin</hi> willed him to tell <hi>Euil</hi> his Coſen, that he ſhould endeauour himſelfe to ſerue the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> diligently, and that whileſt he remayned with him, hee ſhould likewiſe enquire after ſome newes of <hi>Amadis:</hi> and this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage did <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſend vnto him, to cauſe him the leſſe to ſuſpect him in whoſe ſeruice hee remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that <hi>Amadis</hi> might the more ſecretly bring his matter to paſſe.</p>

                  <p>Then the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> with-out further enquiring tooke <hi>Durin</hi> apart, who did wholly recite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him all that which he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to tell him on the behalfe of <hi>Oriana,</hi> and how ſhee ſtayed for him at <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> being very well determined to giue him kind entertainement: likewiſe what order was taken for his ſecret comming and going, when and as often as hee pleaſed, and alſo how his brethren <hi>Galaor, Floreſtan,</hi> and <hi>Agraies</hi> his Coſen, remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the Court, expecting the battaile that is to bee performed very ſhortly, betweene King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart,</hi> and <hi>Cildadan</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the challenge of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate that <hi>Famongomad</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gyants and knights had ſent vnto the King, if hee would not giue <hi>Oriana</hi> to be a waiting maide vnto <hi>Madaſima,</hi> and to be marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhortly after to <hi>Baſigant</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſonne to the ſayde <hi>Famon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomad.</hi> When the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> heard this diſcourſe, his heart
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7179:175"/>
was ready to breake with extream rage: purpoſing with himſelfe, that the firſt enterpriſe that hee would vndertake (after hee had ſeene his Lady) ſhould be to finde out <hi>Famongomad,</hi> and to fight with him, for the iniury that hee would doe vnto <hi>Oriana.</hi> After that <hi>Durin</hi> had thoroughly aduertiſed him of all that hee had in charge, hee tooke leaue of him to returne vnto <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> leauing him in the Abbie, fully determined from thenceforth to abate the pride of theſe Gyants: beeing glad not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in that hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the good fauour &amp; grace of <hi>Oriana,</hi> on whom his life and honour did wholly depend. Then the next morning before the breake of day, he armed him with the ſame Armour that <hi>Enil</hi> had brought, and mounting on horſe-backe, hee tooke the way towardes <hi>Mirefleur:</hi> but hee had not rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den farre, (thinking vpon the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that was promiſed vnto him, and knowing how neere hee was vnto it) when making a carreer he beganne to curuet and mannage his horſe ſo gallantly, that <hi>Enil</hi> was greatly amazed thereat, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that hee had neuer beene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then an Hermite, and he ſaid vnto him: my Lord, vntill I may iudge of the effect and force of your courage, I may very well ſay that I did neuer ſee a more expert knight, nor one that can doe more with a horſe then you. <hi>Enil,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> it is the valiant hearts of men, not their outward ſhew, that doth accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh haughty deedes and hardy enterpriſes, therefore thou hauing ſaid thy mind by my countenance, mayeſt iudge hereafter of my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage according as I ſhall deſerue, thou and diſcerne.</p>
                  <p>Thus rode the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> all the day long diſcourſing with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nil</hi> of diuerſe pleaſant matters, for thoſe gloomy cloudes which in times paſt had ouer-ſhadowed his thoughts, were now ouer-blowne, and the deſire to beholde her by whom hee liued, ſhined on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his minde. But when it grew to bee ſomewhat late, hee lodged in the houſe of an ancient knight, that both gaue him kinde enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynement and great cheere: ne-uertheleſſe the next morning hee departed. And becauſe he would not be knowne at any time, at his departure from his lodging hee put his helmet vpon his head, ne-uer putting it off but when hee tooke his reſt, and hee did ride from that time forth ſeauen dayes together without finding any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, vntill vpon the eight day following, hee arriued at the foot of a mountaine, and hee did ſee comming towardes him along a path, a knight mounted vpon a mighty courſer, who ſeemed ſo great and ſo ſtrongly made that hee was almoſt like a Gyant. Who comming ſomewhat neere, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto the <hi>Faire Forlorne:</hi> knight I forbid you to paſſe this way, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you doe firſt tell mee that which I deſire to knowe.

                     <hi>Oriana</hi> had ſent vnto him by <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin:</hi> and hee greatly feared ſuch a let, knowing that <hi>Quedragant</hi> was one of the beſt knights in the world: neuertheleſſe hee made himſelfe ready for the Iouſt. The which <hi>Enil</hi> perceiuing, hee ſayde vnto him: my Lord I beleeue that you will combate this Diuell. Hee is no Diuell, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> but one of the ſtrongeſt knights I knowe, of whom I haue heretofore heard great commendation. Then <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragant</hi> drew neere and ſayde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: Knight, you muſt tell me whether you belong vnto King <hi>Liſuart</hi> or not. Why ſo ſayd the <hi>Faire Forlorne.</hi> Becauſe ſayde he, that I am mortall enemy to him and all his, and when I ſhall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowe or meete with any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I will cauſe them to die an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill death if I may.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> was ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enflamed with rage to heare him thus to menace, eſpecially the King and all his Knights, that hee anſwered <hi>Quedragant:</hi> You then are one of them that haue defied that good King? I am euen the ſame ſayde hee, that will doe all the iniurie that poſſibly may bee done both to him and his. And how are you called? anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Faire Forlorne. Don Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragant</hi> ſayde hee. Truſt me <hi>Don Quedragant</hi> anſwered the <hi>Fair For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne,</hi> although you are a valiant Knight and deſcended of a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all linnage, yet haue you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed an exceeding great folly, in defying thus the moſt mighty and beſt King in the worlde: for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſcreete knight ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt no more then hee may well effect, ſeeing that they who doe once paſſe the bonds of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and power, are to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted more haire-braind then hardy, and more vaine-glorious then valiant, the which is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then folly. As for mee I am no ſubiect but rather a ſtraunger vnto the King againſt whom your quarrell is: yet haue I alwaies had a deſire to doe him what ſeruice I could, and therefore you may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count mee of the number of thoſe whom you doe defie, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with mee if you liſt, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe followe on your way. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue mee ſayde <hi>Quedragant,</hi> I thinke the little experience you haue of mee, maketh you to vtter theſe braues: notwithſtanding I would very willingly know your name. I am called anſwered hee, the <hi>Faire Forlorne:</hi> but I thinke for the ſmall renowne that yet is blaſed abroade of mee, you doe now knowe mee as well as you did before. And although I am a ſtraunger, yet haue I heard that you doe ſeeke <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule:</hi> neuertheleſſe I beleeue it were moſt for your profit, not to meete with him, conſidering but what I haue heard reported of him. What ſayd <hi>Quedragant,</hi> doſt thou thinke better of him (vnto whom I doe wiſh ſo much hurt) then of mee? Truſt mee thou ſhalt repent it, therefore defend thee if thy heart will ſuffer thee. Although (anſwered the <hi>Faire Forlorne)</hi> that againſt another I would haue bin content for this time to haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed mee from the combate, yet will I very gladly vndertake it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, for the threatnings &amp; preſumptions that you doe offer vnto me.</p>
                  <p>This ſayd, they ran one againſt the other with ſo great force that the horſe of the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> was likely to haue kiſt the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with his noſe, &amp; himſelfe was wounded
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7179:176"/>
in the right breaſt with the ſhiuer of a Launce, and <hi>Don Quedragant</hi> vnhorſed and wounded betweene the ribbes. Yet hee roſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine lightly, and drew his ſword running againſt the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> whom hee tooke vpon a ſudden whileſt that hee was buſie in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ſetting his helmet right: and before that hee was aware, <hi>Quedragant</hi> ſlew his horſe vnder him, but the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> feeling him to founder, alighted downe. Then hee being exceedingly vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſo vilde a part, hee ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Quedragant:</hi> knight, it ſeemeth that you haue neuer done any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant deeds of armes, in that you haue ſo villainouſly ſlaine my horſe, it might haue ſufficed you to haue wreaked your anger on mee, and not vpon a poore beaſt. Neuertheleſſe I am in good hope that the wrong which you haue done both to him and mee ſhall redound vpon your owne head. <hi>Don Quedragant</hi> anſwered him not one word, but couering him with his ſhield, he came and layd at the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> who in a ſhort time made him feele how well hee could repay whatſoeuer was lent vnto him: and to heare them fight, one would haue iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that more then tenne knights had been fighting together. Then ioyned they ſo cloſe that they left their weapons, and fell to wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, endeauouring to throw one another downe, but that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them: wherefore they let goe their holde, and with-out any breathing, they betooke them againe to their blades, and layd loade one vpon the other ſo couragiouſly, that their Eſquires beholding that cruell combate, did thinke it impoſſible but that they ſhould both twaine die by the hands of each other.</p>
                  <p>And thus they continued from three of the clocke in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone vntill it grewe towardes night, without either reſting them or ſpeaking together: but euen at the ſame inſtant <hi>Don Quedragant</hi> was ſo wearie and faint, that his heart failed him, and he fell downe in this place. By meanes where-of the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> ſtepped vnto him, &amp; as hee pulled off his helme to ſtrike off his head, <hi>Quedragant</hi> taking ayre beganne to breath: the which the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing (although hee was ready to performe with his arme, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge that he meant to take of his enemy) hee ſtayed his blow, the ſworde being ready to lop off any limme vpon the which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe it might chaunce to light: and hee ſayde vnto <hi>Quedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,</hi> it is hight time for thee to think vpon the health of thy ſoule, for thou art but a dead man. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Quedragant</hi> perceiued that he was in ſuch daunger, hee was ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that hee anſwered vnto the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> Alas if I muſt die, yet at the leaſt let mee firſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</p>
                  <p>If thou wilt liue any longer ſaid the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> yeelde thy ſelfe vanquiſhed, and promiſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all that I ſhall commaund thee. I will willingly fulfill what-ſoeuer ſhall pleaſe you, anſwered <hi>Don Quedragant,</hi> although I am not vanquiſhed: for hee is not ouercome that without ſhewing one iot of cowardiſe, hath defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his quarrell euen with the loſſe of his breath, and vntill that he did fall at his enemies feet: but he onely is ouercome, that for want of heart, feareth to doe what he may. Truely ſaid the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne</hi> you ſpeake the very truth, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7179:177"/>
I am very glad that I haue learned ſo much of you. Goe to, ſweare to me the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to obey my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement. The which <hi>Quedragant</hi> did. But the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> called his Eſquires to witneſſe, and then ſayd: I will that at your departure from hence, you goe vnto the Court of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> from whence you ſhal not depart, vntill the ſame <hi>Amadis</hi> (that you ſeeke bee there arriued. Then you ſhall yeelde your ſelfe vnto his mercy, pardoning him for the death of your brother King <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for that as I haue heard, they both of their owne free will challenged each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had Combate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo as this reuenge ought not to bee purſued. Moreouer I will that you giue ouer the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge that you haue made againſt the King, and thoſe that ſerue him, without bearing armes heereafter againſt any one of them. All which conditions <hi>Quedragant</hi> promiſed to performe, although it was to his great griefe. Then he commanded his Eſquires to prepare a litter for him, to carry him vnto <hi>London,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe. In like ſort the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> hauing ſeazed vpon the horſe of <hi>Quedragant,</hi> in ſtead of his owne that was dead, deliuered his ſhield vnto <hi>Enil,</hi> and followed on his way: vpon the which hee behelde foure young Gentlewomen that were flying with a Marlin, who had both ſeene the Combate, and heard all the talke of the two Knights: and for the ſame cauſe, they ſpake vnto the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> earneſtly entreating to come and lodge in their Caſtle, where hee ſhould bee entertained with all the honor that might bee deuiſed, for King <hi>Liſuart</hi> his ſake, vnto whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice hee had ſhewed himſelfe ſo affectionate. The which offer of theirs hee refuſed not, for hee was weary with the great trauail he had ſuſtained al the day. And as ſoon as he was come into his lodging, they themſelues vnarmed him, to ſee if hee were in any ſort dangerouſly wounded: but hee had no other hurt than that vpon his breſt, which was a matter of nothing. Three whole daies together did the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> tarry there, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, riding all day long with-out finding any aduenture: and the night following he lodged in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Inne that ſtood on the way, from whence he departed the next morning very early, and about mid-day hee came vnto the top of a ſmall hill, from whence he might behold the citty of <hi>London,</hi> and the caſtle of <hi>Mireflear,</hi> where his Lady <hi>Oriana</hi> remained.</p>
                  <p>Heerewithall he was ſurpriſed with exceeding ioy: neuertheleſſe, hee fained as though he knew not the Countrey where hee remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and demanded of <hi>Enil</hi> if he did know it. Yea very well, my Lord, anſwered <hi>Enil,</hi> beholde yonder is the citie of <hi>London</hi> where King <hi>Liſuart</hi> at this preſent remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. In faith, ſaide the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne,</hi> I would be very ſorty that either he or any other ſhould know mee, vntill my deedes deſerue it, and that by my deedes of Armes I might be thought worthy to be in ſuch an aſſembly. Therefore goe thou to ſee the Eſquire <hi>Gandalin,</hi> from whom <hi>Durin</hi> did of late bring the commendations: and ſee that thou doeſt wiſely enquire what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one ſaith of me, as lſo when the battaile of King <hi>Cildadan</hi> ſhall be performed. What? anſwered <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nil,</hi> ſhall I leaue you all alone? Care not thou for that, ſayd he, I haue beene many times accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7179:177"/>
to go in that ſort: yet before that thou doeſt depart, let vs eſpy together a fit place where thou maiſt find me at thy returne. Then they rode on a little further, when vpon a ſudden they beheld cloſe by the fide of a riuer two pauilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons armed, &amp; in the midſt of them a moſt faire tent. Before the which were many knights &amp; Ladies ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ten other knights armed for their guard: and there was ne-uer a pauillion that had not fiue ſhields hanged vp, and as many Lances ſtanding before it. Here-withall the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> fearing to bee diſturbed of his enterpriſe, would auoid the combate &amp; took his way vpon the left hand. The which the knights perceiuing, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto him, ſaying, that he muſt needes giue one ſtroke with the Launce for the loue of the Ladies. But he anſwered them that at that inſtant hee had no deſire the reun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For ſayd he, you are freſh and many, and I alone, and very wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Beleeue me ſayd one of them, I thinke rather that you feare to loſe your horſe. And why ſhould I loſe him ſayd the <hi>Faire Forlorne.</hi> Becauſe ſayd the knight, hee muſt haue him that doth throwe you downe, &amp; I am ſure that your loſſe were more certaine then the gaine that you ſhould get vpon vs. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſo, anſwered hee, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depart, then come into any ſuch danger, which ſaid, he paſſed on. Truly ſayd the knights, in our iudgements your armes are defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more with faire wordes then valiant deeds, ſo that they may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee ſound enough to place o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your Tombe when you are dead, yea although you ſhould liue one hundred yeares and more. You may thinke of mee what you pleaſe anſwered the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> yet cannot that in any ſort demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh my reputation. I would it were your pleaſure, ſayd one that ſtepped ſomewhat before his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that you would breake one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one ſtaffe with mee, I would be accounted a traytor, or not in one whole yeare to mount vpon a horſe, if you departed not by and by to ſeeke your lodging without yours. Sir anſwered hee, it is that which I doe feare, and which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mee to turue out of the high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>way. At this they all began to laugh, and to ſcoffe him ſaying, behold the valiant champion, that ſpareth himſelfe againſt a battaile: yet for all this the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> made no account, but followed on his way vntill he came vnto a riuer ſide, but as hee would haue paſſed ouer, he heard a voyce that cryed: ſtay knight, ſtay. Then he turned his head and looked backe to ſee who it was, and perceiued a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, in very good order mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vpon a Palfrey comming towardes him, who at her arriuall ſaid vnto him, <hi>Leonor</hi> daughter to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> together with her Gentlewomen, doe all deſire you to maintain the Iouſts againſt theſe knights, and to ſhew that you will doe ſomethign for the Ioue of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. How? anſwered hee, the daughter of the King, is ſhe there? I truely anſwered the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Beleeue me ſayde the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> I ſhould be very ſory to haue a quarrell with any of her knights, for ſooner would I doe them ſeruice for the honour of ſo faire a Lady. Notwithſtanding ſeeing that it is her pleaſure that I ſhould otherwiſe do, I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent: vpon this condition, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no more then the Iouſt only. Hereupon he tooke his ſhield, and Lance, and rode ſtraight vnto the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7179:178"/>
pauillions, and the Gentlewoman rode before to aduertiſe the knights thereof. Wherefore it was not long before that hee who firſt of all had threatned the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne</hi> that hee would make him to loſe his horſe, offered himſelfe to run the firſt courſe, whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently did know, for hee did very wel marked him, when he gybed at him, and he was very glad that he had ſo good an occaſion to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged. Therefore they couched one againſt the other, ſetting ſpurs vnto their horſes, meeting with ſo great an incounter that the knight broke his ſtaffe to ſhiuers, and the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> hit him ſo rudely, that hee ouerthrewe him to the ground, and hee brake one of his thighes with three of his ribs, with the griefe whereof hee remayned quite aſtoniſhed. In the meane ſeaſon <hi>Enil</hi> ran to take his horſe, &amp; the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> turned vnto him that he had ouerthrown to whom he ſaid, Knight if you keepe your worde you muſt not in one whole yeare come vpon any horſebacke, the which you did promiſe if you could not win mine. So ſaying, he heard that another knight cried vnto him: knight keepe thee from me. Wherefore he left the other, and putting his Lance in the reſt, he clapt his ſpurres to his horſe, &amp; ran on ſo rightly againſt him that had challenged him, that hee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſed him euen as hee had done the firſt, and as much did he vnto the third and fourth, before his Launce did breake: whoſe horſes he cauſed to be taken, and tyed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a tree. Then he would haue bin gone, when <hi>Enil</hi> (who had ſeene that another knight did make him ready) ſaid vnto him, Sir you haue not yet done, behold the fift which which is comming towardes you. Then the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> turned his head, and did ſee a knight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto him who brought foure Launces, who being come ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Sir knight my Lady <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> hauing very well perceiued the valour that you haue ſhewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her knights, and knowing that your Launce is broken, ſhee ſendeth you theſe foure, and ſhee prayeth you that ſo long as they will laſt, not to ſpare them againſt the reſt that may come to reuenge their companions. I moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thank that good Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anſwered he, and I pray you to tell her grace, that for the honor of her, I wil ſo long as I liue do what ſhe ſhalbe pleaſed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand me: but I would neither ſtay, nor come one ſtep forwards for any of theſe knights that remaine, ſo ouer proud haue I found them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayning mee to fight againſt my will, when I would haue paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long on my way.</p>
                  <p>Herewithall hee tooke one of the Launces when very ſuddenly he beheld the fift knight ready to make his courſe againſt him: werefore hee preſently pulled downe his viſor and couching his ſtaffe he ranne againſt him, and he did hit him with ſo great force that hee vnhorſed him, as alſo all the reſt, not breaking his Launce, but onely vpon the laſt who beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himſelfe better then any of the others, for before the <hi>Faire Forlor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> could ouerthrowe him, he made two Launces flie to ſhiuers, but at the third time hee made him to loſe his ſtirrops, and hee fell to the earth. And becauſe hee kept his ſeate better then any of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, I will tell you who it was: his name was <hi>Nicoran de Pont Craintif,</hi> who in thoſe dayes was one of the beſt runners
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7179:178"/>
with a Lance in all the Realme of great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> After that the <hi>Fair Forlorne</hi> had thus ouerthrowne them all, he ſent their horſes vnto the Princeſſe <hi>Leonor,</hi> praying her to aduertiſe her knights that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after they ſhould bee more curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vnto thoſe that paſſe by the way, or elſe that they ſhould learn to ſit faſter on horbacke then they had done: for they might chance to meete with ſuch a knight that would make them go on foote as they deſerued. This meſſage did make the knights ſo much aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that they anſwered not one word: but they were greatly aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed that they were all vnhorſed by him, whom they ſo little eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, neither could they once ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what hee ſhould bee: for his armes were yet vnknowne. And <hi>Nicoran</hi> ſaid, beleeue me if <hi>Amadis</hi> were liuing, I would iudge that it was he, and I know not any other that would ſo haue parted from vs. It is not he anſwered <hi>Galaſa,</hi> for he would neuer haue runne againſt vs that are his friends. Did you not ſee ſayd the other, how he alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the iouſt? Aſſure you it is he and no other. I would it were ſayd <hi>Giontes,</hi> King <hi>Liſuart</hi> his Nephew, our ſhame ſhould then bee the leſſe: but whoſoeuer hee be, God ſhield him from harme. The diuell goe with him anſwered <hi>Laſamor,</hi> he hath broken my thigh, and my ribbes: yet was I the cauſe there-of, being the onely procurer of mine owne hurt, and the firſt that began the combare. In this ſort did the <hi>Faire forlorne</hi> eſcape from them, &amp; went forward on his way, very ioyfull for his good fortune, hauing yet one of the foure Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whole in his hand. Now was it exceeding hot, and he was very dry: and therefore beholding an Hermitage a farre off, he tooke his way thither, as well to giue God thankes for his victorie, as alſo to drinke, if there were any to be had: and when hee came vnto the gate thereof he found three Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Palfrayes ſadled and brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the which two Squires did holde. Then hee alighted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in, where hee did ſee no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Wherefore after that hee had ended his prayers he came forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and hee did ſee the three Gentlewomen, who were refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues by the ſide of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhady fountaine, towards whom he went, and comming vnto them he ſaluted them. They demanded if hee were any of the knights of King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> Gentlewoman an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, I would I were worthy to deſerue ſo good company: but I pray you tell me which way are you going at your departure from hence. The right way to <hi>Mirefleur</hi> ſayd the Gentlewomen, where we ſhall finde our Aunt (who is Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſe of the Moneſtary there) and my Lady <hi>Oriana</hi> King <hi>Liſuart</hi> his daughter. And becauſe the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is hot as you ſee, wee are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſtay here in the coole, and it were not amiſſe if you did as wee doe. Seeing you are ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed anſwered hee, I am content to beare you company: for me thinks this fountaine is a very fit place for one to reſt in, but doe you knowe how it is called? No ſayde they: neuertheleſſe there is another yet more faire in the bottome of this valley, which is called the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of three channels. Herewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they ſhewed him the place, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that he did knowe it better then they, for many times hee had there beene a hunting, and he had already determined that the ſame ſhould bee the place where <hi>Enil</hi>

ſhould finde him at his returne from <hi>London.</hi> And as they were in this ſorte diſcourſing together, they perceiued vpon the ſame way a cart which was drawne with twelue horſes and guided by two Dwarffes, within the which were many armed knights inchained, their ſhields were hanged all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the ſides thereof, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them were Ladies &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen that cryed out, &amp; wept moſt pitifully: before whom mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>hed a Gyant armed with plates of fine ſteele, hauing vpon his head a maruelious bright ſhining helme. But hee ſeemed to bee ſo great, that it would haue feared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man to behold him, &amp; he rode vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a mighty black horſe, holding in his right hand a Bore-ſpeare, the head whereof was more then a cubit in length, and there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (behinde the cart) another Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant farre more monſtrous then the firſt, of whom the Damoſels of the fountaine were ſo much afraid, as they fled to hide them amongſt the buſhes. At the ſame inſtant the Gyant which marched before (ſeeing how the Ladies that were in the cart did teare the hairs from their heads, for it ſeemed by their furious behauiours, that they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willingly would haue procured their owne death) ſayde vnto the Dwarffes, If you cauſe not theſe girles to hold their peace, by Ioue you villaines, I will make a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand peeces of your entrails, for I would haue them charily kept, to ſacrifice them vnto the God that I adore. When the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> heard him, hee preſently knewe that it was <hi>Famongomad,</hi> who was wont to cut off the heads of all thoſe that hee might take, and to ſhed their blood before an Idoll that hee had in the burning lake, by whoſe counſell hee was gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all his affaires, &amp; although hee then had no deſire to fight, as well becauſe he would not faile to be at <hi>Mirefleur</hi> (according as <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> had willed him) as alſo becauſe he was wearie, and tyred with the encounter that he had had againſt the ten knights, yet knowing the perſons that were in the cart, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom was <hi>Leo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

My Lord ſayd he, doe you not ſee theſe diuels that are comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs? For Gods ſake let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone and hide vs from them, then may you arme your ſelfe at eaſe, for I would not tarry their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming for all the wealth in <hi>London.</hi> I will doe better if I may, ſayd the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> I will firſt try my fortune, and although thou doeſt thinke them diuels) thou ſhalt ſee them ſlaine by one onely knight: for their life is ſo odious before God, that hee will giue mee the ſtrength to reuenge (as I hope) all thoſe miſerable cruelties which they from day to day doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>

to doe, yet might they hardly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape with honor. Care not thou for that, anſwered hee, if I ſhould let ſuch an aduenture paſſe before mine eyes, and not bee an actor therein, I were vnworthy euer to come into the company of good and vertuous men, and therefore whatſoeuer may chance thereof, I care not. This ſaid, he left <hi>Euil</hi> wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and went vnto that ſide where he might eaſily beholde <hi>Mirefleur:</hi> becauſe the remembrance of <hi>Oaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> was ſtill preſent before him, and he bagan to ſay. O my Lady and onely hope, neuer did I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe aduenture, aduenture, the which I haue not by your means atchiued: and now that I knowe you are ſo neere vnto mee, and that it is for a thing that ſo much importeth you, forſake mee not I pray you, in this extreamity. Herewithall he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that his ſtrength was redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and ſeeting apart all feare, hee went toward the cart, and ſaid vnto the Dwarffes: ſtay you baſe ſlaues, for you ſhall all die, and your mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters alſo. When the Gyant heard theſe threats, hee entred into ſuch fury, that the ſmoke proceeded from his eyes, in ſuch ſort, as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med they had beene on a fire, and hee did ſhake his bore-ſpeare with ſuch force, that he almoſt doubled both ends together. Then hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the <hi>Faire Forlorne.</hi> Vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and vnfortunate wretch, how durſt thou bee ſo bold to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me? Yet hee made as though he heard him not, but couched his Launce, and ſetting ſpurres to his horſe, he ſmote the Gyant a little beneth the waſt, with ſuch ſtrength, as pearcing the ioynts of his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Launce entred into his tripes with ſuch exceeding force, that paſſing quite through, it hit againſt the hinder part of the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and broke the girts of the horſe, ouerthrowing both man andſaddle euen in a moment. Ne-uertheleſſe before the Gyants fall, he couched his bore ſpeare, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to haue hit the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> but it miſſed him &amp; ſtroke thorow his horſes flankes: wherefore he feeling that hee was wounded to death, did very nimbly alight downe. and although that <hi>Famon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomad</hi> was in like ſort deadly wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with the great rage that hee felt, hee roſe vp, and with both his hands hee pulled forth the troun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon of the Launce that ſtucke in his body, and threw it at the <hi>Faire-Forlorne</hi> with ſuch extreame fury, that hee thought to haue ouer-throwne him, and ſo greatly did he ſtraine himſelfe to hurle the ſame, that the tripes came out of his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and he tumbled ouer and ouer. Therewithall he cried. <hi>Baſigant</hi> my decre fon reuenge the death of thy ſorrowfull Father if thou canſt. At this crye <hi>Baſigant</hi> approched, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a weighty bill, wherewithall hee thought to haue ſtrooken the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> but he ſtepped aſide, and the blow paſſed by ſo forcibly, that if it had hit him it had clouen him quite aſunder. Then the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> being very ready, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, ſtretched forth his arme, and ſtroke the Gyant ſo great a blowe, that hee cut the one halfe of his legge away, although that with the great fury wherein hee remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hee could not as then feele it, but lifted vp his bill, the which turned in his fiſt, which was a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py chance for the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> who receiued the blowe vpon his Shielde, within the which it entered ſo farre, that the Gyant could not pull it forth And as hee ſtruied to get it out, hee rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him vpon his ſtirrops to haue

the more ſtrength. By the meanes where of, the ſinues of his legge, which were cut a ſunder fayled him, wherewithal he felt ſuch great greefe, that (not being able to keep his ſadle) he kiſſed the ground with his noſe: and in falling, the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> ſtroke him another blow vpon his right arme, ſo that he was forced to forſake his bill, and leaue it in the power of his enemy. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his hart was ſo great, that hee roſe vp againe and drew forth his ſword, that was maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous long, with the which he layed at the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> with all his ſtrength, and hee ſtrained himſelfe ſo much, that the blood iſſued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wounds, in ſuch great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that all his ſtrength fayled him, and he fel down together with his blow, which lighted vpon the ſtones, wherewith the ſword brake in two pieces. The which the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> perceiuing, hee ſtepped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and ſet his hands vnto the bill in ſuch ſort, that by force hee pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it out of his ſhield, wherewith he ſtroke ſo great a blow vpon the Giants helmet, that he made it flie from his head: but the Giant with that little remainder of his ſword, that hee yet helde, pared away the top of his helmet, together with a little of the skin and haire of his head, the which blow if he had ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſomewhat lower, hee had cut his head off. Therewithal they that were in the cart, thought that the <hi>Faier Forlorne</hi> had beene wounded to death, and himſelfe was ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that hee thought his dayes to bee ended, wherefore deſiring to bee reuenged, hee gaue him ſuch another great blowe with the bill, that hee cut off his eare, with halfe of his face, with the which he yeelded vp the ghoſt.

Moreouer hee told him, that the King was in great doubt for the battaile which he had enterpriſed againſt king <hi>Cildadan:</hi> for the moſt part of thoſe that hee had to deale withall, were cruell Giants, and without reaſon, and therefore hee had ſtayed <hi>Galaor, Floreſtan, Agrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> and <hi>Don Galuanes,</hi> to aſſiſt him in that encounter. Who (ſaid <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin)</hi> are ſo angry for the famous report that is ſpread abroad, of the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> to the diſprayſe of <hi>Amadis,</hi> as if they had not already paſſed their promiſe to the king, ſeeking not to enterpriſe any combat or voyage before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, they had beene already vpon their way to haue ſought him out to fight with him, and they ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue it out, that if they doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape aliue, they will not reſt vntil they haue both found him, and fought with him. In good faith anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> they ſhall ſee me the ſooner if God pleaſe, but it ſhall be after another manner then they hope for: wherefore do thou returne to the Court, and learne if any thing hath ſince happened. Herewithall <hi>Gandalin</hi> departed, who went directly to <hi>London,</hi> where hee found the king ready to ſit downe to dinner, and euen as they were taking vp the Table, there entred in a very antient Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, attended vpon with two Eſquires, apparrelled both in one liuery. This old mans beard was ſhauen, and the hayre of his head was white with age, who came and knceled before the king, and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in the Greeke tongue (in which countrie he was borne) hee ſaid vnto him. It may pleaſe your Maieſty, the high renowne that is ſpread in all parts of the world, of the knights, Ladies and Gentle-women that are in your Court, hath beene the only cauſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced me to addreſſe my iourney hither, to ſee if in the ſame I may finde that which this threeſcore yeeres I haue ſought in diuerſe countries farre and neere, to ſmall purpoſe.

nor diſpleaſing eyther to your Maieſty, or to any other. Then all the Lords that were preſent, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſee a thing ſo rare, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the king to grant his requeſt, the which he eaſily condiſcended vnto, therewithall the ancient Gentleman tooke from one of his Eſquires, a little cofer of Iaſper, which he did carrie, which was in length about three cubits, and in breadth a ſhaftmont, and it was garniſhed with Gold, and the moſt curious damaske worke in the World: this little cofer he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, afterward he tooke out of it a Sword, ſo ſtrange, as the like was neuer ſeene, the ſcabberd ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was made of two bright ſhining bones, and as greene as any fine Emeraud, ſo as the blade was to be ſeene through it, not after the manner of other blades, for the one halfe of it ſhewed meruailous bright, and the other ſeemed, as if it burned, being as red as fire, and it hanged in a Belt of the ſame ſtuffe as the ſcabberd was of, ſo cunningly made, that any man might eaſily gird it about him. This Sword the Gentleman did hang about his necke, that hee might likewiſe take out of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a kercheif, the one halfe where-of, was be ſet with floures as freſh and greene, as if they had beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then newly gathered: and the other halfe was couered with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther violets, as withered and dry, as if they had beene ten yeeres in the Sun, neuertheleſſe both the one &amp; the other ſeemed to ſpring from one and the ſelfe ſame roote: wherewithal the king being abaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, demanded of him how theſe things might bee. If it like your maieſty anſwered the old man, this ſword cannot bee drawne forth of the ſcabbard, but onely by that knight that amongſt all louers, is the moſt conſtant, and that doth beſt loue his Lady: and as ſoone as hee ſhall haue it in his hands, that part which burneth ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as cleere and bright as the reſt, ſo as the blade ſhall bee all of one colour.

For this cauſe haue I theſe threeſcore yeeres conuinual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſought in many ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries for thoſe by whom I ought to receiue knight-hood, but yet hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I haue trauailed in vaine, &amp; now proſecuting my voyage (in a manner for my laſt refuge) I am come into your Court: imagining that euen as it farre exceedeth the Courts of all other Emperors and kings, ſo I might in like ſort in the ſame find that which in all others I haue failed of. I pray you ſaide the king, let mee know the reaſon why the fire that remaines in the one halfe of this blade, doth not burne the ſcabbard. It may pleaſe your Maieſty, anſwered the olde man, betwixt <hi>Tartaria</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> there is an arme of the Sea which is ſoohot, that the water thereof (beeing meruailous greene) boiles as if it were vpon the fire, and in the ſame there is brought forth a kinde of Serpents more great then <hi>Crocodiles,</hi> the which doe flie very

lightly, by reaſon of their long wings, but they are ſo infectious, that euery one ſhun them ſo much as they poſſible may. Notwith-ſtanding when a man findeth any one of them hee eſteemeth of him as a thing much worth, becauſe they are profitable for diuerſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and theſe Serpents haue a bone that reacheth from the neck to the tayle, the which is ſo great, that vpon the ſame is formed al the whole body which is greene, as you ſee by this ſcabberd, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, for as much as they are bred vp (as I haue ſaid) in this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſea, no heate of any other fire may hurt them. Thus hath your Maieſty heard the ſtrangeneſſe of this ſword, and of the ſcabberd, now I will tell you of the floures of this kertchiefe. In the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of <hi>Tartarie,</hi> there is alſo an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland enuironed with the moſt ſtrange and dangerous gulfe that is in any part of all the Sea.

I beſeech you ſweete loue not to take any heede vnto the feare that a timerous woman may haue in the middeſt of this great wood, but vnto the vertue and valor that remaineth in you.

All the better ſaid the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> wee ſhall then haue no great cauſe of ſtay. Hereupon hee gaue him his ſhield and launce, and without putting off his Helmet at all, they tooke the right way to <hi>London:</hi> the people had already heard that the knight which did ouercome the Giants ſhould come vnto the kings lodging, they ſaid one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: Heauens ſhield the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> from all miſchiefe, for he is worthy of great praiſe, and moſt happy may that Lady thinks her ſelfe, to whom he remaineth a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant. Theſe words might <hi>Oriana</hi> vnderſtand very well, wherewith ſhe was not a little ioyfull, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe was Lady &amp; Miſtris of him, whom ſo many people did both loue &amp; honor: afterward they came and alighted at the Palace: where they found the king, Queen Ladies, and a great number of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7179:186"/>
knights already aſſembled all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a great hal, to make trial who ſhould gaine the old mans Iewels. And as ſoon as they knew of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall of the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> the King roſe vp with his traine to receiue them: wherefore the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> kneeling down would haue kiſſed his hands: but the K. lifted him vp, ſaying vnto him: My good friend, you are moſt hartily welcome hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where you ſhall be as free as you would wiſh, for you haue done as much ſeruice for me, in ſo ſmall a time, as euer any knight perſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med either for King or Prince. The <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> anſwered not one word, but onely bowed himſelfe to his maieſtie in ſigne of thankes: and without ſtepping one foote from <hi>Oriana,</hi> (whom he held by the hand) they came towards the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who did all ſalute them very courteouſly. You may imagine if the young Princeſſe were not now in ſome feare to be diſcouered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch an aſſembly, for the Queene her mother ſtepped vnto her, looking her ſtedfaſtly in the face, although it was couered with alaune, and ſhe faid vnto her. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, I do not know who you are, for to my knowledge I did ne-uer ſee you, neuertheleſſe, for the loue of this knight (in whoſe cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy you are) that hath done the king ſo great ſernice, aſſure you that in this place ſhal be ſhewed vnto you, all the honour and ſeruice that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may bee. For the which the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> humbly thanked her Maieſtie, but <hi>Oriana</hi> without ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one word held her head down continually. Therewithall the king and all his knights withdrew them to one ſide, and the Queene and her Laides to the other. And in the meane time the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne</hi> leading <hi>Oriana</hi> by the hand, came and beſeeched the King, that he and his Lady might remaine in the midſt of the hall, for they were not determined to touch the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, except that all the aſiſtance did firſt miſſe the gaining of them. The which the king did grant vnto him, who did firſt of all take vp the ſword, which was layd vpon the table by the olde Gentleman na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Macandon:</hi> and the King did draw it out one ſhaſtmont and no more. Wherefore <hi>Macandon</hi> ſaid. It may pleaſe your Maieſty, if there bee not found in your Court any, more amorous then you are, I ſhal not depart from hence ſo conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as I hoped to doe. There-withall he took the ſword and laid it again vpon the table, for ſo muſt he doe after euery triall. Then <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> tooke it vp, but yet he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med leſſe then the King did. The which <hi>Floreſtan, Galnanes, Grame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, Brandoinas</hi> and <hi>Landin</hi> ſeeing, they all one after another tryed what they could doe, and yet none of them could vn ſheath it ſo much as <hi>Floreſtan</hi> did, who drew it ſorth a foote and more: but then <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> the penſiue tooke it, and he paſſed <hi>Floreſtan</hi> about halfe a foote, ſo that hee came vnto the middeſt thereof. Truſt me then, ſayde <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candon,</hi> if you did loue but as much againe as you do, the ſword ſhould bee yours. After him there came more then a hundred Knights, who did little or nothing therin, where-upon <hi>Macandon</hi> ieſting with them, called them heretiques in loue. Then <hi>Agraies</hi> who had ſtaied to bee the laſt, beeing ſure (as hee thonght, conſidering the firme loue which hee did bare vnto his Ladie <hi>Olinda)</hi> that the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was ordained for him and on other, ſtepped forth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his Miſtreſſe hee tooke
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7179:187"/>
the ſword and drew it forth of the ſcabbard within 3. fingers breadth and as he ſtrained himſelfe to pull it quite forth, the fire iſſued from the blade ſo hot, that it burned part of his apparrel, ſo that he was conſtrained to leaue it there, being very ioyfull neuertheleſſe, that he had performed more then any of the reſt. Truly ſaid <hi>Macandon</hi> you are a loyall knight, and you haue almoſt had occaſion to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and I ſatisfied. Laſtly <hi>Palomir</hi> &amp; <hi>Dragonis</hi> approched, who were but the day before arriued at the court, and they gained no more then did <hi>Galaor:</hi> which cauſed <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candon</hi> to laugh, ſaying vnto them. My aduiſe is, that you ſhould put both of your parts in the ſword to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, &amp; it may be that you ſhall haue ſufficient to defend you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. You ſay true anſwered <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonis:</hi> but if you be this day made knight, you ſhall not be of ſo yong yeeres but that you may very well remember it hereafter. At that word euery one began to laugh, in the meane ſeaſon there was neuer a knight remaining in the Court who did not put himſelfe forward to gaine the ſword, and yet it was all in vaine. Wherefore the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> holding <hi>Oriana</hi> by the hand, came to take it vp: when <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candon</hi> ſaid vnto him: knight this ſword wil fit you better (if you may gain it) then that which you haue, &amp; yet it cannot be gotten by force of Armes without conſtancy in loue. It muſt then be mine anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> who there-withall did draw it forth of the ſcabbard as eaſily as if it had beene his owne, and that part of it, which ſeemed to be burning, became like vnto the other, and was as bright as euer was ſeene.</p>
                  <p>There withall <hi>Macandon</hi> (excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ioyfull) caſt himſelfe at the ſeete of the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> ſaying, vnto him, O noble knight, God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thy honour: for in ending my long trauaile you haue greatly honoured this Court. And truly that Lady who is ſerued of you, hath cauſe to loue you well, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſhe be the moſt miſchieuous &amp; diſſoyalſt woman in the world. Now therefore do me this fauour (if it pleaſe you) as to giue me the order of knighthood, for by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then you, may I obtaine it, nor yet enioy the fignory which of right belongeth vnto me ouer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great perſonages. Cauſe firſt a triall of the Kerebiefe to be made, anſwered the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward I will performe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I ought to do vnto you. Then grided he the ſword vnto his ſide, leauing his owne for him that would take it vp, and returned to the place from whence hee depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Great was the praiſe that all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gaue vnto him: but more great was the emulation of <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> towards him, concluding in their minds that ſo ſoone as the battell againſt king <hi>Cildadan</hi> was finiſhed (if they thence eſcaped with life) they would preſently ſeeke him out, and chalenge him to the combat, wherin they would die, or elſe make it knowne, vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that their brother <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> was a far better knight then he, who (as they thought) did eclipſe his honor, by the reputation whch he had gotten in gaining the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſword. At that inſtant the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies approched to proue which of them might obtaine the Kerchiefe, and firſt of all the Queene began, putting it vpon her head: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the floures did not any whit change their colour for her: Whereupon <hi>Macandon</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:7179:187"/>
ſaid, Madam if the king your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band haue ſhewed the little loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that remaineth in him, in his triall of the ſword, me thinks you do now well enough requite him for it. The Queene bluſhed and being halfe aſhamed ſhe returned to her place: then came the faire Queen <hi>Briolania,</hi> who therein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as much as the firſt. Vnto whom <hi>Macandon</hi> likewiſe ſaid: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me Madam, confidering the great beauty wherewith you are indued, you are more beloued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> louing, as wee may plainely ſee by this kerchief. After her came foure kings daughters, meruailous faire <hi>Elndia, Eſtreletta, Aldena,</hi> and the ſage <hi>Olinda,</hi> vpon whoſe heads the kerchiefe being placed, the withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red floures began a little to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, ſo that there was not any one of them which did not imagine that ſhe ſhould be the owner there-of, wherwith <hi>Oriana</hi> was in a great perplexity. Yet in the end the floures retutned to their withered colour. And for the ſame cauſe the Gentlewomen ſet them downe againe in their places: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it was not without receiuing ſome little frumpe from the olde Gentleman, who for one of his age could very fitly apply them. In the end <hi>Oriana</hi> perceiuing that euery one had failed, ſhee was very glad thereof, and therefore ſhe made a ſigne vnto the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> that he ſhould leade her to the Table, where the triall was to bee made, but ſo ſoone as the kerchiefe was ſet vpon her head the blaſted floures were as greene and as faire as thoſe that were moſt freſh, ſo that there was no difference at all to be perceiued. Wherefore <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candon</hi> cried out: Ah Madam, you are ſhee whom I haue ſought for fortie yeeres before you were borne, now ſaid he to the <hi>faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne,</hi> I pray you ſir deferre not the honour which is by you two due vnto me: but if you pleaſe (as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready I haue intreated you) make me knight, then of this faire Lady (according as I am bound) I will receiue my Armes. Let it be then preſently ſaid the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> for I am not to tarry long here. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Macandon</hi> cauſed forthwith his Armour to be brought, where-with he was preſently armd puting it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his white coate according as new knights are wont to doe, then the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> laying his ſword vpon his ſhoulder, and faſtning on his right ſpurre, gaue him his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Oriana</hi> girded on his Sword which was in like ſort brought by his Eſquires. Which ceremony being finiſhed, the Gentlewomen beholding him in that order, would in ſome ſort bee reuenged for the flouts which he had giuen them, and therefore they all burſt into a laughter, eſpecially <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Behold the countenance of this faire Lad how like a young knight hee looketh: Surely wee ought all to reioyce, becauſe hee ſhal all his life long ſeeme as freſh and luſty as now he is. How know you that, anſwered <hi>Eſtreletta?</hi> By his apparrell ſaid ſhe, which ſhall euen laſt as long as hee. Faire Gentlewomen ſaid <hi>Macandon,</hi> I would not change my pleaſure for the beſt of your fauours: and if I am not ſo youthfull as you ſay, yet am I not therefore to bee tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med leſſe diſcreete, but as for you who are yet yong and fooliſh, it were good that you learne to bee more aduiſed and modeſt then you are. This anſwere of his pleaſed the King very well, who in

he ſort liked of the gentlewomens ſpeeches. Whilſt theſe thinges were in doing, the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> was ready to depart, when the Queene who knew not her owne daughter, ſaid vnto her, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman although you are not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be knowne in this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet bethinke you what it will pleaſe you to command either of the king or me.

                     <hi>Oriana</hi> ſmiled at the words of <hi>Briolania,</hi> when the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> tooke his leaue, who ſeeing that the King would leade her towards her horſe he ſaid vnto him. Your Maieſty hath reaſon to honour her, by whom your Court hath this day beene more highly exalted, then euer heretofore by any other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it hath beene. In good ſooth anſwered the king, you ſay true, and therefore I will my ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct her forth of the Citty, in the which I could willingly deſire that it would pleaſe her, (and you alſo) to make ſome longer abode. Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, they all mounted on horſe-back, and the king held the raines of his daughters horſe, ſpeaking all the way vnto her, who anſwered him not one word againe, fearing to bee knowne. <hi>Galaor</hi> in like ſort entertained the <hi>faire Forlorne.</hi> But he ſo much hated him for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before rehearſed, that hee could not ſpeake one courteous word vnto him, whereat the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> laughed ſeeing his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers countenance, and thus they rode together a good way from the citty, vntill the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> ſaid vnto the King: I beſeech your Maieſty (if it pleaſe you) to paſſe no further, otherwiſe you may chance to diſpleaſe this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, beleeue me ſaid the King, I will rather returne.

Thus they departed, the king ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his way back to the citty, and the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> with <hi>Oriana</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Forreſt, being very ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that they had ſo well finiſhed that dangerous aduenture.

So <hi>Enil</hi> departed leauing <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Oriana</hi> together, who ſhortly after arriued at <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> where they found <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Durin</hi> ſtaying without the garden walls, to take their horſes when they ſhould come: they came to helpe the Princeſſe down, and they told her that <hi>Mabila</hi> and the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> were on the other ſide of the wall in the Orchard. Here-upon they rayſed vp a Lather, and <hi>Oriana</hi> mounted vpon it, whom the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> led by the hand, when they were at the top of the wall they beheld <hi>Mibila</hi> and the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> lying faſt aſleepe vpon the graſſe, very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy with the feare that they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured all the day, leaſt matters ſhould not ſort to ſo good effect as they wiſhed. Then <hi>Oriana</hi> called them ſhewing vnto them the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which ſhe had gotten, which ſo ſoone as they beheld they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ran to helpe her downe: and when ſhee was come into the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, <hi>Mabila</hi> ſaid vnto her, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, I neuer had greater dſire to ſee you returne, then I haue had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince your departure from hence. For if you had beene diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, the Damoſell &amp; I had been but in a bad taking: neuertheleſſe we determined to arme vs withpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. My good Coſin anſwered ſhe, thankes be to God, all goeth well, I haue the kerchiefe, and your Coſin hath the ſword. I, but thanke our Teares (ſaid <hi>Mabila)</hi> by the which they were chiefely gotten. My Coſin ſaid the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> I will not ſtick to ſhedde for you as much blood, as you haue for mee done teares, whenſoeuer you haue neede of me, but I pray if you haue any thing to eate, bring it into my Ladies chamber, for we haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vs good ſtomacks. Herewithal he led <hi>Oriana</hi> by the hand into the caſtle. Now becauſe wee will not digreſſe ouer far from that which happened to king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> we will leaue <hi>Oriana</hi> and her company at <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> to tell you what happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto his Maieſty and <hi>Galaor,</hi> as they returned from the <hi>faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne,</hi> before they came back vnto the citty. For a yong Damoſell did meete them, who deliuered vnto each one of them a letter, ſent from <hi>Vrganda the Vnknowne,</hi> and with-out ſaying any other thing vnto them, ſhe turned her horſe toward that way from whence ſhee came. Wherefore the king opened his Letter which contayned this that enſueth. Vnto you <hi>Liſuart</hi> king of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> ſuch health &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe as beſeemeth your Royall Maieſty.

                  <p>And be your Maieſty aſſured that without doubt all this ſhal happen therfore prouide for al your affairs

with good aduiſe. After that the king had read this letter, although that he was a ſtout prince, valiant, and of a couragious heart, yet (knowing <hi>Vrganda</hi> worthie to bee beleeued in all her propheſies) he was afraid, doubting leaſt the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> in whom he moſt truſted, would reuolt vnto the ſide of the <hi>Ireland</hi> king, and knowing alſo what danger was likely to enſue, hee neuertheleſſe diſſembled the matter whatſoeuer he though ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And after hee had a long while muſed thereupon, he declared the whole circumſtance of it vnto <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor,</hi> ſaying vnto him. My faithfull friend, I doe wholly determine to impart this ſecret vnto you, and to none other, that I may vnderſtand what is your aduiſe therein. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me, if it like your Maieſty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, conſidering what <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi> hath written vnto me, I haue more neede of counſell my ſelfe, then to counſell another, and if it were poſſible to conclude a peace betwixt you and the king of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (prouided that your honour were not thereby to be impared) me thinks it ſhould be for the beſt, or at leaſt if that cannot be, it were good that you ſhould not bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the battaile. For I do ſee in this Letter two ſtrange accidents likely to fall out, the one is that the <hi>faire Forlorne,</hi> ſhal wound you ſo cruelly, that he ſhall ſhed your blood vpon the ground, and the other that by three blowes which he ſhall giue, thoſe on his ſide ſhal remaine conquerors, and by this aduertiſement it ſeemeth that hee ſhall be againſt you. Truely ſaid the king I am ſo throughly aſſured of your good will that I know you doe faithfully and louingly aduiſe me, ſo as if my truſt were not in God (who hitherto hath beſtowed innumerable fauours vpon me, as in chuſing mee king ouer his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) or if I did not ſtedfaſtly belieue that no liuing man is able to with-ſtand his diuine determination, I ſhould haue great reaſon to bee in doubt, but you know that the hearts &amp; diſcretion of kings ought to bee anſwerable vnto the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their eſtate and calling, endeauouring as well to preſerue their ſubiects in ſafety, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for their owne ſecurity. And therefore I determine to remit all into the hands of my God, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to endure whatſoeuer dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he ſhal lay vpon me, for in him only remaineth the diſpoſition of things to come, for which cauſe my good friend, I aſſure you, that I will bee preſent in this battaile, for becauſe I would be partaker of all the good, honor, or hurt that may happen vnto thoſe which ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany me. Greatly did <hi>Galaor</hi> like of the kings magnanimous deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations and anſwered him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me it is not for nothing that your Maieſty is eſtemed the moſt vertuous and valianteſt Prince of the world, and if all kings could as well repreſſe the counſell of thoſe who diſſwade them from their haughtie enterpriſes, none durſt be once ſo bold as to ſay any thing vnto them, but that which ſhould bee for their honour and glory, but now your Maieſty may bee pleaſed to ſee what <hi>Vrganda</hi> hath written vnto me. Herewithall he began to reade his Letter, wherein was contained this which enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>Vnto you <hi>Don Galaor</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> moſt valiant and hardie Knight, I <hi>Vrganda the Vnknowne,</hi> doe ſend all hearty ſalutations, as ſhe who both loueth and eſteemeth you, &amp; I will that you ſhould vnderſtand
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7179:190"/>
that which muſt happen vnto you, in this cruell battell betweene the two kings, <hi>Liſuart</hi> and <hi>Cildadan.</hi> If you be there be you ſure that in the end thereof, your large and ſtrong members, ſhall want power to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt your inuincible heart, &amp; at the departure from the Combat your head ſhall bee in his power, who with the three blowes that he ſhall ſtrike ſhall remaine conqueror. In faith ſaid the king, if the contents of the Letter be true, and that you bee in this conflict, you ſee your death prepared, which ſhould bee a great loſſe conſidering your va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant beginning in deeds of armes, therefore I ſhall ſo order the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as at this time you ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from thence. It may pleaſe your Maieſty, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> I now do very wel perceiue, that the counſell which euen now I deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto you, hath diſpleaſed your Maieſty, when ſeeing mee ſound and able of body, you would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me to a matter ſo greatly to my diſhonour, God forbid that I ſhould herein obey you. Gentle friend ſaid the king, you ſpeake both vertuouſly, and valiantly, for the which I thanke you: and for this time, let vs leaue off this talke, and my aduice is, that none do ſee our Letters, for (it may bee) they may cauſe ſome feare &amp; aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment euen in the hearts of thoſe that doe thinke themſelues to bee moſt hardy and valiant. By this time they were come ſo neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Citty, that they entred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the gate thereof, &amp; as the king looked behinde, he beheld two knights armed at all points, whoſe horſes were ouer-trauelled &amp; wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and their armour all to broken, in ſuch ſort that it was very eaſy to be perceiued that they had been at ſome bickering. One was <hi>Brunco de Bon'Mer,</hi> and the other <hi>Branfil</hi> his brother, who came of purpoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> to be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe hundred knights which ſhould bee in the battaile, if it pleaſed him to accept of them. But by the way <hi>Brunco</hi> had beene aduertiſed, how the aduenture of the Sword was atchieued, where-with he was meruailous diſpleaſed that he came no ſooner, becauſe hee would haue tried his fortune therein, as he had done vnder the Arch of loyall louers, the which he had paſſed, and for the firm and conſtant loue that he did beare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Melicia</hi> ſiſter vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> hee did verily beleeue that no ſuch like aduenture might eſcape him: theſe two knights being come neer, did their dutie vnto the king, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the very courteouſly. Then ſaid <hi>Brunco,</hi> it may pleaſe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty we haue beene aduertiſed of a battell which you haue agreed to be executed by a few knights, &amp; ſo much the rather ought they to be ſelected and choſen men. For this cauſe if it would pleaſe your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to doe vs this honor that we might be of the ſame number your Maieſty may bee aſſured that wee would bee very deſirous to ſerue you. The King who had many times beene aduertiſed of the proweſſe of theſe twaine, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the valour of <hi>Don Brunco</hi> (who for a yong knight, was as much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed as any other that might be found) accepted of them very willingly, and thanked them for their good will.</p>
                  <p>Now did not <hi>Brunco</hi> as yet know <hi>Galaor,</hi> but at the ſame inſtant they entred into ſuch acquaintance and familiarity together, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Battell was finiſhed, they parted not aſunder.</p>
                  <p>And as the king entred into his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7179:190"/>
lodging, <hi>Enil</hi> came before him, with the head of <hi>Lindoraq</hi> which did hang by the hayre at the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trill of his horſe, and he had in his hand the ſhield and fingers of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus</hi> the Enchanter, by meanes whereof before he was come neer the Palace, a great number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did follow him, to know what newes he did bring. Afterwards being come into the kinges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, hee declared vnto him the meſſage that the <hi>faire Forlorne</hi> had ſent by him, wherewith he was no leſſe glad, then amaſed at ſo many good and bleſſed chanſes that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day happened and proceeded from this ſtrange knight, and hee remained a great while praiſing &amp; extolling him without ceaſing. In like ſort <hi>Filipinel</hi> who had been to giue defiance vnto the Giants, at the ſame inſtant approched, &amp; he recited the names and ſirnames of thoſe which were appointed to be in the battell of king <hi>Cildadan,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom there were found many ſtrong Giants, and other knights of great worth, who were all embarked already, and how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that foure dayes were paſt, they would all take landing in the bay of <hi>Vega,</hi> where the battell was to be foughten, then hee told the king how he had found at the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Lake (which ſtands in the Iſle of <hi>Mongaſa)</hi> king <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>North wales,</hi> and <hi>Angriotta d'Eſtrauaux</hi> priſoners vnto <hi>Grumadaca</hi> wiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Famongomad:</hi> who cauſed them to ſuffer infinit miſeries and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, whipping them euery day moſt cruelly ſo that their bodies were wounded all ouer, and they wrote a letter vnto the king, which <hi>Filipinel</hi> deliuered vnto him, the tenure whereof enſueth. Vnto the moſt high and mighty Prince <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> king of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and to all our Friends and Allies within his Dominions. We <hi>Arban</hi> once king of <hi>North wales,</hi> and <hi>Angriotta d'Eſtrauaux,</hi> now detained in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous priſon, doe let you know that our misfortune, more cruell then death it ſelfe, hath brought vs into the power of the moſt pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Grumadaca</hi> wife to <hi>Famongo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mad,</hi> who in reuenge of the death of her Husband and Sonne, doth daily cauſe vs to bee tortured with ſo many and ſtrange torments, that it is impoſſible to bee imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo as euery houre wee deſire the abridging of our daies, that thereby we might bee releaſed of our dolors. But this miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the more to lengthen our paine, deferreth our death as much as ſhe may, the which with our owne hands we had effected, but that the feare of the loſſe of our ſoules withheld vs.</p>
                  <p>And for as much as we are at this preſent ſo extreamely wounded, that wee are no longer able to reſiſt our deaths, we ſend you this Letter, written with our blood, by the which wee beſeech God both to grant you the victory againſt theſe traitors, that haue in ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane ſort tormented vs, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that he will bee pleaſed to haue mercy vpon our ſoules. Great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and compaſſion had the King for the loſſe of theſe 2. knights, ne-uertheleſſe ſeeing that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hee could in no ſort remedie their misfortun, he diſſembled his griefe, ſhewing as good a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as hee could, &amp; becauſe he would in no ſort diſcourage the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentlemen there preſent, he ſet before their eyes the accidents whereinto many others had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, for the maintenance of their Honour of Knighthood, from the which many times they haue with

Then he mounted vpon his horſe, and tooke with him his two Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, and rode vntill hee came where king <hi>Liſuart</hi> was encamped, within halfe a lengue of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, vnto whom he declared the meſſage of the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> at the which all the company did greatly reioyce. And the King anſwered: ſeeing that we haue the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> on our ſide, I doe alſo hope that wee ſhall haue the honor of the our enterpriſe. And now ſee the number of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred knights very well furniſhed, had wee but one knight more. It may pleaſe your Maieſty ſaid <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan,</hi> you now haue the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> is well worth fiue. This ſpeech did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all pleaſe <hi>Galaor, Floreſtan,</hi> not <hi>Agraies,</hi> for they hated the <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> vnto death, for the wrong which they thought he did vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> neuertheleſſe they held their peace, and <hi>Abradan</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued his anſwere of the King, returned to his gueſt, vnto whom he recited the pleaſure that euery one receiued at the newes that he brought from him, and of the hundred knights there was no more then one miſſing, but that they were all aſſembled. The which beeing vnderſtood by <hi>Enil,</hi> hee did ſo much that he found his Maſter apart and falling downe vpon his knees, he ſayd vnto him: My Lord, although my ſeruice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you hath not beene ſuch as it ſhould, and therefore haue I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all deſerued, yet am I ſo bolde at this time to requeſt one gift of you, which I beſeech you moſt humbly to graunt vnto mee. Demand it ſayd hee, and riſe vp. My Lord ſayd <hi>Enil,</hi> I pray you the make mee knight, to the end that I may goe vnto the King to entreat his Maieſty that hee will bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to accept of mee for the laſt knight of his number. Friend <hi>Enil</hi> ſayd the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> me thinkes that thou ſhouldſt beginne to try thy proweſſe in a place leſſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then this battaile will bee, not becauſe I would deferre to make thee knight, but in that I know it is too waighty a charge for thee. My Lord ſayde <hi>Enil,</hi> I knowe that in all my life I cannot haue a better meanes to gaine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: for if I die amongſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men of worth, my reputation ſhall bee there by encreaſed, and if I may eſcape, my renowne ſhall be perpetuall, hauing been one in number with a hundred of the beſt knights in the world. The <hi>Faire Forlorne</hi> hearing <hi>Enil</hi> ſpeake ſo vertuouſly, with a kind pittie that he had of him, he ruminated theſe words to himſelfe. Thou doſt well ſhew thy ſelfe to bee a kinſman vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the good knight <hi>Gandales</hi> my ſecond father. Then hee anſwered <hi>Enil,</hi> if thou haue ſo great a deſire to proue thy ſelf ſnch a one as thou ſayeſt, I will no longer diſſwade thee. And therewithall he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went vnto his hoſt, and entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

him to giue him an armour for his Eſquire, who deſired to bee made a knight, the which he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wherefore <hi>Enil</hi> according to the cuſtome, watched all night in the Chappell, and the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about the breake of day, after ſeruice was ended, hee receiued the order of knighthood by the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> which done they all mounted on horſe-back, in the companie of <hi>Abradan</hi> and his two Nephewes, who ſerued them for their Eſquires. In the end they arriued where king <hi>Liſuart</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ordered his battaile, being ready to goe meete his enemies, who ſtayed his comming in a plaine field, but when the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> hee was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ioyfull, and there was not any in the company, whoſe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage was not increaſed at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Then hee approached neer vnto the king, vnto whom he ſayd, it may pleaſe your Maieſty, I am come to accompliſh my promiſe, and alſo I do bring another knight with me, for I was aduertiſed that your number was not full, where-withall the king gaue him moſt hearty thanks, and although there was not any one of the hundred knights, who were not all approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and eſteemed amongſt the beſt, yet king <hi>Liſuart</hi> (after he had ordered his battallion, ſeeing his enemies aproached) beganne to make this Oration vnto his armie.

Thus did king <hi>Liſuart</hi> incourage his knights: and king <hi>Cildadan</hi> on the other ſide did the like vnto his, for he went from ranke to ranke to animate them, ſaying vnto them: Gentle knights of <hi>Ireland,</hi> if you vnderſtand vpon what occaſion you goe to fight, there is not one of you that will not blame his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, for being ſo ſlacke in the vndertaking of ſo glorious an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.

Ah if wee are conquerours they ſhall reſtore that which they haue had of vs. I am very ſure that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune doth fauour vs, for you ſee what men of worth are come vnto our ayde, knowing our great right. Let vs reſiſt them, let vs reſiſt them valiant knights.

One thing I would aduiſe you, that euery one helpe his fellow, keeping you as cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as poſſibly you may. And longer would hee haue continued his Oration, if hee had not ſeene King <hi>Liſuart</hi> prepared to ioyne with him.

Thus was <hi>Galaor</hi> lying ſicke on the other ſide, as hath beene recited, who heard the little doore of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7179:196"/>
garden open: which cauſed him to riſe from his bed, as well as hee could, and hee perceiued a faire Gentlewoman comming vnto him, being very richly attired, the which did bring with her a knight ſo olde and crooked, that it was wonder how hee could bee able to ſtand. Theſe approching nere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſayd to him through the grates of yron, without opening the chamber dore. Knight, prouide for your ſoules health, for we will not henceforth warrant you. Then the Damoſell tooke forth two lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boxes, one of iron, and the other of ſiluer: and ſhewing them vnto <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſhe ſayd vnto him. Knight, the party which hath cauſed you to come hither, will not that you ſhould die, before ſhe doe knowe whether you will accompliſh her will or no, and in the meane ſeaſon ſhe will cauſe your wounds to bee cured. Gentlewoman, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> if ſhee deſire that I ſhould do any thing contrary to mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I had rather die. You may doe, ſayd ſhe, as you liſt, although it is your choyce either to liue or die. Herewithall the olde man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the gate, and ſo ſoonas they were entred into the chamber, the the Gentlewoman preſently gaue vnto him the yron boxe, willing him to ſtep back, the which he did. Afterwards ſhe ſayde vnto <hi>Galaor.</hi> My Lord, I am ſo ſorry for your ſickneſſe, that for to ſaue your life, I will hazard mine owne death, and I will declare that which I was put in charge to doe. Which is, that I ſhould fill theſe two boxes, the one with poyſon, and the other with oyntment to make you ſleepe, to the end that when you did awake, you might feele ſuch extreame paine, that with the rage thereof you might cruely end your life, but I haue done cleane contrary, for I haue filled them with ſuch a ſalue, that if you vſe it bur ſeuen dayes together, you ſhall finde your ſelfe whole, ſound; and able to mount on horſe-backe. Then ſhe rubbed his wounds with the oyntment, the which was of ſuch vertue, that at the ſame inſtant his paine was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, and hoe felt ſuch caſe, that he ſayde vnto the Damoſell. Faire Gentlewoman, you doe binde me ſo greatly vnto you, that if euer I come forth from hence, you may bee ſure that neuer any Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was better recompenced by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knight, then you ſhall be by me, neuertheleſſe, if you haue noth the meanes to deliuer mee, I beſeech you at the leaſt, doe ſo much that <hi>Vrganda the vnknowne</hi> may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed thereof, for I haue euer-more had a great confidence in her. The Gentlewoman began to laugh, and anſwered him. What? doe you make ſuch account of <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda,</hi> ſeeing that hitherto ſhe hath been ſo careleſſe of your wealth or woe? I know well, ſayd he, that as ſhe knoweth the ſecret thoughts of men, ſo is ſhee not ignorant how much my deſire is to ſerue her. Ne-uer care you for any other <hi>Vrganda</hi> (anſwered ſhe) then me, and haue only a good hope, endeuouring to haſten your health, taking vnto you the courage of a valiant man, ſuch as you haue alwaies bin eſteemed, ſeeing that you know that man-hood and valour, is not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit at combats and dangerous encounters, but in other accidents that may ſuddainly happen, like as at this preſent the cafe ſtandeth. And for the recompence of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill that I doe vndertake, to heale you and deliuer you from hence, I pray you grant vnto me one gift, which ſhall neither be hurtfull nor

diſhonurable vnto you. Truſt me Damoſell ſayd hee, you ſhall haue of mee euen whatſoeuer you ſhall pleaſe, if it may well and lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be performed. Goe to, then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhee, let this ſuffice you now, vntill it bee time for mee to returne againe to dreſſe you, in the meane ſeaſon couer you, and feigne as if you ſlept ſoundly, the which hee did. Then the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman called the olde man, and ſayd vnto him, ſee how the knight ſleepeth, the poyſon doth now worke vpon him. All the better, anſwered the olde man, hee which hath brought him hither, ſo farre as I ſee ſhall be ſufficiently reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon him, and ſeeing that you haue ſo well obeyed that which you were commanded, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent henceforth that you doe come without any guard at all to viſite him. But vſe him after this manner fifteene dayes together, for at that time they ſhall come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who (for the iniurie that hee hath done vnto them) ſhall take ſuch ſatisfaction of him, as they pleaſe. <hi>Galaor</hi> heard all their talke, and hee knewe very well that the old man was his mortall enemie, neuertheleſſe hee had ſome hope in the Damoſels promiſe, who had aſſured him that hee ſhould be healed in ſeauen dayes, hoping (if ſo ſhee did) that hee might eaſily ſaue himſelfe from their hands. Hereupon the olde man and the Damoſell departed: but ſhee tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried not long before hee did ſee her returne with two other young virgins, exceeding faire, who brought victuals vnto <hi>Galaor,</hi> and cauſed him to eate.

Farre otherwiſe did it happen vnto king <hi>Cildadan,</hi> who beeing ſhut vp within a Tower, and layd vpon his bed, did ſee a doore of ſtone to open (the which was cloſe faſtened in the wall, that it ſeemed as if it had beene the wall it ſelfe) by the which there entred in a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of middle age, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with two armed knights, the which came cloſe to his bed ſide.

                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:7179:199"/>
ſeeing you acknowledge your fault, you muſt be better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed hereafter. You haue had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience enough, by that which is paſt, what inconuenience may happen vpon ſo light occaſions, take heed henceforth then, how you commit the like errors. Thus were theſe two Ladies reconciled together as before, neuertheleſſe ſhortly after <hi>Mabila</hi> came vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> vnto whom ſhe declared all the talke that <hi>Oriana</hi> had with her, reproouing him ſharpely for that which he had ſaid to <hi>Briolania</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, knowing that already ſhe had been ſuſpitious of them both. Therefore my good Coſen ſayde <hi>Mabila,</hi> endeauour henceforth not to giue her any farther occaſion to vſe you ill, ſpeaking hereafter more diſcreetely then you haue done, eſpecially before my Lady, for it is a very hard matter wholly to baniſh and extinguiſh iealouſie from a woman after it is much rooted in her mind, and had it not beene for my ſharpe anſwer vnto her, by my faith ſhee had paſſed the bounds of reaſon. Sweet Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I doe much maruaile at the phantaſie of my Lady, but yet I doe giue you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great thankes, for the counſell that you giue vnto mee, although I doe ſweare vnto you that whatſoeuer I did ſpeake, I thought was wholy for her aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And I will tell you how eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one knoweth that <hi>Briolania</hi> is reputed one of the faired Ladies in the world, ſo as one would thinke her ſufficient to enter into the forbidden chamber, but this thought is falſe: for I haue ſeene the Image of <hi>Grimaneſa,</hi> vnto whoſe beauty <hi>Briolania</hi> in no ſorte comes neere, wherefore it is moſt ſure that ſhee ſhall neuer attaine to this honour, the which my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſhall obtaine without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie. Neuertheleſſe if it were firſt before <hi>Briolania</hi> had made her try all therein, one might ſay after-ward, If ſhe had begun before <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> that then ſhee had firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued the aduenture: by means whereof I was ſo bold (in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of my Lady) to giue her that counſell which you haue heard, <hi>Mabila</hi> liked well this excuſe of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and tolde <hi>Oriana</hi> thereof, who did greatly repent her that ſhee had ſpoken ſo much, fearing leaſt <hi>Amadis</hi> would haue been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with her, and to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend: for this fault which ſhe had committed, ſhe ſent him word by <hi>Mabila,</hi> that he ſhould come to ſee her in her lodging, where ſhe and <hi>Briolania</hi> ſtayd for him, the which he did. At his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming the Ladies tooke him by the hand, and made him fit betweene them, then they prayed him to tell them the truth of that which they would demand of him, wherunto he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ended. Tell vs then ſayd <hi>Oriana,</hi> what is the Ladie that gained the kerchief with the flowers, when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the burning ſword? <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> perceiued well that he was not onely ouertaken, but alſo conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to tell the truth, for which cauſe he anſwered <hi>Oriana:</hi> In faith Madame I know no more what ſhe was then you doe, although I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in her company ſixe daies together. But thus much did I ſee in her, that ſhe had the faireſt haire that any Lady or Damoſell could poſſibly haue, and ſhee is beſides moſt beautifull, and of a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent grace, for the reſt you know as much as I doe. By my faith ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> if ſhee got the kerchiefe with great honour, it had bin like afterward to haue coſt her
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7179:200"/>
very deere as it was tolde mee, for without your aſſiſtance <hi>Arcalaus</hi> the enchanter and his Nephew <hi>Lindoraq</hi> had taken it from her, &amp; alſo done her ſome villany. It was not hee anſwered <hi>Briolania</hi> (if hee be <hi>Amadis)</hi> but another who was called the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> from whom wee muſt not derogate the honour to attribute it vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And although I am greatly bound vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> yet will I not let to ſpeake the truth of the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> becauſe if the one haue ſurmounted <hi>Apoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in proweſſe by winning of the Firme-Iſland, the ſame being vnto him an exceeding great reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo in like ſorte was the other worthy of no leſſe praiſe, who in one onely day ouerthrew tenne of the beſt knights in Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> and ſlew the moſt redoubted Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Famongomad,</hi> and <hi>Baſigant</hi> his ſonne: if <hi>Amadis</hi> did paſſe vnder the Arch of loyall louers, in whoſe fauour the Images of copper did ſound a more melodious tune, then it did for any other that euer proued the ſame aduenture, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by manifeſting his loyalty, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in like ſort that the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne</hi> had as great an aduantage in gaining the the burning ſword, the which for the ſpace of threeſcore years no other could draw forth of his ſcabbard. Therfore Madame, it is not reaſon to take away the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> and without deſert to giue it vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> ſeeing that both in prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe and loyalty they may (as I thinke) equall one another. And as they were in theſe pleaſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, a Damoſell came and told <hi>Amadis</hi> that the King asked for him, becauſe that <hi>Don Quedragant</hi> and <hi>Landin</hi> his Nephew were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to acquite them of the promiſe that they had made by the meanes whereof <hi>Amadis</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to leaue the Lady, and to goe vnto the Court. By the way hee met with <hi>Bruneo</hi> and <hi>Branfil,</hi> who followed him, &amp; they found that <hi>Quedragant</hi> had begunne his ſpeech vnto the King, ſaying: It may pleaſe your Maieſty, I haue ſtayed heere for <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> according to the couenant that I made with the <hi>Faire Forlorne,</hi> and now that hee is in the Court I will diſcharge me of my promiſe. True it is that by force of armes, I was conſtrained to graunt vnto the <hi>Faire Forlorn</hi> that I ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from your company, vntill <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> were returned, and then hee being come before your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I ſhould ceaſe all quarrels that I had enterpriſed againſt him, for the death of king <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> my brother, and neuer after to demand any thing at his hands, therefore and in like ſort that I ſhould neuer hereafter beare arms againſt your Maieſty, or any of yours.

determined to aduance him, as the the force which hee did ſhew in this laſt battaile can ſufficiently witneſſe, the honour whereof ought wholly to bee yeelded vnto him and to no other. For this cauſe it may pleaſe your Maieſty, ſeeing my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> is heere preſent, that firſt you will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge mee of that which I haue promiſed vnto him vnder a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary name, and as for him I remit all the euill will that I did beare vnto him, for the death of my late deceaſed brother king <hi>Abies,</hi> and I doe further intreate him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept mee for his companion and perpetuall friend. Sir <hi>Quedragant</hi> anſwered the King, you ſpeake like a prudent and wiſe knight, for what proweſſe or courage ſoeuer a Gentleman hath, if hee bee not gouerned by counſell &amp; reaſon, he is not worthy that any man ſhould make account of him. You are ſufficiently knowne for one of the beſt knights in the world, yet you may be aſſured that the fellowſhip which you demand of <hi>Amadis</hi> ſhal in no ſort deminiſh your praiſe &amp; renowne, you two continuing in mutuall amity together: and you may beleeue that hee will bee very glad to accept of the offer which you doe make vnto him. Is it not true gentle friend? ſayd the King vnto <hi>Amadis.</hi> If it like your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty anſwered he, <hi>Quedragant</hi> is ſo worthy a knight that his fame is ſpread abroad in many places, and ſeeing that it pleaſeth him to chuſe mee for his conſort, I doe thankefully accept his kind offer. Herewithall they embraced, and ſo long did their friendſhippe thenceforth continue, that it was neuer ſeperated but by death. At the ſame time was <hi>Floreſtan</hi> &amp; <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> before the King, purchaſing their leaue to enter into the field, according to their appointed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement (a good while before) in maintenance of <hi>Amadis</hi> his quarrell againſt <hi>Quedragant:</hi> but when they ſaw them friends their combate was finiſhed, and their hatred conuerted into amity, wherewith <hi>Landin</hi> was exceeding glad, for hee had already proued <hi>Floreſtan</hi> in the iourney againſt king <hi>Cildadan,</hi> and ſeene his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and proweſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus were theſe quarrels ended, &amp; how much the Court had here-tofore been troubled, by ſo much was the ioy and paſtime thereof increaſed, neuertheleſſe the King hauing not forgotten the miſerie wherein king <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Northwales</hi> and <hi>Angriota de Eſtrauaux</hi> remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, (after he had ſome few dayes ſtayed with the Ladies) he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke their deliuerance, and the better to effect the ſame, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to paſſe into the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza,</hi> to ſet them at liberty, wherewith hee made his knights acquainted. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, your Maieſty doth know that my brother <hi>Galaor</hi> hath beene loſt in your ſeruice, therefore I beſeech you to excuſe mee from accompaning your grace in this voyage, for if God pleaſe my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins and I will goe ſeeke him as it is reaſon, and ſo ſoone as we haue found him, I aſſure your Maieſty that incontinently wee will follow vnto that place where wee ſhall heare your grace abideth.

both when you liſt, and with ſuch companie as you like.

                     <p>How the euening enſuing, the King being riſen from the table, walking about the galleries of his Pallace, he beheld two great fires vpon the Sea, that came directly towards the Cittie.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow it happened the ſame day after the King had ſupped, as hee walked along a gallerie, being almoſt bed-time, hee beheld two ſtrange fires vpon the Sea, which came with great ſwiftneſſe directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Cittie. Wherewith he was greatly amaſed, becauſe hee thought it very difficult that water and fire ſhould continue together, eſpecially when hee beheld in the midſt of theſe fires, a galley, at the maſt whereof were many great burning torches, ſo that one would haue iudged the veſſell had beene all on fire. This wonder did aſtoniſh the people ſo much that in a manner they came all forth of the Cittie, preſuming that ſeeing the Sea was not able to quench this fire, it was impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Cittie from being burnt to aſhes, if the ſame once tooke hold thereof, wherefore the King as fearfull as the reſt mounted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his horſe, and came forth with them vpon the ſands. And as hee came neere the water ſide, he did ſee that the moſt part of all the knights were already arriued, and amongſt the reſt was <hi>Amadis, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil,</hi> and <hi>Guillan,</hi> who were at that time ſo neere the galley, which was hard at ſhore, that he thought it impoſſible for them to eſcape from the fire thereof. Hereupon he ſet ſpurres to his horſe, becauſe hee tooke on exceedingly with the noyſe that was made, and whether hee would or no hee brought him cloſe to the galley ſide: vpon the which ſhortly after he ſaw a cloth lifted vp which couered it, and a Damoſell appeared clothed in white ſilke, that held a ſmall Coſer of gold in her hand, which ſhe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, then ſhee tooke out of it a burning taper which ſhe caſt into the Sea, and preſently the two great fires vaniſhed away ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, that it was not perceiued what was become of them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all the people were maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous glad, ſeeing that they were out of danger, for there remained no more light then that of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which burned vpon the maſt of the galley, with the brightneſſe whereof all the ſhoare receiued light. Then the galley was plainly perceiued which was decked with many garlands of floures, &amp; inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts began to ſound very ſweetly.

And ſhe marched forth firſt of all that had throwne the raper into the Sea, who comming a ſhoare did her duty vnto the King, and he receiued her very kindely, ſaying vnto her: Madame in ſatisfaction of the feare wherewith your fire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted vs, tell vs if y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

you ſhall without doubt come to paſſe. By my faith anſwered <hi>Oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> I could haue beene well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to haue forborne this curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the ſorrowfull end that is prepared for mee doth trouble all my ſpirits. Faire Lady, ſaide <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda,</hi> another time bee leſſe curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to vnderſtand that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond your capaſitie: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, oftenrimes ſuch things as are miſticall and fearefull, doe for the moſt part turne into ioy, pleaſure, and profit, therefore be not you diſcomforted in any ſort, ſeeing that you are daughter vnto the beſt king, &amp; moſt vertuous Queene that liueth vpon the earth, beeing endued with ſuch excellent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that your renowne is ſpreade ouer all countreies, and more-ouer you are beloued of him, who is honoured and eſteemed more then any other Knight. You know as well as I that hee loueth you, by the experience not onely of that which hath beene tolde you, and you haue made knowne vnto him, but alſo by the aduentures which hee hath brought to paſſe in your preſence: therefore you ought to thinke your ſelfe happy aboue all thoſe that are beſt beloued, being miſtreſſe of him, that deſerueth (by his chiualrie) to be Lord of all the world. Now it is time to wake the Ladies, &amp; end our diſcourſe. Here-withall ſhee began to read againe in her booke, and at that inſtant the Ladies that were aſleepe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to breath as if they had beene ouerwearied, and ſhortly after they roſe vp, but when the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> perceiued, that ſhee was laied in ſuch ſort naked in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the chamber, there was ne-uer woman more amaſed then ſhe, the which when <hi>Oriana</hi> perceiued, ſhee demanded (ſmiling to her ſelfe) if ſhee were come thither to ſeeke freſh aire. By my faith Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, anſwered ſhe, I know neither who brought me hither, nor can I remember how I came hither. Whereat they all began to laugh: and after they were ready they went vnto the Kings lodging, whome they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d together with the Queen in the church: and ſo ſoone as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice was ended, the King came va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Vrganda,</hi> and bid her good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſhee after her duty done vnto his Maieſtie, ſaide, that if it were his pleaſure to cauſe the Knights and Ladies in his Court to aſſemble together, that before her departure (which ſhould bee very ſhortly) ſhee would declare ſomething before them that ſhold happen vnto him, heereupon the King appointed a large hall to bee made ready, in the which the next morning a great number of Lords and Ladies were come. Then <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi> beeing in the midſt of them all, addreſſing her ſpeech vnto the King, ſhee ſaide vnto him. Seeing that your Maieſtie hath kept the letters which I did write vnto you and <hi>Galaor,</hi> preſently after the <hi>Fair Forlorne</hi> had obtained the burning ſword, and the Damoſell she ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife with flowres, it may pleaſe you now to cauſe them to be read, that euery one may plainely know that I am not ignorant of things before they happen. Heereupon hee ſent for them, and they were read before al the aſſiſtance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it plainely appeared that ſhee had wholly foretold the manner of the battaile, euen as it happened out, and they all greatly wondred thereat, eſpecially at the ſtout heart of the King, that would be in a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile ſo dangerous, when hee was before hand threantned ſo rigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his letter. In like ſort was it
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7179:204"/>
certainly known that the <hi>Faire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne</hi> had been the cauſe of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, by the three blowes that hee gaue. The firſt when he caſt King <hi>Cildadan</hi> at <hi>Galaors</hi> feet, the ſecond in killing <hi>Sarmadan</hi> the Leonnois, and the third when hee ſuccoured the king, whom the ſtout <hi>Mandafa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bul</hi> of the virmillion tower did car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto his ſhips, whoſe arme hee cut off cloſe by the elbow, which was the cauſe of his preſent death. And in like ſort that which ſhe had ſaid of <hi>Galaor</hi> was come to paſſe, for his head was certainly at the mercy of the <hi>Faire Forlorue,</hi> at that time when the Damoſels deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to carry him away. But now, ſaid <hi>Vrganda,</hi> I will tell you in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that which muſt happen, great contention ſhall ariſe between the mighty ſerpent &amp; the ſtrong Lion, which ſhall be aided by many cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell beaſts, they ſhall come with ſuch fury, that a great numder of them ſhall ſuffer moſt cruel death. The ſubtill Roman foxe ſhall bee wounded with the clawes of the ſtrong Lyon, and his skin ſhall be cruelly torne, wherewith the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſerpent ſhall bee brought into wonderfull perplexitie. In this time the me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ke ſheepe couered with blacke wooll, ſhall come into the midſt of them, who by his great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie and pittifull bleatings, ſhal pacifie the pride and fierceneſſe of their courages, cauſing them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part one from the other, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the ſtarued wolues ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from the ſteepe mountaines againſt the mighty ſerpent, who being by them put to fight with a great part of his traine, ſhall bee cloſed vp in one of his dens. The tender licorne putting his mouth to the eare of the fierce Lion, ſhall awake him out of his ſound ſleepe with his loud crye, making him afterwards to take part of his beaſts, with the which hee ſhall ſpeedily goe to the ſuccour of the mighty ſerpent, whom they ſhall finde ſo bitten and wounded by theſe ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued wolues, that his blood ſhall bee aboundantly ſhed vpon the earth, at the ſame time ſhall he be deliuered from the teeth of the wolues, and they be cut in pieces. Then the life of the mighty ſerpent being reſtored (leauing within his den all the poyſon of his entrails) he ſhall bee contented to put him-ſelfe betweene the clawes of the ſtrong Lyon, and the white hind, who in the dreadfull Forreſt did lift vp her greeues to Heauen, ſhall bee taken from thence and called home againe. Wherefore noble King, may it pleaſe your Maieſtie to cauſe this to bee written, which before all this company I haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, for there is no doubt but all this ſhall come to paſſe. I will ſo doe, anſwered hee, ſeeing it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you, but I beleeue there is not any of vs that at the preſent vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands this propheſie. Aſſure you, ſaide ſhee, that a time will come when it ſhall be manifeſted vnto all of you. So ſaying ſhe caſt her eies vpon <hi>Amadis,</hi> whom ſhe perceiued to be maruailous penſiue, and ſaid vnto him. My Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> you muſe vpon that which cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile you, wherefore expel this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from your minde, and harken vnto a match that you ſhall make, wherein you ſhall get little gaine. At ſuch time as you ſhal be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to death in the defence of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others life, the ſmart being yours, and the profit his, the recompence that you ſhall reape thereby, ſhall be a wonderfull diſcontent, and a baniſhnſent from that whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you ſhall moſt deſire to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Then ſhall your good
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7179:204"/>
rich and ſharpe Sword ſo bruiſe your bones, and in ſo many places wound your fleſh, that with the loſſe of your blood you ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very feeble, and moreouer you ſhall bee ſo ſharpely purſued, that if halfe the world were yours, you would giue it, that your ſword were caſt into the bottom of ſome deepe lake, from whence it could neuer be taken forth againe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bethinke you of your deſtiny, which ſhall be ſuch as I haue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told you. <hi>Amadis</hi> ſeeing that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one had their eyes fixed vpon him, looked vp with a Imiling countenance and anſwered <hi>Vrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> Madame, by the things that are already come to paſſe wherof you foretold vs, we may wel credit and beleeue that which now you tell vs, and knowing that I am mortal, I am very ſure that my life ſhall not be prolonged one minute longer then it pleaſeth God, and therfore whilſt I may, I will endeauour to gaine ſome reputation, rather then ſeeke to conſerue my life, Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding if any perill were to be doubted, I ſhould haue more occaſion to feare thoſe that doe hourely happen vnto mee, then ſuch as are hidden &amp; yet to come. I know well ſaid <hi>Vrganda</hi> that it is more eaſie to draw the Sea drie, then afright your vndaunted and magnanimious courage with any further dread of danger. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if it pleaſe your Maieſty (ſaid ſhee to the king) that I muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently take my leaue of you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I beſeech you what I haue aduertiſed you of, before this great and honourable company, as ſhee that deſireth the honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of your Maieſty, and ſtop your eares henceforth from thoſe, whoſe words you ſhall know to be vniuſt and peruerſe. Herewith all ſhe aroſe from her place and al the company in like fort, and ſhortly after ſhe tooke leaue of the King, and of the reſt of his court, which done ſhe returned into her galley, accompanied onely with the foure knights that had conducted her to the Court, who hauing ſeene her embarked, returned backe to the Citty, but they had no ſooner tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their backs, when a thicke and great Cloude ſo ouerſhaddowed the ſhip, that preſently they loſt the ſight thereof.</p>

Wherefore ſhee ſpake aloude and ſaid, It may pleaſe your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, <hi>Grumadaca</hi> the giant of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning lake, and the faire <hi>Madaſima,</hi> with the moſt redoubted <hi>Ardan Canila</hi> (who is at this preſent with them, to protect and defend them againſt you) haue knowne for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that you determine to paſſe into their country to aſſaile them, and becauſe the ſame cannot bee done without the loſſe of many worthy men on eyther ſide, they haue deuiſed a meanes (if your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty think good to auoid the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of blood, &amp; the loſſe of diuers valiant knights, which is this, that the combat of two perſons onely ſhall determine the quarrell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene you and them, vpon the victory of him that ſhall win the field, the one is the valiant and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Ardan Canila,</hi> the other <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> of <hi>Caule</hi> here preſent: vpon this condition, that if <hi>Amadis</hi> bee ouercome, <hi>Ardan</hi> may freely cut off his head and carry it with him, to the burning lake vnto <hi>Madaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and alſo if fortune proue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſaid <hi>Ardan,</hi> &amp; that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> remaine conqueror, the land &amp; the countrie that you intend to conquer, ſhal without contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be yeelded vp into your hands.

aſſured that <hi>Arden</hi> to deſpight him the more, will ſend their heads vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for a preſent, very ſhortly. Damoſell anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> if I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to this combat, what ſecurity ſhall the king haue for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this your promiſe? I will tell you ſaid ſhe, The faire <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima</hi> accompanied with twelue Gentlewomen of great birth, ſhall bee ſent as hoſtages and become the Queenes priſoners, vnder this condition, that if this which I haue ſaid be not wholly accompliſhed, the king may cauſe them all to die in what ſort hee pleaſeth, and as touching you, I demand no other aſſurance, then this, that if you be vanquiſhed <hi>Madaſima</hi> may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward haue your head without contradiction. And to let you know that they from whom I bring this meſſage, will not gaine-ſay that which I haue promiſed, I will yet further cauſe <hi>Andangel</hi> the old giant, with his two ſons, and nine of the chiefeſt knights of the countrie, to enter into the king his priſon, as pledges for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the former couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Truly anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> if the king and Queene haue theſe perſons which you ſpeake of in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the ſecurity is ſufficient, but yet you ſhall haue no anſwere of me, vnleſſe you firſt grant to dine with me in my lodging, with theſe two Eſquires that attend vpon you. I do greatly wonder ſaid ſhee, what moueth thee ſo inſtantly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate and inuite me to dine in thy company, ſeeing that I hate thee more then any man that I know. I am ſorry for that ſaid he, for I loue you, and will willingly doe you all the honour and ſeruice that I am able, but if you will haue an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, grant mee that which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of you.

But ſhee had no ſooner ſet her foote in the ſame, but ſhet caſt her eyes vpon <hi>Amadis</hi> his good Sword, which ſhee thought was of ſo ſtrange a faſhion, that from that time forth, ſhe determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſteale it, if ſhee might finde the meanes, and to doe the ſame more cleanly, ſhe walked ſo long about the chamber, that as <hi>Amadis</hi> and his people had their backs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, ſhe ſlily drew the ſword forth of the ſcabbard, and held it vp cloſe vnder her cloake. Afterwards ſhee preſently went forth of the chamber, and taking aſide one of the Eſquires (in whom ſhee moſt truſted) ſhe gaue it vnto him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: doeſt thou know what thou ſhalt do? run quickly into my ſhip, and hide me this Sword vnder the

Then <hi>Amadis</hi> entred into talke with the Damoſell, demanding of her at what houre <hi>Madaſims</hi> would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue in the Court. I beleeue anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe, that you may ſee her, and ſpeake with her before the king haue dined: but what moues you faire ſir to enquire ſo much after her?

But ſhee hearing him ſpeake ſo raſhly, held her peace: and although ſhe greately deſired to be reuenged of him for the death of her Father, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom <hi>Amadis</hi> had ſlaine, yet
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7179:207"/>
did ſhe ſo extreamely abhorre <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> that ſhee a great deale rather wiſhed his death then his life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee pretended to marry her. For ſhe was exceeding faire, and he a deformed villaine and voide of all humanity, and this combat was not practiſed by her meanes, but by the perſwaſion of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had ſent for him, for the defence of her Countrie vpon this condition, that if he reuenged the death of her husband and ſonne, ſhe would giue it vnto him, and her daughter <hi>Madaſima</hi> in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, for hee was ſo feared and had in ſuch reputation, that ſhee thought ſhe could not beſtow her daughter better. And to let you know his manners and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hee was deſcended from the race of giants, borne in a Prouince called <hi>Canila,</hi> the which was in a manner wholly inhabited by ſuch kinde of people, notwithſtanding hee was ſomewhat leſſe of body then they, but not in ſtrength: his ſhoulders were narrow, his necke and breſt vnreaſonable thicke, his hands and thighes large, his legs long and crooked, his eyes holow, flat noſed like an Ape, his noſtrels wide and lothſome, his lips great, his haire red and thicke briſtelled in that ſort, as very hardly might it be curled. To conclude, he was ſo beſet with freckles and blacke ſpots, that his face ſeemed as though it had been of ſundry ſorts of fleſh, hee was of the age of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeeres or thereabout, bold and expert in armes, furious, ſpitefull, and as vncourteous as might bee. And yet ſince hee was twenty and fiue yeeres of age, he neuer fought with any Giant or other knight, eyther a foote, a horſeback, or at wreſtling, that was able to reſiſt him, &amp; whom he did eaſily not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome ſuch was the beauty, faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and gentle behauiour of <hi>Arden Canila.</hi> When the iniurious Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell heard <hi>Ardan</hi> make ſuch large promiſes vnto <hi>Madaſima,</hi> &amp; perceiued that ſhee made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof, ſhe tooke vpon her to ſpeake in her behalfe, me thinks my Lord that you ſhould thinks the victory very ſure on your ſide, ſeeing that Fortune is ſo faauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto you, and ſo contrary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your enemy, as you may well perceiue, in that ſhee hath cauſed him to loſe the beſt part of his armes. And this ſhee ſaid in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſword which ſhe had ſtolne. By my Gods, ſaid <hi>Ardan,</hi> I am more glad of his diſpleaſure for the want thereof, then for any good that I hope to receiue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, for although <hi>Amadis</hi> had the force of three ſuch as hee is, yet were hee not able to withſtand the ſtrength of my arme, accuſtomed to came his betters. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning very early hee departed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Madaſima,</hi> and and the reſt which ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vp as hoſtages, according to the promiſe that the Damoſell had made vnto king <hi>Liſuart</hi> before the Combat was agreed vpon, and <hi>Canila</hi> did aſſuredly hope, that he ſhould eaſily obtaine the victory. By meanes whereof hee departed with great ioy, ſaying vnto thoſe that were with him, <hi>Amadis</hi> is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſed for one of the beſt knights in the world, neuertheleſſe I will haue his head, if he dare enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the liſts againſt me, and by that meanes my glory ſhal be the more increaſed in the ouercomming of him, my Lady ſhall reſt well reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and I remaine her husband and louer. And becauſe he would know before hee entred into the court, whether <hi>Amadis</hi> had repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7179:207"/>
him or not, hee ſent the iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Damoſell before, to aduertiſe the King of their comming, and in the meane ſeaſon hee cauſed his tents to be ſet vp, ſomewhat neere the Cittie where King <hi>Liſuart</hi> did remaine. But you muſt know, that incontinently after the Damoſell was departed from <hi>Amadis</hi> his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, <hi>Enil</hi> told him thereof: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe he would prouide all things neceſſary for his enterpriſe, hee withdrew him vnto his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, accompanied with ſome of his moſt priuat friends, and in like ſort there came at that inſtant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Floreſtan, Agrates, Galuanes</hi> without land, and <hi>Guillan</hi> the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, who were altogether ignorant of the enterpriſe of this new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. But when they were aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereof, thinking that it ſhould haue beene performed with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number of knights, ther was not any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who were not diſpleaſed with <hi>Amadis,</hi> in that he had not cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to aſſiſt him therein, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Guillan</hi> who greatly deſired to proue his man-hood againſt <hi>Arda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Canila,</hi> for hehad heard that he was eſteemed for one of the ſtrongeſt Knights in all the Weſt. And as he was about to reprou <hi>Amadis</hi> in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting him, <hi>Floreſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him, ſaying vnto his brother. So God helpe me, my Lord, I now doe very wel perceiue, the little loue and the ſmall account that you doe make of me, in that you would not ſend for me to be with you in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. In faith, anſwered <hi>Agraies,</hi> if hee had thought mee any thing worth, he would not haue left mee behinde, and what of me? ſaid <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanes.</hi> My Lords, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I beſeech you all to holde mee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and not to bee diſpleaſed with mee, aſſuring you that if it had beene in my choyſe to haue elected a companion to aſſiſt mee in this encounter (ſeeing the great proweſſe wherewith you are all endued) I could not tell which of you to chuſe. But <hi>Ardan</hi> deſired to fight with mee alone, for the hate hee beareth vnto mee, and the loue he hath to <hi>Madaſima,</hi> and ſeeing that hee hath ſo required it, I neither could, nor ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it, without ſhewing my ſelfe to be a recreant and a coward, nor I could not make any other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, then that which was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his demand. And when he ſhould haue compriſed any more Knights with him, where doe you thinke I would haue ſought for aid and ſuccour but with you, beeing my friends? ſeeing you know how my ſtrength is redoubled when we are together. In this ſortdid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> excuſe himſelfe, praying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all to beare him company the next day, to go meete <hi>Madaſima,</hi> both to receiue her, &amp; ſhew her as much honor as they might deuiſe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they all agreed: ſo that the day following (knowing that ſhe was neere at hand) <hi>Amadis</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with eight of the beſt knights in King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, mounted on Horſe-backe in very good order. But they had not long ridden when they did behold her a farre off, comming with <hi>Ardan Canila,</hi> who did lead her, &amp; ſhe was apparrelled all in black, mourning as yet for the death of her father, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> had ſlain. This ſad ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell did ſo much grace her, that although of her ſelfe (without any other helpe) ſhe was eſteemed one of the faireſt that might be ſeen, yet was her beauty much more encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by this mourning weede, with the which the liuely whiteneſſe of her face was the more manifeſted, by the grace which this blacke
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7179:208"/>
colour added thereunto, and her two cheeks ſeemed like two white roſes, beautified with a naturall redneſſe, ſo as euen then thoſe which had conceiued a mortall hate againſt her for the miſchiefe which ſhe procured vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> were now forced to loue her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde her marched the twelue gentlewomen, apparrelled with the like attire. After them came the old giant, and his ſon followed with nine knights, which all came as pledges. Great was the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement that <hi>Amadis</hi> ſhewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her and the reſt of her traine, and ſhee in like ſort ſaluted them moſt courteouſly. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> approching more neere, ſaid vnto her, I promiſe you Madame that if you bee accounted faire and of good behauiour it is not without great cauſe, ſeeing that I am now my ſelf an eye witneſſe of the truth thereof, and truly that man ought to thinke himſelfe happy, whoſe ſeruice it ſhal pleaſe you to like of, aſſuring you that I am willing to do you any pleaſure, and ready to obey your commandements: when <hi>Ardan Canila</hi> heard him ſpeake ſo courteouſly (although hee was ſmally fauoured by <hi>Madaſima)</hi> hee was ouercome with iealouſie, and anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> knight ſtand back and ſpeake not ſo priuately vnto her, whom you know not. Sir ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> the cauſe of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither is not onely to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her, but alſo to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vnto her my perſon and my goods. You are no doubt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he ſome good fellow, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be by her greatly imployed, neuertheleſſe faire ſir, get you gone from her, otherwiſe I will make you know that it is not for ſo baſe a companion as you, to vſe ſo great familiarity with a woman of ſo high worth as ſhe is. Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I am anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> yet do I deſire to ſerue her, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your threats, for although I am not of that worth as I would be, yet ſhall nor the affection that I beare vnto her, bee abated by thy malapert boldneſſe. But ſir, you that are ſo luſty, who would make me know my duty &amp; depart from her, for whom willingly I would employ my beſt meanes, tell mee what you are? <hi>Ardan Canila</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding angry, beholding <hi>Amadis</hi> with a ſterne and ſcornefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance anſwered him, I am <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> who am better able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe her welfare and honour in one day, then thou canſt with the beſt meanes thou haſt, doe her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in all thy life. It may very well be ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> notwithſtanding I know that this whereof thou vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhall neuer by thee bee execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo indiſcreete and ſpightfull art thou.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe that thou greatly deſireſt to know whether I am a ſufficient man or nor, know thou that my name is <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> againſt whom thou deſireſt to fight: and if this Lady be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ought that I haue ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, I wil make her ſuch amends therefore as ſhee ſhall pleaſe to command at my hands. By my Gods, anſwered <hi>Ardan Canila,</hi> if thou tarrieſt the combat, the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſhe ſhall take ſhall be thy head. That would diſpleaſe me meruailouſly, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> but I will giue her a head that ſhall bee more welcom to her (if ſhe pleaſe) breaking the marriage of you two, being ſo far vnfit one for another: for ſhe is faire, wiſe, and of courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous behauiour, &amp; thou deformed fooliſh &amp; churliſh, Hereat <hi>Madaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> &amp; the Gentlewomen began all
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7179:208"/>
to laugh, &amp; <hi>Ardan</hi> to be extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angry, that to behold his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and the rage wherein hee was, one might eaſily haue iudged the little good that hee wiſhed to <hi>Amadis,</hi> vnto whom hee anſwered not one word more, yet he ceaſed not grumbling and gnaſhing his teeth vntill hee came before the king. Then very indiſcreetely he began to ſay, King <hi>Liſuart</hi> behold here the knights that muſt now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into your priſon, according to the promiſe which yeſterday a gentlewoman made vnto you, in my behalfe. Wherefore if <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> dare be ſo bold to do as he hath boaſted, I am here ready to breake his head. What will you doe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis?</hi> Thinkeſt thou my heart ſo weake or my right ſo ſmall that I cannot abate the pride of a man ſo audacious as <hi>Ardan</hi> is? I aſſure thee that although I had not vndertaken it, yet would I combat thee onely to hinder the marriage betweene thee and <hi>Madaſima.</hi> And therefore deferre not to deliuer vp theſe hoſtages which thou doeſt brag off, for I verily hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the good and valiant King <hi>Arban,</hi> &amp; <hi>Angriotta,</hi> for the great wrong they haue receiued, during their impriſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment, I haue brought them along with me, ſaid <hi>Ardan,</hi> knowing that you would demand them, but I am in good hope to reſtore them againe into the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the faire <hi>Madaſima,</hi> and to giue her therewithall the mold of thy cap, to teſtifie that it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not ſuch a gallant as thou art to vſe mee with ſuch proude and ſpightfull tearmes, and that (in the executing therof) ſhe may receiue the greater pleaſure, it may pleaſe your king to appoint that ſhe may be ſet in a place hard at hand, to the end that ſhe may both plainely ſee the reuenge that I ſhall take of thee, and alſo the cruell death wherewith thou ſhalt die. At the ſame inſtant the pledges were brought, and the faire <hi>Madaſima</hi> together, with her twelue Gentle-women came to doe their humble duties vnto the Queene, and by her fide was the old Giant, his two ſons, and the nine knights, who all fell vpon their knees before the King. At the ſame time euery one did attentiuely beholde the faire <hi>Madaſima,</hi> who ſhewed ſuch an humble countenance, that ſhe was greatly eſteemed, yet could not <hi>Oriana</hi> caſt one good looke vpon her, thinking that ſhee (of her owne will) did procure the ruine of <hi>Amadis,</hi> for the which none was more ſorrowfull then ſhee. But <hi>Mabila</hi> who was in like ſort neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched with the matter, put her in hope that God would ayde him, and that her Coſin might at eaſily ouerthrow and vanquiſh <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan Canila,</hi> as hee did the prowde <hi>Dardan,</hi> and many other knights, both valiant and ſtout. The pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges then being receiued as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom was, both the knights retired each of them to the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them, ſtaying vntill the time that they ſhould enter into the field, the which the king had commanded to bee cloſed in with pales. Then <hi>Gandalin</hi> went to ſeek his maſters Armour. And as hee would haue taken it downe he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that ſome one had ſtoln his good ſword forth of the ſcabberd, which had almoſt made him die for anger, ſeeing the fault that hee had done vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> towardes whom he ranne, and as one beſide himſelf, he cryed. My Lord, I haue ſo much &amp; ſo grieuouſly offended you, that you haue great reaſon to kill me forthwith. Why? anſwered
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7179:209"/>
                     <hi>Amadis,</hi> art thou fooliſh or mad. My Lord ſaid <hi>Gandalin,</hi> it had beene better for you that I had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ten yeere ago, ſo much I haue deceiued you in your neede, for I haue let your good ſword to bee loſt, the which ſome body hath ſtolne ſince yeſterday, leauing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſcabbard where it did hang. Is this all thou makeſt this great ſtir for? anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> beleeue me I thought (in hearing thee rage in this ſort) that ſome body had beene carrying thy Father to his graue. Go, go, neuer care thou, for I care not ſo much for the goodneſſe thereof, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I did win it ſo honourably as euery one knoweth, and by the meanes of my conſtancy in loue. Yet ſee thou tell no body thereof, but go vnto the Queene and tell her that I intreate her grace, if ſhee haue yet that ſword which <hi>Guillan</hi> found at the fountaine with my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that ſhe will bee pleaſed to ſend it vnto me. And if thou meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Oriana</hi> by chance, tell her alſo that I deſire her to ſet her ſelfe in ſuch a place, where I may behold her at my eaſe, when I ſhall bee in fighting, for I ſhall receiue by her ſight more force by far, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſent I ſhould. So <hi>Gandalin</hi> departed, who did wiſely accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh all that his maſter had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him. And as he returned vnto him, he met with the Queene <hi>Briolania</hi> together with <hi>Oliuda,</hi> who called him and ſaid vnto him, friend <hi>Gandalin,</hi> what doeſt thou thinke thy maſter will doe againſt this deuil, that will fight with him? what anſwered he, my Ladies doe you doubt that he ſhall not do wel enough with him? I am ſure that I haue ſeene him eſcape far greater dangers then this which now hee vndertaketh. God grant hee may ſaid the Ladies. Here withall her came vnto <hi>Amadis</hi> that ſſtayed for him, who hauing the Sword that the Queene did ſend vnto him and being throughly well armed, he mounted on horſeback. And as hee would haue entred into the field, the king met him, and ſaid vnto him, how now my moſt deer friend, this day doe I hope to ſee ſome part of your courage, to the coſt of <hi>Ardan Canila.</hi> In faith if it like your Maieſty anſwered her, there is a great miſchance happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto me, ſome one hath rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed me of the beſt ſword that euer knight did weare. Is it poſſible ſaid the king? Who hath done you this ſhrewd turne? I know not anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> but whoſoeuer hath done it, ſure I am he is not my friend. Truly faid the king, that is likely, but take you no thought therefore, for although that I haue made an oath neuer to lend mine in any combat that is made by two knights in my court, yet am I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for this time to ſtretch my conſcience ſo far as to giue it you. Nay if it like your Maieſty, God forbid that the oath of the beſt king in the world, ſhould be broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for my ſake. What will you then do ſaid the king? The Queen anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> hath done ſo much for me as to keep that ſword which I left at the fountaine of the plaine field, the which <hi>Guillan</hi> did bring with the reſt of my Armour, when I became a Hermit. And it is the very ſelfe ſame which I had, when I was caſt into the Sea, which is ſo fit for the ſcabbard of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is ſtolne, that it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to bee the very ſame. By the faith that I owe vnto God, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the king, I am very glad, for by the vertue of this ſcabbard that is left, you ſhall bee both defended
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7179:209"/>
from ouermuch heat, or too great cold, neuertheleſſe the difference is great betweene the two blades, but God ſhall ſupply this default if it be his pleaſure. And becauſe it is already very late, and that the night approacheth, it were better to deferre the combate vntill to morrow morning. I will ſayde <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> doe whatſoeuer ſhall pleaſe your Maieſty, ſo that <hi>Ardan</hi> bee content. I will goe ſend vnto him anſwered the King, whereunto <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> did eaſily agree, and returned vnto his tents to vnarme himſelfe, afterwards he cauſed diuerſe ſorts of inſtrumens of muſicke to bee brought, &amp; all the night long both he and his neuer ceaſed from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, feaſting, &amp; royalting. But all that while was <hi>Amadis</hi> in the Church deuoutly praying. After hee had like a Chriſtian confeſſed his ſinnes, he beſeeched God to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and ſuccour him, in ſuch ſort continued hee vntill about day breake, when he withdrew him to his lodging, where ſhortly after the King came vnto him with a great troop of knights. Who after they had bidden him good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, they armed him, and brought him with great triumph vnto the Cathedrall Church to heare ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, &amp; at his returne from thence <hi>Floreſtan</hi> preſented him with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent faire courſer, which <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanda</hi> had ſent vnto him not long before. Then euery one got to horſebacke to accompanie him to the field. And <hi>Floreſtan</hi> carried <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> his Launce, <hi>Brunco</hi> his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and <hi>Agraies</hi> his ſhield, before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did the King ride with a white truncheon in his hand, he rode on a Spaniſh I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the City, and many ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were already ſtanding all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the barriers, &amp; the gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Damoſels placed in the windowes. In this ſort did <hi>Amadis</hi> enter into the field, into the which he was no ſooner come but that he did his dutie vnto the Ladies, and amongſt them all he ſpied out <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> who the more toencreaſe his courage did put her head forth of the window. And ſmiling kindely vpon him, ſhe made a ſigne vnto him that he ſhould ſomethings do for her loue, wherwith <hi>Amadis</hi> did imagine that all the force in the world was at that inſtant placed round about his heart, and hee thought that <hi>Ardan Canila</hi> ſtayed too long before hee came. In the meane time he buckled on his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met &amp; retyred to that part of the field where they appointed. Iudges were ſeated, which were <hi>Don Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan, Quedragant,</hi> &amp; <hi>Brandoinas.</hi> And ſhortly after came <hi>Ardan</hi> in richly armed, mounted vpon a great ſtrong horſe, and hee had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his neck a ſhield of fine ſteele ſhining as bright as burning glaſſe. At his ſide did hang the good ſworde of <hi>Amadis,</hi> holding in his hand a great huge Launce, the which he weelded ſo ſtrongly, that notwithſtanding the thickneſſe thereof, hee ſhaked it with ſuch force, that he made it double in his fiſt. Whereat <hi>Oriana, Mabila,</hi> and the other Ladies beholding the ſterne countenance of <hi>Ardan</hi> (as it often happeneth in thoſe things which one feareth to to loſe) they beganne to bee in doubt of him whom they all fauoured, ſo as <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> ſayd: Alas if God take not pittie vpon <hi>Amadis,</hi> this day will be his laſt. But <hi>Mabila</hi> preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued her ſaying: Madam, if you ſhew not a pleaſant countenance vnto my Coſen, hee ſhall be eaſily

vanquiſhed, although <hi>Ardan</hi> ſtrike neuer a ſtroke. Hereupon the trumpets ſounded. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> beholding <hi>Oriana,</hi> ſet ſpurres vnto his horſe, and they both met ſo rudely, that their Launces were broken into ſhiuers, encountring together with their ſhieldes &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſo forcibly, that <hi>Ardan</hi> his horſe fell down dead in the place, and the other of <hi>Amadis</hi> had his ſhoulder broken, neuertheleſſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> with great lightneſſe roſe vp, although the truncheon of his enemies Lance remained ſticking in his vambraces, the which hee preſently pulled forth, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his ſword, hee valiantly marched againſt <hi>Ardan Canila,</hi> who in like ſort with great paine was riſen vp. And as hee ſtayed to mend his helmet which was ſome-what ſhaken with his fall, ſeeing his enemy approach, hee made head againſt him, and there began betweene them ſo cruell an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, as there was not any man preſent that did not greatly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereat, for with the ſparkles of fire which preceeded by their ſtroakes from their helmets, they ſeemed to bee all on fire, and by their waighty blowes which with great proweſſe were beſtowed, they manifeſted the hate which they did beare vnto each other, for there was not one blowe ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but the blood followed, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe it ſeemed that <hi>Ardan</hi> had the aduantage ouer his enemy, as well becauſe of the ſhield of ſteele which he had, as alſo for the hurt which hee did with the ſword of <hi>Amadis,</hi> which the iniurious Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell had giuen him. But yet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> followed him ſo neare, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes hee brought him out of breath, wherewith <hi>Ardan</hi> was much abaſhed, and hee verly thought that in all his life hee had not found a knight that handled him ſo rudely, eſpecially hee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined his enemies force to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled when moſt of all his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired. Whereat as it were diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that hee ſhould ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, couering him with his ſhield, hee ran vpon <hi>Amadis,</hi> who had all his armour and ſhield in ſuch ſort hacked and broken, that he could not wel tel wherewith to defend him any more, becauſe that <hi>Ardan</hi> neuer faſtened blowe vpon him but that his fleſh felt it, whereby euery one iudged that he would carry away the victory. Then was <hi>Madaſima</hi> very ſorry hereat, for ſhe was a woman of ſo ſtout a heart that ſhe would rather haue loſt her land and herſelfe then to marry him, and ſo long theſe two knights maintained the combate, that euery one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But <hi>Oriana</hi> ſeeing the pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eſtate of <hi>Amadis</hi> and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger whereunto hee was brought, by the reaſon that his armour was ſo broken, ſhe was likely to haue ſounded, &amp; ſhe became very pale and out of heart, vntill <hi>Mabila</hi> perceiuing it, ſayd vnto her. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame it is no time now to leaue <hi>Amadis</hi> in this perill, ſeeing that if you turne your backe, you haſten his end, and depriue him of his victory, at the leaſt if you cannot beholde him, turne your fate quite from him. At that time was <hi>Amadis</hi> ſo ſorely preſſed by <hi>Ardan</hi> that <hi>Brandoinas</hi> one of the iudges ſayd vnto <hi>Grumenan,</hi> and <hi>Quedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,</hi> Truely my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> is in great neceſſity for want of good armour, ſee how his ſhield is hacked, &amp; his haubert ſo broken, that in a maner he hath nor where-withall to defend one blowe.

Truſt mee you ſay true anſwered <hi>Grumedan,</hi> and I am very ſorry for it. Of my faith ſayd <hi>Quedragant,</hi> I haue prooued <hi>Amadis</hi> when I ſought with him, but the longer he fighteth, the ſtronger and more inuincible hee waxeth, ſo that it ſeemeth each houre his force in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, the which is not ſo with <hi>Ardan,</hi> as by proofe you may now ſee by his vnweeldineſſe, &amp; more ſhall you ſee before the battaile be ended. This ſpeech was heard by <hi>Oriana</hi> and <hi>Mabila,</hi> where-with they were greatly comforted, and becauſe he had ſeene <hi>Oriana</hi> almoſt ready to depart from the window, not daining any longer to behold him, hee thought ſhee was diſpleaſed, for that hee defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo long to get the victorie of his enemy. Whereat hee was ſo grieued, that griping his ſworde faſt in his fiſt, hee ſtroke ſo ſound a blow vpon the helmet of <hi>Ardan,</hi> that hee made him bowe one knee to the ground, but by miſchance his ſword broke in three peeces, the leaſt whereof remained in his hand. Then did hee thinke his life in very great danger, &amp; there was not any of the beholders that did not ſuppoſe him vanquiſhed, and <hi>Ardan</hi> victor: who began to lift vp his arme, ſaying ſo loud that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one did heare: behold <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> the good ſworde which with wrong thou gotteſt, by the which thou ſhalt receiue a ſhamefull death. See gentle Ladies ſee, look forth of your windowes, to behold my Lady <hi>Madaſima</hi> reuenged, and ſay whether I am not worthy of her loue. When <hi>Madaſima</hi> heard <hi>Ardan</hi> make this bragge, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that without doubt fortune fauoured him, ſo as according to the promiſe which her mother had made vnto him, ſhe ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to take him for her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſhee came and caſt herſelfe at the feete of the Queene, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching her moſt humbly that it would pleaſe her grace to hinder this marriage, the which ſhe might iuſtly doe, becauſe that <hi>Ardan</hi> had ſayd vnto her that if hee got not the victory of <hi>Amadis</hi> in leſſe ſpace then the beſt lackie in the world could run halfe a league, that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent that ſhe ſhould neuer loue him ſo long as ſhe liued, and that now it was more then foure houres ſince the combate began. Gentle Lady anſwered the Queen, I will doe that which ſhall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. In the meane time <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> was much aſtoniſhed, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hee had no meanes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelfe, he began to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that which <hi>Vrganda</hi> had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told him, which was that if hee were Lord of halfe the world, hee would giue it vpon condition that his ſworde were in the bottom of ſome deepe lake.

By meanes whereof, hee either determined to die ſpeedily, or to be reuenged vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his enemy ſuddenly, and the better to execute his determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee leaped vnto his enemy ſo lightly, that before <hi>Ardan</hi> could ſtrike him, hee pulled the ſhield from his necke, and then ſtepping alittle aſide, he took vp a trunche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Lance, that lay in the field, and hee thought to haue thruſt it thorough the ſight of <hi>Ardan</hi> his helmet: but hee went backe, and lifting vp his ſworde hee ſtroke ſo ſtreat a blowe within the ſhield which <hi>Amadis</hi> did hold, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

it was of fine ſteele, yet did it enter therein more then a great hand breadth. And as hee ſtriued to pull it forth, <hi>Amadis</hi> thruſt the head of the truncheon through his arme, wherewith hee felt ſuch extreme grief, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke the ſword which hee held, on the which <hi>Amadis</hi> preſently faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened his hand, &amp; pulled it forth, thanking God for ayding him in his greateſt need. When <hi>Mabila</hi> beheld the caſe thus altered, ſhee called <hi>Oriana,</hi> who hauing ſeen her friend in ſuch extreamity, was newly layd downe vpon a bed, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying with her ſelfe what death ſhe might chuſe for the ſpeedieſt, if <hi>Amadis</hi> were vanquiſhed. And <hi>Mabila</hi> ſayd vnto her, Madame, come ſee how God hath holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, <hi>Ardan</hi> (without doubt) is ouer-come. The great ioy which <hi>Oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> receiued at theſe newes made her ſuddenly to ſtart vp, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of the window, ſhee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued how <hi>Amadis</hi> had ſtroken his enemy ſo mighty a blow vpon the ſhoulder, that hee ſeparated it from his necke, wherewith he felt ſuch anguiſh, that hee turned his backe, but hee ran not farre before <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtroke him againe, and he purſued him ſo ſharpely, as that hee made him recoyle backe euen to the top of a Rocke, againſt the which the Sea did beat, ſo that he could goe no farther. Then was <hi>Arda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Canila</hi> brought between two extreamities, for on the one ſide the deepe and vnmercifull waues ſet before his eyes his vnhappy end, on the other ſide hee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſharpe ſword of his enemy which did no leſſe terrifie him Who purſued him ſo cloſe, that he pulled his helmet from his head, and lifting vp his arme hee woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him moſt cruelly, ſo that hee fell from the top of the Rocke downe into the Sea, and was ne-uer after ſeene. For the which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny praiſed God, eſpeciall king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> of <hi>Northwales,</hi> and <hi>Angriotta de Eſtrauaux,</hi> becauſe they had ſeen <hi>Amadis</hi> in ſuch daunger that they greatly ſtood in feare of his ſafety. Heerewithall <hi>Amadis</hi> wiping his ſword did put it vp into his ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, and came whereas the King and the other knights were, who in great triumph brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his lodging, and the more to honour him, hee was led between thoſe whom hee had deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cruell priſon, that is to ſay, by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> King of <hi>Northwales,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griotta de Eſtrauaux.</hi> And becauſe they were leane, pale, and almoſt ſpent, as well with the euill vſage which they had receiued during their impriſonment, as alſo with the griefe and melancholly that they had taken, <hi>Amadis</hi> was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that they ſhould lodge in his chamber, where they were ſo well tended and dyeted, by the aid of expert Phyſitions and cunning Surgeons, that they did ſhortly after recouer their health, as by the ſequell of our Hiſtory you may vnderſtand.</p>

                     <p>How <hi>Brunco de Bonne Mer</hi> did fight with <hi>Madamaine</hi> the ambitions, brother to the Damoſell iniurious, and of the accuſations that were made by ſome of the enemies of <hi>Amadis</hi> vnto the King, for which cauſe hee and many others (that were deſirous to follow him) departed from the Court.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next day after the combate was ended between <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Ardan</hi> (as hath beene related heretofore) the iniurious Damoſell came and preſented herſelfe before the king, beſeeching his Maieſty to ſend him that ſhould fight with her brother, whom according vnto promiſe ſhee had cauſed to come thither. For (ſayd the Damoſell) although my brother be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and cannot take that reuenge of his enemies as the friends of <hi>Ardan</hi> may reſt ſatisfied for his death, yet will it bee ſome ſmall comforth vnto them notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Now <hi>Brunco:</hi> was there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who (without making ſtay, anſwered to the raſh ſpeeches of the fooliſh woman) ſaid vnto the the King. If it like your Maieſty, I am the man ſhe ſpeaketh of, and ſeeing that her brother is come hither as ſhee ſaith, if it be your pleaſure and his will, wee ſhall quickly know if hee be ſuch a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant as hee vaunteth. Vnto the which the King condiſcended. Wherefore they both went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to arme them, and anon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they entred into the field, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were accompanied with certaine knights their friends. They beeing then in the place aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for that purpoſe, the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſounded to warne them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the combate. Forthwith they charged their Launces, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſpurres to their horſes, they ranne the one againſt the other ſuch force that their Launces flew into ſhiuers, &amp; encountring each other with their ſhieldes and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, <hi>Madamain</hi> loſt his ſtirrops, and was vnhorſed, &amp; <hi>Brunco</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the left ſide. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo ſoone as hee had finiſhed his carreer, hee turned himſelfe to his enemy, and ſaw that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready recouered his feet, and held his ſword in his hand in a readines to defend himſelfe: but as <hi>Brunco</hi> drew neere to charge him, he ſayd to him: Sir knight alight, or elſe aſſure you that I will kill your horſe. Truely ſayd <hi>Brunco,</hi> at your choyce bee it, for it is all one to me, to ouercome you on foote or on horſebacke. When <hi>Madamain</hi> ſaw that his wiſh came to a good end, being as he thouhgt ſtronger then his enemy, who was but little, and himſelfe in a manner a Gyant, he was moſt glad thereof, and ſayd to <hi>Brunco,</hi> It were better for you to alight, and then you ſhould ſoon make profe whether you were able to effect that which you make brags of: well quoth <hi>Brunco,</hi> &amp; ſo withdrawing himſelfe he alighted &amp; left his horſe, then he tooke his ſhield &amp; ſet hand to his ſword, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching vnto <hi>Madamain,</hi> who like a valiant &amp; ſtout knight recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him coragiouſly. They began to lay on load the one at the other both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pretending to get the victory, which was the cauſe that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7179:212"/>
neither ſhield nor armour of how good temper ſoeuer, was able to withſtand their blowes, for they hacked them to peeces, ſo that the field in many places was couered with peeces of their ſhields. Now if the knights did aſſaile one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with great hardineſſe, their horſes did no leſſe, for they ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon one another, and with their feete and teeth fighting together, they did ioyne in ſuch ſort, that the moſt part of the lookers on, were more intentiue to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the beaſts, then the fight of the knights. Notwithſtanding <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damain</hi> his horſe in the ende had the worſe, being conſtrained to leape ouer the barriers, and to run away. This gaue a great preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to euery man to imagine that <hi>Brunco</hi> ſhould obtaine the victory, and ſo it fell out, for hee purſued <hi>Madamain</hi> ſo neere, and brought him to that extreamity, that being almoſt out of breath, he ſayd vnto <hi>Brunco.</hi> I doe beleeue conſidering the rage thou art in, that thou ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineſt the day will not bee long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to end our quarrell. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, if thou doeſt conſider, that thy armour is almoſt vnriuited, thou ſhalt finde that it were better for thee to reſt thy ſelfe, then to aſſaile mee ſo vndiſcreetly as thou doeſt, and therefore I being vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to vſe thee ſo rigourouſly as thou deſerueſt, I am content to giue thee leaue to take breath, that we may afterwards begin the fight more hotly then before. <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nco</hi> anſwered, thou declareſt in plaine tearmes that which is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for thy ſelfe. Wherefore I pray thee as luſtie as thou art, not to ſpare mee a whit. Art thou ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the occaſion of our combate? Knoweſt thou not that either thy head or mine muſt ceaſe this ſtrife? I doe aſſure thee that I am no more determined to liſten vnto thy preaching: wherefore if thou determine not to dy preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, looke to thine owne defence, better then thou haſt done here-tofore. Immediately without any further diſputations hee aſſailed <hi>Madamain</hi> afreſh, but hee was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſo weake (as not being able ſo much as to defend <hi>Brunco</hi> his blowes) hee drew himſelfe by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little to the top of a Rock, euen to the place where <hi>Amadis</hi> had caſt the body of <hi>Ardan</hi> into the Sea. And there <hi>Brunco</hi> thruſt him ſo rudely downe, that he ſent him to be buried in the Sea, but before hee came to the bottome, his body was torne in twenty ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall peeces. Which the iniurious Damoſell perceiuing, ſhe entred into ſuch fury and diſpaire, that as a mad woman ſhee ranne vnto the place where <hi>Ardan</hi> and <hi>Madamain</hi> were throwne downe headlond, where finding <hi>Madamain</hi> his ſword, ſhe ſet it to her breaſt, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo loud that all the companie heard her, Seeing that <hi>Ardan</hi> the flower of chiualrie, &amp; my brother haue choſen their graue in this raging Sea, I will beare them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie. And ſo caſting herſelfe downe headlong, ſhe was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately couered with the water. Then <hi>Brunco</hi> (mounting on horſe-backe againe) was conducted by the King and many other knights to the lodging of <hi>Amadis,</hi> where hee deſired to keep him company, in whoſe honour hee had vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the combate. And becauſe that the Queene <hi>Briolania</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that <hi>Amadis</hi> was not like to be cured in a ſhort ſpace, nor to accompany her as hee had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhe tooke her leaue of him to goe ſee the ſingularities of the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7179:212"/>
Firme-Iſland, wherefore <hi>Amadis</hi> commanded <hi>Enil</hi> to conduct her, and to deſire <hi>Iſania</hi> the Gouernor thereof, to doe her all the honour, and giue her the beſt entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hee could deuiſe. So <hi>Briola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> departed, bidding <hi>Oriana</hi> fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, aſſuring her that ſhe ſhould be aduertiſed what happened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her in trying the aduentures of the Iſland, but ſhee was no ſooner gone from the Court, when it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that Fortune endeauoured the ruine of the kingdom of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> which bad ſo long time liued in happineſſe. Yea euen king <hi>Liſuart</hi> himſelfe, who (forgetting not onely the ſeruices hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of <hi>Amadis,</hi> of his kindred and friends, but eſpecially the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and counſell of <hi>Vrganda)</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to flatterers, two ancient knights of his houſe, to whom (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour of the long educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had receiued, as well of the King <hi>Falangris</hi> his eldeſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as of himſelfe) hee gaue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, beleeuing their vntrothes which he ought not to haue done, as you ſhall preſently vnderſtand. Theſe two of whom I ſpeake as wel by reaſon of their ancient age, as of a kinde of hypocriſie, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with wiſedome, tooke more paines to ſeeme good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then to bee ſo in deede, by meanes whereof they entred into great authority, and were often-times called and made priuie to the moſt ſecret affaires of their Lord, one of them was named <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadan,</hi> and the other <hi>Gandandell.</hi> This <hi>Gandandell</hi> had two ſonnes, who before the comming of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and of his followers into great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> were eſteemed two of the moſt hardieſt knights in all the countrey, notwithſtanding the proweſſe and dexteritie of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did abate the renowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of thoſe whom I ſpeake of.

                     </gap>y our royall Maieſty, I ſhould commit a great fault both towardes God and men. In conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof if it like your Maieſty, after I had long weighed with my ſelfe that which I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you, I haue often repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that I deferred the matter ſo long, not for any malice I beare vnto any man (as God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) but onely for the damage which I ſee ready to enſue, if your Maieſty do not ſpeedily and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeke remedy to preuent it. Your Maieſty knoweth that of long time there hath beene great controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie betweene the kingdomes of <hi>Gaule</hi> and great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> becauſe that the Kings your predeceſſors, haue alwaies pretended title of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7179:213"/>
ſoueraigntie thereunto. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that for ſome time this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell hath linedead, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it is likely that thoſe of that Countrey (calling to minde the warres and domages they haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by your ſubiects) haue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly determined to take reuenge thereof. And in my opinion, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> who is chiefe and principall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all, is not come into this Countrey, but to practiſe and gaine your people: who (ioyned with the forces which he may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly land heere) will ſo trouble you, that it will be hard for you to reſiſt them. And I beſeech you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whither the likelyhood there-of bee not already very apparent. Moreouer your Maieſtie may bee pleaſed to conſider that he of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſpeake, and thoſe of his aliance likewiſe, haue done mee ſo much honour and pleaſure, that both I and my children are greatly boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnto them, and were it not that you are my ſoueraigne Lord. I would in no wiſe pleake againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> but in thoſe things which concerne your perſon, let mee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receiue death, then that I ſpare any man liuing were he mine own ſonne. You haue receiued <hi>Amadis</hi> with ſo great number of his parents and other ſtrangers into your Court (like a good and liberall Prince as you are) that in the end, their traine will become greater then your owne, wherefore if it like your Maieſty, it were good to fore-ſee this matter before the fire bee kindled any further. When the King heard <hi>Gandandel</hi> ſpeake in this ſort, he became very penſiue, and afterwards anſwered him: In faith louing friend, I beleeue that you aduertiſe mee as a good and faithfull ſubiect, neuertheleſſe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeruices that they of whom you ſpeake haue done vnto me, I cannot be perſwaded in my mind, that they would procure or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any treaſon againſt me. May it pleaſe your Maieſty, anſwered he, that is it which deceiueth you, for if they had heretofore offended you, you would haue beene ware of them as of your enemies, but they can wiſely cloake their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended treaſon, colouring it with an humble ſpeech, accompanied with ſome ſmall ſeruices, wherein they haue employed themſelues, watching a time of more fit oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. The King turned his head on the one ſide without anſwering any farther, becauſe there came ſome Gentlemen vnto him, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe <hi>Gandandel</hi> being as yet ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant how the King had taken his aduertiſement, he practiſed with <hi>Brocadan,</hi> and drew him vnto his league, declaring vnto him the whole diſcourſe which he had with the King, aſſuring him that if they might baniſh <hi>Amadis</hi> and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that from thenceforth they two alone ſhould gouerne the king and his Realme peacebly. <hi>Brocadan</hi> receiuing this counſell for good, did afterwards imprint in the King his minde ſo great iealoſie, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition againſt <hi>Amadis</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, as from that day hee hated them in ſo ſtrange a ſort, that hee could not in a manner abide to ſee them, forgetting the great ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces performed by them, as well when he and <hi>Oriana</hi> were deliuered from the hands of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the battaile againſt King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> and in many other places heretofore recited. Truely if this King had well remembred the counſell and aduiſe which hee had receiued of <hi>Vrganda,</hi> hee had not ſo farre digreſſed from the bounds of reaſon, although that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7179:213"/>
the like malady doth often haunt al Princes, when they take not heed of falling into the like accidents and danger as King <hi>Liſuart</hi> did. Who giuing credit to the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words of theſe traitors, did ne-uer afterwards viſit (as hee was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed) <hi>Amadis</hi> and the others that were wounded, whereat they were not a little abaſhed, but to doe them the more diſpite he ſent for <hi>Madaſima</hi> and other pledges, vnto whom he ſayde, that if within eight dayes the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza</hi> were not yeelded vnto him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their promiſe, that then hee would ſuddainly cauſe their heads to be ſmitten off. When <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſima</hi> heard this rigorous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, neuer was woman more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, conſidering, that in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the will of the King, ſhee ſhould remaine poore and vtterly diſhereted, and on the other ſide, denying to ſatisfie his beheſt, ſhee did ſee her death prepared, ſo that ſhe was in ſuch perplexitie, as not being able to anſwere him, ſhe had recourſe vnto her teares. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Andangell</hi> the old Gyant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the King, ſaying. If it pleaſe your Maieſtie, I will go with thoſe whom you ſhall appoint to ſend, vnto the mother of <hi>Madaſima,</hi> and I will deale with her in that ſort, as ſhee ſhall accompliſh your will, yeelding the Countrey and places which you demand, otherwiſe your Maieſtie may doe your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with vs. This the King liked well of, and euen that day he ſent him with the Earle <hi>Latin,</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her women to bee carryed back to their accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med priſon, whether they were brought by diuers Gentlemen. Whom ſhe moued greatly to pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie her eſtate, by the complaints and ſorrowfull lamentation that ſhe made vnto them, praying eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them particularly to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in her behalfe vnto the King, ſo that there was not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all, who promiſed not to doe for her as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they could, eſpecially <hi>Don Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanes,</hi> who at that time held her by the arme, beholding her with ſuch an eye, as hee became of her ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured, and ſaid vnto her: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, I am ſure that if it would pleaſe you to accept mee for your husband, the King would freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon vs all the right that he pretendeth in your Countrey. I beleeue alſo that you are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of my nobility, being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that by me your authoritie ſhall not be deminiſhed. For the reſt, aſſure your ſelfe that I will vſe you as you are worthy. Now <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima</hi> had known him of long time, &amp; ſhe was aſſured that he was one of the beſt Knights in the world. Wherefore accepting the offers of <hi>Galuanes,</hi> ſhee fell downe at his feete, moſt humbly thanking him for the good and honour which he did offer vnto her, and euen then was the marriage betweene them agreed vpon, the which afterward <hi>Galuanes</hi> laboured to effect to his vttermoſt power. And the better to accompliſh it, ſome few dayes after he came vnto <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies,</hi> making them acquainted with that which you haue heard, and <hi>Agraies</hi> ſaid vnto him: Vnkle, I know very well that loue hath no reſpect of perſons, ſparing neither young nor olde, and ſeeing that you are become one of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, we will beſeech the King ſo much in your behalfe, that you ſhall enioy your deſired loue, therefore determine to behaue your ſelfe like a luſty champion for
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7179:214"/>
                     <hi>Madaſima</hi> is a woman, not likely to bee pleaſed with a kiſſe onely By my faith (anſwered <hi>Amadis)</hi> my Lord <hi>Galuanes,</hi> the King in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, will not refuſe vs, and I promiſe you that ſo ſoone as I am able to walke, your Nephew and I will goe vnto his Maieſty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat that which you demand. But you muſt vnderſtand that whileſt theſe things were in doing, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> the better to couer &amp; diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the treaſon which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, did goe oftentimes to ſee and viſit <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſo that one time amongſt the reſt hee ſayd to him: my Lord, it is long ſince you ſaw the King. What is the cauſe there-of anſwered <hi>Amadis?</hi> Becauſe ſaide <hi>Gandandel,</hi> by his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it ſeemeth hee beareth you no great good will. I know not anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> yet to my knowledge I neuer offended him. For this time they paſſed no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vntill at another inſtant this traytour came againe to ſee him, ſhewing vnto him a better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance then he was accuſtomed, ſaying: my Lord, I told you the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, that I thought by the ſpeeches which I heard the King ſpeake of you, that his friendſhip was not ſo firme vnto you as it was wont to be, and becauſe that I and mine are ſo greatly bound vnto you, for the pleaſures which you haue done vnto vs, I will tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let you vnderſtand how the King hath a very bad opinion of you, and therefore looke vnto it. So many times did hee repeat this and the like matter vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> that hee began to ſuſpect leaſt hee had layd ſome ſnare to entrap him in, whereby the King might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſome euill opinion of him. And therefore one day when <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandel</hi> perſeuered in his aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Amadis</hi> being very angry, anſwered him: My Lord <hi>Gandan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> I doe greatly wonder what mooueth you to vſe this ſpeech ſo often vnto me, ſeeing that I did neuer thinke vpon any thing but onely wherein I might doe the King ſeruice? And I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that a Prince ſo vertuous as hee is, would euer ſuſpect mee for a thing which I neuer committed. Wherefore neuer breake my head more with ſuch follies, for I take no pleaſure therein. For this cauſe <hi>Gandandel</hi> durſt neuer after that ſpeake any more thereof vnto him, vntill that <hi>Amadis</hi> beeing healed, went vnto the Court, but ſo ſoone as the King beheld him hee turned his head from him &amp; his fellowes, not vouchſafing ſo much as once to looke vpon them. Then <hi>Gandan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> who was hard by them ſeeing the Kings countenance, came to embrace <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſaying vnto him, that hee was glad of his recouery. But by my faith ſayd he, I am very ſory that the king vſeth you no bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, notwithſtanding now you may know whether the aduertiſements that I gaue you were falſe or nor. <hi>Amadis</hi> anſwered him not one word, but came vnto <hi>Angriota</hi> &amp; <hi>Brunco,</hi> who thinking that hee had not marked the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance which the King ſhewed vnto them, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed him thereof. There is no cauſe anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> that you ſhould take it in ill part, ſeeing that very often a man is intentiue vnto ſome thing whereon his minde is ſet, that hee taketh no heed vnto that which others doe, it may be that the king muſed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſome other matter when wee ſaluted him, therefore let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and ſpeake vnto his Maieſty for that which <hi>Galuanes</hi> entreated vs. Here withall they approached
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7179:214"/>
vnto him, and <hi>Amadis</hi> ſayde vnto the King. Although, if it pleaſe your Maieſtie, that I haue not here-tofore done you that ſeruice that I deſire, yet haue I preſumed (truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your good bounty) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt one gift of your highneſſe, which can not but turne greatly to your honour, moreouer you ſhall binde thoſe vnto your Maieſtie, whom you may pleaſure with your gacious grant. At this time was <hi>Gandandel</hi> preſent, who playing the hypocrite (as he was accuſtomed) very malapertly took vpon him to ſpeake, and anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if it bee ſo as you ſay, the King ought not to denie your ſute. If it like your highneſſe, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> the gift which I and my fellowes here preſent, do beſech your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to grant vnto vs, is, that it would pleaſe you to beſtow vpon the Lord <hi>Galuanes</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza,</hi> for the which he ſhall yeeld you fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and homage, in marying with <hi>Madaſima,</hi> by the which fauour your grace ſhall both aduance a poore Prince, and extend your pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vnto one of the faireſt Gentle-women in the world. When <hi>Broca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> and <hi>Gandandel</hi> heard this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they looked vpon the King, making a ſigne vnto him that hee ſhould not grant it to them. Yet ne-uertheleſſe it was a great while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſpake, conſidering the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts of <hi>Don Galuanes,</hi> and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices which hee had receiued of him in many places, eſpecially how that <hi>Amadis</hi> had conquered with the price of his blood, the land which he required for another, ne-uertheleſſe hee gaue no eare vnto him, although by verture hee was bounden to condiſcend vnto a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt ſo reſonable, yet hee thus anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That man is ill aduiſed who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſteth a thing that cannot bee granted. I ſpeake this becauſe of you my Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> who doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate mee for that which within theſe fiue dayes I haue beſtowed, as a gift vpon my youngeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Leonor.</hi> This excuſe had the King fayned of ſet purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe <hi>Galuanes,</hi> whereupon <hi>Amadis</hi> who was greatly diſcontented with the ſlender entertainment that he ſhewed vnto them, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this was but an excuſe, hee could not ſo much command him-ſelfe as to hold his peace, but that he ſaid vnto the King. Your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie doth very well manifeſt that the ſeruices which for you we haue done, haue beene little pleaſing vnto you, and leſſe profitable for vs. And therefore (if theſe my companions will bee ruled by me) wee will hence-forth bethinke vs what to doe. Beleeue me my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, anſwered <hi>Galuanes,</hi> you ſay true, and thoſe ſeruices are very ill imployed, which are done vnto thoſe that haue no deſire to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them, and therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man of courage ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware for whom he aduenture him-ſelfe. My Lords, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> blame not the King for nor gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that which hee hath promiſed vnto another, and let vs onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him that he will be pleaſed to permit that <hi>Galuanes</hi> may marry with <hi>Madaſima.</hi> And if he grant this fauour, I will giue vnto him the Firme-Iſland. <hi>Madaſima</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the King) is my priſoner, and if ſhe deliuer not vnto mee the land which ſhe hath promiſed me, ſhee ſhall loſe her head before the moneth be paſt.</p>
                  <p>By my faith, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> had your Maieſtie anſwered vs more kindly, you had done vs no wrong at all, if at the leaſt you had a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7179:215"/>
deſire in any ſort to thinke well of vs. If my entertainement like you not anſwered the King, the world is large enough to finde out ſome other, that may vſe you better. Truely this word hardly digeſted, turned afterward into a greater conſequence, then the King thought it would, who perceiued ſhortly after by <hi>Brocadan</hi> and his companion, how hurtfull a thing, hatefull and vncourteous ſpeech is, as the forgetting of good and his honour, is oftentimes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow both of a king and realm <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſo diſpleaſed with this farewell, that he ſaid vnto the king. If it like your Maieſty, I haue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto thought that there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King nor Prince in the world more indued with vertuous and honourable qualities then you, ne-uertheleſſe we now by proofe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the contrary. Therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you haue changed your anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent good cuſtome, by the aduiſe of ſome latter bad counſell, wee will goe ſeeke out another manner of life. Do anſwered the king, what you will, for you know my minde. Saying ſo, hee roſe vp in a great rage, and went vnto the Queene, vnto whom he imparted the whole diſcourſe that he had with <hi>Amadis</hi> and his companions, and how hee was diſpatched of them, where-with hee was very glad. I am in great doubt ſaid the Queene, leaſt this your pleaſure doe not hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter turne you to diſpleaſure, for you are not ignorant, from the firſt day that <hi>Amadis</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federats entred into your ſeruice, how your affaires haue alwaies proſpered better and better, ſo as if you conſider that which they haue done for you, you ſhall finde that they haue deſerued no ſuch anſwere as you haue made vnto them. Beſides when it ſhall bee manifeſt vnto others what they both haue done and can doe, and the little account you doe make of them for their deſerts, they may hereafter hope for no better at your handes, and therefore will they deſiſt to employ themſelues for you, reputing them fooles, that ſhall do but the leaſt ſeruice for ſo vngratefull a man. Tell mee no more of it ſaid the king, for it is done, but if they make their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint vnto you, tel them that long ſince I haue giuen that land which they required of me to our daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Leonor,</hi> as I did tell them. I will doe it anſwered the Queene, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is your pleaſure, and God grant that all may turne to the beſt.</p>
                  <p>But you muſt vnderſtand, that after <hi>Amadis</hi> and thoſe in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had ſeene in what ſort the King had left them, they went forth of the Palace, and as they went to their lodging they concluded to ſay nothing thereof vnto their friends vntill the next morning, againſt which time they would pray them all to meete together, and that then they would take counſell what was beſt to be done. And at the ſame inſtant <hi>Amadis</hi> ſent <hi>Durin</hi> to tell the Princeſſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bila</hi> that he would (if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) the night following ſpeake with <hi>Oriana</hi> about ſome matter of importance newly fallen out. In this ſort the day paſſed, and the night approched, being alreadie apparrelled in his ſable weede: wherefore at ſuch time as euery one was in their ſoundeſt ſleepe, <hi>Amadis</hi> called <hi>Gandalin,</hi> and came vnto that place by the which hee commonly entred into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Oriana,</hi> who ſtayed for him according to the meſſage which
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7179:215"/>
ſhee had receiued by <hi>Durin,</hi> where being arriued, without acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her at the firſt with any thing that might diſpleaſe her, after they had a little while diſcourſed plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly together, <hi>Mabila</hi> &amp; the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell of <hi>Denmark</hi> (who were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſleep, or it may be not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to endure that heat where-with loue did pricke them, ſeeing the kiſſings &amp; embracings where-with theſe two louers entertained one another) ſayd vnto them, the bed is bigge enough for you two, and the darkneſſe fit for your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, it is now late, lie you downe if it pleaſe you, and afterwardes talke together as much as you wil. Madame ſaid <hi>Amadis</hi> vnto <hi>Oriana,</hi> by my faith their counſell is very good. It is beſt for vs then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them anſwered ſhee, and therewithall hauing nothing vpon her but a cloake caſt about her, ſhe had quickly gotten her in between a paire of ſheets, and as ſhee layd her downe cloſe in her bed, hee lent ſo neere vnto her ouer the beds ſide, that after the curtains were drawne (not to encreaſe his paſſion, but to redouble his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) a wax taper being onely ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp in the chamber, they began to kiſſe and embrace each other ſo inceſſantly, that remaining in this great eaſe, their ſpirits entertained a double delight, by the ſweet ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace which their metamorphoſed ſoules did mutially receiue from the outward parts of their lippes, being brought at the ſame inſtant into ſuch an extaſie, that they were thereby vnable to ſpeake one worde, vntill the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> (thinking that <hi>Amadis</hi> had beene aſleepe) pulled him by the garment, ſaying. My Lord you may lightly take colde, get you into the bed if it pleaſe you. With this waking as it were forth of a ſound ſleepe, hee fetched a deepe ſigh. Alas deare loue ſayd the Princeſſe, ſhould you not be as well at your eaſe if you were laid downe in the bed by mee, as to take ſo much paine and hurt your ſelfe. Madame (anſwered he) ſeeing it pleaſeth you ſo to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me, I will not make it dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſtraine a little curteſie with you.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner had hee ſayde theſe wordes, but that hee threwe him-ſelfe ſtarke naked betweene the Princeſſe her armes, then begunne they againe their amorous ſports, performing with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment that thing which euery one in the like delight doth moſt deſire: after-wardes they began to conferre of diuers matters, vntill that <hi>Oriana</hi> dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of him wherefore he had ſent her word by <hi>Durin</hi> that he had ſomewhat of great importance to tell her. Madam anſwered he, I wil declare it vnto you, ſeing that you deſire to know it, although I am ſure it will be both ſtrange &amp; grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto you, neuertheles I muſt of neceſſity aduertiſe you thereof, becauſe it is of ſo great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. You muſt vnderſtand therefore Madame, that the King your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yeſterday did ſpeake vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies, Galuanes,</hi> &amp; me in ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curteous ſort, that thereby we wel perceiued little good hee wiſheth vs, afterwards he recited vnto her word by word, of all that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, &amp; how in the end the king riſing vp in a great rage, told them that the worlde was large enough for them to goe ſeeke ſome other place where they might bee better requited then of him. And for this cauſe Madame ſayde <hi>Amadis,</hi> wee muſt of force doe what hee hath commaunded, otherwiſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7179:216"/>
wee ſhould greatly preiudice our honours, remaining againſt his wil in his ſeruice, ſeeing that he might preſume that wee had no other place to goe vnto, where we might be entertained, therefore I beſeech you not to be offended, if in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him I am conſtrained to leaue you for a ſeaſon. You know what power you haue ouer mee, and that I am as much yours as you can wiſh, more-ouer I know very well that if I ſhould gaine any bad repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, you are ſhe that would bee moſt offended therewith, ſo much am I ſure that you doe loue and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme mee, which maketh mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to entreate you to allow of my departure, and to giue mee leaue, vſing your accuſtomed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and vertue. Alas, anſwered ſhee, my deere loue, what doe you tell me? Madame, if it pleaſe God the King heereafter will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the wrong that he hath done vnto vs, and I ſhall bee as well wel-come vnto him as euer I haue bin. Gentle friend, anſwered the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, you do much amiſſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of my father, for if he hath receiued any good from you, it was for my loue, &amp; by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I gaue vnto you, and not for his ſake, for I alone did bring you hither, and was the cauſe that you remained with him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not hee that muſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence you, but I, vnto whom you belong. It is very true that hee hath alwaies thought otherwiſe, for which hee is the more to bee blamed for anſwering you ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreetly. And although that your departure is the moſt grieuous thing that could happen to me (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a matter of conſtraint) I am content to fortifie my ſelfe, and to prefer reaſon before the delights and pleaſures which I receiue by your preſence. Therefore will I frame my will to your liking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am ſure that in what place ſoeuer you ſhall bee, your heart (which is mine) ſhall remaine with mee, as pledge of the power which you haue giuen me ouer your ſelfe, and yet moreouer, my father in loſing you ſhall know by thoſe few that he ſhall haue left, what he hath loſt by you. Madame, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> the fauour which you ſhew vnto me is ſo great, that I eſteeme it no leſſe then the redemption of mine owne life. For you know that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery vertuous man ought to haue his honour in ſuch eſtimation, that hee ought to preferre it before his owne life. In like ſort Madam, ſeeing that to conſerue it I muſt of force depart from you, doe thus much if it pleaſe you for mee, as (during my abſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) to let me heare very often from you: And to hold mee alwaies in your good fauour, as he who was neuer borne but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obay and ſerue you. And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whoſoeuer had ſeene the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe then, when <hi>Amadis</hi> took this ſorrowfull farwell, he might eaſily haue bin witnes of the paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſhe indured. Neuertheleſſe <hi>Amadis</hi> ſeeing the day conſtrained him to depart (in kiſſing her ſweetly) hee roſe vp, leauing her ſo ful of ſorrow &amp; heauines, that although ſhee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled as well as ſhee could, this her extreame greefe, yet had ſhee not ſo much power ouer her ſelfe, but that ſhee awaked <hi>Mabila</hi> and the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> with her loud ſighes, who thinking her to bee taken with ſome new diſeaſe came haſtily vnto her, and found that <hi>Amadis</hi> was already apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Then they demanded of him, what moued <hi>Oriana</hi> in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame ſort to complaine. <hi>Amadis</hi> tolde them the whole diſcourſe in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7179:216"/>
what ſort hee was conſtrained to forſake the court, and the ſeruice of the king, wherefore my louing friends ſaid he, I pray you to go &amp; comfort my Lady. Which ſaid, he tooke his leaue of them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, leauing al the three Ladies accompanied onely with ſorrow, and extreame paſſion. Now you muſt know that ſo ſoon as <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Galuanes</hi> were come vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> his lodging, they ſent vnto all their friends particularly, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate them to meet there the next morning, the which they accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly performed, then they went altogether to the Church to heare ſeruice, at their returne from whence, they all walking in a great field, <hi>Amadis</hi> began to ſpeake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in this manner: My Lords becauſe that ſome one may wrongfully blame my Lord <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanes, Agraies,</hi> me, &amp; ſome others here preſent, for leauing the king his ſeruice (as wee are determined to do) they and I haue thought good to let you vnderſtand what is the occaſion thereof. I beleeue that there is not any in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that knoweth not whether ſince our arriuall in great <hi>Brittaine</hi> the authority of a Prince bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed or diminiſhed. Wherfore without ſpending the time in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing the ſeruices which wee haue done vnto him, for the which we had great hope to haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (beſides his good will) a great reward, I will declare vnto you particularly, with what ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude he vſed vs yeſterday, &amp; eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as, fortune which is mutable &amp; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, doth often times ouerthrow all things, ſo hath hee changed his conditions, eyther by ſome bad counſaile which he hath receiued, or for ſome ſleight occaſion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are ignorant. But this much I am ſure, that my Lord <hi>Galuanes</hi> did deſire vs to bee a meanes for him vnto his Maieſty not paſt eight or ten daies ſince, that hee would bee pleaſed to permit him to marry with <hi>Madaſima,</hi> and in ſo doing, to ſuffer him likewiſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy her lands, vpon this condition that he ſhould hold them of him, and of his Crowne, by fealty and homage, the which wee promiſed to performe. By meanes wherof, ſo ſoone as I was able to goe, I and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this company did make this requeſt vnto him, but he with-out any regard eyther vnto vs that were ſutors, or vnto him for whom we ſued, who is (as euery on know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) brother vnto the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as valiant and hardy a knight as poſſible may be, &amp; ſuch a one as in the late battell againſt king <hi>Cil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dadan</hi> hath not ſpared his life, but hath done as much as any other that was there, he hath not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed our requeſts, but alſo giuen vs ſuch iniurious words, as were far vnfit and vnworthy ſuch a king. And notwithſtanding at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning wee made ſmall account thereof, vntill hee ſaid vnto vs all (as we ſhewed vnto him ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for our requeſt) that we ſhold goe ſeeke elſe where for ſuch a one as would acknowledge, and better eſteeme of vs then he did, and that the world was wide enough, with-out importuning him any further. Therefore my fellows and friends ſince that being in his ſeruice, wee haue beene euer dutifull vnto him, ſo for my part I am yet very well content in this caſe not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him and to get mee forth of his countrie.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe it ſeemeth vnto mee that this his licence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part doth not onely touch mee, and thoſe vnto whom hee ſpake,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7179:217"/>
but all others who are none of his ſubiects, I thought it good to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you therewith, to the end, that you might bethinke what to doc. Much were theſe Knights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſed at the words of <hi>Amadis,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that if the great ſeruiſes of him and his brethren were ſo badly requited, that very hardly would that little which they had done be recompenſed. Wherefore they determined to forſake the King, and to go ſeeke their fortune elſe-where, eſpecially <hi>Angriotta de Eſtranaux,</hi> who to draw the reſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his opinion and to follow <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> hee began to ſay with a loude voyce. My Lords, it is yet no long time ſince I knew the King, and for that little acquaintance that I haue had with him, I did neuer ſee a Prince more wiſe, vertuous and temperate, then he hath bin in his affaires, wherefore I doubt mee greatly, that this which hee hath done vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> and to theſe Lords preſent, proceedeth nor of his own fancy: but he hath bin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited thereunto by ſome wicked malicious perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who hath perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that ſort. And becauſe that for theſe eighteene daies, I haue ſeen <hi>Gandandel</hi> &amp; <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadan</hi> very often conſulting with him, and that ſo he hath been more priuat with them then any other, I feare me that they are the men that haue bin the chiefe workers of this miſchiefe, for I haue known the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of long time for the moſt malicious perſons in all the world. Therefore I am determined euen this day to demand the combat againſt them, and to maintain that faſly and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly they haue ſet diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the king and <hi>Amadis,</hi> and if they will make excuſe becauſe of their age, they haue each of them a ſonne which of long time haue borne Armes, againſt whom I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone will fight, if they dare bee ſo bolde to maintaine the reaſon of their wicked parents. Ah my Lord <hi>Angriotta,</hi> anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I ſhould bee very ſorry that you ſhould hazard your body in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo vncertaine. By my faith, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Angriotta,</hi> I am very ſure thereof, and I haue perceiued it of long time, ſo that if the king would bee pleaſed to tell but what hee knoweth, hee would affirme them to be ſuch as I ſay. I pray you Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle friend, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> deferre it yet for this time, to the end, that the king may haue no cauſe to bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, for if thoſe whom you ſpeake of (who haue alwaies ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mee a friendly countenance) haue beene ſo malicious as to play falſe play behinde my backe, aſſure you that at length their wickednes ſhall bee diſcouered, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert recompenſed, then ſhall you haue reaſon to accuſe them. Well, anſwered <hi>Augriotta,</hi> although this is againſt my will, yet I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to deferre it, but beleeue mee that heereafter I ſhall both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, and bee reuenged of them well enough.</p>
                  <p>For the reſt, my good friends, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> if it pleaſed the King and Queene to vouchſaſe to ſee mee, I am determined to goe forthwith and take my leaue of them, and ſo to retire vnto the Firme-Iſland, in hope that thoſe which will follow mee, ſhall wholly bee pertakers with mee, in all the good and pleaſure which there I ſhall haue.

Your Maieſty may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to vnderſtand that the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our comming hither was to ſee <hi>Amadis</hi> and his brethren, and to be their friends, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And euen as they were cauſe of the ſeruice that you haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of vs, they alſo ſhall bee the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7179:218"/>
meanes that we will forſake you, and we do take leaue of your grace to keepe them company. When the king perceiued that hee was ſo ſuddenely forſaken of ſuch a great number of good knights, hee was highly diſpleaſd, for very ſpight he would not permit <hi>Amadis</hi> to goe take his leaue of the Queene, who (as much as in her lay) did wholy oppoſe her ſelfe againſt the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Gandandell</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And therefore <hi>Amadis</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the auncient knight <hi>Don Grumedan</hi> to make his excuſe vnto her Maieſty. Afterwards taking his leaue of the king with great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, he retired vnto his lodging with his friends and companions, where they found their dinner rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and as ſoone as the Table was taken vp, euery one went to arme him, and they trouped altogether in a place where <hi>Oriana</hi> might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, and their number was ſo great, as they were thought to be flue hundred knights and more, the moſt part of them being Sons vnto kings, dukes or earles. After-wards in very good order they all paſſed along hard by the Queenes lodging. Then <hi>Mabila</hi> being in one of the windows called <hi>Oriana</hi> who was laid vpon her bed as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy as might be, ſaying vnto her, Madame, I pray you forget your heauineſſe, and come ſee how many knights you haue at your commandement. All the while my coſin was in the ſeruice of the king your father, he was accounted but as a ſimple wandring knight, but no ſooner is he departed from him when hee ſheweth that hee is a Prince and mighty Lord, as you may now behold, and if you haue power ouer him, by greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon haue you power ouer all his troope, of whom hee is the chiefe and principall Leader. <hi>Oriana</hi> was ſo greatly comforted with this ſight, that euer after ſhe was more merry and at better hearts caſe. In this ſort did <hi>Amadis</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers paſſe through the Citty, and there accompanied them king <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>North wales, Grumedan,</hi> a knight of honour belonging to the Queene, <hi>Brandoinas, Queuerant Giontes</hi> Nephew to the King, and <hi>Liſtoran</hi> the good iouſter. All theſe were very ſorry for the departure of ſo many good knights, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for <hi>Amadis,</hi> who prayed them that in any matter wherein his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour might bee blemiſhed, they would ſhew themſelues to be ſuch friends for him, as hee eſteemed them. And although the king (without any occaſion) had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a hate againſt him, yet they ſhould not ceaſe for all that to be his friends, without forſaking the ſeruice of ſo good a prince, and they anſwered him that excepting their ſeruice and loyalty in the which they were by duty bounde vnto the king, they would bee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to pleaſure him at all times and places, when and where he would employ them, for the which hee heartilie thanked them. After-wards hee ſaide vnto them, If you finde the king fit to be ſpoken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, you may aduertiſe him that which <hi>Vrganda</hi> declared to mee in his preſence is now accompliſhed, for ſhee told mee that the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence which I ſhould haue in gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Dominions for another, ſhould be hate, anger, and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from that place where moſt I deſired to remaine.

al this, the king with-out cauſe at all, hath requited mee with hate, but God is iuſt, and will recompence euery one according to his deſerts.</p>
                  <p>By my faith, anſwered <hi>Grumedan,</hi> I will not faile to let the King know as much as you haue ſayde. And curſed be <hi>Vrganda</hi> for propheſing ſo right, which ſaide, they embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced one another and tooke their leaue, but <hi>Guillan</hi> the penſif whoſe eyes were full of teares, ſaid vnto <hi>Amadis.</hi> My Lord, you know my occaſion, and how I cannot of my ſelfe doe any thing, being ſubiect ſo the will of another, for whoſe ſake I ſuffer and endure ſtrange greefes and anguiſhes, which is the cauſe that I cannot follow you, for which I am very ſorry and aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſo great a deſire haue I to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the fauour and honour that I haue receiued of you, being in your company, beſeeching you moſt humbly at this time to holde me excuſed. Now did <hi>Amadis</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in what ſubiection loue did holde him, and hee knew very well by himſelfe what paine hee might ſuffer, by meanes whereof he anſwered him: My Lord <hi>Guillan,</hi> God forbid that by my occaſion you ſhould commit any offence vnto the Lady whom you loue ſo conſtantly, but I rather counſell you to be obedient vnto her, and to ſerue her as hitherto you haue done, and the King likewiſe being ſure that your honour ſaued, you wil be vnto me in all places a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friend and louing companion. Heerewithall he embraced him, &amp; taking his leaue, <hi>Guillan</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes returned vnto the Cittie, and <hi>Amadis</hi> and his followed on their way to the Firme-Iſland, vntill at the laſt they arriued along by a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, vpon the ſide whereof <hi>Amadis</hi> had ſent before to cauſe his Tents and Pauillions to be armed and ſet vp. There they lodged for that night, praiſing God in that they had ſo happily been warned of the Kings ingratitude, with whom if they had remained any longer, ſpace, they had but loſt their time. But <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſo heauie for his baniſhment from <hi>Oriana</hi> (igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant when he ſhould ſee her again) that he knew not in what ſort to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his malancholie, and thus they paſſed away the night vntill the next morning, that they had rode forward on their way. In the meane time King <hi>Liſuart</hi> was in his Pallace, who after the departure of ſo great a number of Knights, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that he now was but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied.

                     </hi> were aduertiſed what <hi>Angriotta</hi> had ſaid of them, whereat they were maruailouſly abaſhed, fearing leaſt the King and the reſt ſhould diſlike of the bad counſell, which they had giued vnto him, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſince there was no remedy: they determined to paſſe it ouer, and to worke ſuch meanes that ne-uer any of thoſe Knights who were departed ſhould enter into the King his fauour againe. And the better to bring it to paſſe, they both came vnto him, ſaying. Your Maieſtie ought greatly to praiſe God, that you are ſo honeſtly rid of thoſe men who might haue wrought you much miſchiefe, for your highneſſe knoweth there is nothing more dangerous then a ſecret enemy.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore you haue now no other thing to trouble you, neither
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7179:219"/>
neede you take any care for your affaires, becauſe that wee two will take order, and warily prouide for any perill that may happen to this Realme. When the king heard them ſpeake ſo audaciouſly, hee looked vpon them with a ſowre countenance, and anſwered them: I do much meruaile how you dare bee ſo preſumptuous to perſwade me that I ſhould leaue vnto you the gouernment, not onely of my houſe, but alſo of my whole realm, knowing that you are nothing fit, nor ſufficient for ſuch a charge. Doe you imagine that the Princes and Lords of this monarchie will obay you, knowing the place from whence you are deſcended? And if you thinke to play the good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, deſiring to enrich mee by ſparing of my treaſure, vpon whom doe you thinke that I may better imploy it, then vpon ſuch Gentle-men and knights as are in my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice? Seeing that the Prince can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be named a king, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee hath many at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.

                  <p>Saying ſo he left them, much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed at theſe wordes, and hee mounted on horſebacke to goe chaſe a hart which his hunters told him was incloſed within his toiles.

did caſt fire and ſmoake as well from her eyes and eares, as from her throate, who came and entred into this Tower, ſhewing a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſo furious, that the ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the company trembled with great feare, after him there ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly followed two Lions, who in like ſort came forth of this ditch, they came leaping in and aſſailed the Serpent, herewithall there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a battaile betweene them, the crueleſt that may poſſibly be ſeene betweene brute beaſts, and it laſted halfe an houre and more, and ſo long continued it, that the two Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons became ſo wearie as they fell downe in the place as if they had been dead, &amp; the Serpent likewiſe ſo out of breath, that hee remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a great while lying vpon the ground. In the end hauing reſted a little, hee roſe vp and ſwallowed one of the Lions down his throat, and carried him into the ditch, and preſently after he returned, &amp; did the like vnto the ſecond, and were no more ſeene all the day after. Thoſe of the Iſle (accuſtomed to ſuch wonders) beholding our feare laughed at vs, aſſuring vs that all the day long wee ſhould ſee no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nouelty. Whereupon we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to laugh at our folly, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching one another, for the affright that had happened vnto vs, &amp; thus we paſſed all the afternoone vntill it was bed time, that my Lady and wee her women were brought into a chamber richly hanged, in the which wee were all layed. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight, wee did heare our chamber doore open with ſo great noyſe, that wee awaked with great feare thereof, and therewithall we ſaw entring in a Hart, one ſide of whom was as white as ſnow, and the other ſide more blacke then a rauen: hauing vpon his head thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hornes, vpon euery one of which there was a burning candle, which gaue ſo great a light, that one might haue ſeene as plaine within the chamber, as if it had beene broad day. The Hart entred in running with great force, for hee was purſued by a cry of ſwift hounds, that laboured to ouertake him, and incourage them thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, there was heard an Iuory home ſounding after the beaſt, who in the ende was ſo hardly purſued, that after hee had long turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the chamber, hee leaped vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our beds euen thorough the midſt of vs. The feare whereof made vs to cry, and ſuddenly to riſe vp, all naked as wee were, ſome of vs ran vnder the beds, others vnder the benches, but the more we thought to ſaue our ſelues, the more were we purſued by the Hart and hounds that followed him, till at the laſt hee ran towarde the windowes, afterwardes being a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better aſſured, we took vp our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell which was fallen downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, and wee began to chat of the feare which we had. And as wee were in theſe tearmes, there came a Damoſell, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with two other women, who asked vs what mooued vs to riſe ſo earely.

This Damoſell ſmyled and ſayde vnto her, that ſhee and wee might ſleep in ſafety, for we ſhould haue no more ſtirre all the night after. Whereupon wee layd vs downe in our bed, and there wee remained vntill it was indifferent late the next morning, when my Lady cauſed vs to riſe vp, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wee had heard ſeruice, as ſhee walked in a great meddow watered with many pleaſant brookes going
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7179:220"/>
through a pleaſant and delectable wood where we found at the end thereof many pleaſant orchards, and a houſe very round, ſet vpon twelue pillars of Marble, ſo artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially wrought, that in ſtead of ſtone and morter, the walls there-of were of fine Chriſtall, through the which they that were within, might eaſily ſee thoſe without, and there was neuer a doore thereof which was not of Gold or Siluer. And (that which was moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) there was about it many I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of copper, made in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Giants, each of them hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in their hands a bended bow, and an arrow therein, the head whereof was of ſuch a burning brightnes, that it ſeemed fire came out therof. And it was told vs that no ſooner was any ſo hardy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein, but preſently he ſhold bee ſlaine by the arrows which by them are ſhot, whereupon my Lady was deſirous to make proofe thereof, by a Horſe and two Apes, who being put into the Chamber were preſently conſumed by the fire, proceeding from theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows that compaſſed them about. And there was grauen vpon the portall theſe words. Let no man nor woman be ſo hardy as to ſet foote within this Palace, except it be he or ſhee that loueth as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly as <hi>Grimaneſa</hi> and <hi>Apolidon,</hi> that made this enchantment. And they muſt of neceſſity enter in both together for the firſt time, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe let them be aſſured to die moſt cruelly, and this enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall laſt, and all the reſt of this Iſland, vntill that the knight &amp; Lady (who do ſurpaſſe in loyalty thoſe that made the defences of the forbidden Chamber) bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in, and there haue taken their pleaſure. Hereupon my Lady cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Iſania</hi> to be called, and tolde him ſhe was glad that ſhe had ſeen theſe wonders, but ſhee would yet ſee the Arch of loyall Louers, and the chamber ſo renowned, and in the meane ſeaſon, ſhe deſired him to tell her what was meant by the Hart, Serpent, Dogs and Lions, Madame anſwered <hi>Iſania,</hi> I know no other thing thereof, but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day at thoſe houres and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that you did ſee them, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats of the beaſts are made, and the Hart doth alwaies leape downe from the window, and the Dogs after, who purſue him into a Lake not far from hence, where they are hidden and ſeene no more vntill the next day and houre that the chaſe beginneth againe, as you haue ſeene it this night paſt. But thus much you ſhall know, that if you were one whole yeere in this Iſland, yet ſhould you not haue time enough to ſee all the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull things which there are. For this cauſe my Lady and her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany mounted on horſeback, and we came vnto the Palace of <hi>Apoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to ſee the arch of loyall Louers and the forbidden Chamber. Whereunto my Lady was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner come but ſhe alighted, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched vnto the Image of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (as ſhe that had neuer falſified her loue) and paſſing vnder, there was heard the moſt ſweete, and melodious tune in all the world, and the Queene paſſed through e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto the place where the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitures of <hi>Apolidon</hi> and <hi>Grimane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> were, which ſeemed vnto her as though they had been aliue. And from thence ſhee came vnto the piller of Iaſper, where ſhe ſaw writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten theſe wordes. <hi>Briolania</hi> the daughter to <hi>Tagadan</hi> king of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bradiſa,</hi> is the third Damoſell that did euer enter into this place. But
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7179:221"/>
as my Ladylooked rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about her in all places ſhe was afraid, ſeeing that ſhe was alone: therefore with-out long tarrying there, ſhe retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto vs that ſtayed for her, and for this time ſhee would make no farther proofe vntill the 5. day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, that ſhee did put on the richeſt, and coſtlieſt apparrell that in al her life ſhe had euer worne, &amp; letting her hayre hang downe, which were the fayreſt that euer nature framed, ſhee had vpon her head, no more then a border of Gold garniſhed with many preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones, the which did become her ſo well, and made her ſeeme ſo ſaire, that as well her owne follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as ſtrangers did plainly ſay, that without doubt ſhee would finiſh the aduentures of the Iſle: her eup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on recommending her ſelfe vnto God, ſhe entred vpon the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den path, and paſſing the braſſe pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, ſhe came cloſe vnto the other of Marble, where ſhe red the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that were grauen thereupon, afterwards ſhe marched on far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that euery one did then iudge that ſhee would enter into the chamber without any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. When <hi>Oriana</hi> heard that <hi>Brio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lania</hi> had paſſed ſo far, ſhe began to bluſh and change her naturall colour, in ſuch ſort that one might eaſily haue knowne the great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her minde, fearing that <hi>Briolania</hi> had paſſed no farther, thereby ending the aduenture of the forbidden chamber. But the Damoſell proceeding forward in her diſcourſe, ſaid, you muſt know that ſo ſoone as the Queene came within three paces of the chamber ſhe was taken ſo rudely by her fair and golden haires, that without all reſpect of pitty, ſhee was throwne out with ſuch force beyond the pillar that ſhe remained in aſwond a long time, as many others had done before her: whereupon wee ſuddainly tooke her vp, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her vnto her chamber, where ſhortly after ſhe recouered, and ſhe determined the next morning to depart from thence. The which ſhe did, taking the way to <hi>Sobradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa.</hi> Neuertheleſſe ſhee had before commanded me to come vnto this Court, to aduertiſe you of that which I haue declared. Truly Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> the Queene your Miſtreſſe hath done much for me. Madam, ſaid the Damoſell, ſhe hath expreſſely charged me to returne vnto her incontinently, wherefore it may pleaſe you to giue me leaue to depart. Faire Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mofel ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> you ſhall ſee the Queene, &amp; then to morrow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you ſhall depart. Well Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame ſaid ſhe, I am content to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey you. Now about this time <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> and his fellowes arriued at the Firme-Iſland, where they were moſt royally entertayned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by all thoſe of the country, who were exceeding glad for the recouerie of their new lord, whom they had thought to hauebeen loſt. And after that theſe knights (who had followed <hi>Amadis)</hi> had well viewed the Iſle, and ſeene the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, and the inuincible ſcituation thereof, they iudged that king <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> nor any other prince could be of power ſufficient as once to dare come and aſſaile them. For beſides the force of the country, it was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with many citties &amp; towns, and beautified with foure Caſtles, the moſt ſumptuous and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent that were in all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. In one of them might a man beholde the ſport of the Hart cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Dogs, in the other, the Combat betweene the Lions and the Serpent, then in the third, the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7179:221"/>
tower which made the turning pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillion, for foure times a day it turned ſo faſt, that thoſe which were therein did thinke that it would ſinke: Laſtly in the ſourth was the paſtime of the baited Bul: who comming foorth of an olde ditch, paſſed ouer the people that ſtood in his way, and did come running with his hornes againſt a gate of iron with ſuch force, that hee ouerthrew it, and opened a Tower, from whence there came forth an old Ape, ſo wrinkled that his skinne hanged downe on all parts of him, the which held a whip, wherwith he nimbly chaſed the Bull euen vnto the ditch, from whence he came forth. In all theſe foure Caſtles did <hi>Amadis</hi> and his fellowes oftentimes take their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime, for the ſtrange ſights that there they ſawe. And in this ſort did theſe knights paſſe the time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſtaying vntill fortune did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them ſome new occaſion to arme themſelues, the which ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after ſhe did: for <hi>Balais Carſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> (whom <hi>Amadis</hi> had heretofore deliuered from the priſons of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus)</hi> came vnto him, from the Court of Kings <hi>Liſuart,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee had declared vnto them many nouels, hee tolde them how king <hi>Liſuart</hi> was preparing an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to paſſe into the Iſle of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaza,</hi> for <hi>Grumedaca</hi> had made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere vnto the Earle <hi>Latin</hi> (who was ſent with the olde Gyant and his ſonnes, to take poſſeſſion of the countrey) that ſhee would ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner conſent vnto the death of her ſelfe and all the world, before ſhe would yeeld vp the Burning lake, and the three ſtrong Caſtles which ſhee held, and that they ſhould doe with her Daughter <hi>Madaſima</hi> and the other Damoſels what they would. I pray you ſaide <hi>Agraics</hi> tell vs what countenance the King ſhewed, hearing ſuch an anſwere. By my faith anſwered <hi>Balais,</hi> he is determined to put all to fire and ſword if hee be reſiſted, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a moneth after, to cauſe the heads of the pledges which hee holdeth to be ſmitten off. Truely ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> hee may doe what he pleaſe, but if hee vſed more curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, it were perchance better for him.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Galuanes</hi> whom (I haue ſaid) <hi>Cupid</hi> had depriued of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to make him a louer, and ſeruant vnto this <hi>Madaſima,</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the outrage that was likely to be offered vnto her, his courage increaſed in ſuch ſort, that in great choller hee ſayd. My Lords, here is not any of you knoweth not that my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> and wee are all departed from the Court of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> eſpecially for the bad vſage that hee hath offered vnto <hi>Madaſima,</hi> vnto whom I bear ſuch loue, as a husband ſhould vnto his wife, and therefore I beſeech you very earneſtly to aid and aſſiſt me, for I haue promiſed to ſtick to her and to helpe her, though I ſhould die in the quarrell. Then <hi>Floreſtan</hi> (vnderſtanding the aid which <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanes</hi> demanded) had not the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to let any other anſwer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, but roſe vp ſaying. My Lord <hi>Galuanes</hi> if it were poſſible to make a peace for her with the king that were the beſt courſe: but I aſſure you, if wee muſt make it with our ſwords, I am alwaies rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to aſſiſt you, My Lord anſwered <hi>Bria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> of <hi>Moniaſta,</hi> we do al very wel know, that you are both valiant &amp; hardy knights, neuertheleſſe this enterpriſe which you determine, toucheth you no more in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, then it doth all vs in generall, for we are departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Kings
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7179:222"/>
ſeruice all vpon one occaſion: and therefore it is reaſon that all of vs ſhould ſuccor him that hath moſt need of helpe. And although wee had no deſire to aide <hi>Don Galuanes</hi> heere preſent, yet are wee bound to fauour Ladies in all that we can, and amongſt other <hi>Madaſima</hi> and hers, aſſuring you that through my fault they ſhall neither haue hurt nor diſpleaſure. By my faith ſaid <hi>Quedragant,</hi> you ſpeak vertuouſly, and according to good reaſon, for doing otherwiſe we ſhould be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the name of knights, and although I were my ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone yet would I ſeeke aide to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute that which you haue deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: knowing that the poore <hi>Madaſima</hi> (forſaken of euery one) hath freely yeelded her ſelfe into the King his priſons, not by her owne will, but by the dutifull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which ſhee deſired to ſhew vnto her mother: For which cauſe if the king pretend any right vnto the lands of the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza,</hi> I ſay hee doth wrong. My Lords anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> thoſe things which are debated by ſound deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, doe aſſuredly come vnto good end, &amp; you need not doubt that enterpriſing this which you determine, you ſhall performe it vnto your honour, yea although it were more dangerous and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult then it is, neuertheleſſe (if it pleaſe you) I will declare what I thinke thereof. You doe all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude (ſo farre as I ſee) to ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty the twelue Damoſels now priſoners with king <hi>Liſuart.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am of the opinion that twelue of you without any more ſhould vndertake this enterpriſe, ſo euery one of you ſhall haue one of them, and the twelue gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen ſhall bee particularly bound vnto twelue knights, and the reſt of this company ſhall ſpare themſelues, and tarry heere to preuent ſuch inconueniencies as may happen.</p>
                  <p>Mee thinkes that <hi>Galuanes</hi> vnto whom this matter doth chiefly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine, deſerueth well to be the firſt man that ſhall be named, next <hi>Agraies</hi> his nephewe, <hi>Floreſtan</hi> my brother, <hi>Palomir, Dragonis, Brian, Nicoran, Orlandid, Garnat, Imoſil</hi> brother to the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goine, Madanſil,</hi> and <hi>Eaderin.</hi> You twelue are ſuch valiant knights as you may anſwere twelue others whatſoeuer they bee, and King <hi>Liſuart</hi> cannot deny the combate although it ſhould bee againſt the chiefeſt of his Realme, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the houſes from which you are deſcended. This counſaile was ſo well allowed of all, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout mid-night following, the twelue knights mounted on horſe-backe, taking their way vnto the Citie of <hi>Thaſsillana,</hi> in the which the King ſoiourned.</p>

                     <p>How <hi>Oriana</hi> remayned in great perplexity, not onely for the departure of <hi>Amadis,</hi> but alſo becauſe ſhe felt her ſelfe great with childe: and of that which happened to the twelue Knights that were departed from the Firme-Iſland, to deliuer <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her Damoſels.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Little before it hath beene tolde vnto you, how <hi>Amadis</hi> remained eight daies in <hi>Mirefleur</hi> with <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> contenting their affections and deſires to the full: in ſuch ſort as two moneths after, or there about, the Princeſſe doubted that ſhe was with childe, neuertheleſſe for the little experince that ſhee had in ſuch matters, ſhe made no account thereof, vntill after the departure of <hi>Amadis,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coulour in her face beganne to fade and decay, and her ſtomack waxed very bad, and weake, ſo that this doubt was turned into a certaintie, wherefore ſhee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to acquaint <hi>Mabila</hi> and the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> therewith, as vnto thoſe whom ſhe eſteemed the true treaſurers of her ſecrets. For which cauſe beeing one day withdrawne into her cloſet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her eyes full of teares, and her heart oppreſſed with griefe, ſhee ſayd vnto them: Alas my deare friends and louing counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, I do now well perceiue that Fortune wil wholy work my ruine and ouerthrowe: You haue ſeene what in conuenience hath happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of late vnto the perſon whom I doe moſt loue in the world, and now (that which is worſt of all) the thing which I haue moſt fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and doubted, is lighted vpon mee: For certainely I am with child, and I know not what I ſhall doe, that I be not diſcouered and vndone. Much abaſhed were theſe two Damoſels at this: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe (as thoſe which were wiſe &amp; well aduiſed) they diſſembled that which they thought thereof. And <hi>Mabila</hi> anſwered <hi>Oriana:</hi> Take no care Madame, God ſhall prouide well enough for you, (if it pleaſe him) but by my faith, (ſaid ſhee in ſmiling) I alwaies doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that vnto ſuch a Saint ſuch an offering would be brought. <hi>Oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> ſmiled to ſee with what a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie grace <hi>Mabila</hi> deliuered this pleaſant ſpeech, &amp; anſwered her: For the honour of God doe you both aduiſe to giue mee ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and then you ſhall ſee if I cannot requite your frumps. As for mee I thinke it beſt, that wee find the meanes to retyre vnto <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reflure,</hi> or elſewhere fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Court, ſtaying the time, vntill it ſhall pleaſe God to regard me in pitty: for I feele my belly to riſe, and I ſee my face already waxen leane. Madame ſayde the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> it is an eaſie matter to preuent an inconuenience, when it is foreſeene before it happen: I will tell you anſwered the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe) whereupon I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought mee: It is neceſſarie that you (Damoſell) doe hazard your life for the ſauing of my honour. You ſee that I doe put more truſt in you, then in any other perſon that liueth. Madame ſayde ſhee, you knowe (or at the leaſt you ſhould know mee ſo well) that I haue neither life nor honour
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7179:223"/>
which I holde ſo deare, that I would not aduenture to doe you ſeruice. I beleeue it anſwered <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> and alſo you may bee aſſured that if God doe lend mee life and health, I will acknowledge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite it to the full: wherefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to morrow morning, and get you to <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> finde the meanes to ſpeake with the Abbeſſe, &amp; tell her that you are with childe, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her earneſtly to keepe your counſaile as ſecret as ſhee would doe her owne, and that ſhe would doe you that good as to finde out ſome woman, to nurſe the fruite that God ſhall ſend you, the which you ſhall cauſe to bee layd within the entry of her Church porch, as a thing found by chance. I am ſure that ſhee loueth you as much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny woman liuing, and ſhee will willingly doe this good turne for you: By this meanes ſhall my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be ſaued, and yours little or nothing the worſe. Repoſe your ſelfe vpon me ſayde the Damoſell, I will play this part well enough, and therefore bee you merry: In the meane ſeaſon do you purchaſe leaue for your departure, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me. Theſe and ſuch like were the conſultations of theſe three Damoſels, whom wee will for the preſent leaue, to returne vnto king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> who after that the Earle <hi>Latin</hi> was returned backe againe, and that he had declared vnto him how <hi>Grumadaca</hi> the old Gyanteſſe, was not determined to yeelde the Caſtle of the burning Lake, nor the three ſtrong places whereof we haue ſpoken: he (by the counſaile of <hi>Broquadan</hi> and <hi>Gandandel)</hi> ſent for <hi>Madaſima</hi> to come vnto him, vnto whom he ſaid: Damoſel, you knowe how you and your women are entred into my priſons vpon this condition, that if your mother did nor yeeld into my hands the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza,</hi> with the burning Lake, &amp; the other places therunto belonging, your heads ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me for it. And becauſe I haue beene of late certified by thoſe which I ſent thither, of the refuſall which ſhe hath made, I will make you an example of it, that euery one thereby may ſee what a matter of importance it is, not to keepe promiſe with a King: for you ſhall all die. When the poore Lady heard this concluſion ſo rigorous, the faire vermilion colour of her face was ſodainely changed into a pale and deadly hew, and falling at the king his feete ſhee anſwered him, If it like your Maieſty, the death which you threaten vnto me, doth ſo much trouble my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that I haue no meanes nor power to make you an anſwere. But if there be any in this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that taketh pittie vpon twelue poore diſtreſſed Damoſels, I doe moſt humbly beſeech him to take our quarrell in hand: for if I haue entred into your priſon, I did it by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of my mother, and they by my perſwaſions did the like. And although that by reaſon euery Gentleman bearing armes, is bound to maintaine the right of afflicted women, if (by misfortune) wee cannot finde any that taketh compaſſion of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, yet it may pleaſe your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty (mittigating the rigour of your lawes) to extend your mercy, and to heare vs in our iuſtifications, as reaſon and equity willeth. When <hi>Gandandel</hi> heard <hi>Madaſima</hi> ſpeake ſo boldly, hee ſuddenly anſwered, ſaying vnto the King, if it pleaſe your Maieſty, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that theſe women ſhould bee ſuffered thus to pleade, for if you cauſe them not to die, euery
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7179:223"/>
one will doe as they doe, neuer performing any thing that they do promiſe vnto you. They are come hither as pledges, nothing igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the conditions: wherefore then ſhall there bee any wrong done vnto them, to cut off their heads, for not yeelding that which they haue promiſed? My Lord <hi>Gandandell,</hi> anſwered the good knight <hi>Grumedan,</hi> if it pleaſe the King, his Maieſty ſhall not doe as you counſaile him: for mercy is more commendable in a King then cruelty, which he may vſe when it pleaſeth him. You know that theſe women, more by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a mother, and the obedience of a childe, then by any their owne wils, haue beene conſtrained to yeelde themſelues priſoners, as they are, and euen as God loueth thoſe that are humble and dutiful, ſo alſo the King who is his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ought not to deſpiſe them. Moreouer I haue beene aduertiſed that certaine knights are already departed from the Firme-Iſland, to maintaine their quarrell againſt you, and the right which they haue: and therefore my Lord <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandel,</hi> if you or your ſonnes dare maintaine this counſell which you doe giue vnto the King for good, it may bee you may finde, that you or they which ſhall haue to doe with them, ſhall not be all at their beſt eaſe. <hi>Gandandel</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Grumedan</hi> to ſpeake ſo vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, could willingly haue wiſhed the words vnſpoken, which he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſo lightly: but now it was too late to remedy that which was paſt helpe, wherefore to ſaue his honour, he anſwered. <hi>Dan Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> you ſeeke to purchaſe me diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and yet haue I not any way deſerued it of you. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſonnes there is not any in this company, who knoweth them not for valiant and bolde knights, and ſuch as will maintaine before all and againſt all men, that this which I haue ſayde vnto the King, is according to right and equity. Wee ſhall ſhortly ſee what they will doe ſayd <hi>Grumedan:</hi> but vpon mine honour, I ſpeake not this in that I wiſh you any hurt, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it ſeemeth vnto me that you counſaile the King amiſſe. Now did the King certainly know that againſt all right, and without any cauſe at all, hee had baniſhed <hi>Amadis,</hi> notwithſtanding his anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vertue could not baniſh this new paſſion, but hearing <hi>Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> ſpeake ſo wiſely, hee willingly gaue eare vnto him: and after-ward demanded of him who were the knights that came for <hi>Madaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. Grumedan</hi> named them all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him one after another. Truely ſayd the King, for ſo ſmall a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they are men of worth, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant knights. <hi>Gandandel</hi> did now very well perceiue, that his affaires were like to proſper worſe and worſe: knowing his two ſonnes to be no ſuch men as to match or compare with <hi>Don Floreſtan, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies, Brian,</hi> or <hi>Garnet</hi> of the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full valley. Wherefore ſo ſoone as the King had ſent the Damoſels backe againe to priſon, he went to ſeeke out <hi>Brocadan,</hi> vnto whom he wholy recited all that which <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan</hi> had ſayde vnto the king in his preſence, at which hee was no leſſe amaſed then hee, whereupon they both retyred into a chamber, that they might more priuately conferre together. And as they were in this conſultation, &amp; that <hi>Brocadan,</hi> reprooued <hi>Gandandel,</hi> curſing the houre that euer he was aduiſed by him, to bring <hi>Amadis</hi> into theſe tearmes: a yong knight
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7179:224"/>
named <hi>Sarquiles,</hi> Coſen vnto <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griotta de Eſtranaux</hi> (being in loue with one of the Neeces of <hi>Broqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan)</hi> was by chance hidden behind the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tapeſtrie of the ſame cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſtaying for ſome ſigne or watch word, which was to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto him by his louing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, hee I ſay heard all their counſaile, whereat hee was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull abaſhed. For which cauſe incontinently after the traytours were departed, hee came foorth from his place, where hee had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all that day beene hidden: and the next morning hee armed him, and as if he had beene come ſome farre iourney, he entred into the Pallace where the king was, vnto whom he came and ſayd: If it may pleaſe your Maieſty, I am none of your ſubiect nor liege man, but in requitall of the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp and education that I haue had in your Court, I am bound to preſerue and defend the honour of your Maieſty. Wherefore your highneſſe may be pleaſed, to bee aduertiſed that within theſe three dayes, I was in ſuch a place, where I heard that <hi>Broquadan</hi> and <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandel</hi> did not only then conſpire (but already had committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and your grace) the greateſt treaſon that might be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined. It is ſure that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to counſell &amp; perſwade you to put <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen to death, and for the reſt I hope if it like your Maieſty, before ten dayes be paſt, that their wickednes ſhalbe wholy laid open &amp; proued vnto you. And becauſe that in maintayning ſuch traitors, you haue of late baniſhed my Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> and many other good knights from your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, I am not determined to ſtay any longer with you, and therefore I take my leaue of your grace, to goe ſeeke out my Vncle <hi>Angriotta,</hi> whom (if God pleaſe) you ſhall ſee in theſe parts, and I with him, determined to auouch by force of armes againſt theſe two traytors, their vniuſt conſpiracies. God be with you (anſwered the king) ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you haue ſo great haſte. Herewithall <hi>Sarquiles</hi> roſe vp, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the king alone very penſiue for the wordes which hee had ſaid vnto him, and ſome few dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he arriued in the Firme-Iſland, as <hi>Amadis, Angriotta, Bruneo,</hi> and others were walking by the Sea ſide, cauſing certaine ſhips to be prepared and rigged, to paſſe into <hi>Gaule:</hi> where king <hi>Perion</hi> had ſent vnto <hi>Amadis</hi> that he ſhould come for certaine affaires which were lately happened vnto him. When <hi>Angriotta</hi> beheld his Nephew <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiles,</hi> he wondred thereat, inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him why hee had left king <hi>Liſuart.</hi> My Lord, anſwered <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiles,</hi> it is for a matter whereat you &amp; all this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie wil greatly admire. Hereupon hee recived vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the whole diſcourſe of the practiſes and counſailes that <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quadan</hi> and <hi>Gandandel</hi> had held vpon the accuſation of <hi>Amadis</hi> &amp; his companions. Well anſwered <hi>Angriotta,</hi> I did alwaies thinke ſo of them. And you my Lord, ſaid hee vnto <hi>Amadis,</hi> doe now finde that to be true which I haue here-tofore told you: But ſeeing it is ſo, I proteſt they ſhall repent their treacherie: for I will depart hence tomorrowe morning to goe and fight with them, and make them acknowledge their villany. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle friend anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> the matter being ſo certaine as it is, you haue no reaſon to deferre the execution of your enterpriſe: and if you had any ſooner performed
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7179:224"/>
that which you now determine, it had beene (perchance) with leſſe aſſurance then you now haue. And after many other diſcourſes they went vnto their lodging, vntill the next morning that <hi>Angriotta</hi> took his leaue of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with his Nephew <hi>Sarquiles,</hi> tooke the right way towards great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> where within few dayes after he arriued. Now you muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that euer ſince the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Amadis,</hi> king <hi>Liſuart</hi> was ſo melancholly as no man could be more, and hee ſpent all the day long in ſtudying with himſelfe: whereof one time aboue all the reſt, <hi>Broquadan</hi> and <hi>Gandandel</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him alone very penſiue, came vnto him and ſayd. May it pleaſe your Maieſty, it ſeemeth vnto vs, that the ouer great care which you take in theſe your affaires, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you of your wonted manner of life, and you take matters more to heart then you neede. It may wel be anſwered the king, but what meane you to tell me ſo? Is it (if it like your Maieſty) ſayd they, for doubt of thoſe that come from the Firme-Iſland, in the defence of <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her Damoſels? by the faith wee owe vnto God, if it pleaſe your grace to credit our counſell, you and your eſtate ſhall be henceforth in greater ſecurity then euer yet it hath beene. And to bring that to paſſe, commaund the heades of thoſe pledges which you haue, this day to bee ſmitten off: Then afterwardes ſend vnto <hi>Galuanes</hi> and the reſt of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie (your enemies) that vpon their liues they be not once ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as to enter into your countries, and if by chance they be already arriued, command them foorth-with to depart, or otherwiſe you will cauſe them to bee cut in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. When the King heard this wicked ſpeech, and vngodly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of theirs, hee remembred that which <hi>Sarquiles</hi> had tolde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, &amp; therwithall he knew that without doubt theſe two traytors did with wrong procure the death of theſe Damoſels: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding becauſe he would not at that time amaſe them, hee onely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered this. You counſaile mee to things farre vnfitting my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: the one that I ſhould with-out proceſſe or order of Iuſtice, put <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her Damoſels to death: and the other, that I ſhould forbid fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my Court thoſe knights that are minded to come thither. But if I ſhould doe this which you ſay, I might bee grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly reproued for it before God, who hath by his great bounty and mercy inſtituted mee King, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Iuſtice vnto euery one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: therefore the counſell which you doe giue vnto mee, is wicked and vnworthy to be receiued. Let it ſuffice you therefore that I haue already liſtned vnto you in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation which you haue contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againſt <hi>Amadis,</hi> whereof I doe greatly repent mee: for I ne-uer receiued of him, nor any of his, but all honor, pleaſure, &amp; ſeruice, wherefore I charge you vpon your liues, that you mooue me no more thereof.</p>
                  <p>Saying ſo he roſe vp, ſhewing by his countenance that hee was very angry, whereat <hi>Gandandel</hi> and <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quadan</hi> were greatly abaſhed, and they were conſtrained to departe vnto their lodging, to determine what was beſt for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be done, ſeeing that already fortune had maruailouſly croſſed them, &amp; they came not in the King his preſence all that day after vntill the next morning, when they attended
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7179:225"/>
vpon him as hee rode into the fields. The King beeing halfe a league from the Cittie, he behelde comming toward him the knights of the Firme-Iſland, for the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her Damoſels, being come ſomewhat neere they all did their duties to his Maieſtie. Then <hi>Galuanes</hi> who marched for-moſt, took vpon him to ſpeake for all his fellowes, ſaying vnto the King. If it like your Maieſtie, wee (being all of vs well aſſured of your accuſtomed vertue) are come to demand iuſtice of your grace for <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her Damoſels, and to defend their right if by force of armes it is defenſible. My friends, anſwered hee, ſeeing that you haue already ſet vp your Tents in this place, if you thinke good you may heere abide for this day, and to morrow you may come vnto mee, to aduiſe vpon that which ſhall be reaſonable to bee done. If it pleaſe your highneſſe, ſaid <hi>Brian</hi> of Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſta, wee all are aſſured that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your, ancient royall beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, iuſtice ſhall not bee denied vnto vs, and if wee finde it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it is rather by the counſaile of ſome wicked traitors that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you, then any of your owne motion. <hi>Brian, Brian,</hi> ſaide the King, I am well aſſured that if you had beleeued your father, you would neither haue departed from my ſeruice (as you haue done) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would you in this ſort haue helde argument againſt mee. The argument which I do hold againſt your Maieſtie, ſaid <hi>Brian,</hi> is not for any il will, or that I would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any dutifull ſeruice for your grace, for I know well that in time you will acknowledge that which I ſay true. And where your Maieſtie doth tell me that if I had beleeued my father, I would not haue forſaken you, ſauing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of your Maieſtie I did ne-uer forſake you, for I neuer did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto you: but I onely came into your houſe to ſeeke my coſin <hi>Amadis,</hi> who ſo long as hee was yours, ſo long had I a deſire to ſerue you, and neuer did I whilſt I there remained offend you, Well, well, anſwered the King, wee will debate of this another time more at large. Which ſaid, he bad them good night, and departed: for it was already ſomewhat late. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore you haue heard how the King had the day before, after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, taken vp <hi>Gandandel</hi> and <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quadan,</hi> who beeing very heauie, did conſult a great while how they might with honour finiſh theyt wicked enterpriſe, for the next morning the twelue Knights of the Firme-Iſland met the King at Church, who after ſeruice was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, called <hi>Broquadan</hi> and <hi>Gandan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> vnto whom he ſaid. You haue of long time counſailed me to put <hi>Madaſima</hi> and her Damoſels to death, beeing our priſoners, and that in their behalfe I ſhould heare no iuſtification whatſoeuer. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt now make anſwere vnto that which theſe 12 Knights will maintaine. Then <hi>Imoſell</hi> of Burgoine ſtepped forth, ſaying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King. If it like your Maieſtie, I and my fellowes are come into your Court to beſeech you moſt humble, that you would extend your iuſtice and mercy to <hi>Madaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> and her Damoſels. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Gandandel</hi> ſtepped forth and anſwered: My Lord <hi>Imoſel,</hi> you requeſt that iuſtice ſhould bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to <hi>Madaſima,</hi> and ſo farre as I perceiue, you twelue wil main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that they ought to be heard in their iuſtifications, but by the faith that I owe vnto the King, if he
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7179:225"/>
conſent thereunto he doth amiſſe, conſidering vnder what condition they are entred into his priſon.</p>
                  <p>Beleeue me <hi>Gandandel</hi> ſaid <hi>Imo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> had you held your peace you had done but your duty, for the king hath not yet commanded you to ſpeak, &amp; alſo becauſe you know that by the cuſtome of great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> no woman ought to ſuffer death, except it bee in two caſes, the one for <hi>Leze maieſtie,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for treaſon. But there is not any in this company, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how theſe poore women were brought into the king his hands, more by compulſion then their owne conſent. Therefore we beſeech your Maieſty and you my Lords all to conſider of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for reaſon and pittie are moſt fit to be vſed therein. You are to blame anſwered <hi>Gandandel,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt a thing ſo vnreaſonable, and ſeeing it hath pleaſed the king to heare vs both, let him order the matter as to his maieſty ſhall ſeem moſt conuenient. Then the king cauſed euery one to depart, &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſome of the moſt principall of the realme vnto him, and amongſt others his Vncle the Earle <hi>Arga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> an auncient &amp; moſt vertuous Prince, vnto whom he ſaid, Good Vncle, I pray you and all the reſt alſo, to counſell me vpon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie. But there was not any that would ſpeake their opinion, before they had heard the king. Seeing it is ſo ſayde the king, you ſhal preſently know mine opinion, It ſeemeth vnto me <hi>Imoſel</hi> of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gondie</hi> hath both reaſonable and wiſely ſpoken, and that the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels ought to be heard, what they they can ſay in their own defence. Truely if it like your Maieſty, ſayd the old Earle, you ſpeak like a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous king, and it is not poſſible to giue a righter iudgement, of which opinion they were all. Wherefore he commanded <hi>Gandandel &amp; Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quadan</hi> to bee ſent for, and in the preſence of the knights of the Firme-Iſland, hee gaue the ſame ſentence, for the which they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thanked his maieſty, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that <hi>Madaſtma</hi> &amp; her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men might be ſet at liberty. For we hope ſaid they, to haue them acquited either by reaſon or arms. It is well ſaide anſwered the king, who ſent for the Damoſels to come vnto him, and afterward ſaid vnto them, Looke vp Ladies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold theſe Gentlemen which will defend your right, will you be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to put your quarrell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture your liues vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their force. Alas if it like your Maieſty anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Madaſima,</hi> ſeeing it pleaſeth them to affoord vs this good, wee doe put our liues into their hands, and your good mercy. Truſt mee Madame ſaide <hi>Imoſel,</hi> If there bee any heere which will gaineſay that you are not deliuered and ſet at liberty, behold me ready to proue the contrarie, &amp; if there be twelue together of the like opinion, wee are twelue likewiſe that wil hazard our liues for yours. Therewithall the king did caſt his eyes vpon <hi>Ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandel</hi> and <hi>Broquadan,</hi> and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that they hanged downe their heads, looking vpon the ground, ſo much amaſed, that they were not able to anſwer one word, wherefore the king ſaide vnto the knights of the Iſle. My Lords, I pray you to withdraw your ſelues for this day, and to morrow you ſhall haue anſwere of thoſe with whom you are to deale. Where-upon they all departed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the king called apart <hi>Broquadan &amp; Gandandel,</hi> vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid, come hither, you knowe
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7179:226"/>
that many times you haue ſolicited me to put theſe poore Damoſels to death, perſwading mee that it was iuſt and reaſon ſo to doe, and that if need were you &amp; your ſons would maintain this counſaile vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death. You haue heard what <hi>Imoſel</hi> and his fellowes haue ſaide vnto mee, which I doe thinke to be good &amp; right, wherefore it is time that you determine what to do. For by the faith that I owe vnto God, I will not permit that any other of my knights ſhall fight with them, &amp; if you look not vnto it, you ſhall bee anſwerable for all, and the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels deliuered. If it pleaſe your Maieſty, anſwered they, to morrow we will be ready to maintain what-ſoeuer we haue ſaide. And for that time they departed to their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, greatly troubled for that which they were to do. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſeeing that now there was no remedy, they determined to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in their daurned opinion by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of words onely, without putting themſelues or their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in danger: knowing aſſuredly that they were not able to reſiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe that were come from the Firme-Iſland. But it happened out ſo well for them, as the very ſame night newes came vnto the King, that <hi>Grumedaca</hi> the olde Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anteſſe was dead, and that a little before her death, ſhee had yeelded vp her ſtrong places into the hands of the kings people, beſeeching him to haue pitty vpon her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Madaſima.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon the next morning at their returne from church, hee cauſed the twelue knights of the Firme-Iſland to bee called, vnto whom he ſaid. My friends, you may carry away with you the Damoſels which you demand, when it ſhall pleaſe you, for I ſet them at liberty, becauſe that this night the Earle <hi>Latin</hi> hath written vnto me, that he hath the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza</hi> in his hands, and that the olde Gianteſſe is deceaſed. If any were glad here-of, you may beleeue that the two traitors <hi>Broquadan</hi> and <hi>Gandandel</hi> were nothing ſorry, for as much as they did perceiue that if this had not happened, their treaſon had bid diſcouered. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Imoſel</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the king. If your Maieſtie doe but <hi>Madaſima</hi> right, ſhee muſt not remaine poor nor diſinherited, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your grace knoweth that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are bound to obey their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents as ſhee hath done, more by feare then free will. And ſo if it pleaſe your Maieſty, vſing your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed liberality, you ſhould ſhewe her ſome grace and fauour, ſhewing thereby an example to all other vertuous and couragious Princes to do the like. <hi>Imoſel,</hi> ſayde the king, let it ſuffice you that the Damoſels are at liberty, for I cannot reuoke the gift which I haue made to my daughter <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> of the land which you demand. I moſt humbly beſeech your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, anſwered <hi>Galuanes,</hi> to haue pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vpon her and mee, who at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ought to hold the place deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her anceſtors, of whom ſhee is the lawfull inheretrix, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the land which you doe take from her: and if it pleaſe your highneſſe, in remembrance of the ſeruices which I haue done vnto you, you may reſtore them vnto vs to hold them of your grace by feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and homage. I haue ſaid enough my Lord <hi>Galuanes,</hi> anſwered the king, that which is done, cannot be vndone. Truſt me, anſwered he, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I can neither haue right nor reaſon of you, I will trie if I may get it ſome other way. Doe what you can, ſaid the king, I am in good
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7179:226"/>
hope ſeeing I haue won if fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then you, to deſend it againſt thoſe that are leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they. Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Galuanes,</hi> he which got it for you, hath bin very badly reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therefore. Care not you for that, ſaide the King, if he of whom you ſpeake dare but aduenture to aide you, I dare bee ſo bolde as to withſtand him, and to make him beſhrew himſelfe. <hi>Agraies</hi> hearing theſe threats, was exceeding an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and in great choller anſwered: Sir, although my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> was neuer other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring knight, yet did he that good for you which as yet you neuer recompenſed, for he hath many times defended you, and deliuered you from death. <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan</hi> did well perceiue that <hi>Agrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> entred into farther tearmes then was fit hee ſhould, for which cauſe he a little pulled him back, and ſaid vnto the king. Sir, although you be a king and a great Lord, yet it may be you ſhall finde ſomewhat to do, to vſe my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> in ſuch ſort as you threaten him. By my faith, ſaid <hi>Brian, Amadis</hi> hath done you too many ſeruices to be thus badly requited, eſpecially he being ſonne vnto a Prince as worthy as your ſelfe. Soft and faire <hi>Don Brian,</hi> ſaide the king, we know wel enough that you are one of his friends. I am and ſo ought to be, ſaid <hi>Brian,</hi> for euery one knoweth that I am his coſin german, and therefore it were a ſhame not to ſuccour him in his neede. Truely, anſwered the King, for the ſame cauſe doe I hold you excuſed. And as they were in theſe tearmes, <hi>Angriotta de Eſtrauaux,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sarquiles</hi> his Nephew came before the King, who beeing armed at all points, did their duty vnto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie: but when the knights of the Firme-Iſland did beholde them, they greatly wondered, for they knew nothing at al of this their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. Then <hi>Angriotta</hi> with a loud voice began his ſpeech in this manner. May it pleaſe your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, my Nephew and I heere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, do beſeech your grace to cauſe two traitors that are in your Court; <hi>Broquadan</hi> and <hi>Gandandel,</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before your Maieſtie, vnto whom I will declare the treaſon which they haue done againſt you. Much affrighted was <hi>Broquadan</hi> and his companion, hearing <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griotta</hi> ſpeake after this manner; who continuing his ſpeech ſaide: If it like your highneſſe, theſe two wicked perſons of whom I ſpeake, without reſpect or feare of God or men, haue faiſly accuſed my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> &amp; other of a matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they neuer ſo much as in thoght offended. By means whereof I dare well ſay, that you haue baniſhed from you the beſt Knights that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer entered, into Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> therefore if: thoſe traitours dare maintaine that they be not ſuch as I tearme the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> I alone, by the help of God, and the edge of my ſword will make them confeſſe it. And if they ought to bee excuſed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their age, there is neither of them both which hath not a ſonne of long time bearing armes, and well enough eſteemed of amongſt the Knights of your court, againſt whom I will fight if they will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the quarrell of their wicked fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Moſt mighty ſoueraigne, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Gandandel,</hi> doth not your grace ſee the boldnes of this proud iniurious fellow, who is come into this countrey to no other end, but onely to ſhame the Gentlemen of your court? By my faith if your Maieſtie would haue beleeued me long agoe, ſo ſoone as hee had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into your Realme, hee ſhould haue bin hanged vp, vpon the firſt

But by the faith of a Knight, if the King do but iuſtice vnto vs both, hee ſhall apparrantly perceiue thy great treaſon. There-with all <hi>Sarquiles</hi> ſtepped forth and kneeling downe, hee ſaid vnto the King: It is long ſince I did aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe your Maieſtie, that ſo ſoone as my Lord <hi>Angriotta</hi> heere preſent, ſhould come vnto your Court, I would let you vnderſtand that, which with my two eares I did hear ſpoken by the mouth of theſe two traitors: heereupon hee recited word by word, the whole conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he had heard, whereat al they that were preſent did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wonder to heare ſuch conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies repeated.

haue ſo many times declared vnto me, that <hi>Amadis</hi> and his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates had determined to betray me, and to vſurpe vpon mee the land of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe when it is come to an iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, you excuſe your ſelues from the combate, ſetting your ſons to maintaine your wickedneſſe, who cannot doe therewithall, notwith-ſtanding God is iuſt, &amp; by all that I do owe vnto him, it is very lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken of you, neuer would I euer haue thought you ſuch as you are. May it pleaſe your Maieſty anſwered <hi>Gandandel,</hi> our children ſeeing vs too ſlow in our iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, put themſelues forward to maintaine the honour of their fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers. They had reaſon ſayd <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan,</hi> for hardly could you haue recouered any others, &amp; no doubt but you are men of little worth, or reputation, for the Diuell could neuer haue inuented ſuch wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as you haue ſet abroach, ſo as if the King ſhould cauſe a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch as you are to be hanged, yet could hee not holde him ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the treacherie which you haue done vnto him, but your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall beare the puniſhment for you. My Lord <hi>Grumedan</hi> ſaid they, although you wiſh it ſo, yet ſhall it not haphen ſo, if God pleaſe: for our ſonnes deliuering vs from ſhame, ſhall obtaine the victorie with honour. You ſhall ſee ſayd <hi>Grumedan</hi> what the iſſue will bee. And becauſe this talke continued longer then the King liked, hee ſent euery man vnto his lodging. And the ſame night thoſe which the next morning were to performe the combate, did looke that nothing might be wanting in their armour, eſpecially <hi>Angriotta</hi> and his Nephew, who withdrewe them vnto a Chappell where they continued in prayer vntill the day breake. And becauſe the King had receiued iniurious ſpeeches by the twelue knights of the Iſland, they went vnto their tents, with <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima</hi> and her Damoſels, where they remained all that night. But the day appearing, they all mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted on horſeback, &amp; came to accompany their fellowes <hi>Angriotta</hi> and <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiles,</hi> vnto the place of combate, there were already arriued the King, Princes, and Lords, with the Queen &amp; the other Ladies. Thus the combatants entred into the field, <hi>Angriotta</hi> and <hi>Sarquiles</hi> on the one ſide, <hi>Tarin, Corian</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> on the other ſide.

Then turning his face, he ſaw <hi>Tarin</hi> ready with his ſword in his hand: who beholding his brother ouerthrowne, came with great rage againſt <hi>Angriotta,</hi> &amp; thinking to ſtrike him vpon the top of the helmet, the blow fell ſhort, and lighted vpon the head of his horſe, wherewith hee was grieuouſly wounded. Notwith-ſtanding <hi>Angriotta</hi> finding that he was neere his enemy, he hit him ſo ſoundly with his ſworde, that with the ſtroke hee vnhorſed him, and at the ſame inſtant he himſelfe perceiued his horſe waxed faint, with the wound hee had receiued vpon his head, forſooke him and leaped on the ground. Then with his ſhield on his arme, he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him whom he had firſt ouer-throwne,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7179:228"/>
who was already riſen vp &amp; marched againſt <hi>Angriotta.</hi> And thus began the combate betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two, where ſhortly after came <hi>Tarin</hi> in like ſorte, and <hi>Angriotta</hi> was to anſwere them both: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he did make knowne, that he was not to ſeeke in ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity: for hee had led them ſo roundly that hee gaue them not ſo much leaſure as to take their breath, ſo that in leſſe ſpace then an houre, their armour was hacked in peeces, &amp; they ſo wounded that the blood ran downe on all parts. I beleeue there is none of you all that doth heare this Hiſtory, who vnderſtandeth not well enough, that <hi>Angriotta</hi> could not defend himſelfe ſo well, but that hee felt ſome part of the ſtrokes, for he was ſore wounded in many places, yet was it nothing in reſpect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. In the meane time <hi>Sarquiles,</hi> whom <hi>Damas</hi> had in hand, began to be aſhamed with the ouer great reſiſtance that his enemy made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and for the ſame cauſe ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſpurs vnto his horſe, he found the meanes to buckle with his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: and as they were ſtrugling together and ſtriuing who ſhould fall firſt, <hi>Angriotta</hi> doubting that his Nephew would haue the worſt, drew towards him, but before hee came neer vnto him, <hi>Sarquiles</hi> and <hi>Damas</hi> fell down one vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another: By this means was their incounter re-enforced, becauſe that <hi>Angriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> endeauoured to ſuccour his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, &amp; the others to relieue their kinſman: Who being vnder <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiles</hi> could by no meanes riſe vp, for <hi>Sarquiles</hi> held him ſo ſhort, that pulling off his helmet, hee thruſt his ſword into his throat, then ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his enemy dead hee left him there, &amp; came running vpon <hi>Tarin</hi> and his companion, who were in a manner out of breath, &amp; ready to yeeld, or to ask mercie. The which the King, <hi>Broquadan</hi> &amp; <hi>Gandan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Notwithſtanding although they were diſpleaſed with this ſight, yet all the reſt of the Court there preſent, tooke pleaſure to behold it, for the loue which they did beare vnto <hi>Amadis</hi> &amp; his friends. And more gladder yet were they when they ſaw them brought to the extreamity of their vnhappy end. For ſcant had the King turned his head fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but that <hi>Angriotta</hi> did hit <hi>Corian</hi> ſo forcible a blow, that hee quite cut off all his right ſhoulder: with the extreame griefe whereof, giuing a ſigne of his death, he fell downe kiſſing the ground with his noſe, after whom <hi>Tarin</hi> ſtaied not long before he did as much.</p>
                  <p>Thus were the ſons of theſe trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſlaine, for the which <hi>Madaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Oriana,</hi> and many others did greatly reioyce. Then <hi>Angriotta</hi> &amp; his Nephewes tooke the bodies of the vanquiſhed, and dragged them forth of the fields, afterwards they demaunded of the Iudges if they had performed as much as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, who anſwered that they had. Whereupon they both rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in great triumph, &amp; accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with their friends, they came vnto the tents of their fellowes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
