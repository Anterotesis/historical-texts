         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of God in this generation, as a people called of him, and redeemed by him for his glories sake; even so Amen, and Amen. Dearly beloved, be not ignorant, but this know, This is the Message which came unto you, which is true and faithful, and everlasting, That the true God is light, and in him is no darkness at all; and this is the Message of Peace and Reconciliation, and of glad tydings unto all that have sought the Lord, which we received of him, and you have heard, and there is not another to be declared; and all that have received it, are gathered up to God, and are in Covenant with him, and one with another, and are in that which reconcileth and joyneth unto Christ Jesus (the Husband) and second <hi>Adam,</hi> who is the Lord from Heaven, the Prince of Peace, the Saviour and the deliverer, who is made manifest in Power, and condemneth the Transgressor, and slayeth the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and raiseth the life out of death; and this is he who kills and makes alive, even the God who is light, who brings down one, and sets up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who makes war against the mighty, and gives Peace to the poor; and besides him there is none; he searcheth mans heart, and tryeth the reins, and knows the thoughts, and every creature is manifest in his sight, who gives to every one according to his doings; and this is he who standeth in the Congregation of the righteous, even in the midst of us, &amp; sitteth Judge among the gods, unto him must all the gods of the earth bow, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth must tremble before him, and unto him every Tongue shall confess, and the light in every man shall answer when he ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to judgement, who is a swift witness to condemn or justifie all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men upon the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>This is the God of truth whom we worship, and who will be worshipped in spirit and in truth, who is the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed for ever; and with him there is no change, nor shadow of turning; and he hath made known his Name, and his Power, and his wonderful works in this his day, and hath caused his voice to be heard in the earth, and the dead hath heard and now liveth.</p>
            <p>And his Name is exalted on high amongst all that fear him and obey his voice; and he hath given his Son a Covenant of Light, who lighteth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that cometh into the world with the true Light of Life, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that all who receive him may come to the knowledge of the Father, whom to know is life eternal.</p>
            <p>And this is the Christ, the Saviour, in which we have believed, and which we preach, who is the Way, the Truth and the Life, the Foundation of God which cannot be moved, the Word of God is his Name, and there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name given for salvation. This is he that was dead, and is alive, and lives for evermore; and there is no other to be looked for; if any preach any other, let him be accursed; and if any bring any other Message, let them not be received.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52868:3"/>And all you who have believed in this Christ Jesus, who is the Light of the world, and who have received the knowledge of this God, who is light himself, and that searcheth your hearts, I exhort you, and warn you all in his presence that lives for ever, to wait upon him, and to fear before him, and to walk with him for ever in uprightness of heart, which is of great price in his sight, and forget not his righteous Judgements which he hath made known, least you wax fat through mercies, and rebel against him, and become disobedient and gainsaying, and so be destroyed from being a people; but be stayed upon the Lord, and let your hearts be established with grace, and be not tossed nor shaken with any wind of Doctrines of men, which is not from the life of God, nor reaches to the life in you, but begets into Idolatry, to worship other Gods then he who is light; and be not troubled at temptations, nor at sufferings, nor at reproaches, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but stand in the Counsel of God, and in his long-suffering, and wait patiently upon him in your own measure of the grace of God received, which is sufficient for you to preserve you, that victory over death and over him that hath the power over it, you may receive, to trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that which is contrary to the life of God within you, and without you; neither be you troubled nor offended in Christ if any among you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Lord, and backslide from his pure way through an evil heart of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and so become disobedient children, and vex the righteous soul; such shall bear their own burthen and condemnation in the day of the Lord; and know, that truth changes not, but is the same for ever, though the deceitful hearted, through unbelief, depart from it, and choose their own wayes, and despise the Counsel of the Lord to their own destruction; but be ye more watchful, and faithful, and valiant for the truth upon earth unto the end, that you may be found faithful witnesses unto the Name of the Lord in this crooked Generation, and may receive the fulfilling of the Promise of God, and may witness God with you, the Emanuel, the Saviour, God with us; and this is the whole salvation, and there is no other to be expected or witnessed then this, That God dwells in us, and walks in us, according to his Promise; and all that know this, needs not go forth to the right hand or to the left; but salvation is come unto us, he that takes away sin, and saves from it, and from condemation; and who witnesseth this, are begotten by the Word of God, and born of the immortal Seed, and are new creatures; and there is now no condemnation, but the reward of righteousness and peace to us, who are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit; and here we witness the Lord is our God, and we are his people, and he sees no sin in us who are born of him, nor remembers iniquity; but his Covenant is with us, and the Kingdome is become the Lords, and his Dominion is set up, where God is all in all, where the Prince of Darkness is cast out; and this is the end and substance of all Ministrations, which we bare witness of, and I do exhort all you that are called of God every where, patiently to wait in the way of the Lord, and in his Judgements to receive this, and to possess it

within you, that you may be worshippers of God, and doers of his will, and may have the witness that you are accepted of him, and may know your calling and election sure, where nothing that defileth can enter, but that may be taken away and removed, and him you may feel and witness, which <hi>Satan</hi> hath nothing in, who is the second <hi>Adam,</hi> and cannot be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, but is greater then the first <hi>Adam</hi> who was overcome (though inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent) and is lost from the presence of God; but he in whom there is no sin, &amp; who cannot transgresse, comes to seek &amp; to save that which was lost in sin, and to bring back that which was driven away by sin; and he is greater then innocency, and overcometh the Devil, and is called the Son of God; and to him that overcometh, who is the Light of the world, is all Power given of the Father: And know him in you all to be the greatest, who is not of the world, nor cannot bow to the Devil, to give you dominion and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over all the world, and the powers of Hell and Death, even he who sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth up the old Dragon in Perdition never more to deceive: And who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth this, knoweth the Election which it is not possible to deceive, or be deceived; and as every one of you hath received him who is the Lord from Heaven, so let your faith stand in him, and walk in him; and let all your conversations be ordered by him, in all pure and blameless walking in the sight of your Enemies, that it may be manifest that you are branches in him, and that you have received power to become the sons of God, and that you are heirs of the Inheritance which shall not fade away. And all you that witness this, your eye is opened to see God, and you are cleansed from sin by the Word of God, and you have received the peace with God, and glad tydings from him in your own souls; and this is salvation by the second <hi>Adam</hi>; herein be established and setled, and look not for another; for there is not any besides this Saviour and this salvation, but if any preach another, believe them not; and if any cry, Lo here, and lo there is Christ without you, go not after them, nor follow them, but know him within you, which is greater then all; yea, If we our selves, or an Angel from heaven, preach any other Jesus then he which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, or any other salvation then God with us, let us be accursed; for this is the Gospel of our salvation, Christ Jesus within us the hope of glory, the Power and Wisdom of God to rule and reign in us, by which we are changed from death to life, and translated from the power of darkness into the kingdom of his dear Son.</p>
            <p>And now all Friends and Elect of God, who are called and faithful, you that have received this Testimony which God hath given of the Son, and which the Son hath given of the Father, which in faithfulness hath been testified in this generation, I exhort you all in the fear and counsel of the Lord, take heed to that which you have believed, and heard, and learned of the Father, which is the truth as it is in Jesus, and shall abide for ever; and be not removed from your hope, nor given to change, but minde the

            <p>Again, believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which is at liberty in the flesh, and makes the offence of the cross to cease, which is exalted out of the fear of the Lord in the liberty of the earthly, which crucifies the life, and darkens the eye; and that spirit will boast of joy, and peace, and experience, and knowledge, and speak high words in the airy mind, and that would lead you out of your conditions to glory above the cross, till you be past feeling of the life; and that spirit begets into feignedness and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and into the love of the world which passes away; and beware of that spirit, for it is not of the Father, but to be condemned.</p>

nature which is to be famished, and glories in what hath been done by it as though it had not received power from the Lord, and is exalted as though it bare the root, not knowing that it is born of the root; and that spirit spends its Treasure which it received in the Fathers house, amongst Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, and despises the poor, and seeks occasion to glory over the weak, that it may be renowned; beware of that spirit I charge you all, for it is not of the Father, nor to be followed, but to be condemned, and resisted unto death.</p>
            <p>Again, Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which preaches not from the measure of God received, and to be manifest to it in you, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by it only, but speaks above the measure, and reaches not to the measure of the grace of God; that spirit leads after words and outward shews, and cryes peace to the rich, and judgement to the poor; &amp; the word of God is not divided aright, but heals up falsly, and daubs with untem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered morter, and cryes peace where Gods speaks war; and cryes war where God speaks peace; and that spirit is a deceiver and a betrayer, and feeds but the ear, and not the life, and darkens the counsel of God by words without knowledge, and is not of the Father, but of the world, &amp; to be denyed and condemned.</p>
            <p>Again, Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which is not subject to rule and order, and is not meek, and diligent, and long suffering, but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and high, and untoward, seeking occasions against the Just, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for evil; that spirit will not bear reproof, but is idle, sloathful, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and surmising evil, and backbiting, and conforms in appearance, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a fair shew, but is not unto God, as appearing unto man; and that would go, and is not called; and will not go when it is called; and seeks for the praise of men more then God, and that is fruitless ground, and brings forth bryars and thorns in secret, which choaks the seed of God; beware of that spirit, it is a lover of this world; have no fellowship with it, for it is not of the Father, but a deceiver, and is to be denyed.</p>
            <p>Again, Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which is tossed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled, and is given to change, and is not established with grace, that is an Adulterer, and hunts for the precious life, and seeks by flattery to beguile the innocent; that spirit is zealous for a moment, but is soon overcome, and is stony ground, and brings not forth fruit to perfection, but withers, and its later end is worse then the beginning. That spirit is exalted into presumption, and in peace, and cast into desparation and trouble, and the double mind lodgeth in it, and it is unstable in all its wayes, &amp; is a ground for the seed of Satan, and to it there is no peace from God; and beware of that spirit, for it is not of the Father, but to be condemned.</p>
            <p>Again, Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which is more zealous then knowing, whose zeal is without true knowledge, and stands in that which is corrupted, that flourisheth for a moment; but cannot endure for ever; it hath no root in it self, but is furious and passionate, and not long-suffering,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52868:6"/>
that spirit knows not it self, but would devour its adversary with bitterness, and not gain'd by long suffering; that is not the Spirit of the Father, but must be denyed in all.</p>
            <p>Again, Believe not that spirit which draws back into the world, into its lusts, and liberty, and fashions which passeth away; that spirit forgets God, and draws back, for his soul hath no pleasure in it, but is vexed with it, where the cross is made of non-effect, and the false Liberty is walked in, which murders the life; that spirit is of the Devil, and is to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>And now all friends of God every where, who knows him, and are known of him whom he hath gathered out of this untoward generation; be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in your Callings, and keep your meetings in faithfulness, waiting upon the Lord, that you all may receive of his fulness to be filled with it, and may be nourished up unto himself, as Trees of righteousness, the planting of his own right hand, to spread forth his name and glory, as a people sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him, and to whom there is none like besides. And this know and understand, that spirit is not of the Father which confesseth not the Son to be come in the flesh, who destroys the works of the Devil, and takes away sin; and that spirit it believe and follow which condemns sin, and destroys it, and takes it away, and so gives peace with God in your own consciences, and leads you into all truth, and keeps you from all evil; &amp; you that witness this, the Son you know, and the Father you know to dwell with you, and in you; and this is the first and the last; believe in him, and follow him, and look not for any other; and in this the Father of Life and Glory, whose Dominion is without beginning and end, establish you, and preserve you, <hi>Amen,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>THE glorious God of truth hath appeared and made known his way and truth perfectly in this our day, and hath chosen unto himself faithful Witnesses, to testifie of his Name, and of his Truth before Rulers and people, and hath brought forth a seed which is not of this world, which cannot bow to the Devil, but is heir of Gods Inheritance, though a sufferer in this world under the powers thereof, and many in this generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who are called, and faithful, and chosen, bears witness unto the Name of the Lord in sufferings and tribulations, whom he will honor because they honor him, who is exalting his Truth and his people through suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>And now all Friends who are called to suffer for the Testimony of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and for the exercise of a pure conscience which you hold, be valiant for the truth upon earth and faint not, but finish your Testimony with joy for the Lord, and against all your enemies, and look not forth at afflictions and sufferings, but look beyond them to the recompence of reward; neither be offended in Christ, though ye are called to suffer for him, and for his Names sake; but dwell in the peace with God, which is a sufficient reward; and take heed to your life which is Immortal, that it you may feel and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and account that the present sufferings is not worthy to be reckoned with the glory that is to be revealed, and of which you have the earnest, even present peace with God; and look beyond your sufferings, and before the rage of man was, and feel the life of God in you fresh and lively, which is more then all things, to carry you above all the world, and all its envy, which is against the seed of God.</p>
            <p>And take heed of temptations, for the power of Satan will work, and is near to tempt you in sufferings, to gain dominion over you, and to touch your life, and to cast you down: Therefore mind the life of God in you to have dominion, which <hi>Satan</hi> hath nothing in, which is not given him to touch; and that is more then all, yea all that a man hath will he give for his life to enjoy it when he is tryed; (this I witness) &amp; you are tryed by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and tribulations, and your faith and patience is proved; therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your selves faithful unto the Lord by long-sufferings and patience, that Satan overcome you not, though he may touch you, and have power to cast some of you into prison, and otherways to win now you, and to try you for your life; but be faithful unto death, and you shall receive the Crown

            <p>And all you that suffer for well doing, who holds fast the Testimony which you have received of God; now when your hearts are searched, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the Lord you are, your reward you shall possess, which no man can take away, even the life, and liberty, and treasure which Satan cannot touch nor spoyle you of.</p>
            <p>Ye that suffer because you cannot fulfil wickedness, nor the will of man, but are of the seed which cannot please man, nor bow to the Devil; ye suffer for Christ, and for righteousness sake; who cannot walk contrary to the light of Christ within you, but rather chooses to suffer under corrupt men and laws, then to transgress Gods righteous Law written in your hearts; you are chosen to fulfil the will of God by sufferings, and are not of the world, and therefore the world hates you.</p>
            <p>And all you that suffer imprisonment of body, or spoyling of Goods, or travels, or any other thing, because you cannot pay tythes, this is the word of the Lord God unto you, You suffer for righteousness sake, and for the Name of Christ, and unjustly, by the oppression of men for well-doing, &amp; not for evil; &amp; the Lord will be your exceeding great reward; look beyond your outward Liberty, and know the liberty in spirit, in the Father, and in the Son<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> where is everlasting peace and freedom, which none can bring into bondage; and look beyond all outward Treasure and Riches, and see Gods Treasure, and possess it, which never waxes old, which none can spoyle you of, as Witnesses for the Lord, and for his truth and Covenant; you suffer, and it is for a Testimony against all your Enemies, and against oppression, and oppressors; for the cry of that oppression the Land groans under, and for ages hath done; but the Lord is now risen against it, for its cry reacheth to Heaven against the unrighteous Exactors, whose cruel hands hath hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily oppressed the just and the poor in this particular; and herein your suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering is for a testimony against your cruel Adversaries, (whether Priests or others) and against the unjust Judges and Lawyers, and their whole train of Oppressors; for this end are you called to suffer, and to you it shall be made easie if you abide in the counsel of God, till vengeance overcome your adversaries; therefore lift up your heads, and fulfil the will of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in patience and in faithfulness, till the Lord appear for you, who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth to the cry of the poor, and regardeth the unjust sufferer, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the oppressors into their bosoms, and will break every yoke, and be a terror to all the cruel hearted.</p>

And resist the Devil on every hand with the Armour of Light and Truth, that your life may be preserved in Dominion over all things; even the life which is not of this world in you, may not be vailed nor overcome, for to enjoy the life of God with you is enough, if you pass through the fire and through the water, it keeps you, and carries you above all, [this I witness] and it is more then all outward freedom, or liberty, or riches and treasure of this world; and walk herein in bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and faithfulness, and patience, as you have us for an example in Christ Jesus, who are in Jeopardy every hour, often in trials, and sufferings, and dangers, and loves not our lives unto death for the Testimony of Jesus which we hold, and that his Name and Truth may be exalted in the earth; but as the Lord moves are carryed through Nations, among Lyons and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers, such as seeks our life for their prey, and yet the Lord is with us, our Defence, and Arm, and Preserver above all.
