         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>A Tumultuous Meeting.</p>

               <p>Ranters, Erroneous Fellows.</p>
               <p>For as much as this is not the fir≈øt time that we have been abu≈øed in this nature (as is well known to ≈øome godly and eminent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi>) it would favour of unan≈øwerable improvidence if we ≈øhould not faithfully endeavor to wa≈øh off that dirt which is ≈øo unworthily ca≈øt in the faces of us.</p>
               <p>Upon the fir≈øt day (commonly called <hi>Whit≈øunday</hi>) divers of the Separation met at Cornet <hi>Reads</hi> hou≈øe in <hi>Towciter,</hi> and after one friend had exerci≈øed his gifts, the Auditory did exceed the room; and by rea≈øon of the throng it was moved for better conveniency to go into the yard, which being of le≈øs continent then the room, by the advi≈øe of the Souldiery there pre≈øent, and ≈øome friends, under the penthou≈øe without door (taking the benefit of ≈øhade) was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged a convenient place; there Capt. <hi>Elliot</hi> (much about the

time of the ending of the evening Exerci≈øe at the publique place) ≈øpake a word of Exhortation, and the people gave him peaceable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Now that this Meeting might degenerate to tumultuous di≈øturbance of the Peace, that mu≈øt wholly lie at the door of <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Gore,</hi> and their adherents, who incen≈øed the Souldiery; but by the wi≈øe carriage of the Officers the bu≈øine≈øs was ea≈øily appea≈øed. Seriou≈øly this is hard mea≈øure, when Chri≈øtians ≈øhall be denyed that liberty which is commonly afforded to tho≈øe unrea≈øonable creatures who lick the crumbs of our tables.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are branded for <hi>Tomp≈øons</hi> Party; I cannot tell what to ≈øay to this allegation, ≈øeeing <hi>Tomp≈øon</hi> (his fury working his own de≈øtruction) is now under ground; but upon enquiry this is gatherd, that there was one at the Meeting that adhered to him, and by the Councel of State acquitted long ≈øince: Now if a Convention of people mu≈øt be mea≈øured by a ≈øingle per≈øon, by the≈øe mens Rea≈øon <hi>Sodomites</hi> were all righteous, becau≈øe one <hi>Lot</hi> inhabited the City.</p>
               <p>For the word <hi>Leveller</hi> is a term of <hi>odium</hi> ca≈øt upon many a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon for holding forth of righteous Principles: for tho≈øe who deny propriety under pretence of community, as we have no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them in ≈øuch a principle, ≈øo ≈øee we no rea≈øon to debar them from hearing of the Word preached.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Ranters, erroneous fellows, &amp;c.</hi> For calling tho≈øe that met <hi>Ranters,</hi> if their pa≈ø≈øion had not quite eat up their Rea≈øon, this ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence would not have pa≈ø≈øed, there being neither beer, wine, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or any other object which might provoke licentiou≈øne≈øs, made u≈øe of; be≈øides, tho≈øe who are involved in ≈øo ≈øad condition, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity mu≈øt turn Apo≈øtates unto prayer and preaching: Now had not the envy of the elder brother been too prevalent with them, if there came any of that judgment to the Exerci≈øe out of good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ought it not to be a matter of rejoycing? I am ≈øure Je≈øus Chri≈øt ≈øaith, there is joy in Heaven upon the like occa≈øion.</p>
               <p>And that the mouth of envy may be fully ≈øtopped, take a view of a Letter directed to Mr <hi>Ben≈øon,</hi> Commi≈ø≈øioner of the Peace, <hi>viz.</hi>
