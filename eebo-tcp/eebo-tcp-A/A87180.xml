         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To be wrapped up in ſilence (at ſome times) is an argument of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but at another ſeaſon ſilent perſons are rendered Acceſſaries. A tacite Spectator of a perſon in act of murder is an Abettor and Conſenter to the ſlaughter: Nay, there is a time when our own ſecrets may not be kept ſilent; but what hath been ſpoken private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ear of Underſtanding, muſt be publiquely declared on the top of that houſe or family wherein we are reſident: And when <hi>Iſrael</hi> is at a loſs in the way to <hi>Canaan,</hi> a voyce is crying in this Wilderneſs, <hi>Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight.</hi> Although the Spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> be priſoned by <hi>Herodians,</hi> and the manifeſtation of God in the Creature (as to fleſhly underſtanding) be killed, and continue in the grave (that earthly part of mankind) for a time; yet <hi>he</hi> that hath power to lay down his life, will alſo aſſume ſtrength to take it up again, and ſtriking dead thoſe Roman Souldiers of Unrighteouſneſs, will march in the Van of his Diſciples into <hi>Galilee.</hi> Now to track the way of him <hi>whoſe footſteps are in the Sea,</hi> is impoſſible; and to limit the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is forbidden; <hi>For the times and ſeaſons knoweth no man:</hi> But, if Wars and rumors of Wars, as well in Churches as Nations, Brethren (both in natural and Goſpel relation) betray one another to death, Stars of Heaven (ſpiritual men in high and heavenly places) be fallen, and the Powers of the Earth (worldly Kings and Potentates) be

ſhaken, from a <hi>figtree</hi> Calculation, there is ground for belief, that the coming of the Lord is nigh at hand, and another Meſſenger is coming down from Heaven (the preſence of God,) having great Power, and the Earth is lightened by his preſence, crying,<note n="*" place="margin">Perſecuting Spirit.</note>

            <p>The coming of the Lord (as I give my Judgment) is the Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Righteouſneſs in the Creation (as to mankind,) and for his perſonal Raign (which many godly perſons expect,) I rather rejoyce to ſee, then have faith to beleeve, and ſay to thoſe (termed Millena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) as to all others, who ſeek after Chriſt, though in never ſo vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adminiſtration to my apprehended light, <hi>So walk as ye have received, only let your Converſation be as becometh the Gospel.</hi>

Sir, By the <hi>ſeries</hi> of your diſcourſe it will appear, that you have not only judged before the time, but alſo prevaricated righteous Judgment: To condemn the innocent, or juſtifie the wicked, is equally abominated by the Judg of all men; and although you have ſtrained induſtry by Argument to maintain a Charge, ſeeing you have <note n="a" place="margin">Argumentum hoc ſolum quod ſit ſecundum pondus ad ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatum, dolus verſatur gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralibus, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne non diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guit.</note> levelled at a wrong ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, your Argument and Charge in the eye of Reaſon ſtand annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.

                  <label>SECT. II.</label> Another fallacy wherewith you blind the people, runneth thus: That there muſt be an outward Call, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to thoſe that preach the Goſpel; and though perſons may be gifted, yet they are not to exerciſe their gifts without Ordination; and that Chriſt gave Commiſſion to the Apoſtles, the Apoſtles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned others, by vertue of which ſucceſſive Power you are made Miniſters, and ſo you (of the Clergy) and you only, are to preach the Goſpel: <hi>How can they preach except they be ſent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> We anſwer; That gifts, graces, or ſpiritual experiments of the ways of God, give, and only give, principles of preaching: <hi>I ſaw</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>therefore I ſpake: The anointing it ſhall teach you: As every man hath received, ſo let him adminiſter the ſame, as good Stewards of the myſteries of God.</hi> That which you term Ordination (as I give my Judgment) in the primitive times had not reference to a creative nature, but to confirmation or witneſs bearing to Truth in perſons when they heard it preached or delivered; and this power of Ordination, or rather confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is equally centred in all illuminated perſons in fellowſhip of the Goſpel. Under the adminiſtration of the Law, <hi>If there aroſe a Prophet unto the Law and Teſtimony,</hi> for approbation; under the Goſpel, <hi>Try all things, take heed how you hear; if any man bring any other doctrine, let him be Anathema, (accurſed,)</hi> by whom? of all certainly that had knowledg in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>That there is an impoſſibility of preaching before they be ſent, is granted; but whether this miſſion hath any relation to man, there is a queſtion, it being evident that God, who is the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of every good work, is alſo the General to give Orders to all ſubordinate Inſtruments. <hi>I was</hi> (ſaith <hi>Amos</hi>) <hi>a Herds-man, and the Word of the Lord came unto me. The Goſpel which</hi> Paul <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was not received of man, neither taught of man, but by revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>after three years he went up to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem to ſee the Diſciples.</hi> Gal. 1. By this that is offered it appeareth, that Ordination (as you call it) <hi>viz.</hi> Pattent, Bond, or Licenſe from the creature, is not of neceſſity to the preaching of the Goſpel, yea though the Authority be derived from all or the generality of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers;

much leſs is that Authority <hi>authentick,</hi> which is abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (or takes its being) from a few Monopolizes, to wit, <hi>Popes,</hi> or their Subſtitutes, the <hi>Biſhops:</hi> And thus I draw a ſecond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>We <hi>reply,</hi> That if theſe Ordinances had, or ſhall (ſtanding yet unrepealed) be produced as an Evidence againſt us, I am confident all ingenuous ſpirits, in the way of the Separation, will yeeld peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Obedience thereunto, either doing or ſuffering: But I have it from rational and intelligible perſons, That divers Votes in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were meer Ingredients to ſet up a rigid <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> the onely ſtalking-horſe to uphold Monarchy, being the laſt refuge in order to the Kings re-inveſtigation: But now it's evident, though the devices of mans heart are many, yet the counſel of the Lord will ſtand; and neither that <note n="*" place="margin">Mr <hi>Lilly</hi> had over-rated it if worth a halfpenny.</note> farthing Directory or Monarchial Intereſt are like to receive reſurrection, the vanity of thoſe Idols being <hi>(ex ſuperabundanti)</hi> manifeſted to every unbiaſſed perſon; and the heart of the Magiſtrate ſeemeth to caſt a more favorable aſpect then formerly, witneſs that Act entituled, <hi>An Act for the relief of

peaceable People,</hi> to which I add that candid expreſſion mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Parliaments Declaration in anſwer to the <hi>Scots</hi> Papers, <hi>Febr.</hi> 17. 1648. pag. 16. <hi>For the Toleration of all Religions and Forms of Worſhips that their Letter objects, we known not whom they intend in that Charge: as for the truth and power of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it being a thing intrinſecal between God and the Soul, and the matters of Faith being ſuch as no natural light doth reach unto, We conceive there is no humane power of coertion thereunto, nor to reſtrain men from beleeving what God ſuffers their judgments to be perſwaded of: But if they mean onely the outward and publique Forms of Profeſſion or Worſhip, we know no ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration endeavored or intended amongst us, neither yet do we finde any warrant to perſecute all that do not worſhip God, or profeſs to beleeve in the ſame Form that we do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the grief of every <hi>humane</hi>-like ſpirit to ſee <hi>Mordecai</hi> favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, although he juſtly may have merited the ſame; and what ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A Tumultuous Meeting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tompſons</hi> Party, Levellers.</p>
               <p>Ranters, Erroneous Fellows.</p>
               <p>For as much as this is not the firſt time that we have been abuſed in this nature (as is well known to ſome godly and eminent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi>) it would favour of unanſwerable improvidence if we ſhould not faithfully endeavor to waſh off that dirt which is ſo unworthily caſt in the faces of us.</p>
               <p>Upon the firſt day (commonly called <hi>Whitſunday</hi>) divers of the Separation met at Cornet <hi>Reads</hi> houſe in <hi>Towciter,</hi> and after one friend had exerciſed his gifts, the Auditory did exceed the room; and by reaſon of the throng it was moved for better conveniency to go into the yard, which being of leſs continent then the room, by the adviſe of the Souldiery there preſent, and ſome friends, under the penthouſe without door (taking the benefit of ſhade) was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged a convenient place; there Capt. <hi>Elliot</hi> (much about the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117976:9"/>
time of the ending of the evening Exerciſe at the publique place) ſpake a word of Exhortation, and the people gave him peaceable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Now that this Meeting might degenerate to tumultuous diſturbance of the Peace, that muſt wholly lie at the door of <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Gore,</hi> and their adherents, who incenſed the Souldiery; but by the wiſe carriage of the Officers the buſineſs was eaſily appeaſed. Seriouſly this is hard meaſure, when Chriſtians ſhall be denyed that liberty which is commonly afforded to thoſe unreaſonable creatures who lick the crumbs of our tables.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are branded for <hi>Tompſons</hi> Party; I cannot tell what to ſay to this allegation, ſeeing <hi>Tompſon</hi> (his fury working his own deſtruction) is now under ground; but upon enquiry this is gatherd, that there was one at the Meeting that adhered to him, and by the Councel of State acquitted long ſince: Now if a Convention of people muſt be meaſured by a ſingle perſon, by theſe mens Reaſon <hi>Sodomites</hi> were all righteous, becauſe one <hi>Lot</hi> inhabited the City.</p>
               <p>For the word <hi>Leveller</hi> is a term of <hi>odium</hi> caſt upon many a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for holding forth of righteous Principles: for thoſe who deny propriety under pretence of community, as we have no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them in ſuch a principle, ſo ſee we no reaſon to debar them from hearing of the Word preached.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Ranters, erroneous fellows, &amp;c.</hi> For calling thoſe that met <hi>Ranters,</hi> if their paſſion had not quite eat up their Reaſon, this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence would not have paſſed, there being neither beer, wine, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or any other object which might provoke licentiouſneſs, made uſe of; beſides, thoſe who are involved in ſo ſad condition, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity muſt turn Apoſtates unto prayer and preaching: Now had not the envy of the elder brother been too prevalent with them, if there came any of that judgment to the Exerciſe out of good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ought it not to be a matter of rejoycing? I am ſure Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, there is joy in Heaven upon the like occaſion.</p>
               <p>And that the mouth of envy may be fully ſtopped, take a view of a Letter directed to Mr <hi>Benſon,</hi> Commiſſioner of the Peace, <hi>viz.</hi>
