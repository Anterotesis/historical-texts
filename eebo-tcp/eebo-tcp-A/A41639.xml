            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE ſtrong and almoſt invincible Inclination I have to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and Retirement, with a natural averſion from the Controverſies of this Age, wherein there is ſo little of Chriſtian Candor, Fidelitie, Ingenuitie, and Moderation to be found, hath given me no ſmall ſatisfaction in my being exemted hitherto from thoſe vexatious Conflicts which I ſee many learned and pious men involved in: and it ſeems to me a thing no leſſe than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, to conſider, with what warm zele and ſelf-complacence ſome learned men contend in the miſts and clouds of ambiguous termes, as if they had no other deſigne but that of ſome Mercenary Soldiers, who do what they can to protract the War. Theſe and ſuch like conſiderations have kept me, for ſome Moneths, from the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Diſcourſe, with hopes there might be found out ſome Expedients for the putting a period to thoſe unhappy Controverſies it refers to, which I now have little hopes of. But enough of that.</p>
            <p>The Diſcourſe it ſelf both as to its firſt conception and preſent publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, has not been without various agitations in mine own thoughts; and how little my natural Inclinations have induced me hereto, is wel known to ſome. But I muſt confeſſe, the crime charged on us being no leſſe than Blaſphemie againſt the God of Heaven, it may be deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly judged too great a violation to the Laws of Chriſtianitie not to purge our ſelves from ſo black an Imputation; and yet in as much as ſome reverend Divines, of repute among us both for their Learning and Pietie, have entertained Sentiments oppoſite to our Hypotheſis, we have been very ſtudious, yea emulous to deliver our own thoughts in ſuch a mode or forme, as may be leaſt obnoxious to paſſionate emotions, perſonal reflexions, or whatever may unbeſeem one that lies under eſſential obligation to love and honor the Perſons of ſome that differ in Judgement about theſe points. Wherefore, to render our Diſcourſe the leſſe offenſive, we have caſt it into a <hi>thetic</hi> and <hi>dogmatic</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, rather than <hi>agoniſtic</hi> and <hi>polemic.</hi> And becauſe it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impoſſible diſtinctly and demonſtratively to diſcuſſe ſuch an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> without ſome oppoſition againſt ſuch as defend the <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> we have pitcht on <hi>Strangius</hi> as our principal Antagoniſt, who indeed,
<pb facs="tcp:57509:3"/>
to give him his merited character, has ventilated this Controverſie with candor, perſpicuitie, and force of Argument beyond his Sectators. Yet we muſt alſo do the Cauſe we undertake this juſtice, as to declare, that we have not omitted to examine the Reaſons and Arguments of other Reverend Divines, who oppoſe our Hypotheſis, albeit we have, as in dutie we conceived our ſelves obliged, conceled their Names. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, of what uſe are ſuch perſonal Nominations and Reflexions, but to render us a grief to Friends, and reproche to Enemies?</p>
            <p>As for my Stile, if any judge my pen too much drenched in Scholaſtic Theologie, I ſhal not denie, but that I have ſpent ſome time in thoſe Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, neither do I as yet ſee any reaſon to repent thereof; for I have found thoſe Controverſies about Divine Concurſe and Efficacious Grace, no where more accurately examined and demonſtratively determined, than among the Scholemen, ſpecially, <hi>Bradwardine</hi> and <hi>Alvarez,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I conceive how any one can diſtinctly and perfectly diſcuſſe theſe Controverſies, ſpecially as now miſerably perplexed with ambiguous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure termes, without ſome inſpection into and knowledge of Scholaſtic Theologie. For doth not a principal part of the Controverſie depend on that ſcholaſtic Notion of <hi>Free-will?</hi> Yea, is there any thing New ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Arminians or New Methodiſts, but what has been fully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and anſwered by ſome among the more ſober Scholemen, ſpecially <hi>Aquinas, Ariminenſis, Bradwardine</hi> and <hi>Alvarez.</hi> Whatever others may judge of them, yet Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter, Cathol. Theol.</hi> Part 1. p. 124. prefers the Scholemen before Arminians. And albeit I have a particular kindneſſe for ſome of the more ſober Scholemen, as to ſuch points wherein they ſerve not the Papal Intereſt, and their own vain Imaginations; yet what a low and cheap eſtime I have of the Scholemen in the general, is ſufficiently apparent, by the Character I have given them, <hi>Court of the Gentiles,</hi> Part III. B. 2. c. 2. S. 1. §<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I would read them, with the ſame indifference and ſuſpenſion of mind, as I read <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> But to conclude, if any private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian deſires, not to charge his thoughts with the Scholaſtic part of this Controverſie, but only to ſatisfie his Douts and confirme his Faith in the Scriptural part, he may confine himſelf to <hi>Chap. III.</hi> of this Diſcourſe, (which contains almoſt a third Part of the Book) where we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeven general Heads largely given the Scriptural Demonſtrations of our Hypotheſis, <hi>Touching Gods Concurſe to the entitative Act of Sin,</hi> with Solutions to ſuch falſe Gloſſes and Comments as our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries give thereto; which are ſuited to Vulgar Capacities.</p>

                     <p>§. 1. THE Doctrine of <hi>Divine Concurſe, and Creatural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Origine of the Controverſie.</note> has in al Ages of the Church, but more ſpecially ſince the riſe of Pelagianiſme, received vigorous aſſaults from many learned and potent Adverſaries: and indeed no wonder, ſithat corrupt Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated from <hi>Adam</hi> has, in imitation of its firſt parent, been ever aſpiring after an equality to the Deitie; and that not only in being the <hi>laſt End</hi> of its Acting, but alſo the <hi>firſt Principe</hi> of its Dependence. This vain attemt has appeared more viſibly in ſome daring and proud ſpirits, ſuch as <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> Dan. 4. 30. <hi>Is not this great Babylon that I have built,</hi> &amp;c? But in others the Deſign and oppoſition againſt the Concurſe of God has been more refined, under a pretext of vindicating the Divine Majeſty from the blaſphemous imputation of being the <hi>Author of ſin.</hi> And becauſe al pious Souls have ſo great a veneration for the Bleſſed Deitie, as to abhor the very ſhadow of ſuch Blaſphemie, therefore the Adverſaries of Divine Concurſe have in al Ages pitcht on this as the moſt puiſſant argument to oppoſe the ſame, that it brings the moſt holy and bleſſed God under the black im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of encouraging, yea impelling men to Sin. And albeit thoſe that aſſert Gods efficacious Concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater or entitative act of ſin, do moſt vehemently deteſt in their own ſouls, and ſolemnly proteſt againſt the leaſt thought or opinion that makes God the Author of ſin, yet nevertheleſs this direful piece of blaſphemie is ſtil charged on them. Moreover, there being in this Doctrine of Efficacious Concurſe (as in al other great Myſteries of Faith) ſome intricate difficulties, which the wiſe God has left us under, to trie our faith and ſubmiſſion to divine Revelation; hence alſo many learned, and ſome pious
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57509:6"/>
men have been at a great loſs in their Inquiries, how to reconcile the Libertie of the human Wil with the Efficace of Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe, ſo as to free the bleſſed God from the imputation of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling men to Sin. Theſe and ſuch like conſiderations made me the more prolixe in the philoſophic metaphyſic contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Divine Concurſe,</hi> its <hi>Nature, Origine,</hi> and <hi>manner of working,</hi> particularly as to the <hi>entitative act</hi> of what is ſinful; together with the <hi>creatures Dependence</hi> thereon: which I have more fully diſcuſſed, <hi>Court of the Gentiles,</hi> Chap. 7, 9, 11. with deſign and endeavours, if it might be, to give the bleſſed God and his ſinful Creature both their dues, and remove thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes which men are apt to fal into.</p>
                     <p>But theſe my ſincere deſires and endeavours have not had that<note place="margin">The method of our procedure.</note> ſucceſs which was deſired; which brings me under a freſh obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to vindicate mine own Hypotheſis, touching <hi>the efficacious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe of God to the ſubſtrate mater or entitative act of what is ſinful.</hi> I muſt confeſs, the province before us is difficult on many accounts, but principally, becauſe whiles we endeavour to defend the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe and Providence of God about the entitative act of ſin, it is ſuggeſted by ſome, and believed by others, that we make the holy God the <hi>Author of ſin,</hi> which is the dregs of blaſphemie, and that which every ſerious ſpirit abhors more than Hel. Yet we need no way to dout, but that, with divine aſſiſtance, we may firmly aſſert and demonſtrate the efficacitie of Divine concurſe to the material entitative act of that which is ſinful, and yet fully vindicate the Divine Majeſtie from that blaſphemous Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of being the Author of ſin. And for our more diſtinct and demonſtrative procedure herein, we propoſe this method or form as moſt apt for the ſubject mater before us. (1) To examine and explicate the Terms formally implied in, or virtually rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to, the ſubject in controverſie. (2) To ſhew wherein the oppoſite parties agree, and wherein they differ both among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and each from other; together with the original and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal motives, grounds, and cauſes of ſuch Differences. (3) To give a Scriptural Explication and Demonſtration of our own Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, touching Gods efficacious concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of that which is ſinful; with an anſwer to thoſe falſe gloſſes and comments, which our Adverſaries the Jeſuites, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians, and ſome new Methodiſts give to thoſe Scriptures for the evading the force of them. (4) To draw up a brief Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57509:7"/>
or Narrative of this controverſie, and its ſtate in al periods of the Chriſtian Churches to this day. (5) To give the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of our Hypotheſis from Reaſons grounded on Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with the Vindication of thoſe Reaſons from the unground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed invalid anſwers given to them by our opponents, <hi>Strangius,</hi> and others. (6) To ſolve and anſwer the Objections urged by thoſe that oppoſe our Hypotheſis, particularly <hi>Strangius, Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Le Blanc,</hi> with others. (7) And finally, to lay down the proper Sentiments and Hypotheſes of the Orthodoxe about this ſubject, in oppoſition to thoſe falſe Opinions which their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries charge upon them: as alſo to produce the proper opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the adverſe party, and the dangerous conſequences that naturally and neceſſarily flow from them.</p>
                     <p>§. 2. Our firſt and indeed principal task, in order to a clear<note place="margin">The explication of the Termes.</note> and demonſtrative procedure in this controverſie, wil be, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the termes, and diſabuſe them from thoſe ambiguities, confuſions, and falſe impoſitions, in which at preſent they are involved. And here indeed I cannot but break forth into a doleful Lamentation over the bleeding ſtate of the Churches of Chriſt, by reaſon of thoſe vexatious controverſies which rend and tear out their very bowels, and al from the ſophiſtic abuſe or Ambiguitie of termes. And I no way dout but to make it moſt manifeſt, when opportunitie is offered, that moſt of the controverſies of this Age are ſomented and maintained from the obſcuritie and abuſe of termes miſapplyed by ſubtile wits, for the eſtabliſhment of their own Hypotheſes. This is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in our preſent caſe, which makes it a duty abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, before we enter on our province, to clear up the way by a diſtinct and particular explication of thoſe termes that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late thereunto.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Terme we are to conſider is <hi>Sin:</hi> wherein we are to<note place="margin">Of Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

As for the <hi>Origine</hi> of Sin, it<note place="margin">1. Its Origine.</note> came firſt into the world from the <hi>Defectibilitie</hi> of our firſt Parents their Free-wil, and has been ever ſince maintained and fomented by the <hi>Vitioſitie</hi> of human nature depraved by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, as we have copioſely demonſtrated, <hi>Court Gent.

                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57509:7"/>2. Sin, as to its <hi>material conſtitution,</hi> has for its ſubſtrate mater<note place="margin">2. Its ſubſtrate mater.</note> or ſubject ſome natural good: For al ſin being, as to its formal nature, but a <hi>moral privation</hi> or <hi>relation,</hi> it neceſſarily requires ſome natural good as its ſubſtrate mater or ſubject. The wiſe Creator and Gubernator of althings has by his Law ſo conſtituted al <hi>moral</hi> Beings, both Virtues and Vices, as that they cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt but in ſomething <hi>natural:</hi> albeit ſin be, according to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal reaſon, a mere privation, yet it requires ſome poſitive, real natural Being for its ſubject, according to the nature of al other privations. Thus <hi>Auguſtin: That which is evil by reaſon of vice,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Quod malum eſt per vitium, bonum eſt per naturam, <hi>Aug. contra Adverſ. Leg. &amp; Prophet. cap.</hi> 5.</note> 
                        <hi>is good by nature.</hi> Again he ſaith, <hi>That ſin is not nature, but the vice of nature.</hi> And that trite Maxime communly received by al the Ancients, <hi>That al evil is founded in ſome good, i. e.</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſufficiently demonſtrates this our aſſertion. Thus <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin, Enchirid. 97. Although therefore things ſinful, as ſinful are not good; yet not only that good things, but alſo that ſinful be, is good: i. e.</hi> things ſinful are good, not <hi>morally,</hi> but <hi>naturally,</hi> as means utile and conducible to the promoting of Divine glorie: for albeit they oppoſe the bonitie of the creature, yet materially conſidered they oppoſe not the bonitie of the Creator; who can extract the greateſt good out of the greateſt evils. Doth it not then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the infinite bonitie of God, to permit ſins to be? Yea, doth not the ingreſſe of ſin into the world belong to the perfection thereof? is not then the ſubſtrate mater thereof ſome natural good? This is wel demonſtrated by <hi>Suarez, Metaph. Diſput. 11. ſect. 3. p.</hi> 252. <q>Sin as ſin has a material cauſe, which is always ſome good. So <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>That there can be no evil but in good, becauſe if there were pure evil it would deſtroy itſelf:</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe ſin, as to its formal cauſe, is not purely poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,<note place="margin">Abſurdum eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, ſi dicere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ullum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum aut pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum, aut ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum peccatum aut defectum, poſſe per ſe exiſtere, cùm nullum detur ſeparatum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, ſed omne malum ſit in bono, <hi>Strang. de Volunt. l. 3. c. 19. p.</hi> 629.</note> or a pure negation, but a privation of debite perfection, therefore it requires a ſubject unto which ſuch a perfection is due; which ſubject muſt be ſome good, &amp;c.</q> Yea, <hi>Strangius</hi> himſelf, our principal Adverſary in this Controverſie, grants in this particular as much as we demand, <hi>pag. 629. That it is abſurd to ſay, any ſin or defect can exiſt of itſelf, ſithat there can be no ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate evil; but al evil is</hi> [ſeated] <hi>in good.</hi> Yea, he ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, <hi>pag. 245. That hatred of God,</hi> [which is an action intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally evil] <hi>as it is an Act and Being, ſo it is from God, namely as it is hatred.</hi> For, adds he, <hi>So hatred truly, as it is abſtracted from this or that object is a phyſic action, to which the metaphyſic bonitie of</hi> Ens

                        <hi>or Being agrees, and it is morally indifferent; but as it is determined to God, hence is its <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, Obliquitie.</hi> This conceſſion of <hi>Strangius,</hi> if wel conſidered, would not only overthrow his own Antitheſis againſt our Hypotheſis, but alſo put a period to this Controverſie, as in what follows we ſhal demonſtrate, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. §. 1.</p>
                     <p>3. But the principal thing to be examined in the explication of ſin is its <hi>formal Conſtitution</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which we ſhal endeavour to manifeſt in the following Propoſitions. (1) <hi>Al human acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Al Acts in their generic nature indifferent.</note> 
                        <hi>in their generic phyſic Entitie or natural Being, abſtracted from their moral conſtitution, are neither good nor evil, but morally indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</hi> Al moral Beings or Acts are ſcated, <gap reason="foreign">

There is no virtue or vice which has not ſomething of nature for its ſubject and ſeat: it's true, there may be nature where there is no moralitie, yet there cannot be moralitie where there is not ſome nature to ſuſtain the ſame. Now al human nature, as alſo al natural Acts conſidered in their generic natural Idea, albeit capable of virtue or vice, yet are in themſelves morally indifferent. Al thoughts, words and actions conſidered phyſically and abſtractly, without regard to their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral determination by the Wil and Law of God, are neither good nor evil. For Moralitie is a mode not phyſically or intrinſecally inherent in human acts, but appendent to them from the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Divine Law: The very acts of loving and hating God, conſidered in their generic, phyſic and entitative nature, as abſtracted from the moral relation they have to their object, are morally neither good nor evil; becauſe moral Bonitie and Vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie are differences of human acts merely accidental or modal, as <hi>Suarez</hi> and other Scholemen generally grant.

that Platonic notion defended by ſome learned men, <hi>That the reaſons of good and evil are eternal,</hi> is of dangerous conſequence, albeit it hath ſomewhat of Truth (as other errors have) mixed with it: we grant, that in things morally good, there is a <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condecence</hi> or <hi>congruitie</hi> to human nature, even antecedent to the Divine wil and conſtitution. As on ſuppoſition of mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing created, he immediately falls under a neceſſary and eſſential obligation of loving God, hating ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are duties naturally congruous, yea morally neceſſary to human nature. Whence it is, that Divines uſually determine, <hi>That Original Righteouſneſs was natural to Adam,</hi> i. e. moſt condecent, congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and morally neceſſary to his Nature. Yet all this hinders not, but that the formal Determination of al Morals ariſe from the free conſtitution of the Divine wil and Law. The Law of God is the great <hi>Expanſum</hi> or <hi>firmament,</hi> which God has ſpread over the rational world, whereby al Mankind are moderated and regulated in al their moral Acts, and by which they ſhall be at laſt day judged: whence it neceſſarily follows, that al moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution muſt procede hence, as we have more amply demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, <hi>Court Gentiles, P. 4. B. 1. c.</hi> 2. §. 1, 2. Thus alſo <hi>Voetius, Diſput.

                     <p>(3) <hi>The formal reaſon or nature of Sin conſiſts in its being a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, or Tranſgreſſion of the Divine Law.</hi> This Propoſition is fully ſtated and demonſtrated in Sacred Philoſophie, as we have copioſely proved, <hi>Court Gent.</hi> P. 4.

[2] That Sin is not a <hi>mere nothing,</hi> but has ſome kind of <hi>logic poſitivitie</hi> or <hi>notional entitie,</hi> ſo far as to render it capable of being the terme of a Propoſition, as we have more fully ſhewen, <hi>Philoſ. Gen.</hi> P. 1. l. 3. c. 3. S. 4. §. 2. But, [3] We may not yield, that Sin is a moral poſitive Relation, much leſs a poſitive act or real Being, ſuch as is the term of a natural production: For ſuch a perſwaſion wil neceſſarily force men to grant, <hi>that God is the Author of Sin,</hi> or to hold with the Manichees, <hi>that there are two firſt Cauſes, one of good and the other of evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Touching the kinds of ſinful Actions, that which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally concerns our preſent controverſie is the diſtinction of ſinful
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57509:9"/>
Actions, into ſuch as are <hi>modally only,</hi> or ſuch as are <hi>intrinſecally evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(1) By actions <hi>modally evil</hi> they generally underſtand ſuch as are<note place="margin">Actions modally ſinful.</note> ſubſtantially good, yet have ſome modal accidental vitioſitie or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs appendent to them. Such are al the ſincerely pious acts of good men in this imperfect ſtate; which have an evangelic per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and goodneſs in them, yet mixed with much corruption and imperfection. For ſuch is the profunde myſterious wiſdom of God, that he permits a mixture of ſin even with the beſt good works on this ſide Heaven, thereby to render the methods of his Grace the more illuſtrious: ſo that the ſame Act, which is in evangelic eſtimation ſincerely good, is alſo modally ſinful and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. Thus <hi>Strangius,</hi> l. 2. c. 9. p. 205. <hi>Sithat al tranſgreſſion of the Law is ſin, men ſin both by doing what is forbidden, as alſo by doing what is commanded, if not in that manner as commanded: Again, both by not doing what is commanded, as alſo by abſtaining from what is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, if they abſtain not in a regular manner. Thus oft it comes to paſs, that the action may be good according to the ſubſtance of the work, and yet evil as to the mode of acting. As for example; to give Almes to the poor is a work ſubſtantially good, yet if it procede not from Faith and Charitie, and reſpect to the glorie of God, it is evil as to the mode of acting.</hi> Thus <hi>Strangius.</hi> But I adde, that the beſt works of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers are ſubſtantially evil, in that they have nothing of ſincere good in them; but ful of hatred of God; and the beſt works of pious ſouls in this imperfect ſtate are modally evil, becauſe they have a tincture of vitioſitie appendent to them.</p>
                     <p>(2) By Actions <hi>intrinſecally evil,</hi> they generally underſtand<note place="margin">Actions intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecally evil.</note> ſuch as being referred to and determined by ſuch or ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, carrie in them an intrinſec vitioſitie and malignitie; ſo that whiles under ſuch a reference and determination they can never become good. And the commun inſtance is in hatred of God, and Blaſphemie. Not that thoſe acts are in their phyſic material entitie or ſubſtance ſinful, but only in their moral conſtitution and formal determination or reference to their object. Thus much is alſo acknowledged by <hi>Strangius,</hi> l. 1. c. 13. p. 89. <hi>When, according to the commun ſentence, it is ſaid, that ſome alſo are in themſelves or intrinſecally evil, the acts are not underſtood as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from their Object, but as they refer to their object, in regard of which they have their vitioſitie.—It ſeems to me, that the vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, which is in the hatred of God, doth not belong to the material,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57509:10"/>
but formal of Sin.</hi> Which is an ingenuous confeſſion, and wil be of much uſe to us in what follows. At preſent we ſhall only remarque; that this notion of <hi>Acts intrinſecally evil,</hi> if duely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, wil be of no uſe to our Opponents, albeit they ſeem to lay the moſt ſtreſs on it. For [1] They grant, as <hi>Strangius</hi> here, <hi>that the vitioſitie, which is in the hatred of God</hi> [and ſo in all other acts intrinſecally evil] <hi>doth not belong to the material but formal of ſin:</hi> ſo that Gods concurſe to the material or ſubſtrate mater of ſin doth not ſuppoſe his concurſe to the formal obliquitie of ſin. [2] In acts <hi>ſincerely</hi> but <hi>imperfectly good,</hi> and <hi>modally evil,</hi> the ſubſtrate mater or material act, which is both good and evil, is one and the ſame: now our Adverſaries grant Predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the material act as good: how then can they denie predetermination to the ſame material entitative act which is evil, though not as ſuch? But of this more hereafter, <hi>c.</hi> 5.</p>

                        <hi>Freedom,</hi> or <hi>Libertie of the Wil;</hi> which is indeed the hinge on which our whole controverſie turns, as our more intelligent Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents confeſs. A reverend Divine, <hi>Cathol.

I do readily concur with him in this, <hi>That the ſum of al the controveſie muſt be reſolved into this notion of free-wil;</hi> and therefore if we cannot make good our ground here, we muſt neceſſarily fal under the efforts of our Antagoniſts. And I muſt confeſs this conception has been deeply engraven on my thoughts, for twenty five years or more, that the whole of the Pelagian and Arminian contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie centers in this point, touching the <hi>Libertie of the Wil:</hi> and he that endeavours to remove thoſe maladies, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks thoſe Pelagian infuſions that lie hid in the heart of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, doth act but like the unskilful Phyſician, who, to <hi>remove an Hectick Feaver, endeavoured to cure the Itch.</hi> What made <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus</hi> drive Gods immediate Concurſe to human acts, but this perſwaſion, that it deſtroyeth the Libertie of the wil, and ſo makes God the Author of ſin? And what makes the Jeſuites de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Predetermination, but the like groundleſs perſwaſion? So alſo <hi>Baronius,</hi> in his <hi>Metaphyſics, Sect. 8. Diſp. 3. §. 79. p.</hi> 147. Here it was that the Pelagians of old took Sanctuarie, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of this terme <hi>Free-wil</hi> conceled al their venimous Infuſions: here, by their ſophiſtic logic and ambiguous cloudy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57509:10"/>
diſtinctions, they fortified themſelves againſt the Defenders of Efficacious Grace. Thus <hi>Janſenius, Auguſt. de Natur. Lapſ.</hi> Tom. 2. l. 4. c. 24. proves largely out of <hi>Auguſtine, that the principal fraud and cheat of the Pelagians lay in their philoſophic hallucination about natural free-wil, which they placed</hi> in <hi>Indifference,</hi> but <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> in <hi>a rational ſpontaneitie.</hi> Herein they are followed by the Jeſuites and Arminians, who indeed differ not ſcarcely one hairs breadth from the Pelagians and Semi-pelagians. Yea <hi>Baronius,</hi> (whom <hi>Rutherford</hi> rangeth among the Arminians) with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence maintains <hi>Bellarmines</hi> definition of Libertie, as juſtifiable and orthodoxe, <hi>Metaphyſ.</hi> Sect. 12. p. 285.</p>
                     <p>But other of our Antagoniſts, <hi>Strangius, Le Blanc,</hi> &amp;c. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving<note place="margin">The new coined diſtinction of Libertie largely and ſtrictly taken.</note> that our Reformed Divines have generally placed Natural Libertie in a <hi>Rational Spontaneity,</hi> and ſo preſumed, <hi>that volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary neceſſitie is very wel conſiſtent therewith,</hi> hence they have found out an artificial diſtinction for the reconciling the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> with the <hi>Jeſuites, Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Arminians:</hi> They diſtinguiſh Libertie, into <hi>that which is largely, or ſtrictly taken:</hi> and they confeſs, (1) That Libertie taken <hi>largely,</hi> as it is a perfection of the Soul, ſo it has one and the ſame notion with <hi>Rational Spontaneitie;</hi> and ſuch is the Libertie of glorified Souls. This Libertie they make eſſential to the wil; of which ſee <hi>Strangius, l. 3. c. 14. p.</hi> 686. alſo <hi>p.</hi> 691, 702, 703. But, adde they, (2) There is alſo a <hi>libertie ſtrictly</hi> ſo termed, which conſiſts in the Indifference of the wil to this or that object, alſo to act or not to act: and this Libertie is moſt proper to this our imperfect ſtate, as <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> p. 188. 687. 689. 711. So likewiſe <hi>Le Blanc,</hi> p. 435. and others. There were ſome firſt lines of this diſtinction drawn by <hi>Camero,</hi> who makes libertie ſtrictly ſo termed to be about the <hi>means,</hi> not the <hi>end;</hi> yet his Notions about Libertie are tolerable, in that he makes Divine Predetermination conſiſtent with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Libertie. But the firſt creator of this diſtinction touching a <hi>two-fold Libertie,</hi> among thoſe who owned the <hi>Synod of Dort,</hi> was <hi>Strangius,</hi> who aſſerts a two-fold Libertie, one conſidered in <hi>its own Nature,</hi> which is eſſential to the wil, and the other as <hi>limited to lapſed man,</hi> which includes <hi>Indifference,</hi> &amp;c. as in places above cited.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57509:11"/>
among the ancient Philoſophers, Primitive Fathers, Scholaſtic Theologues, or any other but theſe new Methodiſts or their Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Do any of the Greek Philoſophers make mention of any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, but what is eſſential to the wil and al human acts? Can we find among the Greek Theologues any notices of this two-fold Libertie? Yea do not the very Jeſuites herein concur with us, that Liberty is eſſential to al moral acts, both in the future, as wel as the preſent ſtate of the Soul? Is not Libertie conſtituted by them and the Arminians as the foundation of al Moralitie? Doth not <hi>Amyraldus, de Libero Arbitrio,</hi> as wel as we, make Libertie properly taken eſſential to the wil and al its Acts? Of what uſe then can this diſtinction of a two-fold Libertie be? Wil it ſatisfie the Pelagians, Jeſuites or Arminians? No; becauſe they al make Libertie ſtrictly taken eſſential to al Moral Acts. Or, wil it any way relieve the Calviniſts in their conflicts both with Jeſuites and Arminians, to ſay the wil is ſometimes free and ſometimes not? If it be ſuppoſed, that Indifference be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to libertie in this imperfect ſtate, wil it not then be replied by Pelagians and Arminians, that the wil is not, according to theſe new Methodiſts, free in Converſion, becauſe not indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent?

Soul, or violation to natural Libertie. It's true, that Moral Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, conſiſting in virtuoſe Habits, Inclinations and Exercices, is the Perfection of Man, yet ſo as the Eſſence of the Soul is not diminiſhed or deſtroyed by the loſs thereof.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Our firſt Parents in their innocent ſtate were inveſted not only with natural but alſo with moral Libertie or free-wil to good.</hi> This is granted on both ſides, and therefore needs not further demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Since the fal corrupt Nature in its unregenerate ſtate lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a total, univerſal and naturally moral Impotence as to al Moral and ſpiritual good.</hi> I cal this Impotence <hi>total and univerſal,</hi> as it overſpreads the whole ſoul, and has ſtript it of al ſeeds of, or inclinations to, any ſpiritual or truely moral good. I terme it alſo <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>naturally moral,</hi> in that, albeit the ſubject be moral, yet the Impotence being communicated together with corrupt Nature, connatural or congenite and proper thereto, as corrupt, and as to al natural power inſeparable therefrom, it is become a <hi>moral Nature.</hi> I am not ignorant, that ſome new Methodiſts, together with the Arminians, ſtiffely contend, <hi>that this Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is not natural but only moral;</hi> but either they intend under the ambiguitie of the termes to concele ſome Pelagian Infuſions of natural ſeeds of virtue and Free-wil to Moral good, or elſe they muſt wreſt the termes Moral and Natural from their native ſenſe, and what is intended by thoſe that defend a natural impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. For al know, that by <hi>moral Impotence</hi> is generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood an <hi>Impotence contracted</hi> by frequent Acts of and Cuſtom in Sin; and ſo on the contrary by natural Impotence is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſuch as is traduced together with, and through the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable contagion of ſin inſeparably appendent to corrupt nature. Of this ſee more <hi>Philoſoph. General. P. 1. L. 3. c. 3. S.</hi> 5. §. 1. Hence,</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Sin in corrupt Nature becomes neceſſary, and the obſervation of Divine Precepts impoſſible.</hi> This Propoſition has ever been in al Ages of the Church, the great bal of contention between the Patrons of Free-wil, and the Defenſors of Free-grace. The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians of old as the Arminians of late have made this their main Refuge for the defenſe of their <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Free-wil. If Sin,</hi> ſay they, <hi>be neceſſary, and ſo inevitable, then it ceaſeth to be ſin: if it be voluntary, then it may be avoided.</hi> But theſe Pelagian Armes <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and his Sectators have ſtoutly refelled, by ſhewing,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57509:12"/>
(1) That the Law was not originally impoſſible to mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only is become ſo accidentally by reaſon of Sin, and the impotence of corrupt Nature. (2) That this Impotence is not leſs voluntary than neceſſary, yea the more neceſſary it is, the more voluntary: The neceſſitie of this Impotence is ſeated in and ariſeth from the Wil, and therefore moſt voluntary. Thence <hi>Auguſtin</hi> termes it <hi>dura Neceſſitas, an hard Neceſſitie,</hi> becauſe the more neceſſary this impotence is the more voluntary, and the more voluntary it is the more neceſſary. <hi>Plato, Phileb. p.</hi> 22. gives it the character, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57509:13"/>
contradiction comes not within the compaſs of poſſible, becauſe contradictions have no paſſive power of being verified; for the affirming of the one is the denying of the other; the truth of the one makes the other falſe: But whatever implies not a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or repugnance of exiſting, that <hi>may be;</hi> and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>ſimply</hi> and <hi>abſolutely impoſſible,</hi> of which ſee <hi>Court Gent. P. 4. B. 2. c.</hi> 5. § 4. Now that the Concurſe of God predetermining the wil to the ſubſtrate mater of ſinful acts cannot render the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite act of obedience ſimply and abſolutely impoſſible is evident; becauſe (1) the oppoſite act of obedience implies no contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or repugnance of exiſting: For God can and doth work it in ſome: albeit it be in a limited ſenſe impoſſible to corrupt nature, yet it is poſſible to Grace, as before. (2) The wil predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to one act has an habitual indifference or radical flexibilitie to the oppoſite act; and therefore the impoſſibilitie is only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionate and limited. A reverend Divine ſuppoſeth, <hi>That Gods determinative concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin leaves it undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the mater of al his Laws, in reference to al ſuch actions, are a ſimple and moſt ſtrictly natural impoſſibilitie.</hi> Which I conceive to be a great miſtake, and that according to the confeſſion of our principal Adverſary, <hi>Strangius,</hi> who <hi>lib. 3. cap. 8. pag.</hi> 625. ſpeaks thus: <hi>Therefore the Divine determination either by efficacious grace, or any other way</hi> [which includes concurſe to the entitative act of ſin] <hi>being granted, there is truly inferred a neceſſitie of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; becauſe that act of the wil unto which it is determined by God muſt neceſſarily follow, but it is not a neceſſitie of the conſequent, which in its own nature remains contingent; and therefore in a compoſite ſenſe the wil, when it is determined by God to act, cannot but act. Whence ſome Scholemen ſay, That in free-wil there is a ſimultie of power to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In libero arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio eſt ſimul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas potentiae ad oppoſita, ſed non potentia ſimultatis, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez.</hi>

                        <hi>but not a power of ſimultie,</hi> i. e. <hi>a power of embracing oppoſites at one and the ſame time: whereof the reaſon is this, becauſe a power to one act is not oppoſed to the power unto the negation of the ſame act, or to a contrary act, but two contraries or contradictories cannot be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame ſubject. Of which mater</hi> Alvarez <hi>diſcourſeth lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, de Auxil. l. 9. Diſp. 94. &amp; l. 12. Diſp.</hi> 115. Note wel here, that <hi>Strangius</hi> in this point fals in with the Dominicans, and fully aſſents and conſents to their mode of conciliating Divine determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with human libertie, which if the fore-mentioned reverend Brother and others would do, I ſhould judge our Controverſie ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near, if not fully at an end. The ſum of al is this, That the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57509:13"/>
or predetermination of Divine concurſe to this or that act doth not make the negation of that act, or a contrary act <hi>a ſimple</hi> or <hi>moſt ſtrictly natural impoſſibilitie,</hi> as ſome would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us, but only infers a neceſſitie of the conſequence, the wil having ſtil, <hi>in ſenſu diviſo, i. e.</hi> on ſuppoſition of the withdrawment of Divine concurſe, an habitual indifference to act or not to act, though, <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> as predetermined by Divine concurſe, it cannot but act. Or ſummarily thus: The wil has at that very time, when it is predetermined by God to this or that act, an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual power or radical indifference to the negation of that act, or to the putting forth a contrary act: So that Divine predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion excludes only a contrary act, not the radical power to that act. Thus alſo <hi>Davenant, Animadv.</hi> againſt <hi>Hoard, p.</hi> 240, 333, 341, 360, 402. proves ſtrongly and accurately, <hi>That abſolute Election and Reprobation may ſtand with a poſſibilitie to contrary events, though not with contrary events.</hi> Of which more hereafter.</p>

                     <p>This diſtribution of the Divine wil is greatly oppoſed by the Pelagians, Arminians, and new Methodiſts. (1) The Jeſuites, whom we may without breach of charitie terme Pelagians, do what they can to baffle this diſtinction: ſo <hi>Molina,</hi> the Head of that Faction, <hi>in Thom. Part. 1. Quaeſt. 19. Art.</hi> 12. tels us, <hi>That theſe ſigns of the Divine wil ſignifie properly and formally ſome nolition or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition in God;</hi> and therefore Gods ſignificative wil cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinguiſht to his beneplacite wil. The ſame is urged by the Arminians. But the Orthodox both among Papiſts and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants replie, that Gods reveled ſignificative wil is only <hi>equivocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, analogically, figuratively</hi> and <hi>improperly</hi> termed his wil, as the Edicts of Princes, and Laws of States. So <hi>Sanderſon de Obligatione Conſcientiae, Praelect. 4 ſect.</hi> 20. tels us, <hi>That Gods beneplacite wil is that whereby God has from al Eternitie conſtituted with himſelf what he wil do: his ſignificative wil is that whereby he has appointed unto us a Law, by ſignifying what he wil have done by us. Whereof the former is properly and univocally the wil of God, but this later improperly and analogically ſo called.</hi> The like <hi>Davenant, Animadverſ. pag.</hi> 392. It's true, Divines grant, that this ſignificative wil of God has ſome Decree or Act of the beneplacite wil anſwering thereto: for the wiſe God decreed, that this or that ſhould be mans dutie; but they denie that this reveled wil of God touching mans dutie is the ſame with his decretive wil touching events. (2) Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries pretend, that by this diſtinction of the <hi>ſignificative and beneplacite wil</hi> we make two oppoſite wils in God, and ſuch as claſh each with other. This makes a reverend Brother to reject this diſtinction, as of no uſe in our preſent caſe. But Divines anſwer, that theſe wils are not <hi>oppoſite</hi> in God, but only <hi>diſparate</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe:</hi> the things decreed, and the things reveled and conſtituted by Gods ſignificative wil may oppoſe each other, but the decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and reveled wil never oppoſe each other. The moſt holy and wiſe God really intends whatever he commands, or approves, with an intention that it ſhal be mans dutie, and rewarded if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57509:14"/>
but not alwayes with an intention that it ſhal be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. (3) Our Opponents, and particularly the new Methodiſts, confound Gods <hi>Beneplacite Decretive</hi> Wil, with his <hi>Wil of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence and Approbation:</hi> and under this confuſion endeavor to ſecure their oppoſition againſt Gods willing the Permiſſion of Sin. Thus <hi>Strangius,</hi> l. 3. c. 2. p. 548. <hi>None can be ſaid to wil what he doth not approve.</hi> Thence others make Love of compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence eſſential to al acts of the Divine Wil: and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, if God wil the permiſſion of Sin, he muſt neceſſarily take complacence therein. But the replie hereto is not difficult: we ſay, that God takes complacence in al his own Acts, but not in al the objects they refer unto: but now love of complacence is not ſo termed from the act, but object about which it is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; which muſt be ſome good either natural or moral. Whence it is evident, that God may wil the permiſſion of Sin, and its exiſtence as a conſequent thereto, and yet not take complacence in or approve of ſin.

Thence, (2) the terme <hi>Influxe</hi> is abſolute, not denoting the reſpect of any other cauſe, but that of concurſe is relative. I have no mind to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel about termes without juſt ground, and therefore can eaſily admit this diſtinction, though it make neither for nor againſt either party. But that which more immediately concerns our<note place="margin">Immediate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe what.</note> preſent controverſie is, 1. To give the true Idea and Notion of <hi>Immediate Concurſe,</hi> as generally aſſerted and ſtated in the Scholes: which we ſhal endeavour to explicate both negatively and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</p>
                     <p>(1) Negatively, <hi>Immediate concurſe to an Act conſiſtes not in the preſervation of the principe, or rendring of it apt and habile for any congenerous action.</hi> I know a learned and pious Divine, who ſeems in termes to grant immediate Concurſe as to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate mater of ſinful actions, yet in the cloſe placeth it only in this, <hi>That God as the firſt Mover, ſo far excite and actuate thoſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57509:15"/>
powers, as that they are apt and habile for any congenerous action, to which they have a natural deſignation; and whereunto they are not ſinfully diſinclined.</hi> But al this, as I conceive, no way reacheth the true notion of Immediate concurſe, neither is it conſiſtent with it ſelf. For, [1] If <hi>God as the firſt mover excite and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate thoſe powers,</hi> then are they neceſſarily by him drawn or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to act, which is more than being <hi>apt and habile for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous action:</hi> certainly to excite and actuate a power is more than to render it apt and habile for an action. [2] If the Powers by Gods <hi>exciting</hi> of them are rendred only <hi>apt and habile</hi> for any congenerous action, then where is immediate concurſe as to the Act? Did or would any terme this immediate concurſe, <hi>ſo far to excite and actuate thoſe powers, as that they are apt and habile for any congenerous Action?</hi> [3] What this <hi>Aptitude</hi> and <hi>Habilitie</hi> is, which the Powers receive by being thus excited and actuated by God, I cannot divine: Are not the powers of the ſoul as powers <hi>apt</hi> and <hi>habile</hi> for natural actions, ſuch as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate mater of ſin is? What other <hi>Aptitude</hi> or <hi>Habilitie</hi> doth God give unto the natural faculties as to ſinful acts, but merely the facultie of acting? Need ſinners any other facultie, power, Apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or Habilitie to ſin, but the rational faculties depraved? It's true, God applies thoſe faculties to the entitative act of that which is ſinful, but yet doth not adde any aptitude or habilitie to ſin. [4] Doth not <hi>Durandus</hi> and his Sectators grant al this, and yet denie immediate concurſe as to the entitative act of ſin? The Hypotheſis of <hi>Durandus</hi> doth no way exclude any kind of <hi>Aptitude</hi> or <hi>Habilitie,</hi> but rather include the ſame; it only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the immediate application of the power to its act; which alſo is excluded by this laxe notion of Immediate concurſe. [5] Laſtly, if they who oppoſe Gods concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of al ſinful acts, do indeed and in truth aſſert and owne an immediate concurſe to any one entitative act that is ſinful, al thoſe black and direful conſequences, which they caſt on the aſſertors of Predetermination, may with as much facilitie be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted on them, as we ſhal demonſtrate, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. §. 4. Hence,</p>
                     <p>(2) Affirmatively, <hi>Immediate concurſe as to its formal Idea not only gives an Aptitude or Habilitie to act, but alſo immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the very act it ſelf.</hi> That this notion of immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe is univerſally received in the Scholes, is moſt evident.

                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:57509:17"/>We now procede to examine this notion as uſed by ſcholaſtic<note place="margin">Predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Concurſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</note> Theologues, and how far their ſentiments thereof are applicable to our preſent Controverſie. (1) Some diſtinguiſh between Gods <hi>predefinition</hi> and his <hi>predetermination:</hi> his <hi>predefinition</hi> they reſtrain to his Decrees, and his <hi>predetermination</hi> to his Concurſe. Others diſtinguiſh the predetermination of God into <hi>extrinſec</hi> and <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſec:</hi> by <hi>extrinſec predetermination</hi> they underſtand the act of the Divine Wil or Decree, whereby the creature is predetermined to act: by <hi>intrinſec predetermination</hi> they mean the <hi>previous motion</hi> of God upon the creature, which continually moves and applies it to act. But I ſhould rather diſtinguiſh predetermination, (as Creation and al other Acts of God <hi>ad extrà</hi>) into <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive:</hi> [1] By <hi>active predetermination</hi> I mean nothing elſe but the Act or Decree of the Divine wil, whereby al ſecond cauſes, perſons, acts, effects and things receive their termes, order, and limitation as to power and activitie. This is the ſame with predefinition, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, and extrinſec predetermination. That this active predetermination procedes only from the efficacious previous act of the Divine wil, without any impreſſion or actual influxe on the ſecond cauſe has been defended by <hi>Scotus</hi> and others of great name in the Scholes, and that on invict reaſons: for if God wil, that the ſecond cauſe, (ſuppoſe it be the human wil) act, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on the volition of God the action of the ſecond cauſe wil follow, not from any previous impreſſion on the ſecond cauſe, but from its natural ſubordination and as it were ſympathie with the firſt cauſe: as at the beck of the human wil every inferior facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of man moves. See <hi>Suarez, de Auxil. l. 1. c. 5. n.</hi> 3. and <hi>Court Gent. P. 4. B. 2. c.</hi> 7. §. 3. [2] By <hi>paſſive predetermination</hi> I underſtand the concurſe of God as applying the ſecond cauſe to its act, and not <hi>really,</hi> but <hi>mentally</hi> or <hi>modally</hi> only diſtinct therefrom: For as <hi>active</hi> predetermination is the ſame with the Divine wil, ſo <hi>paſſive</hi> predetermination is the ſame with the ſecond cauſe, its act and effect, as we have demonſtrated <hi>Court Gent. P. 4. B. 2. c.</hi> 8. §. 1.</p>
                     <p>(2) Predetermination is uſually diſtinguiſhed into <hi>phyſic</hi> or <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Predeterminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on phyſic and moral.</note> and <hi>ethic</hi> or <hi>moral.</hi> This diſtinction dependes on that of cauſes into <hi>phyſic,</hi> and <hi>moral:</hi> a <hi>phyſic</hi> or <hi>natural cauſe</hi> is that which is truly efficient, and ſo doth really influence the act and effect, in a way of proper efficience or cauſalitie: whence an <hi>Ethic</hi> or <hi>moral cauſe</hi> is that which doth not immediately, directly, or in a way of real proper efficience produce the act and effect, but only <hi>morally,</hi>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57509:18"/>
by propoſing objects, motives, precepts, promiſſes, or the like moral means and influences, with excitements and perſuaſions. Thus proportionably we may diſtinguiſh predetermination into <hi>phyſic</hi> and <hi>moral.</hi> [1] By <hi>phyſic predetermination</hi> we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not corporal, or natural in a ſtrict notion, which is proper only to things inaminate or Brutes, but ſuch a predetermination as really applies the Agent or ſecond cauſe to its act, and really, yea immediately influenceth both act and effect. Thus <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez, Metaphyſ. Diſput. 17. ſect. 2. num. 2. A phyſic cauſe [and ſo predetermination] in this place is not taken for a corporal or natural cauſe, acting by corporeous and material motion; but it's taken more univerſally, for a cauſe that truly and really influenceth the effect: for as nature ſometimes ſignifies any eſſence; ſo phyſic or natural influxe is that which by true and proper cauſalitie worketh the effect: to which when a moral cauſe is oppoſed, it is to be underſtood of ſuch a cauſe which doth not of itſelf and truly act, yet it doth ſo carrie itſelf, as that the effect may be imputed to it: ſuch a cauſe is he that comforts, beſeecheth, or hinders not when he may and ought.</hi> Hence [2] by <hi>moral predetermination,</hi> as it regardes Gods influence on the moral rational world, we muſt underſtand his moral influence on man as his laſt end, his ſtating mans dutie by moral precepts, inviting thereto by Evangelic promiſſes, dehorting from ſin by penal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and al other moral influences. Here we are to note, that albeit phyſic and moral predetermination be comprehended under phyſic and moral cauſalitie, yet the later is more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive than the former: for phyſic predetermination properly belongs to a ſuperior cauſe as acting on an inferior, but phyſic cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalitie to any efficient, as <hi>Strangius</hi> doth wel obſerve.</p>
                     <p>But to ſum up the whole, both the Dominicans and Calviniſts agree with the Jeſuites and Arminians in this, That the holy God doth not <hi>morally</hi> predetermine any to ſin: for he neither counſels, encourageth, commandes, or invites any one to the leaſt ſin. The Queſtion therefore muſt be underſtood of <hi>phyſic predetermination;</hi> which I ſhal deſcribe according to the explication of <hi>Strangius, l. 2. c. 4. p.</hi> 159. thus: <q>By the phyſic predetermination of God in this place is underſtood the action of God, whereby he moves and applies the ſecond cauſe to act, and ſo antecedently to al operation of the creature; or in order of nature and reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the creature workes, God really and efficaciouſly moves it to act in al its actions: <hi>i. e.</hi> he actes and cauſeth, that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57509:18"/>
actes and cauſeth whatever it actes and cauſeth: ſo that without this premotion of God the creature can do nothing: and this premotion being given it is impoſſible, in a compoſite ſenſe, that the creature ſhould not act and do that, unto which it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the firſt cauſe.</q> And more particularly, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, as for Gods predetermination of the human wil, <hi>Strangius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Praedetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem eſt appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ad agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, &amp; facere ut faciat, <hi>Strang.</hi>

                        <hi>l. 2. c. 11. p.</hi> 244. gives it us thus: <hi>To predetermine the wil, as they teach, is to applie the wil to act, and to make it act.</hi> Which deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of predetermination I do readily cloſe with, and ſo the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before us wil be ſummarily this,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whether God doth by an efficacious power and influence move and predetermine men unto al their natural actions, even thoſe that have ſin annexed or appendent to them?</hi> Affirm.</p>
                     <p>I am not ignorant, that a reverend and learned Divine who oppoſeth our Hypotheſis, ſtates the queſtion otherwiſe, as if we held, <hi>That God doth by an efficacious influence univerſaelly move and determine men to al their actions; even thoſe that are most wicked.</hi> But this Hypotheſis, as propoſed and intended, I know no ſober mind but abhors: whoever ſaid, that God determines men to the moſt wicked actions as ſuch? were not this to make him the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſin, which every pious ſoul deteſtes? For to determine to wicked actions as ſuch, implies alſo a determination to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe of thoſe actions: and this determination cannot be phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic; becauſe ſin as ſin has no phyſic cauſe or determination: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be moral: and ſurely whoever determines morally to the moſt wicked actions cannot but be the moral cauſe, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them: and is not this an high piece of blaſphemie? We are ſo far from aſſerting, that God determines men to the moſt wicked actions, as that we ſay, he determines men to no wicked action; no not the leaſt: Yea we adde further, that in actions ſincerely but imperfectly good, and in part ſinful, albeit God predetermines men both naturally and morally to the goodneſſe of the action, and naturally to the ſubſtrate mater or natural act, yet he predetermines not to the vitioſitie of the act, or the act as ſinful. So the ſum and whole of our Hypotheſis is this, <hi>That God doth by an efficacious power and influence move and predetermine men unto al their natural actions, even ſuch as have ſin appendent to them.</hi> This Hypotheſis we no way doubt but to make good both by ſcriptural and rational demonſtration.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>(1) Ten general Propoſitions wherein the New Methodiſts and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinants agree. (2) The New Methodiſts differences among themſelves about Preſcience, Futurition, Divine Concurſe, and Gods permiſſion of ſin. (3) The differences of the Predeterminants from the New Methodiſts about abſolute Decrees, the Futurition, Divine Permiſſion, Preſcience, Providence, Predefinition, and Predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sin.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE prolixitie we have uſed in explicating and ſtating our Queſtion wil render our ſubſequent work more facile and conciſe. For here that old Proverbe holds true, <hi>A good beginning is half the work.</hi> But before we enter on the Demonſtration of our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> it wil be neceſſary to manifeſt, (1) <hi>Wherein we and thoſe who maintain the Antitheſis do agree. (2) Wherein our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, who maintain the Antitheſis, differ among themſelves. (3) Wherein we differ from them.</hi> The explication of theſe Particulars wil not a little conduce to the more perfect ſtate and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>§. 1. <hi>Wherein we and our Opponents, who maintain the Antitheſis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wherein we and our Opponents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</note> 
                        <hi>do agree.</hi> Some there are who conceive our differences greater than they are; others on the contrary make them leſſe: our firſt work therefore wil be to ſhew, <hi>wherein we agree;</hi> which I ſhal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to lay down in the following Propoſitions.</p>
                     <p>1. Prop. <hi>That God hath decreed althings that come to paſſe.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Adverſaries generally concord with us; albeit they differ from us, as alſo among themſelves about the manner how God decrees the ſubſtrate mater of ſin. Thus <hi>Strangius, l. 3. c. 3. p.</hi> 558. <q>But alſo we confeſſe and ſay, that God doth truly decree al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things that happen, but not althings in one and the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but ſome things <hi>effectively,</hi> other things <hi>permiſſively:</hi> which is the commun opinion of Theologues, according to that famoſe Axiome of <hi>Augustin: There is nothing done, which the Omnipotent doth not wil, either by permitting that it be done, or by doing of it.</hi>
                        </q> Yet the ſaid <hi>Strangius,</hi> in what precedes, gives us a very dangerous poſition touching the Divine Decrees: <q>It is not needful, ſaith
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57509:19"/>
he, that we appoint ſo many particular Decrees of God, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Concurſe to be afforded, as there are actions of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and particular objects of them. Sithat that one general Decree or Inſtitute of God may ſuffice, whereby he hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to concur with al the actions of the creature, as he hath given them a power to act, &amp;c.</q> This general Decree, foiſted in to ſalve his own Hypotheſis, is moſt unworthy of the Divine Being, in that it overthrows the Preſcience of God, impoſeth imperfection on the Divine Wil, and opens an effectual dore to Pelagianiſme.</p>
                     <p>2. Prop. <hi>That Election of ſome to Grace and Glorie is abſolute, and no way dependent on the previſion of any act of man.</hi> This Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although it be denied by the Pelagians, Socinians, and Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, yet it is generally granted by our Adverſaries, the New Methodiſts, <hi>Amyraldus, Strangius, Le Blanc,</hi> and others. For theſe, albeit they make Reprobation conditional and dependent on mans ſin, yet they grant a particular abſolute Election of ſome to Grace and Glorie: which to me ſeems very ſtrange and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their Hypotheſis about Reprobation: For if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God be abſolute as to Election, why ſhould they not be<note place="margin">Volitiones pure conditionales ſunt alienae à ſapientia &amp; prudentia Dei, <hi>Ruiz. de Volunt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dei, Diſp.</hi> 20. §. 1.</note> alſo eſtimed ſuch as to Reprobation? Can the Divine wil be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by any thing but itſelf? Are not conditional Decrees incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent therewith? Doth not God in the glaſs of his own Decrees foreſee al acts and events of the human wil? Muſt they not then be al decreed abſolutely by God? See hereafter, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 3.</p>
                     <p>3. Prop. <hi>That God hath a certain Science or Preſcience of ſin, as wel as of al other Events.</hi> This Propoſition is univerſally granted by al the New Methodiſts, <hi>Amyraldus, Strangius,</hi> &amp;c. as alſo by moſt Arminians, although it be utterly incompoſſible and inconſiſtent with the ſentiments both of the one and t'other Partie. For al the wit of man, yea I wil with confidence adde of Devils, wil never be able to explicate and demonſtrate a certain preſcience in God of things future, but what is originated in and dependent on his own Decrees. I muſt ſolemnely profeſſe, I can ſee no way left to evade the force of <hi>Socinus</hi>'s argument againſt the certaintie of Gods preſcience, if we reſolve it not into the free determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own wil decreeing al future events: of which more in what follows, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 2.</p>
                     <p>4. Prop. <hi>That whatever God abſolutely predefines or predeſtines from Eternitie, he predetermines in time.</hi> This Propoſition the New-Methodiſts
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57509:20"/>
ſeem generally to grant. So <hi>Strangius, l. 3. c. 2. p.</hi> 547. <q>When we ſpeak of abſolute predefinition, we willingly grant, that the predefinition of God from eternitie, and the Predetermination of the create wil in time mutually follow each other; ſo that whatever particular ſingular Act God hath ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely predefined ſhould be done by us, to the ſame he doth determine our wil: For whatever God hath by his Decree ſo predefined, it is neceſſary that he effect the ſame, or cauſe that it be done; becauſe the Decree of God, ſeeing it is abſolute and efficacious, muſt neceſſarily have its effect; which it cannot have but by efficaciouſly applying the create wil to the predefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite act: otherwiſe, if the wil ſhould not act that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defined, the Predefinition and Decree of God would be fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is abſurd.</q> A good conceſſion, which wil be of uſe to us in what follows, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 3.</p>
                     <p>5. Prop. <hi>That God doth predetermine the human Wil to al acts and effects morally good, as alſo to ſome other commun acts and effects.</hi> This Propoſition is generally rejected by the Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as alſo by <hi>Baronius,</hi> yet the New Methodiſts, who have chalked out a middle Way, generally entertain it. Thus <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, l. 3. c. 5. p.</hi> 584. <q>We have ſhewen, that God doth not in al things predetermine the human Wil, namely not in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons intrinſecally evil, and to which Vitioſitie is neceſſarily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed; albeit in things lawful, not only in works of Grace, but alſo in others that are commun, according to his own pleaſure, he determines it, with the preſervation of its own native li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, ſithat he can never offer any violence to the wil, but only moves it ſweetly according to its own nature.</q> See more on this argument in what follows, <hi>c.</hi> 3. §. 1. on <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 1. This great conceſſion of <hi>Strangius</hi> indeed cuts the nerves and ſinews of al his arguments againſt our Hypotheſis: For if God can and doth predetermine the wil to ſome acts, without any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered to its Libertie, why may he not alſo predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it to al its acts, without prejudice to its Libertie? The force of this conſequence is ſo ſtrong, that it forceth <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and the Arminians to denie al Predetermination. See <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 4.</p>
                     <p>6. Prop. <hi>That God predetermins the Wil to the ſubſtrate mater of ſome ſinful acts, even of ſuch as are not intrinſecally evil.</hi> This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is granted by <hi>Strangius, l. 4. c. 1. p.</hi> 766. <q>But although
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57509:20"/>
in the actions of wicked men, when God doth uſe them as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for the execution of ſome peculiar works, it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure be ſaid, that God doth determine their wils, yet it ſeems more incommode to ſay, that God moves and predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines to al other acts, as to acts of hatred of God, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> So that he yieldeth, that God may predetermine to the mater of ſome ſinful acts: and indeed it cannot be rationally denied; ſithat Acts imperfectly good are alſo in part ſinful; and the ſubſtrate mater of the act as good and ſinful is the ſame: wherefore if God predetermine the human wil to the ſubſtrate mater of the act as good, muſt he not alſo predetermine it to the ſubſtrate mater of the act as ſinful? When I ſay, that God doth predetermine the wil to the ſubſtrate mater of the act as ſinful, <hi>As</hi> here muſt not, yea cannot be taken <hi>Reduplicatively,</hi> but only <hi>Specificatively,</hi> as it ſpecifies one and the ſame Act, and diſtributes it into its oppoſite Adjuncts of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil:</hi> So that the meaning is no more than this, <hi>that God predetermines the wil to the ſubſtrate mater or entitative act which is both good and evil:</hi> and if he predetermine the wil to the ſubſtrate mater of the Act which is imperfectly good, (as our Adverſaries grant) he muſt alſo neceſſarily predetermine the wil to the ſubſtrate mater of the act whereunto ſin is annexed: becauſe the ſubſtrate mater of the Act as good and evil is the ſame. When our Adverſaries ſhal have given us a rational and diſtinct ſolution to this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhal confeſs they have done much for the ſubverſion of our Hypotheſis. Of this Argument, ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 4, 5.</p>
                     <p>7. Prop. <hi>That there is no real poſitive Act or Entitie in nature, whereof God is not the efficient cauſe.</hi> This is generally granted by al thoſe that denie ſin to be a poſitive Being. So <hi>Strangius, l. 3. c. 3. p.</hi> 557. <q>There is no Entitie, and no action as it is an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or has any realitie, whereof God is not the cauſe, or which he hath not decreed either abſolutely or reſpectively.</q> So <hi>l. 4. c. 11. p.</hi> 859. <q>The entitie of the Action is reduced unto God, as the firſt cauſe, on whoſe concurſe and influxe it dependes. So a Reverend Divine, <hi>Cathol. Theol. Part 1. Sect. 17. p.</hi> 85. `It is certain, that as <hi>motus vel actio</hi> is <hi>quid naturale,</hi> it is of God as the firſt cauſe of Nature: and ſo when a ſinner acteth, it is not without the firſt Univerſal Cauſe.</q> One would think that this conceſſion, if well ſtated and proſecuted, would put an end to our controverſie: For al that we demand is, that the real poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57509:21"/>
act, whereunto ſin is annexed, be from God as the firſt cauſe of Nature: But yet what our Opponents grant, as limited by them wil not anſwer our expectations. For ſome hold with <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus,</hi> that the action is from God, but not immediately; others, that it is immediately from God, yet not by a predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native concurſe. Hence,</p>
                     <p>8. Prop. <hi>That God concurs immediately to the ſubſtrate mater or entitative act whereunto ſin is annexed.</hi> This Propoſition is not granted by ſuch as follow <hi>Durandus</hi> either in words or ſenſe, yet by others it is. Thus <hi>Strangius, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 54. <hi>But we muſt judge, that God doth immediately reach every action and effect of the creature, and that both by the Immediation of virtue and ſuppoſite or perſon. For as God himſelf, ſo his virtue is every where preſent and energetic.</hi> For the proof whereof he cites <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 28. with other Scriptures. So <hi>Ch.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 61. he confeſſeth, that there is a common influxe of God unto al actions, which he cals <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the energie and efficace of God, whereby he doth ſubordinate ſecond Cauſes to himſelf; ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are or do act, they eſſentially depend on him in both reſpects.</hi> Whereby he ſeems to evince, that Gods Influxe doth not only render the ſubject habile to act, but alſo immediately reach the very act, even that has ſin annexed to it. The like he addes, <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 760. <q>It may truely be ſaid, and men are wont ſo to ſpeak, That God is the cauſe of vitioſe actions, albeit he be not the cauſe of the actions as they are vitioſe.</q> And more fully <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 783. <q>From what has been ſaid, it may in ſome manner be underſtood, how in a ſane ſenſe God may be ſaid to impel or incline to ſome ſin, when yet he is void of al ſin: ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if theſe things be obſerved. (1) That it be not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that God moves or inclines men to ſin in general. (2) Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that it be ſaid, that God moves to al ſin, but only to ſuch, in which he uſeth depraved wils as inſtruments to execute his good works. (3) Neither that it be underſtood, that God doth properly move to ſin ſimply and formally taken, or ſin as ſin; but only to the material of ſin, <hi>i. e.</hi> not to the ſin of the Action, but to the Action as ſubſtrate to the ſin, ſo that he be not the Author of the vitioſitie, which he only permits, but of the ſubſtrate Act, and of his own direction and ordination, which he exerciſeth about the vitioſe Action, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> Yea in Actions intrinſecally ſinful, he ſeems to grant, that the Act, as it is a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57509:21"/>
phyſic or natural Being, is from God. So <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>p.</hi> 876. <q>That which is alſo true of Actions which are intrinſecally evil, ſuch as the hatred of God, perjurie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which alſo we muſt diſtinguiſh the phyſic or natural Being from the Ethic or moral evil.</q>—That God concurs to the phyſic action, but not to the moral vice of the action we have above ſhewen. There are two obſervables in theſe conceſſions of <hi>Strangius,</hi> which, if he were candid and uniforme in granting us, would put a period to the controverſie. [1] <hi>That in Actions intrinſecally evil there is a phyſic or natural entitie ſeparable from the ethic or moral vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſitie.</hi> [2] <hi>That the phyſic or natural entitie of al ſinful Actions, even ſuch as are intrinſecally ſinful, is immediately from God, as the firſt cauſe of Nature.</hi> But I muſt confeſſe, I cannot find that <hi>Strangius</hi> is candid or uniforme in theſe his conceſſions, but elſewhere he ſeems to overthrow what he has here granted. For, [1] He ſometimes aſſerts, that the natural act of hating God is ſo intrinſecally evil, as that the vitioſitie cannot be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it. Again, [2] albeit he ſeem frequently to grant an immediate concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſinful acts, yet when he comes to explain what he intends thereby, he doth too much verge unto, if not wholly eſpouſe <hi>Durandus</hi>'s mediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe, as to acts intrinſecally evil. Thus alſo <hi>Amyraldus,</hi> as it is wel noted by <hi>Le Blanc, Theſ. Conciliat. Arbitrii,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 48. <hi>p.</hi> 436.</p>
                     <p>9. Prop. <hi>That Gods Providence is univerſally and efficaciouſly active in the directing and governing the Sins of men unto his own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi> This moſt of the new Methodiſts grant, albeit ſome ſeem to denie it, at leaſt in part. Our Propoſition is granted by <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 469. <q>Neither doth it follow from our opinion, that any free act is ſubſtracted from the Providence of God, if man doth that which God permits, ſithat whether it be good or evil that man doth, God muſt foreknow, and direct and order it to the end appointed by himſelf. So <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 760. `Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore it muſt be obſerved, which we have oft mentioned, that God albeit he doth not wil ſin as ſin, yet he doth adviſedly permit, direct, and ordain it in the beſt manner, to execute his righteous judgements, and illuſtrate his glorie. The like <hi>p.</hi> 764. Albeit we denie that God doth ever determine the wil to ſin for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally taken, or to the actions unto which ſin is neceſſarily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, yet we acknowledge, that God doth ſo rule and order
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57509:22"/>
the ſinful wils of Men and Devils, that by permitting tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, offering objects, ſubminiſtrating occaſions, denying Grace, which he owes to none, letting looſe the reins to Satan, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving impediments, or by operating in any other ſecret man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the event which he pre-appoints infallibly follows, and ſpecially that that work be performed, for the effecting of which God uſeth their miniſterie.</q> How much would this conceſſion conduce to put a period to this controverſie, were our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries but ingenuous in their aſſent and conſent to it? Doth he not ſay here as much as we, abating only the terme Predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? and yet elſewhere how doth he ſtart off from what is here granted?</p>
                     <p>10. Prop. <hi>That God doth no way concur or predetermine the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wil to the ſubſtrate mater or entitative act of ſin ſo as to be the cauſe or author of Sin.</hi> This Propoſition we chearfully and with our whole Souls aſſent and conſent unto; although it be the grand deſigne and unwearied endeavors of our Adverſaries, both Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, Jeſuites, Arminians and new Methodiſts, to faſten the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis on us, namely, <hi>That we make God to be the Author of ſin.</hi> Which Imputation has been in al Ages of the Chriſtian Church faſtened on thoſe that defended Efficacious Grace and Divine Concurſe, as we ſhal ſhew in what follows, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>§. 2. Having laid down the general Propoſitions, wherein our<note place="margin">Wherein our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> Opponents generally, though not without ſome variation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with us, it follows, <hi>that we ſhew briefly wherein they differ among themſelves.</hi> Indeed, ſo great is the difference of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, ſpecially the New Methodiſts, <hi>Amyraldus, Baronius, Strangius, Le Blanc,</hi> and others among themſelves in this point touching Gods efficacious concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin, as that it is very difficult for us to forme commun principes or Hypotheſes wherein they al agree. And albeit they generally agree in their oppoſing our Hypotheſis, touching Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate predeterminative concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons intrinſecally evil, yet they lay down their own Antitheſis with ſo much caution, ſuſpenſion, and heſitation of mind, as if they were afraid the contrary might prove true. <hi>Placeus, Tractat. de Liber. Arbit. p.</hi> 174. cunningly waves the determination of the Queſtion, with this modeſt concelement of his mind: <hi>Truely we, according to the reverence we have towards the infinite Majeſtie of God, dare not define what the Dependence of the ſecond cauſe on the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57509:22"/>
firſt is:</hi> It ſufficeth us, <hi>that too much dependence cannot be aſſerted, provided that it doth not aſperſe God with any the leaſt spot of our ſins.</hi> Which we readily cloſe with, renouncing al ſuch dependence as brings the holy God under the imputation of ſin. So <hi>Baronius, Metaph. Sect.</hi> 8. <hi>Diſp.</hi> 3. §. 78. <hi>pag.</hi> 147. having given us the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> previous predeterminative concurſe, namely, <hi>that the human wil is in al its motions excited by God, and efficaciouſly,</hi> i. e. <hi>irreſiſtibly moved, first to act, and then to act this rather than that,</hi> before he undertakes the refutation hereof he thus premoniſhes us: <hi>In the mean while we profeſſe theſe two things: (1) That we do much againſt our wil recede from this opinion, and that becauſe we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo honourably of thoſe great men, which are Patrones thereof. (2) That we are ready, if any thing may follow from this our Doctrine againſt any article of faith, to reject it. Le Blanc, Concil. Arbitr. Hum. Theſ.</hi> 55. <hi>pag.</hi> 438. ſeems to wave the Controverſie; yet <hi>Theſ.</hi> 56. he inclines to the opinion of <hi>Strangius, That God cannot phyſically promove and predetermine free cauſes to acts intrinſecally evil, without being the Author of ſin.</hi> But <hi>Theſ.</hi> 57. he confeſſeth, <hi>That provided God be not made the Author of ſin, the dependence of the ſecond cauſes on the firſt in acting cannot be too much aſſerted,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Theſ.</hi> 58. he concludes, <hi>That the force and efficace of the Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence even about ſinful acts, is not to be reſtrained to a certain gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral indifferent concurſe; but that God doth many ways procure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, direct, and moderate ſinful events.</hi> So great is the heſitation of our Adverſaries. Yea, how frequently do the very ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons differ from themſelves in their ſentiments about this point? Doth not the ſame perſon ſometimes ſeem to grant an univerſal concurſe immediately influencing al natural acts, and yet elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where denie the ſame to acts intrinſecally evil? And ſo in other points controverted by us. But the differences of our Opponents among themſelves are more palpable and viſible as to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Particulars.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>They are greatly confuſed and at variance among themſelves as</hi>

                        <hi>to Gods Preſcience of ſinful acts.</hi> Al the New Methodiſts gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally grant Gods certain preſcience of al ſinful acts, but yet they are at a great difference, yea contradiction among themſelves in the ſtating of it. (1) <hi>Strangius, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 594. tels us, <hi>That among al the modes which are wont to be explicated, that ſeems the moſt probable, which is taken from the preſence of althings in Eternitie.</hi> Wherein he follows the Dominicans, and ſo muſt by conſequence
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57509:23"/>
reſolve the futurition of ſin into the wil of God permitting it, which overthrows his Hypotheſis. Yet <hi>cap. 8. pag.</hi> 622. he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the certaintie of Gods foreknowing future events <hi>into the more Eſſence of God.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 626. he reſolves it <hi>into the actions themſelves and their determinate cauſes.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>cap. 10. pag.</hi> 646. he in down right termes confeſſeth, <hi>That the ſcience of future ſins is referred to the ſcience of Viſion.</hi> Which is al that we contend for, and that which neceſſarily reſolves Gods preſcience of ſin, into the act of his wil permitting it. Some of our Opponents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve Gods certain preſcience of ſin into the <hi>infinitude of his ſcience.</hi> Thus <hi>Le Blanc De Concord. Libert. p 444. Theſ. 39. As for the fourth opinion, which ſecketh the certitude of Divine preſcience in the infinitie of the Divine Intellect, and in the determinate veritie of thoſe things which are contingently future, it layeth down nothing but what is certain and indubitate.</hi> Yet <hi>Theſ.</hi> 40. he confeſſeth, <hi>That this opinion doth not ſatisfie the Queſtion, nor take away the principal difficultie. For that which is here moſt difficult to be underſtood is, how future contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents do from Eternitie paſſe from mere poſſibles into the nature of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that ſo under that reaſon they may be perceived by God.</hi> Which knot he endeavors to untie, by telling us, <hi>that the ſame cauſes that give exiſtence to things future give them alſo their futurition.</hi> But this is a very jejune and poor evaſion, as we ſhal hereafter ſhew, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 1. (3) Others refer Gods certain preſcience of ſin to the Jeſuites <hi>middle ſcience,</hi> whereby God foreſees, that if the wil of man come under ſuch a connexion of cauſes, circumſtances, and providential concurrences, the effect wil certainly follow, albeit in itſelf merely contingent. Thus <hi>Lud. Crocius, Dyodec. Diſſert. Diſſert.</hi> 7. where he largely but weakly defends this <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſcience:</hi> which <hi>Le Blanc, De Concord. Libert. pag. 449.

Theſ.</hi> 42. confeſſeth, <hi>That it wants not great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie, how a thing which is ſuppoſed to depend on a cauſe in itſelf inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate ſhould be certainly knowen by the Divine Intellect: for the Divine Intellect although infinite cannot ſee what is not, nor yet change the nature of its object.</hi> Whence he concludes, <hi>Theſ. 43. That ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is ſo much darkneſſe on al ſides, our ſafeſt and moſt ingenuous courſe is to confeſſe our own ignorance herein.</hi> The like ſubterfuge <hi>Strangius</hi> makes uſe of, <hi>l. 3. c. 5. p. 576. &amp;c. 6. p.</hi> 591. with this pretexte, <hi>That the mode of Divine preſcience is not reveled in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi> A poor refuge indeed! why then do they ſo daringly ſift
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57509:23"/>
and prie into the Divine preſcience, and draw it down to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of our corrupt reaſon? We eaſily grant, that the mode of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſcience is incomprehenſible by poor mortals, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can content our ſelves with ſcriptural deſcriptions thereof: but this we aſſert, that it is impoſſible the Divine preſcience, which is in itſelf moſt certain, ſhould depend on the moſt incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ambulatory wil of man; and ſo much Scripture and Reaſon grounded thereon doth fully demonſtrate.</p>
                     <p>2. Our Adverſaries differ greatly among themſelves <hi>about the</hi>

                        <hi>futurition of ſin, and Gods predefinition thereof.</hi> Strangius, l. 3. c. 11. holds, <hi>That ſome free acts are abſolutely future, and knowen of God as ſuch, without any Decree predetermining the free cauſes to thoſe acts:</hi> and yet he denies, <hi>that thoſe free contingent futures can be knowen by God according to any Hypotheſis, which doth not neceſſarily infer the determination of the create wil; and thence which doth not include an abſolute Decree of their futurition.</hi> Whence it wil follow, <hi>that God can foreknow no contingent ſinful act as abſolutely future, but what he firſt decreed to be abſolutely future;</hi> which yet <hi>Strangius</hi> admits not. Herein he is oppoſed by <hi>Le Blanc, De Concord. Libert. pag.</hi> 455.</p>
                     <p>3. Our Opponents are alſo at variance among themſelves<note place="margin">3. Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe.</note> touching <hi>Gods concurſe, its immediation, totalitie, prioritie, efficace, and predetermination as to ſinful acts.</hi> (1) How many of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the ſentiments of <hi>Durandus,</hi> denying al immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe to ſinful acts? And of thoſe that grant immediate concurſe in termes, how many yet denie it in realitie? Among thoſe that grant immediate concurſe both name and thing, do not many eſpouſe ſuch conſequences as are inconſiſtent therewith, yea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant thereto? (2) Our Adverſaries alſo differ much about Gods total <hi>particular</hi> concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater or entitative act of ſin. Some grant a <hi>total</hi> concurſe to the phyſic entitative act in the general, but not in particular: others grant a total concurſe to the entitative act in particular, abſtracting the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence it has to its object: Thus <hi>Strangius, lib. 2. cap.</hi> 3. who grants, <hi>that God doth concur by a ſpecial concurſe to the ſpecial effects as they are ſpecifically diſtinguiſhed not morally but phyſically;</hi> which is al that we contend for: Others, on the contrary, make Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin only <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>general,</hi> aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Molina, Part. 1. q. 14. a. 3. Diſp. 6. That God is only a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial cauſe of the entitative act of ſin:</hi> So a Divine of name among us; yea he aſſerts, <hi>that God never totally permits ſin.</hi> (3) Our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57509:24"/>
Opponents differ alſo among themſelves touching the <hi>Priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> of Gods concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin. Some grant Gods concurſe hereto <hi>previous,</hi> though not predeterminative; ſo <hi>Strangius:</hi> but others make it to be only <hi>ſimultaneous;</hi> aſſerting, that God concurs with the wil of man in the ſame moment of nature and reaſon, to the ſame act. So <hi>Baronius,</hi> wherein he alſo follows <hi>Lud. Molina</hi> and the Arminians. (4) Laſtly, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal difference among our Adverſaries is about the <hi>Efficacitie</hi> and <hi>Predetermination</hi> of Divine concurſe as to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin. Some make the concurſe of God to be only <hi>general</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi> and ſo <hi>determinable</hi> by the ſecond cauſe, as the influence of the Sun is by the mater it workes upon. Thus <hi>Baronius, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſ. Sect. 8. Diſput. 3. §. 73, 74, 75. pag.</hi> 142, &amp;c. where he makes <hi>Gods concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſinful acts to be the ſame with that of the Sun concurring to the generation of a man or horſe.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he follows the Remonſtrants and Jeſuites, more particularly <hi>Molina, Concord. Liber. Arbitr. cum Grat. donis, &amp;c. Quaeſt. 14. Diſput.</hi> 26. Thus a reverend Divine of name among our ſelves openly aſſerts, <hi>that Gods concurſe is determinable by the creature.</hi> But <hi>Strangius,</hi> albeit he too far fals in with the ſentiments of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> againſt predetermination; yet he rejects this Hypotheſis of a general indifferent concurſe as too groſſe and Pelagian. So <hi>l. 2. c. 3. p. 154. We ſay not therefore, that God concurs only by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concurſe, as the Sun concurs in the ſame manner to the generation of a man, and of an horſe, and of a mouſe; but we determine, that the influxe of God is ſpecial to ſpecial effects, as they are phyſically diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed ſpecie, and unto al kind of entitie, but not to the reaſon of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral iniquitie, which conſiſtes in privation. Strangius</hi> here ſeems to oppoſe <hi>Baronius</hi>'s Hypotheſis touching a general indifferent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe; but yet, I muſt confeſſe, upon a more accurate reſearch I cannot find that he differs materially from <hi>Baronius</hi> herein: for although <hi>l. 1. c. 11. p.</hi> 61. he cals this concurſe <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>efficace,</hi> yet he makes it be but commun, and no way <hi>determinative,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only <hi>indifferent.</hi> The like <hi>l. 2. c. 19. p.</hi> 373. And I am very poſitive in this, that no man living can rationally exemt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the imputation of the Jeſuites indifferent concurſe, and aſſert an efficacious ſpecial concurſe, but what is determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as to the ſubject it workes on. And thence <hi>Le Blanc, Concil. Arbitr. part. 3. theſ. 36. p.</hi> 434. confeſſeth, <hi>That</hi> Strangius'<hi>s opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as to this point differs but little from that of</hi> Baronius. Laſtly,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57509:24"/>
                        <hi>Baronius</hi> denies al <hi>predetermination both as to good and evil actions;</hi> as <hi>Metaph. Sect. 8. Diſput. 3. §. 78, &amp;c. p. 146. Strangius</hi> allows <hi>predetermination to al acts moraly though but imperfectly good, and to many other acts of the wil, whenſoever God pleaſeth, or need requireth;</hi> yet he denies it <hi>to al acts of the creatures, ſpecially to ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally evil,</hi> as <hi>lib. 2. cap. 4. pag.</hi> 162. and elſewhere. Herein he is followed by ſome Divines of note among our ſelves, who I am very confident wil never be able to maintain their ſingular Hypotheſis, but wil at laſt be driven to the opinion of <hi>Baronius,</hi> the Remonſtrants, and Jeſuites, or elſe fal under the lode of al thoſe black conſequences they clog our Hypotheſis with; of which hereafter, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 4.</p>

Some, and thoſe of no ſmal repute among our ſelves, hold ſin, as to its <hi>formal reaſon,</hi> to <hi>be a poſitive real Being:</hi> which indeed is moſt agreable to their Hypotheſis touching <hi>acts intrinſecally evil,</hi> which they denie to be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57509:25"/>
as to their ſubſtrate mater or entitative act from God. I muſt confeſſe this opinion would carry ſomewhat of probabilitie with it, if we could with the Manichees hold two firſt Principes or Cauſes, one of <hi>good,</hi> the other of <hi>evil;</hi> but for us that aſſert but one firſt Cauſe of al create poſitive Beings, I cannot imagine how any can maintain this Hypotheſis of the <hi>poſitivitie of ſin,</hi> without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God the Author of ſin, or making mans corrupt wil inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and ſo the firſt cauſe of a real poſitive act. Therefore <hi>Strangius, lib. 1. cap.</hi> 13. to avoid theſe black conſequences ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argues, with the Orthodoxe, <hi>that the formal reaſon of ſin conſiſtes in privation.</hi> But withal we are here to note, that this Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis utterly overthrows his other Hypotheſis touching acts intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecally evil, which he denies to be from God as to their ſubſtrate mater; of which more hereafter, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 5.</p>
                     <p>There are other points of moment wherein our Antagoniſts differ among themſelves, as wel as from us; namely, touching the <hi>natural or moral libertie of the wil, natural impoſſibilitie and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, Gods decretive and approbative wil,</hi> of which before <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. And indeed we need no way wonder, that our Adverſaries thus differ among themſelves, ſithat their Hypotheſis is liable to ſo many inconſiſtences and contradictions: for how is it poſſible, that they ſhould agree among themſelves, when as their principal Hypotheſis is ſo diſagreeing from itſelf? But more of this when we come to the demonſtrative part, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. We procede now to ſhew, <hi>Wherein we differ from thoſe of</hi>

                        <hi>the new method,</hi> Strangius, Baronius, Le Blanc, <hi>and others, about Gods concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin.</hi> Immediately on the breaking up of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> wherein the Antitheſes and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the Arminians were ſo ſtrongly and fully refuted, there ſprang up ſome Divines, who gave their aſſent and conſent to the Canons of the ſaid Synod, but yet contrived a new method, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to <hi>univerſal Grace, Reprobation,</hi> and <hi>Gods concurſe to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate mater of ſin,</hi> in order to a coalition with the Arminian par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as we ſhal hereafter demonſtrate. And the principal Agent, who undertook the new modelling this laſt head, was <hi>Strangius;</hi> which he has copioſely treated of, according to the new method, in his Book, <hi>De Voluntate &amp; Actionibus Dei circa peccatum:</hi> whoſe ſentiments we are to examine in what follows; but at preſent we ſhal only lay down in ſeveral Propoſitions wherein we differ from him, and thoſe who follow his method in the ſtating Gods Concurſe to the mater of ſin.

                        <hi>mater or entitative act of al ſin.</hi> This Propoſition <hi>Strangius, lib. 3. cap. 2. pag.</hi> 547. grants to be true in althings but ſin; ſpecially the firſt ſin, and ſuch acts as are intrinſecally evil: which ſufficiently proves our Propoſition; for we ſay and are ready to demonſtrate, that the ſubſtrate mater or entitative act whereto ſin is annexed, is not in itſelf or its natural entitie ſinful, but naturally good. What there is of ſin annexed to it ariſeth from its moral eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and relation to the Law of God violated thereby: in which regard we peremptorily denie that it is from God. Yea <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, lib. 3. cap. 4. pag.</hi> 569. grants, <hi>That God is the cauſe of the act, though he doth not abſolutely predeſtine or decree the ſame:</hi> and then to that objection of <hi>Alvarez, That the Divine preordination and eternal predefinition extendes itſelf to al thoſe things unto which the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalitie and efficience of God extendes,</hi> he replies, <hi>That God decrees althings either abſolutely or reſpectively.</hi> But this is a very poor Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian evaſion: for <hi>reſpective</hi> or <hi>conditional</hi> Decrees are every way unbecoming the Divine perfections of God, as our Divines, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>Davenant Animadverſ:</hi> againſt <hi>Hoard, pag.</hi> 226. have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt the Arminians. Laſtly, <hi>Strangius, lib. 3. cap. 5. p.</hi> 576. denies, <hi>That God decrees al ſins, ſpecially the firſt ſin:</hi> which we ſhal in its place endeavor to prove, with the ſolution of his obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt it.

                     <p>3. Prop. <hi>The permiſſive Decree of God about ſin is not idle but effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious.</hi>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57509:26"/>
God, whereby he permits al ſin, is efficacious, albeit not effective. For ſo the fal of</hi> Adam <hi>and al other ſins ſhould procede from the efficace of the Divine Decree: which is an hard ſaying. Neither is that leſſe hard, which ſome affirme, that God hath abſolutely decreed, that men do not more good than what they do, and omit not more evil than what they omit.</hi> This Hypotheſis is ſo far from being hard, as that I conceive <hi>Strangius</hi>'s oppoſite perſuaſion is moſt dangerous and deſtructive of the Divine Decrees, as we ſhal ſhew in its place. Yea <hi>Strangius</hi> himſelf, in what follows, <hi>pag.</hi> 557. grants what <hi>Lombard, lib. 1. diſt.</hi> 47. aſſertes, namely, <hi>that the wil of God is always efficacious,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

What God decreed to do, thoſe things he knows in his wil.</hi> This ſentence of <hi>Hilarie Strangius, lib. 3. cap. 5. pag.</hi> 576. ownes as orthodox, but yet denies, <hi>that the abſolute Decree of God is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of knowing althings.</hi> So <hi>Le Blanc, de Concord.

                           </gap>3. I ſee no reaſon, why we ſhould denie unto God the knowledge of thoſe things which are freely future under a certain condition, albeit in that condition there be not included a decree of predetermining the free cauſe to this or that.</hi> But <hi>Scotus</hi> and his followers fully eſpouſe our Hypotheſis, aſſerting, <hi>That God certainly knows al future contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, becauſe his Divine Eſſence, which is the reaſon of knowing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentes to the Divine Intellect the thing determinately future from the determination of his own wil.</hi> And then as to the preſcience of ſin, they hold, <hi>That albeit God doth not predefine ſins as ſuch, yet he predefines the permiſſion of ſins, in which he knows them to be future.</hi> Which is orthodox, and that which we ſhal demonſtrate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 2.</p>

So <hi>Strangius, lib. 3. cap. 4. pag. 568. But if it be ſaid, that God predefined and predetermined that</hi> Adam <hi>ſhould at that very time eat, abſtracting from the object which he did eat of, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be.</hi> Then he gives his reaſons, why God could not predefine and predetermine <hi>Adam</hi> to the act of eating, abſtracting it from the reference it has to its object. And then he addes: <hi>Moreover
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57509:26"/>
we denie, that it belongs to the Perfection of God or of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he abſolutely predefine al free acts, and predetermin the Wil unto them.</hi> The Arguments he urgeth for this his Antitheſis we ſhal endeavor to ſolve, and demonſtrate our own hypotheſis in its due place, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. §. 1.</p>
                     <p>6. Prop. <hi>Gods predefinition of and predetermination to the ſubſtrate</hi>

                        <hi>mater of ſinful Acts deſtroys not their Libertie. Strangius</hi> and his Sectators grant, <hi>That Predefinition and Predetermination deſtroyes not that Libertie which is eſſential to the Wil, but only that which conſiſtes in Indifference.</hi> So <hi>Strangius, l. 3. c. 14. p.</hi> 681, 682, 683, 685, 686. and <hi>c. 16. p.</hi> 711. But how frivolous this opinion is, and how unapt to ſerve the deſigne for which it was coined, we have already intimated, <hi>c.</hi> 1. §. 3. and intend more fully to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. §. 5.</p>
                     <p>7. Prop. <hi>Predefinition in the divine Decree and Predetermination</hi>

                        <hi>in time of thoſe entitative Acts whereunto ſin is annexed, do not make God the Author of Sin.</hi> This is the principal point in controverſie, the Antitheſis whereof is ſtrongly urged, though weakly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by our Opponents. Thus <hi>Strangius, l. 3. c. 2. p. 548. But I judge it no way conſentaneous to the natural ſanctitie of God, that he wil and decree ſin to be, the vitioſitie to exiſt, and that he predefine ſuch acts, whereunto the vitioſitie is neceſſarily annexed; ſpecially the Fal of the evil Angels and our firſt Parents, from whence al ſins ſprang.</hi> So <hi>c. 5. p. 579. Whether it be ſaid from the permiſſion, or from the Decree of God permitting, or from the action of which God is the cauſe, that ſin is neceſſarily inferred, truely the neceſſity of ſinning is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to God as the Author; namely becauſe he decreed and cauſed that from which ſin neceſſarily follows.</hi> The like <hi>p. 587. Neither hath God predetermined the wil of Adam to the very act of eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, which yet as to its entitie is reduced to God as the firſt cauſe: neither was that act or its vitioſitie neceſſarily inferred from the permiſſion of God.</hi> That this Antitheſis of <hi>Strangius</hi> and his Sectators is moſt falſe, and our Hypotheſis moſt true, it remains on us to demonſtrate, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have given the true and ful ſtate of our Controverſie; which by reaſon of the ſubtile evaſions and ſubterfuges of our Adverſaries lies under ſo much obſcuritie and confuſion: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is to me a deplorable caſe, and that which argues mens diffidence of the merits of their cauſe, that they contend with ſo much paſſionate vehemence for their own <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> and yet

never explicate the termes, or ſtate the Queſtion in controverſie. I have thereby given the Reader as wel as my ſelf the more trouble in this part of our Province, that ſo what follows may be the more facile both for him and me.</p>

And becauſe al de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration muſt be grounded on ſome firſt principes, which give evidence, firmitude and force thereto; and there are no proper principes of Faith and Theologie, but what are originally
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57509:27"/>
in the Scriptures, we are therefore to begin our Demonſtration<note place="margin">Scriptural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations.</note> with Scriptural Arguments, which we ſhal reduce to theſe ſeven heads. (1) <hi>Such Scriptures wherein it is univerſally affirmed, that God is the firſt Cauſe of al natural actions and things, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of al even the moſt contingent acts of mans Wil. (2) Such Scriptures as directly demonſtrate, That God doth predefine, prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, and foreordain ſuch natural actions whereunto ſin is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily annexed. (3) Such Scriptures wherein God is ſaid to make uſe of wicked Inſtruments for the puniſhment of his People, in ſuch a way wherein they could not but contract guilt. (4) Such Scriptures as mention Gods own immediate hand in thoſe acts whereunto ſin is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent. (5) Such Scriptures as mention Gods efficacious permiſſion of ſome to ſin. (6) Such Scriptures as demonſtrate Gods giving up ſome to judicial Occecation and Obduration. (7) Such as clearly evince Gods ordering and diſpoſing the Sins of men for his own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 1. We ſhal begin our Scriptural Demonſtration with ſuch<note place="margin">1. God the firſt Cauſe of al na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Actions and Things.</note> Texts as univerſally affirme, <hi>That God is the firſt cauſe of al natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Actions and Things; and more particularly, of al even the moſt contingent acts of mans Wil. 1. The Scriptures that ſpeak God to be the firſt Cauſe of al natural Actions and Things,</hi> are many and great: we ſhal mention ſome; as, <hi>Eſa. 26. 12. Thou haſt wrought al our</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eſa. 26. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>works in us,</hi> or <hi>for us.</hi> This Text is urged by <hi>Strangius, p.</hi> 54. to prove Gods immediate concurſe to al actions of the creature, though it doth in a more peculiar manner regard the deliverance of the Church; wherein God predetermines and over-rules ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny actions of wicked men, which have much ſin annexed to them. Again, this univerſal prime Cauſalitie of God efficaciouſly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing al natural Acts and Effects is apparently expreſſed <hi>Rom.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 36.</note> 11. 36. <hi>For of him, and through him, and to him are althings. Of him,</hi> as he frames althings; <hi>By him,</hi> as he operates in and coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates with althings; <hi>and for him,</hi> as the final cauſe of althings. Thus Gods <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>multiforme energie,</hi> as <hi>Cyril</hi> ſtiles it, reacheth al manner of Natural actions and effects: and if ſo, then ſurely ſuch natural entitative Actions as have ſin annexed to them. Is there any ſin ſo intrinſecally evil, which has not ſome entitative act or ſubject as the ſubſtrate mater thereof? And if althings are <hi>of God,</hi> and <hi>by him,</hi> and <hi>for him,</hi> muſt not alſo the entitative act of ſins intrinſecally evil be ſo? <hi>Strangius, p.</hi> 342. replies thus: <hi>Al that God workes muſt tend to his Glorie: But what
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57509:28"/>
Glorie redounds to God from thoſe Actions of hatred of God, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie?</hi> &amp;c. A ſtrange replie indeed for a Divine to make. (1) Was there not much Hatred of God, and Blaſphemie in the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of Chriſt? And yet was there any action more conducing to the glorie of God than this? Yea, (2) Doth not <hi>Strangius</hi> himſelf, and thoſe of his partie grant, that God <hi>directs, diſpoſeth,</hi> and <hi>over-rules</hi> al ſinful acts, even ſuch as are intrinſecally evil, ſo as that they conduce to his glorie? And how can God direct, diſpoſe, and over-rule them, unleſs he concur, yea predetermine the Wil to the entitative act? Again <hi>Strangius, p.</hi> 561. anſwers to this Text thus: <hi>None that is orthodoxe ever extended theſe words to ſins;</hi> as <hi>if ſins were of God, by God, and for him,</hi> &amp;c. [1] Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we extend theſe words to ſins formally conſidered: [2] But muſt we thence neceſſarily conclude, that the entita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive act, whereto ſin is only accidentally appendent, is not from God, nor by him, nor for him? Yea, [3] May we not ſay with Divines, that ſin formally conſidered, although it be not <hi>of God and by him as an Efficient,</hi> yet it is <hi>for him,</hi> i. e. conducing to his Glorie, as wiſely ordered and over-ruled contrary to the intent of the ſinner? Thus much <hi>Auguſtin</hi> once and again inculcates, as <hi>De Geneſ. ad liter. lib. Imperfecto,</hi> cap. 5. <note n="*" place="margin">Nam &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorum noſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum non eſt auctor Deus, ſed tamen or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinator eſt.</note> 
                        <hi>For God is not the Author of our ſins, yet he is the Ordinator of them,</hi> &amp;c. And thus much indeed <hi>Strangius,</hi> p. 860. confeſſeth.</p>
                     <p>Another Text that evidently and invincibly demonſtrates Gods efficacious predeterminative Concurſe to al natural as wel as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Actions and Effects is, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 11. Who worketh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things</hi>

                        <hi>after the counſel of his own wil.</hi> We find three particulars in this Texte which greatly conduce to explicate and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate Gods efficacious Concurſe to al Actions, and particularly to the ſubſtrate mater of ſinful acts. (1) We may conſider the object, <hi>althings,</hi> i. e. whatever is clothed with the Notion and Idea of real poſitive entitie: <hi>althings</hi> muſt be here taken diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively into al ſingulars: there is no Being, that partakes of real entitie but is wrought by God. (2) Here is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, the <hi>Act, <gap reason="foreign">

It notes here Gods efficacious predeterminative Concurſe, working in and with althings, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their natural propenſions. Thence (3) follows the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57509:28"/>
original principe of this predeterminative efficacious operation, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>according to the counſel of his own wil.</hi> Which notes, that Gods efficacious predeterminative wil is the ſupreme and firſt cauſe of althings: there is no execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power in God diſtinct from his Wil: his Concurſe in regard of its active attingence is no more than his ſimple volition: ſo that divine Predetermination is the ſame with divine Predefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, as we have largely demonſtrated, <hi>Court Gent. P. 4. c.</hi> 7. §. 3. Whence alſo it follows, that <hi>Gods working althings according to the counſel of his wil,</hi> has one and the ſame Idea with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determining al actions and effects, even ſuch as have ſin appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to them. <hi>Strangius,</hi> p. 560. replies to the Argument drawen from this Text thus: <hi>From this place nothing more can be collected, than that God has decreed thoſe things that he worketh: as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that God hath decreed nothing which he doth not execute—not that God worketh ſins,</hi> &amp;c. [1] This Text ſpeaks more than what <hi>Strangius</hi> allows it to ſpeake, namely, that God has not only decreed thoſe things that he worketh, but alſo that he works by his Decree, or omnipotent Volition: for we owne no other executive power in God but his divine Wil, as <hi>Scotus, Bradwardine,</hi> and ſome of the greateſt Scholaſtic Theologues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate. [2] Who ſaith, that God worketh Sins? ſurely none but <hi>Marcion</hi> or <hi>Manes,</hi> or ſuch as hold Sin to be a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive real Being. [3] But yet we do with the Orthodoxe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and prove from this Scripture, <hi>that God worketh</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titative natural Act, whereunto ſin is appendent: for otherwiſe, how can he be ſaid to worke althings? Is this good ſenſe or Logic, to ſay, God workes althings, not only according to their generic or ſpecific diſtribution, but alſo according to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution into each ſingular, (for ſo the Syncategoreme <hi>Al</hi> is here taken) but yet he worketh not al ſingular entities, namely the ſubſtrate mater of Sin? Doth this amount to leſs than a down-right contradiction? He workes althings, but yet doth not worke althings? What Logic or wit of man can reconcile theſe Notions?</p>
                     <p>2. Unto our firſt Head we may alſo reduce ſuch Scriptures, as in a more particular manner mention Gods efficacious predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative concurſe to al human actions and effects, even ſuch as are moſt contingent and dependent on the ambulatory wil of man. Thus <hi>Pſal. 33. 15. He faſhioneth their hearts alike: he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth<note place="margin">Pſal. 33. 15.</note>

                           </gap>, who faſhioneth, formeth, frameth,</hi> as the Potter doth his clay: it notes not only, yea not ſo much the firſt <hi>Creation</hi> of the human Soul, as its actual <hi>figments, frames, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations</hi> and <hi>thoughts:</hi> this is evident from the ſcope and contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the words: for what is the Pſalmiſts intent and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takement, but to demonſtrate Gods infinite preſcience, and its perfect comprehenſion of al the figments, frames, thoughts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and affections of the heart, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14? And how doth he prove this? Why, <hi>becauſe he faſhioneth their hearts alike, i. e.</hi> puts al the firſt thoughts, inclinations, intentions and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the heart into what forme, frame, or faſhion he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. There is alſo a great Emphaſe and ſignificance in that terme <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which we render <hi>alike,</hi> but may be as properly rendred <hi>together,</hi> as it is by the Latine <hi>ſimul;</hi> neither is it to be referred to the Verbe <hi>frameth,</hi> but to the object <hi>Hearts:</hi> and ſo it notes an univerſalitie diſtributive into al ſingulars, without the leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any. And then the ſenſe wil be; who <hi>faſhioneth, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> or <hi>frameth</hi> the hearts of al mankind in al their very firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, conceptions, imaginations, reſolutions, end, intereſts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivements, ebullitions, affections, proſecutions, and fruitions, or other actions whatſoever. Whence he addes, <hi>He conſidereth al their works:</hi> what <hi>works</hi> doth he mean? Surely not only the works and labors of mens hands, but alſo the workings, movements, and figments of their hearts: and how can God conſider them, if he did not forme, frame and faſhion them? Yea, there yet lies a deeper notion in the coherence of theſe parts; namely, that Gods forming, framing and faſhioning the hearts of al men is the ground and cauſe of his conſidering their works: For how God can perfectly conſider and know the works of mens hearts, unleſſe he be the <hi>former, framer,</hi> and <hi>faſhioner</hi> of them al, as to their real entitative acts, al the wit of man can never deviſe or make clear unto us. So that Gods <hi>Science of Viſion,</hi> or <hi>Preſcience</hi> as to the figments of mans heart ariſeth from this, that God is the framer, former, and faſhioner of mens hearts and al their natural move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which alſo implies his predefinition and predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans heart and al its firſt motions, inclinations, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. So then to forme and ſum up our Argument from this Text: Doth God indeed faſhion, forme and frame the hearts of al men in al their natural motions, imaginations, and affections? And may we without apparent contradiction to the light of this
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57509:29"/>
Text exclude the entitative acts of any ſins, though never ſo intrinſecally evil? What is this but to exclude the far greateſt part of human acts from being formed and framed by God? Or how can the omniſcient God conſider al the works of mens hearts, if he be not the former and faſhioner of them al, as to their natural entitie? I muſt confeſſe the validitie of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Gods preſcience is to me ſo firme and great, as that ſhould it be baffled, I ſee no way left, but to turne Socinian, and ſo to denie the certaintie of Gods preſcience as to the <hi>contingent ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations</hi> of mans heart, which implies much Atheiſme.</p>
                     <p>Another Text that proves Gods efficacious and predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Concurſe as to al human acts is <hi>Prov. 21. 1. The Kings heart is</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 21. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water; he turneth it whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he wil.</hi> (1) He mentions <hi>the Kings heart,</hi> as the meaſure of al other mens; becauſe Kings generally have a greater Soverain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Dominion over their own hearts, than other men: if any mens hearts may plead the privilege of exemtion from Gods effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious predeterminative Concurſe, ſurely Kings may, ſpecially ſuch as <hi>Solomon</hi> was, who obtained from God ſuch an amplitude of Soul, and ſelf-Dominion: yet he grants, that <hi>the Kings heart</hi> was not exemted therefrom. (2) By the <hi>Heart</hi> we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, according to the Hebraic mode, the whole ſoul, and al its movements, imaginations, ratiocinations, contrivements, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and undertakements. (3) <hi>In the hand of the Lord: i. e.</hi> under his efficacious predeterminative influxe or concurſe. The <hi>Hand</hi> being the inſtrument of our moſt potent operations, it's uſually put in Scripture for the energetic, potent and predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative Concurſe of God: So <hi>Hab. 3. 4. He [i. e.</hi> Chriſt whoſe<note place="margin">Hab. 3. 4.</note> brightneſſe was as the light] <hi>had hornes, [i. e.</hi> beams, as <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> notes] <hi>coming out of his hands [i. e.</hi> moſt potent wil, the ſpring of al his efficacious operations: whence it follows] <hi>and there was the hiding of his power, i. e.</hi> his moſt potent efficacious predeterminative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe lay hid in the beams irradiated from his omnipotent hand or wil. So <hi>Act. 11. 21. And the hand of the Lord was with them,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 11. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>i. e.</hi> the efficacious predeterminative power of Divine Grace; the hand being the inſtrument whereby man exertes and puts forth his power. So <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaying, <hi>That the hearts of Kings are in the hand of God,</hi> it muſt be underſtood of Gods puiſſant predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Concurſe, whereby he applies the heart to its acts, conduceth and guideth it therein, and determineth it as he pleaſeth. So it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57509:30"/>
follows, (4) <hi>As the rivers of waters, he turneth it whitherſoever he wil.</hi> How eaſie is it by <hi>Aquaducts</hi> to turne waters this or that way as men pleaſe? And is it not infinitely more facile for the wiſe omnipontent God, to turne the hearts of men, and al their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conceptions, products, and iſſues which way he liſtes? Al this may be evinced from <hi>Strangius</hi>'s gloſſe on this Text, <hi>lib. 1. cap. 9. pag.</hi> 50. where having given us the mention of Gods preſerving and directing the wils of men even in evil actions, he addes a third and more ſpecial mode of Divine influence, <hi>whereby God doth bend, impel, and incline human wils which way he pleaſe, not by proper compulſion, but by ſweet inſpiration and motion: For albeit God doth never take away that libertie which is eſſential to the wil, yet he doth at times, and when he pleaſe, efficaciouſly move and impel the wils of men: and what</hi> Solomon <hi>predicates of the Kings heart,</hi> Prov. 21. 1. <hi>that very ſame may, on a greater account, be affirmed of the heart of every man.</hi> So <hi>Auguſtin, de Grat. &amp; Liber. Arbitr. cap. 20. If the Scripture be diligently inſpected, it ſhews, that not only the good wils of men, but even the bad are ſo in the power of God, that where he wil and when he wil, he cauſeth them to be inclined, either to performe benefits, or to inflict puniſhments, by a moſt ſecret, yet juſt judgement.</hi> So again <hi>Auguſt. de Corrept. &amp; Grat. cap. 6. God hath in his power the wils of men, more than they themſelves; without dout having moſt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power to incline mens hearts where he pleaſeth.</hi> What could be ſaid more categorically and poſitively to evince Gods effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and predeterminative Concurſe to al the natural products and iſſues of mans heart, even ſuch as have intrinſecal evil, as they cal it, appendent to them? Yea, <hi>Strangius, lib. 2. cap. 7. p.</hi> 182. grants, <q>That God doth ſometimes efficaciouſly move and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determine the wils of men not only to ſupernatural workes, but alſo to natural and civil, as oft as it ſeems good to him, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme certain ends which he has preordained.</q> So <hi>Prov. 16. 7. He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</hi> And how ſo? Surely by over-ruling their hearts even in the ſinful movements. Thus he bent and determined the revengeful mind of <hi>Eſau</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. So he gained the hearts of the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians towards the Iſraelities, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11. 2, 3. &amp; 12. 35, 36. Thus God determined the wil of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to bring back the Captivitie of the Jews, 2 <hi>Chron. 36. 22. Ezra</hi> 1. 1. Thus God bent the mind of <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to grant the Jews libertie for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building the Temple, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 1, &amp;c. &amp; 7. 2. <hi>Neh.</hi> 2. 4. So God
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57509:30"/>
dealt with <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s enemies, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 11. Al theſe predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations even in civil and natural actions are allowed by <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius:</hi> whence we argue, That it is impoſſible, but that God ſhould predetermine to the ſubſtrate mater of ſinful actions: for al theſe actions being exerted by wicked men, had nothing of moral or ſupernatural good in them, albeit God made uſe of them for the ſuccour of his people, yea they were ful of hatred againſt God.</p>
                     <p>To theſe Scriptures we may adde, <hi>Act. 17. 28. For in him we</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>live, and move, and have our being.</hi> Not only <hi>Being</hi> in general, and <hi>Life,</hi> which implies more than ſimple being, but alſo al our <hi>move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> or <hi>motions</hi> are from God as the prime Motor: which <hi>Paul</hi> demonſtrates out of one of their own Poets: <hi>for we are alſo his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring.</hi> As if he had ſaid: Do not your own Poets tel you, that we are the off-ſpring of God? Is he not then the firſt Cauſe and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of al our motions? Doth not <hi>Ariſtotle, Phyſ.</hi> 8. alſo ſtrongly demonſtrate, <hi>That al our natural motions muſt ariſe from one first immobile Motor?</hi> And to whom doth this Prerogative belong but to God? Muſt not then the ſubſtrate mater of al ſinful motions, even ſuch as are intrinſecally evil, be reduced unto God as the prime Motor?</p>
                     <p>I ſhal conclude this firſt Head of ſcriptural Arguments with <hi>Jam. 4. 15. For that ye ought to ſay, If the Lord wil, we ſhal live,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jam. 4. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>and do this or that.</hi> There were a number of Free-willers, who proudly conceited, that they had an abſolute and plenary domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over their own wils and actions; whom <hi>James</hi> rebukes, and tels them, they ought to ſay, <hi>If the Lord wil,</hi> &amp;c. So that he plainly reſolves al the acts of mans wil into the wil of God, as the original Cauſe and Principe. But let us ſee how poorly <hi>Strangius</hi> ſhifts off the force of this Argument, <hi>lib. 2. cap. 10. pag.</hi> 227. he ſaith, <hi>Who ever underſtood theſe words, if God wil,</hi> i. e. <hi>if God prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine my wil to do this or that?</hi> Then he addes his own gloſſe: <hi>But truly nothing more can be underſtood by that condition, IF GOD WIL, than this, if God ſhal permit, or wil permit, as it is elſewhere expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, Act. 16. 7. &amp; 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 7. I muſt confeſſe I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that a perſon of ſo great reaſon, and under ſo many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and aſſiſtances from Divine Revelation, ſhould ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſo ſlender an evaſion, which not only Reaſon and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but even Pagan Philoſophemes contradict. For (1) it is moſt evident, that <hi>James</hi> here, (as <hi>Luke, Act.</hi> 16. 7. and <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 7.) ſpeakes not of a mere permiſſive wil, but of an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57509:31"/>
influential concurſe, ariſing from the wil of God, which is the alone principe and ſpring of Divine concurſe: for al actions both natural, civil, and ſupernatural muſt be reſolved into the wil of God, as their prime cauſe: ſo that <hi>If God wil</hi> here, is the ſame with <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And that this is the genuine mind of this Text is moſt evident by the uſe of this phraſe among the Ancients both Jews and Pagans. <hi>Benſyra,</hi> that ancient Hebrew, <hi>Sent. moral. xi.</hi> thus ſpeakes: <hi>Let man never ſay he wil do any thing, before he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced this, If the Lord wil, i. e.</hi> aſſiſte or concur, not permit.

So the ſame Phraſe muſt be underſtood, <hi>Act. 18. 21. If God wil,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 19. If</hi>

                        <hi>the Lord wil.</hi> Is it poſſible that theſe Phraſes ſhould be underſtood of a mere permiſſive wil? Do not al mankind need an efficacious concurſe and predeterminative wil to conduct them in al their affaires? Again, (2) Gods permiſſive wil is either <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral:</hi> it cannot be meant of Gods natural permiſſive wil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that regardes only ſin, which there is no mention of in theſe Textes, neither is it neceſſarily included. Neither can it be meant of Gods moral permiſſive wil, becauſe that was already declared and manifeſt in the Laws of God: for al moral permiſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Gods Legiſlative wil declared in his word. It remains therefore that this phraſe, <hi>If God wil,</hi> be underſtood of Gods effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious wil, whereby al natural motions and ſo the entitative acts of ſin are predetermined.</p>
                     <p>§. 2.

Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with your ſelves, that ye ſold me hither: for God did ſend me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you to preſervelife. Joſeph</hi> here has a double aſpect on his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſin; the one regards their hand in the ſin, which he, out of a noble generous principe of fraternal Love, paſſeth by; the other regards the ſpecial hand of Divine Providence in this their Sin, which he admires and adores, in that it by an efficacious predeterminative Concurſe brought ſo great a good out of ſo great an evil; which no finite power could do: men may make good uſe of what is in it ſelf good, but who can bring ſo great good out of ſo great evil, but a God omniſcient and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? (1) Let us remarque their Sin in ſelling <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and of what a black Idea it was. [1] It ſprang from Hatred, yea a deliberate rooted hatred, as <hi>Gen. 37. 4.

[5] That this ſin was of a very crimſon bloudy guilt is evident by their own Convictions and Confeſſions, when God began to awaken their Conſciences, as it is conjectured about fourteen years after, <hi>Gen. 42. 22.

Yea, [3] <hi>Joſeph</hi> addes <hi>v. 8. So now it was not you that ſent me hither, but God,</hi> &amp;c.

You ſent me out of Hatred and Malice; but did not God ſend me out of great Love and pitie both to me and you? And what could be ſpoken more emphatically to illuſtrate and demonſtrate Gods efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous predeterminative concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin than this, <hi>It was not you that ſent me hither, but God?</hi> Why doth he uſe this manner of ſpeech? was it not they that ſold him?

A Divine of name among us, gives this replie to our Argument, That the <hi>Venditio activa, the active Vendition of Joſeph was not willed by God, but only paſſiva, the paſſive, or effect and conſequents; which are only mentioned in the Text.</hi> I muſt confeſs this anſwer gives me ſome amazement, but no difficultie to anſwer it. For, (1) What this Reverend Author means by his <hi>paſſive Vendition</hi> I cannot divine: I know that in the Ariſtotelean Scholes Action and Paſſion have been really diſtinguiſhed and so diſtributed into two diſtinct Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but I think this imaginary diſtinction is now generally hiſs'd out of the Scholes by al awakened Diſputants; yea, how many of thoſe, who are zeloſe Sectators of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in other points, have ſubſcribed the baniſhment of this diſtinction? So that to diſtinguiſh <hi>active Vendition</hi> from <hi>paſſive,</hi> what is it but to diſtinguiſh one and the ſame Act from it ſelf? But (2) grant there be ſuch a diſtinction in Nature, yet is it not moſt apparent, that it can have no place here? Doth not <hi>Joſeph</hi> aſcribe the very <hi>active Vendition</hi> or action of Selling him, unto God? Is it not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57509:33"/>
ſaid <hi>v. 8. So now, it was not you that ſent me hither, but God?</hi> Can this, with any tolerable ſenſe be applied to the <hi>paſſive Vendition,</hi> or the effects and conſequents of the ſelling <hi>Joſeph?</hi> Muſt it not neceſſarily be underſtood of the very ſame active Vendition, which, conſidered in its natural entitative act, they were the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of, but God the principal Agent and Conductor? (3) This Diſtinction of Active and Paſſive Vendition was not indeed forged by the Reverend Author before mentioned, but taken up from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who <hi>de Amiſſ. Grat. l. 12. c.</hi> 11. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth the <hi>Action</hi> of ſelling <hi>Joſeph</hi> and crucifying Chriſt from the <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and grants, <hi>that God willed and decreed the Paſſion, but not the Action, which inferred the Paſſion;</hi> and becauſe the ſaid Author has ſo great an eſtime for <hi>Strangius,</hi> whom he generally follows in this point, I ſhal give him the anſwer which <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, l. 4. c. 11. p.</hi> 772. gives to this diſtinction of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> thus: <q>However it be, in the Text there are two things to be obſerved, [1] That <hi>Joſeph</hi> there cannot diſtinguiſh the Action from the Paſſion, as if the <hi>Paſſion</hi> were to be aſcribed to God, not the <hi>Action:</hi> for it's plainly ſaid and repeted in the Text, according to the Hebraic veritie, <hi>Gen. 45. 5, 7, 8. that God ſent him.</hi> [2] Thence <hi>c.</hi> 50. 20. he doth plainly diſtinguiſh between the good work of God and their evil in the ſame mater, from the diverſitie of the Intention: <hi>You deſigned evil againſt me, but God deſigned that for good</hi>—</q> Then he addes: <q>Here the various operation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident adminiſtration of God is ſeen, that he might bring to paſs what he had preſignified before by the dreams of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> &amp;c.</q> And <hi>p.</hi> 773. he ſubjoins: <q>There is no incommoditie if it be ſaid, that God elected and alſo procured the Vendition of <hi>Joſeph</hi> as a means to the end fore-ordained by him, and that may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not only of <hi>paſſive</hi> Vendition, but alſo of <hi>active,</hi> which truely can never be ſeparated. For if God willed that <hi>Joſeph</hi> be ſold, he willed, that ſome one ſhould ſel him, and that no other ſhould ſel him but his brethren. For neither was that Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition a thing in it ſelf evil, if it be conſidered apart from the vitioſitie and defect of the ſecond Cauſes. Then he concludes: The Permiſſion of God here was not otioſe, but an efficacious operation in the tradition of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſubminiſtration of occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, out of the concurſe which he made both by the direction of al circumſtances, and moderation of the wil of his brethren, that their purpoſe of killing him being changed, they might
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57509:34"/>
do no other than what God intended. And the ſame efficace and force of Divine providence ſhines brightly in working, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, and directing al other things that relate to this Hiſtorie.</q> This Anſwer of <hi>Strangius</hi> to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> I have been the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixe in reciting, (1) becauſe the fore-mentioned Divine of ſo much repute among us makes great uſe of this diſtinction touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>active and paſſive vendition</hi> or <hi>crucifixion,</hi> endeavoring thereby to ſolve al our Arguments from the vendition of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion of Chriſt; whereas <hi>Strangius,</hi> one of his own partie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectes it as ſpurious and frivolous. (2) Becauſe the conceſſions of <hi>Strangius</hi> in this his Anſwer to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> do indeed give a mortal wound to his own cauſe: For if the active vendition of <hi>Joſeph</hi> was from Gods efficacious providence and wil decreeing the ſame, then actions intrinſecally evil are as to their entitative act or ſubſtrate mater naturally conſidered from God, albeit their moral vitioſitie is to be aſcribed to no one but the ſinner.</p>
                     <p>2. I now paſſe on to demonſtrate, That God doth predefine, or<note place="margin">2. Arg. from the Crucifixion of Chriſt.</note> foreordain and predetermine ſuch natural actions whereunto ſin is neceſſarily annexed, from the <hi>Crucifixion of Chriſt.</hi> And the Textes that confirme this part of our demonſtration are ſo great and illuſtrious, that I cannot but greatly wonder how any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that aſſentes to the veracitie and authoritie of Scripture, can evade the evidence thereof, or diſſent from our Hypotheſis. (1) I ſhal take the Scriptures as they lie in order, and begin with <hi>Mat.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 24.</note> 26. 24. <hi>The Son of man goeth, as it is written of him; but wo unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed.</hi> [1] Note here that Chriſts death was <hi>infallibly predicted</hi> or <hi>foretold:</hi> ſo much, <hi>as it is written of him,</hi> neceſſarily infers. Now how could the death of Chriſt be infallibly predicted, if it were not predefined and preor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by God? Yea, if the death of Chriſt were not neceſſarily predefined and preordained by God, how could God infallibly foreknow the ſalvation of any one elect ſoul, which neceſſarily dependes on the death of Chriſt? So that it remains moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the death of Chriſt was predefined and foreordained by God, and that in every the leaſt circumſtance thereof: the whole ſeries of intentions and actions in <hi>Judas</hi>'s betraying his Lord, and the Jews malitioſe and bloudy crucifying of him was predefined and preordained by God. [2] Hence alſo it follows, that al the bloudy contrivements, barbarous and cruel executions, with al the particular circumſtances in the betraying and crucifying of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57509:34"/>
Chriſt were predetermined by God. Thus much reaſon ſtrongly evinceth, and <hi>Strangius</hi> with others grant, that eternal predefini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or predeſtination, and predetermination in time are parallel and commenſurate each to other: whatever is eternally prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined or preordained by God is predetermined by him in time. Indeed if we wil take the true Idea of Divine <hi>Predetermination,</hi> what is it but the eternal act of the Divine wil, whereby God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defined or preordained al perſons, actions, and effects to exiſte in ſuch or ſuch a period of time? So that, to ſpeake truth, prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition and predetermination differ not really and originally as to their active principe; albeit we may, out of compliance with the Scholes, put this difference between them, by underſtanding <hi>Predefinition, Preordination,</hi> or <hi>Predeſtination</hi> of the eternal active Decree of God, and <hi>Predetermination</hi> of the execution of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or its <hi>paſſive Attingence</hi> in regard of the effect. But take predetermination in what ſenſe you pleaſe, it muſt neceſſarily be applied to the Crucifixion of Chriſt and al the moſt minute cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances thereof. And ſo much indeed is implied in thoſe words, <hi>The Son of man goeth,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Where? or to what? Surely <hi>to die,</hi> and how? without al peradventure, as efficaciouſly conducted, moved, yea predetermined by the Divine wil. There was not the leaſt ſtep he took to the Croſſe, the leaſt intention, action, or circumſtance in the whole complexe or ſyſteme of Chriſts Crucifixion, as wel active as paſſive, but was predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God. But [3] note alſo hence, that this Crucifixion of Chriſt, although it were predefined and predetermined by God, yet this Divine predefinition and predetermination did not at al diminiſh the guilt of thoſe bloudy inſtruments, who had their hands embrued in that immaculate blood. This is particularly ſpecified in thoſe words: <hi>but wo unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed. Judas</hi> neither did nor could juſtly plead Divine preordination or predetermination, as an excuſe for his treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. No, his own conſcience told him, that he had voluntarily, yea malitioſely betrayed innocent bloud: neither could the Jews plead the ſame, in as much as their own malitioſe and bloudy wils were as deeply engaged in this Crucifixion, as if there had been no predetermination, which doth no way diminiſh the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the wil. Hence, [4] it is moſt evident, that this Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion of our Lord was <hi>a ſin intrinſecally evil.</hi> For was there not a world of enmitie and hatred of God in it? Did there not
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57509:35"/>
much blaſphemie attend their wicked deeds? Is not the ſhedding innocent bloud, yea the <hi>bloud of God,</hi> as it is ſtiled, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. a ſin intrinſecally evil? And doth not this ſufficiently demonſtrate, that the ſubſtrate mater of an act intrinſecally evil is predefined and predetermined by God?</p>
                     <p>(2) Another Texte that evidently demonſtrates the Crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt to be <hi>predefined</hi> and <hi>predetermined</hi> by God, is <hi>Luke</hi> 22.<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 22.</note> 22. <hi>And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined; but wo unto that man by whom he is betrayed.</hi> This Text is the ſame, and refers to the ſame paſſage with that before of <hi>Matthew,</hi> yet with this difference; <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>As it is written of him;</hi> but <hi>Luke, As it was determined;</hi> which puts it out of al dout, <hi>that Chriſts crucifixion was determined or predetermined by God.</hi> And for the more ful explication and demonſtration hereof, we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marque, that <hi>Luke</hi> being a Phyſician, was moſt intimely verſed in the Greek Tongue: for a Phyſician in thoſe days was of little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, if not wel acquainted with the Grecanic Monuments rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to medicine.

Yea, we have for this a great conceſſion of <hi>Strangius, lib. 3. cap. 13. pag. 665. But that the workes of Chriſt, ſpecially his Paſſion and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary death were abſolutely predetermined by God is manifeſt from Scripture, Luk. 22. 22.

Evaſion.</note> pietie evades thus: [Chriſts crucifixion] <q>was a thing which Gods hand and counſel had determined before to be done, <hi>Act. 4. 28. i. e.</hi> foreſeeing wicked hands would be promt and ready for this tragic enterpriſe, his ſovereign power and wiſe counſel concurred with his foreknowledge, ſo only, and not with leſſe latitude, to define or determine the bounds and limits of that malignitie, than to let it procede to this execution. And to deliver him up (not by any formal reſignation or ſurrender, as we wel know, but permitting him) thereunto. Though the ſame phraſe of <hi>delivering him,</hi> hath elſewhere another notion of aſſigning or appointing him to be a propitiation for the ſins of men, by dying; which was done by mutual agreement between both the parties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> This replie of this learned pious Divine (ſo far as I can penetrate and underſtand it, which ſeems involved under much obſcuritie) may be reſolved into the following parts. (1) He makes Gods preſcience or foreſeeing the crucifixion of Chriſt by wicked hands, to procede or go before the concurrence and determination of Gods wiſe counſel or predefinition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Wherein he fals in with the Jeſuites <hi>middle Science,</hi> making Gods preſcience precedent to his predefinition or decree, and ſo dependent only on the mutable wil of men as to the act of ſin; which he elſewhere ſeems to intimate: whereas the Scripture,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57509:38"/>
which he refers to, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 23. makes the foreknowledge of Chriſts crucifixion ſubſequent to the predifinition of his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Counſel or Decree. And certainly al the wit of man ſummed up in one cannot conceive or demonſtrate, how God ſhould have a certain preſcience of Chriſts crucifixion, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendes wholly on the contingent uncertain wil of man, and not on the determinate counſel of his own wil. (2) He makes Gods determinate counſel or hand <hi>only to determine the bounds and limits of that malignitie,</hi> &amp;c. As if the bounding and limiting of the malignitie, and not the ſubſtrate mater or act itſelf entitatively conſidered were from God. Whereas the Text ſaith categori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, <hi>That the hand and counſel of God predefined and predetermined whatever thoſe wicked hands of theirs executed.</hi> (3) He gives us a new Gloſſe or Paraphraſe on that phraſe <hi>delivering him, Act.</hi> 2. 23. as if it implied only an <hi>aſſigning or appointing him to be a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. But how little this gloſſe wil accord with the ſenſe of theſe Texts is evident. For that aſſigning and appointing him to be a propitiation was immanent and eternal in the Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, but the <hi>delivering</hi> him here is meant of his being delivered into the hands of thoſe that crucified him, and that according to the determinate counſel of God.</p>
                     <p>3. We come now to the more plauſible ſubterfuges of <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Strangius'<hi>s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions.</hi>
                        </note> whereby he endeavors to evade the evidence of thoſe Texts, which mention Gods predetermining the crucifixion of our Lord. He anſwers, <hi>lib. 3. cap. 4. pag.</hi> 573. thus: <q>The occiſion and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion of Chriſt, alſo the kind of death were from God: and as they were from God, they were good and greatly glorioſe, and properly the means to procure our ſalvation: and God is deſervedly judged the Cauſe and Author of them, <hi>Who by his determinate counſel and precognition delivered his Son to them, whom with wicked hands they killed on the croſſe, Act.</hi> 2. 23. Here truly in the ſame work the good action of God is diſtinguiſhed from their evil action: therefore their wickedneſſe and malice was not from God; neither was it willed or predefined by God, who cannot be ſaid to be the Cauſe and Author of any ſin. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeaking abſolutely, the occiſion of Chriſt was not ſin; (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe God ſhould be the Author of ſin:) as to kil a man is not ſin. And truly if God had commanded men to kil Chriſt, and they out of conſcience to that command had obeyed God, they had not ſinned. But to proſecute Chriſt out of hatred and il-wil is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57509:39"/>
intrinſecally evil, neither can that be any way wel done, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Obſerve here (1) he grants that the crucifixion of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> with al its natural circumſtances entitatively conſidered were from God, as the God of nature, and ſo naturally good: yea, that they were morally good and greatly glorioſe as means to procure our ſalvation; and therefore <hi>God is deſervedly judged the cauſe and author of them,</hi> as <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 23. And (2) we denie with him, that the wickedneſſe and malice of thoſe acts was from God. (3) He alſo grants, <hi>That the occiſion or killing of Chriſt conſidered abſolutely was not ſin.</hi> Whereunto we retort, That neither the hatred of Chriſt conſidered abſolutely without relation to its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is ſin. But, (4) he concludes: <hi>But to proſecute Chriſt out of hatred and il-wil is intrinſecally evil,</hi> &amp;c. Whence we argue, That the crucifying of Chriſt was a ſin intrinſecally evil, and yet as to its ſubſtrate mater and entitative acts from God. For did not the Jews proſecute Chriſt out of hatred and malice, yea malice blowen up to the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt in ſome of them? And was not, in this good work of crucifixion, the good action of God, and the evil action of the Jews the ſame as to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate mater or natural entitative act? This pincheth <hi>Strangius</hi> cloſely, and therefore he ſeems to make the natural entitative act of God diſtinct from the natural entitative act of the wicked Jews: For he ſaith, <hi>Here truly in the ſame work the good action of God is diſtinguiſhed from their evil action; and therefore their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and malice was not from God.</hi> Here we grant, [1] his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence or concluſion, <hi>That their malice was not from God.</hi> [2] We thus far alſo grant his Antecedent, That the good action of God, conſidered both naturally and morally, was diſtinguiſhed from their evil action conſidered <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>morally:</hi> for the malice and vitioſitie which formaliſed the action as theirs, is no way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable to Gods act conſidered either naturally or morally. [3] But yet we ſtil avouch, and no way dout but to demonſtrate in its place, that in the crucifixion of Chriſt the act of the wicked Jews conſidered <hi>materially, naturally,</hi> and <hi>entitatively</hi> was one and the ſame with Gods act: So much al theſe Texts clearly evince; ſo much alſo reaſon dictates: For if there were two acts, the one primarily, yea only from the wicked inſtruments, the other from God the prime Efficient, then how could they be ſaid to be the inſtruments of Gods Efficience? Muſt we not then alſo ſuppoſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57509:39"/>
two Crucifixions, one from God, and the other from the Jews? What a world of abſurdities would follow this Hypotheſis, That the action of God in the Crucifixion of Chriſt conſidered <hi>enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively, materially,</hi> and <hi>naturally,</hi> was really diſtinct from the action of the Inſtruments conſidered <hi>entitatively, materially,</hi> and <hi>naturally?</hi> But to conclude, we find an excellent ſolution to al theſe evaſions and ſubterfuges in <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> Epiſt. 48. <hi>ad Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Quum Pater tradiderit Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium, &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus Corpus ſuum, &amp; Judas Dominum, cur in hac traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Deus eſt juſtus &amp; homo reus, niſi quia in re una quam fecerunt, cauſa non eſt una ob quam fecerunt. <hi>Auguſt.

                        </note> thus: <hi>When the Father delivered his Son, and Chriſt his own Bodie, and Judas his Lord, why in this Tradition is God juſt and man guilty, but becauſe in one and the ſame thing which they did, the cauſe was not one and the ſame.</hi> A ſolution ſufficient to ſatisfie any ſober mind: Wherein note, (1) That the act of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſo of crucifying Chriſt, was one and the ſame entita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and phyſically conſidered both in regard of God and the ſinner. (2) That the difference ſprang from the Cauſes: God delivered his Son to Death, thereby to bring about the greateſt good that Sinners could wiſn for, their Salvation; but <hi>Judas</hi> and the malitioſe Jews delivered the Lord of Glorie to death, with <hi>wicked hands,</hi> out of an avaricious humor, malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence, (3) The Action was moſt juſt and glorioſe on Gods part, but moſt unjuſt and wicked on the Sinners part. This anſwer of <hi>Auguſtin</hi> is ſo great, that it might ſerve to anſwer al the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt our Hypotheſis, were not men bent to cavil againſt the truth.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. I come now to a third Head of Scriptural Arguments, namely ſuch, <hi>wherein God is ſaid to make uſe of wicked Inſtruments for the puniſhing or afflicting his people in ſuch a way, wherein the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments could not but contract guilt.</hi> I ſhal divide this Head in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two members; (1) <hi>Such Scriptures, wherein God is ſaid to make uſe of wicked Inſtruments for the puniſhing his ſinful people.</hi> (2) <hi>Such as mention Gods afflicting his righteous People by ſinful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. We ſhal begin with ſuch Scriptures <hi>wherein God is ſaid to</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Gods puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſinful People by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Inſtruments.</note> 
                        <hi>make uſe of wicked Inſtruments for the puniſhment of his ſinful people.</hi> So <hi>Eſa. 10. 5, 6. O Aſſyrian, the rod of mine anger, I will ſend him againſt an hypocritical Nation.</hi> The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> is ſent by God as his rod to puniſh his ſinful people; and every ſtroke of this rod was<note place="margin">Eſa. 10. 5, 6, 7.</note> from God; his hand guiding, ordering, and actuating the rod in al its motions. And yet, how much ſin was there committed on the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> part in puniſhing <hi>Iſrael?</hi> How little did he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57509:40"/>
to ſerve God herein? were not Pride and Ambition the main ſprings of his action? Thence it's added <hi>v. 7. Howbeit he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo,</hi> &amp;c. whence <hi>v.</hi> 12. God threatens to puniſh him for his ſin. So that it's evident, this <hi>ſending</hi> of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> by God, mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 6. cannot be meant of any <hi>legal permiſſion</hi> or <hi>commiſſion</hi> given him by God, but of the ſecret efficacious predeterminative concurſe and Providence of God, ordering what ſhould come to paſs. So <hi>Jer. 16. 16. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jerem. 16. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>I wil ſend for many fiſhers, ſaith the Lord, and they ſhal fiſh them, and after wil I ſend for many hunters, and they ſhal hunt them from every mountain,</hi> &amp;c. Note, (1) That theſe words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not a promiſſe but threat, begun <hi>v.</hi> 9. This is evident from <hi>v.</hi> 17. (2) By <hi>Fiſhers</hi> and <hi>Hunters</hi> in the general we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand enemies to the Jews. <hi>To fiſh and to hunt,</hi> is to take and deſtroy. War has a great reſſemblance with fiſhing and hunting, which is a kind of war againſt beſtes; as war is a kind of fiſhing and hunting of men: whence <hi>Nimrod</hi> the firſt Warrier after the Floud, is ſtiled <hi>Gen. 10. 9. a mighty hunter,</hi> i. e. of men. Ay, but more particularly, (3) Who are theſe <hi>fiſhers?</hi> Why, as it is ſuppoſed, the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who are called <hi>Fiſhers,</hi> Eſa. 19. 8. (4) And who are the <hi>Hunters?</hi> The <hi>Babylonians,</hi> as it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſaid: But, (5) Who is it that <hi>ſends</hi> for theſe Fiſhers and Hunters? It is God, <hi>I wil ſend,</hi> &amp;c. (6) Why doth God ſend for them? To puniſh his ſinful People, and that by thoſe very Nations in whom they had ſo much confided, and to whom they had ſo much conformed, as is intimated <hi>v.</hi> 17. And what more juſt, than that Profeſſors ſhould be puniſhed by ſuch Inſtruments, as have been the ground of their confidence, and the exemplars of their ſins? (7) How doth God ſend for theſe Fiſhers and Hunters? Surely, not by any legal Act or formal Commiſſion given to them, but <hi>providentially,</hi> by exciting their minds, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying their wils, and drawing forth, yea determining the ſame to the ſubſtrate mater or material entitative act of afflicting the Jews, whereunto there was much malice, murder, and hatred of God and his People annexed. Yea, God did not only ſend <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar</hi> to afflict <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but alſo give him a reward for his ſervice; as <hi>Jerem. 27. 6. And now have I given al theſe lands into the hands of Nebuchadnezar the King of Babylon, my ſervant.</hi> God gives him the neighbor Nations as a reward for his ſervice againſt <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The like <hi>Jer.</hi> 43. 10. Multitudes of Texts might be

added to ſhew, how God makes uſe of wicked Inſtruments in the puniſhment of his ſinful people, and in a providential way efficaciouſly concurs to and predetermines al their actions ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially and naturally conſidered, and yet is no way the Cauſe or Author of their ſin.</p>

                     <p>Let us now ſee what our Opponents replie to theſe Scriptures and our Arguments drawen thence. <hi>Strangius, l. 4. c. 4. p.</hi> 791. evades the force of this laſt Text thus: <hi>What is ſaid</hi> Pſal. 105. 25. <hi>that God turned their hearts to hate his people, it muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that God did it not by perverting the hearts of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, but by doing good to his people, whence the Egyptians took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of hatred.</hi> (1) We ſay not that God perverted the hearts of the Egyptians; that's the commun odioſe conſequence which our Adverſaries impoſe on us. But, (2) We avouch, that God did more than give occaſion to the Egyptians of hating, by his doing good to his people. Is not this a ſtrange Comment, <hi>God turned their heart to hate his people,</hi> i. e. gave occaſion of hatred, by doing good unto his people? Doth not Gods turning the

Certainly ſuch Comments are very poor eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to elude ſuch clear Texts. As for the other Texts, <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>'s general anſwer <hi>p.</hi> 774, 775. is, <hi>That God is the Cauſe of the act in thoſe ſins, but not of the pravitie of the Inſtruments,</hi> &amp;c. And what do we ſay or deſire more? But yet there lies a ſting in this very conceſſion of his: for he addes, <hi>p. 774.

God hath not abſolutely decreed to permit ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not approve of it. Wherein note, [1] How he doth, with the Pelagians and Arminians, confound Gods <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretive Wil,</hi> with his <hi>Approbative complacential</hi> Wil. [2] We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie not but God approves of al his own Acts; but the Queſtion is touching <hi>objects, Whether God approves of al objects which by his Decretive Wil he decrees to permit?</hi> This we peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and no way dout but to make good our denial in its place.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57509:41"/>
which ariſeth from two cauſes, whereof the one is effective, and the other directive, be aſcribed to both, but in a different reſpect,</hi> &amp;c. This is the commun anſwer, which he and his Sectators give to ſuch Scriptures, which ſpeake Gods immediate hand in the enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative acts of ſin; let us therefore a little examine the force of this anſwer.</p>
                     <p>(1) Take notice, that he allows Gods <hi>Gubernation, Moderation</hi> and <hi>Direction</hi> of the Act whereto ſin is annexed, but not the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi> of the act. This is evident by the Concluſion, wherein he makes the Sinner to be the <hi>effective</hi> cauſe, but God the <hi>directive</hi> only. But I replie, how can God <hi>efficaciouſly Govern, Moderate,</hi> and <hi>Direct</hi> the Act, unleſs he be alſo the effective Cauſe thereof? Take his own inſtance, the ſinful wils of <hi>Abſalom</hi> and <hi>Achitophel,</hi> how is it poſſible, that God ſhould efficaciouſly govern and direct thoſe immanent acts of their ſinful wils, but by influencing their wils, and efficaciouſly predetermining them to act? If God did, as he grants, <hi>efficaciouſly govern, moderate,</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> their ſinful wils in thoſe immanent acts of Luſt, certainly he muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily produce thoſe acts. (2) Neither wil this anſwer at al ſolve the Difficultie: for ſuppoſe we grant, that God doth only effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciouſly govern, moderate, and direct the ſinful act, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the entitative mater thereof, yet this <hi>efficacious directive</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence doth as much make God the Author of ſin, as our <hi>effective predeterminative</hi> concurſe. For Gods efficacious Moderation and Direction of the ſinful act, denotes his efficacious Preſervation of the act, which is as ſinful as the effection or production of the Act. But more of this hereafter, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
                     <p>Another Scripture which ſpeaks Gods immediate predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native<note place="margin">Shimei'<hi>s curſing</hi> David, <hi>how from God.</hi> 2 Sam. 16. 10, 11.</note> concurſe in the entitative act of Sin, is 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 10. where <hi>David</hi> ſaith of <hi>Shimei, That the Lord ſaid unto him, Curſe David.</hi> And <hi>v. 11. Let him curſe; for the Lord hath bidden him.</hi> Now the force of this argument dependes on the explication of this <hi>word</hi> or <hi>command</hi> of God to <hi>Shimei,</hi> which muſt be here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken either <hi>morally,</hi> for a divine precept and injunction, or <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicly</hi> for an efficacious Concurſe and influence. (1) That it cannot be here taken <hi>morally</hi> for a preceptive word, is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; becauſe had God commanded <hi>Shimei</hi> to curſe <hi>David,</hi> he had been the moral cauſe and ſo the Author of his ſin. (2) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it remains, that it be here taken only <hi>phyſicly,</hi> for Gods efficacious Concurſe ſecretly and powerfully inclining and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57509:42"/>
                        <hi>Shimei</hi>'s wil to the entitative act of this curſing. And in this ſenſe the <hi>Word</hi> of God is frequently taken in Scripture, namely, for his efficacious predeterminative concurſe, in the Creation, Conſervation, and Gubernation of things.</p>
                     <p>Now what doth <hi>Strangius</hi> replie to this? Why, <hi>l. 4. c. 4. p.</hi> 786. he ſaith, <hi>That Shimei's Curſings being intrinſecally evil, we may not ſay, that God did move or impel him thereto in a proper manner of ſpeech, neither that Shimei was the Inſtrument of God in theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they were determined to ſuch an object; but only as directed by God to his juſt judgements: and that moſt certain direction of God, with the adminiſtration of Circumſtances and Occaſions was as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</hi> In which Reſponſe note, (1) That he grants, <hi>that Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei his curſing was an action intrinſecally evil:</hi> which is a great conceſſion, and wil clearly overthrow his own Hypotheſis, and prove ours, <hi>That God doth predetermine the wil to the ſubſtrate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of actions intrinſecally evil.</hi> For if <hi>Shimei</hi>'s Curſing was an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on intrinſecally evil, then ſurely ſuch alſo was the Vendition of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and the Crucifixion of our Lord, which were both as to their entitative acts predetermined by God. But (2) he denies, <hi>that Shimei was the Inſtrument of God in theſe actions, as determined to ſuch an object.</hi> In the laſt clauſe of this Antitheſis lies the ſpirit and force of al his objections againſt predetermination to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin; which we intend more fully to examine <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. §. 1. at preſent, we ſay, [1] That <hi>Shimei</hi> was not the inſtrument of any <hi>moral</hi> but <hi>phyſic</hi> influence from God: the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> or <hi>bidding</hi> here ſpecified was not moral but <hi>phyſic</hi> and real: God did not morally command <hi>Shimei</hi> to curſe <hi>David,</hi> but phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicly and naturally incline him to the entitative act of Curſing him; which was as a Precept: this <hi>Strangius</hi> grants in the cloſe as to Gods direction. [2] Hence if we conſider <hi>Shimei</hi>'s curſing as <hi>phyſicly</hi> determined to ſuch an object, it was not <hi>morally</hi> evil but good, and ſo from God: It's true, as it was morally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by <hi>Shimei</hi> the moral Agent to its object <hi>David,</hi> ſo it was intrinſecally evil, but as it was phyſicly or naturally determined by God, for the puniſhment of <hi>David,</hi> ſo it was both naturally and morally good and from God. (3) He placeth the whole of Gods Influence to this act, <hi>in directing his Actions to his juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> &amp;c. To which I anſwer. [1] How could God direct theſe actions of <hi>Shimei;</hi> ſpecially, the immanent acts of his wil, (which were the worſt part of his malediction) but by an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57509:42"/>
predeterminative influence on his wil and its acts? [2] He grants, <hi>that this Direction of God was moſt certain and efficacious:</hi> if ſo, then certainly predeterminative: and if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection be predeterminative, is not Gods concurſe to the ſinful act conſidered materially and entitatively, predeterminative? [3] If Gods directive concurſe be predeterminative, as <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> muſt by his conceſſions grant, wil not thoſe ugly conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he lodes our Hypotheſis with, be al retorted on him? Did not Gods efficacious direction termine on <hi>Shimei</hi>'s curſing as determined to ſuch an object, namely <hi>David?</hi> And was he not the Inſtrument of this efficacious direction?</p>

                        <hi>Baronius, Metaph. S. 8. Diſp. 3. p.</hi> 158. anſwers this Text thus: <hi>To that malediction of Shimei it is anſwered, That God commanded Shimei to curſe David, not by bending his wil, but by opening to him the way to this evil, and by ſhutting it to al other evils,</hi> i. e. <hi>by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to act this only, whenas he was ready for many other evils.</hi> A poor evaſion indeed, and ſuch as if admitted would make the whole Scripture but as a Noſe of Waxe. (1) Doth not <hi>David</hi> ſay categoricly, <hi>that God bid,</hi> [i. e. not morally but phyſicly] <hi>Shimei to curſe?</hi> And what can this implie, but the bending his wil to the ſubſtrate mater, or entitative Act? (2) Can it be imagined, that <hi>David</hi> could mean only a mere otioſe and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative permiſſion, and not an active concurrence to the act it ſelf entitatively conſidered? (3) Doth not <hi>Baronius</hi> confeſs, <hi>that God opened to him the way to this evil?</hi> And if ſo, muſt he not then open <hi>Shimei</hi>'s heart to the mater of it? Did not the main act of malediction ariſe from his wil? And if that were not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the entitative act, would the way to this evil have been ever opened?</p>
                     <p>Again, Gods immediate predeterminative hand in thoſe acts, whereunto ſin is neceſſarily appendent, may be demonſtrated from 2 <hi>Sam. 24. 1. And again the anger of the Lord was kindled</hi>

                        <hi>ſtirred up Saul againſt him, i. e.</hi> efficaciouſly moved him to the enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative act of perſecuting <hi>David.</hi> Thence (2) <hi>Strangius</hi> fearing the ruinous downfal of this refuge flies to another, thus: <hi>But if we follow the commun interpretation, it appears, that the ſame fact is aſcribed to God and Satan; and therefore it muſt be on a different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: and here alſo the varietie in the end and mode makes the unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Juſtice of God to ſhine forth, and the malice of Satan and pravitie of man to diſcover itſelf. For [1] the action of numbering the people was not in itſelf evil. [2] Divines diſtinguiſh between tentation of probation and ſeduction. [3] Here the ſane things concur, which were before explicated of the ſame ſenſe, whereby God is ſaid to incline to evil, namely the permiſſion and laxation of the reins to Satan, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of occaſions and irritaments, impediments being removed, and the ſuſpenſion of Divine Grace: which things concurring with the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie of nature, ſin neceſſarily follows.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(1) We grant, that the ſame fact is aſcribed to God and Satan on different accounts: God put the thought entitatively conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into <hi>Davids</hi> heart, but Satan ſtirred up his heart to the act of numbering the people; God in judgement gave over <hi>David</hi> to this ſin, that it ſhould be at this time when God was angry with <hi>Iſrael:</hi> There is a ſpecial providence of God even in the ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of luſts in the hearts of his own people. Thus alſo in the wicked; who put that thought of murder conſidered materially into the heart of <hi>Eſau, When my father is dead I wil ſlay my brother Jacob?</hi> Was it not from God? Whence came that motion into the heart of <hi>Judas</hi> to betray Chriſt, with al the circumſtances ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially conſidered referring thereto? were they not from God? Thus here, God put the entitative thought of numbering the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into the heart of <hi>David,</hi> albeit Satan ſtirred it up; and God was the Orderer, albeit Satan the Abettor and in ſome ſenſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it: for God is only the prime phyſic cauſe of the natural
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57509:43"/>
entitie, but Satan the moral cauſe or Author of the vitioſitie: again, the concurſe of God to the natural entitative act is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, efficacious, and predeterminative, but Satans concurſe only mediate, objective, and ſuaſive, though with more or leſſe degrees of moral efficacitie, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. Again, (2) we grant, that the different ends and modes of operating make Gods unſpotted Juſtice and mans pravitie to ſhine forth. (3) We are glad, that <hi>Strangius</hi> wil grant, <hi>the action of numbering the people not to be in itſelf evil.</hi> Whence, by a paritie of reaſon, we argue, That no action, though never ſo intrinſecally evil, is in itſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> as conſidered in its phyſic entitative act, and according to its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate mater, ſinful: for certainly if <hi>Davids</hi> numbering the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which was a ſin attended with ſo much pride, vain-glorie, and confidence in an arme of fleſh, with other aggravations, which ſo greatly provoked God, were not in itſelf evil, no other ſin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in its mere entitative and phyſic act is ſuch. Yea, I as yet ſee no reaſon why this ſin of <hi>David</hi> conſidered in its individual circumſtances and moral relation to its object and principes, may not be eſtimed a ſin intrinſecally evil, as wel as <hi>Shimei</hi>'s curſing <hi>David.</hi> But (4) <hi>Strangius</hi>'s ſummary concluſion, <hi>That Gods concurſe to</hi> Davids <hi>ſin was only an idle permiſſion, laxation of the reins to Satan, and oblation of occaſions, with ſuſpenſion of Divine Grace,</hi> is very contradictory both to the letter and mind of the Text, which ſaith poſitively, <hi>that God moved,</hi> or <hi>excited,</hi> and <hi>ſtirred up the mind</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> not <hi>morally,</hi> but <hi>phyſicly,</hi> to the entitative act of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering the people. Certainly, when the Scripture ſpeakes ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegoricly and poſitively of <hi>Gods moving the wil to its act,</hi> to reſtrain ſuch moving influences and cauſalitie, only to mere <hi>idle permiſſion,</hi> or <hi>objective oblation of occaſions,</hi> or <hi>negative ſuſpenſions</hi> of Divine Grace, what is this but to make the Scripture contradictory to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or affirmation and negation applicable to the ſame words? How eaſily might an Atheiſt hence take advantage to elude al Scripture!</p>
                     <p>But to paſſe on to other Texts, that clearly expreſſe Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate predeterminative concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acts. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 31. the Lord ſaith, <hi>I wil rend the kingdome</hi>

                     <p>Now let us examine what reſponſe <hi>Strangius</hi> gives hereto: <hi>l. 4. c. 4. p.</hi> 793. rejecting the anſwer of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> (which to me is as good as his, yea not really different) he anſwers, <hi>It is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely but that</hi> Jeroboam <hi>and</hi> Jehu, <hi>albeit in taking the Kingdome they ſinned not as to the thing itſelf and ſubſtance of the act, becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by Gods-command, yet in manner of acting, as they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane men, they variouſly ſinned by mingling their own ambition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved affections with the worke of God.</hi> Thence he concludes, <hi>That whatever their ſins were, yet the juſtice of God ſufficiently ſhines forth in the whole of this Adminiſtration, becauſe God uſed both the Kings and people in this worke only as inſtruments to execute his juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To give a brief replie hereto, it is very evident, that al that<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> 
                        <hi>Strangius</hi> hath given us in anſwer to theſe Texts, doth but more confirme us in the true ſenſe we give of them. For (1) it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and <hi>Jehu,</hi> with the Revolters their Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſinned not only in the <hi>mode</hi> or manner, but in the very <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of their acts: For is not High treaſon againſt a lawful King an act ſinful as to its ſubſtance? And were not <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> both lawful Kings? Was not <hi>Rehoboam Solomons</hi> Son, whom God made King? It's true, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> had private prophetic Inſtructions and Unctions, but yet thoſe gave them no real title before the people, but only ſecret intimations what God would in his providence bring to paſſe. <hi>David</hi> had a promiſe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and alſo Divine Unction; and yet he confeſſeth, that God gave him no actual title to the Kingdom in the eyes of men; but he ſtil ownes <hi>Saul</hi> as his Soverain King, and the Lords Anointed: and ſo ought <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> their lawful Soverains, til God had given them a legal title before men. (2) But ſuppoſe <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi>'s ſin were only in the <hi>manner,</hi> not in the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the act, yet certain it is, that the peoples ſin, before God had declared his ſoverain wil to them, was high Treaſon, and ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially evil. (3) Yea further, grant that they al ſinned but in the <hi>mode,</hi> not in the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of their acts, yet whether the act
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57509:44"/>
be ſubſtantially or modally only ſinful, it comes al to one in this caſe of Divine concurſe and predetermination: For if God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the ſubſtrate mater of acts modally ſinful; why may he not as wel concur to the ſubſtrate mater of acts ſubſtantially ſinful? Do not our Adverſaries hereby, according to their Principes, make God the Author of <hi>modal</hi> ſins? Or, is not the entitative act of modal and ſubſtantial ſins the ſame as to kind, namely a real phyſic or natural good? and therefore if God concur to the one, why not alſo to the other? Aſſuredly, the moſt refined Wits wil never find out a ſufficient diſparitie between acts <hi>modally</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantially</hi> ſinful, ſo as to allow God an efficacious concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of the one, but not of the other. (4) <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> grants in the cloſe, <hi>That God uſed both theſe Kings and their mutinous Adherents as inſtruments in this worke, to execute his just judgements,</hi> &amp;c. Did he ſo indeed? Did he not then alſo make uſe of their politic contrivements, ambitioſe wils, and rebellious affections as inſtruments in this worke? And if ſo, did not God alſo move, excite, applie, yea predetermine their wils to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate mater of their traitorous rebellious deſignes and exploits? Do not al theſe conſequences hang together in an indiſſoluble chain of invict Reaſon? To cloſe up theſe arguments with that of <hi>Calvin, Inſtitut. lib. 1. cap. 18. §. 4. pag.</hi> 78. <q>But now how it may be from God, and governed by his ſecret providence, which men wickedly undertake, we have an illuſtrious document in the Election of King <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> in which the madneſſe and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritie of the people is ſeverely condemned, becauſe they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the order eſtabliſhed by God, and perfidioſely departed from the familie of <hi>David:</hi> and yet we know, that God would have him anointed; whence in the words of <hi>Hoſea, c.</hi> 8. 4. there appears a kind of repugnance; becauſe God there complains, <hi>That that Kingdome was erected contrary to his wil and knowlege;</hi> and yet <hi>c.</hi> 13. 11. he declares, <hi>That he gave Jeroboam to be King in his wrath.</hi> How can theſe things agree? Thence he concludes, <hi>We ſee therefore that God, who nilled the perfidie or treacherie, yet, for another end, juſtly willed the defection.</hi>
                        </q> And if God juſtly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the defection, he alſo juſtly moved and predetermined them to the ſubſtrate mater thereof; for predetermination anſwers adequately to God predefinition or abſolute volition, as <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> grants.</p>

of this ſinful act. (2) As for the command of God, <hi>verſ. 22. Go forth and do ſo,</hi> it can in no ſober ſenſe be underſtood of a mere permiſſion.

Is not lying a ſin intrinſecally evil? Should not the holy God then, according to this ſenſe, be the Author of a ſin intrinſecally evil? Neither can it be meant of a mere ſpeculative phyſic permiſſion, as to the ſubſtrate mater: for it's expreſſed in a terme of the moſt active import, <hi>the Lord hath put,</hi>

This Divine precept therefore muſt denote an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious real influence, ſuch as predetermined thoſe lying ſpirits to the ſubſtrate mater of their ſin. Yea, (3) is there not ſo much included in the laſt clauſe of <hi>Strangius</hi>'s replie, wherein he grants, <hi>This Divine precept to be taken for the efficacious direction of God, for the execution of his juſt judgement?</hi> Now what is Gods efficacious direction, but a part of his efficacious predeterminative concurſe?

purpoſe, that the Adherents of Antichriſt ſhould give up their Power and Kingdome to him; and thence he, by an efficacious concurſe, predetermined their wils to the ſubſtrate mater of thoſe acts, whereunto ſin was annexed, for the glorifying of his Juſtice, on Antichriſt, and his power and mercie towards his afflicted Churches.</p>
                     <p>Now let us examine the ſubterfuges men ſhelter themſelves under, to avoid the force of this Text. A reverend Divine of name among us replies thus: <q>(1) He that readeth Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> Expoſition applying this to <hi>Alaricus</hi> ſacking <hi>Rome,</hi> with the effects, wil ſee that the very <hi>ſubject</hi> is ſo dubious and dark, as not fit to found ſuch a Doctrine on. (2) It was the effect of ſin that God willed, and not the ſin. (3) He is not ſaid to put the ſin into their hearts,—but only <hi>to do his pleaſure, and agree to give up,</hi> &amp;c. which he could moſt eaſily do by putting many good and lawful thoughts into their hearts, which with their own ſins, would have that effect, which he willed: if a thief have a wil to rob, God may put it into his heart to go ſuch or ſuch a way, where a wicked man to be puniſhed wil be in his way.</q> Thus that reverend Divine.</p>
                     <p>In anſwer hereto we ſay, That whatever mens Comments may be, yet certainly the ſubject is not ſo dark, but carries evidence enough with it, that it can be meant of no other than of the ten hornes, which give up their Kingdome to the Antichriſtian Beſte. (2) Whereas he ſaith, <hi>It was the effect of their ſin that God willed, and not the ſin,</hi> this ſeems contradictory to the very letter as wel as to the mind of the words: for it's ſaid, [1] <hi>God hath put it into their hearts, i. e.</hi> not only the effect, but the very material entita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive act. Then [2] <hi>to fulfil his wil,</hi> i. e. <hi>his decree,</hi> ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> here muſt note. Now God decreed the very act, and not only the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and therefore his predetermining concurſe muſt alſo reach the very act: according to that great theologic Axiome allowed by <hi>Strangius</hi> and others, <hi>That predetermination neceſſarily follows predefinition, or Gods abſolute Decree.</hi> Yea [3] it's ſaid, <hi>That God put into their hearts, not only to fulfil his wil, but alſo to agree and give their Kingdome to the Beſte. To agree, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, unanimouſly to make one Edict or Decree, and that at a Council-table.</hi> Which clearly denotes a deliberate, firme, unanimous conſent of giving up their power to the Beſte. And doth not this clearly ſpeak the act of their ſin, as wel as the effect? And is not this act
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57509:46"/>
as to its entitative mater, ſaid to be put into their hearts by God? So much alſo the next Verbe <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> importes, namely their delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate free donation of their power, wherein the formalitie of their ſin lies: and yet this very act, as to its ſubſtrate mater, is ſaid to be from God. Whence (3) whereas he ſaith, <hi>God is not ſaid to put the ſin into their hearts,—but only to do his pleaſure and agree,</hi> &amp;c. I eaſily grant, [1] That God did not put the ſin formally conſidered into their heart; <hi>for God temtes no one to ſin;</hi> but yet he put the material entitative act of the ſin into their heart. For wherein lay the malignitie of their ſin, but in this, that they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly and peremtorily agreed or decreed to give up their power to the Beſte? And is not this very act, entitatively conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, ſaid to be put into them by God? And was it not alſo Gods <hi>pleaſure</hi> or <hi>ſtated Decree,</hi> that they ſhould thus agree? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And [2] whereas he ſaith, <hi>God could make them do his pleaſure moſt eaſily, by putting many good and lawful thoughts into their hearts,</hi> &amp;c. is not this a very ſlender evaſion? what the leaſt mention is there of any ſuch thing in the Text? Yea, is it not expreſſely ſaid, <hi>That God put into their hearts to agree,</hi> &amp;c? And did not the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſin lie in this maligne bloudy agreement? Albeit the holy God be ſufficiently vindicated from the leaſt imputation of any hand in this conſpiracie, in that he decreed and produced on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the entitative act, not the vitioſitie. [3] His inſtance or ſimilitude from <hi>the Thief that hath a wil to rob,</hi> &amp;c. is extreme lame and nothing to the purpoſe; for it's evidently ſaid in the Text, that God not only concurred to the externe acts and effects, but <hi>that he put it into their hearts to agree,</hi> &amp;c. So that the very wil and conſent, entitatively conſidered, was from God.</p>
                     <p>Let us now examine what <hi>Strangius</hi> replies to this, who <hi>lib. 4. cap. 10. pag.</hi> 855. acknowlegeth this Text <hi>Rev. 17. 17. to be meant of the ten hornes giving their power to the Beſte;</hi> but yet ſo as that if we underſtand the words (1) <hi>of Gods putting it into their minds to agree,</hi> &amp;c. <q>then the ſenſe muſt be no other than, 2 <hi>Theſ. 2. 11. Rom.</hi> 1. 28. and like places, which ſpeak of Gods delivering men up to a reprobate mind, and ſending the efficace of error, that they might ſerve Antichriſt. And here the diſtinction muſt always concur, when in the ſame action ſin and puniſhment concur, that not mens ſins, but Gods judgements and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt be aſcribed to God. In this ſenſe God is ſaid <hi>to excite, impel, and incline to ſin.</hi>
                        </q> Before we paſſe on to <hi>Strangius</hi>'s
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57509:47"/>
ſecond anſwer, let us a little examine this. [1] He grants, that God judicially may and doth concur to ſin, yea <hi>excite, impel,</hi> and <hi>incline men to it.</hi> And doth not this fully overthrow his own Hypotheſis and confirme ours? For if God in judgement <hi>impel, excite,</hi> and <hi>incline</hi> men to one ſin, as a puniſhment of another, is he not then as much the Author of ſin in this way, as in ours? [2] How doth God judicially puniſh one ſin by another, but, to uſe his own words, by delivering ſuch up to a reprobate mind and the efficace of error? And if ſo, then muſt not the ſubſtrate acts of ſuch judicial dereliction be from God? Of this hereafter, §. 6.</p>
                     <p>But (2) I paſſe on to his ſecond anſwer, whereon he ſeems to lay the moſt weight, though indeed moſt feeble: <q>But, ſaith he, becauſe thoſe words, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 17. are immediately ſubjoined to <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. and are connected therewith by the rational Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which points out the reaſon of that which next follows, namely, that thoſe ten Kings having changed their opinion, ſhould deſtroy the Whore and Antichriſt, it ſeems to me more commodious, if in that <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. there be a reaſon given of this famoſe change, that they who were before the friends and vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of Antichriſt, ſhould be afterwards enemies and adverſaries to him, namely, becauſe God hath put this into their heart. And the firſt words of <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. ſufficiently accord to this Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition—But what is ſubjoined, <hi>That they might give their Kingdome to the Beſte, until the word of God ſhould be conſummate,</hi> I ſhould think ought to be expounded negatively, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> Thus <hi>Strangius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A ſtrange comment indeed! let us a little inquire into it. (1) How infirm is his argument from the rational particle <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to make what follows, <hi>the fulfilling of Gods wil,</hi> to refer only to the deſtroying of Antichriſt? whereas the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſeems rather to refer to the whole verſe, and more particularly to the laſt clauſe, <hi>until the Word of God ſhal be fulfilled;</hi> and ſo it notes, <hi>that God put it into their hearts to fulfil his Wil,</hi> [1] In agreeing to give their Kingdom to the Beſte, and [2] When <hi>the words of God were fulfilled,</hi> i. e. Antichriſts reign expired, then <hi>to hate the Whore,</hi> &amp;c. And this makes the whole contexture of the words natural and evident. So that <hi>v.</hi> 17. is not only a reaſon of the change, mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 16. but alſo an account of the whole ſeries of their actions both whiles friends to, and enemies againſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57509:47"/>
(2) As for what is ſubjoined <hi>v. 17. That they might give their Kingdome to the Beſte,</hi> I cannot but admire with what ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of reaſon <hi>Strangius</hi> can underſtand this <hi>negatively,</hi> as if they ſhould not give their Kingdom to the Beſte: certainly if ſuch gloſſes ſhould be admitted, we might eaſily find in Scripture ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuges for the worſt Hereſies and Immoralities? Why may not the moſt profane debauched wretch, when he is preſſed with thoſe Commands, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adulterie, Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> &amp;c. replie, that theſe Scriptures muſt not be taken negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but affirmatively, <hi>Thou ſhalt commit adulterie,</hi> &amp;c? But <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> ſaw ful wel, that the affirmative ſenſe of thoſe words, <hi>That they might give their Kingdome to the Beſte,</hi> would quite ſubvert his forced ſenſe of the foregoing words, and therefore he ſaw no way left, but to ſecure himſelf by reducing this later affirmative clauſe to a negative, though contrary to the expreſſe letter and mind of the words. But (3) being after al his gloſſes ſenſible of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and invaliditie of this reſponſe, he <hi>p.</hi> 856. flies again to his old refuge, telling us, <q>That if any ſhal think this expoſition of the laſt member not ſufficient, but that beyond it there muſt be alſo ſignified, <hi>that God did put it into their hearts to give their Kingdome to the Beſte,</hi> I have no mind to contend about this mater, ſithat the ſenſe is ſufficiently ſane, which ever way the words be underſtood. In evil works God is not the cauſe of the moral evil, but of the ſubſtrate act and puniſhment, or Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is annected to the ſin; but in good works, not only of the ſubſtrate act, but alſo of the moral Bonitie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> Who of us denies this? would our Adverſaries but ſtick here, how ſoon would our Controverſie be ended? But here lies the ſting, even in this plauſible conceſſion, <hi>Strangius</hi> with the reſt would fain perſwade us, that there are ſome acts of ſin ſo intrinſecally evil, as that you cannot ſeparate the phyſic natural act from its moral Vitioſitie.</p>
                     <p>§. 5. We deſcend now to ſuch Scriptures as mention Gods<note place="margin">Gods efficacious Permiſſion of Sin.</note> 
                        <hi>efficacious Permiſſion of ſin.</hi> The former Heads regard only the <hi>ſubſtrate mater</hi> or <hi>entitative act</hi> of ſin, but this ſin in its <hi>formal nature.</hi> Our Adverſaries, the <hi>Pelagians, Jeſuites, Arminians</hi> and <hi>Semi-Arminians</hi> or <hi>New Methodiſts,</hi> al grant Gods permiſſion of Sin, but only ſuch as is <hi>otioſe, ſpeculative, negative</hi> and <hi>naked,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any efficacious active Influence for the production of its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titative act, or direction of it to its proper ends: But the ſacred

He anſwers, (1) <hi>That the ſons of Eli were, for their flagitioſe impieties, deſtined and devoted by God to ruine.</hi> (2) <hi>That the puniſhment of death here mentioned, ſeems properly and directly to be underſtood of temporal, not eternal.</hi> (3) <hi>That however it be, as it is manifeſt, that ſin precedes damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the inflicting of puniſhment, ſo it's neceſſary that the preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of every ſin be preſuppoſed in the eternal purpoſe of God, of damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inflicting puniſhment, whether temporal or eternal.</hi> (4) <hi>That the particle</hi> Quia <hi>Becauſe, here uſed, doth not alwayes denote a proper cauſe, but a reaſon of conſequence, which may be taken from the effect, and other arguments beſides the cauſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>Strangius</hi> here raiſeth a great deal of duſt, to blind our eyes from beholding the Meridian light of this Text; but to anſwer briefly: (1) We ſay, that his firſt anſwer ſmells too rankly of Pelagianiſme, in that it makes the ſins of men the cauſe of the Divine Wil: The Sons of <hi>Eli were not for their flagitioſe Impieties deſtined by God to ruine,</hi> as if their flagitioſe Impieties were cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of and influential on Divine deſtination; but the Soverain God deſtined, by an abſolute decree, to leave them to thoſe fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitioſe ſins, and for them to deſtroy them. What are the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequents of ſuch a conditional Reprobation, we intend more fully to ſhew hereafter, <hi>c.</hi> 5. §. 3. (2) That the Death here intended and inflicted was only <hi>temporal,</hi> is too crude a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a Divine inſtructed in the knowledge of divine wrath: Yea, <hi>Strangius</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>that they merited eternal wrath;</hi> and how then could they be exemted from it, who had rejected the Merits of their <hi>Meſſias?</hi> (3) What he addes, touching the preſcience of every ſin to be preſuppoſed in Gods eternal purpoſe of damning men, has a tincture alſo of rank Pelagianiſme: for if the preſcience or previſion of actual ſins, yea of final Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, be that which moves the divine Wil to decree the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of men, then it wil, by a paritie of reaſon, neceſſarily follow, that the preſcience or previſion of mens Faith and final Perſeverance is that which moves the divine Wil to elect men: for if Reprobation be conditional, Election muſt be ſo alſo, as our Divines on Scripture-reaſon ſtrongly demonſtrate. <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> in his <hi>Animadverſ.</hi> againſt <hi>Hoard,</hi> invictly proves, <hi>p.</hi> 226. and elſewhere, <hi>That Decrees purely conditional are very much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming the Divine Wil.</hi> But of this more in what follows, <hi>c.</hi> 5. §. 3. (4) As for the Particle <hi>Quia, Becauſe,</hi> [1] We grant, <hi>that it doth not alwayes denote a proper Cauſe, but a reaſon of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and that taken ſometimes from the effect.</hi> But, [2] that it cannot denote a reaſon of Conſequence taken from the Effect in this Text, is moſt evident; becauſe Gods Wil to ſlay them was not the effect of their diſobedience, but their diſobedience was the conſequent of Gods wil to ſlay them. [3] Take notice, that we do not ſay, that Gods wil was the cauſe of their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or ruine, but only that the later was the conſequent of the former: God in his moſt ſoverain wiſe and efficacious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe decreed to leave the ſons of <hi>Eli</hi> to ſuch flagitioſe ſins, as ſhould prove the cauſe of their ruine, both temporal and eternal:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57509:49"/>

                     <p>Now let us ſee what anſwer <hi>Strangius, l. 4. c. 9. p.</hi> 836. gives hereto: <q>It muſt be obſerved, ſaith he, that <hi>Job</hi> in this Chapter doth in an illuſtrious manner diſcourſe of Gods Providence ſo ordering things, that nothing comes to paſs caſually or fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly, nothing without his deſtinated counſel, <hi>that nothing is done but what he wils, either by permitting that it be done, or by doing of it,</hi> as <hi>Auguſt. Enchirid. c.</hi> 95. ſo that God doth effect and procure whatever things are good, and alſo wiſely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing the future event, doth permit ſins, which he directs to good ends ordained by him.—Deſervedly therefore <hi>Job</hi> among other things obſerves, that it is from Divine Providence,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57509:49"/>
that ſome erre, and draw others into error; and that both as to maters of Religion, and in other maters of this life; not that is he the Author of ſeduction and errors, but becauſe God, for the contemt and abuſe of his light, delivers them deſtitute there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of into a mind void of judgement, and preſenting objects and occaſions, opens a way, wherein they wander, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though this Paraphraſe be far ſhort of the mind of the Text, yet there is enough in it to confirme our Hypotheſis, and ſubvert his own Antitheſis. For (1) he grants, <hi>That nothing happens ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually, without Gods deſtinated counſel, according to that of</hi> Auguſtin, <hi>That nothing is done but what God wils,</hi> &amp;c. Now certainly Gods deſtinated counſel or determined wil is moſt efficacious and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible: ſo that if the permiſſion of ſin be from Gods deſtinated counſel, it muſt be alſo determined by his efficacious wil. (2) He grants, that God wiſely foreknows al future events, even the ſins of men: and how this can be without the efficacious predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his own wil to permit the ſame, neither <hi>Strangius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor any of his ſectators, could ever yet make out. (3) He grants alſo, <hi>That God directs thoſe aberrations and ſins to good ends appointed by him.</hi> And how can God direct the immanent aberra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mind, but by an efficacious predetermination of the ſubſtrate acts, and permiſſion of the vitioſitie? (4) He yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grants, <hi>That God delivers them unto a mind void of judgement:</hi> and what do we ſay more? Doth not this evidently denote an active efficacious permiſſion of ſin? But then (5) his laſt clauſe, <hi>preſenting objects and occaſions,</hi> &amp;c. overthrows al his former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions: for the wiſe God doth not only preſent objects and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and thereby open a way to mens infatuation, but he alſo predetermines the mind to the entitative act, and efficaciouſly permits the vitioſitie, without the leaſt finger in the ſin.</p>
                     <p>There are other Scriptures which demonſtratively prove Gods efficacious permiſſion of ſin; as <hi>Eſa. 63. 17. O Lord, why haſt thou</hi>

                        <hi>made us erre from thy ways, and hardened our hearts from thy fear? Strangius, pag.</hi> 839. grants, that the Verbe in both Members be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Hiphil</hi> oft notes a <hi>double action,</hi> as when we ſay, <hi>That one makes another to do a thing;</hi> though he pretends, <hi>that ſometimes it only notes a permiſſion of the action.</hi> But it is certain, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not here denote a mere naked permiſſion, but ſuch as procedes from the efficacious wil of God. The like <hi>Jer. 20. 7. O Lord, thou haſt deceived me and I was deceived.</hi> Whereto anſwers, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14. 9.

of a <hi>Grotian</hi> and <hi>Caſſandrian</hi> ſpirit, which I preſume, he has no kindneſſe for, whereby al thoſe prophetic predictions about An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt are fixed on <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or ſome other falſe Teacher in the Primitive Churches: whereas it is moſt evident, that this <hi>ſending them ſtrong deluſion</hi> is aſcribed immediately to God, as a righteous Judge. (2) Neither is this only a mere <hi>permitted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent,</hi> as he phraſeth it; but the terme <hi>ſending</hi> importes <hi>active efficacious influence</hi> on Gods part that ſends, not on the ſin formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, but on the ſubſtrate mater, or act entitatively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. But <hi>Strangius, lib. 4. cap. 10. pag.</hi> 853. is here alſo more candid, granting, <hi>Gods ſending the efficace of error,</hi> to be the ſame with Gods <hi>pouring out a ſpirit of ſlumber, Eſa.</hi> 19. 14. and <hi>Jerome</hi> thinkes, that <hi>Paul</hi> took his words from <hi>Eſa.</hi> And <hi>pag. 855.

                     <p>But let us a little more fully examine the general ſolutions<note place="margin">The falſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries refuted.</note> which our Adverſaries give to theſe Texts touching Gods <hi>active excecation and induration.</hi> 1. A Divine among our ſelves, whom I love and honor, thinkes, that thoſe Texts in the O. T. which ſpeak of Gods <hi>hardening men,</hi> &amp;c. might, according to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Idiome, have a <hi>ſofter ſenſe;</hi> ſo (as I ſuppoſe he muſt mean) as a mere permiſſion is intended thereby. But to anſwer hereto in the words of <hi>Strangius, lib. 4. cap. 9. pag.</hi> 839. The Hebraic forme is oft in <hi>Hiphil,</hi> which denotes a double action, <hi>to make a man to do a thing;</hi> yea ſometimes this induration is expreſſed by Verbes in <hi>Piel,</hi> of an active import, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 21. &amp; 9. 12. &amp; 10. 20, 27. &amp; 11. 10. &amp; 14. 4, 8. <hi>Deut. 2. 30. Joſh.</hi> 11. 20. Whence <hi>Strangius</hi> concludes, <hi>That this phraſe of Scripture oft occurring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes much more than a mere naked permiſſion.</hi> Though what this ſhould be he is at a great loſſe.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Baronius, Metaphyſ. Sect. 8. Diſp. 3. §. 99. pag.</hi> 159, 160. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <q>That there are four actions of God in induration; (1) He puniſheth former ſins by permitting men to fal into greater. (2) He offers to them an occaſion of repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (3) He gives them not grace to improve the occaſion; whence they are ſaid to be blinded and hardened. (4) He offers to them occaſions of greater ſins, by ſuch things as objectively move them to ſin.</q>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:57509:52"/>
But al this, which <hi>Baronius</hi> allows God in judicial execation and Induration, comes far ſhort of what the forecited Scriptures mention. For beſides the mere permiſſion of Sin, privation of Grace, and offering occaſions and objects, the Scripture menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a <hi>Tradition and delivering up to the very act of ſin,</hi> yea, <hi>Gods immediate efficacious hand in the very act of ſin, conſidered entitatively and materially.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. But we come to <hi>Strangius,</hi> who, in his conceſſions goes beyond the former Divines, yet comes ſhort of the genuine mind and ſpirit of thoſe Texts, which ſpeak of Gods judicial Exceca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Induration. (1) He grants, (contrary to the ſentiment of a reverend Divine among us) <hi>that active excecation is aſcribed unto God.</hi> So <hi>l. 4. c. 8. p. 819. Active excecation,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to God, Satan, and the Sinner himſelf. Satan and the Sinner in that action do greatly ſin, but God actes moſt juſtly. God can as juſtly puniſh Sinners with excecation of mind, as he puniſhed</hi> Elymas <hi>the ſorcerer with corporal excecation,</hi> Act. 13. 11. (2) Thence <hi>p.</hi> 822. he addes: <hi>Herein the whole difficultie lies, that in this action we rightly diſtinguiſh that which is ſin, and the cauſe of ſin, whereof God is not the cauſe, from the puniſhment, which God in juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicts.</hi> So <hi>p. 829. In al vitioſe action, the action ſubſtrate to the vice, or whatever there is of entitie and poſitive therein, muſt be reduced to God as the firſt cauſe, who doth concur therewith, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſeparate from the vice or defect annexed thereto; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever entitative or poſitive is found in any obduration, in like manner it muſt be referred to God, albeit he hath no commerce with the vice of the action.</hi> This ingenuous conceſſion of <hi>Strangius,</hi> did he not overthrow it by other poſitions, were ſufficient to period our controverſie: for what do, or need we deſire more than what he here grants? If whatever be <hi>entitative</hi> or <hi>poſitive</hi> in obduration be from God, then ſurely the ſubſtrate mater or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titative act of that whereto ſin is annexed, is from God. But here lies the point of our Controverſie with <hi>Strangius,</hi> he holds that there be ſome acts ſo intrinſecally evil, as that you cannot ſeparate the entitative act from the ſinful reference it has to its object. But, (3) <hi>Strangius</hi> addes, <hi>p. 831. That in the ſame Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the ſin and puniſhment are conjunct,</hi> &amp;c. This indeed is a great conceſſion, that which overthrows <hi>Strangius</hi>'s Antitheſis; for, if in the ſame Act the ſin and puniſhment be conjunct, then how can God concur to the act as a puniſhment, and not concur
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57509:53"/>
to the ſubſtrate mater or entitative act which has ſin annexed to it? This Knot the acuteſt of <hi>Strangius</hi>'s Sectators wil never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Again, (4) He addes, <hi>p. 831. That the very Permiſſion of God is the act and effect of the wil of God.—For to wil to permit, and adviſedly to permit is alſo to act. What is done by God negatively in regard of his tranſient act, is done alſo poſitively, in regard of his interne immanent act.</hi> Herein alſo he lays before us a pregnant Truth, which is directly contradictory to his own Hypotheſis: for, [1] If Gods permiſſive Wil as to ſin be not only <hi>negative</hi> but alſo <hi>poſitive,</hi> then it muſt be efficacious. Again, [2] If Gods permiſſion of ſin be poſitive and efficacious, then alſo his Decree of Reprobation to permit ſin muſt be poſitive and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, which directly impugneth <hi>Strangius</hi>'s Opinion. (5) He addes, <hi>p. 832. That other actions alſo concur with Gods Permiſſion, becauſe he alſo rules, moderates and ordains what he permits, and concurs to the actions ſubſtrate to the ſin it ſelf.</hi> Is it ſo indeed? What then do we contend ſo vehemently for? what made <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> write ſuch a voluminous diſcourſe, and oppoſe <hi>Rutherford, Twiſſe,</hi> and other <hi>Calviniſts</hi> with ſo much violence, when as here he grants whatever they contend for? But to ſpeak the truth, there yet lies a Snake under the herbe; albeit <hi>Strangius</hi> ſeems to grant ſo liberally Gods efficacious concurſe to the <hi>ſubſtrate act of ſin,</hi> yet indeed, when he comes elſe-where to ſtate this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe, he makes it be only a remote concurſe to the act conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in genere,</hi> in <hi>its generic nature,</hi> not to the individual particular act as ſo or ſo circumſtantiated. And herein he is followed by<note place="margin">Gods Concurſe to the individual act which is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note> a Divine of Name among us: wherein lies the ſpirit of al their ſolutions and oppoſitions. But how inept and evanid this ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge is, wil be very evident, if we conſider the nature of al phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic or natural acts. Is not every natural or entitative act indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual or ſingular? Are not al natural Acts the effluxes of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Suppoſites</hi> or perſons? and if the ſubject be ſingular, muſt not the Action be alſo ſingular? To talk of a natural action <hi>in genere,</hi> or <hi>ſpecie,</hi> what a wild conceit is this, that which al true Logic and Philoſophie both new and old contradicts? It's true, human acts, as to their <hi>moral</hi> conſideration, may be diſtinguiſhed into <hi>generic, ſpecific,</hi> or <hi>individual:</hi> but if we conſider human acts in their <hi>natural entitative</hi> Being, ſo there neither is nor can be any ſuch thing as <hi>actio in genere, action in general;</hi> but al are <hi>ſingular</hi> and <hi>individual.</hi> So that if God concur to the act of ſin, it muſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57509:53"/>
be to the act in its individual ſingular nature, not <hi>morally</hi> but <hi>phyſically</hi> and <hi>entitatively</hi> conſidered; of which more hereafter, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. §. 1.</p>
                     <p>But to give a diſtinct and Theologic Idea of Gods Judicial<note place="margin">How God ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being the cauſe of ſin.</note> Excecation and Induration, with the Vindication of his Sacred Majeſtie from being the Author of Sin, the following Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Determinations may be of uſe to us. (1) We are to diſtinguiſh Gods concurſe in <hi>Judicial Induration</hi> or Hardneſſe, from that of the Sinner. (2) Gods Concurſe in Judicial Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may be conſidered either in regard of his <hi>Decree,</hi> or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>actual execution.</hi> (3) Induration may be diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Natural:</hi> or into <hi>ſinful</hi> and <hi>penal.</hi> Theſe things being premiſſed, the true nature of Gods judicial excecation and Induration wil appear in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Propoſitions.</p>
                     <p>1. Prop. <hi>Gods Decree is not properly the cauſe of mans Hardneſſe of heart or Damnation, but only of the Negation or withdrawment of preventing Grace, which God is no way bound to give.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Reprobation is not the proper <hi>efficient</hi> or <hi>formal</hi> cauſe of the Sinners Induration or Condemnation, but his own wilful obſtinacie. This ſufficiently clears the Sanctitie and Juſtice of God.</p>
                     <p>2. Prop. <hi>Yet ſuppoſing the Decree of Reprobation, the ſinners In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration or Hardneſſe follows infallibly, and in ſome ſenſe neceſſarily; i. e.</hi> by a modal hypothetic neceſſitie, not brutiſh or coactive, ſuch as ſhould deſtroy Libertie. The holy God doth not infuſe hardneſſe, or by any compulſion hurrie men into it, but leaves them to the ſwinge of their own luſts, which violently hurrie them into ſuch courſes as neceſſarily harden. This alſo cleareth Gods Juſtice from the imputation of ſin.</p>
                     <p>3. Prop. <hi>Gods Providence in Judicial excecation and Induration is very efficacious and illuſtrious.</hi> (1) God leaves men to the Blandiſhments, Allurements, and Enſnarements of an heart-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching world, which inſenſibly harden. (2) He delivers up men to the power of Satan, the God of this world, whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and vaſſals they willingly become, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4. and ſo <hi>are taken alive captive at his wil,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 26.

(7) God doth poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea efficaciouſly concur to al that is poſitive, material, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, and natural in judicial hardneſſe, without the leaſt hand in the obliquitie or vitioſitie.</p>
                     <p>4. Prop. <hi>The ſuſpenſion of reſtraining Grace in Judicial excecation is not properly a privation of any Grace due to the Creature, but a negation or withdrawment of undeſerved and abuſed Grace.</hi> For the clearing whereof we are to conſider, the difference between Man and God in this particular: No meer man may or ought to permit or deliver up another to ſin or hardneſſe, if it be in his power to hinder: (1) Becauſe al men are under a Law and obligation of ſubjection to their Creator, whereby they are obliged to promove his Glorie, and prevent ſin and rebellion againſt him the moſt they can. (2) Becauſe al men are under a communion of Natures, and therefore bound to afford aſſiſtance each to other, ſo far as they may for their natural and moral
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57509:54"/>
good. But now the ſoverain Creator of man is under no ſuch obligation, and therefore may as he pleaſe diſpoſe of his own grace, or ſuſpend it, ſpecially when abuſed by ſinners.</p>
                     <p>5. Prop. <hi>God doth not deliver up men to judicial hardneſſe ſimply as hardneſſe, under that reduplication, but penally, as it conduceth to the vindication of his Juſtice.</hi> For the explication and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Propoſition we are to remember, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world of itſelf, purely, and ſimply evil: for if there were any pure and chiefeſt evil in the world, then God, who is the chiefeſt good, could not wil it: but the greateſt evil has ſomething of good mixed with it; and this God wils. Thus in judicial hardneſſe there is a penal vindictive good, which God wils for the illuſtration of his Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>6. Prop. <hi>In judicial hardneſſe, that which is morally evil in regard of man and his tranſgreſſion, is naturally good in regard of God and his Providence.</hi> For albeit God doth concur with the ſinner, who is deficient as to his dutie, yet God is no way deficient. (1) Al moral evil of ſin is only ſuch to him whoſe it is, or to whom it doth belong, as the Author thereof, by virtue of ſome Law he offends againſt: But now this judicial hardneſſe or ſin doth not belong to God as the proper Owner or Author of it, but only to the ſinner; neither doth the holy God offend againſt any Law. (2) The ſpecific qualitie of an effect is not to be aſcribed to the univerſal firſt cauſe, but to the ſecond particular cauſe, from which it receives ſpecification. (3) The ſinner is only the moral cauſe of his own hardneſſe; becauſe he is the meritorious cauſe thereof, and alſo a voluntary, yea wilful Agent therein. Al his hardneſſe is voluntarily contracted, albeit judicially inflicted by God: he ſuffers his heart voluntarily to be defloured by ſinful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: God threatens to ſuſpend his Divine influence, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate ſinner <hi>cries, Content:</hi> Satan comes and blinds his eyes, and he hugges him for it. So that the whole deficience or moral cauſalitie is on the ſinners part, not on Gods. The ſinner wants Divine influence and is willing, yea glad to want it: therefore his depraved wil is the ſole <hi>formal, vital, ſubjective</hi> and <hi>moral effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe</hi> of his own hardneſſe and ſin.</p>

(1) In anſwer to his firſt particular, we aſſert, that more may be gathered from this Text, than what he allows, namely, <hi>That God hath decreed, that, as a puniſhing Judge, he wil leave the rejecters of Chriſt to go on in their own ſinful way.</hi> For he himſelf grants, (which cannot be denied) <hi>That they were appointed to ſtumble on the rock of offence:</hi> And if ſo, then ſurely they were deſtined or appointed to the entitative act of ſin: for ſtumbling doth not only implie their <hi>deſtruction,</hi> as he inſinuates, but alſo
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57509:57"/>
their <hi>ſin.</hi> Whence, (2) there is ſomething more alſo implied, <hi>than that their oppoſition to him ſhal be their ruine.</hi> For it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely ſaid, <hi>That they were appointed,</hi> not only to their ruine, but alſo <hi>to their ſtumbling at the word, and being diſobedient,</hi> which notes the Decree of Reprobation to be abſolute and poſitive; yea predeterminative of the ſubſtrate mater of ſin. (3) Whereas he ſaith, <hi>That he ſpeakes not at al as willing their ſin, but only as one that penally denieth them further grace,</hi> this ſeems alſo againſt the expreſſe mind of the Text, which ſaith, <hi>They were appointed, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, i. e.</hi> according to <hi>Grotius, they were ordained, deſtined,</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to ſtumble at the word,</hi> &amp;c. This certainly denotes more than Gods penal denial of further grace. (4) Whereas he ſaith, <hi>That the thing that he is ſaid to ordain them unto, is not ſin, but ruine, the conſequent of their ſin, the word [ſtumbling and falling] ſignifying their deſtruction,</hi> it ſeems contradictory to the letter and mind of the words: for both <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſignifie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our precedent explication of them, primarily their ſin, and then their ruine or deſtruction, as the conſequent of their ſin. This alſo is evident from that parallel Text, <hi>Jude 4. For there are</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jude 4.</note> 
                        <hi>certain men crept in unawares, who were of old ordained to this condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ungodly men turning the grace of God into laſciviouſneſſe, and denying the only Lord God.</hi> Theſe ungodly men are ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>deſigned,</hi> and as it were before written in the book of Gods predetermination, to be given up to <hi>this condemnation, of turning the grace of God into laſciviouſneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. So that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that God foreordained and decreed, not only their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but to leave them to thoſe ſins, which ſhould cauſe the ſame.</p>
                     <p>But to ſum up the whole of this Head, we grant, (1) That ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Reprobation is not the cauſe either of mens ſins, or damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It's true, elective Grace is the cauſe of faith and ſalvation, but the Decree of Reprobation is not the cauſe of ſin or damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. (2) That Reprobation withdraws not any power from the perſon reprobated. Yet we denie, [1] That it is injuſt for God, by an abſolute, efficacious Decree, to reprobate ſome, for the glorifying of his own Juſtice: For albeit the Decree of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not an act of juſtice, yet it is not injuſt for God to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate any. [2] We denie alſo, that there is any motive, cauſe, or condition of Reprobation, as it regards the act of the Divine wil. Whence alſo [3] we denie, that the act of Reprobation is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57509:58"/>
merely negative; but affirme, that it is <hi>poſitive</hi> and <hi>abſolute;</hi> of which ſee <hi>Davenant Diſſert. de Elect. &amp; Reprobat.</hi> p. 113. Hence, [4] It neceſſarily follows, that when God predeſtines and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordains any unto Damnation, he predeſtines and preordains in like manner, by an efficacious act of his own ſoverain Wil, to leave men to their own ſinful courſes, and efficaciouſly to concur to the ſubſtrate mater of thoſe ſins.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57509:58"/>
in al Ages of the Church; and withal to ſhew who have in al Ages defended the Antitheſis of our Adverſaries. Firſt, among the Patrons of our Hypotheſis none deſerves a more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious name and mention than <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> that great Propugnator<note place="margin">Auguſtin.</note> or Champion of efficacious Concurſe. I am not ignorant that ſome of our Adverſaries, as <hi>Strangius</hi> by name, are ſo confident as to cite <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s teſtimonie in defenſe of their Antitheſis; but this is too palpable an abuſe to find place among the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or impartial Sectators of <hi>Auguſtin;</hi> whoſe ſentiments touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſubject are ſufficiently evident in his Works. Thus, <hi>de Grat. &amp; Lib. Arbitr.</hi> cap. 20. <hi>If the Scripture,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently inſpected, it wil appear, that not only the good wils of men, but alſo the bad, are ſo in Gods power, that he can incline them where and when he wil, to performe his benefices, or to inflict his puniſhments, by his moſt ſecret, yet moſt juſt judgement.</hi> Again, in the ſame book, he ſaith, <hi>That God workes in the hearts of men, to incline them which way he pleaſe, either to Good, out of his Mercie, or to evil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deſerts, by his Judgement, ſometimes open, ſometimes ſecret, but always juſt.</hi> So De Praedeſtinat. Sanct. c. 16. <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the power of wicked men to ſin; but that by ſinning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litioſely they do this or that, is not in their power, but of God dividing the darkneſs, and ordering it; that ſo hence what they do againſt the wil of God, might not be fulfilled but by the wil of God.</hi> Again, <hi>De Gen. ad literam lib. imperfecto,</hi> c. 5. <hi>Some things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>God makes and orders, other things he only orders; righteous men he makes and orders, but ſinners, as ſinners, he makes not, but only orders,</hi> i. e. In good actions he is both the cauſe of the good, and of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in ſinful acts he is not the cauſe of the ſin, but only of the act ordering it for his glorie. Again, <hi>De Civitate Dei,</hi> l. 13. c. 22. he ſaith, <hi>That Sin as it is juſtly permitted by God, fals under the Eternal Law,</hi> that is, the Divine Wil or Decree. Moreover, <hi>Auguſtin</hi> frequently aſſerts, <hi>that God puniſheth one ſin by giving men up to another:</hi> So <hi>Contra Julian.</hi> l. 5. c. 3. <hi>&amp; de Civitate Dei,</hi> l. 15. c. 6. <hi>&amp; libro de Natura &amp; Gratia,</hi> from <hi>cap.</hi> 20. to the end. To theſe Teſtimonies we may adde ſeveral Hypotheſes of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> which demonſtratively evince Gods Predeterminative Concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin. As, (1) He aſſerted, <hi>that Reprobation was the act of Gods abſolute Wil, and ſo in it ſelf poſitive and abſolute</hi> (2) He held, <hi>That Excecation and Obdura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the conſequent of Reprobation:</hi> of which ſee <hi>Janſenius, Auguſt.

Laſtly, that <hi>Auguſtin</hi> held Gods Efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous predeterminative Concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin, is evident from the falſe Imputations charged on him by the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, who imputed to him the ſame odioſe and forged conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, which have been ever ſince imputed to the Aſſertors of <hi>Predeterminative Concurſe.</hi> As, [1] They falſely charged on him, <hi>that he aſſerted a fatal Neceſſitie, and ſaid, that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled mon to ſin.</hi> Whereas <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> l. 1. q. 2. <hi>ad Simpl.</hi> anſwers (in the ſame manner as we now adays) <hi>That God is ſaid to harden ſome Sinners, in that he has not mercie on them, not that he impels them to ſin,</hi> &amp;c.

To conclude, there is ſcarce any imputation falſely charged on thoſe that aſſert predeterminative Concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin now a-days, but it was alſo imputed to <hi>Auguſtin</hi> by the Pelagians of old, and wiped off by him, as by us, which ſufficiently demonſtrates, that his Sentiments were as to this Hypotheſis the ſame with ours. He that wil ſee more of <hi>Auguſtins</hi> mind about this mater, may conſult <hi>Rutherford, de Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntia,</hi> cap. 30. <hi>Chamier, Panſtrat.</hi> Tom. 2.

                     <p>Next to <hi>Auguſtin</hi> follow his Sectators and Diſciples, <hi>Proſper</hi> and<note place="margin">Proſper <hi>and</hi> Fulgentius.</note> 
                        <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> whom our Adverſaries would fain make to be of their perſuaſion, but without ſhadow of Truth or Reaſon. As for the ſentiments of <hi>Proſper</hi> touching our Hypotheſis, they are to be ſeen, <hi>ad capitula Gallorum,</hi> where, following <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> he makes <hi>God to wil ſin as the puniſhment of ſin.</hi> So <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> l. 1. <hi>ad Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> c. 26. <hi>God, albeit he be not the Author of evil cogitations, yet he is the Ordinator of evil Wils: neither doth he ceaſe to work good out of the evil work of every evil man: neither in the very injuſt works of the Wil, doth he relinquiſh the juſt order of his own works; becauſe this he hath in that very order, that he doth juſtly deſert the evil Wil—and in the very injuſt wil of the ſinner, he fulfills his own Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> &amp;c. What could be ſaid more evidently to demonſtrate our Hypotheſis? Is God <hi>the Ordinator of evil Wils?</hi> doth he not then
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57509:59"/>
efficaciouſly, yea predeterminatively move and order them in their very evil acts? And <hi>doth he not ceaſe to worke good out of their evil workes?</hi> Muſt he not then applie their wils to the entitative act of thoſe evil workes? And what is this but to predetermine their wils to the ſubſtrate mater of thoſe evil workes? Again, if God, <hi>in the very injuſt workes of the Wil doth not relinquiſh the juſt order of his workes,</hi> then ſurely he muſt of neceſſitie applie and predetermine the wil of the Sinner to the entitative act of the worke, thereby to maintain his own juſt order.</p>
                     <p>§. 2. We now paſſe on to ſuch as ſucceded the Fathers, and<note place="margin">Such as ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fathers.</note> albeit they lived in the boſome of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, yet they ſtil defended the Doctrine of <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and our Hypotheſis, as to <hi>Gods efficacious predeterminative Concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin.</hi> I ſhall begin with <hi>Anſelme,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> who flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed<note place="margin">Anſelme.</note> about the year 1095, an <hi>Italian</hi> by Nation, Monke by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, of a moſt acute Ingenie, devotional Sanctitie, conjoined with great Prudence and Humilitie, according to the character given him by <hi>Baronius.</hi> This <hi>Anſelme, de Concord. Praeſcientiae, Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinationis, Gratiae &amp; Liberi Arbitrii,</hi> c. 1. thus ſpeaketh: <hi>God worketh althings, which are wrought by a juſt or unjuſt Wil,</hi> i. e. <hi>both good and evil workes; In good workes truely he cauſeth both that they are, and that they are good; but in evil workes he cauſeth that they are, but not that they are evil.</hi> Herein he gives us the difference between Gods Concurſe to good and evil acts, as alſo the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of our Hypotheſis; for if God cauſeth evil acts that they are, then certainly he efficaciouſly moves and applies the wil to the act, which is al that we mean by Predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Next follows <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore,</hi> by Nation a <hi>Saxon,</hi> (and<note place="margin">Hugo de Sancto Victore.</note> ſo allied to us,) by profeſſion a Monk, contemporary with <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> who flouriſhed about the year 1130.

                        <hi>That God wils there ſhould be evil, and yet he doth not wil evil: He wils there ſhould be evil, becauſe it's good there ſhould be evil; but he wils not evil, becauſe evil it ſelf is not good.</hi> An excellent deſcription of Gods predeterminative wil and concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin, ſo as to vindicate his Sacred Majeſtie from any hand in the moral vitioſitie thereof: (1) <hi>God wils there ſhould be evil,</hi> i. e. he doth, by an omnipotent efficacious decree, wil the exiſtence of evil, in willing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate mater thereof: and yet (2) <hi>He doth not wil evil,</hi> i. e. he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57509:60"/>
doth not with a wil of approbation or any way morally wil evil as to its moral vitioſitie or formal reaſon. (3) <hi>It's good there ſhould be evil, i. e.</hi> as it conduceth to the illuſtration of Gods glorie; and ſo God wils it. But (4) <hi>evil itſelf,</hi> [morally conſidered as evil] <hi>is not good,</hi> and therefore not willed by God as ſuch.

                        <hi>over evil wils, doth, by an occult and inviſible operation, temper and incline them to his own wil.</hi> What could more expreſſely be ſaid for the aſſerting Gods efficacious predeterminative concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin? Doth God indeed preſide over the evil wils of men, and ſo, by an occult and inviſible operation, temper and incline them to his own wil? how is it poſſible then, but that he applie and determine them to the entitative act of their ſinful workes? And whereas <hi>Hugo</hi> foreſaw many would be then, as now alſo, ſcandaliſed at this doctrine, touching Gods ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin, he addes this as the reaſon of the offenſe: <hi>Not becauſe that which is ſpoken is not wel ſpoken, but becauſe that which is wel ſpoken is not wel underſtood.</hi> I wiſh our Adverſaries would wel conſider this prophetic reflexion of <hi>Hugo;</hi> of which more hereafter in <hi>Bradwardines</hi> ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>We paſſe on to <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> whom ſome of our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries<note place="margin">Aquinas.</note> would fain conjure into their Campe, and make a Patrone of their Antitheſis: but this is ſo great an impoſition on the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent world, that I cannot but admire at the confidence of thoſe who make uſe of it. Yet this has been the attempt not only of ſome leſſe converſant in <hi>Aquinas</hi>'s Workes, but even of learned <hi>Strangius,</hi> who is oft more candid and ingenuous than others of his perſuaſion. Thus <hi>Strangius, lib. 2. cap.</hi> 14. from <hi>pag.</hi> 313. to 317. endeavors to demonſtrate, <hi>That</hi> Thomas <hi>doth not admit that phyſic predetermination of God to al and ſingular actions of the wil:</hi> The like a reverend Divine of eſtime among our ſelves would fain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us, namely, <hi>That albeit the Dominicans are for ſuch an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal predetermination, yet</hi> Aquinas <hi>is not,</hi> &amp;c. But let us a little examine the reaſon of this ſubterfuge: (1) Was not <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> himſelf a Dominican, of the Order of <hi>Dominic?</hi> And are not al the Dominicans ſworne <hi>Thomiſts?</hi> Albeit they are in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their Order Dominicans, yet are they not al in regard of their Doctrine Thomiſts? How comes it to paſſe then that they ſhould contend ſo hotly for phyſic predetermination of the wil by God in al its natural actions, even ſuch as are ſinful, and yet <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:57509:60"/>
their Maſter againſt it? (2) Take the character of impartial Writers, and who ever denied this to be <hi>Aquinas</hi>'s ſentiment? See learned and acute Dr. <hi>Samuel Ward,</hi> Profeſſor of Theologie at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> his Determinations, <hi>pag.</hi> 117, 118. where he proves Gods predeterminative Concurſe to al actions of the wil out of <hi>Thomas.</hi> But becauſe Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> ſeems to be our friend, we ſhal appele unto our Adverſaries for the deciſion of this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, namely to <hi>Le Blanc</hi> and <hi>Baronius. Le Blanc, Concil. Arbitr. Hum. par. 3. theſ. 10. pag.</hi> 430. aſſures us, <hi>That</hi> Thomas <hi>and his ſectators the Dominicans, teach, for the explication of Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe—That God doth premove and applie the very ſecond cauſes to their worke: for this the dependence of the ſecond cauſes on God their first Mover doth require. For, according to their mind, God is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid to be the first Mover, becauſe he doth antecedently move and applie al other cauſes to their operations,</hi> &amp;c. What could be ſaid more evidently to explicate <hi>Aquinas</hi>'s mind herein? Thus alſo <hi>Baronius,</hi> who, in his <hi>Metaphyſics, Sect. 8. Diſp. 3. §. 78. pag.</hi> 146. imputes this celebrious Opinion <hi>of Gods previous predeterminative concurſe to al actions</hi> unto <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> as the principal Founder thereof. So §. 79. <hi>pag.</hi> 147. And §. 82. <hi>pag.</hi> 149. he urgeth, <hi>That from the opinion of</hi> Thomas <hi>it follows, that God is the Author of ſin.</hi> The like §. 85. <hi>pag.</hi> 151. But (3) to let paſſe the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of others, if we may be allowed the privilege of believing our own ſenſes, and the reflexions of our own reaſon thereon, it is to me moſt evident, that <hi>Aquinas</hi> has copioſely and nervoſely defended our Hypotheſis, and impugned the Antitheſis of our Adverſaries. Thus, 1. 2. <hi>Quaeſt. 79. Art. 2. The act of ſin is both</hi> Ens <hi>and Act, and in both regards it is from God: for it's neceſſary that every</hi> Ens <hi>or Being be derived from the first Being,</hi> &amp;c. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Strangius</hi> and a reverend Divine among our ſelves pretend, <hi>that this includes immediate concurſe, but not predeterminative,</hi> it is moſt evident, that <hi>Aquinas</hi> owned no concurſe but what was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinative: For what is <hi>predetermination of the wil, but the ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plication</hi>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57509:61"/>
he ſaith, <q>(3) That it is to be conſidered, that God doth not only move things to work, as by applying the formes and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of things to their operations, (as alſo the Artificer applies the axe to cut, who yet ſometimes gives not the forme to the axe) but alſo gives formes to creatures acting, and preſerves them in being—and becauſe the forme is in the thing,—and God is properly the cauſe of the univerſal Being in althings, which among althings is more intime, it follows, that God workes intimely in althings; and for this reaſon in ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, the operations of nature are aſcribed unto God, as work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in nature, according to that, <hi>Job 10. 11. With skin and with fleſh hast thou clothed me,</hi> &amp;c.</q> What could have been ſaid more evidently to demonſtrate our Hypotheſis? He ſaith, (1) <hi>That God actes in every Agent, not only finally and effectively, but alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally. (2) That God moves things to worke, by APPLYING (i. e.</hi> predetermining) <hi>the formes and virtues of things to their operations.</hi> Yea, (3) <hi>That God applies the ſecond cauſe to act, as the Artificer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the inſtrument to worke.</hi> Whereby he makes al ſecond cauſes, the wil not excepted, but a kind of inſtrument of Gods principal efficience: For the wil, albeit it may be termed a principal cauſe of moſt of its acts, yet in regard of the Divine concurſe, which it receives, and in virtue whereof it actes, it may ſafely be termed a vital Inſtrument. (4) <hi>That God acting most intimely in althings, the very operations of nature are aſcribed unto him,</hi> which notes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination in the higheſt point.

                     <p>We deſcend now to <hi>Scotus,</hi> (the Head of a Sect oppoſite to the<note place="margin">Scotus.</note> Thomiſts, yet) who hath given evident and ſtrong confirmation and demonſtration to our Hypotheſis. I am not ignorant, that a learned and pious Divine makes uſe alſo of <hi>Scotus</hi>'s name to patroniſe his Antitheſis: and I ſhal not denie, but that <hi>Scotus</hi> has in many points too much favored the Pelagian intereſt, which has inclined the Jeſuites to follow him rather than <hi>Thomas;</hi> yet this I no way dout but to make good, that as to our Hypotheſis, <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods predeterminative concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin, Scotus</hi> is fully of our perſuaſion. This wil appear evident, (1) if we

conſider his notion of <hi>Divine Preſcience</hi> of things future, which he makes to ariſe from the Divine Decree giving futurition to them, as <hi>Le Blanc, de Praeſcient. theſ. 33. pag.</hi> 443. confeſſeth.

(1) Negatively, <hi>That the wil cannot be determined,</hi> or <hi>predetermined, by any inferior cauſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then it were not ſuperior:</hi> for whatever cauſe predetermines another to act, is ſo far ſuperior to it: it being impoſſible, yea a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that the inferior ſhould predetermine the ſuperior. (2) Poſitively, <hi>That it is not against the nature of the wil to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined by a ſuperior cauſe, i. e.</hi> by God the firſt cauſe, who gave it being, and therefore may without violence to its libertie deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine or predetermine it in its operation: and <hi>Scotus</hi>'s reaſon is invincible; <hi>becauſe to be predetermined by a ſuperior cauſe, is very wel conſistent with the wils being a cauſe in its own order:</hi> Yea, we
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57509:62"/>
may raiſe this reaſon to a greater height, therefore the wil is a cauſe in its own order, <hi>i. e.</hi> a particular, proper, principal, or leſſe principal cauſe, according to the nature of its cauſalitie and effect, becauſe it is predetermined to act by God the ſuperior firſt Cauſe: ſo that Gods predeterminative concurſe to the actions of the wil, even ſuch as have ſin appendent to them, is, according to <hi>Scotus</hi>'s ſentiments, ſo far from infringing or diminiſhing the wils natural order and libertie in acting, as that it corroborates and confirmes the ſame. (4) Laſtly, <hi>Scotus in 2. Sent. Diſt. 37. q.</hi> 2. ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely, <q>That [albeit God determine the wil to the material act which is ſinful, yet] the vitioſitie of ſin is not to be attributed to God, but to the create wil, becauſe the create wil is under an eſſential obligation to give rectitude to the action; but God is not bound by any ſuch obligation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> Which is the ſame with the ſentiments of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and our reformed Divines, albeit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the new Methodiſts, as wel as Arminians and Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.</p>

To begin with <hi>Gregorius Ariminenſis,</hi> who was by profeſſion a Dominican, and great defendent of <hi>Augustin</hi>'s Doctrine; whom Biſhop <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> valued as the <hi>ſoundest</hi> of the Schole-men, and Dr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> as the <hi>acuteſt:</hi> His invict demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of our Hypotheſis we find, in <hi>Sent. 2. Diſtinct. 34. Art.</hi> 3. where he demonſtrates Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>immediate efficience in producing the entitative act of ſin thus:</hi> 
                        <q>(1) Every evil act when produced is conſerved by God. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The antecedent he proves thus: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe every evil act ſhould not in its exiſtence imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately depend on God, but be independent; and ſo by ſtronger reaſon, the wil itſelf, which is more perfect than its act, ſhould be independent. Again, if it be not repugnant to the Divine Bonitie to conſerve the evil act, neither is it repugnant to it to produce the ſame. (2) The wil is of itſelf indifferent to any act, therefore it muſt be determined to every act by God. (3) If God be not the immediate cauſe of the act, which is evil, he is not the Maker of al Beings. (4) Al good that is not God, is from God as the Efficient thereof; but the act morally evil is yet naturally good.</q> 
                        <hi>Ergo.</hi> Hence he procedes to anſwer the Objections of his and our Adverſaries thus: <q>(1) <hi>If God produce<note place="margin">Object 1.</note>
                              <pb n="117" facs="tcp:57509:62"/>
the ſame evil act, which man produceth, then he ſins as man ſins.</hi> Whereto he anſwers, by denying the conſequence, and that on this reaſon; becauſe man doth not therefore preciſely ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth an evil act, as it is <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>act;</hi> but therefore he ſins, becauſe he doth it <hi>evilly, i. e.</hi> againſt right reaſon; [or the Law of God] but now God produceth the ſame act according to right reaſon, and therefore wel. So the ſame man borne in fornication, is produced by God wel, but by the fornicator evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. </q>But (2) it is farther objected by his Adverſaries then, as by ours now, thus: <hi>Thou wilt ſay, that thoſe things that are,</hi> per<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> ſe, <hi>in themſelves [or intrinſecally] evil, as the hatred of God, or the like, can never be wel done: therefore neither by God.</hi> 
                        <q>I reſponde, ſaith he, (as we) that there is or can be no entitie which may not be wel done, albeit not by every Agent: <hi>e. g. man envieth;</hi> but God, although he produce the ſame act of envie with man, yet he doth not envie. For al ſuch acts, beyond the ſimple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction or motion of ſuch or ſuch a thing, do connote ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on the part of the Author, who is ſo denominated, which agrees not to God: So <hi>to ſteal,</hi> beſides the ſimple tranſlation of the thing from place to place, connotes the thing ſtolne not to belong to him that tranſlated it: but God tranſlating the ſame thing, doth not tranſlate what is not his own; and therefore is not ſaid to be the thief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> But here we are to note, that whereas <hi>Gregorius Ariminenſis</hi> makes God to be a <hi>partial cauſe</hi> of ſin, it is not to be underſtood, as if God were the <hi>partial</hi> cauſe of the entitative act, for ſo he makes God to be a <hi>total</hi> cauſe; but he cals God a <hi>partial</hi> cauſe of ſin, as he produceth only the entitative act, not the vitioſitie, whereof man only is the moral cauſe. Thus alſo <hi>Holcot,</hi> our Country-man, <hi>ſuper Sentent. lib. 2. Diſt. 1. q.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Holcot.</note> makes God to be a <hi>partial cauſe of ſin, yet not the Author of it:</hi> whereby he plainly means, as he explicates himſelf, that God is the phyſical cauſe of the ſubſtrate mater, or entitative act only, but man the moral cauſe of the vitioſitie alſo. This I mention, becauſe a reverend Divine of name among us from theſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Ariminenſis</hi> and <hi>Holcot,</hi> would perſuade us, that they make God the partial cauſe of the entitative act. We might adde to theſe the teſtimonies of <hi>Altiſſiodorenſis, in Sent.</hi> 2. where he proves<note place="margin">Altiſſiodorenſis</note> by ſtrong arguments, namely from the Paſſion of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c. That the evil action is from God operating and cooperating with the human wil;</hi> of which more in what follows touching <hi>Bradwardine.</hi>

                        <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> whom, might I be allowed my libertie, I ſhould rather reckon among our firſt Reformers, than among the Sons of Antichriſt; for indeed he was a zeloſe Patron of, and ſtout Champion for the fundamental points of the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſpecially efficacious free Grace, which he with ſo much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, ſtrength of argument, and flaming zele defended againſt the Pelagians of thoſe days. This <hi>Thomas Bradwardine,</hi> borne at <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> flouriſhed about the year 1350. He was a perſon of prodigioſe natural ingenie, which he greatly poliſht by al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of acquired Sciences, ſpecially the Mathematics and ſchola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic Theologie. He was a great Affecter and Admirer of meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſic Contemplations, which in his firſt ſtudies he greedily drank in, even to the neglect of the holy Scriptures, becauſe they favored not of a metaphyſic ſtyle, as he himſelf informes us, in his Book <hi>de Cauſa Dei.

(2) <hi>That althings which have any natural Entitie or Being, procede from Gods Providence actually and efficaciouſly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, and not merely permitting.</hi> Which he demonſtrates ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways: as [1] <hi>Becauſe there is no act ſimply evil and inordinate, by any inordination precedent to the divine wil.</hi> [2] <hi>Becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe would not be diſpoſed in the beſt manner.</hi> [3] <hi>Becauſe the Scriptures both of Old and New Teſtments, aſcribe to God in his Providence about Sin active Names.</hi> Thus <hi>cap.</hi> 32. p. 288.

                     <p>Hence, (4) He comes <hi>l.</hi> 34. to the ſtate of the controverſie,<note place="margin">How God wils Sin.</note> 
                        <hi>How God wils ſin, and how he wils it not.</hi> [1] He proves, <hi>p. 294, 295. That God muſt neceſſarily wil the exiſtence of Sin, becauſe he permits it: alſo God doth voluntarily provide for, yea act al the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary acts of the wil both good and evil, with al their poſitive cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which neceſſarily import ſin.</hi> Again, <q>This Propoſition, <hi>Sin is,</hi> is true; and therefore there muſt be ſome cauſe of its truth, which can be no other than the divine wil, from which al complexe beings as wel as incomplexe have their origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Again, `Whatever is good muſt procede from the firſt good: but that Sin exiſte, is good, according to <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> So <hi>Hugo</hi> ſaith, <hi>That God wils that ſins exiſte, becauſe this is good.</hi> Moreover, he brings in <hi>Hugo</hi> ſpeaking thus; (which deſerves a great remarque) <hi>If it be ſaid, God wils ſin, this ſeems harſh and ſcandalous to the ear; and therefore ſome pious mind doth refute this, not becauſe that which is ſpoken, is il ſpoken, but becauſe that which is wel ſpoken is il underſtood.</hi>
                        </q> [2] Thence <hi>Bradwardine</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes to refute <hi>Lombard,</hi> who aſſerts, <hi>That God wils ſin as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, not under this reaſon, as it is ſin; [i. e.</hi> materially or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titatively conſidered] which Hypotheſis of <hi>Lombard</hi> he refutes, by ſhewing, <q>
                           <hi>That the puniſhment of ſin is neceſſarily conjoined with the Sin:</hi> ſo that if God wils ſin as a puniſhment, he muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily wil the exiſtence of ſin. Alſo whoever knows two things to be neceſſarily and inſeparably conjoined, and wils that they ſhould be ſo conjoined, and knowingly and rationally wils
<pb facs="tcp:57509:64"/>
one; the ſame perſon wils alſo the other; ſpecially if about both he employ an act of his wil: But now God knows and wils that thoſe two, <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Puniſhment</hi> be conjoined together, and rationally wils the one, namely the puniſhment of ſin, therefore alſo the ſin. Again, he that wils an Antecedent, wils alſo the Conſequent, at leaſt in an univerſal, albeit not in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: for he that wils a whole, wils al the parts neceſſary thereto.</q> [3] Thence he procedes, <hi>p.</hi> 300. to ſhew, <hi>how God wils ſin: God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>doth no way wil Sin ſimply, but only in ſome limited reſpect:</hi> 
                        <q>For, to ſay that God wils ſomething ſimply, is, according to the commun manner of ſpeech, to ſay, that he loves it and approves of it as good. Yea, addes he, may it not be ſaid, that in the whole Univerſe there is no ſuch thing as Inordination, Deformitie, or Sin ſimply conſidered, but only Sin in ſome reſpect? Becauſe in regard of the prime and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Cauſe, al Beings both poſitive and privative are ſweetly diſpoſed with the higheſt wiſdome, beautie, and juſtice.</q> Whence [4] He gives us the difference between Gods Concurſe to ſinful acts, and to ſuch as are good, <hi>p. 302. God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is not the Author of ſin, as of that which is done wel:</hi> 
                        <q>For of this he is the Author ſo, as that he alone doth ſupernaturally create, and give to the wel-doer, Faith, Hope and Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> But it is not ſo as to ſin. <hi>i. e.</hi> As to good, God produceth not only the natural act, but alſo the moral Bonitie, but as to Sin, he produceth only the natural entitative Act. [5] He thence <hi>p.</hi> 302. expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, how the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and the Fathers denied, <hi>that God wils Sin:</hi> 
                        <q>When, ſaith he, <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and the other holy men denie <hi>that God wils Sin,</hi> the cauſe of this negation ſeems this: Becauſe the Apoſtle and <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and other holy men placed Predeſtination, Preſcience, and the like on Gods part, the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians</hi> and other Heretics would excuſe Sinners from their ſins, and retort the cauſe and blame on God, who ſo predeſtinated or foreknew: therefore theſe holy men would ſay, that God by his Predeſtination, Preſcience or ſuch like, doth not compel them againſt their wil to ſin, but that they ſin freely and by their own wil; and that God by predeſtinating, foreknowing, or willing ſins, doth not ſin, nor do unjuſtly, neither is he the firſt imputable, or culpable cauſe of ſins; but the firſt, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and culpable cauſe is the proper wil of the Sinner.</q> This indeed is the proper ſtate of our controverſie at this day.

Yea it ſeems more miraculoſe and great, to worke good out of evils than out of goods, or to worke good only. And without peradventure it ſeemeth ſo diſguſtful to many, if it be ſaid, that God wils and produceth the act of Inceſt of the Father with the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of the Son with the Mother, of Parricide, Sedition, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, and other like ſins: and yet not only the Saints, but alſo the Philoſophers ſpeak thus: For who in ſuch an inceſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the ſeed, and moves, creates, and infuſeth the ſoul into the <hi>foetus,</hi> but God? and however it may ſound, thus the Saints of God ſpeak, yea the Spirit of God, who ſpeaks in them.</q> What could be ſaid more acutely, demonſtratively and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely for the deciding our controverſie, would men but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it?</p>

                           <hi>That the evil action is from God operating and cooperating with the human wil. Altiſſiodorenſis</hi>'s ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are theſe, [1] From the <hi>Paſſion of Chriſt,</hi> which was good, and proceded from a good cauſe, namely the Wil of God. [2] From the act of Fornication, whereby an holy Prophet is begotten: which act is the cauſe of good, and therefore good; and yet it is alſo evil: and therefore an evil action as it is an action is good and from God.</q> Thence he addes the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of <hi>Thomas, in Quaeſt. de malo, q.</hi> 19. where he demands, <hi>Whether the act of ſin be from God?</hi> and he anſwers thus: <q>It muſt be ſaid, that among the Ancients there was a double opinion concerning this mater: ſome ſaid more anciently, <hi>that the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin was not from God;</hi> attending to the very Deformity of Sin, which is not from God: but ſome ſaid, <hi>that the action of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57509:65"/>
Sin is from God;</hi> attending to the very Eſſence of the Act, which muſt be granted to be from God, and that on a double reaſon; [1] <hi>Commun,</hi> becauſe God being <hi>Ens or Being by his own Eſſence,</hi> and his very Eſſence his Being, it muſt thence neceſſarily follow, that whatever doth <hi>participate</hi> of Being, muſt be derived from him who is <hi>Being</hi> by Eſſence. [2] <hi>Special:</hi> for it is neceſſary that al motions of ſecond Cauſes be produced by the firſt Mover, who is God, as <hi>p.</hi> 554.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>(6) <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> l. 2. c. 22. <hi>p.</hi> 559. riſeth higher, and proves ſtrongly, <hi>That it implies a contradiction for any Nature to act or move without God, of himſelf, properly, actually, and ſpecially applying it to act, and moving of it.</hi> Which he demonſtrates many wayes: as [1] Becauſe no natural virtue or forme can operate without Gods cooperating therewith. [2] Becauſe al natural things or cauſes are but as Inſtruments in regard of God the firſt Cauſe. [3] Becauſe the create wil cannot ſubſiſt of it ſelf; therefore neither can it act of it ſelf, as <hi>c. 24. p.</hi> 563. [4] Becauſe God, by reaſon of his infinite Actualitie, permits nothing but what he wils.</p>
                     <p>(8) <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> l. 3. c. 29. p. 739. aſcends yet higher, and<note place="margin">How God ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly impels men to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titative act of Sin.</note> demonſtrates, <hi>That God, albeit he impel no man violently againſt his wil, yet he impels al mens wils ſpontaneouſly, and draws them to al their free acts, even ſuch as have ſin annexed to them.</hi> 
                        <q>But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, addes he, it may be probably ſaid, that God doth in ſome ſenſe neceſſitate to the very act of ſin, as to the ſubſtance of the act; yet it doth not thence follow that he doth neceſſitate to ſin, or to the deformitie of ſin, as it is ſin, or the deformitie of ſin: for the omnipotent God may, as it appears, ſeparate the very ſubſtance of the act and whatever is poſitive in it from the Deformitie of ſin, and can produce and conſerve ſuch an effect really poſitive and good, without ſuch a defect and priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive malice: Specially, ſithat Sin, Deformitie, Vitioſitie, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is not eſſentially the very act, nor of the eſſence of the act, nor neceſſarily a conſequent of the ſubſtance of the act. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the good God acting rightly, pre-acting and in ſome ſenſe neceſſitating to ſuch an act, according to its ſubſtance and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture good, the vitioſitie or ſin doth not thence neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: whence therefore doth it follow, but from the free wil of the Creature freely deficient, and from the wil of the Sinner?</q> What could be ſaid more acutely, more judiciouſly, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57509:65"/>
and more piouſly, to put a period to this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, had not men a ſtrong impulſe to oppoſe the Truth? I have been the more prolixe in rehearſing theſe illuſtrious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative Sentiments of <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> becauſe I find nothing newly ſtarted by our Adverſaries, but what I find rationally, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly, and convictively ſolved by him, above three hundred years ſince. As for his ſolutions to the particular Objections made by his Opponents then, and ours now, we ſhal produce them in what follows in anſwer to the Objections againſt our Hypotheſis, <hi>Ch.</hi> 6. §. 1, 2.</p>
                     <p>Having produced the concurrent Sentiments of the ancient<note place="margin">The Dominicans ſentiments.</note> Fathers and Scholemen for the confirmation of our Hypotheſis, we might now deſcend to the later Scholemen, ſpecially the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts;</hi> but theſe lie under the ſame criminal accuſation and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with our Adverſaries, as the orthodoxe <hi>Calviniſt;</hi> and it deſerves a particular remarque, that look as the Pelagian Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites oppoſe the Dominicans in this point under the Bears skin of being <hi>Calviniſts;</hi> ſo the Arminians and New Methodiſts op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Calviniſts in the ſame point, under the Bears skin of being <hi>Dominicans:</hi> and indeed no wonder, ſithat the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Calviniſts in this point about Gods predeterminative Concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin do greatly accord. And let our Adverſaries ſay what they liſt againſt the Dominicans, it's certain, that in this mater they have done great ſervice to the cauſe and intereſt of Truth: and particularly <hi>Alvarez,</hi> who is<note place="margin">Alvarez.</note> principally ſtruck at by the adverſe partie, deſerves great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and diligent inſpection by thoſe who have any kindneſs for our Hypotheſis, or any part of the Doctrine of Efficacious Grace. I am not ignorant what an heavy load of Imputations, <hi>Strangius,</hi> and a Reverend Divine of Name among our ſelves, have laid upon him in their Oppoſitions to what he has writ in the defenſe of our Hypotheſis; but the Jeſuites themſelves, who are his moſt puiſſant Impugnators, give him a more candid and favorable treatment: For in the treaty between them and the Janſeniſts begun <hi>Feb.</hi> 18. 1663. the Jeſuites rejecting the Arbitrament of <hi>Gregorie Ariminenſis</hi> and <hi>Eſtius,</hi> whom they judged more ſevere, they pitcht upon <hi>Alvarez</hi> as the more moderate, to whom they required the Janſeniſts to conforme in thoſe points controverted, in order to an accommodement: and the reaſons they allege are of moment: <q>For, ſay they, <hi>Alvarez</hi> having aſſiſted at the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations

de Auxiliis,</hi> there is a grand apparence, that he and thoſe others who writ at the ſame time and ſince, took up this mode of ſpeech to ſalve Libertie, according to the movements and ſentiments which the Popes, <hi>Clement</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and <hi>Paul</hi> 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> had; albeit they made no Decree on this mater;</q> of which ſee <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futat. de Pere Ferrier,</hi> Chap. 6. and <hi>Idea of Janſeniſme,</hi> p. 82. wherein remarque, (1) That the Jeſuites, <hi>Alvarez</hi>'s ſworne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, give him a more favorable character, as one, who for his moderation was employed by the Popes to aſſiſt at the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations <hi>de Auxiliis,</hi> for the compoſing the differences in thoſe points in controverſie between the Dominicans and Jeſuites about Predetermination.

For mine own part, I cannot but confeſſe, that in thoſe Notions about Efficacious Grace and Predetermination, I read <hi>Alvarez</hi> with al poſſible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and exactitude of ſpirit, and found therein ſo penetrant an acumen, ſo profound ſoliditie, and ſuch maſculine Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, as that I never met with his equal, excepting <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardine</hi> and <hi>Ariminenſis.</hi> This Juſtice I conceive my ſelf under an eſſential obligation to do him, to wipe off thoſe undeſerved cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and aſperſions which <hi>Strangius</hi> and another Divine of note among us, have loaded him with.

                        <pb n="125" facs="tcp:57509:66"/>I now paſſe on to <hi>Janſenius</hi> and his Sectators, who are brought<note place="margin">The Doctrine of <hi>Janſenius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant with our Hypotheſis.</note> upon the Theatre by our Adverſaries as Patrons of their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis: but this is ſo great a miſtake in mater of fact, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but admire any learned man ſhould take refuge under it. Yet thus <hi>Strangius l. 2. c. 14. p.</hi> 318. brings in <hi>Janſenius</hi> oppoſing <hi>Auguſtin</hi> both to the Dominicans and Jeſuites as to the point of Predetermination. The like is urged by a Reverend Divine of<note place="margin">C. T. <hi>p. 3. p.</hi> 93.</note> repute among us. But this miſtake is too obvious and great to take place among diligent and impartial Inquirers: For (1) It's evident, that <hi>Janſenius</hi> rejected the terme Predetermination as maintained by the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> not the thing it ſelf as aſſerted by <hi>Auguſtin:</hi> Thus in his <hi>Auguſt. Tom. 3. l. 2. c. 22. pag. 77, &amp;c.</hi> he proves, <q>That there is no manner of ſpeech among the Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſo efficacious and pregnant to expreſſe Predetermination by, but <hi>Auguſtin</hi> uſeth the ſame to illuſtrate Gods efficacious concurſe. And <hi>Tom. 3. l. 8. c. 1. p.</hi> 343. he acknowledgeth, That thoſe learned men the Dominicans have reached the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of Divine Adjutorie, and thence the true opinion of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin.</hi>
                        </q> Again, <hi>cap. 3. p.</hi> 346. he ſaith expreſſely, <hi>that herein Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Adjutorie agrees with phyſic Predetermination, that the office of phyſically predetermining the wil doth truely belong unto it, and it may be termed by that name taken not only in the abſtract, but alſo in the concrete.</hi> Whence in the ſame Chapter he uſeth the very terme of <hi>phyſic Predetermination</hi> to expreſſe efficacious Concurſe by, albeit not in the ſame manner as it is uſed by the Scholemen. So that it's evident, he was not averſe from the thing, albeit he but ſeldome uſed the terme to avoid the cavils of Scholaſtic Theologues, as alſo to confine himſelf to the termes uſed by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin.</hi> (2) That reverend Divine among us, who makes uſe of <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s name againſt phyſic Predetermination, doth yet grant, that <hi>Janſenius</hi> held, <hi>the exiſtence of ſin to be neceſſary as a Puniſhment.</hi> Wherein he oppoſeth <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and alſo <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who held, <hi>that ſin as a puniſhment, was willed and cauſed by God,</hi> as before. (3) <hi>Janſenius Auguſt. de Statu Nat. Lapſ.</hi> l. 4. c. 21. <hi>p.</hi> 264. aſſures us, <hi>That men in their lapſed ſtate, before Faith be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, are under the captivitie of luſt, and can do nothing but ſin; which captivitie is the ſame with that foreſaid neceſſitie and coaction, whereby ſins committed by unbelievers are ſaid to be neceſſary, and therefore they have no power to abſtain from ſin.</hi> And <hi>Tom. 3. de Grat. Chriſti,</hi> l. 10. he ſtoutly maintains theſe following aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57509:67"/>
about Reprobation, which clearly evince Gods efficacious predeterminative concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin. [1] He proves, <hi>cap. 2. pag. 420. That Gods negative Reprobation is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive.</hi> [2] He demonſtrates, <hi>cap. 4. pag. 423. That the cauſe of Reprobation, according to its comparative conſideration, is the abſolute wil of God.</hi> This is owned by reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter, Cathol. Theol. part. 3. Sect. 7. §. 22. pag.</hi> 93. in theſe words: [<hi>Janſenius</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is that] <hi>the Reprobation of men was by Gods poſitive abſolute wil, of men in original ſin, and the effect of it excecation and obdura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This being his proper opinion, it neceſſarily follows, that he aſſerted Gods predeterminative concurſe to the entitative act of ſin: for, as it is granted by <hi>Strangius,</hi> and others, efficacious predetermination always follows as a neceſſary conſequent of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute predefinition: if God abſolutely decrees to leave men to ſin, it neceſſarily follows, that he efficaciouſly determine men to the entitative act of ſin. [3] He goes higher than moſt of our Divines dare do in this point, in aſſerting, <hi>cap. 5. pag. 424. That damnation, excecation, obduration are the effects of Reprobation.</hi> But yet <hi>cap. 7. pag.</hi> 427. he anſwers the objection of ſuch, that argue hence, <hi>That God lies in wait to deſtroy ſuch as are reprobated;</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us, <hi>that the ſinner only is the culpable criminal cauſe of his own damnation.</hi> And <hi>cap. 10. pag.</hi> 433. he demonſtrates, <hi>That Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates are not created unto damnation, i. e.</hi> damnation as ſuch is not the end of their creation: which ſufficiently vindicates the holy God from being the cauſe of their ſin or damnation.</p>
                     <p>As for the Janſeniſts, that they are of the ſame perſuaſion with<note place="margin">The Janſeniſts ſentiments.</note> the Dominicans as touching our Hypotheſis, is evident from their conceſſions to the Jeſuites in their Treatie begun <hi>Febr.</hi> 18. 1663. mentioned in the <hi>Refutation of Pere Ferrier, Chap.</hi> 6. alſo <hi>Idea of Janſeniſme, pag.</hi> 82. The ſum was this: The Biſhop of <hi>Comenge,</hi> a friend of the Janſeniſts, propoſed this as an expedient to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the two Parties, <hi>That the Janſeniſts declare, that they had no other ſentiment about this mater, but what was taught by the Thomiſts.</hi> And becauſe ſome of the Thomiſts flie higher than others, the Jeſuites demanded, <hi>That the Janſeniſts ſhould reduce themſelves to the forme of ſpeech uſed by</hi> Alvarez. So that it ſeems the Janſeniſts in the point of efficacious Concurſe are looked on by the Jeſuites (as indeed they are) as thoſe that went beyond the very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans. The Janſeniſts replied, <q>That the doctrine of <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> was not different from that of the Thomiſts, albeit it was
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57509:67"/>
not his deſigne to render himſelf conforme to them, but to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin.</hi>
                        </q> And the true reaſon why the Janſeniſts do not maintain greater correſpondence with the Dominicans, is, not their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in doctrine, but becauſe many of the Dominicans have by a <hi>Spirit of Cabal,</hi> or of Faction joined with the Jeſuites.</p>

Is it not ſtrange then, that Reformed Divines, yea ſuch as would be accounted Calviniſts, cannot allow the efficacious Concurſe of God ſo much as <hi>Trent</hi>-Papiſts allow?</p>
                     <p>§. 3.

But if any ſhal go about to ſet mans wil at libertie, and to tie up ſhort the decreeing and determining wil of God, as if this had not the determining ſtroke amongſt al poſſible evil actions or events, which ſhal infallibly be, and which ſhal infallibly not be, he may avoid the ſuſpicion of <hi>Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme</hi> and <hi>Manicheiſme,</hi> but he wil hardly avoid the ſuſpicion of <hi>Atheiſme.</hi> For the greater number of mens actions being wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and evil, if theſe come into act without Gods determinate counſel and decree, human affaires are more over-ruled by mans wil, than by Gods.</q> What could be ſaid more acutely and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly for the demonſtration of our Hypotheſis?

Contrary whereto he aſſertes, (1) <hi>That the concurſe of God with ſecond cauſes, even ſuch as are free, is an antecedaneous influxe upon the very ſecond cauſes themſelves, moving and applying them to their work.</hi> This he demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates both by Scripture and Reaſon. The Scriptures he cites are <hi>Eſa. 26. 12. 1 Cor. 12. 5, 6. Eph. 1. 11. Rom.</hi> 11. 36. His Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are cogent, namely <hi>from Gods prime cauſalitie, the inſtrumental concurſe of al ſecond cauſes, the dependence of the human wil,</hi> &amp;c. (2) He aſſertes, <hi>pag. 117. That this previous concurſe of God the firſt cauſe doth, according to its mode, modifie and determine al the actions
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57509:71"/>
of the ſecond cauſes.</hi> This, which is fully coincident with our Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, he invictly demonſtrates, <q>[1] becauſe the Divine wil determines itſelf for the production of every the moſt ſpecial and ſingular effect; therefore it is not determinable by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior cauſe, as the influence of the Sun is. [2] Becauſe as mans free wil determines althings ſubject to it, ſo much more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly doth the Divine wil determine al create things ſubject to it. [3] He demonſtrates the ſame from the ſupreme Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Divine Providence, whereunto it belongs determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to wil and predefine al and ſingular things which are done in time, and to deſtine the ſame to thoſe ends intended by itſelf, as alſo to move and applie al ſecond cauſes to their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate effects. [4] Becauſe otherwiſe the concurſe and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of free-wil ſhould be exemted from the modification of Divine Providence; and ſo God ſhould not have a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over althings in particular, but only in commun: for, as <hi>Thomas, pag. 1. q.</hi> 22. teacheth, <hi>The Divine providence extendes only to thoſe things, unto which the Divine cauſalitie extendes:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if God doth not determine the concurſe of free-wil, he wil not have a providence, but only a preſcience thereof in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as <hi>pag.</hi> 118.</q> Thence (3) he aſſertes and demonſtrates, <hi>That this antecedaneous concurſe of God on ſecond cauſes modifying their actions, takes not away from them their proper mode of operating.</hi> This he addes to clear up the conciliation of efficacious predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive concurſe with human libertie, and he doth it with a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous dexteritie and ſagacitie, withal ſhewing, that the Moliniſts and Remonſtrants, with <hi>Cicero, make man ſacrilegious, whiles they endeavor to make him free.</hi> And <hi>Determinat. 26. pag.</hi> 132. touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolute Reprobation he ſaith, that it is the antecedent, but not the cauſe of mens ſin.

                     </p>
                     <p>§. 4. Having examined the Teſtimonies of ancient and later<note place="margin">Such as denie Gods Concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin.</note> Theologues that concur with us, let us now a little inquire into the origine of the Antitheſis, and who they are by whom it has been defended. The Antitheſis to our Theſis, namely, <hi>That God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs not to the ſubſtrate mater of Sin,</hi> is generally aſcribed to <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus,</hi> as the principal founder thereof, who denied Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate concurſe to actions, under this pretext, that hereby <hi>we make God the Author of mens Sins.</hi> But to ſpeak the truth, this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis is much more ancient than <hi>Durandus. Capreolus</hi> in 4. <hi>d. 12. q. 1. ad</hi> 1. aſſerts, <hi>That this was the Opinion of the Manichees:</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> in 2. <hi>d. 37. q. 2. a.</hi> 2. ſaith, <hi>That it it is next to the error of the Manichees, who held two Principes, one of Good, and the other of Evil.</hi>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:57509:72"/>
And the reaſon why this Antitheſis is fathered on the <hi>Manichees</hi> is this, becauſe whoever denies God to be the cauſe of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate mater or entitative act whereto ſin is annexed, muſt hold, <hi>That there is ſome real poſitive entitie in ſin whereof God is not the cauſe:</hi> whence by conſequence ſuch muſt aſſert, <hi>That there are two firſt Cauſes, one of Good, and the other of Evil;</hi> which was the error of <hi>Marcion</hi> and <hi>Manes,</hi> who held, there were two firſt Principes, the one <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the ſupreme good, who was the cauſe of al good;</hi> the other <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the ſupreme evil God, who was the cauſe of al evil.</hi> And certainly, they that maintain ſin to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its formal reaſon ſomething poſitive or real, or that God is not the cauſe of the ſubſtrate mater of ſin, wil neceſſarily fal into the ſentiments of <hi>Marcion</hi> and <hi>Manes.</hi> Again, <hi>Hierony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Epiſt. ad Cteſiphontem,</hi> makes this Antitheſis of <hi>Durandus</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dicebat [Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius] Deum, collato ſemel libero arbitrio, ulteriùs nobis ad operandum: non eſſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarium. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronym. ad Cte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiph.</hi>
                        </note> to be the Doctrine of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who, ſaith he, held, <hi>That God having once conferred free-wil, it is not neceſſary that he further ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with us:</hi> and he ſpeaks of natural operations, as of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was <hi>Durandus</hi>'s opinion. Though I cannot but confeſſe, <hi>Janſenius, Auguſt. Tom. 1. l. 5. c. 20. p.</hi> 119. tels us, the Pelagians granted, <hi>That God concurs to al the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Wil.</hi> But the Conciliation of theſe two oppoſite Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies is not difficult, in that the Pelagians granted Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe to al operations in termes, but denied it in effect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, as our Adverſaries now-a-days. <hi>Compton Carleton,</hi> in his <hi>Philoſoph. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſ. Diſput. 28. Sect.</hi> 1. §. 3. aſſures us, that the opinion of <hi>Durandus</hi> was aſſerted and defended before him, by <hi>Nicolaus Bonetus, lib. 7. Theol. c.</hi> 7. and it is not improbable but it was alſo by ſome others.</p>
                     <p>But yet it cannot be denied, but that the principal Author of<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Durandus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe.</note> this Antitheſis was <hi>Durandus;</hi> whence among the Scholaſtic Theologues it receives the Denomination of <hi>Durandiſme,</hi> which they cal a raſh, erroneous, dangerous error, little better than Arianiſme. <hi>Bellarm. l. 4. de Grat. &amp; lib.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57509:73"/>
Papiſts themſelves? But to give a convictive demonſtration, that thoſe who denie Gods Efficacious Concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin really fal under the Imputation of <hi>Durandiſme,</hi> we are firſt to examine what <hi>Durandus</hi>'s opinion as to Gods Concurſe is, and then who they are who may be reputed his Sectators.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Durandus</hi> propoſeth his opinion, <hi>in ſentent. l. 2. Diſt. 1. Q.</hi> 5. in theſe words, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trum Deus agat immediate in omni actione Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae, Whether God acts immediately in every action of the Creature?</hi> which he denies; and the principal reaſons of his negation are theſe: (1) <hi>Becauſe then God ſhould be the author of Sin.</hi> (2) <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch an immediate Concurſe deſtroyes human libertie,</hi> in that it determines the wil, and ſo puts an end to its Indifference: of which ſee <hi>Strangius, p.</hi> 142. So that indeed the very ſame arguments, which were uſed by <hi>Durandus</hi> againſt immediate Concurſe, are uſed by our Adverſaries the New Methodiſts againſt predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Concurſe as to the ſubſtrate mater of Sin. And albeit the moſt of them profeſſe a great diſpleaſure againſt the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis of <hi>Durandus,</hi> yet, I muſt freely declare my mind, I cannot conceive how they can, without apparent contradiction, defend their own, but by eſpouſing that of <hi>Durandus,</hi> which a reverend Divine of great name among us profeſſedly doth; And that the moſt of our Adverſaries, even among the New Methodiſts, who in profeſſion diſown it, fal under the imputation of <hi>Durandiſme,</hi> we ſhal anon make evident, when we come to treat of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſentiments: at preſent take theſe <hi>Criteria</hi> or diſtinctive notes of <hi>Durandiſme.</hi> (1) Al ſuch as aſſert a <hi>Divine Concurſe to the principe or ſubject only, and not immediate unto the Act,</hi> fal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the imputation of Durandiſme. This is wel obſerved by <hi>Strangius, l. 1. c. 10. p.</hi> 57. where he tels us, <hi>That thoſe who allow only a Concurſe to the ſecond Cauſe, moving it to act, without a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued concurſe to the action, fal into the error of Durandus.</hi> Herein <hi>Durandus</hi> is followed by <hi>Aureolus,</hi> a profeſſed abettor of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randiſme.</hi> Thus alſo <hi>Amyraldus,</hi> and a Divine of name among our ſelves. (2) Al thoſe who hold only <hi>a general immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe to the act, ſuch as is determinable by the mater it workes on, as the Influence of the Sun is by its mater,</hi> are deſervedly branded with the black note of <hi>Durandiſme.</hi> Thus <hi>Baronius,</hi> together with the Remonſtrants and Moliniſts. (3) Al ſuch as denie <hi>every real Being or Entitie to be from God by an immediate efficience,</hi> juſtly fal under the marque of Durandiſme. Thus <hi>Camero,</hi> and our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57509:73"/>
generally, who denie that God doth efficaciouſly concur to the ſubſtrate mater of Acts intrinſecally evil. (4) Al thoſe who affirme, <hi>That it implies no contradiction for God to make a creature which ſhal act without immediate concurſe,</hi> muſt neceſſarily ſymboliſe with <hi>Durandus.</hi> This is acknowledged by <hi>Baronius, Metaph. Sect. 8. Diſp.</hi> 3. S. 61. p. 131. where he brings in this as the Second argument for <hi>Durandus, That God can give to the creature a power to act without his concurſe, ſithat this involves no contradiction.</hi> To which he anſwers wel, in the Negative, that for God to make ſuch creatures as ſhould not depend on him in operation as wel as in eſſence, involves a flat contradiction, becauſe dependence in Eſſence and Operation is eſſential to the creature. This piece of Durandiſme <hi>Strangius</hi> and others ſeem chargeable with, as hereafter, in our account of <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But we deſcend to the particular Sects, who oppoſe our The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,<note place="margin">The Jeſuites and Moliniſts.</note> with endeavors to evince how far they fal in with the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis of <hi>Durandus.</hi> And we ſhal begin with the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who now generally paſſe under the name of <hi>Moliniſts,</hi> from <hi>Ludov. Molina</hi> their chief Captain, who in his <hi>Concordia Lib. Arbitr. cum Gratiae donis,</hi> &amp;c. Quaeſt. 14. Diſp. 26. aſſertes, (1) <hi>That Gods immediate concurſe terminates not on the human wil by applying it to act, but only on the act it ſelf and effect.</hi> Whence, (2) <hi>That this Concurſe is not antecedent or previous as to the act, but only ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multaneous;</hi> i. e. <hi>That God immediately concurs together with the wil to the ſame act, and conſerves the ſame.</hi> Thence, (3) <hi>That this immediate concurſe of God is not predeterminative, at leaſt as to human acts, but only indifferent and determinable, like that of the Sun.</hi> Whence, (4) <hi>That as to the ſubſtrate mater of Sin, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Concurſe doth no way determine the wil, or applie it to its act, but only influence the act in a general indifferent manner, ſo as the wil ſtil retains its innate indifference, and libertie of acting or not acting.</hi> Such are the Sentiments of the Moliniſts or Jeſuites, wherein they are greatly oppoſed both by Dominicans and Janſeniſts: Thus <hi>Janſenius, Auguſt. Tom. 2. lib. 6. ſingul. c. 14. p.</hi> 58. where he proves, <hi>That this ſimultaneous Concurſe confers no forces or aide to ſecond Agents, but only accommodates it ſelf to the forces of the create pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> &amp;c. which ſufficiently demonſtrates the identitie of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Durandiſme, albeit the avouchers of it oppoſe <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> with great vehemence.</p>

His book he termes, <hi>A Quadripartite Diſputation, touching the mode how the Concurſe of God and the Creature ſtand in conjunction for the production of free Acts, of a natural order, ſpecially ſuch as are wicked:</hi> He bends his Diſputation both againſt the <hi>Predeterminants,</hi> as alſo againſt the Aſſertors of <hi>Middle Science.</hi> His firſt part is general, ſtating the controverſie between the Jeſuites, who aſſert a <hi>Middle Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and the Dominicans, the Aſſertors of <hi>Predetermination;</hi> and withal explicating the origine of the Controverſie from the <hi>preſuppoſed Immediation and real Identitie of the Divine and creatural Concurſe.</hi> His Second Part is againſt the Jeſuites, to demonſtrate, <hi>That a next, immediate and identific concurſe of God to al acts both good and bad cannot be defended by the artifice of their Middle Science.</hi> In his third part he diſputes againſt the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> proving, <hi>That God doth not concur with us to acts of a natural order, ſpecially ſuch as are wicked, by a phyſic Predetermination, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over by an identific and ſimultaneous concurſe.</hi> In his fourth and laſt part he ſtabliſheth and demonſtrateth, (with al the force of Arguments ſuch a ruinous foundation wil admit) the Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of <hi>Durandus, That the general Concurſe of God to acts of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural order, ſpecially ſuch as are wicked, is not proxime, immediate and identific, but remote, mediate, and really diſtinct from the act of the creature.</hi> This Hypotheſis he defends as the only expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the conciliation of Divine Concurſe with human Libertie, the vindication of Gods Sacred Majeſtie from the imputation of being the Author of Sin, and the putting an end to thoſe endleſs controverſies about Divine Concurſe. And I cannot but conceive my ſelf under an eſſential obligation freely to deliver my mind in this point, that it is impoſſible for our Adverſaries, the New Methodiſts, or any others, to defend their Antitheſis againſt us from apparent contradictions and inconſiſtences with it ſelf, or to free themſelves from thoſe blaſphemous Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they charge upon us, unleſs they betake themſelves to this ſtratageme and ſubterfuge of <hi>Durandus</hi> and <hi>Lud. à Dola:</hi> and therefore I do no way wonder, that a Divine of great name and Head of that partie among us, doth openly declare his aſſent and conſent to this Hypotheſis of <hi>Durandus,</hi> it being the only refuge

(2) That it taketh away the power of the wil to oppoſite acts, <hi>pag.</hi> 148.

[2] Becauſe the action then as of ſuch a ſpecies muſt be from God. [3] Becauſe this opinion makes God to be injuſt and cruel, as <hi>pag.</hi> 151.

Thence he procedes <hi>pag.</hi> 153. to anſwer our principal argument, <hi>That the ſecond cauſe doth not act, but as moved by the first,</hi> and therein agrees with <hi>Suarez</hi> and other Jeſuites in aſſerting a previous indifferent concurſe. It's true, §. 58. <hi>p.</hi> 129.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57509:77"/>
he argues ſtrongly againſt <hi>Durandus,</hi> yet in fine <hi>pag.</hi> 153. fals in very far with him, but more fully with the Moliniſts and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants; which is wel obſerved by <hi>Le Blanc, Concil. Arbitr. Hum. theſ. 35. pag.</hi> 434. <q>This at leaſt, without al dout, is the opinion of <hi>Robert Baronius,</hi> in his Metaphyſic, where touching the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe of God,</hi> and ſo of its concord with human libertie, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to have altogether the ſame ſentiments with <hi>Fonſeca</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> namely that this concurſe is of itſelf indifferent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the ſecond cauſe to a certain ſpecies of action: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it needful, that God premove ſecond cauſes, but it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, that together with them he influence their actions and effects.</q> And indeed <hi>Baronius</hi>'s own illuſtration, <hi>Metaph. Sect. 8. Diſput. 3. pag.</hi> 143. ſufficiently clears this to be his proper opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; where he compares the Concurſe of God to that of the Sun, which is the ſame in the production of perfect animals and monſters, in itſelf indifferent, but modified and determined by the mater it workes upon: which is the very inſtance given both by Jeſuites and Arminians. Laſtly, <hi>pag.</hi> 159. he gives us four acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God in the <hi>induration</hi> of ſinners, which are no more than what Moliniſts and Remonſtrants acknowlege. Whence it is to me apparent, that it would not be an act of injuſtice, ſhould we reckon him among the Arminians, whoſe ſentiments and cauſe he has eſpouſed; yet by reaſon of his nominal repute among the Calviniſts, I rather incline to the more favorable cenſure of rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him among the new Methodiſts.</p>
                     <p>But yet our principal Antagoniſt is <hi>John Strangius,</hi> Profeſſor at<note place="margin">Strangius.</note> 
                        <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> who (as they ſay) having had his ſpirit chafed and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperated by the oppoſition of <hi>Rutherford,</hi> writ a great Volume in four Books, <hi>Of Gods Wil and Actions about ſin:</hi> wherein he bends his forces principally againſt the Dominicans, <hi>Twiſſe</hi> and <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> (who in his influences of the life of Grace, both Preface and Book, oft animadvertes thereon) as if theſe al, by aſſerting prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to the mater of ſinful acts, made God the Author of ſin. I muſt confeſſe, he diſcovers a natural acumen and a nervoſe vene of Reaſon in his Book, yet mixed with ſo great incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſelf-inconſiſtences, yea contradictions, that I cannot but marvel how ſuch a Maſter of Reaſon could ſatisfie himſelf with ſuch poor ſubterfuges and evaſions: But this I impute not to any defect in naturals, but in his cauſe, which admits not any ſolid reaſon for its defenſe. And that which yet ſeems more ſtrange
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57509:78"/>
to me is this, that he who oppoſeth with much vehemence <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Molina, Bellarmine,</hi> and the Remonſtrants in this point of Gods concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin, yet at long-run fals in with each of theſe parties in ſome one, if not al their ſentiments about this mater. (1) That he comes very near Durandiſme is evident, in that he holds the Concurſe of God not to be neceſſary to al acts of the creature, particularly to ſuch as are intrinſecally evil: For to ſuppoſe any real poſitive Being, that fals not under Gods efficacious concurſe, is to me no leſſe than Durandiſme. It's true, <hi>Strangius</hi> in words appears againſt <hi>Durandus,</hi> in owning an immediate Concurſe of God to al actions of the creatures, as <hi>lib. 2. cap. 5. pag.</hi> 163. But when he comes to explicate this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Concurſe as to actions intrinſecally evil, he placeth it only (as ſome now adays among us) <hi>in Gods conſerving the nature and innate diſpoſition of natural Agents, and giving them a ſelf-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining power, whereby they are rendred apt and habile for any congene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous action,</hi> as they now phraſe it. Thus <hi>pag. 164. Ergo ſi una Dei determinatio ſufficiat, quâ Deus Agentium naturalium naturam ac in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolem à ſe inſitam ac conſervatam determinavit, quid opus eſt multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus imò innumeris determinationibus ad eundem effectum,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>lib. 3. cap. 5. pag.</hi> 584. he layes down this as his Hypotheſis, <hi>That God doth not in althings determine the wil, but ſometimes permit it a free election, to chuſe this or that, to do this or that; and therefore in ſuch acts he has not decreed, that man ſhould preciſely chuſe this or that,</hi> &amp;c. And he proves it by this argument, <hi>That it is not impoſſible for God, who hath made man a free Agent, and conſerves his nature and forces, to permit ſomething to mans free-wil, it a ut per Deum non ſtet quin homo poſſit eligere alterutrum, agere aliquid, aut non agere,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein he proves, that it is not impoſſible for God to leave ſome things to mans indifference, without determining him to either extreme: and he proves this is not impoſſible, becauſe it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies not any contradiction; which is <hi>Durandus</hi>'s very argument againſt immediate Concurſe. (2) That <hi>Strangius</hi> conſpires with and eſpouſeth the ſentiments of the Moliniſts and Arminians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout indifferent ſimultaneous Concurſe is partly acknowleged by his friend <hi>Le Blanc, Concil. Arbitr. Hum. theſ. 36. pag.</hi> 434. having ſhewen the agreament of <hi>Baronius</hi> with the Moliniſts and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants, he addes: <q>Neither doth <hi>John Strangius</hi> ſeem to differ much from this opinion: for albeit he thinkes, <hi>lib. 1. cap. 11. That the action whereunto God and the creature concur, is in order of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57509:78"/>
nature first from God, before from the creature;</hi>—and moreover, <hi>l. 2. p.</hi> 3. denies, <hi>That God concurs only by a general concurſe;</hi> as the Sun concurs in the ſame manner to the generation of a man and horſe; but determines, <hi>that the influxe of God is ſpecial to ſpecial effects, as they are ſpecifically diſtinguiſhed, not morally but phyſically;</hi> yet he doth by many arguments contend and prove, <hi>that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion and predetermination of God,</hi> which the Schole of <hi>Thomas</hi> defendes,</q> 
                        <hi>to al and ſingular acts of the creature is not neceſſary.</hi> Note here, that albeit <hi>Strangius</hi> ſeems to differ from the Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, Remonſtrants, and <hi>Baronius</hi> in aſſerting Gods Concurſe to be previous, particular, and ſpecial; yet in that he denies Divine predetermination to al creatural acts, <hi>Le Blanc</hi> makes him not to differ much from the Moliniſts and Remonſtrants: which to me indeed is a great obſervation; for I am under a very ſtrong, and I am apt to perſuade my ſelf, rational preſumtion, that predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to good acts can never be rationally defended by theſe New Methodiſts, who denie predetermination to the ſubſtrate mater of al evil acts; as <hi>Strangius</hi> doth, <hi>pag.</hi> 167, 584. of which more hereafter, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. §. 4, 5.</p>

Thus they divide the battel between the Calviniſt and Arminian. But as <hi>Janſenius</hi> has wel obſerved out of <hi>Auguſtin, If there be the leaſt point granted to</hi> Pelagius, <hi>al wil be at laſt granted;</hi> ſo I am very apt to fear, that theſe New Methodiſts, by going ſo far in ſymboliſing with the Arminians, wil at laſt be wholly drawen over into their Campe.

                        <p>Arguments for Divine predetermination of the Wil to the entitative act of ſin.

                     <p>§. 1. HAving given a ſcriptural Demonſtration, as alſo the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous<note place="margin">Arguments for Predeterminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate mater of al ſin.</note> teſtimonie of ſuch as undertook to defend effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious Concurſe in al Ages of the Church, for the confirmation of our Hypotheſis, we now procede to demonſtrate the ſame by rational Arguments grounded on ſcriptural principes and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; which we ſhal reduce to the following Heads.</p>
                     <p>1. Arg. <hi>From the Futurition of althings in and by the Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Arg. from the futurition of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things.</note> which we thus forme: <hi>That which dependes on the Divine Decree for its futurition, neceſſarily fals under Divine predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to its exiſtence: But the ſubſtrate mater of al ſin dependes on the Divine Decree as to its futurition: therefore it neceſſarily fals under Divine predetermination as to its exiſtence.</hi> The major is granted by our Adverſaries, particularly by <hi>Strangius,</hi> who oft aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertes, <hi>That Divine Predetermination is exactly adequate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to Divine Predefinition;</hi> ſo that whatever is predefined by God in his Decree, muſt neceſſarily be predetermined by him in the execution and event. And what more rational than this aſſertion? Yea, what is predetermination of the event, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definition in the Decree? The difference between Gods eternal predefinition in the Decree, and predetermination as to actual concurſe and execution in time differ only as <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> Creation: as <hi>active</hi> Creation gives futurition to things, and <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,</hi> actual exiſtence; ſo <hi>predefinition</hi> and <hi>predetermination;</hi> and therefore among the Greeks one and the ſame Verbe <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſignifies both <hi>to predefine</hi> and <hi>predetermine.</hi> So that our major ſeems ſo clear as to carrie with it its own evidence. Wherefore we paſſe on to demonſtrate the minor, which our Adverſaries principally ſtrike at, and therefore needs our ſtrongeſt forces: This we ſhal endeavor to make good in and by the following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. (1) Prop. <hi>Nothing is or can be future in its own nature,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57509:80"/>
without ſome cauſe of its futurition.</hi> How is it poſſible that any thing ſhould paſſe from a ſtate of mere poſſibilitie, contingence, and indifference, but by ſome cauſe? Do not poſſible, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture differ? and muſt there not be ſome cauſe of this difference? (2) Prop. <hi>Whatever is the cauſe of futurition to any thing muſt be eternal.</hi> This is moſt evident; becauſe whatever is future was ſo from Eternitie; for God foreknew it to be ſo: otherwiſe, how could his knowlege be certain? Hence, (3) Prop. <hi>Nothing can give futurition to things but God.</hi> For is there any thing but God eternal? (4) Prop. <hi>Nothing in God gives futurition to things but his wil.</hi> His Eſſence ſimply conſidered cannot give futurition to things; becauſe <hi>poſſible</hi> and <hi>future</hi> are the ſame as to the Divine Eſſence: neither doth the Preſcience of God give futurition to things; for things are not future becauſe God foreknows them, but he therefore foreknows them becauſe future. Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that nothing but the Divine wil can give futurition to things, as <hi>Court Gent. P. 4. B. 2. C.</hi> 11. §. 9. whence alſo it neceſſarily follows, (5) <hi>That the futurition of the ſubſtrate mater of al ſin is from the Divine wil and decree.</hi> For what can make ſinful acts fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſo the object of Divine foreknowlege, but the wil of God, which gives futurition to althings? And if Gods predefining decreeing wil give futurition to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin, muſt not his predeterminative wil alſo give exiſtence to it?</p>
                     <p>But let us examine what aſſaults our Adverſaries make againſt<note place="margin">Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſolved.</note> this Argument by Reſponſes and Objections. (1) They replie to our minor, <hi>That the futurition of the ſubſtrate mater or entita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive act of ſin is not from the wil of God, but from the wil of man, that gives exiſtence to it.</hi> Thus <hi>Strangius, lib. 3. cap. 5. pag.</hi> 585. where he endeavors to prove, <hi>That it is not repugnant that ſomething ſhould be future, which God hath not abſolutely predefined, but left to the wil of man to effect.</hi> So <hi>cap. 9. pag.</hi> 628. he peremtorily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertes, <hi>That God hath not decreed al futures,</hi> namely, <hi>the Fal of</hi> Adam, <hi>or the ſin againſt the Holy Ghost,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>pag.</hi> 631. he ſaith, <hi>Nothing hinders, but that there may be ſome cauſe of the futurition of a thing beſides the Decree of God, namely the create wil.</hi> The like <hi>Le Blanc, Concord. Libert. Hum. p. 1. theſ.</hi> 55—57. where he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to prove, <hi>That what is the cauſe why things exiſte in time, the ſame is the cauſe of their futurition from Eternitie: but mans wil only is the cauſe why ſin exiſtes in time, ergo,</hi> &amp;c. A poor Reſponſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, or rather begging of the Queſtion! For is it poſſible that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57509:80"/>
the ſecond cauſe loged in time ſhould give futurition to a thing from Eternitie? Is it not an approved Maxime in Philoſophie, yea in Nature, that the cauſe is ever, at leaſt in order of nature, before the effect? and is the ſecond cauſe confined by time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eternal futurition of its effect? (2) But <hi>Le Blanc</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers hereto, <hi>theſ. 56. pag. 454. That Futurition is nothing elſe but a reſpect of reaſon, and an extrinſec denomination of the thing, which is ſaid to be future, not ſomething really diſtinct from the thing future,</hi> &amp;c. But the vanitie of this ſubterfuge is moſt evident; for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it follows, that the thing is not future before it is exiſtent: can a modal extrinſec denomination of a thing exiſte before the thing that gives it exiſtence? How many abſurdities would follow hereon?</p>
                     <p>But our Adverſaries have one grand Objection, which they lay much weight on, againſt our minor, and that is this: <hi>If the wil of God gives futurition to ſin, then ſin as future hath one and the ſame Idea with the wil of God: and ſo the futurition of ſin muſt be God.</hi> This objection is urged and adorned with many Trophies by <hi>Strangius, Le Blanc,</hi> and a Divine of name among us. So <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, lib. 3. cap. 9. pag.</hi> 631, 632. having <hi>pag.</hi> 626, &amp;c. recited <hi>Twiſſes</hi> argument <hi>from the eternal futurition of ſin,</hi> he replies thus: <hi>Herein,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>lies the whole force of the argument, that there can be no other cauſe of a futurition made from Eternitie, but what is eternal.</hi> To which he anſwers with a ſcoffe thus: <hi>A pretty argumentation indeed! why may we not by the ſame reaſon prove, that the futurition of ſin is God?</hi> The ſame is urged by <hi>Le Blanc, de Concord. Libert. par. 1. theſ. 55, 56. pag.</hi> 454. where he endeavors to prove againſt <hi>Twiſſe, That if the futurition of ſin be from the wil of God, it is God; which makes God manifeſtly the Author of ſin.</hi> The ſame is urged by a Divine of ſome note among us. But in anſwer hereto, I muſt confeſſe, I cannot but marvel at the confidence of perſons ſo learned, and in other points judicious, on ſuch infirme and rotten grounds: For when we ſpeak of the futurition of ſin, which is a complexe aggregate thing, we muſt diſtinguiſh its <hi>material</hi> from its <hi>formal</hi> part. (1) If we ſpeak of the <hi>material entitative part of ſin,</hi> which is in itſelf a natural good, ſo we may without the leaſt violation of Gods ſacred Majeſtie affirme, that its futurition is the ſame, or not really diſtinct from Gods wil the cauſe thereof: and why not? is not the futurition of al natural Beings good? And whence procedes al good but from the immenſe Ocean of good?
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57509:81"/>
Yea, was not al good from Eternitie loged in the boſome of God, and ſonot really diſtinct from him? So that indeed this objection of <hi>Strangius</hi> and <hi>Le Blanc</hi> againſt the futurition of the material entitative act of ſin from the wil of God ſtrikes at the futurition of althings, even the moſt gratioſe acts from the ſame wil: for if the futurition of any one natural act may be reſolved into the wil of man as its firſt cauſe, why may not the futurition of al grace be as wel reſolved into the ſame human wil, ſpecially in <hi>Adams</hi> innocent ſtate, who had then perfect free-wil? But yet (2) if we ſpeak of the futurition of ſin in regard of its <hi>formal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> conſiſting in its vitioſitie and obliquitie, ſo we utterly denie, that its futurition is the ſame with God: for the futurition of ſin as to its vitioſitie is not from the effective wil of God, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive; God decrees to effect the entitative act, but only to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the vitioſitie appendent thereto, which follows on the act, as other privations do on the abſence of their habit. To make this evident by a parallel inſtance; God decrees the diurnal motion of the Sun, and that at night it ſhal retire into the other Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, whence darkneſſe neceſſarily follows: may we thence argue, that the futurition of darkneſſe, or darkneſſe itſelf is the ſame with God? Would not any Freſh-man in Logic hiſſe ſuch a conſequence out of the Scholes? And yet who dares denie, but that the retirement of the Sun out of this Hemiſphere into the other is from God, as alſo its futurition? The like may be inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in al other privations, which have no real being, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no real efficient of their exiſtence or futurition: for nothing can admit a real efficient cauſe of its futurition, but what has a real efficient cauſe of its exiſtence: what is the firſt efficient of the exiſtence of things? Is it not the wil of God? and is it not alſo the ſame Divine wil that gives futurition to things? Yea doth not the very ſame act or decree of the Divine wil that gives real Beings their futurition, give them alſo, in their appointed periods of time, their exiſtence? So that in this regard the Rule of <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> and <hi>Le Blanc</hi> is moſt true, That the ſame cauſe that gives things their exiſtence, gives them alſo their futurition: this I ſay holds true of the firſt cauſe, but not of ſecond cauſes, as they would needs perſuade us. So that, to conclude this argument, in as much as the wil of God gives futurition to al ſin, the effective wil of God to the entitative act or ſubſtrate mater of ſin, and the permiſſive wil of God to the formal reaſon, or vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57509:81"/>
of ſin, hence it neceſſarily follows, that the predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Concurſe of God, (whereby I underſtand nothing elſe but the Efficacious Divine Wil as operative) gives exiſtence to the ſubſtrate mater of Sin.</p>
                     <p>§. 2. Our ſecond Argument ſhal be taken from the <hi>certitude</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 <hi>Arg.</hi> from the Certitude of Divine Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> 
                        <hi>of Gods Preſcience;</hi> and we may forme it thus: <hi>God can certainly foreknow nothing, but what he certainly decrees, predefines, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determines to be: But God certainly foreknows al ſin.</hi> Ergo. The Minor is granted by our Adverſaries and denied by none, that I know, except Atheiſts and Socinians: Thus <hi>Job 34. 21. For his eyes are upon the wayes of man and he ſeeth al his goings.</hi> Our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal worke therefore wil be to make good our Major; which we dout not but to performe in and by the following Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: (1) Prop. <hi>Nothing can be certainly foreknown by God, but what has ſome certain Reaſons, Principes, and Cauſes of ſuch a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.</hi> Now there are three cauſes that give certitude to al Science and Preſcience: [1] <hi>A certitude of the Object:</hi> for if the object be uncertain, the Science can never be certain: can the Structure or Edifice be firme, if the foundation be infirme? [2] <hi>A certain Medium,</hi> which is the principal fundamen of al Science. [3]<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>A certitude of the Subject:</hi> for be the Object and Medium never ſo certain, yet there can be no certain Science, unleſs the Subject apprehend the ſame. And doth not the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of God include al theſe degrees of Certitude? Muſt there not be a certitude of the Object, Medium, and Subject? (2) Prop. <hi>The Divine Preſcience as to future ſins admits not any of theſe degrees of certitude, but as originated from the Divine Wil and Decree.</hi> [1] How can Sin as the Object of Divine Preſcience be certainly future, but by the efficacious Wil of God making it ſo? [2] What certain Medium can there be of Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but the divine Wil and Decree? [3] And thence, how can God have a ſubjective Certitude of ſin but in and by his own Wil? Hence, (3) Prop. <hi>Gods certain Preſcience of Sin infers alſo a certain predefinition and predetermination of the ſubſtrate mater of Sin. That God knows nothing future but by his decree making it future,</hi> has been the perſuaſion not only of Calviniſts, but alſo of the moſt ſober Scholemen in al Ages, <hi>Scotus, Ricardus, Hervaeus, Bradwardine, Johannes Major,</hi> and others not a few, as <hi>Le Blanc, de Concord. Libert. Par. 3. Theſ. 33. p.</hi> 443. confeſſeth. Yea, <hi>Strangius</hi> himſelf grants <hi>the futurition of Sin in Gods Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:57509:82"/>
as <hi>l. 3. c. 9. p.</hi> 640. Yea, <hi>Le Blanc, De Concord. Libert. Hum. Par. 1. Theſ.</hi> 59. &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 455. proves ſtrongly, <hi>That according to Strangius's opinion, there can no contingent</hi> [i. e. ſinful act] <hi>be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known by God as abſolutely future, but what God firſt decreed to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely future.</hi> His words are theſe: <q>But ſome alſo of thoſe who hold ſome free acts of God to be abſolutely future, and as ſuch to be foreknown by God, without any Decree predetermining the free cauſes to thoſe acts, as Learned <hi>Strangius,</hi> yet denie, that free future contingents may be known by God according to any Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, which doth not include an abſolute Decree concerning their futurition: as <hi>Strang. de Volunt. l. 3. c.</hi> 11. His reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing can be certainly known, but what is certainly true: but nothing is certainly true, but what is neceſſary either abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely or conditionally. Whence he collects, that future condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionates cannot be the Object of divine Science, which is infallible and moſt certain, unleſſe there be included the condition, whence that which is ſaid to be future may be certainly inferred. But if this reaſon prevails, God can foreknow nothing contingent as abſolutely future, but what he before decreed as abſolutely future; which yet <hi>Strangius</hi> admits not, who confeſſeth, that men act many things freely to which they are not predetermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God.</q> Thus <hi>Le Blanc</hi> of <hi>Strangius</hi>'s ſelf-contradicting Hypotheſis. And indeed, to ſpeak the truth nakedly, there ſeems ſo much force in <hi>Strangius</hi>'s reaſon, whereby he proves, <hi>That al Gods Preſcience of free future Contingents includes an abſolute Decree of their futurition,</hi> namely from the certainty of divine Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that I no way wonder that he urgeth the ſame, albeit to the ſubverſion of his own <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> And I am very bold, yea confident in aſſerting, and demonſtrating theſe following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. (1) Prop. <hi>That God can have no certain Preſcience of things future, but from his own decree, the only certain determinate cauſe of their futurition.</hi> And therefore the Socinians denying a certain determinate Cauſe of things contingent, denie alſo Gods Preſcience to be certain, as <hi>Le Blanc, De Concord. P. 3. Theſ. 1. p.</hi> 438. and I cannot ſee how any can rationally avoid the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> objection, who do not reſolve the certitude of the divine Preſcience into the divine Decree. Hence, (2) Prop. <hi>There is an hypothetic or conſequential neceſſitie that ariſeth from Gods certain Preſcience.</hi> This is wel urged, though in the defenſe of an hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Hypotheſis, by the Socinians, and cited by <hi>Le Blanc</hi> (as a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57509:82"/>
knot not eaſily untied) <hi>de Concord. Par. 3. Theſ.</hi> 22. pag. 441. <q>There is, ſaith he, much of difficultie here, which in times paſt has exerciſed the ingenies of Doctors. For ſeeing it is impoſſible, that the Preſcience of God may be deceived, it cannot be but that thoſe things muſt happen, which God foreſees wil happen; and therefore that althings happen neceſſarily: and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, but that the very wil of man muſt produce thoſe acts, which God from eternity foreknew it would produce.</q> This Objection I deſpair ever to ſee rationally anſwered by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries without contradicting their own Hypotheſis. See more of this <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. §. 5. Hence (3) Prop. <hi>The ſame arguments that are urged by our Opponents againſt Gods predetermining the Wil to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin, may be, as they are by the Socinians, urged with as great force againſt Gods certain Preſcience of Sin.</hi> For our Adverſaries, <hi>Strangius, Le Blanc,</hi> &amp;c. granting the certain futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition of ſin in the eternal Preſcience of God, fal under al thoſe Imputations and black Conſequences which they charge on us, who aſſert the predefinition, futurition, and predetermination of the ſubſtrate mater of Sin in the divine Decree. This Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is incomparably wel demonſtrated by judicious <hi>Davenant,</hi> in his <hi>Animadverſions on Gods Love to Mankind,</hi> p. 418, 419, 442, 462. where he proves, That <hi>Infallible Preſcience granted by the Arminians, infers as much neceſſitie on the Wil, as abſolute Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination and Reprobation.</hi> Of which more in our next Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; alſo <hi>c.</hi> 6. §. 5.</p>
                     <p>Let us now a little inquire into the Subterfuges which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries take Sanctuarie in to ſecure themſelves from the force of this Argument taken from Divine Preſcience. And here at what a miſerable loſſe and confuſion are they among themſelves? How few of them agree on any one Principe or Medium for the ſolving this argument? Some flie for refuge to the Moliniſts <hi>Middle Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> telling us, <hi>That God foreſaw that men being placed under ſuch hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes, and circumſtances, would ſin againſt him,</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>Baronius, Metaphyſ. Sect. 12. Diſp. 2. n.</hi> 55, 56. p. 326. where he profeſſedly defendes <hi>Fonſeca</hi>'s <hi>conditionate Science,</hi> making <hi>God to have a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate Science of the firſt ſin, if</hi> Eve <hi>ſeduced by the Serpent ſhould temt</hi> Adam, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus alſo one and another Divine of good note among us. But this ſubterfuge is greatly diſliked by the more fober of this new Method, particularly by <hi>Strangius;</hi> who, <hi>l. 3. c. 11. p.</hi> 651. proves nervo<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>. That there can be no ſuch thing as a <hi>Middle</hi>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:57509:83"/>
or <hi>conditionate Science in God, becauſe its Object is not certainly Cognoſcible, or Knowable:</hi> and this he proves; <hi>becauſe an object cannot be certainly knowen, unleſſe it be certainly true: which the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this conditionate Middle Science is not.</hi> Thus alſo <hi>Le Blanc, De Concord. Libert. Par.</hi> 1. p. 452, &amp;c. Others therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the infirmitude of this evaſion, have recourſe to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans <hi>real preſence of things future in Eternitie;</hi> whereby they make <hi>God, by his Science of Viſion, to behold the ſins of men.</hi> Thus <hi>Strangius, l. 3. c. 10. p. 646. If it be demanded,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to what Science Gods Knowledge of Sins muſt be referred, I eaſily grant that it is to be referred to his Science of Viſion,</hi> &amp;c. But more fully, <hi>l. 3. c. 7. p. 594. Among al the modes which are wont to be explicated, there is none more probable than that which is taken from the preſence of althings in Eternitie; becauſe the Eternitie of God is Inſucceſſive and Indiviſible.</hi> The ſame he inculcates, <hi>p.</hi> 595, 596, 597. But this mode alſo of ſolving the difficultie, is greatly oppoſed, by ſome of his own party, the New Methodiſts, who take ſome pains to ſhew the invaliditie thereof. So <hi>Le Blanc, De Concord.

Firſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as for that real preſence of futures in Eternitie, namely as they are ſuppoſed to coexiſte from eternitie to eternitie it ſelf, it appears to be a mere figment; for that one thing coexiſte to another, it is neceſſary that both exiſte,</hi> &amp;c. Thus alſo a learned and pious Divine among our ſelves, who has eſpouſed <hi>Strangius</hi>'s Hypotheſis, fals ſoul on the Thomiſts for aſſerting, <hi>Althings to be eternally preſent to the divine Intellect in eſſe reali,</hi> &amp;c. Laſtly, others therefore to evade the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned inconveniences, take up their refuge under <hi>the Infinitie of Gods Preſcience.</hi> Thus <hi>Le Blanc, De Concord.</hi> Par. 1. Theſ. 40. p. 444. <hi>As for the fourth opinion, which ſeeks the certitude of the divine Preſcience in the infinitie of the divine Intellect, and in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate truth of thoſe things which are contingently future, it eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth nothing but what is certain and indubitable,</hi> &amp;c. Yet he grants, Theſ. 41. <hi>That albeit this opinion contains in it nothing but truth, yet it doth not ſatisfie the Queſtion, nor remove the main diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,</hi> namely, <hi>How things paſſe from a ſtate of poſſibilitie to a ſtate of futurition,</hi> &amp;c. Whence he concludes, Theſ. 43. <hi>Sithat there is ſo much darkneſſe on every ſide, there is nothing more ſafe than to profeſſe our Ignorance in this particular.</hi> And this indeed is the beſt refuge theſe New Methodiſts have, when they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves involved in ſo many ſelf-contradictions, and abſurdities,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57509:83"/>
to profeſſe their Ignorance as to the Mode of Divine Preſcience. Yea, ſome of them procede ſo far in this pretended modeſtie, as to profeſſe, <hi>That the mode of Divine Preſcience is not determined in Scripture.</hi> Thus <hi>Strangius, l. 3. c. 5. p. 576. That God is omniſcient is put out of dout, but touching the mode and manner of Preſcience nothing is expreſſely delivered in Scripture.</hi> The like others. But is it ſo indeed? Doth not the Scripture declare expreſſely the mode of Preſcience? Why then (1) are our Adverſaries ſo dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic and poſitive in their new modes and meaſures of Divine Preſcience, contrary to the received Sentiments of the Church in al Ages? How comes it to paſſe, that they contend with ſo much heat and paſſion, for that which they confeſſe is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely delivered in Scripture? Were not a modeſt <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> or <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> of aſſent more agreeable to ſuch a Confeſſion? But (2) We eaſily grant them, that the mode of Divine Preſcience is unſearchable and paſt finding out, as indeed al Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are, but yet muſt we thence neceſſarily conclude, <hi>that nothing</hi> of the mode of Divine Preſcience is expreſſely delivered in Scripture? [1] Doth not the Scripture evidently declare, That the mode of Gods Preſcience is far above yea oppoſite to that of Mans ſcience, as much as Heaven is above the Earth, yea infinitely more? [2] Doth not the Scripture alſo remove from the mode of Divine Preſcience al manner of Imperfections, much more Contradictions? And is not the mode of Gods Preſcience in his own Eſſence and Decrees, much more perfect than that which makes his Infallible immutable Preſcience dependent on the mutable fallible Wil of Man? But ſee more hereof, <hi>Court Gent. P. 4. B. 2. c.</hi> 5. §. 2.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. We paſſe on to our third Argument, which ſhal be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<note place="margin">3 <hi>Arg.</hi> from the Decree of Reprobation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> from <hi>the Divine Wil and Decrees;</hi> and more particularly from <hi>the Decree of Reprobation.</hi> And here we ſhal lay down this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe, which is granted by <hi>Strangius,</hi> and others of the New Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, <hi>That Divine Predetermination is adequate and commenſurate to Divine Predefinition</hi> or <hi>Predeſtination.</hi> So <hi>Strangius, l. 3. c. 2. p. 547. We eaſily grant,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the predefinition of God from eternitie, and the predetermination of the create wil in time, mutually follow each other, ſo that if God doth abſolutely predefine any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and ſingular act to be brought about by us, he muſt alſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our Wil to the ſame.</hi> This he inculcates, <hi>c. 5. p.</hi> 584. Now this ingenuous Conceſſion is as much as we deſire to build our
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57509:84"/>
Demonſtration on: for we no way dout but to demonſtrate, <hi>That God doth abſolutely predefine the material entitative act of Sin:</hi> Which we ſhal endeavour to make good in the following Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. (1) Prop. <hi>Reprobation admits no formal motive, proper condition or cauſe.</hi> This Propoſition is generally denyed by the New Methodiſts, who grant, <hi>That God decrees al good abſolutely, but as for Sin,</hi> ſay they, <hi>God decrees that only reſpectively and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally.</hi> So <hi>Strangius,</hi> l. 3. c. 2. p. 546-548. But we no way dout, but, before we have finiſht this Demonſtration, to make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Gods Decree of Reprobation, whereby he determines to leave men to ſin, is abſolute, as wel as the Decree of Election: Yea, it is to me a thing altogether impoſſible, to defend an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Decree of Election, and yet to make the Decree of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation conditional and reſpective: for if the abſolute good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God be the only cauſe why ſome are elected, muſt it not alſo be the only cauſe why others are rejected? Doth not the Election of the one neceſſarily implie the Reprobation of the other? It's true, our Divines, that follow the Sublapſarian mode, as <hi>Davenant,</hi> &amp;c. ſpeak of Sin as a commun condition belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the whole maſſe of corrupt nature, yet they allow not of any <hi>diſtinctive condition</hi> or <hi>formal cauſe</hi> or motive, which ſhould incline the divine wil to reprobate one rather than another: for nothing can move the divine Wil, but what is ſome way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to it: Now the conſideration of al ſin is ſubſequent to ſome act of Gods Wil. (2) Prop. <hi>The act of Reprobation is not merely negative, but poſitive and efficacious.</hi> It's granted, that ſome of our Divines make mention of a negative act of Reprobation, which they terme <hi>Non-election,</hi> or <hi>Preterition,</hi> yet hereby they intend not a <hi>ſuſpenſe act</hi> of the Divine wil, but include alſo a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive efficacious act. Thus <hi>Janſenius, Auguſt. de Grat. Chriſti, l. 10. c. 2. pag.</hi> 420. proves out of <hi>Auguſtin, That Gods negative Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is poſitive.</hi> So <hi>Davenant, Diſſert. de Elect. &amp; Reprob.</hi> p. 113. <hi>But we muſt take heed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>leſt with</hi> Scotus <hi>we think, that the Wil of God in regard of Reprobates, which he electes not but paſſeth by, is merely negative: for in this very act, which we expreſſe by a Negation, is contained an expreſſe and affirmate Wil of God.</hi> So in his <hi>Determinations,</hi> Quaeſt. 25. <hi>p.</hi> 117. he tels us, <hi>That it's moſt certain, there can be no Decree permitting ſin, to which there doth not adhere ſome efficacious Decree.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 118. he inſtructs us, <hi>That this Decree of permitting ſin is efficacious, not in a way of effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57509:84"/>
but by directing and ordaining to extract good out of evil.</hi> (3) Prop. <hi>In the mater of Reprobation God is conſidered as a ſoverain Abſolute Lord, not as a Righteous Judge.</hi> The Pelagians, Moliniſts, Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, and New Methodiſts conſider God in the act of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a juſt Judge, not as a ſupreme abſolute Lord: whence they conclude, that it is unjuſt with God to reprobate any but on the previſion of their ſins; not conſidering, that Reprobation is not an act inflicting puniſhment, but of denying Benefits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Libertie and Dominion of God is only to be attended; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 9. 21. Has not the Potter power over the clay,</hi> &amp;c? What is ſoverain Dominion, but an abſolute right to diſpoſe of what is our own? And ſhal we not allow the ſame Dominion to God, which is allowed to the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter over his Clay? Is the ſoverain Lord tied to his Creature by any Law, more than what is in his own nature and wil? Hence it follows, (4) <hi>That the Decree of Reprobation is moſt abſolute and Independent as to al diſtinctive conditions or cauſes in man.</hi> Thus <hi>Janſenius, Auguſt. de Grat. Chriſti,</hi> l. 10. c. 4. p. 423. proves out of <hi>Auguſtin, That the abſolute Wil of God is the alone cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</hi> And <hi>Auguſtin</hi> complains, <hi>That it is a great injurie to God, when men ſearch for cauſes of things ſuperior to his ſoverain Wil: for his Wil is ſuch a ſupreme Rule of Juſtice, as that whatever he wils is for that very reaſon, becauſe he wils it, to be accounted juſt.</hi> So <hi>Bradwardine, de Cauſa Dei,</hi> l. 1. c. 47. proves ſtrongly, <hi>That albeit God puniſheth no man eternally without ſin committed in time; yet he doth not eternally reprobate any for ſin as a Cauſe antecedently moving his divine Wil.</hi> So <hi>Alvarez, de Auxil. Diſput.</hi> 109. 3<hi rend="sup">a</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſ. <hi>The poſitive act, whereby God from eternitie would not admit ſome into his Kingdome, was not conditionate, but abſolute, antecedent, in a moment of Reaſon, to the il uſe of Free-wil. And it is proved, [1] Becauſe there can be no cauſe of Reprobation. [2] Becauſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Beatitude is not due to any upon the account of natural improvements: Therefore God could from al eternitie without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie, before the Preſcience of the good or il uſe of free-wil, elect ſome to life eternal, and by a poſitive act wil not to admit others.</hi> And our Divines generally grant, <hi>That there can be no other cauſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned of Reprobation, than the abſolute <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Divine concurſe, albeit it be univerſal as to the extent of its object, yet it's moſt particular and proper as to its manner of working. Our Adverſaries generally, both
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57509:86"/>
Pelagians, Moliniſts, Arminians, and New Methodiſts talke much of a general indifferent concurſe, alike commun to al effects, and determinable by its ſubſtrate mater; as the general influence of the Sun is determinable by the mater it workes on. But, alas! how unbecoming and incongruous to the Divine perfections is ſuch a general indifferent concurſe? Doth not this make the firſt cauſe to be ſecond, becauſe dependent; and the ſecond cauſe firſt, becauſe independent? And doth it not hence alſo neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the firſt cauſe may, by the indiſpoſition of the mater or reſiſtence of ſecond Agents, be fruſtrated of its intended effect? What more expreſſely overthrows the ſoverain Dominion and univerſal Concurſe of God, than ſuch a general indifferent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe? And yet is not this one of the moſt plauſible ſubterfuges our Adverſaries have to ſhelter themſelves under? They object, If God ſhould by a particular predeterminative concurſe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the wil to act in ſins intrinſecally evil, as the hatred of God, or the like, then the ſpecification of the act and moral determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it to its particular object would be from God; and ſo God inevitably ſhould be the Author of ſin. This is their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and indeed their only objection worth a naming againſt our Hypotheſis; to which we intend a more ful anſwer in the next Chapter, §. 1. at preſent let this ſuffice, [1] We ſay not, that God is a <hi>particular cauſe,</hi> but <hi>univerſal,</hi> working in and by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular concurſe ſuitable to the indigence of the mater it workes on. [2] We ſay not, that this particular Concurſe of God doth <hi>morally ſpecifie,</hi> or determine the ſinful act to its object, but only phyſically individuate or naturally modifie the ſubſtrate mater of the ſinful act. This is incomparably wel explicated by Dr. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Ward,</hi> that great Profeſſor of Theologie, in his Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Concurſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 117. where he ſtrongly demonſtrates, <hi>That the previous Concurſe of God, as the firſt cauſe, doth in its way modifie and determine al the actions of ſecond cauſes:</hi> and if ſo, then ſurely the ſubſtrate entitative act of ſin, as hereafter. [3] That general indifferent concurſe, which our Adverſaries ſo warmly contend for, ſithat they grant it to be cauſative and influential on the ſinful act, doth equally infer God to be the Author of ſin, as our predeter minative concurſe. For if it be cauſative and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of the act, then ſurely of that individual act, as determined to ſuch an object: for to talke of its concurrence to the act <hi>in genere, in the general,</hi> and not <hi>in individuo,</hi> in its individual deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57509:87"/>
to its object, is ſuch an abſurditie in Philoſophie, that al awakened Philoſophers wil decrie it: for what Tyro cannot informe us, that al phyſical acts are <hi>ſuppoſitorum, of individual ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſubſtances,</hi> and ſo without al peradventure individual and ſingular: and if ſo, then muſt not their general concurſe reach not only the action in general, but alſo individually conſidered, as relating to its object, not <hi>morally,</hi> but <hi>phyſically?</hi> And wil it not hence follow, that their general concurſe is cauſative of the enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative act, as determined to its object, and ſo makes God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſin, as much, at leaſt as wel as our predeterminative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe, as more fully <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. §. 1.

                     <p>(4) The <hi>Immediation</hi> of Divine Concurſe ſtrongly demonſtrates<note place="margin">4. Immediation.</note> the predetermination of the wil as to the entitative act of ſin thereby. Our Adverſaries generally, both Jeſuites, Arminians, and new Methodiſts, excepting ſome very few that adhere to <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus,</hi> grant an immediate concurſe to the entitative act of ſin; which if wel followed wil neceſſarily infer predeterminative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe, ſpecially according to the conceſſions of the new Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts; who ſay, <hi>That this immediate concurſe reacheth not only the effect and act,</hi> (which the Jeſuites and Arminians grant) but alſo the very wil itſelf, as the immediate efficient of the act. Touching this immediate Concurſe ſee <hi>Strangius, lib. 1. cap. 10. pag.</hi> 54, &amp;c. &amp; <hi>lib. 2. cap. 5. pag.</hi> 163. And among the Jeſuites none has more acutely demonſtrated this, than <hi>Suarez, Metaphyſ. Diſp. 22. Sect.</hi> 1. and our Country-man <hi>Campton Carleton,</hi> in his <hi>Philoſ. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſ. Diſp. 28. Sect. 2, 3. pag.</hi> &amp; <hi>Diſput. 29. Sect. 1, 2. pag.</hi> 323, 324. where he demonſtrates ſtrongly, againſt <hi>Lud. à Dola, That God immediately together with the creature produceth the very act of ſin.</hi> Now hence we thus argue: If God, together with the human wil, immediately produceth the very act of ſin, then certainly he muſt of neceſſitie predetermine the wil to that entitative act: For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſinful act be <hi>motus primò primus,</hi> as they phraſe it, or a mere ſimple volition of the wil, how is it poſſible, that God ſhould immediately produce this act of the wil, without applying the wil to the act? Do not the very Jeſuites, <hi>Suarez, Carleton,</hi> with others grant, <hi>That one and the ſame ſinful act is produced by God and the human wil?</hi> And doth not <hi>Strangius</hi> with others of the New Methodiſts alſo acknowlege further, <hi>That Gods Concurſe to this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful act of the wil is previous to that of the wil, not only ſimultaneous,</hi> as
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57509:87"/>
                        <hi>Strang. lib. 1. cap. 10. pag.</hi> 56? Yea <hi>Strangius</hi> and thoſe of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion grant yet more, <hi>That Gods immediate concurſe reacheth not only the act and effect, but alſo the wil itſelf,</hi> as <hi>Strang. pag.</hi> 171. And is it not moſt evident, from theſe ingenuous conceſſions of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, touching immediate concurſe, that God doth predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the wil to the entitative act of ſin? Can we imagine, that one and the ſame ſinful act ſhould be produced immediately by God and the human wil, and yet God not applie the wil to its act, which is al that is meant by predetermination? Yea, doth God not only concur with the wil to one and the ſame act, but alſo influence the wil in the production of that act, as <hi>Strangius</hi> and others grant, and yet not applie it to act? How is it poſſible, that God ſhould influence the wil in the production of any act, without actuating or drawing forth the wil to act? And if God actuate or draw forth the wil to act, doth he not applie it to the act, and ſo predetermine the ſame? Again, doth God by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate concurſe not only influence the wil and its act, but alſo antecedently and in a moment of reaſon and cauſalitie before the wil concurs to its own act, as <hi>Strangius</hi> alſo grants? and doth not this give us a more abundant demonſtration, that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determines the wil to that act? Can there be any previous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe immediately actuating and influencing the wil in its act, but what is predeterminative? Doth not the wil neceſſarily depend on the previous concurſe of the firſt cauſe? and if ſo, muſt it not be applied and predetermined to its act thereby? But more of this previous concurſe in our next Argument. Laſtly, if we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low (with the Jeſuites) unto God only an immediate concurſe to the act of the wil, al thoſe black conſequences which our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries caſt on the Aſſertors of predetermination, may with the ſame facilitie be reflected on them: for if they make God, by an immediate concurſe to concur to the act of ſin, do they not make him the cauſe and ſo the Author of ſin as wel as we?

Prioritie.</note> demonſtrate its predetermining the wil as to the ſubſtrate mater of ſinful acts. We ſhal here reaſſume a Principe already eſtabliſhed, and granted by Jeſuites and New Methodiſts, namely, <hi>That the action of the firſt cauſe concurring with the ſecond, is not, as to paſſive attingence, diſtinct from the action of the ſecond cauſe.</hi> This is generally granted by the Moliniſts, as <hi>Le Blanc, Concil.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57509:88"/>
Arbitr. par. 3. theſ. 28. pag.</hi> 433. and by <hi>Janſenius, Auguſt. tom. 1. lib. 5. cap. 20. pag.</hi> 119. It's true, the Concurſe of God the firſt cauſe is really different from that of the ſecond, as to <hi>active attin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> or principe, becauſe Gods concurſe, actively conſidered, is the ſame with his wil; yet as to <hi>paſſive attingence,</hi> the action and effect produced by God differ not from the action and effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the ſecond cauſe. This being premiſſed, we procede to demonſtrate Divine predetermination to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin from the prioritie and antecedence of Divine concurſe, and that in and by the following Propoſitions. (1) Prop. <hi>The first cauſe doth in order of nature or cauſalitie concur before the ſecond.</hi> This Propoſition is potently demonſtrated by the acute Dr. <hi>Sam. Ward, Determinat. de Concurſ. Dei, pag.</hi> 116, &amp;c. And the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for it are invict: for [1] where there is ſubordination and dependence in cauſalitie, which is proper to every ſecond cauſe, there poſterioritie is eſſentially appendent. Again, [2] al ſecond cauſes in regard of God are but inſtruments, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> proves: yea the wil of man as dependent on God is but a vital inſtrument, albeit in regard of the effect it may ſometimes be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a principal Agent: Now doth not every inſtrument ſubſerve the principal Efficient? And doth not that which is ſubſervient in order of cauſalitie move after that which is the principal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent? But here we are to remember, that when we aſſert Gods Concurſe to be <hi>previous</hi> in regard of its principe and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we denie not, but that it is alſo <hi>ſimultaneous</hi> in regard of the action and effect produced by the ſecond cauſe, as <hi>Alvarez, lib. 3. de Auxil. Diſput. 19. num.</hi> 4. &amp; <hi>Twiſſe, Vind. Grat. lib. 2. de Criminat. part. 3. pag.</hi> 56. But that which we denie is, <hi>That Gods Concurſe is ſolely concomitant and ſimultaneous;</hi> and that [3] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this ſimultaneous concurſe makes God only a partial cauſe, and dependent on the ſecond cauſe in the production of its effect. Yea, ſome of the Jeſuites grant, That if we conſider the concurſe of God abſolutely, without reſpect to this or that ſecond cauſe, ſo it is in order of nature before the influxe of the ſecond cauſe. So <hi>Fonſeca, Metaphyſ. lib. 6. cap. 2. quaeſt. 5. ſect.</hi> 13. The like <hi>Strangius, lib. 1. cap. 11. pag.</hi> 60, 61. Thus alſo <hi>Burgerſdicius, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſ. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 11. grants, Gods concurſe in ſupernaturals to be <hi>previous,</hi> albeit in naturals he would have it to be only <hi>ſimultane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi> which is moſt abſurd: for the active concurſe of God, being nothing elſe but the immanent act of his wil, muſt neceſſarily be
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57509:88"/>
the ſame in naturals as in ſupernaturals. More of the prioritie and Antecedence of the Divine Concurſe, ſee <hi>Court Gent. P. 4. B. 2. c. 7. §. 4. p.</hi> 416. Hence, (2) Prop. <hi>This previous Concurſe of God as the firſt Cauſe muſt neceſſarily move and applie every ſecond cauſe to its act and effect.</hi> For how is it poſſible, that the ſecond cauſe ſhould act, unleſſe the firſt move and applie it to its act? Can a ſecond cauſe move it ſelf to an act, unleſſe it be firſt moved thereto by the firſt cauſe? Whence, (3) Prop. <hi>This previous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe of God in applying and moving the Wil of man to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin predetermines the ſame.</hi> For if one and the ſame ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful action be produced by God and the human Wil, and God concurs in order of nature before the wil, yea premove and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie it to the act, muſt he not neceſſarily predetermine the ſame? Al the wit and ſubtilitie of our Adverſaries wil never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate themſelves or ſatisfie any awakened mind in this point, <hi>How God doth by a previous concurſe move and actuate the Wil, and yet not predetermine it to the act.</hi> Indeed to ſpeak the truth, the Sentiments not only of the Arminians, but alſo of the new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts, <hi>Baronius, Strangius</hi> and others about Concurſe, fal in with thoſe of the Jeſuites for a <hi>ſimultaneous Concurſe</hi> only, albeit ſome of them in termes diſown it.</p>
                     <p>(6) Laſtly, the <hi>ſoverain and abſolute Independence</hi> of Gods Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe<note place="margin">6. Abſolute In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence.</note> gives us further demonſtration of his predetermining the wil as to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin. That Gods Concurſe is not <hi>Conditionate</hi> but <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>independent,</hi> we have copioſely proved, <hi>Court Gent. P. 4. B. 2. c. 7. §. 4. p. 412, &amp;c.</hi> And indeed, what more abſurd, yea impoſſible, than ſuch a conditionate Concurſe, whereby the Moliniſts and Arminians ſuppoſe Gods concurrence to depend on mans? Is there not hereby an effectual dore open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a progreſſe into infinite? For if God concur on condition that man concur, doth God concur to that condition, or not? If not, is there not then ſome act of the creature produced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods concurſe? If God concur to the working of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, then <hi>abſolutely,</hi> or <hi>conditionally:</hi> if <hi>abſolutely,</hi> then his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Concurſe is not conditional: if <hi>conditionally,</hi> then what an infinitude of Conditions will follow hence? We take it then for granted, that Gods Concurſe is not conditional, but abſolute and independent. And hence we thus argue: If God concur abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and independently to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin, then he doth predetermine the wil thereto: the conſequence is rational
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57509:89"/>
and clear: For where two Agents concur totally and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to one and the ſame action and effect, the one muſt neceſſarily depend on the other; and that which depends on another muſt be determined by that other: for every cauſe that is dependent on another, is ſo far as it depends thereon determinable thereby. It's true, natural corporeous effects have ſome dependence on the Sun, without being determined thereby, becauſe the Sun is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited cauſe, and has not efficace ſufficient to determine the mater is workes on, but is rather determined thereby, and ſo in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect dependent thereon: But as for God the firſt cauſe whoſe wil, the principe of his concurſe, is omnipotent and moſt effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, it's impoſſible, that he ſhould have any dependence on, or be any way determinable in his concurſe by the mater he workes on: he being the moſt univerſal cauſe, infinitely perfect, and void of al potentialitie or paſſive power muſt neceſſarily predetermine al ſecond cauſes to their acts, but be determined by none. But more of this in what immediately follows of the efficace of Gods Concurſe.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>1. We ſhal demonſtrate Divine predetermination to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate mater of ſin from the efficacitie of Divine concurſe as to al <hi>natural acts and effects;</hi> which evidently appears in the following particulars. (1) <hi>Gods concurſe to al phyſic or natural cauſes, moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and effects is moſt efficacious.</hi> This Propoſition the ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures do abundantly confirme, as <hi>Eſa. 26. 12.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57509:89"/>
of the Divine wil.</hi> For what is efficacious concurſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered actively, but the efficacitie of the Divine wil predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to act ſo or ſo? To preſume that active concurſe is any thing elſe but an immanent efficacious act of the Divine wil is to croſſe the mind of ſacred Scriptures and the moſt awakened Divines, as we have copioſely demonſtrated, <hi>Court Gent. P. 4. B. 2. C. 7. §. 3. (3) Gods wil being efficacious and determinate determines al ſecond cauſes to al their natural actions and effects.</hi> Is it not impoſſible, but that the wil of God being omnipotent and determined for the production of ſuch an action of mans wil, the ſaid action or effect muſt neceſſarily follow? Is not the wil of God ſufficiently potent to determine the wil of man in al its natural acts? Is not the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacitie of the Divine wil ſo great, that not only thoſe things are done, which God wils ſhal be done, but in that manner as he wils<note place="margin">Non ſolùm ſunt ea quae Deus vult fieri, ſed etiam eo modo fiunt quo Deus vult fieri, <hi>Strang. l. 2. c. 11. p.</hi> 266.</note> them? Doth not <hi>Strangius</hi> confeſſe ſo much <hi>lib. 1. cap. 10. pag. 55. &amp; lib. 2. cap. 11. pag.</hi> 266.? Whence if God in his own wil pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and determine, that the human wil ſhould produce ſuch or ſuch an action, ſuppoſe that whereto ſin is neceſſarily annexed, is not the human wil neceſſarily in regard of the Divine wil, and yet freely in regard of its own manner of working predetermined thereto?

our Opponents grant, That Gods efficacious predetermining Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe extendes it ſelf not only to al ſupernatural good, but alſo to al natural good, that has not ſin intrinſecally annexed to it: whence we may, by a paritie of reaſon demonſtrate divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination to the ſubſtrate mater of al actions, though never ſo intrinſecally evil: for the ſubſtrate mater of al actions though intrinſecally evil, is naturally good. Take the Hatred of God, which is reckoned to be an act moſt intrinſecally evil, and if we conſider it in its ſubſtrate mater or entitative act, ſo it is <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good,</hi> and if it were exerted againſt ſin, its proper object, it would be alſo <hi>morally good:</hi> So that indeed the ſubſtrate mater of bad and good actions is the ſame, namely ſome natural good, and Gods Concurſe to the one and other is the ſame. Yea this indeed is acknowledged by <hi>Strangius, l. 2. c. 3. p. 154.

                        <hi>in the ſame manner to generation from lawful Matrimonie and that from adulterie; becauſe the action on both ſides is phyſically of the ſame kind.</hi> A great conceſſion indeed, which would our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries fully come up unto, how ſoon and how eaſily might we put a period to this Controverſie? For if the ſame action may be, as to its ſubſtrate mater naturally good and ſinful, and both phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically of the ſame kind, and ſo Gods Concurſe to both the ſame, why then may not God be allowed to predetermine the wil to the ſubſtrate mater of that which is ſinful, as wel as to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate mater of that which is good? Surely if the action be, as to its ſubſtrate mater, in one and t'other naturally good, and phyſically of one and the ſame kind, there can be no rational account given, why God ſhould not predetermine the wil to the ſubſtrate mater of that which is evil, as wel as to that which is good. In ſhort, as there is no moral act ſo perfect in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſtate, but has ſome vitioſitie adherent to it, ſo there is no natural act ſo ſinful, but it has for its ſubſtrate mater ſome natural good: and as God by predetermining the wil to the moral good is no way the Author of the vitioſitie appendent to the act; ſo by predetermining it to the natural ſubſtrate mater of the ſinful act, he is as much exemted from being the Author of the ſin.

This Province we ſhal endeavor to make good by ſeveral Arguments, (1) From the Principe of al <hi>Predetermination:</hi> what is the principe of al Predetermination, but the omnipotent efficacious wil of God? And how are al Acts and Effects predetermined by the Divine Wil, but by an immutable predeterminative Decree, termed his <hi>Determinate Counſel,</hi> Act. 2. 23? which is ſaid, <hi>Act. 4. 28. to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determine</hi> the Crucifixion of Chriſt? Doth not therefore the ſame <hi>determinate Counſel</hi> or wil of God predetermine the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate mater of ſin, as wel as any act morally good? Is not then predetermination as to its <hi>active Attingence</hi> or principe one and the ſame, both as to natural and ſupernatural good, albeit as to its <hi>paſſive Attingence</hi> and effect it be greatly different? For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there be a double Concurſe required to ſupernatural good, one to the ſubſtrate mater, which is a natural good, and the other to the moral good, which is ſupernatural, but only a ſingle concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin; yet in point of efficace the predetermination to the later is equal to the former, as to Divine efficience: For there is as much power and efficace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to predetermine or premove the wil to the ſubſtrate mater, or natural entitative act of ſin, as there is to any ſupernatural good: both are alike facile to the divine omnipotent wil: and ſurely no reaſon can be given, why predetermination is neceſſary for the production of any gracious act, and not as neceſſary for the production of the entitative act of ſin: for the Wil of Man is equally uncapable of acting at al, as of acting graciouſly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Predetermination, whatever ſome may imagine to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                     <p>(2) From the ſubſtrate mater of al <hi>natural and ſupernatural good.</hi> Are not al gracious acts and habits loged in human nature? What is ſupernatural good but a ray of the divine Nature irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated into human Nature, and ſeated therein as its proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? Is not al grace a ſupernatural mode implanted in human nature? whence, if God by efficacious Grace predetermine the wil to receive any habitual infuſion, or act of Grace, muſt he not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57509:91"/>
alſo neceſſarily predetermine the wil to the natural act which is the ſubſtrate mater of that ſupernatural mode? And if God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determine the wil to the natural act of that which is good, muſt he not alſo predetermine it to the natural act of that which is evil? What difference can there be aſſigned between the natural act of Crucifying our Lord, which was intrinſecally evil, and that of crucifying the Thieves, which was a piece of Juſtice? Did not God then as much predetermine the former as the later? Yea, to raiſe this Argument higher, hath not the ſame ſubſtrate mater, which is ſupernaturally good and gracious as to its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſome modal vitioſitie and obliquitie appendent thereto in this imperfect ſtate? If then God predetermine the Wil to the ſubſtrate mater of that which is ſupernaturally good, muſt he not alſo neceſſarily predetermine it to the ſubſtrate mater of that which is alſo evil? I am not ignorant what is replied hereto, which we no way dout but wil prove invalid, and no better than ſmoke or vapor, when we come to enlarge more fully on this Argument, §. 5.</p>
                     <p>(3) We demonſtrate the neceſſitie of Divine Predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſubſtrate mater of what is ſinful, from the Invaliditie yea vanitie of thoſe reaſons which are urged by our Adverſaries againſt it, which do with as much force ſtrike at Predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what is ſupernaturally good. [1] One principal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that our Adverſaries urge againſt predetermination to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin, ſpecially ſuch ſins as are intrinſecally evil, is <hi>That it deſtroyes the libertie of the Wil,</hi> &amp;c. We ſhal not now attemt any anſwer to the Objection, but reſerve it for its proper place, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. §. 5. only we are to ſhew, that the whole of this Objection, and the reaſons urged to enforce it, do with as much force ſtrike againſt al Predetermination, even that which is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſupernatural good: For doth not Predetermination to gracious acts, lay as much compulſion on the wil, and thence as much deſtroy its libertie, as predetermination to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin? And is not the ſame objection with its reaſons as much urged, and that with as great color of Reaſon, by the Moliniſts and Arminians, againſt al Predetermination to gracious acts? I muſt confeſſe, I could never, neither do I think any elſe can maintain and defend our ground againſt the Jeſuites and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians, if thoſe reaſons and grounds which our Adverſaries urge againſt Predetermination to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57509:91"/>
as valid. [2] The like may be ſaid of that other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection or reaſon, why our Adverſaries reject Predetermination to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin, namely, <hi>That it makes al Gods Laws naturally and abſolutely impoſſible,</hi> &amp;c. Is not this very objection, and the reaſon urged to enforce it, as much urged by Moliniſts and Arminians, againſt al Predetermination even to gracious Acts? And are not the reaſons as valid on the later as on the former ſide? What reaſon do the new Methodiſts give, that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination to the entitative act of ſin makes Gods Laws im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, but that it takes away the Wils Indifference, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the natural power that the wil is inveſted with to act or not to act? And doth not Predetermination to good as much deſtroy the wils indifference, and its power to act or not to act? [3] Our Adverſaries urge, <hi>That this Predetermination takes away the uſe of Promiſes, Invitations, and al evangelic offers of Grace, and ſuppoſeth God not to deal ſincerely with Sinners, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king offers of Grace, and yet irreſiſtibly determining their Wils againſt the acceptance of theſe offers?</hi> Is not this very objection, with its reaſon urged, and that with as much force of reaſon by Jeſuites and Arminians againſt Predetermination to gracious Acts? For if no man can entertain thoſe offers of Grace by his own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wil, without a predeterminative Concurſe, are not al gracious Promiſes, Invitations, and offers of Grace to Sinners, who fal not under this Predetermination, vain and uſeleſſe? Our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries the new Methodiſts generally, (ſome few excepted) denie any ſufficient Grace or Free-wil in corrupt Nature for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of evangelic offers and Grace: and is not then the viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wil of corrupt Nature as wel determined by its own vitioſitie againſt the offers of Grace, as by the predeterminative Concurſe of God? [4] Our Adverſaries object, <hi>That this Predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the entitative act of ſin, ſuppoſeth God to compel and force men to ſin, and ſo makes him to be the real Author of Sin, yea more than the Sinner that is under a violent compulſion,</hi> &amp;c. and is not this very argument urged by Jeſuites and Arminians againſt al Predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination even to what is good, and that with as much color of reaſon? For ſay they, If God predetermine the wil to what is good, then he compels and forceth the wil to be good; ſo that the wil being under a compulſion cannot be ſaid to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of its own act, but is as a Stock or Stone in the exercice of that act, which deſtroyeth al moral good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57509:92"/>
is as valid as that of our Adverſaries, and can never be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly anſwered if their objection be good; though according to our Principes neither the one or the other objection has any force in it, as we ſhal demonſtrate, <hi>c.</hi> 6. §. 5. To conclude this argument, I am very confident, our Opponents the new Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts wil never be able to defend an efficacious determinative Concurſe to what is morally or ſupernaturally good, ſo long as they denie the ſame to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin, which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good: for al, or at leaſt the moſt of thoſe arguments they urge againſt the later, may, and are urged by the Moliniſts and Arminians againſt the former, and that with equal force. And this <hi>Baronius</hi> did by his natural acumen foreſee, and therefore he took a courſe more ſeemingly rational according to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes, though leſſe friendly to divine Concurſe, to denie al Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination as wel to ſupernatural as natural good; of which ſee his <hi>Metaph.

                        <hi>its ſubſtrate mater and formal reaſon.</hi> 1. As to the general Idea and ſubſtrate mater of ſin, we have demonſtrated, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. §. 2. (1) <hi>That al human acts conſidered in their natural entitie, abſtracted</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Its mater.</note> 
                        <hi>from their moral conſtitution, are neither good nor evil.</hi> (2) <hi>That al moral acts whether good or evil receive their formal Conſtitution and Determination from the Moral Law.</hi> (3) <hi>That no human Act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered phyſically, or according to its natural entitative ſubſtance, is intrinſecally evil, but only morally, in regard of its moral ſpecification or determination to ſuch or ſuch an object.</hi> Hence, (4) <hi>That ſin has for its ſubſtrate mater ſome natural good.</hi> Now theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions being laid as ſo many Principes, we hence argue, <hi>That God muſt neceſſarily concur to, yea predetermine the ſubſtrate mater of actions intrinſecally evil:</hi> For, if al ſinful acts, even ſuch as are intrinſecally evil <hi>morally,</hi> are, according to their ſubſtrate mater <hi>phyſically</hi> good, doth it not neceſſarily follow, that God the firſt cauſe muſt concur thereto, yea predetermine the ſame? Muſt not every ſecond Cauſe as ſuch be actuated and ſo determined by its firſt Cauſe and his efficacious Concurſe? Doth not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of the ſecond Cauſe to the firſt, neceſſarily demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, not only its dependence on, but alſo Predetermination by the ſame in al its natural operations and effects? Is not every <hi>Being by participation</hi> neceſſarily limited, defined, and predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in al its natural entitative motions by the firſt Being, which
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57509:92"/>
is ſuch by Eſſence? May not this alſo be demonſtrated from the very conceſſions of our Adverſaries, who grant, that vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie follows not any Act as a natural Act? So <hi>Strangius, l. 2. c. 11. p. 243. We confeſſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that Vitioſitie doth not follow the</hi>

                        </note> 
                        <hi>act of ſin as an act; for then every act would be ſin; alſo that it doth not follow, as the act procedes from God, for then every act that procedes from God, would have ſin.</hi> Now if ſin follows not the act of ſin as an act, what reaſon can there be why God ſhould not efficaciouſly concur to, yea predetermine the entitative act of Sin? This is wel explicated by <hi>Lud. Crocius,</hi> (that <hi>Breme</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, who was a member of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the New Method) <hi>Duodecas, Diſſert. de Volunt.

But theſe things do wel agree, if the diſtinction be rightly obſerved, (1) Between the Act, and the Vitioſitie of the Act. (2) Between the Act as it is from God, and as it is from the Creature. (3) Between the wil of God decreeing, and the wil of God commanding.</q> Whence he concludes, <hi>Theſ. 100. p.</hi> 427. <q>For God wils and produceth, by the Creature as the firſt Cauſe by the ſecond, the Act, as an Act, of it ſelf indifferent to moral Bonitie, and Vitioſitie; and wils and effectes the ſame, albeit depraved by the Creature, as inveſted with his moral rectitude, becauſe he produceth it by his own power, from his immaculate Sanctitie and Juſtice, which can never be made crooked or corrupted by any ſecond Cauſe.</q> Whence he addes, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 101. <q>And this act eſſentially good, even as defiled by the Creature, God juſtly and holily uſeth either as an Inſtrument of puniſhment, or of explorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or exercice, and as an ordinate convenient Medium, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Juſtice for the beſt ends. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 102. In this ſenſe God is ſaid, <hi>To create evil, to produce it out of his mouth, to ſend</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph <hi>into</hi> Egypt <hi>by the Vendition of his Brethren, to rob</hi> Job <hi>of his goods, to command</hi> Shimei <hi>to curſe</hi> David, <hi>to uſe</hi> Abſolon <hi>for the defiling his Fathers Concubines, to deliver Chriſt into the hands of Jews and Gentiles.</hi> Theſ. 103. For God decreed to produce thoſe acts, as acts, and to permit the depravation of them by
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57509:93"/>
the Sinners, and to uſe them albeit depraved, wiſely and juſtly to ends holily ordained by him.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Divine Predetermination to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin may<note place="margin">2. From the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal reaſon of ſin.</note> be alſo demonſtrated from the <hi>formal nature</hi> of Sin, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtes in the privation of that moral rectitude due to actions, as <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. §. 2. we have more fully explicated. Whence we thus argue: If every deflexion from the Law of God be ſin, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God neceſſarily predetermines to the ſubſtrate mater of ſome ſins: and if of ſome, why not of al, even ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally evil? That God predetermines to the ſubſtrate mater of ſome ſins is evident, and that from the conceſſions of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, who grant, <hi>That God doth predetermine the Wil to actions imperfectly good, which alſo, according to their own confeſſions are modally ſinful:</hi> Whence we thus argue; The ſubſtrate mater of the ſame action as good and as ſinful is the ſame: wherefore, if God predetermine the wil to the ſubſtrate mater of the action as good, muſt he not alſo predetermine it to the ſubſtrate mater of the ſame action as ſinful? When we ſay, <hi>That God prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines to the ſubſtrate mater of the ſame action as ſinfil, As</hi> here, may not be taken <hi>reduplicatively,</hi> but only <hi>ſpecificatively,</hi> i. e. as it <hi>ſpecifies</hi> and <hi>diſtributes</hi> the ſame action into <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>ſinful;</hi> which are different modes of one and the ſame ſubſtrate mater or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titative act: ſo that our Opponents granting, that God doth predetermine the wil to the ſubſtrate mater of the action as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly good, how can they poſſibly denie, that God prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines it alſo to the ſame ſubſtrate mater which is modally ſinful? When I can ſee a rational ſolution given to this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (which I deſpair of) I ſhal think our Adverſaries have done much ſervice to their Cauſe. But they replie, <hi>If God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur by determinative influence to imperfectly good actions, it doth not thence follow, that he concurs to actions intrinſecally, and in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them evil.</hi> But I conceive this evaſion wil ſoon vaniſh into ſmoke and vapor, if we conſider wel, (1) That the leaſt ſin may not be imputed unto God as the Author of it, any more than the greateſt: the difference between ſins modally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally evil finds no place here: dare our Adverſaries ſay, that God is the Author of that modal ſin which adheres to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons imperfectly good, but not of that intrinſecal evil which is in the hatred of God, or the like? Whence, (2) The force of our Argument ariſeth from this paritie of reaſon, If God doth
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57509:93"/>
concur, yea predetermine the wil to an act only modally ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, without falling under the imputation of being the Author of ſin, why may he not alſo predetermine the wil to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate mater of that which is intrinſecally evil, without the like imputation? Albeit there be a diſparitie in the ſins, yet is not the paritie of reaſon for the one and the other the ſame? Ought we not to be as cautelous in exemting the Sacred Majeſtie of God from having any hand in the leaſt ſin, as in the greateſt? And if we allow our ſelves the libertie of making him the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the leaſt ſin, wil not that open a wide gate for atheiſtic blaſphemous wits to impute to him the greateſt ſins? Whence, if we can prove, what our Adverſaries wil never be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, yea what they approve of, namely, that God doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determine the wil to the ſubſtrate mater or entitative act, which is imperfectly good, but modally ſinful, it thence follows by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence and inevitable paritie of reaſon, that he can and doth predetermine the wil to the ſubſtrate mater of that which is intrinſecally evil, without the leaſt imputation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Author of ſin annexed thereto. I would fain have our Opponents weigh impartially the force of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>§. 6. Our next Argument for Gods Predetermination to the<note place="margin">6.

(2) <hi>Gods natural Permiſſion as Rector of the World is not of ſin ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as ſin, but as conducible to the principal ends of his divine Guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> It's true, Divine Permiſſion regardes not only the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate mater of ſin, but alſo ſin formally conſidered, and ſo ſin under that reduplication, <hi>as ſin,</hi> yet not ſimply conſidered, but as it has a tendence or conducibilitie to the advance of Divine Glorie: and ſo much is confeſſed by <hi>Strangius, l. 2. c. 22. p. 399. If the Reduplication be joined to the terme ſin, it's true, that ſin as ſin is permitted by God, phyſically not morally.</hi> Yet I adde, not <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but reſpectively,</hi> as conducible to Gods ſupreme ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.

unbelieving and diſobedient, both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Cananites,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Whereas he tels us, that the <hi>Mythologiſts ſay, Mars was the firſt that invented militarie weapons and affairs,</hi> &amp;c.

That which may adde to this parallelizing of <hi>Mars</hi> with <hi>Ioſhua</hi> is, that the <hi>Mythologiſts</hi> (whom <hi>Diodorus</hi> here brings in as the Authors of this deſcription) found abundant more matter and reaſon to reduce the ſtories they had received by Tradition touching <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> unto <hi>Mars,</hi> than thoſe of <hi>Nimrod.</hi> For the ſtories of <hi>Ioſhua</hi> were then, when <hi>Mythologie</hi> began to creep into the world, very <hi>freſh</hi> and <hi>pregnant,</hi> &amp;c. 4.

                        <hi>Hypotheſis is contradictory thereto, in that he cannot in Juſtice puniſh that Sin, which he predetermines men unto,</hi> we anſwer, (1) That Gods Predetermination lays no violent force or compulſion on the wil to ſin: he doth only as the firſt cauſe and God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſweetly though potently applie the wil to its act. (2) The wil doth in the very ſame moment, wherein it is predetermined by God, voluntarily and freely, as a deficient depraved facultie, elect the very act it is predetermined unto; ſo that it doth as freely, deliberately, and fully eſpouſe the act, as if there were no Predetermination on Gods part: and what more juſt than
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57509:105"/>
that the Sinner ſhould be ſeverely puniſhed for that ſinful act which he doth deliberately and voluntarily exert? (3) Here is in this objection a poor Sophiſme, which they cal <hi>No-cauſe for a cauſe:</hi> For Gods predeterminative Concurſe is not the cauſe of mens ſins, albeit mens ſins be a neceſſary conſequent thereof. (4) The ſame difficulties, which our Adverſaries urge us with in point of Divine Juſtice, return on them, who aſſert an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate previous Concurſe to the Mater of Sin; neither can they without apparent violence to their own Reaſon impute this objection to us, which their own Hypotheſis is as much obnoxious unto.</p>
                     <p>3. They urge us with an Imputation on the <hi>Clemence</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. From Gods Clemence and Mercie.</note> of God, in that predeterminative Concurſe to the entitative Act of Sin, makes the bleſſed God to be cruel towards his poor Creature; and this two ways: As (1) <hi>In that it makes God abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to predeſtine or reprobate men to eternal Puniſhment, without regard to their Sins. (2) In that it ſuppoſeth the bleſſed God to threaten and puniſh Sin with eternal Torments, and yet irreſiſtibly to predetermine yea impel men thereto,</hi> as <hi>Baron. Metaph.</hi> p. 151. This Objection our Adverſaries adorne and exaggerate with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpecious and plauſible pretextes for the Vindication of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Clemence and Mercy, as they pretend, and for our confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; Yet we no way dout but to make it appear, that al is but as emty vapor before the Meridian Sun. Therefore to anſwer, (1) to the firſt branch of the Objection, <hi>That our Hypotheſis makes God abſolutely to predeſtine or reprobate men to eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without regard to their ſins,</hi> [1] We grant, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Reprobation is, and muſt be according to our Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, <hi>abſolute,</hi> becauſe there is an adequate commenſuration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween abſolute Predefinition and Predetermination, as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries alſo maintain; of which before <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 3. [2] Yet we peremtorily denie, that God reprobates or predeſtines men to eternal puniſhment without any regard to their ſins. Divines ſay, that albeit ſin be not the motive or ground moving God to reprobate men, yet it is conſidered in the Decree of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as that for which God wil at laſt condemn men. It's true, the <hi>Supralapſarian Divines,</hi> who make man as <hi>labile</hi> the object of Reprobation, differ ſomewhat from thoſe of the <hi>ſublapſarian</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, who make the <hi>corrupt maſſe,</hi> or <hi>lapſed man</hi> the object of Election and Reprobation; yet they both take in the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57509:106"/>
of ſin in the Decree of Reprobation; and they both make the Decree of Reprobation in it ſelf abſolute: for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſarians make ſin only a commun condition of the corrupt Maſſe, not <hi>diſtinctive</hi> or <hi>diſcriminative</hi> of Reprobates from the Elect; as <hi>Davenant, Animadverſ. on Gods Love,</hi> p. 84. proves, <hi>That the Supralapſarians charge not Gods Reprobation with mans deſtruction;</hi> Though he himſelf goes the Sublapſarian way. But, [3] Here lies the bitter root of this forged Imputation affixed on us by our Adverſaries, that they conſider the Decree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation as an act of Divine Juſtice, which regards the object as already conſtituted, and not the conſtitution thereof. This is incomparably wel obſerved by judicious <hi>Davenant</hi> in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Hoard, Animadverſ.</hi> p. 229. <q>For thoſe Inferences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>That if abſolute Reprobation be granted, God may be properly called a Father of Crueltie,</hi>

That wherein he perpetually is miſtaken, is, the making of Non-election or Negative Reprobation a <hi>Vindicative act,</hi> the confounding it with the judicial Sentence of Damnation, the conceiving it to worke in the Non-elect an invincible neceſſitie of committing Sin, with ſuch like monſtrous fanſies, which he takes for Principles needing no proof, whereas they are ſuch groſſe errors as need no confutation.</q> (2) The ſecond part of the Objection, which ſuppoſeth <hi>the bleſſed God to threaten and puniſh Sin with eternal torments, and yet irreſiſtibly to predetermine and impel men thereunto,</hi> has been ſufficiently refuted in what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes, §. 1. and indeed throughout this whole Diſcourſe, and wil alſo come under conſideration in what follows.</p>
                     <p>4. Our Adverſaries charge alſo our Hypotheſis with a Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance<note place="margin">4. From Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sanctitis.</note> to the <hi>Sanctitie</hi> and <hi>Puritie</hi> of the Divine Nature, in that, by aſſerting <hi>Gods predeterminative Concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of Sin, we make the act of ſin to be wel-pleaſing to God.</hi> This objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is greatly aggravated by a Reverend Divine among our ſelves, who in the confutation of <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> argues thus: <hi>If God willeth that ſin exiſte by his Permiſſion, (1) He willeth Sin.</hi> Yea, (2) <hi>God wils ſin as much as man.</hi> Yea, (3) <hi>This makes God equally to wil Sin and Holineſs.</hi> Yea, (4) <hi>Then God takes complacence in Sin. Anſwer.</hi> Theſe are high charges indeed, and if they could be made good againſt us, we ſhould not deſerve protection from any wel-governed Kingdome or State: for what more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57509:106"/>
with civil Government, than to make the Supreme Rector and Governor of Mankind equally to wil Sin and Holineſſe? But theſe Calumnies and Reproches are not of yeſterday, but have been time out of mind imputed to the aſſertors of Efficacious Concurſe, and therefore we have been more large in the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, §. 1. of this Chapter. Thus <hi>Bradwardine, De Cauſ. l. 2. c.</hi> 28. p. 572. <q>When it is argued, ſaith he, <hi>that the ſinful act doth pleaſe God Wel,</hi> (1) The Adverbe <hi>Wel</hi> may determine the Verbe <hi>to pleaſe God,</hi> in regard of the Divine complacence, and ſo there is no dout, but that as the evil Act [entitatively conſidered] doth pleaſe him, ſo it is highly wel-pleaſing to him: or (2) in regard of the Act that is wel-pleaſing; and that either in regard of the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the act, or in regard of its <hi>vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie:</hi> [1] If we regard the act <hi>naturally,</hi> ſo it's true, that it is wel-pleaſing to God, but if we regard it <hi>morally,</hi> ſo it's falſe. [2] If we regard the <hi>vitioſitie</hi> of the act, ſo it is not properly effected by man, nor yet by God, it being not properly an effect, but pure Privation only.</q> An acute and excellent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of this Controverſie, were not the minds of men eaten out with Prejudices; the ſum whereof is this, The Act of ſin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titatively and ſubſtantially conſidered is naturally good, and ſo wel-pleaſing unto God, the Author of Nature; yet if we conſider it morally in regard of its Vitioſitie, ſo it is infinitely diſpleaſing to God. This is as a Key to open the dore to a more ful ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to al objections againſt us: ſo that at preſent we need ſay no more than this, that our Hypotheſis is no more obnoxious to theſe aſperſions, than that of our Adverſaries. Is not the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sanctitie as illuſtrious in Gods predetermining to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate mater of Sin, as if we held only with our Adverſaries an immediate previous concurſe thereto? Are not thoſe very Acts, which are morally evil as to the Sinner, both naturally and morally good as to God? Suppoſe he predetermine to the entitative act of ſin, yet muſt we thence neceſſarily conclude, that he predetermines men to ſin formally conſidered? Muſt not the ſinful qualities of al moral effects be imputed to the ſecond particular cauſe, and not to the firſt univerſal cauſe? It's true, the Sinner comes ſhort of the Divine Law, and therefore ſins, but doth God come ſhort of any Law? Has not his Wil the ſame Rectitude which his Nature is inveſted with, and therefore whatever he wils muſt be right and holy, even becauſe he wils it? The ſin which he governs,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57509:107"/>
is it not only ſin in regard of the Creatures wil, not in regard of his wil? It is confeſt, that God and the Sinner concur to the ſame ſinful act materially conſidered; but yet is their Concurſe the ſame? Yea is there not morally an infinite diſtance between the one and the other? Doth Sin as to Gods Concurſe, include any more than a natural act, which is in regard of God and the conducibilitie it has to his glorie morally good? but doth it not, as to mans Concurſe, ſpeake moral vitioſitie? Again, what doth Gods permiſſion of ſin implie, but a natural or judiciary Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Grace he is no way obliged to give? But doth not ſin as to the ſinner denote a moral privation or deficience of that rectitude which ought to be in his act? Is there any thing in the world purely, ſimply, and of it ſelf ſinful, without ſome ſubſtrate mater naturally good? What reaſon therefore can our Adverſaries allege, why God may not predetermine the wil to the ſaid ſubſtrate mater, without prejudice to his Sanctitie?</p>
                     <p>§. 3. We deſcend now to a third objection taken from the<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>1. As to Gods Laws and Prohibitions they urge, <hi>That our</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Hypotheſis renders them altogether uſeleſſe, yea naturally and ſimply impoſſible.</hi> This they exaggerate with many fine words and rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric flouriſhes, which are the beſt armes they have to defend their declining cauſe with. But having God and Truth, though naked and ſimple, on our ſide, we no way dout but to ſtand our ground againſt al their fiery, or venimous darts. And in anſwer to the firſt part of their Objection from the Impoſſibilitie of divine Precepts and Prohibitions, we anſwer, (1) That our Adverſaries greatly pleaſe themſelves in their falſe ſophiſtic Ideas and Notions of what is <hi>poſſible,</hi> or <hi>impoſſible;</hi> which we have endeavoured to clear from that ambiguitie and confuſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. §. 4. with endeavors to explicate what is poſſible and what impoſſible to corrupt Nature, as to divine Commands. (2) We are to know, that the Laws of God in their Second Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were primarily intended to ſubſerve the ends of the Goſpel
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57509:107"/>
as to the heirs of Salvation, to whom they are by Grace in an Evangelic way made poſſible. The Law is ſaid to be given in and by the hands of the Mediator, <hi>i. e.</hi> to ſubſerve his ends, which principally regard the Elect. (3) Yet we grant, that the Law is alſo of great uſe even unto Reprobates, [1] In that it lays a great reſtraint on them, not only as to wicked actions, but alſo as to luſts in ſome meaſure, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 24. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie and Majeſtie of Divine Precepts, backed with many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Curſes, leaves a great awe and reſtraint ſometimes on the moſt debaucht ſpirits, and ſo keeps their luſts from open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences. [2] The Precepts are ſo far uſeful to Reprobates, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they have no power to obſerve them, in that they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inſtructed, how much obedience is wel-pleaſing to God, and how ungrateful they are in not performing of it: whereby they are left without al Apologie or Excuſe. The Precept ſhews us what we ought to do, not what we can do: it is always <hi>impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> albeit not always <hi>operative:</hi> and may not the Soverain Lord require of man the payment of his debts, although by reaſon of his profligate bankrupt humor he hath diſabled himſelf from the payment of them? What excuſe is it for the Sinner to ſay, it is impoſſible for him to obey the Precept, whenas the impoſſibilitie lies in his own wil, not in any force or defect on Gods part? Doth he not in that very moment, wherein he is predetermined by God to the entitative act of Sin, voluntarily eſpouſe and wil that act? And doth not this leave him without al ſhadow of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe? Where can he loge the blame of his Sin but on his own crooked depraved wil, which electively and freely determines it ſelf to the Sin, in the ſame moment of time, though not of nature, that it is predetermined by God to the entitative act? (4) We affirme, that Gods certain Preſcience of Mens ſins, with the conditional Decree of Reprobation, Gods immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Concurſe to the entitative act of ſin, and mans univerſal impotence to perform what is ſpiritually good, which are al granted by our Adverſaries, bring ſinners under as great impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie of obeying Gods Commands, as abſolute Reprobation and predeterminative Concurſe to the mater of Sin aſſerted by us. This is wel demonſtrated by a judicious and awakened Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in his late Letter touching Gods Providence about ſinful Acts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 67. to 74. But becauſe he is a party, I ſhal mention only the Reſponſe of <hi>Davenant, Animadv.</hi> p. 341. <q>As
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57509:108"/>
for Gods Law, <hi>which cannot be kept without ſupernatural Grace,</hi> we ſay, that men are as capable of any ſupernatural Grace, conſidered under the abſolute Decrees maintained by S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> and by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as conſidered under the conditional Decrees of late framed by <hi>Arminius.</hi>
                        </q> And <hi>p.</hi> 418. he ſtrongly proves, <hi>That Divine eternal Preſcience of future Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Events infers as abſolute a neceſſitie of ſuch events and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of the contrary, as the Decrees of abſolute Predeſtination and Reprobation do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <note place="margin">2. From Gods Promiſſes and Invitations.</note> 
                        <hi>the Promiſſes and Invitations of God, which are made uſeleſſe and colluſive by our ſuppoſed divine Predetermination to the ſubſtrate mater of Sin,</hi> we anſwer,</p>
                     <p>(1) That al Gods Promiſſes and evangelic Invitations, which<note place="margin">(1) Al Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes primarily intended for the Elect.</note> are but branches of the Covenant of Grace, are primarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the elect Heirs of Salvation, to whom they are many ways uſeful, notwithſtanding Divine Predetermination: For the bleſſed God promiſeth life and happineſſe on the condition of Repentance and Believing, not as if there were any potence or abilitie in corrupt nature, by its own free-wil, to accept of theſe offers, or performe the Condition on which the offers depend, but thereby convincing the Soul of its extreme impotence, he doth together with the offer and invitation made conveigh Grace into the elect Soul, for the inabling of it to performe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: So that theſe general and conditional Promiſſes are in reference to the Elect, for whom they are primarily deſigned, <hi>operative</hi> of Grace, albeit as to others they are only <hi>exactive</hi> of dutie: whence the impoſſibilitie which attends corrupt Nature is taken off as to the Elect by Divine Grace.</p>
                     <p>(2) Neither are thoſe general evangelic Promiſſes and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations<note place="margin">(2) The uſe of evangelic Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates.</note> uſeleſſe as to Reprobates: for, [1] They declare the infallible and eſſential connexion which there is between the condition and the thing promiſed therein, namely, Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And to make this more clear, we are to remember, that both Logic and rectified Reaſon aſſures us, that a conditional enunciation doth not always note a poſſibilitie of the Antecedent, and Conſequent, but only their neceſſary connexion: that in al conditional Propoſitions, on which evangelic Exhortations and Invitations are founded, there cannot be ſuppoſed an indifferent and indeterminate poſſibilitie of the Antecedent and Conſequent,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57509:108"/>
but only the connexion of the Antecedent with the Conſequent, is evident from that of our Lord, <hi>John 15 6. If a man abide not in me he is caſt forth,</hi> &amp;c. Whence it is apparent, that a ſolid and ſerious Invitation unto Sinners may be built on a Condition in ſome mode impoſſible: The God of al grace has, by his evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic Conſtitution and Covenant, eſtabliſhed an inviolable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between Faith and Salvation, ſo that this Propoſition is infallibly true, <hi>If thou believeſt, thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> and the holy God has given his Miniſters Commiſſion to preach it to al Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, neither is there the leaſt colluſion or fraudulent intention on Gods part, albeit he doth predetermine the Moſt of men to the ſubſtrate mater of Unbelief: for the ſinceritie of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention appears in the realitie of the offer, which conſiſtes in the infallible connexion of the Conſequent with the Antecedent, grounded on the evangelic <hi>Pactum</hi> or Ordination, as <hi>Davenant</hi> wel obſerves, <hi>Animadverſ. on Gods Love,</hi> p. 377. where he ſhews, <q>That the Decree of God, permitting <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to abuſe the gifts of God to his own deſtruction, was not contrary unto the end or uſe whereunto thoſe gifts and actions of God had a fitting ordination in their own nature. So <hi>p.</hi> 387, 388. he demonſtrates, That Divine eternal Decrees, whereupon may infallibly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the abuſe of Grace temporally offered, do not croſſe the end for which ſuch Grace is adminiſtred to perſons not elected.</q> And he gives this reaſon for it, <hi>p.</hi> 352. <q>God meaning muſt be always interpreted according to the known nature of the Means, and not according to the unknown Wil of God concerning the infallible event or ſucceſſe of the Means. Gods meaning, when he offers any Grace unto men, is that they ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſuch actions whereunto ſuch grace conduceth: and his meaning when he promiſeth glory unto any man, <hi>if he believe and perſevere,</hi> is truely to performe it if he ſo do. But it is not always Gods abſolute wil to cauſe men to uſe his Grace to their own good.—If the Remonſtrants wil have nothing term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Gods meaning</hi> but his abſolute Wil, in their opinion as wel as in ours it wil follow, that God had no meaning to give <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> ſaving Grace or Glorie.</q> Laſtly, <hi>p.</hi> 392, 393, 394. he proves, <hi>That God doth by his wil of Approbation and Complacence unfeignedly wil what he commands and exhorts men to, albeit he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree the contrary event.</hi> Hence, [2] Theſe general Promiſſes and Invitations have this uſe alſo as to Reprobates, that it leaves
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57509:109"/>
them without the leaſt ſhadow of pretence or Excuſe for their unbelief: for if God doth by ſuch Promiſſes and Invitations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his real intention to ſave men if they believe, and withal an expectation that they accept his offers, yea, his complacence in ſuch an acceptation in order to life, with a proviſion of al means neceſſary thereto, what excuſe can men have for unbelief? Wil they ſay, that Gods predetermining men to the entitative act of unbelief contradicts ſuch a real intention? Take the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie of <hi>Davenant, Animadv.</hi> p. 271. <q>We anſwer, that God is no otherwiſe ſaid to intend outward events, than by providing orderly means for the producing ſuch events. Non-election provideth no means of making men ſin, and therefore it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth no intention of God to make men ſin, though it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a previſion of ſinful Events, and a Decree to permit them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        </note> to what is good, and Divine Preſcience of ſinful acts, doth as much diſpirit and deſtroy the uſe of Divine Promiſſes and Invitations as ours. For, [1] In that they aſſert none can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the condition required, and ſo embrace the evangelic offer made, without efficacious predeterminative grace, do they not leave al Reprobates under as great an impoſſibilitie of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving as we do? Are not al offers, for want of this predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative Grace, altogether uſeleſſe to them, for whom it never was intended? [2] So alſo as to Gods certain Preſcience of their Sins, did not God, according to their Conceſſions, certainly foreknow, that they would never, yea never could accept of the offers made to them, without predeterminative Grace, which he decreed never to give them? Hence doth not this certain Preſcience infer as natural and abſolute impoſſibilitie, as our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinative Concurſe to the entitative act of Sin? This is wel argued by <hi>Davenant, Animadv. p.</hi> 242. <q>His [<hi>Hoard</hi>'s] nibbling at the <hi>Synod of Dort,</hi> and charging them with mantaining <hi>a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Decree,</hi> is to little purpoſe. If he cal that <hi>fatal,</hi> which is certain and immutable, we are not afraid to affirm, that al Gods eternal Decrees are certain and immutable; and that very eternal Decree of Reprobation, which he imagines to follow upon the foreſight of mens final impenitence, is as abſolute and immutable, and in this ſenſe as fatal as that which we defend.</q> Thus alſo <hi>p.</hi> 332. <q>The Remonſtrants (we adde alſo the New

This is much ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Strangius, Baronius,</hi> and ſome of name among our ſelves. Anſwer, (1) In this I confeſſe the ſpirits and principal forces of<note place="margin">The injuſtice of the New Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts in urging this objection, and its incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence with their own ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> al their Objections centre, and that which the Defendents of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious concurſe have been in al Ages urged with by the Pelagians and Patrones of free wil. Thus <hi>Auguſtin</hi> was ever and anon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided by the Pelagians with a deſigne to introduce a <hi>fatal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie:</hi> the like the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> has been reproched with by the Arminians: and now, becauſe the name of <hi>Hobbes</hi> ſounds very harſh in Chriſtians ears, therefore that is faſtened on us. But this is no new method, but long ſince invented by the <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> for the oppreſſing of this ſuffering truth. (2) What the true Idea and notion of <hi>Libertie</hi> includes, and thence how little our Hypotheſis doth infringe the ſame, we have ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in the explication of the libertie of the wil, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. §. 3. (3) We anſwer with <hi>Bradwardine, lib. 3. cap. 29. pag.</hi> 739. that God violently impels no man to ſin, albeit he ſpontaneouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels or draws the wil voluntarily to the ſubſtance of that act which has ſin annexed to it; of which ſee what precedes <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. §. 2. (4) Our Adverſaries ſeem herein very unjuſt, in that they faſten their falſe Ideas of predeterminative concurſe and libertie on us, and ſo make us to hold what follows upon their ſentiments. For they placing the wils libertie in an actual indifference and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination; as alſo making al predeterminative concurſe to acte by violent impulſes on the wil, which being ſo impelled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no longer free, but is acted as a machine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it's no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if from ſuch falſe principes their forged conſequence and concluſion follows naturally. Thus <hi>Strangius, lib. 2. cap. 11. p.</hi> 243. makes Gods predetermination to the entitative act of ſin, to be an impulſion to ſin. The like is urged by one and another Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine of name among us, who wil allow no predetermination to the entitative act of ſin, but what is violent impulſion. It's true <hi>Bradwardine, lib. 9. cap. 29. pag.</hi> 739. uſeth the word <hi>impel</hi> for Gods predetermining concurſe, and the like <hi>Twiſſe;</hi> but then they limit it to ſuch a ſpontaneous voluntary impulſion, as is no way prejudicial to the wils libertie: But our Adverſaries make al pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinative concurſe, even in the ſupernatural acts of Grace, to be by violent impulſes, ſuch as leave the wil no more power to acte in a contrary way, than a mere Machine, which is impelled
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57509:111"/>
by a <hi>vis impreſſa, a force impreſſed</hi> from ſome extrinſec efficient: for thus they expreſſe themſelves, that to be predetermined even in the ſupernatural acts of Grace, <hi>is to be conſtantly managed as mere Machines that know not their own uſe.</hi> I muſt confeſs had we ſuch Ideas of predeterminative concurſe, it would neceſſarily follow, that the human wil is thereby diveſted of al its libertie; neither can I ſee how our Adverſaries wil be ever able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the Pelagians and Arminians on their principes, which ſuppoſe al predetermination to be a violent impulſion like that of <hi>Machines.</hi> I ever diſliked the Carteſian Hypotheſis, which makes the ſouls of Brutes to be but <hi>Machines;</hi> but to make the human ſoul and wil of man to be but a <hi>Machine</hi> in the reception of predeterminative grace or concurſe introduceth that <hi>fatal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie the darling of</hi> Hobbes, which is injuſtly fathered on us. We ſay, that predeterminative concurſe is as to its principe and mode of working the ſame as to natural and ſupernatural acts; neither doth it in the one or t'other at al infringe the libertie of the wil, but fortifie and confirme the ſame, in that it workes ſweetly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the indigence of the wil. And this I ſhal with much confidence aſſert, that we can with as much reaſon defend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation of human libertie with Divine predetermination of the wil to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin, as our Adverſaries the New Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts can defend the conciliation of human libertie with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine predetermination to the ſupernatural acts of Grace: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the termes produced be different, the one a ſupernatural, the other only natural good; yet predetermination as to its principe the Divine wil, as alſo as to its manner of working, which is agreable to the condition and libertie of the wil, admits no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. And this <hi>Baronius</hi> was ſufficiently apprehenſive of, and therefore denied al predetermination; and I no way dout but that in the iſſue our Adverſaries wil be forced to denie al predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or to grant us what we contend for as to the ſubſtrate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſin. Yea, (5) we ſhal yet aſcend a degree higher and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, <hi>That Gods certain preſcience of ſin,</hi> which our Adverſaries generally allow, infers as much a neceſſitie on the wil, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinative concurſe to the entitative act of ſin. This we have ſufficiently demonſtrated, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 2. and therefore ſhal here only ſuperadde an excellent demonſtration of judicious <hi>Davenant, Animadv. pag.</hi> 418, 419. <q>For the Divine eternal preſcience of future actions or events inferreth as abſolute a certaintie, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutabilitie,

neceſſitie of ſuch events, as the Decrees of abſolute Predeſtination and Reprobation do;</q> (we may adde, by a paritie of reaſon, predetermination which is adequate to abſolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees) <q>And therefore the Schole-men are as much troubled in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the Queſtion, <hi>Whether the Divine preſcience, or providence brings a neceſſitie to the things foreknowen?</hi> as in the other, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Divine predeſtination impoſeth a neceſſitie on things?</hi> And the Philoſophers, who never dreamed of Predeſtination or Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were yet much troubled to ſhew, how any thing could be <hi>fortuitous</hi> or <hi>contingent,</hi> admitting an eternal and infallible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of al future events in God—So that if this Author, or any other Remonſtrant, wil but take the pains to conſider, how the Schole-Divines clear the eternal and infallible preſcience, wil, and providence of God from impoſing fatal neceſſitie upon events foreſeen, willed, provided, he may with the ſame facilitie know how to clear the eternal abſolute Decrees of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reprobation from impoſing on mens actions any fatal irreſiſtible neceſſitie. As Gods abſolute preſcience doth not take away the poſſibilitie of the contrary action or event, no more doth his abſolute Decree.</q> Thus our judicious <hi>Davenant,</hi> in vindication of the abſolute Decree of Reprobation, which holds moſt true alſo of Divine predetermination as to the ſubſtrate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſin: for according to the confeſſion of our Adverſaries, <hi>Strangius</hi> and others, abſolute Reprobation neceſſarily infers Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine predetermination as to the entitative act of ſin.</p>
