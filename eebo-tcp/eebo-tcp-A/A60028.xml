            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALl Hiſtorians of the laſt Age, that make mention of the unfortunate Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> who is the ſubject of this Treatiſe, do alſo ſpeak of his Love for his Mother-in-Law; and as people are always apt to put an evil interpretation upon things of that nature, his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath done ſome wrong to the reputation of that vertuous Queen. The Authour of this Book having found in divers places the particularities of their
<pb facs="tcp:100068:5"/>
Hiſtory, thought himſelf obliged to communicate them to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, becauſe they juſtifie the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that Princeſs, and make it appear, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what was very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent on her ſide. Though ſhe had done nothing elſe, but diſcover the Conſpiracy, whereof you ſhall ſee the recital, ſhe had well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have ſome care taken of her glory, becauſe it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, that without her, the Prince of <hi>Navarre</hi> had never come to be the greateſt King in the world; and (to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to his honour) Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the Emperour <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth reſolved to quit the Government of the Empire, and to retire himſelf into a ſolitary way of living; fearing to leave his Son expoſed to the good fortune of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, of which himſelf had already felt the effects, he concluded with that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100068:7"/>
Prince a Truce for the five firſt years of his Son's Reign. Amongſt other Propoſitions for a Peace between the two Crowns, which were made du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Truce, was propoſed the Marriage of <hi>Don Carlos</hi> Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> and onely Son of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, and <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> his firſt Wife, with <hi>Madam Elizabeth</hi> the Eldeſt Daughter of <hi>France.</hi> This Princeſs was very young, but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully accompliſh'd for a perſon of her age: And as this Marriage was reſolv'd upon with great joy on both ſides, as ſoon as it was propoſed, ſhe could not chuſe but conceive a very great eſteem for him that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd to be her Husband; her young heart finding in that occaſion a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table object to fix it ſelf upon, did much pleaſe it ſelf in the thoughts of it; and ſhe did by degrees inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ingage her ſelf in an inclination, which, though altogether innocent, did afterwards prove more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100068:7"/>
bleſome to her vertue, then ever ſhe thought it would. The Prince of <hi>Spain</hi> was no leſs contented then ſhe with his hoped for happineſs; and as all that people ſaid to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Madam,</hi> gave him a very lovely Idea of her perſon, he aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd himſelf with pleaſure to all thoſe thoughts of love and deſire, which that Idea inſpir'd him withall. The Princeſs's Picture, which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome, was ſent him by the King of <hi>France,</hi> finiſhed that conqueſt in him, which the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her beauty had already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. Thoſe that brought it, ſaid, it was extremely like her; and <hi>Don Carlos</hi> eaſily believ'd them in a thing he ſo much deſired might be true. When he conſidered this Picture, there was no way that he would not willingly have tried, to let <hi>Madam</hi> know the thoughts he had of her. He could by no means endure that ſhe ſhould be ignorant of the joy,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100068:8"/>
which the hopes of poſſeſſing her fill'd him with. Sometimes he was even aſham'd of the exceſs of his good fortune, and could almoſt have been contented to allow himſelf the time of winning the Princeſs's heart by his merits and ſervices, rather then to obtain her by the common ways; but knowing that to be an impoſſible thing, he thought he ſhould be well enough ſatisfi'd, if he could but at leaſt acquaint her with the diverſity of his thoughts.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the face of affairs was wholly changed, by a ſudden and unexpected breach of the Five years Truce, the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> or thoſe that at the ſollicitation of <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth, brought about this rupture. The Pope's aim was, by raiſing troubles in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to free himſelf from the Duke <hi>D' Alva,</hi> who had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, and had for ſome time kept him, as it were,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100068:8"/>
block'd up within the Walls of <hi>Rome.</hi> One part of his deſign, which was the diverſion of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Arms, ſucceeded according to his deſire; but in <hi>Flanders</hi> he found more oppoſition, where the <hi>French</hi> loſt two Battels, in which the greateſt part of their moſt valiant men were either kill'd or taken priſoners; and, which reduc'd their affairs to ſo ill a a condition, that they reſolv'd ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to buy a Peace at what price ſoever. This Peace was the work of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> General of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, and of the Conſtable of <hi>Montmorency</hi> his Priſoner. The Conſtable repreſented to the Duke, That he could never hope to find a fairer occaſion of recovering the poſſeſſion of his Eſtates, from which his Father had been driven by <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt; and the Duke on his ſide prevailed ſo far with <hi>Philip</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that the Treaty was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a little while after, at <hi>Chateau-Cambreſis.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100068:9"/>
It is eaſie to judge of the grief of <hi>Don Carlos</hi> at the breaking of the Truce, and how great his joy was when the Negotiation of a Peace was reaſſumed; and yet this Peace, which ſeemingly gave ſuch ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grounds for his hopes, was that which at laſt proved their utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>During the time of the Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Philip</hi> the Second was made a Widower, by the death of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> his Second Wife; and being obliged by ſeveral weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiderations to a Third Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he demanded for himſelf the Princeſs, that had before been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to his Son. The <hi>French</hi> would doubtleſs much rather have given her to the Heir of the Crown, who was much of the ſame age with her, then to a Prince old enough to have been her Father, and by whom ſhe could have none but younger Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and by conſequence incapable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100068:9"/>
of inheriting the Crown: but, all things conſidered, he could not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely be refuſed. Though this news was like the ſtroak of a Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolt to poor <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> who was told it at firſt before a great deal of company, yet he was enough Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of himſelf, to hinder any body from taking notice of the grief it cauſed in him; but the violence he did himſelf, coſt him dear, when he was alone. All his thoughts were nothing, but the continual inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Love and Rage. But the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he was in not permitting him to reſolve upon, nor the preſent ſtate of his fortune to undertake any thing that might eaſe his mind, his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair was inſenſibly turned into Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly; and from thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded that reſerved way of living, which rendred him ſo odious to the King his Father, who never once dreaming of the true cauſe of his diſcontent, and judging of his Son
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100068:10"/>
by himſelf, did attribute it to the impatience he thought this young Prince might have of Reigning.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Madam,</hi> though what ſhe felt in her ſelf for <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> was rather a diſpoſition to love him, then a true and well eſtabliſhed paſſion, yet the fear ſhe had that there was ſomething more in it then as yet ſhe apprehended, made her have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable diſtruſt of her ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Till then ſhe had an extreme curioſity to know the effect her Picture had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced upon the Prince; nay, and ſhe had deſired ſometimes, that his heart, if it were poſſible, might in that reſpect enjoy leſs quiet then her own: But as ſoon as ſhe knew the change that was happened in their fortune, ſhe feared nothing in the world ſo much as to be lov'd by him.

of thoughts, her mind not having all the tranquillity neceſſary to bring her handſomely off, in an Action ſo hard for a perſon in her circumſtances, as her firſt arrival at the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> was, ſhe ſtopp'd her journey as long as ſhe could have the leaſt appearance of an excuſe; and though the Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi> had marri'd her in his Maſters name, in the moneth of <hi>June,</hi> ſhe did not leave <hi>Paris</hi> till the end of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> She ſtaid to ſee all the fine Houſes that were in her way, and did not come into the Province of <hi>Aquitane,</hi> till the year was ready to expire, as if thoſe delays could have done that in her heart, that her own reaſon was not capable of doing.

arms, and could not be brought to her ſelf, till <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was ready to ask leave to ſalute her. After the firſt civilities, theſe two illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, taken up with the mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of each other, left off ſpeaking, and the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany holding their peace out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, there was for ſome time a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence extraordinary enough in ſuch an occaſion. <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was not ſhap'd according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt rules of Symmetry; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the excellency of his comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, and one of the fineſt heads in the world, his eyes were ſo full of fire and life, and his Mien was ſo ſofty and martial, that he could not with reaſon be thought any ways unpleaſing. At firſt, the wonderful beauty of the Queen did even dazle his eyes; but the conſideration of what he had loſt in loſing her, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed his admiration into ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100068:13"/>
and fore-ſeeing what he was like to ſuffer for her, he came by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to look upon her with ſome kind of fear. In the mean time the Duke <hi>De l' Infantado</hi> thought, that the Queen ſtaid out of civility, to know when it was <hi>Don Carlos</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to go, and that the Prince out of reſpect ſtaid for the ſame reaſon. This made him put the Queen in mind, that it was time to be going; and by that means he drew them both out of a greater perplexity then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he was aware of. The Prince having taken his place in the Queens Coach, never lifted his eyes from off her all the way; and he had all the conveniency he could deſire to conſider her, and undo himſelf. The Queen ſoon obſerved it; and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Sentiment, of which ſhe was not the Miſtris, made her find ſome kind of ſweetneſs in ſeeing the diſorder <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was in. Yet ſhe durſt not at firſt ſeem to obſerve him too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100068:13"/>
and he could not look upon her without trembling: But at laſt their eyes, after having avoided one another's rencounter for ſome time, not able to do themſelves any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther violence, and meeting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by chance, had not the force to withdraw themſelves from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of ſo tempting objects. It was by theſe faithful Interpreters, that <hi>Don Carlos</hi> told the Queen all he had to ſay to her. He prepared her by a thouſand ſad and paſſionate looks to ſuffer all the obſtinacy and greatneſs of his paſſion. The heatt of this Prince, burden'd by its own ſecret, and preſs'd with the grief of its misfortune, could no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to eaſe it ſelf; and the opinions he conceived by the troubled and diſcompoſed carriage of the Queen, that ſhe was not ignorant of his meaning, gave him ſo ſenſible a joy, that it made him forget, for ſome moments, both the good Fortune
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100068:14"/>
of his Father, and his own unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This little ſatisfaction gave him a liberty of mind at the firſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the King and Queen, which otherwiſe he could not have hoped for; but the Princeſs was ſo intent upon her melancholly thoughts, that the preſence of her Husband could not draw her out of them. When they were arrived at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and that the King had received her at her coming out of the Coach; after the firſt Ceremonies practiſed in thoſe occaſions, ſhe ſet her ſelf to look fixedly upon him, without thinking on what ſhe did, as if ſhe had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved whether or no he took notice of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhe was in. <note n="*" place="margin">

for an ill omen by thoſe that ſtood by, and ſome judged from that very time that the union between two perſons ſo different in that, as well as upon ſeveral other accounts, could never be happy.</p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>Spain</hi> that had hearkened to the wonders that were commonly reported of the Queens Beauty, as to the ordinary exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given to the good qualities of Princeſſes, was infinitely aſtoniſhed when it ſaw that all that had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of her came ſhort of the truth.</p>
            <p>This Princeſs was born into the World with all the advantages Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could beſtow upon her, and ſhe was then in that flouriſhing Age which is requiſite to make a perfect Beauty. All beautiful perſons do not touch all ſorts of hearts; but the Queen was equally adored by the People, and in the Court. As of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as ſhe ſhewed her ſelf in publick,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100068:15"/>
ſo often ſhe triumphed over the hearts of all thoſe that ſaw her. It was ſo hard to ſee her without lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her, that it is to this day a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Brantome,</hi> in her Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</note>
               <hi>That no wiſe man would venture to look her long in the Face.</hi> In fine, if it be true, that beauty is a kind of Natural Royalty, one may ſay, That never Queen was more properly Queen then ſhe: It had been hard that her happy husband, poſſeſſor of ſo many perfections, ſhould not have been charmed by them. The ſmalleſt actions and geſtures of this Princeſs appeared to him extreamly taking. He found alwayes in her an attracting ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, equally different from the coy ſeverity of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Women in Publick, and the too extravagant Sallies of their paſſion when in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. Sometimes in making reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon theſe things, he admired his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100068:15"/>
own happineſs, but it was only in himſelf; for he did not think it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his Grandeur to let ſo young a perſon know the weakneſs ſhe was the cauſe of in him. And if ſhe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected any thing of it, ſhe had quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt that thought, by conſidering the little truſt he ſeemed to put in her, his ſevere carriage towards her, and his regularity to ſhut all his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes within the bounds of the night, as if he had been afraid leſt ſhe ſhould have ſeen him in ſome poſture leſs grave then that in which he was uſually ſeen by other People. This way of proceeding, ſo little obliging in appearance, and ſo differing from that agreeable unrulineſs of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that ordinarily accompanies the happy condition of ſatisfied Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, did in no wiſe anſwer the <hi>Idea</hi> the Queen had form'd of the life that two Married People, happy enough to love one another, ought to lead. So that ſhe lookt upon her
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100068:16"/>
Husband as a Man of whom ſhe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed nothing but the Body, and whoſe mind was wholly filled with Politick thoughts and ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. In the mean time, ſhe was ſo extreamly loved by him, that the enjoyment of her, far from dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing his paſſion, did but augment it: whether it were that the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the object loved, which ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies ſo fully the deſires of moſt Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, ſerved only to increaſe his, by diſcovering to him every day new hidden beauties, or that the ſecret he made to her of his love redoubled it's violence.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Don <hi>Carlos</hi> was marvellouſly unquiet to know what thoughts the Queen had of him. And though every time ſhe lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he thought he diſcovered in her eyes a ſecret and paſſionate lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, which appeared not there at other times, yet he durſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve even what he ſaw: whatſoever
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100068:16"/>
impatience he had, to have a clearer knowledge in this point, ſhe being but very ſeldome alone, during the publick divertiſements that were made in honour of her Wedding, he was a great while without being able to entertain her in private: but at laſt, fortune, which pleaſeth her ſelf, in furthering thoſe deſignes, that can have no other then unhappy events, offer'd him an occaſion of ſo doing, when he the leaſt expected it. The King being come into <hi>Spain</hi> but a little while before the Queen, had not as yet paid the laſt honors due to the Body of the Emperor, who then lay in State ſome dayes journeys from <hi>Madrid,</hi> in the Monaſtery of the <hi>Hieronimites,</hi> where He had end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his dayes. The Queen was well pleaſed to accompany her Husband in this Voyage, to ſee a Countrey that was reported to be the moſt beautiful part in all <hi>Spain.</hi> The Convent of the <hi>Hieronimites</hi> of St.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100068:17"/>
               <hi>Juſtus</hi> is ſcituate in a Valley at the entrance of <hi>Extramadura,</hi> which ſtretcheth it ſelf along the Banks of the River <hi>Guadiana,</hi> from the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Caſtilia</hi> to that of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Valley is encompaſſed with hills of an extraordinary height, the leaſt fruitful places of which are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with thoſe eternally-green Trees, which are not to be found but in thoſe hot Countreys. A thouſand little Brooks, that have their Springs among theſe Woods, after many curious turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings caſt themſelves into the River that croſſes the Plain; and the Soile that is made fertile by this great quantity of running water, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes brought forth an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Orange</hi>-Trees, <hi>Lemmon</hi>-Trees, and other ſuch like plants that grow under this happy Climate. Theſe Brookes in the hotteſt dayes of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer do maintain in the ſhady walkes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100068:17"/>
of this Deſart, a cooleneſs, which by all the Artifice of Man cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in another place, and the Greens which alwayes grow upon their Bankes have ſo lively a luſtre, that the pencil of the skilfulleſt Painter could never compoſe one ſo beautiful. The Court being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto this ſolitude, which <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had rendred ſo famous by his retreat, the King after having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the firſt duties of Piety, would needs ſee a young Religious Man that his Father had much loved; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things he was curious to know the original of this Friendſhip: he was told, That the Emperor go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one morning, when it came to his turn, to wake the other Religious, found this young Man, who was then a Novice, buried in ſo profound a ſleep, that he had much adoe to make him riſe; that the Novice at laſt getting up with much diſcontent, and at beſt not above half awake,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100068:18"/>
could not keep himſelf from ſaying to him, <hi>That he might well enough be contented to have troubled the quiet of the World, ſo long as he had lived in it, without coming to diſturb the repoſe of thoſe that had forſaken it;</hi> and that this anſwer had ſo taken the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that he had teſtified a particular inclination to him ever after. After ſome other diſcourſes, all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſeparated themſelves to take a Walk in this agreeable Wilderneſs, ſo that the Queen, who was wearyed with the journey, was left almoſt alone with Don <hi>Carlos.</hi> And as thoſe that ſtayed with them were not of a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to intereſt themſelves in their converſation; Don <hi>Carlos</hi> raviſhed to find ſuch an opportunity, propoſed to her to go and reſt her ſelf in a little Wood of <hi>Orange</hi>-trees that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Apartment of the Emperor; thither they went, and the Prince who was afraid of being interrupted, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently began the diſcourſe with a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100068:18"/>
made the Queen loſe the ſuſpicion ſhe had of his deſign. At firſt he conjured her not to diſquiet her ſelf for the things he had to ſay to her, and to believe, that he would never give her any other trouble then that of hearing him. Afterwards he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched her to remember the time, when they were deſtined for each other, and to conſider what impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo charming a hope muſt needs have made upon his heart. <hi>You may eaſily believe, Madam</hi> (continued he) <hi>that the ſight of you, hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced this impreſsion; and I feel but too well, that it will never be defaced in me.</hi> The Queen at firſt could not keep her ſelf from taking pleaſure to ſee a man have ſo paſſionate ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for her, and ſuch as no body ever yet durſt teſtifie to her. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards making reflection on the words of Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> ſhe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended ſo well their force, and they gave her ſo ſad an Idea of the ſtate
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100068:19"/>
of that Prince's mind, that they made her conceive a great deal of pitty for him. She confeſſed to him, <hi>That the eſteem ſhe had heretofore had for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, at the time ſhe was deſigned to be his Wife, did not permit her to ſee his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering without grief, nor to deny him thoſe conſolations which ſhe could give him without offending her duty.</hi> The Prince anſwered her, <hi>That he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to no other conſolation, then that of ſeeing her, and ſpeaking to her:</hi> But the Queen, who perhaps was afraid of ſaying more then ſhe had a mind to, roſe up at theſe words, and walking towards the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Rui Gomez,</hi> whom ſhe ſaw coming towards her, ſhe onely told Don <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los, That if he were wiſe, and lov'd her truly, far from ſeeking her company, he would do what he could to avoid it.</hi> Don <hi>Carlos</hi> was extreamly ſatisfied with the Declaration he had made to her of his paſſion, and his carriage afterward was as free, as before it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100068:19"/>
ſeem'd to be conſtrain'd. The Qneen was one of the firſt that took notice of this change: and, as there is no forme under which love may not be diſguiſed to inſinuate it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a heart, no not ſo much as that of reaſon and vertue it ſelf, ſhe thought her ſelf obliged both out of prudence and generoſity, to keep ſecret the paſſion of this Prince. In this thought ſhe could not hinder her ſelf from letting him know, that ſhe lookt upon the change of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour as an effect of his diſcretion. Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> the firſt time he could find an opportunity of ſpeaking to her in private, after the return of the Court to <hi>Madrid,</hi> took the liberty to put her in mind of it; and he aſſured her, with a great deal of pleaſure, that there was no ſort of humor, nor manner of life ſo contrary to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination, but his paſſion could make him undertake for her ſake. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, they made one another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100068:20"/>
of as many particularities of their lives as were fit to be related. Don <hi>Carlos</hi> told the Queen all that had paſſed in his heart and mind, ever ſince the firſt time he had heard her ſpoken of. And ſhe (when he had done ſpeaking) made him the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her Infancy, with a thouſand little circumſtances, which employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as agreeably his intention, as they would have ſeemed tedious to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different perſon. Onely when ſhe came to that part of her Diſcourſe that touch'd the reſolution of their Marriage, ſhe did not enlarge her ſelf upon the Sentiments ſhe had had on that occaſion, with ſo much liberty as the Prince had done upon his; but the violence he ſaw ſhe did her ſelf to hide them; told him more then ſhe concealed. In ſuch pleaſing Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments it was that theſe two illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Perſons ſpent the time they could have to be together; when fortune, already weary of favouring ſo
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100068:20"/>
innocent a commerce, ingaged Don <hi>Carlos</hi> in an adventure, that was the foundation of all his misfortunes.</p>
            <p>Of all the Ladies, in whom the Queens beauty cauſed envy and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, there was none that had greater reaſon to hate her upon that account, then the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli;</hi> in wit and beauty ſhe ſurpaſſed all the Court, and for this reaſon, as well as becauſe of the great favour her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was in with the King, ſhe held the firſt ranke among the Ladies. She had an equal Love for magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and pleaſure, and, as ſhe thought, nothing capable of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the charmes of her perſon and wit, ſhe had at firſt form'd a deſign upon the Kings heart: but the Queens beauty having rendred her project fruitleſs, ſhe attempted to make Don <hi>Carlos</hi> in Love with her, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find in the heart of the Son, the ſame obſtacle that had hindred her ſucceſs with the Father. <hi>Rui Gomez,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100068:21"/>
in quality of the Prince's Governour, was lodged in the ſame Apartment with him; the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli</hi> his Wife, beſides the conveniency of ſeeing Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> had often occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of obliging him, in reconciling him with her husband, with whom he had ſome little Quarrels every day. Don <hi>Carlos</hi> who was very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, and who ſaw with what zeal ſhe employed her ſelf for him, was not wanting in gratitude to her for it, and lived very civilly with her.</p>
            <p>Theſe favourable diſpoſitions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Princeſs good hopes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her enterprize, ſhe quickly found out the meanes to bring him to the point ſhe deſired. The admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had for the Queen, cauſed in him a certain contempt of all other Women. Beſides, it is well known, that moſt young people of that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity love naturally to divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the coſt of others, and the flattery of thoſe that praiſe them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100068:21"/>
them to thoſe ſorts of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging Jeſts, in ſtead of reproving them for it. Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> who was not exempt from all the faults of his Age and quality, and the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> yet younger, and more hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed then he, having one day played one of their ordinary tricks to ſome women of the firſt Quality, who complained of them, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Eboli</hi> had much ado to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Rui Gomez</hi> not to ſpeak of it to the King. That very night this Woman being alone in her Cloſet with Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> ſhe began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him with the little conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had for the Ladies, and after having made him a thouſand Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon that Subject; ſhe conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the friendſhip ſhe had for him muſt needs be very ſtrong, to make her pardon thoſe kind of things. The Prince who perceiv'd not her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and who was oblig'd in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to profeſs much affection to her,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100068:22"/>
anſwered her, laughing; <hi>That ſhe had more reaſon to employ her ſelf for him, then perhaps ſhe thought; becauſe, the little conſideration he had for all other Women, came from the Monopoly ſhe had made of all the eſteem he was capable of for that Sex.</hi> The Princeſs charmed with thoſe words, which ſhe took for a declaration of Love, anſwer'd him in a manner that opened his eyes, and made him perceive his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; At firſt he was of the mind to make uſe of it, and, it ſeemed to him, that never Infidelity was more excuſable then that he was going to commit.</p>
            <p>This Princeſs was of thoſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who, without having all their Features exactly proportion'd, have ſomething that touches more then the moſt regular Beauties. But, how dangerous ſoever ſhe were, Don <hi>Carlos</hi> was yet full of the paſſion he had for the Queen, his imagination repreſented her to him at that inſtant,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100068:22"/>
with thoſe graces and that ſweetneſs, that made all other Beauties appear rude and inſipid in compariſon of hers; and, the force of this Idea made him all on a ſudden look upon the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with a diſdain, which ſhe had no reaſon to expect from him. Yet he anſwer'd her Compliment in the moſt obliging manner he could, without ſatisfying her deſire: but, ſhe ſaw well enough that he pretended an affection which really he had not. A Woman, that hath ſeen her ſelf in this condition, never forgets it, and remembers it with rage, if ſhe hath not cauſe to remember it with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. We ſhall ſee the effects this rage produced in the heart of the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli;</hi> in the mean time, Love, that had pitty of her Adventure, brought a new Perſonage upon the Stage of this Court, to repair the fault of Don <hi>Carlos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Son of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100068:23"/>
the King took about that time out of the hands of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nobleman, who had brought him up as his own Son; and, though this young Prince had alwayes thought himſelf to be ſo, he was as fierce and as ambitious as if he had known his true birth. When this <hi>Spaniard</hi> who paſſed for his Father, came to caſt himſelf at his feet, before he preſented him to the King, Don <hi>John</hi> lookt upon him in that poſture with as much tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as if he had a long while ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected this change. Seeing nothing in the New Rank he was entred into above his courage, he was not at all dazled with it, and all the Court ſaw with admiration the Son of Don <hi>Lewis Quiſciada</hi> accuſtome himſelf in leſs than half an hours time to act the Son of an Emperor.</p>
            <p>This new Prince not being of an humor to make uſe of all precautions neceſſary to defend his heart againſt the charmes of the Queen, fell in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100068:23"/>
Love with her as ſoon as he ſaw her. And whether it were that his paſſion flatter'd his vanity, or that he hoped to make it ſerve to the eſtabliſhment of his fortune, when he perceived it, he made no attempt to cure himſelf of it; and as he was naturally a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler, it was eaſie for him to hide the aſſiduity he manifeſted about the Queens Perſon, under the pretext of the neceſſi y of his appearance at Court. His overcarefulneſs ſoon diſpleaſed Don <hi>Carlos;</hi> and though this Princeſs would have perſwaded him that ſhe was glad of that obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to hinder the freedom of their converſation, that ſo ſhe might be leſs expoſed to ſuffer the expreſſions of his Love, yet ſhe conceived an averſion for Don <hi>John,</hi> of which ſhe would not examine the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>There is no rencounter in the life of Man where diſſimulation is of ſo great uſe, as in love, nor any in which it is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100068:24"/>
harder to diſſemble. The Prince could not alwayes be ſo abſolutely Maſter of his paſſion, when the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Don <hi>John</hi> was troubleſome to him, as that this latter did not at length perceive ſomething thereof; And as there is nothing ſo penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as the eyes of a Rival, he had quickly deceived the reaſon of it. This knowledge gave him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame curioſity, to know, whether the Prince's Paſſion were known to the perſon that cauſed it, and whether ſhe anſwered it or no. To be the better inform'd of this, he reſolved to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit being in Love with a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman that waited upon the Queen, who was handſome enough to render this counterfeit probable, and who appeared to be more in her favour then any of her other women. He ſpared nothing of all he could imploy to corrupt her; but it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he could draw from her the ſecret of her Miſtreſs, becauſe ſhe knew it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100068:24"/>
not; for, the Queen, far from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting any body elſe with it, would have been glad, if ſhe could, to have hid it from her ſelf. He took pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of talking to this Lady, that ſo he might leave Don <hi>Carlos</hi> alone with the Queen, and he became inſenſibly as commode as till then he had been troubleſome. He thought, that if they were of intelligence with each other, he ſhould know nothing of it, by intereſting himſelf in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, becauſe they would then take heed of him, and that his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity would but make them hate him the worſe, and keep him the more out of their privacy, into which he deſired paſſionately to be admitted. The Queen appeared ſo reſerved, that he deſpaired of entring into hers: He attempted then to get that of the Prince, whoſe free and ingenuous nature promiſed him a greater facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; in this deſign he changed wholly his carriage towards him; He uſed no
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100068:25"/>
more that familiarity which the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of an Uncle gave him, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the moſt reſpectful of his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers. He managed ſo dextrouſly the occaſions of making People take notice of Don <hi>Carlos</hi>'s good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that this Prince, who ſuſpected not his eſteem of flattery, becauſe he knew that he deſerv'd it, came by degrees to think that his Uncle loved him. Don <hi>Carlos</hi> did in the end, even put a great deal of confidence in him, but as that of a truly generous Man, and who loves really, never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf to the ſecret of his love when he is well uſed: The Prince at length intruſted all things to his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles knowledge, beſides that one he deſired to know.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>John</hi> growing deſperate, with not being able to diſcover any thing, reſolved to take Counſel of ſome body that had more experience than himſelf in thoſe matters. As he was the handſomeſt and beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100068:25"/>
Prince in Europe, he had at firſt mightily pleaſed the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli,</hi> who knew not that the Queen was to be fatal to all her deſignes; Yet, ſhe did not wholly ſpoile this laſt, as ſhe had done the others. Don <hi>John</hi> was one of thoſe happy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, that are never ſenſible to beauty, but in view of the pleaſures it can give; and that of the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli</hi> promiſing much, touched at leaſt his ſenſes, if it did not reach his heart, as the Queens had done. On the other ſide, he conſider'd the Princeſs as a perſon whoſe Counſels might ſerve him very conſiderably, in a Court, where all things were new to him. He prevented by his officiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the teſtimonies of good will which ſhe ſought to give him; and appeared ſo tranſported with joy at the firſt Marks he ſaw of it in her, that ſhe well judged he would anſwer to greater with much ardour. So that they had ſoon eſtabliſhed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100068:26"/>
by ſo much the more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as their hearts were not enough concerned in it to trouble their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures by jealouſies, and thoſe other too delicate ſcrupuloſities, that great paſſions uſe to inſpire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don John</hi> living in this manner with the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli,</hi> reſolved fully to acquaint her with all he knew concerning the love of <hi>Don Carlos.</hi> It is eaſie to judge of the joy ſhe had at the hearing of this news: ſhe was ſo taken up with it, that ſhe made no reflection upon the intereſt <hi>Don John</hi> took in the Queens heart: Onely ſhe counſelled him, continually to obſerve all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe how circumſpect ſoever one be, it is impoſſible not to forget one's ſelf ſometimes, when one is truly in love. And as ſhe examined not the intereſt he ſeem'd to take in this matter, ſo he was not too curious in ſearching out the reaſon of that zeal, with which ſhe promiſed him
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100068:26"/>
to employ her ſelf in it. He thought, without deeper examination, that it was an effect of the complaiſance ſhe had for him, and of the curioſity or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to thoſe of her ſex. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that two ſo clear-ſighted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would ſoon have diſcovered, what they had ſo much intereſt to know, if it had not been for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which broke all their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, in abſenting <hi>Don Carlos</hi> from the Court, and which cannot well be underſtood, without following the Story to its firſt ſource.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> de Thou, Aubigné Etr.</note> Among the reports that had run about in the world concerning the Emperour's retirement; the moſt ſtrange of all was, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual negotiations he had had with the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany,</hi> had bred in him ſome inclinations for their opinions, and that he had hid himſelf in that ſolitude, onely to have the greater liberty of ending his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100068:27"/>
days in thoſe exerciſes of piety, that were moſt conformable to his ſecret diſpoſition. It was ſaid, he could not pardon himſelf the ill treatment he had made to thoſe brave Princes of that party, that the chance of War had brought into his power. Their vertue, which in the midſt of their misfortune ſhamed his proſperity, had bred in him by degrees ſome ſort of eſteem for their opinions. He durſt not any longer condemn a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to which ſo many great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons made it their glory, to ſacrifice all that men can have moſt precious in the world. This eſteem appeared by the choice he made of perſons, ſtrongly ſuſpected of Hereſie, for his Spiritual conduct, as of the Doctor <hi>Cacalla</hi> his ordinary Preacher; of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and above all, of <hi>Conſtantine Pontius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Droſſa,</hi> and the Director of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. It hath been known ſince, that the Cell where he died at St.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100068:27"/>
               <hi>Juſtus,</hi> was filled on all ſides with little Papers, written with his own hand, concerning Juſtification and Free Grace, which was not very far from the Doctrine of the Innovators. But nothing confirmed this opinion ſo much as his Will, there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt no pious Legacies in it, nor any foundations for Prayers for his Soul; and it was made in a manner ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe of all zealous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, that the Inquiſition of <hi>Spain</hi> thought it had right to take notice of it, yet it durſt not make any noiſe before the King's arrival. But this Prince having ſignalized his entry into that Countrey, by the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary puniſhment of all that were adherents to the new opinion; the Inquiſition growing bolder by his example, attacked firſt the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> afterwards the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's ordinary Preacher, and laſt of all <hi>Conſtantine Pontius.</hi> The King having ſuffered them to be impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100068:28"/>
all three, the people look'd upon his patience as a Maſter-piece of his zeal for the true Religion; but all the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> ſaw with horrour the Confeſſor of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> (in whoſe arms that Prince expired, and who had, as it were, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into his boſome his great Soul) delivered to the moſt cruel and moſt ſhameful of all puniſhments, and that too by the hands of the King his Son. In effect, the Inquiſition thinking fit in the proſecution of their Proceſs, to accuſe theſe three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of having an hand in making the Emperour's Will, had the boldneſs to condemn them to be burnt with the Will. The King awaken'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at this Sentence as at a clap of Thunder: At firſt the jealouſie he had of his Father's glory, made him find ſome pleaſure in ſeeing his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory expoſed to this affront; but afterwards having conſidered the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of this attempt, he hinder'd its effect by the moſt gentle and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100068:28"/>
ways he could chooſe, thereby to ſave the honour of the holy Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and make no breach upon the Authority of that Tribunal. As for <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> at the firſt news he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of this buſineſs, he talk'd of it onely as a matter fit for raillery; but ſeeing that the Inquiſition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in good earneſt its purſuit, he conceived an indignation proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to what he owed to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Emperour. To comprehend the reaſon of the particular intereſt he took in that buſineſs, we muſt know, that this great Perſonage, who, amongſt other heroick qualities, did ſovereignly poſſeſs that of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding himſelf in men, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived extraordinary hopes of his Grandſon. When he retired himſelf into <hi>Spain,</hi> he would needs have him along with him: And it was in that excellent School of Wiſdom and Magnanimity, that <hi>Don Carlos</hi> had confirmed himſelf in his natuaal
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100068:29"/>
love for glory, and for all Princely vertues. The deſire he had to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer worthily the pains of ſo illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Preceptor, had in ſome ſort ripen'd his Wit before the time, and made it bring forth fruits, that were not to be hoped for in ſo early a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Emperour knew how to manage the fiery and violent nature of the Prince with ſo much artifice and dexterity, that he had viſibly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated it in a ſhort time. But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be feared, leſt this great ardour of mind ſhould incline him to evil courſes, if he had endeavoured utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have ſuppreſſed it, he gave it all the liberty neceſſary, by encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging him in the purſuit of glory, of which one may ſay, That this wiſe Governour abandon'd all the Beauties to the violence of his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil's deſires. It is eaſie to imagine, that this education had imprinted in <hi>Don Carlos</hi> an extraordinary reſpect for the Emperour his Grandfather,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100068:29"/>
and that the endeavouring to blot the memory of that illuſtrious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, was an offence to him in the moſt ſenſible part of his Soul. <hi>Don John</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed in this glorious memory as well as he, were not leſs provoked with the affront. They blamed all three the King's weakneſs, who did not reſiſt this inſolence with all the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence they could have wiſh'd, and they conceived for him a contempt, that never ended but with their lives. And as they were yet too young to comprehend, that the moſt abſolute Kings have no rights ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred in the minds of their people, as thoſe that are taken from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion, they ſpake pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly of the attempt of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with as great tranſports of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as people of their quality were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of having, upon ſo juſtifiable a ſubject; nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they went ſo far as to threaten, that they would utterly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100068:30"/>
deſtroy the holy Office, and all its ſupports. The people, who learn'd theſe paſſages no otherwiſe, then as the Inquiſitors, or thoſe who were employ'd by them, were pleaſed to relate them, did teſtifie, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely they reſented ſuch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The King fore ſaw at the very firſt, the ill conſequences that might follow unto the Princes from their indignation, but knowing that they had ſo far forgot themſelves, as to blame ſome of his own actions, he would not ſpeak to them of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for fear of drawing upon him ſome diſreſpectful anſwer. <hi>Rui Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mez,</hi> whom he charged with this Commiſſion, acquitted himſelf of it with all the earneſtneſs, that the importance of the matter ſeem'd to require. <hi>Don John</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> who had naturally more the maſtery of themſelves then <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> rendred themſelves to his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and Ambition being their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100068:30"/>
paſſion, they had all the ſorrow imaginable, to have put ſo conſiderable an obſticle to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as the hatred of the Inquiſitors, which by this means they had brought upon themſelves, and by conſequence that of the People. The Prince on the contrary, whoſe nature was to be the more irritated by oppoſition, could never be brought to confeſs that he was in the wrong. In the mean time, the Doctor <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calla</hi> was burnt alive, with an Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies that repreſented <hi>Conſtantine Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> who was dead ſome days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Priſon. The King was forced to ſuffer this Execution, that ſo he might oblige the holy Office to ſuffer the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi> to appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's Will might be no more ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>This accommodation of affairs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> but it did by no means pleaſe the Inquiſitors; and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100068:31"/>
that being a ſort of people incapable of pardoning, they raiſed ſo great murmurings among the people, that what care ſoever the King could take, there was no way of making the noiſe ceaſe, but by abſenting the Prince from the Court for ſome time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alcala</hi> was then in its greateſt luſtre, and all the conſiderable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that went into <hi>Spain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> fail'd not to viſit ſo famous an Univerſity. The King pretended, that the Princes had the ſame curioſity; and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to haſten their voyage the more, was, that the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> was ſhortly to leave them, and to go under the conduct of the Count of <hi>Egmont</hi> into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he was to be married. When <hi>Don Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> knew this reſolution, and that now he muſt neceſſarily leave the Queen, he began to ſee the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice into which he had thrown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the intereſt of his love forced from his mind a repentance of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100068:31"/>
his paſt carriage, which was more then the intereſt of his ſafety and greatneſs could ever have done. The King, who could by no means endure to be ſeparated from <hi>Rui Gomez,</hi> obliged the Count of <hi>Egmont</hi> to take this Favourites place about the Princes during the voyage of <hi>Alcala.</hi> This Count was one of the moſt accompliſhed Captains of of his age, and was covered with the glory he had gotten in the laſt War at the Battels of St. <hi>Quintin</hi> and <hi>Gravelin,</hi> and of ſo many great men that had been formed in <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth's School, no one had ever had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhare then he in the eſteem of that Emperour. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma</hi> well foreſaw the ſtorm, that ſince that time was raiſed in the Provinces, which the King her Brother had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted her with, and ſhe judged it convenient to repreſent to him the inconveniences that were to be feared from thoſe novelties he had a mind
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100068:32"/>
to introduce. This Commiſſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a man of the quality and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> and one accuſtomed to ſpeak to Princes with that noble liberty, which is ſo uſeful to them, and of which ſo few of thoſe about them are capable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> who naturally loved all extraordinary men, engaged the Count to entertain him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they rode along<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a deſcription of the laſt Battel, in which he had commanded. The Count, who was charmed with his curioſity, ſatisfi'd it fully; and <hi>Don Carlos</hi> made appear an extreme impatiency of ſeeing himſelf in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to do ſomething like that he heard related; he aſſured the Count of <hi>Egmont,</hi> that if ever the troubles in <hi>Flanders</hi> came to break out in an open War, as the Governeſs ſeem'd to apprehend they would, nothing ſhould hinder h m from coming into thoſe Provinces, there to learn under him his Apprentiſhip of War.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:100068:32"/>
The voyage of the Princes was not long, the Town of <hi>Alcala</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented <hi>Don Carlos</hi> with a Horſe of great price, but as furious as he was handſome. The Prince having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee him mounted, was ill ſatisfi'd with all thoſe that rode him, and would needs try how he could ride him himſelf: The Horſe, whoſe mouth was already very much heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as ſoon as the Prince began to prick him, took a fright, and ran away with him with ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that <hi>Don Carlos</hi> thought it his beſt way to throw himſelf off; but he did it ſo unfortunately, that he was left for dead upon the place; and though he came to himſelf ſome hours after, yet when the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons had examin'd the wound he had received in his head, they all deſpaired of his life. In this extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he ſent the Marquis of <hi>Poſa,</hi> his Favourite, to carry his laſt Adieu to the Queen. The Princeſs of <hi>Eboli</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:100068:33"/>
went to him, at the firſt report ſhe heard of this accident, to ſee after what manner he would receive her. The diſſimulation of the Queen, who was not prepared for ſo rude a trial, abandon'd her at this news; and though her mouth, accuſtom'd to be ſilent, did not permit her grief to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it ſelf by complaints, her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the diſorder ſhe was in, diſcover'd more of her thoughts, then all the words in the world could have done. Yet how great ſoever her affliction ſeem'd to be, there had been always ſo much friendſhip ſeen between her and <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> that no body was ſurpriſed therewith. But the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli,</hi> that was a great proficient in the myſterious Sciences of Love, could not comprehend, how ſo violent a deſpair in the Queen, ſhould be nothing but an effect of friendſhip. In the mean time the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, inſpir'd by the Inquiſitors, did not ſeem to diſcover any great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100068:33"/>
for this misfortune, but look'd upon it as a manifeſt puniſhment of God upon <hi>Don Carlos</hi> for his impiety. The Queen, who thought ſhe had now nothing more to houſewife, could not refuſe her ſelf the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of letting the Prince know, the pitiful condition in which he left her. She wrote to him all that love and diſpair can ſuggeſt moſt tender and moſt affecting; and ſhe made the Marquis of <hi>Poſa</hi> go back to him, with order preſently to bring back her Letter, in caſe he ſhould not arrive at <hi>Alcala</hi> till after the death of <hi>Don Carlos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The joy with which the Prince's ſoul was filled at the receit of this Letter was ſo great, that it reſtored him his life. As ſoon as he was out of danger, the King made him be brought back to <hi>Madrid,</hi> thinking that the animoſity of the people would in part be appeaſed by this cruel adventure. The firſt time the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100068:34"/>
Queen ſaw <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> ſhe ask'd him for her Letter; but how earneſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe were to have it back, the Prince, to whom this teſtimony of her affection was dearer, then the life it had rendred him, perſiſted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in his reſolution to keep it, not thinking that this Letter was once more to decide his deſtiny. At his return, he found the Princeſs great with child, and her greatneſs did provoke his jealouſie to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that made him make ſo odd and unreaſonable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> complaints to her, that any body but ſhe would have thought that he had loſt his wits. Whilſt his Cure was finiſhing, ſhe lay in, of the Illuſtrious Arch-Dutcheſs of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Heireſs of her Beauty and Wit, as well as of her Name.

An infamous Villain called Captain <hi>Dominick,</hi> born in the Countrey of <hi>Bearn,</hi> was charged with the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the buſineſs, by reaſon of the perfect knowledge he had of the Countrey.

conſiderable Body of Horſe through the Mountains, and ſo to ſurpriſe the Queen and her Children at <hi>Pau</hi> in <hi>Bearn,</hi> where they made their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and where they had almoſt no other Guard then the hearts of their Subjects. But though their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign were wonderfully well laid, the great Deſtiny of the young Prince rendred it vain: It preſerved him to be one day the Reſtorer of <hi>France</hi> to its antient ſplendor, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> A little while before the voyage of <hi>Bayonne,</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain <hi>Dominick,</hi> aſſiſted by ſome Governours of the <hi>French</hi> Frontier, that depended upon thoſe who made him act, had diſpoſed all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary upon the places appointed for his attempt. After that he was gone into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he went to receive the Orders of the Duke <hi>D' Alva,</hi> for the advancement of the Troops deſtin'd for its execution. The Duke, who was then at <hi>Alva,</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:100068:36"/>
after ſome conference with him, ſent him back to the King, who held the States of the Kingdom at <hi>Mouzon.</hi> The Captain fell dangerouſly ſick in going thither, and was forc't to ſtay at <hi>Madrid,</hi> where he was neceſſarily to paſs. During his illneſs he was aſſiſted in all things by a French man a ſervant to the Queen, and who was his Countryman; Not knowing how to teſtifie his gratitude, he chanced one day to ſay to him, <hi>That his life was of greater importance then perhaps he thought, and that the care which was taken of him ſhould be one day magnificently rewarded.</hi> Theſe words were pronounced after a manner that might make one judge, they had ſome extraordinary foundation, and they cauſed in his Friend the curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of penetrating the Myſtery they ſeemed to contain. The Captain could refuſe nothing to a Man, to whom he thought he owed his life: And whether it were that the fear of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100068:37"/>
death had inſpired him with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of his crime, or that the Diſeaſe had diſturb'd his brain, he pay'd with this ſecret the ſervices he had received.

            </p>
            <p>At the recital of this horrible Plot ſhe could not withold her tears; and whilſt the Captain was curing, and ordering all things with the King that concern'd his Enterprize, ſhe made notice of it be given in <hi>Bearn,</hi> and at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where the Queen her Mother was at that time. The Attempt having failed in this manner, the Queen, conducted by the Duke <hi>d' Alva,</hi> went to meet the Court of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Bayonne:</hi> This Court was divided into two Factions, almoſt as great enemies, one of the other, as they were both one and the other of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> their common
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100068:37"/>
enemies. Although they were both Catholicks, one of them did more eſpecially attribute to themſelves this quality: It was that which was headed by the Friends of the Duke <hi>d' Alva,</hi> the firſt Authors of the <hi>Bearniſh</hi> Conſpiracy. And as they were already laying the foundations of the League, that appeared ten years afterwards, they lived in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect intelligence with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but it was not ſo with the other Faction, which was that of the King, and of which <hi>Catherine de Medicis</hi> was the chief; Arbitraryneſs, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency were the only end of all this Woman's Actions; ſhe knew, that all inward commerce with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was but ſo much ſlavery, and ſhe put no other truſt in the King her Son-in-law, and his Miniſters, then that to which ſhe was obliged by neceſſity, and her Relation to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:100068:38"/>
In the mean time, how reſerved ſoever ſhe were, the Complices of the Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi> having a familiar intercourſe with her upon account of ſome other intrigues, turned ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Stones, and ſet ſo many Spyes about her at this Interview at <hi>Bayon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> that at laſt they knew of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that it was the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> that had ruin'd their enterpriſe; but, they could never comprehend how this enterprize ſhould come to her knowledge.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi> could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ſo young a Woman was capable of venturing upon ſo bold and delicate an action.</p>
            <p>The familiarity of this Princeſs with Don <hi>Carlos</hi> had alwayes been ſuſpected by him, becauſe he knew that Don <hi>Carlos</hi> naturally hated him.</p>
            <p>He thought ſhe had done nothing without adviſing with the Prince; and, as there are but few g iefs ſo
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100068:38"/>
ſenſible, as that one feeles for having done a wicked Action to no purpoſe; He took ſo ſtrong a Reſolution to Revenge himſelf on them, that at laſt he brought it about. Yet Don <hi>Carlos</hi> knew nothing of this Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy before the voyage of <hi>Bayonne;</hi> but, the thing being afterwards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged, the Queen confeſſed the truth to him.</p>
            <p>The Prince amazed at the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of this villanous attempt, could not hinder himſelf from ſaying, in the preſence of Don <hi>John</hi> and the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli, That he would one day cruelly puniſh thoſe that gave ſuch baſe Counſel to the King his Father.</hi>

            <p>Theſe two Miniſters did equally ſhare the favour of the Court, onely with this difference, that one might ſay, That the Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi> was the Kings Favourite, and <hi>Rui Gomez</hi> the Favourite of <hi>Philip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This concurrence had ſometimes bred ſome difference between them, but their common intereſt reunited them upon this occaſion. The Duke <hi>d' Alva,</hi> who did Soveraignly govern all Military Affaires, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the warlike inclinations of his Prince, feared he would leſſen his Authority upon the firſt beginnings of any War, by taking the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it into his own hands. And he was perſwaded that Don <hi>Carlos</hi> would never pardon him a buſineſs
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100068:39"/>
that was paſt between them ſome years before.</p>

            <p>In this Ceremony it being come to the Duke <hi>d' Alvas</hi> turne to ſwear Fidelity, the Herauld called him by his Name three times in vain.

to be had for him? One went preſently to the King to demand it, and came back with this Anſwer, That he had obtained it: but, that he ſhould not be quit without loſing the Hand wherewith he had ſtruck the Queen. <hi>It would be a fine thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> (cryed he briskly at this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer) <hi>to ſee a one-handed King.</hi> He was told, That it was happineſs enough for him that the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf with this puniſhment: But, a perſon of the Company ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving repreſented to him in private, That if he ſubmitted himſelf to ſome voluntary Correction, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might be touched with ſome pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for him; he approved that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and ſent to pray the Cardinal <hi>Spinoſa</hi> to come and Whip him; a thing, which without that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he would never have done.</p>
            <p>Some years afterward, juſt upon his recovery from a Sickneſs he had had,

the King having taken him aſide to reprove him ſeverely for ſome fault, Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> who thought himſelf blamed wrongfully <note n="*" place="margin">Dicos y echos, di <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippe 2.</hi>
               </note>was ſo livelily toucht with what his Father ſaid to him, that he fell into a relapſe of his Fever at that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>So harſh an Education had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed the Prince to ſee all his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and Inclinations contradicted; and, as he was of a diſpoſition di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to that of his Father, he did not ordinarily govern himſelf after ſuch a manner, as the King could have deſired. This had often obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Rui Gomez</hi> earneſtly to deſire that he might be excuſed from wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him any longer; he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that the King would at laſt, as Fathers ordinarily do, accuſe him of the little comfort he had in his Son; but, this Favourite knew not, that thoſe people, who, like his Maſter,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100068:42"/>
think themſelves very wiſe, and who brag of conſtancy above all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, would a thouſand times ſooner condemn their own Children, then blame a Man they have once choſen; and, are not ſo much afraid of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfortunate in their Families, as unskilful in their judgments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rui Gomez</hi> ſeeing the Kings obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, to continue him in his charge, had us'd Don <hi>Carles</hi> with all rigour imaginable, as it were to take away all occaſion of blaming him for his ill conduct, ſo that he judged well that he was to fear all things from the reſentment of his Scholar; and, being ſollicited by his Wife, who, under pretence of taking care of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ſafety, revenged her deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fav urs: He did all things poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to obl ge the Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi> to joyne himſelf with him againſt Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> letting him know, how the Prince had threatned them both.</p>
            <p>What earneſtneſs ſoever the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100068:42"/>
of <hi>Eboli</hi> ſhewed to have her part in this combination; her Husband, who had ſome ſuſpition of the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of all her officiouſneſs, did not think it fit to entruſt her with ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a ſecret. She told him not all ſhe thought ſhe knew concerning the correſpondence betwixt <hi>Don Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> and the Queen. But <hi>Rui Gamez,</hi> who had a very piercing wit, making reflection in private upon what ſhe had told him, had ſoon divined the reſt. But what Idea ſoever he attempted to make in his mind concerning this correſpondence, he could never form ſo perfect a conception of it, as when he thought there was ſome love at the bottom. A thouſand things upon which he had not reflected at the time when they were done, came then into his memory. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred how he had obſerved, that when the Queen was ſpoken of in <hi>Don Carlos</hi> his preſence, that Prince look'd upon thoſe that ſpake of her,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100068:43"/>
as if he had feared, leſt they ſhould obſerve him at that time, and leſt that they ſaid of her had been onely to try him. In other occaſions, where it ſeemed, that all the company diſputed who ſhould praiſe the Queen beſt, <hi>Don Carlos</hi> praiſed her not at all in his turn, as the others did: and when he muſt neceſſarily ſpeak of her, he was always afraid of ſaying too little, and his mouth not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to diſguiſe the ſentiments of his heart, could ill do a thing it was ignorant of. <hi>Rui Gomez</hi> conſidered again, that though the Prince had no conſideration for all other women, yet he appeared before the Queen with a certain ſweetneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, that never bely'd it ſelf, and that render'd him uncapable of being known to thoſe that were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his humour. In fine, it was not hard to believe, that the marvellous beauty of that Princeſs, from which the moſt inſenſible were
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100068:43"/>
forced to turn away their eyes, and againſt which the oldeſt and wiſeſt men of the Court had much ado to defend their reaſon, ſhould make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart of a young Prince, who ſaw her familiarly every day, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion it made upon all other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rui Gomez</hi> was confirmed in his opinion, by communicating it to the Duke <hi>D' Alva,</hi> from whom he thought not to hide it. And as it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily happens, that when one hath diſcovered one part of a ſecret, the deſire one hath to know the reſt, makes one endeavour to Divine it, they began to doubt at that very time, that the Queen anſwer'd <hi>Don Carlos</hi> his paſſi n. This paſſion at firſt flatter'd their animoſity, they were glad for ſome moments that they had in their hands an infallible way of revenging themſelves upon this Prince, by diſcovering his Love to his Father: But afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make reflexion upon the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100068:44"/>
King's jealous humour, and upon his natural cruelty, they conſidered the ſtrange extremities, to which appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently it would carry him, and were ſtricken with horror at that thought. How redoubtable an enemy ſoever they had in the perſon of <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> they intended not to attaque his life, nor ever thought themſelves capable of ſuch an intent. No body becomes wicked all at once; and it is not for all ſorts of Souls to reſolve upon a great piece of villany the firſt time it comes into their thoughts. Vice is arriv'd to by degrees as well as Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Miniſters apprehended above all things, leſt the Queen ſhould preoccupy her Husband's mind about the affair of <hi>Bearn,</hi> ſo that afterwards he would not believe the truth. They judged, that in the inquietude the King was in, to know how this enterpriſe had been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, he would fix himſelf upon the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100068:44"/>
firſt opinion ſhould be given him of it. This Prince even deſperate with the ill ſucceſs of his deſign, looked no more upon the Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi> with ſo favourable an eye as he was wont to do, and perhaps meditated in his own heart his open diſgrace, thereby to diſcharge himſelf of the blame of this conſpiracy. To avoid this blow he was forced to diſcover to him the truth; but becauſe the end of this diſcovery was to convince the King, that it was not through the Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi>'s fault that their attempt had failed, the Duke did not judge it convenient to ſpeak to him himſelf. <hi>Rui Gomez</hi> was not much leſs ſuſpected th n he in this affair: he had almoſt as great a part in it as the Duke. They thought then that they had need of ſome third perſon to render them that good office: and finding none ſo proper for their pu poſe as <hi>Antonio Perez,</hi> the Secretary of State, they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100068:45"/>
reſolved to engage him in their intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. This man, who had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to hurt either the Prince or Queen, appeared to them difficult to be gained. Nevertheleſs <hi>Rui Gomez</hi> preſumed enough upon his addreſs, to attempt the bringing it about. The thing proved much eaſier to him then he thought. <hi>Perez</hi> was paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in love with the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli,</hi> and till then he had never been able to obtain any thing of her. He ask'd at firſt whether ſhe were of the ſecret; and being told that ſhe was not, after all the refuſals he knew he muſt make, he engaged himſelf to do all they deſired of him. This dextrous Lover knew how furious the Princeſs was; he doubted not but ſhe was almoſt deſperate, that an intrigue of that conſequence ſhould lie hid from her, and knew ſhe was capable of doing any thing to gratifie him that ſhould diſcover it to her. <hi>Rui Gomez</hi> went preſently to give an
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100068:45"/>
account of his negotiation to the Duke <hi>D' Alva,</hi> proud of his good ſucceſs, and the moſt contented man in the world to have given his Wife's Gallant an infallible way of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting her. And <hi>Perez</hi> knew ſo well how to make uſe of his Secret with his Miſtris, that he made her buy it as dear as he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Queen, who proved great with child at her return from <hi>Bayonne,</hi> lay in of the <hi>Infanta Katherine Michaelle,</hi> her Second Daughter, who was ſince Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy.</hi> The Miniſters, who knew the power the Queen's beauty gave her over her Husband's mind, thought fit to take the time of her lying in to juſtifie the Duke <hi>D' Alva,</hi> that ſo they might give the King the leiſure of forming a reſolution upon that they, intended he ſhould know, before he could have time to talk with the Queen by her ſelf. The charge <hi>Perez</hi> had of Forreign
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100068:46"/>
Affairs, gave him often opportunity of entertaining his Majeſty in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. On the morrow morning he brought in the diſcourſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of <hi>Bearn,</hi> upon this account, that they had heard, that the Queen of <hi>France</hi> ſeemed to be very angry at it, and that ſhe began to revenge her ſelf for it in favouring the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels in <hi>Flanders,</hi> who were then in the firſt Fits of their Fury. At fi ſt he confeſſed to the King, that he had a long time heſitated to diſcover to him what he knew, concerning the ill ſucceſs of this enterpriſe, what obligation ſoever lay upon him to do it; but that after having well thought upon it, he believed he could not without a crime continue to be ſilent: After that he recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him exactly that which the Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi> had learn'd at <hi>Bayonne,</hi> concerning the manner in which they had been diſcovered; he added the diſcourſes which <hi>Don Carlos</hi> had had
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100068:46"/>
upon this buſineſs, in preſence of <hi>Don John</hi> and the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli,</hi> againſt thoſe that were concerned in it; and he ended, in praying the King to pardon him the ſecret, he had till then made him of thoſe things, he could not tell him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offending in ſome ſort the Two Perſons of the world, who, after his own, ought to be moſt ſacred in his Subject's hearts.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe put the King's mind into an extraordinary perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xity; and though as yet he did not ſuſpect the Queen of any thing, his love made him find the union of ſentiments, which by this Affair ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be between her and <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> very ſtrange. His mind poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd by this firſt motion of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. made him look with indifference upon the attempt they had made upon his Authorit<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and the care of his Grandieur, which was ſo natural to him upon all other occaſions,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100068:47"/>
gave place, for this once, to a more ſenſible and more delicate conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. He obſerved then for the firſt time his Son's aſſiduity about his Wife, and he remember'd they had been a long while together deſtin'd for each other; but he came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to himſelf, and conſidering the vertue and courage of the Queen, he wholly condemned all ſuch weak ſuſpicions. She had already given other marks of the love ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for her Countrey. Some time before, the difference of the Precedency of the Two Crowns having been decided at <hi>Rome</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of that of <hi>France,</hi> ſhe could not ſo well diſſemble the joy ſhe had of it, but that ſhe let go ſome ſmall teſtimony of her mind. Her firſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Honour would have repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her, that ſhe ought to be more concerned in the diſcontent of her Husband upon this occaſion. But the Queen anſwer'd her, That as ſhe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100068:47"/>
did not wonder at the King's grief, ſo neither ought he to wonder at her joy; and that for her part ſhe was glad to have all the world know, <note n="*" place="margin">Father <hi>Hilarion</hi> of <hi>Coſſa,</hi> in his Elogy of this Queen.</note>that the Houſe out of which ſhe was iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, was better then that unto which ſhe had alli'd her ſelf. The King making reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon this diſcourſe, was fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that what ſhe had done againſt the enterpriſe of <hi>Bearn,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the ſame principle of affection for her Kindred; and he conſidered this horrible enterpriſe, in which <hi>Don Carlos</hi> ſeemed to deſire to out-vie the Queen, as a generoſity pardonable in ſo young a man.</p>
            <p>Yet though he was willing enough to be at quiet in this point, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to have a clearer knowledge of their commerce for the time to come; but he thought there was no other jealouſie mingled with this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100068:48"/>
reſolution, then that he ought to have of his Authority. He made great changes in the moſt important Offices of the Court, that ſo he might beſtow upon the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli</hi> the firſt of all thoſe of the Queen's houſhold, without making appear any affectation in his choice. The familiarity this woman had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> ever ſince her Husband had been his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, render'd her fitter then any other to penetrate into his ſecrets. This conſideration, joyn'd to that ſhe had already reported of the threatnings he had made in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, contributed as much as the favour of <hi>Rui Gomez,</hi> to make her be choſen by the King for this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> who thought ſtill that ſhe loved him, ever ſince that which had paſt between them, was not in the leaſt diſturbed at her new promotion; and the Queen, who knew that her Husband had
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100068:48"/>
too many friends in <hi>France,</hi> to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what ſhe had done, was no way ſurpriſed by all this change of Offices. She imagin'd the reaſon of it at fi ſt, and <hi>Don Carlos</hi> trying to re-aſſure her, in anſwering for the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli,</hi> the Queen preſs'd him to tell her, from whence came the great confidence he had in that Woman? but he could never get leave of his modeſty to ſatisfie her demand. Yet he perceived af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards that he was deceived, when he ſaw how carefully the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli</hi> watched them. And he not daring to complain of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience he received by her preſence, ſhe pleaſed her ſelf wonderfully in tormenting this poor Prince. She feigned to have more friendſhip for him then ever. Never failing to wait upon the Queen, whereſoever ſhe were, as ſoon as ſhe knew that he was with her, and ſhe made as if it had been her that drew her thither.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100068:49"/>
But though this Woman's vigilancy was incredible, the Queen and Don <hi>Carlos</hi> found a little while after an opportunity of entertaining one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in particular. The King, who was as much buſied about his Eſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as one may imagine, by the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expence he was a<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for it, invited the Queen to go ſee the beginnings of the Proud Structure he was raiſing, to be an eternal Monument of the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of St. <hi>Quintin.</hi> All that renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Princeſſes ſoul the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a Battle, that had been the fountain of all the misfortunes of her Life ought not apparently to be very pleaſing to her.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, ſhe ſaw the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations tha were made for immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing the memory of that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate day, with all the cheerfulneſs and expreſſions of contentment the King could have deſired of her, or that he had in himſelf. It was in this place that the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:100068:49"/>
left the Queen and Prince alone with the King, and that the King having alſo left them, to give his order to ſome of his Builders. Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> who could not longer live in ſuch a conſtraint, took that time to conjure the Queen to give him ſome aſſured meanes of talking with her in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, when it ſhould be neceſſary for their common intereſt ſo to do. He preſt her to it in ſo touching a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that ſhe conſented to him at the very firſt, ſeduced by that poor Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deſpair; So that they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to find out ſome probable wayes, but they all appear'd ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Queen, that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd never to make uſe of them, how eaſie ſoever Don <hi>Carlos</hi> would make her believe they were. The ſtate of Affaires ſtood thus, when the Marqueſs of <hi>Bergh,</hi> and the Baron of <hi>Monteigni,</hi> Deputies from <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> arrived at the Court. And as their Commiſſion was very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100068:50"/>
they had founded their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal hopes upon the report of the Princes generoſity, and the good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Queen. To be unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, was enough to deſerve the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of that Princeſs, and he that was vertuous had merit enough to pretend to the friendſhip of Don <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los.</hi> The Deputies repreſented to them the ſad condition of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſince the ill Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that the Cardinal of <hi>Cranvella,</hi> the principal Miniſter of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma</hi> their Governeſs had done them with the King. They exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated their innocence and fidelity in the paſt troubles. They particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conjur'd the Prince not to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſo many of the Emperors bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt Servants, and the moſt dear ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his tendereſt affections to the violent and precipitate counſels that the jealouſie of their Vertue, and the envy of their Glory inſpir'd the Duke <hi>d'Alva</hi> with, and, they aſſur'd him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:100068:50"/>
that the report of his courage was the onely conſolation they had in their misfortune.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> whoſe natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for the War had till then been ſuſpended by the violence of his love, was extreamly aſhamed at the hearing of this diſcourſe, that he had never yet done any thing for the getting of Glory; he was yet more animated by the Letters which the Deputies preſented him from the Count of <hi>Egmont:</hi> This Count ſummoned the Prince to make good the Promiſe he had given him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, to go in perſon into <hi>Flanders</hi> as ſoon as the Warr ſhould be there kindled. He repreſented the Affairs of thoſe Provinces in ſo favourable a diſpoſition for Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> that the Prince reſolved to make the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of them to be given to him, and hoped, when he ſhould be there, quickly to put himſelf into a condition of undertaking all that his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100068:51"/>
valour and ambition ſhould counſel him, after that the troubles ſhould be once appeaſed by his preſence. He had hardly well formed this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the Image of the Queen preſented it ſelf to his imagination more lovely and charming then he had ever yet ſeen her, and made him doubt whether he ſhould ever have the force to leave her or no; but, making a ſerious reflexion upon the State of his Affaires, he plainly ſaw, that all things ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm him in his firſt reſolution.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of their affection the extreame tenderneſs of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes Age, had not permitted her to hide from Don <hi>Carlos</hi> the eſteem and pitty ſhe was toucht with for him; but afterwards, time having made her wiſer, and perceiving that the teſtimonies of Friendſhip ſhe gave him, as innocent as they were, did yet nouriſh his Love; ſhe repreſented to him upon all occaſions the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100068:51"/>
of this Paſſion, and the miſeries to which it would expoſe them both. How much ſoever he were poſſeſſed with it, he could not hinder himſelf from acknowledging that ſhe was in the right, and he durſt not ſeem to take it ill that ſhe lived with him for ſome dayes after a more reſerved manner then ordinary. In ſo cruel a diſturbance of mind, he thought, that he ought to make one generous effort upon himſelf, to deliver this Princeſs from an unfortunate Paſſion, that gave her ſo juſt cauſes of inquietude; And that he could not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rid himſelf of it, then by a long abſence, and a great deal of buſineſs; He thought ſo indeed at firſt, but he quickly changed his mind at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Queen and conſidering what was the pleaſure of ſeeing her, he well perceived he ſhould never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to ſee her no more. In this thought he went and gave her an account of what had paſſed between
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100068:52"/>
the Deputies and him, and of the project he had formed. He askt her pardon a thouſand times over, for being able to think for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that he could live abſent from her; but, the Queen, who aimed at nothing but to cure him of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, obliged him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithſtanding his reſiſtance to purſue his deſign of the expedition into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and to make him reſolve upon it the more eaſily, ſhe repreſented to him, That this Voyage would diſſipate the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humour the King was in, through his ſuſpicion of their affection; and that, ſo being leſs obſerved at his return, and more conſiderable and abſolute, by reaſon of the glory he would doubtlesſly acquire, they might live together with leſs inquietude. Don <hi>Carlos</hi> partly perſwaded by theſe reaſons, but much more by the blind obedience he had ſworn to the Queen in all things, declared himſelf openly in favour of the Nobility of the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100068:52"/>
Low-Countries, to the great ſcandal of the Inqu ſitors, who held them to be almoſt all infected with Hereſie, and who had not yet forgotten the buſineſs of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth's Will. He made the King be told, That if he would give him the Government of theſe Provinces, he would be an we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to him upon his Life for their O edience. It would be difficult to expreſs to what a degree <hi>Rui Gomez</hi> and the Duke <hi>d'Alva</hi> were allarm'd at this deſign.</p>
            <p>The Authority that an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that conſequence was like to give to the Heire of the Crown, appeared to them to be their evident ruine. They judg'd, That at his return from this expedition, in which he would infallibly have good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, this Prince would be his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers firſt Miniſter, and that by conſequence they muſt depend upon him.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>d'Alva</hi> above all, who
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100068:53"/>
had the ſame pretenſions with Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> engaged <hi>Rui Gomez,</hi> who was more familiar with the King than he, to make him conſider, How much this enterpriſe would raiſe his Son above him in the hearts of the <hi>Flemmings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perez,</hi> without ſeeming to act by conſent with them, put him alſo in fear of the ſtrait League which Don <hi>Carlos</hi> would doubtleſs make with <hi>France,</hi> by the meanes of the Queen, if he were once Maſter of the Low-Countries.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Advertiſements</hi> made all the impreſſion they were capable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon the mind of a Prince na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally jealous of his Authority, and fearful of his Sons Ambition.</p>
            <p>The King thought no more of any thing, but how to refuſe Don <hi>Carlos</hi> with a good grace; and ſo, that he might not take his refuſal for an affront.</p>
            <p>He made him be told, That he
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100068:53"/>
granted his Requeſt; and, that he was raviſht that they had both hapned upon the ſame intention, but that he was reſolved to go himſelf, &amp; eſtabliſh him in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that they would ſhortly go away together for that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: that it would not be handſome for him to live ſecurely in <hi>Spain</hi> and in the mean time to expoſe his onely Son to the accidents of ſo fu ious a Rebellion; and that he would ſhare the danger with him, and afterwards let him reap all the Glory.</p>
            <p>The noiſe of this Voyage was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſpread abroad into all parts, by reaſon of the preparations the King made for it to deceive Don <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les;</hi> yet no body could believe it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, how groundleſs ſoever this noiſe appeared, it filled the minds of the Rebels, yet waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with terror; and the King, to confirm it more and more, made ſo conſiderable an Expence in Equipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100068:54"/>
that even <hi>Bergh</hi> and <hi>Monteigni,</hi> who had laught at it till then, cu ſt no longer doubt of its t uth. The Queen and Don <hi>Carlos</hi> were at firſt cheated by appearances, as well as the others, but they undeceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſooner then any.</p>
            <p>When the Equipages were finiſht, the King, who ſaw that people would ſoon be diſabus'd, if he began not his Journey, could find no other expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to excuſe his ſtay, but the feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſick. This pretence wrought its effect pretty well in the Countries afar off; but, what care ſoever he took to make his ſickneſs be believed in his Court, and what conſtraint ſoever this poor Prince brought himſelf under, to live after a manner, that might confirm the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he had a mind to give of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he could never deceive his Wife, and his Son.</p>
            <p>In this conjuncture, one day that a great deal of company that had
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100068:54"/>
been with the Queen, and had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed a long time about the Kings Voyage into <hi>Flanders,</hi> were gone out, Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> Don <hi>John,</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Eboli</hi> being left alone with her, at firſt they made an obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on altogether, How Courtiers do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten torment themſelves to divine the Cauſes, and effects of that which ſhall never be. After having ſome time laughed at thoſe that had ſpoken of the Voyage, Don <hi>Carlos</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly to laugh at the Voyage it ſelf, and at the violence the King did himſelf to counterfeit the ſick Man; He ſaid, That <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had made Voyages enough for himſelf, and his Son too, and that the King would repoſe both for himſelf, and his Father. The Queen did not hear theſe words, becauſe ſhe was obliged to talk privately with ſome perſons that had buſineſs with her.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, while Don <hi>John,</hi> and the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:100068:55"/>
talked ſoftly together, <hi>Don Carlos</hi> in a penſive poſture ſet himſelf to make a little Book, in which he wrote theſe words in Capital Letters upon the firſt page, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Brantome</hi> in his <hi>Philip</hi> the 2d.</note>
               <hi>The great and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Voyages of King Philip;</hi> and in every one of the other pages of the Book he wrote one of the following Titles, <hi>The Voyage from Madrid, to the Eſcurial, The Voyage from the Eſcurial to Toledo, from Toledo to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid, from Madrid to the Aranjuez, from the Aranjuez to the Pardo, from the Pardo to the Eſcurial.</hi> And after this manner, he filled the whole Book with the Kings Voyages to his Houſes of Pleaſure, and to ſome of the greateſt Townes in <hi>Spain.</hi> The Queen could not keep her ſelf from laughing at this imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prince, how dangerous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe thought it; but as ſhe read this paper, one came to tell her,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100068:55"/>
that the King was newly fallen into a ſwoon, and that he was very ill. At this news ſhe had onely the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to recommend the Book to <hi>Don Carlos.</hi> The Prince, who would needs follow her, as ſoon as might be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf to throw it into a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Cloſet, of which he ſhut the door after him. He knew not that the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli</hi> had falſe Keys to all the Queen's Locks. He was hardly out of the room, but ſhe ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon his writing; and when ſhe had ſeen what it was, ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely glad to have in her hands ſo conſiderable a means of prejudicing him in the King's mind. The firſt thing ſhe thought of, was, how ſhe might do to keep this Paper without any ones knowing that ſhe had it. She doubted not, but the Queen had ſeen the conſequence it might be of, and that ſhe would ſeek it, as ſoon as ſhe ſhould be come back. For this purpoſe, without loſing a moment of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100068:56"/>
time, ſhe cauſed another little Book to be made, in all points like that of <hi>Don Carlos</hi>'s, and which contained the ſame things. She made the Prince's writing to be perfectly well counterfeited, and put that falſe Book in the place of the true, which ſhe gave her Husband. The Queen, at her return, having found this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit writing in the ſame place, that <hi>Don Carlos</hi> had told her, was in ſo great haſte to burn it, that ſhe threw it into the fire, almoſt without read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing in it, no wiſe doubting this cheat.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the King's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling was turned into a reality. At his coming to himſelf out of the ſwoun he had been in, he was found to have a ſtrong Fever, which ſoon chang'd it ſelf into a regular Tertian Ague: but people gave leſs credit to his ſickneſs when it was true, then they had done, whileſt it was but feigned. The Rebels of <hi>Flandeos</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:100068:56"/>
ſeeing that this report had laſted ſo long, doubted no more but that it was a trick of that Princes policy. And in that opinion they purſued their deſignes with more heate then before. This news redoubled both the Kings melancholy and his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Don <hi>Carlos</hi> ſeeing that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he ſhould make to be ſent into <hi>Flanders</hi> would but diſquiet him more and more, would not renew them; but his Father, who thought him not ſo diſcreet, and who ſaw him unceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly by his bed-ſide, took his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity for a dumb ſollicitation; yet this aſſiduity had other reaſons: The Queen never abandoning the ſick man, Don <hi>Carlos</hi> could not ſee her any where elſe but living in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with great circumſpection, and not daring almoſt to ſpeak to one another before him. Don <hi>Carlos</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered very much by this conſtraint, and their intereſts received a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable prejudice by it: In ſo delicate a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100068:57"/>
conjuncture, they had a great many advices to give one another, and a great many meaſures to take by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. There was no hopes that the K ng would be cured of a long while, and the Phyſicians aſſured them, that his Ague would be of a great length. The Queen and <hi>Don Carlos</hi> judging, that there would be too much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in writing to one another, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to chuſe ſome faithful perſon, to whom they might ſafely tell what they would have one another know. The Prince, who thought that his Uncle <hi>Don John</hi> had been their very good friend, caſt his eyes upon him, to honour him with this confidence: But the Queen thought, ſhe had ſeen divers times in the eyes of this Uncle, ſomething that ſpake to her of Love; and ſhe had obſerved ſome kind of officiouſneſs in the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli</hi> for this ſame <hi>Don John,</hi> that ſhewed there was ſome intelligence between them. Theſe conſiderations
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100068:57"/>
obliged the Queen to make <hi>Don Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> change his deſign, yet without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him with her reaſons. The Prince had not dared to propoſe to her the Marquiſe of <hi>Poſa,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, becauſe ſhe knew him not ſo particularly as ſhe did <hi>Don John.</hi> This Favourite was the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd of all the Noblemen, who had been bred up in the quality of Children of Honour, or Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the young Princes. Although he had a great deal of vivacity, he was one of thoſe naturally regular Souls, equally capable of force and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> who had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent faculty of diſcerning, had at firſt remarked a character of mind, ſo rare amongſt young people. The Marquis was no leſs charmed with the ardour that <hi>Don Carlos</hi> teſtifi'd for all great and noble things; and they had formed for one another an affection, hardly enough to be found between a Prince and a Courtier,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100068:58"/>
becauſe it was founded upon nothing, but the mutual admiration of each others vertue. And as there is no Perſonage at Court more hard ot dangerous to act, then that of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite to the Heir of the Crown, the Marquis had entreated <hi>Don Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> to make the leaſt noiſe he could of the privacy, wherewith he was pleaſed to honour him. So that though they lived in a perfect union, there appeared almoſt nothing of it in publick, onely that the Prince found his converſation much more agreeable then that of other people, and all the world did the like. The myſtery they made of their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, rendred this Favourite more fit to ſerve the Queen and <hi>Don Carlos</hi> upon this occaſion. And not being known to be ſo much devoted to the Prince, as indeed he was, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes he ſhould have with the Queen would be much the leſs ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. But ſhe, knowing that <hi>Don

Carlos</hi> was eaſily to be deceived, would het ſelf examine the Marquis of <hi>Poſa,</hi> before ſhe would open ſelf to him. The firſt time ſhe met him, at the King's Apartment, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſome command ſhe had to lay upon him, ſhe found the means of engaging him in a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. His prudence appeared to her ſo great, that ſhe was even charmed therewith. He was not leſs taken with the Queen's wit; and his natural moderation was never of ſo great uſe to him, as upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Conſidering the manner in which this Princeſs made her ſelf known to him in this diſcourſe, which was heightned by the luſtre of her beauty, and her charming ſweetneſs, any other man, that had not been ſo abſolutely Maſter of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as he was, would doubtleſs have fallen in love with her. But though he did not do ſo, they could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one another in the reſt of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100068:59"/>
commerce they had together, from conceiving for each other all the eſteem and friendſhip they both me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited.</p>
            <p>We are always apt enough to believe, that people divine thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſentiments, that are truly ours; but we fear not being ſuſpected of thoſe we have not. The Queen, who troubled her head about nothing, but hiding thoſe that <hi>Don Carlos</hi> had for her, and who had none for the Marquis of <hi>Poſa,</hi> but what were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſonant to reaſon, took not ſo much care as ſhe ought to have done to conceal them. She feared not being ſuſpected of having any cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal ones for that Favourite. The Marquis, that he might anſwer her goodneſs as he ought, was often engaged to ſhew more eagerneſs for her ſervice, then the exact rules of Prudence would have permitted to be ſeen. And as they we e neither of them without enemies, this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100068:59"/>
quickly made a noiſe in the world. But they not imagining it would ſo do, becauſe they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of their own innocency, hardly took any notice thereof.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the King was cured, and the Queen proved with child. At firſt he was extremely glad of it, whether it were out of the hopes of having another Son beſides <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> or that as yet doubting of the perfect eſtabliſhment of his health, this greatneſs appeared to him to be an aſſured mark of it; but his joy was not of long continuance.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters, who were afraid of the ſecret favonr of the Marquis of <hi>Poſa,</hi> ordered the matter ſo, that the Queen's commerce with this Marquis came quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the knowledge of the King. This ſuſpicious Prince, at the very firſt notice thereof, had his mind troubled with jealouſie; and not finding his reckoning in ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100068:60"/>
of time, he was pleaſed to make upon the ſtate of his Wife's greatneſs, <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note>did not ſtick to think the Marquis guilty of a crime, that would have drawn upon him more envy then all his vertues. This thought made a ſtrange diſorder in his heart. All the graces both of body and mind, that nature had ſo liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on this unfortunate Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and that were capable of touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt barbarous Soul, rendred him by ſo much the more odious to the King, as that Prince conſidered no more all thoſe precious Talents, but as ſo many criminal charms, that had ſeduced his Wife's heart. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, how dangerous ſoever this diſpoſition of the King's mind were, perhaps his reaſon would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to him, had it not been for a thing that hapned at that very time, and which made him fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100068:60"/>
what he did but ſuſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

               <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Mezeray,</hi> in his Great Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</note> Among other publick teſtimonies of joy, that were made for his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there was a magnificent Tourna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which every Cavalier was obliged to declare himſelf for ſome Lady of the Court, and to wear her colours. The evening before this great day, the Marquis of <hi>Poſa</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be in the Queen's chamber, which was full of company, ſhe made him name to her all the Ladies, that had Knights to defend their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Prince and <hi>Don John</hi> were the onely men that could declare themſelves to be hers; and they not having done it, perhaps through fear of diſcovering ſomething of what they had in their Soul, it ſo fell out, when they had done ſpeaking, that the Queen was the onely perſon that had no body to run for her. She
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100068:61"/>
obſerved it her ſelf, and complaining of it in a Jeſting way, the Marqueſs, who knew he might uſe any ſort of pleaſantry with her, told her with a wonderful ſerious look, <hi>That ſhe muſt blame Nature for it; and, that if ſhe had been Beautiful like the others, ſhe would doubtleſs have found ſome Knight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they had done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All the Company applauded this Raillery, and the Queen anſwered him as ſeriouſly, as he had ſpoken,</hi> That, to puniſh him for his inſolency, ſhe commanded him to be her Knight, that ſo he might have the ſhame of ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt beautiful of all the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>This Gallantry was publick, and all the People of the firſt quality at Court were witneſſes of it.</p>
            <p>Yet the King could not keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from thinking, that there was ſome Myſtery in it, and that this converſation was an Artifice of the Queen, to give her Lover an aſſured
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100068:61"/>
meanes of declaring himſelf for her with impunity: Yet, he was not at firſt fully confirmed in this opinion; but on the morrow morning, when he ſaw the Marqueſs enter into the Liſts, carrying for his Device upon his Shield a Sun in its higheſt elevation, with theſe words, <hi>Nothing can ſee me without being burnt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Prince was fully perſwaded of the ſad thought that ſtuck in his mind: The unfortunate Knight won the Prize of the firſt Courſes, and though that were ordinary enough with him, the King at this time took his addreſs for an effect of his Love; and, this imagination toucht him ſo to the quick, that he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to let the Juſting be finiſhed: And he fe<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gned that he found himſelf ill, to have a pretence of breaking them off, and to hinder People from perceiving the fury into which this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Spectacle had put him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:100068:62"/>
At firſt he reſolved to give the Marqueſs of <hi>Poſa</hi> his death in ſuch a manner, that neither he nor the Queen could be ignorant of its cauſe; but <hi>Rui Gomez,</hi> whom he conſulted about it, made him ſee the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of a buſineſs of that nature, and that was like to make ſo much noiſe. He let him know the ſtrait Friendſhip that was between Don <hi>Carlos</hi> and this Marqueſs, and made him comprehend that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was not to be feared from the reſentment of the Prince, for the loſs of a Perſon ſo dear to him, if once he came to know the Authors of it.</p>
            <p>He contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <note place="margin">* Mayern Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet.</note>to have the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs Stab'd ſome time afterwards, one night in the Streets, as he was reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf from Court; the better to keep the truth of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from being inſpected, when the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100068:62"/>
Aſſaſſines ſaw him dead, they feigned in the preſence of his Attendants, that they had taken him for another Man. The Queen reſented, as ſhe ought, the loſs of ſo perfect a friend, and ſhe ſaw, at the very firſt, all ſhe was conſequently to ſuffer by it. As for Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> he could not at firſt diſcover the true cauſe of it, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he conſidered the little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance there was, that a Man ſo well known, as the dead Man was, ſhould be taken for another: On the other ſide, he ſaw, that there was no body but his Father that durſt undertake ſuch an attempt, ſo that he did not heſitate no more then the Queen, to divine, who was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it. In the mean time they neither of them miſtruſted, that it was of the Marqueſs that the King had been Jealous, and imagining ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which was like to have been, then that which really was; they thought that this Favourite had been
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100068:63"/>
killed as a Confident, and not as a Lover, and that they were diſcovered. In this opinion, conſidering the Kings unmeaſurable paſſion for his Wife, his averſion for the Prince, and his natural inclination to ſhed blood, they judged themſelves loſt.</p>
            <p>And they thought, that the King being well aſſured that they could not eſcape his vengeance, had begun by this Aſſaſſinate, that ſo he might make them feel it the longer.</p>
            <p>There is nothing ſo ſecret in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Courts that is not diſcovered by ſome people, which one doth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt. Don <hi>Carlos</hi> much about this time, ſitting down one day at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, found under his Plate a Paper, which contain'd theſe words.</p>
            <p>There are ſome very juſt Counſels which yet are not given, but one comes not out of deſperate affaires, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary reſolutions. Thoſe, in whom Heaven hath put ſuch qualities,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100068:63"/>
as are to render a great many others happy, beſides thoſe that poſſeſs them, are obliged to accompliſh their deſtiny, which prevailes over all other Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Generous Soules periſh not but for want of having an opinion bad enough of the wicked. That Patience, which abandoneth the dayes of a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Man to the violence of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, is weakneſs, baſeneſs of heart, crime, and not virtue. Humanity for thoſe that have none, is the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſort of folly.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Prince reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to try one innocent way, before he would have recourſe to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extremity. This way was, to renew with great earneſtneſs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt he had made to be ſent into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where the ſtate of Affairs demanded a more preſent, and ſpeedy remedy then ever; He did it in termes, that made the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that he would have what
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100068:64"/>
he deſired, and that there was no ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to refuſe him; He judged it his beſt way to expreſs his mind in this abſolute manner, for he thought, that if he were diſcovered, he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to Husband, and if he were not, it might happen that the King, ſollicited by his jealouſie, and affrighted by this imperious way of proceeding, wou'd grant him any thing in the World to be rid of him.</p>
            <p>This unfortunate Father, whoſe mind was more free to ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of his Cruelty, after he had ſatisfied it, was again fallen into his natural timidity: He ſaw plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he muſt neceſſarily ſend an Army into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and he was afraid of irritating Don <hi>Carlos</hi> his reſentment, yet freſh for the death of his Friend, if he refuſed him the Command of this Army, which he demanded in ſuch high termes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rui Gomez,</hi> who had found the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100068:64"/>
King ſo reſolute in the buſineſs of the Marqueſs, was not a little aſtoniſhed to ſee him ſo unreſolved in an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of much greater importance. The Intereſt which this Miniſter had in his Maſters welfare, made him look with dread upon the weakneſs of that Prince, who was going to put the Arms into his Sons hands, wherewith he was like to have his own Throat cut the firſt.</p>
            <p>As there is no Reaſon ſo ſtrong, as fear, to oblige the moſt unſtable ſpirits to determine themſelves, the King was ready to reſolve himſelf in favour of Don <hi>Carlos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rui Gomez,</hi> who ſaw it well, knew not how to hinder it, but having a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preſent wit, he be thought himſelf all of a ſudden of that Book of the Kings Voyages, which his Wife had found in the Queens Cloſet, written with Don <hi>Carlos</hi> his hand, and which he had lookt upon ever ſince as a Toy, which might yet prodnce ſome
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100068:65"/>
great effect, if it were employed with diſcretion; And, now he thought he had found the occaſion of uſing it.</p>
            <p>He told the King, That he thought himſelf obliged to let him know a little thing, that till then he had not thought worthy of acquainting him with, but which in the preſent conjuncture, would help him much the better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to gueſs at the Genius and Sentiments of his Son.</p>
            <p>The King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom this affair ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared of greater conſequence then <hi>Rui Gomez</hi> made ſhew of thinking it, would needs examine the Book him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and, knowing it to be of his Sons own Writing, he entred into a profound thoughtfulneſs, in which this Miniſter thought it beſt to leave him.</p>
            <p>After that he was a little come to himſelf, from the firſt trouble of Mind, into which ſo bloody a Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, made by two perſons ſo dear unto
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100068:65"/>
him, had at firſt caſt him; his anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſuſpicions of Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> his love for the Queen, awakened themſelves in his Soul with more violence then ever. He could not comprehend that a Wife and a Son ſhould divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that manner, at the coſt of a Father and a Husband that was their King, without living in the moſt Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Familiarity: But, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Poſa</hi> coming preſently into his Mind, he could not believe that the Queen was in Love with them both, eſpecially, Don <hi>Carlos</hi> and the Marqueſs being ſo united as they were; and, he concluded, that it muſt neceſſarily be, that one was the Lover, and the other the Confident: yet, what effort of wit ſoever he could make, he could never determine in himſelf which was the Lover. But, which ſoever of the two it were, he ſtill found that the death of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs was but too juſt, and that Don <hi>Carlos</hi> was equally culpable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:100068:66"/>
However the matter went, he would not authorize the Railleries his Son made upon his manner of life, by giving him the means of leading ſo different a one in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this Prince, who had yet done nothing, had the boldneſs to treate his Father with ſo much contempt, what would he not have dared to have done, if Fortune had been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to his ambition?</p>
            <p>The King made him be told, That in the fearful diſorder in which <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> was, he thought he could not ſend him thither, without expoſing his life to inevitable danger; but, that the Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi> ſhould go thither with a powerful Army within a ſhort time, and that as ſoon as this Army ſhould have rendred his ſide the ſtrongeſt, he ſhould be free to do whatever he would deſire.</p>
            <p>This refuſal fully confirmed the Prince in the opinion he had, that his ruine was reſolved upon, ſo that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100068:66"/>
he rendred himſelf to the inſtances that the Rebels of <hi>Flanders</hi> had been a long time making to him by the Count of <hi>Egmont</hi> and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, to go and put himſelf at their head. They promiſed him, That if he would grant them a few things, that were very reaſouable, they would obey him with more fidelity, then the Catholicks obey'd the King.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Carlos</hi> doubted not, but that if he were once Maſter of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted People, the King would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon to him the reſt of <hi>Flanders,</hi> though it were but to hinder him from poſſeſſing himſelf of it by force, as it would be eaſie for him to do.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Bergh</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teigni</hi> had ſeveral Conferences with him upon this Project, and they took together ſo juſt and ſo ſolid Meaſures for the executing of it, that they could not fail of ſucceſs,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100068:67"/>
provided, that the Prince conſerved to himſelf the liberty of Acting. It was that to which they exhorted him principally, and if he had taken their Counſel, he had began his journey at that very time. But, Don <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> judged, that there would be too much raſhneſs in declaring himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that manner, before he had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the correſpondency that were neceſſary for him: but, he promiſed them, that in the mean time, he would make uſe of ſuch powerful precautions for the ſafety of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he ſhould be able to give them a good account of it. <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. de <hi>Thou.</hi>
               </note>Beſides, a Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer filled with Fire Armes, which he made be ſet at his Beds-head; he cauſed ſome little Piſtols to be made, of a new Invention, to carry alwayes about him, without being ſeen. And that he might hinder himſelf from being ſurpriſed in his ſleep, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100068:67"/>
a famous French Artiſt, who workt at the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> to make a kind of Lock for his Chamber that could not be open'd but on the inſide, and he put every night under his Bolſter two Swords and a Caſe of Piſtols.</p>
            <p>Whilſt this unfortunate Prince haſtened perhaps his undoing, by the ſole opinion he had that he was undone; his Enemies forgot nothing to take from him all wayes of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling himſelf with his Father. The King had not yet ſeen the Queen in private, ſince the death of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Poſa,</hi> and they feared that all their labour would prove to be in vain, if he ſaw her again, and that ſhe would eaſily take out of his heart all that which they had put into it. Although it might happen that what they feared ſhould not come to paſs, yet it was poſſible that it might come to paſs: And conſidering the conſequence of which the thing was
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100068:68"/>
to them, they ought not to put any thing to the hazard.</p>
            <p>To take from this Princeſs the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of undoing in one night, that which had coſt them ſo much care and time, they bethought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of a meanes which would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ridiculous, if it had not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100068:68"/>
was to paſs, to obſerve thoſe that they found fit for the uſe which the Phyſicians were to make of them. Theſe unknown perſons ſpread ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral a fear in all their way, that all the people thought no more of any thing, but how to hide from them that which they pretended to ſeek. The Queen-Mother having diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Authors of this horrible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, made ſome of them be taken; They diſcovered at their death by whom they had been ſet on; but, thoſe which received their Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, judged it not ſafe for them to divulge it.</p>
            <p>If the continual infirmities of the King made ſo extravagant a calumny be ſo eaſily believed among his own People, it is not hard to judge of the effect it produced in Forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where thoſe ſorts of Newes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes find more credit then in the places where they are done. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> teſtified a great deal of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100068:69"/>
trouble about it. He was afraid that his Wife had ſome ſecret diſpoſition to this ſame illneſs, which is often an hereditary diſtemper. The Small pox which ſhe had had ſince that, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with ſome equivocal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that were common with that infirmity. They reſolved to make the King believe, That ſhe had had ſome others, much more dangerous then the former at this laſt greatneſs. And as he had a mind very eaſie to be wrought upon in that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd his health, they thought that if they ſtrengthned this ſtory by the teſtimony of ſome perſons not to be ſuſpected, it would be enough to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from ever ſeeing his Wife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in private. The Princeſs of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli</hi> was to give him the firſt notice of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe was obliged ſo to do, by the fidelity ſhe had promiſed him, in the employment ſhe had about the Queen. And that ſame French-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for whom Don <hi>John</hi> had formerly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100068:69"/>
made appear ſome inclination, was to confirm that which the Princeſs ſhould ſay. This young woman was one of thoſe medling ſpirits, born for the management of an intrigue; and ſhe was inconſolable, that all the favour ſhe had with her Miſtreſs, had never been able to intereſt her in any important confidence. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Eboli</hi> commanded Don <hi>John</hi> to counterfeit the Lover a ſecond time, by that meanes abſolutely to gain to them this dangerous Perſon. This Prince, who found ſome ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in troubling the Kings happineſs, obeyed with great eagerneſs. But the young woman, much offended by the coldneſs he had had for her, would not believe him except he gave her ſome extraordinary aſſurances. Don <hi>John,</hi> in haſte to finiſh his buſineſs, did not ſtick to make her a promiſe of Marriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon condition that ſhe ſhould tell the King whatſoever they would have her. The thing ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100068:70"/>
much more eaſily then they had hoped. The King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe Love was already changed into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, ran blindly into the Snare they had laid for him. The Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi> who had deferred his Voyage, to attend the Succeſs of this Artifice, went away for <hi>Flanders</hi> the day after. He took leave of Don <hi>Carlos</hi> in termes that were conformable to the anſwer which the King had made to that Princes laſt requeſts: And Don <hi>Carlos</hi> treated the Duke very ill for fear of having his deſigns ſuſpected, if he had appeared too calme in an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, which ought to touch him ſo ſenſibly.</p>
            <p>In the mean time this Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from all parts the beſt newes he could have wiſhed for. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the Admiral <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> with whom he was to conſult upon all he had to do, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and haſtned him by their Letters, whether it were to ſerve
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100068:70"/>
him or to undo him, God knows. The revolted party in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> abſolutely confiding in his generoſity, demanded of him no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. But that which perfected his reſolution, was, the aſſurance of a conſiderable Fleet, which the Grand Signior was to ſend upon the coaſt of <hi>Flanders,</hi> to favour all his deſigns. But as his principal hope was founded upon this aſſiſtance, it is neceſſary to conſider this buſineſs in its firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> de Thou, Strada, &amp;c.</note> At the time that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs of the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> for the Emperour her Brother, a certain <hi>Jew,</hi> that was a <hi>Portuguez</hi> by birth, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>John Miquez,</hi> for whom ſhe had a very particular eſteem, raviſh'd in her Court a young Lady of the firſt Quality, and of an extraordinary beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the kindred of this fair perſon, having made the Raviſher be driven
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100068:71"/>
out of all the States of Chriſtendom, where he ſought for a Sanctuary, he retir'd himſelf to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Caramania,</hi> to the Court of <hi>Selimus,</hi> eldeſt Son of <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the Magnificent.</hi> This young Prince, who was confin'd to that Countrey by his Father, according to the cuſtome of their Houſe, had no other care then how to paſs the time as well as he could in the midſt of pleaſures and divertiſements, in expectation of the Empire. <hi>Miquez,</hi> amongſt other Talents, poſſeſs'd the Art of diverſifying theſe pleaſures after a hundred ſeveral manners, of which every one had a new and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular charm. He knew how to give them that ſweet point, which makes them be felt with ſo much delight, and which is ſo eaſily blunted by an unskilful hand. And having culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, by a long and curious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, the Genius he had for that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he had carri'd it to a perfection
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100068:71"/>
infinitely beyond the imagination of Vulgar. Swell'd with pride for his skill in theſe rare Arts, he doubted not, but he ſhould in a ſhort time have the firſt place in the favour of a Prince like <hi>Selimus,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood perfectly the worth of volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſneſs. This man knew, that thoſe ſervices which make the greateſt noiſe, are not always thoſe that are moſt ſenſible to the hearts of Sovereigns. It ſeems, that thoſe one renders them in publick, are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently recompenced by the glory that follows them; but they alone can recompence thoſe which are known by no body but themſelves. The ſucceſs ſurpaſſed <hi>Miquez</hi> his hopes, and <hi>Solyman</hi> dying in this conjuncture, the <hi>Jew</hi> ſaw himſelf by theſe glorious ways the declared Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of the greateſt Prince upon earth. This high degree of power quickly gave him the occaſion of ſatisfying the deſire of revenge, which
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100068:72"/>
the perſecution that he had ſuffered had engraven in his heart againſt the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> One day as he was in a debauch with the Sultan, that Prince having admir'd the excellency of the Wine of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the Jew fell a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at him, for the paſſion he ſhewed for a Liquor that grew out of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and he told him that he ought to ſpare it more then he did, becauſe he bought it. <hi>Selimus</hi> a little netled with this raillery, ſwore that he would take <hi>Cyprus</hi> that very year; and he added, ſtriking the <hi>Jew</hi> upon the ſhoulder with his hand, that becauſe <hi>Miquez</hi> loved that marvellous Wine no leſs then he, he declared him, from the time they were ſpeaking, King of that Iſland, which yet, he ſaid, was but a ſmall part of the gratitude he owed him.</p>
            <p>At the time that all things diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves for this enterpriſe, the Moors of <hi>Granada</hi> were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that famous riſing, which brake
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100068:72"/>
forth ſoon afterwards. They ſent their Deputies to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, to beg its aſſiſtance. <hi>Miquez</hi> preferring the pleaſure of revenging himſelf, before that of making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a King, undertook their buſineſs with ſo much heat, that he made his Maſter reſolve to ſend to their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the redoubtable Navy that was then Equipping, for the conqueſt of the Kingdom that was deſtin'd to be his. He had conſerved great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gave advice to the Conſiſtory of <hi>Antwerp</hi> of this important diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This Conſiſtory, which was the principal Council of the Rebels, having received at the ſame time the news of Don <hi>Carlos</hi> his Engagement in their favour, ſent word thereof to <hi>Miquez:</hi> and to teſtifie how much truſt they put in the Prince, they ſent him the Jews Diſpatches, and his Cipher, that ſo he might himſelf negotiate with him at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:100068:73"/>
if he thought it uſeful for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt ſo to do. Don <hi>Carlos</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, for the greater ſurety, that this Fleet, which was to take Land upon the Coaſt of <hi>Granada,</hi> might be land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Flanders.</hi> He wrote of it to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, and <hi>Miquez</hi> anſwer'd him, that the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> of the Sea had a ſecret Order to do whatſoever the Prince ſhould command; whether it were that the thing were true, or that they had onely a deſign to make it believed, thereby to engage Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> at what price ſoever it were.</p>
            <p>About this time, one night, as he was at play with his Uncle, at the Queen's Lodgings, they had ſome difference between them, in which Don <hi>John,</hi> who was vex'd at his loſs, was carried by his paſſion to ſay ſome things againſt the Prince, beyond the bounds of liberty that his Play could give him with the Son of his King. Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> who knew himſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, anſwered him in few words,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100068:73"/>
with moderation enough; but yet in terms that ſeem'd to reproach him with the defect of his birth, to make him remember his duty. Don <hi>John</hi> touch'd in ſo ſenſible a part, was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged therewith to the point of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the Prince, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Brantome</hi> in his Diſcourſe of <hi>Philip</hi> 2d.</note>That it was true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that he was a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, but that which comforted him for it, was, that he had a better Father then he. This word drew out all Don <hi>Carlos</hi> his patience: he treated his Uncle ſo rudely, that on the morrow morning there ran a report, that he had given him a box on the ear. The Queen and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Eboli,</hi> who were preſent, had much ado to hinder them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to blows. The Queen eſpecially, who was frighted with every thing in this conjuncture, and as if ſhe had had ſome ſecret preſentiment of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of this quarrel, employ'd all her Authority to oblige them to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100068:74"/>
make up the difference upon the place: but it was not done with an equal ſincerity on both ſides.</p>
            <p>The King, to be faithfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed of whatſoever paſſed at the Queen's apartment, had linked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a ſtreight commerce with the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli:</hi> This woman had obliged Don <hi>John</hi> to obſerve the Prince's actions more narrowly then ordinary, ever ſince the death of the Marquis of <hi>Poſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was eaſie to <hi>Don John</hi> to acquit himſelf of this Commiſſion. The Prince, who though him his beſt friend, had told him ſomething of his deſign in general terms; but though Don <hi>John</hi> had forgot nothing to know the particulars of it, he had not as yet been able to learn any thing of them. Yet ſince their difference, the deſire of revenge had made him ſo clear-ſighted, that what care ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Don <hi>Carlos</hi> took to furniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with Arms in ſecret, Don <hi>John,</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:100068:74"/>

                  <hi>Hiſtoria de</hi> D. Juan <hi>d'</hi> Auſtria.</note> what by addreſs, and what by money, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it at the end. The King judged well, that the Prince did not take all theſe precautions, to have them always about him, he comprehended pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, that his Son muſt either have ſome deſign to ſteal away, or to do him ſome violence. He knew not which of the two to think, when Don <hi>Raimond de Taxes,</hi> Maſter of the Poſt-Office, came to advertiſe him, that a <hi>French-man</hi> belonging to the Queen, had demanded of him very ſecretly three Horſes, to be ready to go away at the beginning of the night. This advice drawing the King out of the doubt in which he was, caſt him into a greater, which was, whether he ſhould content himſelf to make the Prince be watched, ſo that he could not poſſibly eſcape; or whether he ſhould all of a ſudden make him to be arreſted. But <hi>Perez</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:100068:75"/>
bringing to him at the ſame time the news of the <hi>Moores</hi> riſing, which he had newly received; the King af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted by ſo many unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures, reſolved to aſſure himſelf of his Son's perſon.</p>
            <p>It was true, that the Prince's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture was reſolv'd upon for that night: he had received a few days before ſome news out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> that permitted him no longer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. The Counts <hi>d' Egmont</hi> and <hi>de Horn,</hi> truſting to the innocence of their intentions in their paſt carriage, and to the merit of their ſerv ces, had delivered themſelves into the hands of the Duke <hi>d' Alva,</hi> who made them be put in priſon, and a little while after cut off their heads. So manifeſt a piece of treachery had caſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels into deſpair, and their Leaders, ſeeing there was no more ſafety for them but in their Arms, made Don <hi>Carlos</hi> eaſily ſee, in acquainting him with theſe things, that it would ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100068:75"/>
be too late to help them. He wrote forthwith to Don <hi>Garcia Alvartz O<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> who was to be the companion of his flight, to come incontinently to him. The Prince had ſent him to <hi>Sevil,</hi> there to receive a conſiderable ſum of money; but not having time to make uſe of all the diligence requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, he brought him <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cabrera</hi>'s Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Philip</hi> 2d. <hi>Hiſtoria de Dom.</hi> Juan <hi>d'</hi> Auſtria.</note>but an hundred and fifty thouſand Crowns. As Don <hi>Carlos</hi> retired himſelf from the Queens lodgings, <hi>Rui Gomez</hi> walk'd with him, to give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count on the King's part of the news they had received from <hi>Granada.</hi> This Miniſter entertain'd him ſo late, that the Prince ſeeing he had not night enough left to go ſo far as he deſired, before his flight could be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, thought it his beſt way to put it off till the morrow. <hi>Rui Gomez</hi> retir'd himſelf, after he had ſeen him in bed; but being ignorant of the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100068:76"/>
change of his <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> de Thou, Mayerne, &amp;c.</note>reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſet ſome of his moſt faithful and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute men at all the avenues of the Prince's apartment. It had been to be wiſh'd for the King's juſtification, that Don <hi>Carlos</hi> had been taken in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to eſcape.</p>
            <p>But when they had waited two or three hours, without ſeeing any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of his coming out, the King reſolved to paſs on, not thinking that he ought to hazard all things for a formality. Don <hi>John</hi> had obſerved the manner in which his chamber door was ſhut, and whilſt Don <hi>Carlos</hi> was yet at the Queen's chamber, the King had commanded the maker of that extraordinary Lock, to ſpoil the ſpring of it ſome how or other, that ſo it might no more ſhut ſo cloſe, but that it might be open'd on the outſide. Whatſoever this Workman could do, the ſpring made a great noiſe in opening; but the Count of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100068:76"/>
               <hi>Lerma,</hi> whom the King made enter firſt into the room, found the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Prince ſleeping ſo ſoundly, that he had the leiſure to take away the Swords and Piſtols that were under his bolſter, without waking of him. After this, the Count ſate down upon a Coffer that ſtood by his bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and in which Don <hi>John</hi> thought the Fire-arms were kept. Then the King judging by the Count of <hi>Ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s ſilence, that he had done what he ought to do, entred himſelf into the Chamber, preceded by <hi>Rui Gomez,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> the Great Commander, and Don <hi>Diego de Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duba,</hi> all armed with Swords and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols. The Prince being awakened with much ado by <hi>Rui Gomez,</hi> as ſoon as he had opened his eyes, cried out that he was dead. The King told him, That all they did was for his good. But Don <hi>Carlos</hi> ſeeing that he ſeized on a Box full of Papers, that was under his bed, entred into ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100068:77"/>
a deſpair, that he was going to throw himſelf, all naked as he was, into a great Fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>pan full of Coals, which the extremity of the cold had obliged his ſervants to leave lighted in his chimney. They were fain to draw him from it by force, and he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared inconſolable, that he had not had the time to ſmother himſelf in it. They preſently unfurniſh'd his Chamber, and in ſtead of ſo many magnificent things, which they took out of it, they put into it, for its onely furniture, a ſcurvy Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallet. None of his Officers after that time ever appeared in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. His Guards never let him go out of their ſight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">

This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Heir of ſo many Crowns
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100068:77"/>
ſaw no more any thing about him, which did not repreſent to his eyes the frightful image of death.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the King ſaw the deſigns and intelligence of his Son by the Papers which he had ſeized. He was aſtoniſhed at the greatneſs of the danger he had run; but, he was yet more touched, when amongſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Letters <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mayern</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Spain, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex</hi>'s Hiſtory of <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c.</note>of the Queens Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting he found one, which appeared to him the moſt Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and moſt Amorous in the world. It was that which the Marqueſs of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> had carried to <hi>Alcala,</hi> and which Don <hi>Carlos</hi> would never be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reſtore. As the Queen had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it in the firſt tranſport of her grief, for the Mortal Accident that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen that Prince, ſhe did not think any conſequence could be drawn from what ſhe could ſay to a Man, whoſe life was deſpaired of; or, that it
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100068:78"/>
could produce any other conſequence then to make him die more content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly. So that ſhe had abandon'd her ſelf to all her tenderneſs in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, and had in it expreſſed the deareſt and moſt ſecret Sentiments of her heart, with all the violence that ſo lamentable an occaſion could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire. Yet it was without any Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate expreſſions that could intereſt her honour, or ſo much as offend her Duty.</p>
            <p>But the King drew very different conſequences from it: The fury he conceived for it was at firſt accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with ſo lively a grief, that it would perhaps have bereaved him of his Life, if the deſire of revenge (ſo natural in thoſe occaſions) had not preſerved it.</p>
            <p>But reflecting preſently in himſelf, That he was Maſter of thoſe that had ſo cruelly offended him, this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable thought made a barbarous joy ſucceed to the rage he had in his
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100068:78"/>
Soul, which changed his tormenting deſpair into a tranquility full of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. The ſame day <hi>Monteigni</hi> was clapt in priſon, to leave ſome time after his head upon a ſcaffold, and the Marquis of <hi>Bergh</hi> in favour of <hi>Rui Gomez</hi> his ancient friend had leave to poiſon himſelf. The intimacy of theſe Two Noble-men with Don <hi>Carlos</hi> was known to all the world. They were both, as well as he, declared enemies of the Cardinal <hi>Spinoſa</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor General, and this Enmity was enough in <hi>Spain</hi> to make a man ſuſpected for his Religion. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed this <hi>Prelate</hi> to be the Authour of all thoſe violent Counſels that the King had taken againſt their country, but the Cardinal accuſed them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of having made ſeveral Packets of <hi>Calvin's Catechiſmes</hi> he brought out of <hi>France,</hi> by the help of a <hi>Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> from Don <hi>Carlos.</hi> All the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate proceedings of this Prince, againſt the Inqu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100068:79"/>
of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth were not as yet forgotten. All theſe things joyned together did ſtrangely diſpoſe the people to believe the Innocent Prince engaged in the new opinions, of which he had never ſo much as heard any body ſpeak; The King ſaw well that there was nothing but Religion that could make ſo ſtrange an action, as that he had done be endured. He doubted not but that with theſe favorable diſpoſitions, and the proofs he had of his Son's intelligences, he could, if he would, Sacrifice him with impunity to his revenge. In this belief, he put into the hands of the Cardinal <hi>Spinoſa</hi> all the Originals he had found in Don <hi>Carlos</hi> his Cabinet, excepting onely the Queen's Letters. He eſtabliſhed the Inquiſitors, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Judges between his Son and him; and he proteſted, he would wholly refer himſelf to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He knew that the choler of that ſort of people never dies, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100068:79"/>
that he ſhould find their reſentment againſt the Prince as violent, after ſeveral years of interval ſince their quarrel, as if it had been but a week before.</p>
            <p>Although the King had made ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous prohibitions <note n="*" place="margin">

The moſt part of the Princes of Chriſtendom begg'd his pardon; the Empreſs eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially wrote concerning it to the King her Brother, with all earneſtneſs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. Her eldeſt Daughter had been promiſed a long while before to the Prince of <hi>Spain.</hi> The King, who feared all that might give more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and credit to his Son, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deferred the accompliſhment of this Marriage. Amongſt other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of this delay, he made a report be ſpread, that ſince Don <hi>Carlos</hi> his

This report paſſed for an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the Empreſs her ſelf did in no wiſe believe it. In the mean time, it was ſo much the eaſier to the King to draw this Alliance out into length, becauſe Don <hi>Carlos</hi> did not preſs it ſo much as he might have done. How advantagious ſoever it were for his deſigns, he made a ſcruple of marrying a Princeſs that he could not love. The Empreſs, who knew not the ſecret of his heart, could find but this one Match worthy of her eldeſt Daughter: and not thinking the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi>'s death ſo near as it was, ſhe did not foreſee, that this Daughter was to take the place of that unfortunate Queen, and that the King her Brother, as it were by a kind of fatality, was to marry all the Princeſſes, that had been promiſed to Don <hi>Carlos.</hi> The King, who ſaw fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſhe, took a particular care

He decides, that a King, who diſcovers, that the preſumptive Heir of his Crown will go out of his States, ought to make him be ſtopped by force, if his evaſion can be a ſubject of diviſion in the Kingdom, and that the enemies of the State are in a capacity of drawing any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable uſefulneſs from it; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if thoſe enemies are Hereticks, and that there be the leaſt reaſon to fear or ſuſpect that this Prince favours them.

            <p>The People, in whoſe opinion to be juſtified it is enough to be unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, teſtified every day more and more their Paſſion for the Princes being ſet at Liberty.

juſtifie his Father; yet it is certain that there never came but one thing out of his Mouth that could paſs for a Complaint, which was, that the Queen having by force of Money found the meanes of making him be commanded, on her behalf, to ask leave that he might ſee the King; as one of his Guards came to him, to tell him, That his Father was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Say my King</hi> (anſwered he) <hi>and not my Father.</hi>

            <p>The time of his death is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely known: It is only known, that it arrived a great while before it was publiſhed.

Some time after it was diſcovered, that the Princeſs of <hi>Eboli</hi> had on purpoſe made the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> write thoſe Letters, which ſhe ſaid were intercepted, and which had been ſo fatal to Don <hi>John.</hi> The
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100068:90"/>
