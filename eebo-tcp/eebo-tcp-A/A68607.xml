            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Secondly, it may reproue many who affirme that they haue seene and heard dead men to walke and talke, to frequent their promises, and to say, I am the soule of this man, or of that woman, I am tormented grieuously in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> for this or that which I haue done, I might be deliuered, if so many <hi>Masses</hi> were said for mee.

            <p>Seeing, mans dayes are few, fraile and fickle, few, for

fourescore yeares is a long time now, though foure hundred were not much in time past, fraile, for the strongest man is but weake, and fickle, for we are spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily from the wombe our liuing mothers, to the wombe of our dead mother earth. Mans dayes are not onely few, fraile, and fickle, but short, and so his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing death is changed to an euerlasting life, and the end of a temporall is the beginning of an eternall life. Mans dayes are not onely short, but also full of trouble, notwithstanding the sorrowes of a bitter life shall bee recompenced with a blessed death, and the going out of a bad, is the beginning of a better world. Mans dayes, pompe, glory, birth, blood, are but as vanishing flowers, this world is transitorie, and when man dieth he shall leaue all behind him, hee shall carry no more with him going, then he brought comming: no more out of the world, then hee brought into the world, whereof he shall haue any vse: and when a man is dead he shall returne no more. If a man wrong, or deceiue, oppresse and goe beyond the seas at his returne hee may right those he hath wronged, and relieue those he hath oppressed: but man that wrongeth, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and iniureth in this life, and dieth in the sinne, shall not returne to liue on earth, to repent for it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to satisfie for it, therefore while we liue, let vs so liue, that we may liue in death.</p>
            <p>I haue hitherto spoken of life and death, now I must speake something of the life and death of this <hi>Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Gentleman</hi> whose body standeth before vs ready to be interred.</p>
            <p>To liue well is the ready way to die well, as men liue: so they for the most part die. A blessed life, shall haue a
<pb facs="tcp:15586:18"/>
blessed death. Such as expect for comfort in death, must be obedient to God in life. If men will liue till they be dead, they must die while they liue, a good life here, bringeth a good death hereafter. That his life was godly appeared by his hospitalitie how many of the Saints hath he fed, and lodged, insomuch as if he was a <hi>Gaius</hi> for them, how did he relieue the poore daily at his doores and in time of sicknes how prouident was he for them. He was a peace-maker amonge his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, composing controuersies, and ending many needlesse suites, which either pride, or tyranny, or selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, or enuy had begun. Hee had a great loue to the meanes of his owne saluation, I meane the preaching of the word, frequenting it often if his health did serue him, countenancing &amp; supporting the Lecture where he was a continuall hearer. How kinde and affable hee was to Gods Ministers they will be ready to witnesse. In his sicknesse he was very penitent and sorrowfull, confessed his sinne, desiring God to forgiue him: nay, assuring himselfe that all his sinnes were pardoned and forgiuen for Christs sake. In his sicknesse he was pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, weary of the world, desirous to goe home, forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and forgetting all wrongs and iniuries done him. His talke for the most part in his sicknesse was of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly matters, and such as came to comfort him, might receiue comfort from him. He did often pray, and ioyne in praier, and which was worthy obseruance did pray for a blessing on Phisicke before hee would vse it. He vsed all lawfull meanes commending the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to God. So liued he, and thus died he, leauing an earthly possession, and a house of clay, but now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying an heauenly inheritance, a mansion, a resting
<pb facs="tcp:15586:19"/>
place of eternall glory, leauing louing friends: but now enioying such as are more louely, leauing children, and yet gone to his children. All did not speake well of Christ, some saide hee was a deceiuer, some a glutton, some a wine-bibber, some a company keeper of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men; so all may not speake well of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, there be cursing <hi>Shimeries,</hi> and rayling <hi>Rabshake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,</hi> some that will speake good of <hi>none.</hi> As the red <hi>dragon cast out water after the woman that had brought foorth a man child to drowne it;</hi> so such as are the <hi>dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons</hi> young will cast out slanders, lies, false reports, and cursed speeches after those which die in the Lord to disgrace them. The liues of such men as loue to disgrace the dead we mayknow, their death God knowes.</p>
