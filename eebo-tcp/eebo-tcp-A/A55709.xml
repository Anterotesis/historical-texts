         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OF
ALGEIR:
BEING
A Faithful and True Account
Of the most Considerable
OCCURRENCES
That happened in that Place, during the lying of
the FRENCH FLEET before it.</head>
            <head type="sub">In a Letter from a Gentleman in Algier, to his Friend in London.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Hope mine of the 6th, 11th, and 13th of <hi>Iuly</hi>
are safe Arrived to your hands; in Answer
of your several then Received, to which please
to refer your self, since none of yours appear;
Having some extraordinary Advice of News to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
to you, is the Occasion of this Trouble, which
I shall be glad may prove grateful unto you.</p>
            <p>On the 2d. past Arrived the <hi>Bristol</hi> and <hi>Saphire</hi>
Friggots, from <hi>Leghorn,</hi> (at the same time lying here
about 50 Sayl of <hi>French Frigats,</hi> Gallies and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants)
one of our Boats being sent ashore, was not
Admitted, but a Boat from hence sent to tell them
that they should not come ashore because the <hi>French</hi>
Fleet lay before the Port, and withall, Orders given
that the Consul should not be Admitted to go out
of the Gates; but before the Order Arriv'd the
Mould-gate, he hapned to Run down, and coming to
the head of the Mould beckned to the Boat which
was then Rowing off again, but knowing him, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
and when was within call he told them they
should be gon and stand upon their Guard, for he
was a Prisoner; the Lieutenant of one of the Ships
being in one of the Boats, asked him whether he had
any thing more to say, he Answered, No; whereupon
he went a board, and the Ships stood off to Sea, the
next day stood in again and sent both their boats in,
but the Governour prevented their coming a shore
by ordering three Guns to be fired at them, which
was accordingly done, though at a distance, upon
which they Return'd aboard and the Ships went to
Sea. The boat being the first day Refused coming a
shore, the Consul, went to the Kings House Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing
that if they would not suffer him to go a
board alone, that they would send two or three
<hi>Renegadoes</hi> with him, that could understand what he
said, to avoid the suspicion of his giving any Advice
to the <hi>French,</hi> but was denied; and after being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Reason of his calling so to the Boat, he,
answered them briskly, and being threatned what
damage hapned thereon should fall on his head,
told them he would rather die then one poor <hi>English</hi>
man should be brought in a Slave here, through his
holding his Peace. The Reason of the above Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
(we know) was occasioned by our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
<hi>Rabba Hassan</hi> his coming out of the Camp
disgusted that the Peace with the <hi>English</hi> should have
been made in his absence, and that he had not the
Honour of doing it himself; though his pretence to
the People was onely that if he had been here he
would have done it much more to their Advantage,
adding withal, that the Doors of the Kings house were
shut, and that it was done without the Advice and
Consent of the Souldiery, the meanest whereof ought
to have had his Vote in the doing of it, insinuating
himself thereby into their Favour (which is his
Safeguard) and at once under the Pretence of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogating
and promoting the Publick Interest, and
maintaining their Priviledges, brings his designs
about, by such indirect means promoting many
times his own private Intrest, and at the same time
establishing himself in the Favour, and good
Opinion of the People.</p>
            <p>On the 3d. past the <hi>French</hi> Gallies rowed the
Ships in towards the Mould, the Admiral having
two Gallies a head we were in great Expectation
of some Action, but came all in the Evening to an
Anchor again.</p>
            <p>On the 5th. the Gallies went away; on the 7th
the Ships made all Sayl, some within shot of the
Mould, were Saluted by these People with a great
many Shot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101667:2"/>
On the 11th Ditto a Ketch played some Bombs
upon the Mould, all of them falling short. On the
20th about nine a Clock at Night, the Ketches came
near into the Mould, and continued firing Bombs
till it was almost day, these People Returning Guns
without ceasing, which I suppose were near 1000.
The Bombs the <hi>French</hi> fir'd were above 100. which
broke down 44 houses, and kill'd many People:
Please by the way to Note, that the <hi>French</hi> have five
Ketches with Bombs.</p>
            <p>On the 24th Ditto about eight a Clock at night
appeared a blazing Star in the N. W. Ditto, a little
after the <hi>French</hi> began to play with their Bombs
upon the Town, when these People sent out a Gally
to take one of the Ketches, but was Shamefully
beaten off and forced to return with the loss of some
Christians and <hi>Turks.</hi> This night were beaten down
about six houses, and killed about 35 or 40 Persons;
These People extreamly cast down, seem to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to a Mutiny against their Governour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he ordered <hi>Padre Vacher</hi> to go aboard the
Admiral (with a <hi>Dutch</hi> man of Wars Boat, who now
lies here to clear some of their Captives and is
imployed as an Embassador between the <hi>Turk</hi> and
Devil) to know their demands, though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
only to send the Admiral Word that if he
fired one Gun more against the place he would send
their cheif <hi>Cavallero's,</hi> (that are Captives here) a
board out of the Muzzles of their Guns. Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of People dayly Flocking out to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
for fear of the Bombs crying out with a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Voice, that the World must needs be now at an
end, that never such things as these were seen, that
they certainly were not of mans Invention, but sent
by the Devil from Hell, and that <hi>Algiers</hi> is now
Ruined with many such like Exclamations. <hi>Padre
Vacher</hi> Returning a shore and to the Kings House,
gave them the Admirals Answer, that if they would
send a boat off to morrow with a Flag of Truce he
would treat with them, and that he was sent hither
about his Masters Business and would Prosecute it
to the Destruction of the place: <hi>Padre Vacher</hi> also
begs of the Admiral that he would not fire any
Bombs that night for his sake, for fear they should
take fantasie against him, impute the ill Consequence
to his Advice, and so take Occasion to cut him off;
to which the Admiral would not consent, saying, he
would Willingly do any thing that lay in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for him, but that he could not promise.</p>
            <p>These People as formerly, are ready to mutiny,
to see their houses broken down, and Friends and
Relations killed before their eyes: impute all to the
bad Government. The Governour to avoid the ill
effects of these surmises, and secure His Person, was
willing to do any thing to satisfie them, which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
was the occasion of sending <hi>Padre Vacher; alias</hi>
the <hi>French</hi> Consul aboard, which the Captains of
the Ships and Chief Turks extreamly blame him
for, and are inwardly exceedingly incenst and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
against him, saying, it was a thing contrary
to all reason, giving the <hi>French</hi> the greatest encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
against them, which had it been done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had acted any thing, might have been the
more excusable, but now they had fir'd their Bombs,
shewed abundance of weakness and timerousness in
them, and animated the Enemy to prosecute his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
with the greatest Severity, unless complied
with on dishonourable and disadvantagious Terms.</p>
            <p>The 25th at Night, the French having fir'd a
great many Bombs, but not with that success as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
aiming chiefly at the Mould, which occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
most of them to fall into the water: One took
place in a <hi>Tuniscan</hi> loaden with Wooll, and sent her
to the bottom; another fell into one of their Ships,
broke through both her Decks, and burst in the
Hold, shaking her severely, and two or three Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
broke down it the Town. It is most certain,
these People never met with such a Chastisement as
this, nothing they dread more. But what I thought
almost impossible is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That after their high Looks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and seeming to slight the French so much, they
should with so small a force be brought to send a
Boat aboard the Admiral, which argues their desire
to comply almost on any terms, which if the French
prosecute as they have begun, I am apt to believe
they will obtain.</p>
            <p>I am also credibly informed, that the Admiral
sent word by <hi>Padre Vacher,</hi> That having receiv'd
Advice of a Son born to the Dauphine of <hi>France,</hi> if
the Governour would fire Three Guns in honour
thereof, he would esteem it; and that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
next day ordered the said Guns to be fired, but
the Order was immediately recalled by his Father-in-law,
who is really the Governour, but that his
Son takes it upon him by reason of his Fathers Age,
and Incapacity of Ruling so Rebellious and Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong
a People, who are no longer satisfi'd with
their Governours, than things go before the Wind,
and succeed well, or that he serve for their turn;
but upon the least adversity of Affairs, cut him off,
as they have done others, not past one of fourteen
having onely died his natural Death.</p>
            <p>The first instant the Ketches which used to diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
us with their Fire-works, sailed with two Rere-Admirals,
and several other Ships, so that I believe
the French are breaking up their Rendezvouz in this
Place, and that they do think the Winter too near
at hand to continue longer here; of which more by
the next, God willing. I am in all things,</p>
