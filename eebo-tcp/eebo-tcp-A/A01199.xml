         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YET here reſteth to be told what ſhould

and imprint this treatiſe: certainly two
thinges, firſt for that it was firſt gathered a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
ſet furth in highe Dutche by. D. M. Luther &amp;
after by an other great lerned man tranſlated
out of dutche into latin, &amp; likewiſe imprinted
and ſet fourth after that Friers were bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in Germany. And the ſame cauſe that I
thinke moued them, doth now likewiſe cauſe
me to imprint theſame, which is this, after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
light &amp; knowlege of gods holy word had, ther
is litle perrel to bring furth falſe &amp; erronious
doctrines, for that ſo ſone as they come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light therof they are eſpied &amp; iudged, like
as in the darke though a manne be very well
furniſhed of weapons hable to defend himſelf
<pb facs="tcp:10261:3"/>
from his enemie, yet for lack of light he loſeth
the right vſe of them, for that hee may miſſe
his enemy and hurt his frend, &amp; hauing lighte
and his weapons alſo, hee defendeth himſelf, &amp;
ſaueth his frend and vanquiſheth his enemy.
So now that God hathe geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs the light of
the knowledge of his mooſte holy and ſacred
woord, &amp; hath indued vs with the weapons &amp;
armor of hys holy ſpirite, wee nede not feare
the Deuel our enemye nor his doctrines, but
may boldly loke vpon him in the day light and
ouercome &amp; confound him and al his: &amp; this as
a ſpecial &amp; principal thing ſhal we herby haue

he exceded Ihon. Alſo Frances
is before Ihon for he conuerted
more then Ihon dyd, and hath
trauayled in mo places, that is to
ſaye thorow out all the worlde.
Ihon preached but ij. yeres and
a lytle more, Frances preached
xliij. yeares. Ihon receaued his

Frances receaued yt both of the
Lorde and of the Pope, whiche
<pb facs="tcp:10261:16"/>
is more. Ihon what maner of
perſon he ſhould be was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of an Angell to his father,
and by the holy ghoſt was made
knowen to the Prophetes. But
Frances was declared by the
Prophetes, by our Lorde Ieſu
Chriſt, and by an Angell in the
likenes of a pilgrim, both to his
Father and Mother and whole
houſhold. S. Ihon prophecied
bothe in his Mothers belye and

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> frende of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpouſe, but Frances
was made like vnto Chriſt him
ſelfe. Ihon to the worlde was
very holy: But Frances excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

he fell doune at the fete of Chriſt,
whiche he put foorth for him to
<pb facs="tcp:10261:45"/>
kiſſe, whiche he waſſhed with the

him, but after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he preached moſt
profound diuinitie, his hart bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
an .C. times more, then if it
had bene in a burning Fornace,
and for extreme heat he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to crie out and make excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.
He was once rapte of
God aboue al creatures, and his
ſoule was ſwalowed vp in the
depenes of diuinitie, and was bu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ried
in the Sea of infinite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of the godhed, inſomuch that
nothing created, nothing made,
nor imagined, nothing thoughte,
<pb facs="tcp:10261:46"/>
nor comprehended, whiche either
hart could think, or tonge coulde
ſpeake, but it was knowen and
reueled vnto him, ſo that his ſoul
was ouerwhelmed, as is a drop
of wine in the ſea, and he ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but god in all thinges and
aboue all thinges, and without
al thinges, and there he ſawe iii.

thus beyng in his meditacion, &amp;
in wailing and weping he came

&amp; prayed that he myght ſe
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> viſion once agayn, and that he

Wherfore on a tyme in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

knoweſt thou not that ſlepe

To what purpoſe doeſt thou bete
thy ſelf thus? And bleſſed Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ymedyatly put of all his clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes
and his breches and ſtriped
him ſelf ſtark naked, and he went
out of his Cel &amp; paſſed thorough
a great rough hedge and entred
into a great wyldernes whiche
was very thorny, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his body
was all bloody: then ſayd he to
him ſelf, yt is a great deale better
that I ſhould thus knowlege y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
paſſion of our Lord Ieſu Chriſt,
then obeye vnto deceitfull flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terynges.
And ſodeynly there
was in the wyldernes a great
light, which appered to be wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
full of gelyfloures and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
&amp; there was an innumerable
<pb facs="tcp:10261:78"/>

with one voyce, Bleſſed Frances
come hether quyckly, The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyour

Church and tary for the. Then
bleſſed Frances ſawe him ſelfe
newly appareled, but howe or

could not tell. And there appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

tooke out of the roſary, xij. red

To whome Chriſt aunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered,
I will that yt be theſame
daye in the whiche bleſſed Peter
was deliuered from his bondes,
begynnyng at the firſt euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſong

folowyng, includyng the nyght,
and that whoſoeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the day of his entraunce into the
Churche of our Lady Porcyun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule,
how greuous or great ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
their ſynnes be. And bleſſed
Frances ſayde, Mooſt holyeſt
Father, how may this be knowen
to mankynde that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue?
And our Lorde ſayde, that
ſhall God proſpere and help tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
his Fauoure and Grace.
Notwithſtandyng thou ſhalt go
vnto Rome to my Vyker whome
I haue ordeyned and appoynted
&amp; to whome I haue geuen power
to bynde and loſe, &amp; wyll him to
publiſhe &amp; declare this pardon
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> aſmuche expedicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he ſhall
thynk mete. Then ſayde bleſſed
Frances, but how ſhall thy Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
credyt me, paraduenture he
wyll not beleue me wretched ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
The Lorde ſayd to him, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:10261:80"/>
Frances, take with the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyn
of thy brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for wytneſſes
thewhich hear all theſe thynges,
&amp; alſo take with the theſe red and
whyte roſes which y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> gathered eſt
in the moneth of Ianuarij when
thou waſt poniſhing of thy body
in the wyldernes. All theſe
thynges were hearde by Freer
Peter of Cathany, Angell of
Reato, Ruffine Sophy, Freer
Maſſey, &amp;c. Then bleſſed ſaynct
Frances tooke of the roſes that
he brought iij. red and iij. whyte,
in the honoure of the moſt holy
and indiuiſible trinite, and to the
praiſe of god &amp; our bleſſed Lady.
And then the Angelles ſong with
lowd and great voyce, <hi>Te deum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mornyng bleſſed Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
tooke his felowes, ſaiyng to
theim, let vs go to Rome, and he
<pb facs="tcp:10261:80"/>
commaunded theim to kepe all
theſe thynges ſecret. And
when he entred into Rome, he
tooke his way toward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church
of Saynct Iohn Lateranence,
and there he found Pope Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
the ſucceſſor of Innocent,
and the Viker of oure Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu
Chriſt. To whome S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
on the behalf of our Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
all the thynges aforſayde,
&amp; of theſame bare wytnes thefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd
brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and the roſes aboue
mencioned. And Pope Honori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
beholdyng in the moneth of
Ianuarij roſes ſo freſhe, and
hauyng ſo quyck a ſauour and
colour, ſayd, this is ſuerly a great
myracle, and muſt come rather
of God then of man, &amp; we knowe
that their teſtimony is true. Then
the Pope co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:10261:81"/>
and his felowes ſhould haue
wherwith to refreſhe theim ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.
The next daye after, bleſſed
Frances came agayn to the pope
ſaiyng: Moſt worthy Vyker of
Chriſt, fullfill about the matter
aforſayd, the wyll of the kynge
of heauen and his Mother. And
beyng aſked agayne in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Cardinalles what he
deſyred. And when he aunſwered
the forſayd pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be at Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
or the day that ſaynt Peter
was loſed out of his bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des. The
Pope aunſwered, Frances, that
which thou deſireſt is very great,
but foraſmuche as the kynge of
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the inſtaunce of the moſt
bleſſed Virgyn his Mother hath

Tuderino, Spolitano,
<pb facs="tcp:10261:81"/>
Fulginati, Nucerino and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gubino,
that they ſhall aſſemble
together at the Churche of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuncule

and there they ſhall declare the

deſyre to haue yt. And ſo bleſſed
Frances and his felowes recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes letters &amp; departed.
And bleſſed Frances ſayde vnto
the Byſſhopes, which of you will
publiſhe and declare this pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
When the Biſſhopes were all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
at the daye appoynted,
bleſſed Frances ſayd vnto theim,
yf yt pleaſe you, though I be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
I wyll ſaye ſomewhat in

you are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded by the Pope

bleſſed Frances preached ſo ſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
