            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The following Diſcourſe (as is eaſily perceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by divers Paſſages thereof) being written, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years ſince, whole and entire, as now it is, I know not whether it will be worth while to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, that the <hi>Author,</hi> caſually turning over of late a very recent <hi>Chymical Writer,</hi> found in one of his Treatiſes (divers of which he never to this day read over) a part of the <hi>Fifth Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94784:4"/>
of the ſecond Section; but, as He profeſſes, (and ſure is like to be believed, ſhe did not dream that That <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> or any other Author what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever had lighted on that part of the <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> till a good while after he had made and examined That, among many others, concerning <hi>Salts,</hi> as may be eaſily gueſs'd by the peculiar uſes and applications He made of it. And though He had met with ſo unlikely an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a Writer, who, whether he deſerve it or no, has the ill fortune to be much accuſ'd of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity, and ſome of whoſe more eaſie proceſſes our Author (who yet is willing to ſpare his Name, and ſeems to think his works not uſeleſs) could not find to ſucceed, He ſhould not have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it upon his <hi>Authority,</hi> no more then he is wont to take other <hi>Proceſſes,</hi> divers of which He yet in the general ſuppoſes may be true upon the relation of other Chymiſts; who by blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Books by things untrue and juſtly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious, are not to be relyed on, nor much thanked by wary men. But twill probably appear leſſe pertinent to adde any thing further on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, then to take notice, that when the <hi>Author</hi> had once conſented to the Publication of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Papers,</hi> He ſeveral times wiſhd for an Opportunity to make the <hi>Experiments</hi> and <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,</hi> He now preſents to the <hi>Publick,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94784:4"/>
more full and compleat, then they were when ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd to a private <hi>Friend.</hi> But the <hi>Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that drove him from the Places, where his Accommodations for repeating Experiments were, oblig'd Him to apply Himſelf to other <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> and <hi>Employments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And upon the ſame account, though he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found many of his <hi>Notes</hi> upon other parts of the Eſsay of <hi>Salt-petre,</hi> and have lying by him divers <hi>Papers</hi> concerning <hi>Senſible Qualities,</hi> and <hi>Senſation in general,</hi> and the <hi>Production of Second Qualities,</hi> together with a collection of <hi>Notes about Occult Qualities,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subjects of kin to thoſe of this <hi>Book;</hi> yet having, upon the freſhly intimated Occaſion, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted his Thoughts to other Subjects, He will not engage himſelf to put together and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his Collections on theſe Subjects by any Publick promiſe.</p>
            <p>Onely thus much perchance I may undertake for, if a fair Opportunity offer it ſelf, that the Author may be induc'd to adde ere long, for the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this preſent Work, a <hi>Diſcourſe of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THe Origine <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> and Nature of the Qualities of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, is a Subject, that I have long lookt upon, as one of the moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and Uſefull that the Naturaliſt can pitch upon for his Contemplation. For the Knowledge we have of the Bodies without Us, being for the Moſt part fetched from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations the Mind receives by the Senſes, we ſcarce know any thing elſe in Bodies, upon whoſe account they can worke upon our Senſes ſave their Qualities: For as to the Subſtantial Formes, which ſome Imagine to be in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Bodies, it is not halfe ſo Evident, that there are ſuch, as it is, that the wiſeſt of thoſe that do admit them, Confeſſe, that they do not well Know them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Nego tibi ullam eſſe formam robis notam ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> And as tis by their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, that Bodies act Immediately upon our
<pb facs="tcp:94784:7"/>
Senſes, ſo 'tis by vertue of thoſe Attributes likewiſe, that they act upon Other bodies, &amp; by that action produce in Them, &amp; oftentimes in Themſelves thoſe Changes, that ſometimes we call Alterations, and ſometimes Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Corruption.</p>
            <p>And 'tis chiefly by the Knowledge, ſuch as it is, that Experience, (not Art) hath taught Us, of theſe differing Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Bodies, that we are enabled, by a due application of Agents to Patients, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the little Empire, that we have either Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd or Regain'd over the Creatures. But <hi>I</hi> think not the contemplation of Qualities more Noble &amp; Uſeful, then I find it Difficult; For what is wont to be taught us of Qualities in the Schools, is ſo Slight and ill grounded, that it may be doubted, whether they have not rather Obſcured, then Illuſtrated the things they ſhould have explain'd. And I was quickly diſcouraged from expecting to learne much from them, of the Nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> divers Particular Qualities, when I found that except ſome few, which they tell You i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:94784:7"/>
General may be deduced, (by wayes they leave thoſe to gueſſe at that can,) from thoſe foure Qualities, they are pleas'd to call the Firſt; they confeſſe, that the reſt ſpring from thoſe Forms of Bodies, whoſe particular Natures, the judiciouſeſt of them acknowledge, they cannot comprehend. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not only doth (as we ſhall ſee anon) give us of Qualitie in Generall, (which yet ſeems far more eaſily defineable, then many a Particular Quality,) no other then ſuch a definition, as is as Obſcure, as the thing to be declared by it; but I Obſerve not without ſome wonder, that in his eight Books of <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> where he profeſsedly treats of the Generall Affections of Naturall things, he leaves out the Doctrine of Qualities; as after him <hi>Magirus,</hi> and divers other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Peripatetick Phyſiologie have done: which (by the way) I cannot but look upon as an Omiſsion, ſince Qualities doe as well ſeem to belong to Naturall Bodies Generally conſider'd, as Place, Time, Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thoſe other things, which upon that
<pb facs="tcp:94784:8"/>
account are wont to be Treated of in the Generall part of Natural Philoſophy. The moſt Ingenious <hi>Des Cartes</hi> has ſomething concerning ſome Qualities; but though for Reaſons elſewhere expreſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely Forborn to peruſe his Syſteme of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy; yet I find by Turning over the Leaves that he has Left moſt of the other Qualities <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntreated of, &amp; of Thoſe, that are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call'd Senſible, he Speaks but very Briefly &amp; Generally; rather conſidering what they do upon the Organs of Senſe, then what Changes happen in the Objects themſelves, to make them Cauſe in us a Perception ſometimes of one Quality, and ſometimes of Another. Beſides, that his Explications, do many of them ſo depend upon His pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Notions, (of a <hi>Materia Subtilis, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli Secundi Elementi,</hi> and the like) and Theſe as it became ſo Great a Perſon, he has ſo Interwoven with the reſt of his Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, that They can ſeldome be made <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of without Adopting his whole Philoſophy <hi>Epicurus</hi> indeed, and his Scholiaſt <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94784:8"/>
have Given ſome good Hints concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Nature of ſome few Qualities. But beſide, that even theſe Explications are divers of them either Doubtfull or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, or both, there are many other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which are left for Others to Treat of. And this is the Second and Maine Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which I find in inveſtigating the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Qualities, Namely, that Whatever be to be thought of the Generall Theoryes of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or other Philoſophers, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Qualities; we evidently Want That, upon which a Theory, to be Solid and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefull, muſt be Built; I mean an Experimentall Hiſtory of them. And this we ſo Want, that except perhaps what Mathematicians have done concerning Sounds, and the Obſervations (rather then Experiments) that our Illuſtrious <hi>Verulam</hi> hath (in ſome few Pages) ſay'd of Heat, in his ſhort <hi>Eſſay, De Formâ Calidi;</hi> I know not Any one Quality, of which any Author has yet Given us an any thing competent Hiſtory. Theſe things I mention to You, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> not
<pb facs="tcp:94784:9"/>
at all to derogate from thoſe Great Men; whoſe deſign ſeems rather to have been to deliver Principles and Summaries of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, then to inſiſt upon Particulars; but for this purpoſe, that ſince the Nature of Qualities is ſo <hi>beneficiall</hi> a ſpeculation, my labours may not be look'd upon as wholly Uſeleſſe, though I can contribute but a little to the clearing of it: and that ſince 'tis ſo <hi>abſtruſe</hi> a ſubject, I may be pardon'd, if I ſometimes miſse the marke, and leave diverſe things uncompleated; That being but what ſuch great Philoſophers have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mee.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Pyrophylus,</hi> before I proceed to give You my Notes upon this part of our Author's Eſſay, that you may rightly underſtand my Intention in them, it will be requiſite to give you three or foure Advertiſements.</p>
            <p>And firſt, when ever I ſhall ſpeake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely of Subſtantiall forms, I would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be underſtood to except the Reaſonable Soule, that is ſaid to inform the humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; which Declaration I here deſire may be
<pb facs="tcp:94784:9"/>
taken notice of, once for all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Nor am I willing to treat of the Origine of Qualities in beaſts; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not be engaged to examine, of what Nature their Soules are, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is difficult in moſt caſes, (at leaſt for one, that is compaſſionate enough,) either to make experiments upon Living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, or to judg what influence their Life may have, upon the change of Qualities, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by ſuch Experiments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The occaſion of the following Reflections, being onely this; that our Author in that part of his Eſſay concerning Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter, whereto theſe Notes referre, does briefly Intimate ſome Notions about the Nature and Origine of Qualities; You muſt not exſpect, that I, whoſe Method leads me but to Write ſome Notes upon this, and ſome other parts of this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> ſhould make Solemne or Elaborate diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes concerning the Nature of particular Qualities, and that I ſhould fully deliver my own apprehenſions concerning thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:94784:10"/>
Subjects. For as I elſewhere ſufficiently Intimate, that in theſe firſt Notes I Write as a <hi>Corpuſcularian,</hi> &amp; ſet down thoſe Things onely, that ſeem to have a tendency to Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate or Countenance the Notions or Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies imply'd in our Author's <hi>Eſſay:</hi> So I muſt here Tell you, that I neither have now the Leaſure, nor Pretend to the Skill, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Fully the Hiſtory or to Explicate Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Nature of Each ſeveral Quality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> But I conſider, that the Schools have of late much Amus'd the World, with a way they have got, of Referring all Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Effects to certain Entities, that they call <hi>Reall Qualities,</hi> and accordingly Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to them a Nature diſtinct from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of the Matter they belong to, &amp; in ſome caſes Separable from all Matter what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, by which Meanes they have, as farre forth as their Doctrine is Acquieſc'd in, made it thought Needleſſe or Hopeleſs for men to Employ their Induſtry, in ſearching into the Nature of Particular Qualities, &amp; their Effects. As if, (for Inſtance) it be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb facs="tcp:94784:10"/>
how Snow comes to dazle the Eyes, they will anſwer, that 'tis by a <hi>Quality</hi> of Whiteneſs that is in It; which makes all very white Bodies produce the ſame Effect; And if You, ask what this Whiteneſs is, They will tell you no more in ſubſtance, then that tis a <hi>reall Entity,</hi> which denominates the Parcel of Matter, to which it is Joyn'd, White; &amp; if You further Enquire, what this real Entity, which They call a Quality, is, You will find, as Wee ſhall ſee anon, that They either Speak of it much after the ſame rate, that They do of their Subſtantiall Forms; (as indeed ſome of the Modern'ſt teach, That a Quality af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Matter it belongs to, <hi>per modum formae ſecundariae,</hi> as they ſpeak) or at leaſt they will not Explicate it more Intelligibly.</p>
            <p>And accordingly if you further Ask them, how white Bodies in Generall do rather Produce this effect of dazling the Eyes, then Green or Blew ones, inſtead of being told, that the former ſort of Bodies reflect Outwards, and ſo to the Eye farre more of the Incident Light, then the Latter; You ſhall perchance
<pb facs="tcp:94784:11"/>
be told, that 'tis their reſpective Natures ſo to act, by which way of diſpatching difficulties, they make it very <hi>eaſy</hi> to ſolve All the Phoenomena of Nature in Generall, but make men think it <hi>impoſſible</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate almoſt Any of them in Particular.</p>
            <p>And though the Unſatisfactoriſneſs and Barrenneſſe of the School. Philoſophy have perſwaded a great many Learned Men, eſpecially Phyſicians, to ſubſtitute the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts Three principles, inſtead of thoſe of the Schools; and though I have a very good opinion of Chymiſtry it ſelf, as 'tis a Practical Art; yet as 'tis by Chymiſts pretended to containe a Syſteme of Theori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Principles of Philoſophy, I fear it will afford but very little ſatisfaction to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere enquirer, into the Nature of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For beſides that, as we ſhall more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſee anon, there are Many Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which cannot with any probability be deduc'd from Any of the three Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; thoſe that are aſcrib'd to One, or other of them, cannot Intelligibly be explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="tcp:94784:11"/>
without recourſe to the more Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Principles of the Corpuſcularian Philoſophy. To tell us, for inſtance, that all Solidity proceeds from Salt, onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming us, (where it can plauſibly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) <hi>in what</hi> materiall principle or <hi>ingredient</hi> that Quality <hi>reſides,</hi> not <hi>how</hi> it is <hi>produced;</hi> for this doth not teach us, (for example) <hi>how</hi> Water even in exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clos'd veſsels comes to be frozen into Ice; that is, turn'd from a fluid to a Solid Body, without the acceſſion of a ſaline ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent (which I have not yet found pretended, eſpecially Glaſſe being held Impervious to Salts.) Wherefore, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I thought it might much conduce to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Nature of Qualities, To ſhew how they are Generated; and by the ſame way, I hop'd it might remove in ſome meaſure the obſtacle, that theſe Dark and Narrow Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Peripateticks and Chymiſts may prove to the Advancement of ſolid and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Philoſophy. That then, which I chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly aime at, is to make it Probable to you by
<pb facs="tcp:94784:12"/>
Experiments, (which I Think hath not yet beene done:) That allmoſt all ſorts of Qualities, moſt of which have been by the Schooles either left Unexplicated, or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally referr'd, to I know not what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Subſtantiall Formes; <hi>may</hi> be produced Mechanically, I mean by ſuch Corporeall Agents, as do not appear, either to Work otherwiſe, then by vertue of the Motion, Size, Figure, and Contrivance of their own Parts, (which Attributes I call the Mechanicall Affections of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe to Them men willingly Referre the various Operations of Mechanical En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines:) or to Produce the new Qualities exhibited by thoſe Bodies their Action changes, by any other way, then by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the <hi>Texture,</hi> or <hi>Motion,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Mechanical Affection</hi> of the Body wrought upon. And this if I can in any Paſſable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure do, though but in a generall way, in ſome or other of each of theſe Three Sorts, into which the Peripateticks are wont to Divide the Qualities of Bodies, I hope I ſhall have
<pb facs="tcp:94784:12"/>
done no uſeleſſe Piece of Service to Natural Philoſophy, <hi>Partly</hi> by exciting You, and Your Learned Friends, to Enquire after more Intelligible and Satisfactory wayes of explicating Qualities, and <hi>Partly</hi> by <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> ſuch a Collection of Materials to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of thoſe Qualities, that I ſhall the moſt largely Inſiſt on, as Heat, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, Fluidity and Firmneſſe, as may invite You, and other Ingenious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en, to contribute alſo their Experiments, and Obſervations to ſo Uſefull a VVork, and thereby lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, whereon You, and perhaps I, may ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtruct a more Diſtinct and Explicite Theory of Qualities, then I ſhall at preſent adventure at. And though I Know, that ſome of the things my Experiments tend to Manifeſt, may likewiſe be Confirm'd by the more obvious Phaenomena of Nature, yet I Praeſume You will not diſlike my Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to entertaine You with the Former, (though without at all Deſpiſing, or ſo much as ſtrictly forbearing to Employ the Latter,) becauſe the Changes of Qualities made by
<pb facs="tcp:94784:13"/>
Our Experiments will for the moſt part be more Quick &amp; Conſpicuous, and the agents made uſe of to produce them, being of our own Applying, and oftentimes of our own Praeparation, we may be thereby aſſiſted the better to judge of what they Are, and to make an aeſtimate of what 'tis they Do.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94784:14"/>
and here, at the Entrance, give you (in a general way) a brief Account of the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> it ſelfe, as it concernes the Origine of Qualities (and Forms:) and for Diſtinctions ſake, I ſhall comprize it in the Eight following Particulars, which, that the whole Scheme may be the better Comprehended, and as it were Survey'd under one Proſpect, I ſhall do little more then Barely propoſe <hi>Them,</hi> that either ſeem evident enough by their owne Light, or may without Praejudice have diverſe of their Proofes reſerv'd for proper places in the following part of this Treatiſe: and though there be ſome <hi>Other</hi> Particulars, to which the Importance of the Subjects, and the Greatneſſe of the (almoſt Univerſall) Prejudices, that lye againſt them, vvill oblige mee Immediately to annexe (for the ſeaſonable Clearing, and Juſtifying of them) ſome Annotations: yet that they may, as Little as I can, Obſcure the Cohaerence of the vvhole Diſcourſe, as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94784:14"/>
much of them as conveniently may be, ſhall be included in [ ] Paratheſes.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I agree with the generality of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſo far, as to allow, that there is one Catholick or Univerſal Matter common to all Bodies, by which I mean a Subſtance extended, diviſible and impenetrable.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But becauſe this Matter being in its own Nature but one, the diverſity we ſee in Bodies muſt neceſſarily ariſe from ſomewhat elſe, then the Matter they conſiſt of. And ſince we ſee not, how there could be any change in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if all its (actual or deſignable) parts were perpetually at reſt among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it will follow, that to diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Catholick Matter into variety of Natural Bodies, it muſt have Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſome or all its deſignable Parts: and that Motion muſt have various tendencies, that which is in this part of the Matter tending one way, and that which is in that part tending another;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94784:15"/>
as we plainly ſee in the Univerſe or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Maſs of Matter there is really a great quantity of Motion, and that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly determin'd, and that yet diverſe portions of Matter are at reſt.</p>
            <p>That there is Local Motion in many parts of Matter is manifeſt to ſenſe, but how Matter came by this Motion was of Old, and is ſtill hotly diſputed of: for the antient Corpuſcularian Philoſophers, (whoſe doctrine in moſt other points, though not in all, we are the moſt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to,) not acknowledging an Author of the Univerſe, were thereby reduc'd to make Motion congenite to Matter, and conſequently coëval with it; but ſince Local Motion, or an Endeavour at it, is not included in the nature of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is as much Matter, when it reſts, as when it moves; and ſince we ſee, that the ſame portion of Matter may from Motion be reduc'd to Reſt, and after it hath continu'd at Reſt, as long as other Bodies doe not put it out
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94784:15"/>
of that ſtate, may by external Agents be ſet a moving again; I, who am not wont to think a man the worſe Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt for not being an Atheiſt, ſhall not ſcruple to ſay with an Eminent Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher of Old, whom I find to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd among the Greeks that Opinion (for the main) that the Excellent <hi>Des Cartes</hi> hath revived amongſt Us, That the Origine of Motion in Matter is from God; and not onely ſo, but that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it very unfit to be believ'd, that Matter barely put into Motion, and then left to it ſelf, ſhould Caſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute this beautiful and orderly World: I think alſo further, that the wiſe Author of Things did by eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laws of Motion among Bodies, and by guiding the firſt Motions of the ſmall parts of Matter, bring them to convene after the manner requiſite to compoſe the World, and eſpecially did contrive thoſe curious and elaborate Engines, the bodies of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94784:16"/>
endowing moſt of them with a power of propagating their Species. But though theſe things are my Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet becauſe they are not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be ſuppoſ'd here, where I doe not pretend to deliver any compleat Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Principles of Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophy, but onely to touch upon ſuch Notions, as are requiſite to explicate the Origine of Qualities and Forms, I ſhall paſs on to what remains, as ſoon as I have taken notice, that <hi>Local Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems to be indeed the Principl a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Second Cauſes, and the Grand A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of all that happens in Nature:</hi> For though Bulk, Figure, Reſt, Situation, and Texture do concurre to the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> of Nature, yet in compariſon of Motion they ſeem to be in many Caſes, Effects, and in many others, little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Conditions,</hi> or <hi>Requiſites,</hi> or Cauſes <hi>ſine quibus non,</hi> which modifie the operation, that one part of Matter by vertue of its Motion hath upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94784:16"/>
as in a Watch, the number, the figure, and coaptation of the Wheels and other parts is requiſite to the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hour, and doing the other things that may be perform'd by the Watch; but till theſe parts be actually put into Motion, all their other affections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine inefficacious: and ſo in a Key, though if it were too big, or too little, or if its Shape were incongruous to that of the cavity of the Lock, it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be uſ'd as a Key, though it were put into Motion; yet let its bigneſs and figure be never ſo fit, unleſs actual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion intervene, it will never lock or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock any thing, as without the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Motion, neither a Knife nor Raſor will actually cut, how much ſoever their ſhape &amp; other Qualities may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">III. Theſe two grand and moſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Principles of Bodies, Matter, and Motion, being thus eſtabliſh'd, it will follow both, that Matter muſt be actually divided into Parts, that being the genuine Effect of variouſly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd Motion, and that each of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Fragments, or other diſtinct and entire Maſſes of Matter muſt have two Attributes, its own Magnitude, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Size,</hi> and its own <hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>Shape.</hi> And ſince Experience ſhews us (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that which is afforded us by Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Operations, in many of which Matter is divided into Parts, too ſmall to be ſingly ſenſible,) that this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Matter is frequently made into inſenſible Corpuſcles or Particles, we may conclude, that the minuteſt frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as the biggeſt Maſſes of the Univerſal Matter are likewiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed each with its peculiar Bulk and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94784:17"/>
Shape. For being a finite Body, its Dimenſions muſt be terminated and meaſurable: and though it may change its Figure, yet for the ſame reaſon it muſt neceſſarily have <hi>ſome Figure</hi> or other. So that now we have found out, and muſt admit three Eſſential Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of each entire or undivided, though inſenſible part of Matter, namely, <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,</hi> (by which I mean not quantity in general, but a determin'd quantity, which we in Engliſh oftentimes call the <hi>Size</hi> of a bodie,) <hi>Shape,</hi> and either <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Reſt,</hi> (for betwixt them two there is no mean:) the two firſt of which may be called <hi>inſeparable Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> of each diſtinct part of Matter: <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable,</hi> becauſe being extended, and yet finite, it is Phyſically impoſſible, that it ſhould be devoid of ſome Bulk or other, and ſom determinate Shape or other; and yet <hi>Accidents,</hi> becauſe that whether or no the Shape can by Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Agents be alter'd or the Body ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94784:18"/>
yet mentally both the one and the other may be done, the whole eſſence of Matter remaining undeſtroy'd.</p>
            <p>Whether theſe Accidents may not conveniently enough be call'd the Moods or primary affections of Bodies, to diſtinguiſh them from thoſe leſſe ſimple Qualities, (as Colours, Taſtes, and Odours,) that belong to Bodies u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their account, or whether with the Epicureans they may not be called the Conjuncts of the ſmalleſt parts of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall not now ſtay to conſider, but one thing the Modern Schools are wont to teach concerning Accidents, which is too repugnant to our preſent Doctrine, to be in this place quite omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, namely that there are in Natural Bodies ſtore of <hi>real Qualities,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>real Accidents,</hi> which not onely are no Moods of Matter, but are real Entities diſtinct from it, and according to the doctrine of many modern Schoolmen may <hi>exiſt ſeparate</hi> from all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94784:18"/>
Matter whatſoever. To clear this point a little, we muſt take notice, that <hi>Accident</hi> is among Logicians and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers uſ'd in two ſeveral ſenſes, for ſometimes it is oppoſ'd to the 4th Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicable, (<hi>Property,</hi>) and is then defin'd, "that which may be preſent or abſent, without the deſtruction of the ſubject; as a Man may be ſick or well, and a Wall white or not white, and yet the one be ſtill a Man, the other a Wall; and this is call'd in the Schools <hi>Accidens praedicabile,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from what they call <hi>Accidens praedicamentale,</hi> which is oppoſ'd to Subſtance: for when things are divided by Logicians into 10 Praedicaments, or higheſt genus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es of things, Subſtance making one of them, all the nine other are of Accidents. And as Subſtance is commonly defin'd to be a thing that ſubſiſts of it ſelf, and is the ſubject of Accidents, (or more plainly, a real Entity or thing, that needs not any (<hi>created</hi>) Being, that it may exiſt:)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94784:19"/>

And becauſe Logicians make it the diſcriminating note of Subſtance, and Accident, that the former is a thing that cannot be in another, as in its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Inhaeſion, tis requiſite to know, that according to them, That is ſaid to <hi>Be in a Subject,</hi> which hath theſe three conditions, That however it (1) <hi>be in another thing,</hi> (2) <hi>is not in it as a part,</hi> and (3) <hi>cannot exiſt ſeparately</hi> from the thing or ſubject, wherein it is: as a white Wall is the ſubject of Inhaeſion of the Whiteneſs we ſee in it, which ſelf-ſame whiteneſs though it be not in the wall as a part of it, yet cannot the ſelf-ſame whiteneſs according to our Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94784:19"/>
exiſt any where out of the wall, though many other Bodies may have the like degree of whiteneſs. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſ'd, twill not be hard to diſcover the falſity of the lately mentioned Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick opinion touching real Qualities and Accidents, their doctrine about which does, I confeſs, appear to me to be either unintelligible, or manifeſtly contradictious: for ſpeaking in a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſenſe, if they will not allow theſe Accidents to be Modes of Matter, but Entities really diſtinct from it, and in ſome caſes ſeparable from all Matter, they make them indeed Accidents in name, but repreſent them under ſuch a notion as belongs onely to Subſtances; the nature of a Subſtance conſiſting in this, That it can ſubſiſt of it ſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being in any thing elſe, as in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Inhaeſion: ſo that to tell us, that a Quality, or other Accident may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without a ſubject, is indeed, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they pleaſe to call it, to allow it the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94784:20"/>
true Nature of Subſtance, nor will their Groundleſſe Diſtinctions do any more then keep them from ſeeming to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict themſelves in words, whilſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepoſſeſs'd perſons ſee that they do it in effect. Nor could I ever find it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly made out, what theſe real Qualities may be, that they deny to be either Matter or modes of Matter, or immaterial Subſtances. When a Bowl runs along or lies ſtill, that <hi>Motion</hi> or <hi>Reſt,</hi> or <hi>Globous figure</hi> of the Bowl, is not <hi>Nothing,</hi> and yet it is not any <hi>part</hi> of the Bowl; whoſe whole Subſtance would remain, though it wanted which you pleaſe of theſe Accidents: and to make them <hi>real</hi> and <hi>phyſical</hi> Entities, (for we have not here to do either with <hi>Logical</hi> or <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> ones) is, as if, becauſe we may conſider the ſame Man ſitting, ſtanding, running, thirſty, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, wearie, &amp;c. we ſhould make each of theſe a diſtinct Entitie, as we do give ſome of them (as hunger, wearineſs, &amp;c.)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94784:20"/>
diſtinct names. Whereas the ſubject of all theſe Qualities is but the ſame Man as he is conſidered with Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that make him appear different in one caſe from what he appears in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: And it may be very uſeful to our preſent Scope to obſerve, that not onely diverſity of <hi>Names,</hi> but even di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Definitions,</hi> doth not alwaies infer a diverſity of <hi>Phyſical Entities</hi> in the Subject, whereunto they are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted. For it happens in many of the Phyſical Attributes of a Body, as in thoſe Other caſes, wherein a Man that is a Father, a Husband, a Maſter, a Prince, &amp;c. may have a Peculiar Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition (ſuch as the Nature of the thing will bear) belong unto him in each of theſe Capacities, and yet the Man in himſelf conſidered is but the ſame Man, who in reſpect of differing Capacities or Relations to other things is call'd by differing Names, and deſcrib'd by vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Definitions, which yet (as I was

               </head>
               <p>BUt becauſe I take this Notion to be of no Small Importance towards the Avoiding of the Grand Miſtake, that hath hitherto obtain'd about the Nature of Qualities, it will be worth while to Illuſtrate it a little farther. We may conſider then, that when <hi>Tubal-Cain,</hi> or whoever elſe were the Smith, that Invented <hi>Locks</hi> and <hi>Keyes,</hi> had made his firſt Lock, (for we may Reaſonably ſuppoſe him to have made that before the <hi>Key,</hi> though the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94784:21"/>
may be made uſe of without that Suppoſition,) That was onely a Piece of Iron, contriv'd into ſuch a Shape; and when afterwards he made a Key to that Lock, That alſo in it ſelf Conſider'd, was nothing but a Piece of Iron of ſuch a Determinate Figure: but in Regard that theſe two Pieces of Iron might now be Applied to one another after a Certain manner, and that there was a Congruitie betwixt the Wards of the Lock and thoſe of the Key, the Lock and the Key did each of them now Obtain a new Capacity and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Main part of the Notion and Deſcription of a Lock, that it was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being made to Lock or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock by that other Piece of Iron we call a Key, and it was Lookd upon as a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Faculty and Power in the Key, that it was Fitted to Open and Shut the Lock, and yet by theſe new Attributes there was not added any Real or Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Entity, either to the Lock, or to the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94784:22"/>
Key, each of them remaining indeed nothing, but the ſame Piece of Iron, juſt ſo Shap'd as it was before. And when our Smith made other Keyes of differing Bigneſſes, or with Differing Wards, though the firſt Lock was not to be open'd by any of thoſe Keyes, yet that Indiſpoſition, however it might be Conſider'd as a peculiar Power of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting this or that Key, and might ſerve to Diſcriminate it ſufficiently from the Locks thoſe Keyes belong'd to, was nothing new in the Lock, or diſtinct from the Figure it had before thoſe Keyes were made. To carrie this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon a little Further, let me adde, that though one that would have De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd the Firſt Lock, and the Firſt Key, would have Given them diſtinct Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions with Reference to each other; and yet (as I was ſaying) theſe Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being given but upon the Score o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

infer, that theſe two Iron Inſtruments did Phyſically differ otherwiſe then in the Figure, Size, or Contrivement of the Iron, whereof each of them conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. And proportionably hereunto I do not ſee, why we may not conceive, That as to thoſe Qualities (for Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce) which we call Senſible, though by virtue of a certain Congruity or Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity in point of Figure or Texture, (or other Mechanical Attributes,) to our Senſories, the Portions of Matter they Modifie are enabled to produce various Effects, upon whoſe account we make Bodies to be Endow'd with Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; yet They are not in the Bodies that are Endow'd with them any Real or Diſtinct Entities, or differing from the Matter its ſelf, furniſh'd with ſuch a Determinate Bigneſs, Shape, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mechanical Modifications. Thus though the modern Gold-Smiths and Refiners reckon amongſt the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Qualities of Gold, by which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94784:23"/>
men may be certain of its being True and not Sophiſticated, that is eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble in <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> and that <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will not work upon it; yet theſe Attributes are not in the Gold any thing diſtinct from its peculiar Texture, not is the Gold we have now of any other Nature, then it was in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s time, when <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> and <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> had not been Found out, (at leaſt in theſe parts of the World,) and were utterly unknown to the Roman Gold-Smiths And this Example I have the rather pitch'd upon, becauſe it affords me an Opportunity to repreſent, that, unleſs we admit the Doctrine I have been Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, we muſt Admit, that a Body may have an almoſt Infinite Number o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if one ſhould Invent another Menſtruum, (as poſſibly I may Think my ſelf Maſter of ſuch a one) that will but in part diſſolve pure Gold, and change ſome part of it into another Metalline Body, there will then ariſe another new Property; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diſtinguiſh That from other Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; and yet the Nature of Gold is not a whit other now, then it was before this laſt Menſtruum was firſt made. There are ſome Bodies not Cathartick, nor Sudorifick, with ſome of which Gold being joyn'd acquires a Purgative Vertue, and with others a power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Sweat; and in a word, Nature her ſelf doth, ſometimes otherwiſe, and ſometimes by Chance, produce ſo many things, that have new Relations unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:

And Art, eſpecially aſſiſted by Chymiſtry, may, by variouſly diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Natural Bodies, or Compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either them, or their Conſtituent Parts with one another, make ſuch an Innumerable Company of new Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that will each of Them have new operations, either immediately upon our Senſories, or upon other Bodies, whoſe Changes we are able to perceive, that no man can know, but that the moſt Familiar Bodies may have Multitudes of Qualities, that he dreams not of, and a Conſidering man will hardly imagine, that ſo numerous a Croud of real Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Entities can accrue to a Body, whilſt in the Judgment of all our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it remains Unchang'd, and the Same that 'twas before.</p>
               <p>To clear this a little farther, we may adde, that beaten Glaſs is commonly reckon'd among Poiſons; and (to skip what is mention'd out of <hi>Sanctorius,</hi> of the Dyſentery procur'd by the Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94784:24"/>

Now though the powers of Poiſons be not onely look'd upon as <hi>real</hi> Qualities, but are reckoned among the <hi>Abſtruſeſt</hi> ones: yet this Deleterious Faculty, which is ſuppoſ'd to be a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and Superadded Entitie in the beaten Glaſſe, is really nothing diſtinct from the Glaſs its ſelf, (which though a Concrete made up of thoſe Innocent Ingredients, Salt and Aſhes, is yet a hard and ſtiffe Body,) as it is furniſh'd with that determinate Bigneſs, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Parts, which have been acquir'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94784:25"/>
by Comminution. For theſe Glaſſy Fragments being many, and Rigid, and ſomewhat Small, (without yet being ſo ſmall as Duſt,) and endow'd with ſharp Points and cutting Edges, are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by theſe Mechanical Affections to Pierce or Wound the tender Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Stomach and Guts, and cut the ſlender Veſſels that they meet with there, whereby naturally enſue great Gripings and Contorſions of the injur'd Parts, and oftentimes Bloudy Fluxes occaſion'd by the perforation of the Capillary Arteries, and the great irritation of the Expulſive Faculty, and ſometimes alſo not onely horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions by Conſent of the Brain and Cerebellum, with ſome of the Nervous or Membranous parts that happen to be hurt, but alſo Dropſies occaſioned by the great loſs of Bloud we were juſt now ſpeaking of.

eſpecially in ſome Individuals, whoſe Guts and Stomach too may be of a much ſtronger Texture, and better Lin'd or Stuff'd with Groſs and Slimy Matter, then thoſe of others. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we ſee, that the Fragments of Saphires, Chriſtals, and ev'n Rubies, which are much harder then Glaſs, are innocently, though perhaps not very effectually us'd by Phyſicians, (and I have ſeveral times taken That without Inconvenience) in Cordial Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe of their being by Grinding reduc'd to a Powder too Subtle to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriate, or Grate upon the Stomach, or Guts; and probably 'twas upon ſome ſuch Account, that That happen'd which is related by <hi>Cardan</hi> in the ſame place, namely, That though the three Nuns we have been ſpeaking of were Poiſon'd by the Glaſs, yet many others who eat of the other Portions of the ſame mingled Peaſe, receiv'd no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief thereby.

               <p>And this puts me in mind to adde, That the Multiplicity of Qualities, that are ſometimes to be met with in the ſame Natural Bodies, needs not make men reject the Opinion we have been propoſing, by perſwading them, that ſo many Differing Attributes, as may be ſometimes found in one and the ſame Natural Body, cannot proceed from the bare Texture, and other Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affections of its Matter. For we muſt conſider each Body, not barely as it is in it ſelf an entire and diſtinct porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Matter, but as it is a Part of the Univerſe, and conſequently plac'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a great Number and Variety of other Bodies, upon which it may Act, and by which it may be acted on, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies, (or upon many Accounts,) each of which Men are wont to Fancy,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94784:27"/>
as a diſtinct Power or Quality in the Body, by which thoſe Actions, or in which thoſe Paſſions are produc'd. For if we thus conſider Things, we ſhall not much wonder, that a Portion of Matter, that is indeed endow'd but with a very few Mechanical Affections, as ſuch a determinate Texture and Motion, but is plac'd among a multitude of other Bodies, that differ in thoſe Attributes from it, and one another, ſhould be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of having a great Number and Variety of Relations to thoſe other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and conſequently ſhould be thought to have many Diſtinct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerent Qualities, by ſuch as look upon thoſe ſeveral Relations or Reſpects it may have to Bodies without it, as Real and Diſtinct Entities implanted in the Body it ſelf.

all the reſt of the Univerſe were annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, except any of theſe entire and undivided Corpuſcles, (treated of in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Particular foregoing,) it is hard to ſay what could be attributed to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Matter, Motion (or Reſt,) Bulk, and Shape, (whence by the way you may take notice, that Bulk, though u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually taken in a Comparative ſenſe, is in our ſenſe an abſolute Thing, ſince a Body would have it, though there were no other in the World.) But now there being actually in the Univerſe great Multitudes of Corpuſcles ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led among themſelves, there ariſe in any diſtinct portion of Matter, which a number of them make up, two new Accidents or Events: the one doth more relate to each particular Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in reference to the (really or ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly) ſtable Bodies about it, namely its <hi>Poſture</hi>; (whether Erected, Inclin'd, or Horizontal:) And, when two or more of ſuch Bodies are plac'd one by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94784:32"/>
anorher, the manner of their being ſo plac'd, as one beſides another, or one behind another, may be call'd their <hi>Order</hi>; as I remember, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Metaphyſicks, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. recites this Example out of the antient Corpuſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larians, That <hi>A and N differ in Figure, and A N and N A in Order, Z and N in Scituation</hi>: and indeed Poſture and Order ſeem both of them reducible to Scituation. And when many Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles do ſo convene together as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any diſtinct Body, as a Stone, or a Mettal, then from their other Accidents (or Modes,) and from theſe two laſt mention'd, there doth emerge a certain Diſpoſition or Contrivance of Parts in the whole, which we may call the <hi>Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="5">V. And if we ſhould conceive all the reſt of the Univerſe to be annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſave one ſuch Body, ſuppoſe a Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal or a Stone, it were hard to ſhew, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

then Matter, and the Accidents we have already named. But now we are to conſider, that there are <hi>de facto</hi> in the world certain ſenſible and rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that we call Men, and the body of Man having ſeveral of its external parts, as the Eye, the Ear, &amp;c. each of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and peculiar Texture, whereby it is capable to receive Impreſſions from the Bodies about it, and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is call'd an Organ of Senſe, we muſt conſider, I ſay, that theſe Senſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries may be wrought upon by the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, Shape, Motion, and Texture of Bodies without them, after ſeveral waies, ſome of thoſe External Bodies being fitted to affect the Eye, others the Ear, others the Noſtrils, &amp;c. And to theſe Operations of the Objects on the Senſories, the Mind of Man, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of its Union with the Body perceives them, giveth diſtinct Names, calling the one Light or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the other Sound, the other Odour,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94784:33"/>
&amp;c. And becauſe alſo each Organ of Senſe, as the Eye, or the Palat, may be it ſelf differingly affected by Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Objects, the Mind likewiſe gives the Objects of the ſame Senſe diſtinct Appellations, calling one colour Green, the other Blew, and one taſt Sweet, and another Bitter, &amp;c. Whence Men have been induc'd to frame a long Catalogue of ſuch Things as, for their relating to our Senſes, we call Senſible Qualities; and becauſe we have been converſant with them, before we had the uſe of Reaſon, and the Mind of Man is prone to conceive almoſt every Thing (nay even Privations, as Blindneſs, Death, &amp;c.) under the notion of a true Entitie or Subſtance as it ſelf is, we have been from our Infancy apt to imagine, that theſe Senſible Qualities are Real Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the Objects they denominate, and have the faculty or power to work ſuch and ſuch things; as Gravity hath a power to ſtop the motion of a Bullet
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94784:33"/>
ſhot upwards, and carry that ſolid Globe of Matter toward the Center of the Earth, whereas indeed (according to what we have largely ſhewn above) there is in the Body, to which theſe Senſible Qualities are attributed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Real and Phyſical, but the Size, Shape, and Motion, or Reſt of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent Particles, together with that Texture of the whole, which reſults from their being ſo contriv'd as they are; nor is it neceſſary they ſhould have in them any thing more, like to the Ideas they occaſion in us, thoſe Ideas being <hi>either</hi> the Effects of our Praeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, or Inconſiderateneſs, <hi>or</hi> elſe to be fetcht from the Relation, that happens to be betwixt thoſe Primary Accidents of the Senſible Object, and the peculiar Texture of the Organ it affects; as when a Pin, being run into my Finger, cauſeth pain, there is no diſtinct Quality in the Pin anſwerable to what I am apt to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie Pain to be, but the Pin in it ſelf is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94784:34"/>
onely ſlender, ſtiff, and ſharp, and by thoſe qualities happens to make a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Continuity in my Organ of Touching, upon which, by reaſon of the Fabrick of the Body, and the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Union of the Soul with it, there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth that troubleſome kind of Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we call Pain, and I ſhall anon more particularly ſhew, how much that depends upon the peculiar fabrick of the Body.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. But here I foreſee a Difficulty, which being perhaps the chiefeſt, that we ſhall meet with againſt the Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Hypotheſis, it will deſerve to be, before we proceed any farther, taken notice of. And it is this, that, whereas we explicate Colours, Odours, and the like ſenſible Qualities by a <hi>relation to our Senſes,</hi> it ſeems evident, that they have an <hi>abſolute</hi> Being irrelative to <hi>Us</hi>; for, Snow (for inſtance) would be white, and a glowing Coal would be hot, though there were no Man or any other
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94784:34"/>
Animal in the World: and 'tis plain, that Bodies do not onely by their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities work upon <hi>Our ſenſes,</hi> but upon <hi>other,</hi> and thoſe, Inanimate <hi>Bodies</hi>; as the Coal will not onely heat or burn a <hi>Man's hand</hi> if he touch it, but would likewiſe heat Wax, (even ſo much as to melt it, and make it ſlow,) and thaw Ice into Water, though all the Men, and ſenſitive Beings in the World were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated. To clear this Difficulty, I have ſeveral things to repreſent, and,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay not, that there are no other Accidents in Bodies then Colours, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and the like; for I have already taught, that there are ſimpler and more Primitive Affections of Matter, from which theſe Secondary Qualities, if I may ſo call them, do depend: and that the Operations of Bodies upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpring from the ſame, we ſhall ſee by and by.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor do I ſay, that all Qualities of Bodies are <hi>directly Senſible</hi>; but I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94784:35"/>
that when one Body works upon another, the knowledg we have of their Operation, proceeds, either from ſome ſenſible Quality, or ſome more Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affection of Matter, as Motion, Reſt, or Texture, generated or deſtroy'd in one of them; for elſe it is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how we ſhould come to diſcover what paſſes betwixt them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt not look upon every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Body, that works upon our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as a bare lump of Matter of that bigneſs and outward ſhape, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears of; many of them having their parts curiouſly contriv'd, and moſt of them perhaps in motion too. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> muſt we look upon the Univerſe that ſurrounds us, as upon a moveleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſh'd Heap of Matter, but as upon a great Engine, which, having either no Vacuity, or none that is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, betwixt its parts (known to us,) the actions of particular Bodies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another muſt not be barely aeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94784:35"/>
as if two Portions of Matter of their Bulk and Figure were plac'd in ſome imaginary Space beyond the World, but as being ſcituated in the World, conſtituted as it now is, and conſequently as having their action up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each other liable to be promoted, or hindred, or modify'd by the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other Bodies beſides them: as in a Clock, a ſmall force apply'd to move the Index to the Figure of 12, will make the Haromer ſtrike often and forcibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Bell, and will make a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Commotion among the Wheels and Weights, then a far greater force would do, if the Texture and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Clock did not abundantly contribute to the Production of ſo great an Effect. And in agitating Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Froth, the Whiteneſs would never be produc'd by that Motion, were it not that the Sun, or other Lucid Body, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon that Aggregate of ſmall Bubbles, enables them to reflect confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94784:36"/>
great ſtore of little, and as it were contiguous lucid images to the Eye. And ſo the giving to a large Metalline Speculum a Concave figure, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enable it to ſet Wood on fire, and even to melt down Mettals readily, if the Sun beams, that in Cloudleſs dayes do, as to ſenſe, fill the Air, were not by the help of that Concavity, thrown toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a Point. And to ſhew You by an eminent Inſtance, how various and how differing Effects the Same action of a Natural Agent may produce, according to the ſeveral Diſpoſitions of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies it works upon, do but conſider, that in two Eggs, the one Prolifick, the othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I do not deny, but that Bodies may be ſaid, in a very favourable ſenſe, to have thoſe Qualities we call Senſible, though there were no Animals in the World: for a Body in that caſe may dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from thoſe Bodies, which now are quite devoid of Quality, in its having ſuch a diſpoſition of its Conſtituent Corpuſcles, that in caſe it were duely apply'd to the Senſory of an Animal, it would produce ſuch a ſenſible Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which a Body of another Texture would not; as though if there were no Animals, there would be no ſuch thing as Pain, yet a Pin may upon the account of its Figure be fitted to cauſe pain, in caſe it were mov'd againſt a Man's fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; whereas a Bullet, or other blunt Body mov'd againſt it with no greater
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94784:37"/>
force, will not cauſe any ſuch percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pain. And thus Snow, though if there were no Lucid Body nor Organ of Sight in the World, it would exhibit no Colour at all, (for I could not find it had any in places exactly darkned,) yet it hath a greater diſpoſition then a Coal or Soot to reflect ſtore of Light outwards, when the Sun ſhines upon them all three. And ſo we ſay, that a Lute is in tune, whether it be actually plaid upon or no, if the Strings be all ſo duly ſtretcht, as that it would appear to be in Tune, if it were play'd upon. But as if You ſhould thruſt a Pin into a man's Finger, both a while before and after his Death, though the Pin be as ſharp at one time as at another, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in both caſes alike a Solution of Continuity; yet in the former caſe, the Action of the Pin will produce Pain, and not in the latter, becauſe in this the prick'd Body wants the Soule, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Perceptive Faculty: ſo
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94784:37"/>
if there were no Senſitive Beings, thoſe Bodies that are now the Objects of our Senſes, would be but <hi>diſpoſitively,</hi> if I may ſo ſpeak, endow'd with Colours, Taſts, and the like; and <hi>actually</hi> but onely with thoſe more Catholick Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Bodies, Figure, Motion, Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate this yet a little farther, ſuppoſe a Man ſhould beat a Drum at ſome diſtance from the mouth of a Cave, conveniently ſcituated to return the Noiſe he makes; although Men will preſently conclude, that That Cave hath an Echo, and will be apt to fancy upon that account ſome Real Property in the place, to which the Echo is ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and although indeed the ſame Noiſe made in many other of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring places, would not be reflected to the Eare, and conſequently would manifeſt thoſe places to have no Echos; yet to ſpeak Phyſically of things, this Peculiar Quality or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94784:38"/>
we fancy in the Cave, is in It no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Hollowneſs of its Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, whereby 'tis ſo diſpoſ'd, as when the Air beats againſt it, to reflect the Motion towards the place whence that Motion began; and that which paſſeth on this occaſion is indeed but this, That the Drum ſtick falling upon the Drum, makes a Percuſſion of the Air, and puts that Fluid Body into an Undulating Motion, and the Aery Waves thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on one another, 'till they arrive at the hollow Superficies of the Cave, have by reaſon of its reſiſtance and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, their Motion determin'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way, namely backwards towards that part where the Drum was, vvhen it vvas ſtruck; ſo that in That, vvhich here happens, there intervenes nothing but the Figure of one Body, and the Motion of another, though if a Man's Ear chance to be in the way of theſe Motions of the Air forwards and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards, it gives him a Perception of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94784:38"/>
them, which he calls Sounds; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Perceptions, which are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to proceed from the ſame percuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Drum, and thereby of the Air, are made at diſtinct times one after another, That hollow Body, from whence the Laſt Sound is conceiv'd to come to the Air, is imagin'd to have a peculiar Faculty, upon whoſe account Men are wont to ſay, that ſuch a place hath an Echo.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And whereas one Body doth often ſeem to produce in another divers ſuch Qualities, as we call Senſible, which Qualities therefore ſeem not to need any reference to our Senſes, I conſider, that when one Inanimate Body works upon another, there is nothing really produc'd by the Agent in the Patient, ſave ſome Local Motion of its Parts, or ſome Change of Texture conſequent upon that Motion; and ſo, if the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent come to have any ſenſible Quality, that it had not before, it acquires it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Thus when with a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher You poliſh a rough piece of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that which is really done, is but the Depreſſion of the little Protuberant parts into one Level with the reſt of the Superficies; though upon this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical change of the Texture of the

'Tis true that the Fire doth thaw Ice, and alſo both make Wax ſlow, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it to burn a Man's hand, and yet this doth not neceſſarily argue in it any Inhaerent Quality of Heat, diſtinct from the Power it hath of putting the ſmal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that though we ſuppoſe the Fire to do no more then variouſly and briskly to agitate the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible parts of the Wax, That may ſuffice to make us think the Wax en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with a Quality of Heat: becauſe if ſuch an Agitation be greater then that of the Spirit, and other parts of our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Touching, That is enough to produce in us that Senſation we call Heat; which is ſo much a Relative to the Senſory which apprehends it, that vve ſee, that the ſame Lukevvarm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that is, vvhoſe Corpuſcles are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately agitated by the Fire, will appear hot to one of a Man's hands, if That be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94784:41"/>
very cold; and cold to the other, in caſe it be very hot, though both of them be the ſame Man's hands. To be ſhort, if we fancy any two of the Bodies about us, as a Stone, a Mettal, &amp;c. to have nothing at all to do with any other Body in the Univerſe, 'tis not eaſy to conceive, either how one can act upon the other, but by Local Motion (of the whole Body, or its Corporeal Effluvia;) or how by Motion it can do any more, then put the Parts of the other Body into Motion too, and thereby produce in them a Change of Scituation and Texture, or of ſome other of its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Affections: though this (Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive) Body being plac'd among other Bodies in a World conſtituted as ours now is, and being brought to act upon the moſt curiouſly contriv'd Senſories of Animals, may upon both theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts exhibit many differing ſenſible <hi>Phaenomena</hi>; which however we look upon them as diſtinct Qualities, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently

but the Effects of the often mention'd Catholick affections of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and deducible from the Size, Shape, Motion (or Reſt,) Poſture, Order, and the reſulting Texture of the Inſenſible parts of Bodies. And therefore though, for ſhortneſs of ſpeech, I ſhall not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make uſe of the word <hi>Qualities,</hi> ſince it is already ſo generally receiv'd, yet I would be underſtood to mean them in a ſenſe ſuitable to the Doctrine above deliver'd. As if I ſhould ſay, that Roughneſſe is apt to grate and offend the Skin, I ſhould mean, that a File or other Body, by having upon its Surface a multitude of little hard and exſtant Parts, and of an Angular or ſharp Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, is qualify'd to work the mention'd Effect: and ſo if I ſhould ſay, that Heat melts Mettals, I ſhould mean, that this Fuſion is effected by Fire, or ſome other Body, which by the various and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Motion of its inſenſible parts, does to us appear Hot. And hence,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94784:42"/>
(by the way,) I preſume You will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gueſs at what I think of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy ſo hotly diſputed of late betwixt two parties of Learned Men, whereof the One would have all Accidents to worke onely in virtue of the Matter they reſide in, and the Other would have the Matter to act onely in virtue of its Accidents: for conſidering, that on the one ſide, the Qualities, we here ſpeak of, do ſo depend upon Matter, that they cannot ſo much as have a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but in, and by it; and on the other ſide, if all Matter were but quite devoid of Motion, (to name now no other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,) I do not readily conceive, how it could operate at all, I think it is ſafeſt to conclude, That neither Matter, nor Qualities apart, but both or them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointly do perform, what we ſee done by Bodies to one another, according to the Doctrine of Qualities juſt now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd.</p>

WE may now advance ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what farther, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that Men having taken notice, that certain conſpicuous Accidents were to be found aſſociated in ſome Bodies, and other Conventions of Accidents in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bodies, they did for conveniency, and for the more expeditious Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Conceptions agree to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them into ſeveral Sorts, which they call <hi>Genders</hi> or <hi>Species,</hi> according as they referr'd them either upwards to a more Comprehenſive ſort of Bodies, or downward to a narrower Species, or to Individuals: As, obſerving many Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to agree in being Fuſible, Mallea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Heavy, and the like, they gave to that ſort of Body the name of <hi>Mettal,</hi> which is a <hi>Genus</hi> in reference to Gold, Silver, Lead, and but a <hi>Species</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that ſort of mixt Bodies they

Now when any Body is referr'd to any particular <hi>Species,</hi> (as of a Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, a Stone, or the like,) becauſe Men have for their Convenience agreed to ſignifie all the Eſſentials requiſite to conſtitute ſuch a Body by one Name, moſt of the Writers of Phyſicks have been apt to think, that beſides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Matter of all Bodies, there is but One thing that diſcriminates it from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kinds, and makes it what it is, and this for brevities ſake they call a <hi>Forme</hi>; which, becauſe all the Qualities and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accidents of the Body muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on it, they alſo imagine to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Subſtance, and indeed a kind of Soule, which united to the groſs Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter compoſes with it a Natural Body, and acts in it by the ſeveral Qualities to be found therein, which Men are wont
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94784:43"/>
to aſcribe to the Creature ſo compoſ'd. But as to this affair, I obſerve, that if (for Inſtance) You ask a Man, what Gold is, if he cannot ſhew you a piece of Gold, and tell You, This is Gold, he will deſcribe it to You as a Body, that is extremely Ponderous, very Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable and Ductile, Fuſible and yet Fixt in the Fire, and of a Yellowiſh colour: and if You offer to put off to him a piece of Braſs for a piece of Gold, he will preſently refuſe it, and (if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Mettals) tell You, that though Your Braſs be coloured like it, 'tis not ſo heavy, nor ſo malleable, neither will it like Gold reſiſt the utmoſt brunt of the Fire, or reſiſt <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi>: and if You ask Men what they mean by a Ruby, or Niter, or a Pearl, they will ſtill make You ſuch Anſwers, that You may clearly perceive, that whatever Men talk in Theory of Subſtantial Forms, yet That, upon whoſe account they really diſtinguiſh any one Body

And indeed, ſince to every Determinate <hi>Species</hi> of Bodies, there doth belong more then One Quality, and for the moſt part a concurrence of Many is ſo Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to That ſort of Bodies, that the want of any of them is ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it from belonging to that <hi>Species</hi>: there needs no more to diſcriminate ſufficiently any One kind of Bodies from all the Bodies in the World, that are not of that kind; as the Chymiſts <hi>Luna <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

then Two. Nor need we think that Qualities being but Accidents, they cannot be <hi>eſsential</hi> to a Natural Body; for Accident, as I formerly noted, is ſometimes oppoſ'd to Subſtance, and ſometimes to Eſſence: and though an Accident can be but accidental to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it is a Subſtantial thing, yet it may be eſſential to this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Body; as in <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> newly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Example, though Roundneſs is but Accidental to Braſs, yet 'tis Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a Braſen Sphaere; becauſe, though the Braſſe were devoid of Roundneſſe, (as if it were Cubical, or of any other figure,) it would ſtill be a Corporeal Subſtance, yet without that Roundneſs it could not be a Sphaere: wherefore ſince an Aggregate or Convention of Qualities is enough to make the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Matter 'tis found in, what it is, and denominate it of this or that Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſort of Bodies; and ſince thoſe Qualities, as we have ſeen already, do

themſelves proceed from thoſe more Primary and Catholick affections of Matter, Bulk, Shape, Motion or Reſt, and the Texture thence reſulting, why may we not ſay, that the Form of a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being made up of thoſe Qualities u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited in one Subject, doth likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ſuch a Convention of thoſe new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nam'd Mechanical Affections of Matter, as is neceſſary to conſtitute a Body of that Determinate kind. And ſo, though I ſhall for brevities ſake retain the word <hi>Forme,</hi> yet I would be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to mean by it, not a Real <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> diſtinct from Matter, but onely the Matter it ſelf of a Natural Body, conſider'd with its peculiar manner of Exiſtence, which I think may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniently be call'd either its <hi>Specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> or its <hi>Denominating State,</hi> or its <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Modification,</hi> or, if you would have me expreſs it in one word, its <hi>Stamp:</hi> for ſuch a Convention of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents is ſufficient to perform the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94784:46"/>
that are neceſſarily requir'd in what Men call a Forme, ſince it makes the Body ſuch as it is, making it appertain to this or that Determinate Species of Bodies, and diſcriminating it from all other Species of Bodies whatſoever: as for Inſtance, Ponderouſneſs, Ductility, Fixtneſſe, Yellowneſs, and ſome other Qualities, concurring in a portion of Matter, do with it conſtitute Gold, and making it belong to that Species we call Mettals, and to that ſort of Mettals we call Gold, do both denominate and diſcriminate it from Stones, Salts, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſites, and all other ſorts of Bodies that are not Mettals, and from Silver, Braſs, Copper, and all Mettals except Gold. And whereas 'tis ſaid by ſome, that the Forme alſo of a Body ought to be the Principle of its Operations, we ſhall hereafter conſider in what ſenſe That is to be admitted or rejected, in the mean time it may ſuffice us, that even in the Vulgar Philoſophy 'tis acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,

that Natural Things for the moſt part operate by their Qualities, as Snow dazles the Eyes by its Whiteneſs, and Water ſcatter'd into drops of Rain falls from the Clouds upon the account of its Gravity. To which I ſhall adde, that how great the power may be, which a Body may exerciſe by virtue of a ſingle Quality, may appear by the Various and oftentimes Prodigious Effects, which Fire produces by its Heat, when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it melts Mettals, calcines Stones, deſtroyes whole Woods and Cities &amp;c.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94784:48"/>
(Three Names, that have very much puzled and divided Philoſophers.) In order hereunto we may conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there are in the World great ſtore of Particles of Matter, each of which is too ſmall to be, whilſt ſingle, Senſible; and being Entire, or Undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, muſt needs both have its Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Shape, and be very Solid. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that though it be <hi>mentally,</hi> and by Divine Omnipotence diviſible, yet by reaſon of its Smalneſs and Solidity, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ſcarce ever actually divide it; and theſe may in this ſenſe be call'd <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima</hi> or <hi>Prima Naturalia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That there are alſo Multitudes of Corpuſcles, which are made up of the Coalition of ſeveral of the former <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima Naturalia</hi>; and whoſe Bulk is ſo ſmall, and their Adhaeſion ſo cloſe and ſtrict, that each of theſe little Primitive Concretions or Cluſters (if I may ſo call them) of Particles is ſingly below the diſcernment of Senſe, and though not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94784:49"/>
abſolutely indiviſible by Nature into the <hi>Prima Naturalia</hi> that compoſ'd it, or perhaps into other little Fragments, yet, for the reaſons freſhly intimated, they very rarely happen to be actually diſſolv'd or broken, but remain entire in great variety of ſenſible Bodies, and under various forms or diſguiſes. As, not to repeat, what we lately mention'd of the undeſtroy'd purging Corpuſcles of Milk; we ſee, that even Groſſer and more compounded Corpuſcles may have ſuch a permanent Texture: For Quickſilver, for inſtance, may be turn'd into a red Powder for a Fuſible and Malleable Body, or a Fugitive Smoak, and diſguiſ'd I know not how many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes, and yet remain true and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable Mercury. And theſe are as it were the Seeds, or immediate Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of many ſorts of Natural Bodies, as Earth, Water, Salt, &amp;c. and thoſe ſingly inſenſible, become capable, when united, to affect the Senſe: as I have
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94784:49"/>
try'd, that if good Camphire be kept a while in pure Spirit of Wine, it will thereby be reduc'd into ſuch Little parts, as totally to diſappear in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, without making it look leſs clear then fair Water, and yet, if into this Mixture you pour a competent quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Water, in a moment the ſcatter'd Corpuſcles of the Camphire will, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniting themſelves, become White, and conſequently Viſible, as before their Diſperſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That as well each of the <hi>Minima Naturalia,</hi> as each of the Primary Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters above mention'd, having its own Determinate Bulk &amp; Shape, when theſe come to adhere to one another, it muſt <hi>alwaies</hi> happen, that the Size, and <hi>often,</hi> that the Figure of the Corpuſcle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd by their Juxta-poſition and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haeſion, will be chang'd: and <hi>not ſeldome</hi> too, the Motion either of the one, or the other, or both, will receive a new Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, or be alter'd as to its Velocity,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94784:50"/>
or otherwiſe. And the like will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, when the Corpuſcles, that compoſe a Cluſter of Particles, are disjoyn'd, or any thing of the little Maſs is broken off. And whether any thing of Matter be added to a Corpuſcle, or taken from it in either caſe, (as we juſt now intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,) the Size of it muſt neceſſarily be alter'd, and for the moſt part the Figure will be ſo too, whereby it will both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Congruity to the Pores of ſome Bodies, (and perhaps ſome of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſories,) and become Incongruous to thoſe of others, and conſequently be qualify'd, as I ſhall more fully ſhew you hereafter, to operate on diverſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, much otherwiſe then it was fitted to do before.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That when many of theſe inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Corpuſcles come to be aſſociated into one viſible Body, if many or moſt of them be put into Motion, from what cauſe ſoever the Motion proceeds, That it ſelf may produce great Changes, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94784:50"/>
new Qualities in the Body they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for <hi>not onely</hi> Motion may perform much, even when it makes not any viſible Alteration in it, as Air put into ſwift Motion, (as when it is blown out of Bellows) acquires a new Name, and is call'd <hi>Wind,</hi> and to the Touch appears far colder then the ſame <hi>Air</hi> not ſo form'd into a Stream; and Iron, by being briskly rubb'd againſt Wood or other Iron, hath its ſmall parts ſo agitated, as to appear hot to our Senſe: <hi>but</hi> this Motion oftentimes makes viſible Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in the Texture of the Body into which it is receiv'd, for alwaies the Moved parts ſtrive to communicate their Motion, or ſomewhat of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it, to ſome parts that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either at Reſt, or otherwiſe mov'd, and oftentimes the ſame Mov'd parts do thereby either disjoyn, or break ſome of the Corpuſcles they hit againſt, and thereby change their Bulk, or Shape, or both, and either drive ſome
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94784:51"/>
of them quite out of the Body, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps lodge themſelves in their places, or elſe aſſociate them anew with others. Whence it uſually follows, that the Texture, is for a while at leaſt, and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be very ſtable and permanent, for good and all, very much alter'd, and eſpecially, in that the Pores or little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals intercepted betwixt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent Particles, will be chang'd as to Bigneſs, or Figure, or both, and ſo will ceaſe to be commenſurate to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles that were fit for them before, and become commenſurate to ſuch Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles of other Sizes and Shapes, as till then were incongruous to them Thus we ſee that Water, by looſing the wonted agitation of its parts, may acquire the Firmneſſe and Brittleneſſe we find in Ice, and looſe much of the Tranſparency it had whilſt it was a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. Thus alſo by very hard rubbing two pieces of Reſinous Wood againſt one another, we may make them throw
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94784:51"/>
out diverſe of their looſer parts into Steams and viſible Smoak, and may, if the Attrition be duely continued, make that commotion of the parts ſo change the Texture of the whole, as afterwards to turn the ſuperficial parts into a kind of Coal. And thus Milk, eſpecially in hot weather, will by the inteſtine, though languid, Motions of its parts, be in a ſhort time turn'd into a thinner ſort of liquor then Milk, and into Cream, and this (laſt nam'd) will by being barely agitated in a Churn, be turn'd in a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time into that Unctuous and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent Body we call Butter, and into thin, fluid, and ſower Butter-milk. And thus (to diſpatch) by the bruiſing of Fruit, the Texture is commonly ſo chang'd, that as we ſee particularly in Apples, that the Bruiſ'd part ſoon comes to be of another nature then the Sound part, the one differing from the other both in Colour, Taſt, Smell, and Conſiſtence. So that (as we have already inculcated)
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94784:52"/>
                  <hi>Local Motion</hi> hath, of all other affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Matter, the greateſt Intereſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Altering and Modifying of it, ſince it is not onely the Grand <hi>Agent</hi> or <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> among Second Cauſes, but is alſo oftentimes one of the principal things that <hi>conſtitutes the Forme</hi> of Bodies: as when two Sticks are ſet on fire by long and vehement Attrition, Local <hi>Motion</hi> is not onely that which kindles the Wood, and ſo as an Efficient produces the Fire, but is That which principally concurrs to give the produced Stream of ſhining Matter, the name and nature of Flame: and ſo it concurrs alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute all Fluid Bodies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And that ſince we have formerly ſeen, that 'tis from the Size, Shape, and Motion of the ſmall parts of Matter, and the Texture that reſults from the manner of their being diſpoſ'd in any one Body, that the Colour, Odour, Taſt, and other qualities of that Body are to be deriv'd, it will be eaſie for us
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94784:52"/>
to recollect, That ſuch Changes cannot happen in a portion of Matter, without ſo much varying the Nature of it, that we need not deride the antient Ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, for attempting to deduce the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> and <hi>Corruption</hi> of Bodies from the fam'd <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94784:53"/>
to <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Corruption,</hi> as to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration</hi>: as we ſee when Milk, or Fleſh or Fruit, without any remarkable addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or loſs of parts turns into Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, or other Inſects; and as we may more conſpicuouſly obſerve in the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation of Mercury without addition, in the Vitrification of Mettals, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chymical Experiments to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after mention'd.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſ'd, it will not now be difficult to compriſe in few words ſuch a Doctrine, touching the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, Corruption,</hi> and <hi>Alteration</hi> of Bodies, as is ſuitable to our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and the former Diſcourſe. For if in a parcel of Matter there happen to be produc'd (it imports not much how) a Concurrence of all thoſe Accidents, (whether thoſe onely, or more) that Men by tacite agreement have thought <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>ſufficient</hi> to conſtitute any one Determinate <hi>Species</hi> of things cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, then we ſay, That a Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94784:53"/>
to that <hi>Species,</hi> as ſuppoſe a Stone, or a Mettal, is <hi>Generated,</hi> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd <hi>de novo.</hi> Not that there is really any thing of <hi>Subſtantial</hi> produc'd, but that thoſe parts of Matter, that did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed before praeexiſt, but were either ſcatter'd and ſhar'd among other Bodies, or at leaſt otherwiſe diſpoſ'd of, are now brought together, and diſpoſ'd of after the manner requiſite, to entitle the Body that reſults from them to a <hi>new Denomination,</hi> and make it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ſuch a Determinate <hi>Species</hi> of Natural Bodies, ſo that no new <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> is in Generation <hi>produc'd,</hi> but onely That, which was <hi>praeexiſtent,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teins a new <hi>Modification,</hi> or manner of Exiſtence. Thus when the Spring, and Wheels, and String, and Balance, and Index &amp;c. neceſſary to a Watch, which lay before ſcatter'd, ſome in one part, ſome in another of the Artificer's Shop, are firſt ſet together in the Order requiſite to make ſuch an Engine, to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94784:54"/>
ſhew how the time paſſes, a watch is ſaid to be <hi>made</hi>: not that any of the mention'd Material parts is <hi>produc'd de novo,</hi> but that till then the divided Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not ſo <hi>contriv'd</hi> and put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as was requiſite to conſtitute ſuch a thing, as we call a Watch. And ſo when Sand and Aſhes are well melted together, and ſuffer'd to cool, there is Generated by the Colliquation that ſort of Concretion we call <hi>Glaſs,</hi> though it be evident, that its Ingredients were both praeexiſtent, and do but by their <hi>Aſſociation</hi> obtain a New manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting together. And ſo when by the Churning of Creame, Butter and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-milk are generated, we find not any thing Subſtantial Produc'd <hi>de novo</hi> in either of them, but onely that the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and the fat Corpuſcles, being put into Local Motion, do by their frequent Occurſions extricate themſelves from each other, and aſſociate themſelves in the new manner, requiſite to conſtitute

the Bodies, whoſe names are given them.</p>
               <p>And as a Body is ſaid to be <hi>generated,</hi> when it firſt appears clothed with all thoſe Qualities, upon whoſe Account Men have been pleaſ'd to call ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <hi>Stones</hi>; others, <hi>Mettals</hi>; others, <hi>Salts,</hi> &amp;c. ſo when a Body comes to looſe <hi>all</hi> or <hi>any</hi> of thoſe Accidents that are <hi>Eſſential,</hi> and neceſſary to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of ſuch a Body, it is then ſaid to be <hi>corrupted</hi> or deſtroy'd, and is no more a Body of <hi>that Kind,</hi> but looſes its Title to its former Denomination. Not that any thing <hi>Corporeal</hi> or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial <hi>periſhes</hi> in this <hi>Change,</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Eſſential Modification of the Matter is deſtroy'd: and though the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be ſtill a <hi>Body,</hi> (no Natural Agent being able to <hi>annihilate</hi> Matter,) yet 'tis no longer <hi>ſuch a Body,</hi> as 'twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but periſheth in the capacity of a Body of that Kind.

               <p>And here we have a fair Occaſion to take notice of the Fruitfulneſſe and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of our Mechanical Hypotheſis: For ſince according to our Doctrine, the World we live in is not a Moveleſſe or Indigeſted Maſs of Matter, but an <gap reason="foreign">

caſes) they have either no Vacuities betwixt them, or onely here and there interpos'd, and very ſmall ones. And ſince, according to us, the various <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>Coalition</hi> of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Corpuſcles</hi> into one viſible <hi>Body</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to give them a peculiar Texture, and thereby fitt them to exhibit divers ſenſible Qualities, and to become a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſometimes of one Denomination, and ſometimes of another; it will very naturally follow, that from the various Occurſions of thoſe innumerable ſwarms of little Bodies, that are mov'd to and fro in the World, there will be many fitted to ſtick to one another, and ſo compoſe Concretions; and many (though not in the ſelf ſame place) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd from one another, and agitated apart; and multitudes alſo that will be driven to aſſociate themſelves, now with one Body, and preſently with another. And if we alſo conſider on the one ſide, that the Sizes of the ſmall Particles of

Matter may be very <hi>various,</hi> their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures almoſt <hi>innumerable,</hi> and that if a parcel of Matter do but happen to ſtick to one Body, it may chance to give it a new Quality, and if it adhere to another, or hit againſt ſome of its Parts, it may conſtitute a Body of another Kind; or if a parcel of Matter be knockt off from another, it may barely by That, leave It, and become it ſelf of another Nature then before. If, I ſay, we conſider theſe things on the one ſide; and on the other ſide, that (to uſe <hi>Lucretius</hi> his Compariſon) all that innumerable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Words, that are contain'd in all the Languages of the World, are made of the various Combinations of ſome of the 24 Letters of the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet; 'twill not be hard to conceive, that there may be an incomprehenſible va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Aſſociations and Textures of the Minute parts of Bodies, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a vaſt Multitude of Portions of Matter endow'd with ſtore enough of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94784:60"/>
differing Qualities, to deſerve diſtinct Appellations; though for want of heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and fit Words, Men have not yet taken ſo much notice of their leſſe obvious Varieties, as to ſort them as they deſerve, and give them diſtinct and proper Names. So that though I would not ſay, that Any thing can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately be made of Every thing, as a Gold Ring of a <hi>VVedge</hi> of Gold, or Oyl, or Fire of Water; yet ſince Bodies, having but one common Matter, can be differenc'd but by Accidents, which ſeem all of them to be the Effects and Conſequents of Local Motion, I ſee not, why it ſhould be abſurd to think, that (at leaſt among Inanimate Bodies) by the Intervention of ſome very ſmall <hi>Addition</hi> or <hi>Subſtraction</hi> of Matter, (which yet in moſt caſes will ſcarce be needed,) and of an orderly <hi>Series of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations,</hi> diſpoſing by degrees the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be tranſmuted, almoſt of any thing, may at length be made Any
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94784:61"/>
thing: as, though out of a <hi>wedge</hi> of Gold one cannot immediately make a <hi>Ring,</hi> yet by either Wyre-drawing that Wedge by degrees, or by melting it, and caſting a little of it into a Mould, That thing may eaſily be effected. And ſo though Water cannot immediately be tranſmuted into Oyl, and much leſs into Fire, yet if you nouriſh certain Plants with Water alone, (as I have done,) 'till they have aſſimilated a great quantity of Water into their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, You may, by committing this Tranſmuted Water (which you may diſtinguiſh and ſeparate from that part of the Vegetable you firſt put in) to Diſtillation in convenient Glaſſes, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, beſides other things, a true Oyl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a black combuſtible Coal, (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Fire,) both of which may be ſo copious, as to leave no juſt cauſe to ſuſpect, that they could be any thing neer afforded by any little Spirituous parts, which may be praeſum'd to have

The I. SECTION, Containing the <hi>Obſervations.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the foregoing Notes I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with as much Clearneſs, as the Difficulty of the Subject, and the Brevity I was confined to, permitted to give a Scheme or Summary of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Corpuſcularian Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, as I apprehended them, by way of a ſhort Introduction to it, at leaſt as far as I judged neceſſary for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of what is contain'd in our Notes and Experiments concerning the Productions and Changes of particular Qualities. But though, I hope, I have not ſo affected Brevity, as to fall into Obſcurity; yet ſince theſe Principles are built upon the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and deviſ'd in order to the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94784:67"/>
of them, I know not what I can do more proper to recommend them, then to ſubjoyn ſome ſuch Natural <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> as either induce me to take up ſuch Notions, or which I was dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to find out by the Notions I had imbrac'd. And ſince I appeale to the Teſtimony of Nature to verifie the Doctrine I have been propoſing, about the Origine and Production of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, (for that of Formes will require a diſtinct Diſcourſe,) I think it very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſet down ſome Obſervations of what Nature does, without being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd by the Power and Skill of Man, as well as ſome Experiments wherein Nature is guided, and as it were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd by Art, that ſo ſhe may be made to atteſt the Truth of our Doctrine, as well, when ſhe diſcloſes her Self freely, and, if I may ſo ſpeak, of her Own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, as when ſhe is as it were Cited to make her Depoſitions by the Induſtry of Man. The Obſervations will be but
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94784:67"/>
the more ſuitable to our Deſign for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Common and Familiar, as to the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> though perhaps New e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough as to the Application to our Purpoſe. And as for the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe thoſe that belong more immediately to this or that particular Quality, may be met with in the Notes that treat of It, I thought it not amiſſe that the Experiments ſhould be both Few in number, and yet ſo Pregnant, that every one of them ſhould afford ſuch differing <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> as may make it applicable to more then One Quality.</p>
               <div n="1" type="subsection">
                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>The Obſervation I will begin with ſhall be fetch'd from what happens in the Hatching of an Egge. For as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and obvious a thing as it is, (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially after what the Learned <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius ab Aqua pendente,</hi> and a recenter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomiſt have delivered about them,) that there is a great Change made in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94784:68"/>
the ſubſtance of the Egge, when 'tis by Incubation turn'd into a Chick: yet, as far as I know, this Change hath not been taken notice of, for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to which I am about to apply it.</p>
                  <p>I conſider then, that in a Prolifick Egge, (for Inſtance that of a Hen,) as well the Liquor of the Yolk, as that of the White, is a Subſtance, as to ſenſe, Similar. For upon the ſame account that Anatomiſts and Phyſicians call ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the humane Body, as Bones, Membranes, &amp;c. Similar, that is, ſuch, as that every Senſible part of it hath the ſame Nature or Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the whole, as every Splinter of Bone is Bone, as every Shred of Skin is Skin.</p>
                  <p>And though I find by diſtilling the Yolks and Whites, they ſeem to be Diſſimilar Bodies, in regard that the White of an Egge (for Example) will afford Subſtances of a very differing Nature, as Flegme, Salt, Oyl, and Earth,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94784:68"/>
yet (not now to examine whether, or how far theſe may be eſteem'd Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Fire, that are rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd from the White of the Egge, then were praeexiſtent in it; not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this I ſay,) it doth not appear by Diſtillation, that the White of an Egg, is other then a Similar Body in the ſenſe above deliver'd. For it would be hard to prove, that one part of the White of an Egg will not be made to yield the ſame differing Subſtances by Diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that any other part does; and Bones themſelves, and other hard parts of a humane Body, that are confeſſedly Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar, may by Diſtillation be made to afford Salt, and Phlegme, and Spirit, and Oyl, and Earth, as well as the White of an Egg.</p>
                  <p>This being thus ſetled in the Firſt place, we may in the Next conſider, that by beating the White of an Egge well with a Whisk, you may reduce it from a ſomewhat Tenacious into a Fluid
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94784:69"/>
Body, though this Production of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor be, as we elſewhere noted, effected by a Divulſion, Agitation &amp;c. of the parts, that is in a word, by a Mechanical change of the Texture of the Body.</p>
                  <p>In the Third place I conſider, that according to the exacteſt Obſervations of Modern Anatomiſts, which our own Obſervations do not contradict, the Rudiments of the Chick, lodg'd in the <hi>Cicatricula,</hi> or white Speck upon the Coat of the Yolk, is nouriſh'd, 'till it have obtain'd to be a great Chick, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the White of the Egg; the Yolk being by the Providence of Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd as a more ſtrong and ſolid Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till the Chick have abſum'd the White, and be thereby grown great and ſtrong enough to digeſt the Yolk; and in effect you may ſee the Chick fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd not onely with all the neceſſary, but divers other parts, as Head, Wings, Legs, and Beak, and Claws, whilſt the Yolk ſeems yet as it were untouch'd.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94784:69"/>
But whether this Obſervation about the Entireneſs of the Yolk be preciſely true, is not much material to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, nor would I be thought to build much upon it; ſince the Yolk it ſelf, eſpecially at that time, is wont to be fluid enough, and to be a Liquor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no leſs ſo then the White was, and That is enough for my preſent purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>For in the Laſt place I conſider, that the Nutritive Liquor of an Egg, which is in it ſelf a Body ſo very ſoft, that by a little Agitation it may be made Fluid, and is readily enough diſſolvable in common cold water, this very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I ſay, being brooded on by the Hen, will within two or three weeks be tranſmuted into a Chick, furniſh'd with Organical parts, as Eyes, Ears, Wings, Legs, &amp;c. of a very differing Fabrick, and with a good number of Similar ones, as Bones, Cartilages, Ligaments, Tendons, Membranes, &amp;c. which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer very much in Texture from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94784:70"/>
beſides the Liquors, as Blood, Chyle, Gall, &amp;c. contain'd in the ſolid parts: So that here we have out of the White of an Egg, which is a Subſtance Similar, Inſipid, Soft, (not to call it Fluid,) Diaphanous, Colourleſſe, and readily diſſoluble in cold water, out of this Subſtance I ſay, we have by the new and various Contrivement of the ſmall parts it conſiſted of, an Animal, ſome of whoſe parts are not Tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent but Opacous; ſome of them Red, as the Bloud; ſome Yellow or Gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, as the Gall; ſome White, as the Brain; ſome Fluid, as the Bloud, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juices; ſome Conſiſtent, as the Bones, Fleſh, and other ſtable parts of the Body; ſome Solid and Frangible, as the Bones, others Tough and Flexible, as the Ligaments, others Soft and looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cohaerent, as the Marrow; ſome without Springs, as many of the parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome with Springs, as the Feathers, ſome apt to mingle readily with cold
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94784:70"/>
water, as the Bloud, the Gall; ſome not to be <hi>ſo</hi> diſſolv'd in it, as the Bones, the Claws, and the Feathers; ſome well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, as the Fleſh and Bloud; ſome very ill taſted, as the Gall, (for That I have purpoſely and particularly obſerv'd.) In a word, we have here produc'd out of ſuch an uniforme Matter as the White of an Egg,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, new kind of Qualities, as (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Opacity) Colours, (whereof a ſingle Feather will ſometimes afford us Variety,) Odours, Taſts, and Heat in the Heart and Bloud of the Chick; Hardneſs, Smoothneſs, Roughneſs, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, diverſe other Qualities, that are wont to be diſtinguiſh'd from Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ones, as Fluidity (in the Bloud and aqueous humor of the Eye,) Conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Griſles, Fleſh, &amp;c. Hardneſſe, Flexibility, Springyneſſe, Toughneſs, unfitneſſe to be diſſolv'd in cold water, and ſeveral others. To which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be added</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:94784:71"/>Thirdly, ſome Occult Properties as Phyſicians obſerve, that ſome Birds, as young Swallows, young Magpies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Specifick, or at leaſt Noble Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, in the Falling ſickneſs, Hyſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Fits, and divers other Diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I very well foreſee it may be objected, that the Chick with all its parts is not a Mechanically contriv'd Engine, but faſhion'd out of Matter by the Soul of the Bird, lodg'd chiefly in the <hi>Cicatricula,</hi> which by its Plaſtick power faſhions the obſequious Matter, and becomes the Architect of its own Manſion. But not here to examine, whether any Animal, except Man, be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a Curious Engine, I anſwer, that this Objection invalidates not what I intend to prove from the alledg'd Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. For let the Plaſtick Principle be what it will, yet ſtill, being a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Agent, it muſt act after a Phyſical manner, and having no other Matter to work upon but the White of the Egg,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94784:71"/>
it can work upon that Matter but as Phyſical Agents, and conſequently can but divide the Matter into minute parts of ſeveral Sizes and Shapes, and by Local Motion variouſly context them, according to the Exigency of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal to be produc'd, though from ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny various Textures of the produc'd parts there muſt naturally emerge ſuch differences of Colours, Taſts, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies, and other Qualities as we have been taking notice of. That which we are here to conſider, is not what is the Agent or Efficient in theſe Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but what is done to the Matter to effect them. And though ſome Birds by an inbred Skill do very Artificially build their Curious Neſts, yet cannot Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that teaches them, enable them to do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94784:72"/>
parts of the Egg by the external heat, whereby it is hatch'd, is evident of its ſelf, and not (as far as I know) deny'd by any, and that alſo the white Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is abſumed and contexted, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd into the Body of the Chick, and its ſeveral parts, is manifeſt to ſenſe; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if one hath the Curioſity to obſerve the progreſs of the Chicks Formation and Increment. But as 'tis evident, that as theſe two things, the Subſtance of the White, and the Local Motion, wherein the External Heat neceſſary to Incubation puts its parts, do eminently concurr to the Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chick; ſo that the Formative Power (whatever that be) doth any more then guide theſe Motions, and thereby aſſociate the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Taſtleſs, Inodorous, Diaphanous, Colourleſs, Volatile, &amp;c. may, by a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Texture of its Parts, be brought to conſtitute Bodies of Attributes very diſtant from theſe. This I thought might be done, by nouriſhing Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles with ſimple water. For in caſe I could do ſo, all, or the greateſt part of that which would accrue to the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thus nouriſh'd, would appear to have been materially but Water, with what Exotick Quality ſoever it may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when tranſmuted, be endow'd.</p>
                  <p>The Ingenious <hi>Helmont</hi> indeed men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions an Experiment ſomewhat of this nature, though not to the ſame purpoſe, which he made by planting a Branch of Willow into a Pot full of Earth, and obſerving the increaſe of Weight he obtain'd after divers years, though he fed the Plant but with Rain water. And ſome Learned Modern Naturaliſts have conjectur'd at the eaſy Tranſmutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Water, by what happens in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94784:74"/>
Gardens and Orchards, where the ſame Showers or Rain after a long Drought makes a great number of differing Plants to flouriſh. But though theſe things be worthy of their Authors, yet I thought they would not be ſo fit for my purpoſe, becauſe it may be ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly enough objected, That the Rain water does not make theſe Plants thrive and flouriſh, by immediately affording them the Aliments they aſſimilate into their own Subſtance, but by proving a Vehicle, that diſſolves the Saline, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Alimental Subſtances of the Earth, and dilutes both them and the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juice, which, in a part of the Plant its ſelf, it may find too much thickned by the Drought or Heat of the ambient Air, and by this means it contributes to the nouriſhment of the Plant, though it ſelf be inſenſibly afterwards exhal'd into vapours. And indeed Experience ſhews us, that ſeveral Plants, that thrive not well without Rain water, are not

yet nouriſh'd by it alone, ſince when Corn in the Field, and Fruit-trees in Orchards have conſum'd the Saline and Sulphureous Juices of the Earth, they will not proſper there, how much Rain ſoever falls upon the Land, till the Ground by Dung or otherwiſe be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd again with ſuch aſſimilable Juices. Wherefore I rather choſe to attempt the making of Plants grow in Viols fill'd with Water, not onely to prevent the forementioned Objection, and alſo to make the Experiment leſſe tedious, but that I might have the pleaſure of ſeeing the progreſs of Nature in the Tranſmutation of Water; and my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of this kind as Novelties, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd by any other Writer, I ſhew'd divers Ingenious Freinds, who having better Opportunities then I of ſtaying in one place, have attempted the like, and made ſuccesful Trials, which, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, will not be conceal'd from the publick. Of my Obſervations about
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94784:75"/>
things of this kind, I can at preſent find but few among my <hi>Adverſaria</hi>; but in Them I find enough for my preſent turn. For They and my Memory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me, that <hi>Vinca per Vinca, Rapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Aquaticus,</hi> Spearemint, and even <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunculus</hi> it ſelf, did grow and proſper very well in Viols filld with fair water, by whoſe Necks the Leaves were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and the Plant kept from ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſome of theſe were onely Cuttings without Roots, divers of them were left in the water all the Autumn, and great part of the Winter, and at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of January were taken out ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and with fair Roots, which they had ſhot in the water. And beſides I find, that particularly a Branch or Sprig of <hi>Raphanus Aquaticus</hi> was kept full nine Months, and during that time wither'd not the whole Winter, and was taken out of the water with many fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous Roots, and ſome green Buds, and an increaſe of Weight, and that a Stump
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94784:75"/>
of <hi>Ranunculus</hi> did ſo proſper in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that in a Months time it had attain'd to a pretty deale more then double the weight it had, when it was put in. And the next Note, which I find concerning theſe Plants, informes me, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mention'd Crowsfoot being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out <hi>agen</hi> at ſix Months after it was put in, weigh'd a Drachm and a half wanting a Grain and a half, that is, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above Thrice as much as it did at firſt. This laſt Circumſtance (of the increaſe of Weight) I therefore thought fit particularly to make Trial of, and ſet down upon this account among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, That having doubted the Roots and Leaves, that ſeem'd produc'd out of the Water, might really be ſo, by an Oblongation and an Expanſion of the Plants, (as I have purpoſely try'd, that an Onion weigh'd and laid up in the Spring, though after ſome weeks keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Air it ſhot Blades, whereof one was five Inches long, in ſtead of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94784:76"/>
incorporating the Air or terreſtrial <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluviums</hi> with it ſelf, and conſequently thereby growing heavier, had loſt nine Grains of its former weight,) it might by this Circumſtance appear, that there may be a real Aſſimilation and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of Water into the Subſtance of the Vegetable, as I elſewhere alſo ſhew by other proofs. For this being made out, from thence I infer, That the ſame Corpuſcles, which, convening to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether after one manner, compoſe that fluid, Inodorous, colourleſs, and inſipid Body of Water being contexted after other manners, may conſtitute differing Concretes, which may have Firmeneſs, Opacity, Odours, Smels, Taſts, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and ſeveral other manifeſt Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that too very different from one another. And beſides all this, theſe diſtinct Portions of Tranſmuted Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may have many other Qualities, without excepting thoſe that are wont to be call'd Specifick, or Occult, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94784:76"/>
the ſeveral Medicinal Virtues attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by Authors to Spearmint, and to Periwinckle, to Majorane, and to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus Aquaticus.</hi> And as for <hi>Ranun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,</hi> that Plant being reckoned among Poiſonous ones, and among thoſe that raiſe Bliſters, 'twill be eaſily granted, that it hath, as other Poiſons, an Occult Deleterial faculty; and indeed it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what deſerves our wonder, that ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid and innocent a thing as fair Water, ſhould be capable to be turn'd into a Subſtance of ſuch a piercing and cauſtick Nature, as by Contact to raiſe Bliſters on an humane Body. And yet perhaps that is no leſſe ſtrange, which we elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where relate, That a Plant, conſiſting chiefly of Tranſmuted Water, did by Diſtillation afford us a true Oyl, that would not mingle with Water, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently was eaſily convertible into Fire. But whether or no this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any ſuch like, prove, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt All things may be made of All
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94784:77"/>
things, not immediately, but by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of ſucceſſive Changes and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, is a Queſtion to which we elſewhere ſay ſomething, but are not willing in this place to ſay any thing. And if it be here objected, That the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Subſtance, that accrues to a Plant rooted in Water, procceds not at all from the water it ſelf, but from the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, fat, and earthy Subſtances, that may be preſum'd to abound even in common Water, not here to repeat what I elſewhere ſay about this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I ſhall at preſent reply, That though as to divers Plants, that flouriſh after Raine, I am apt to think, as I inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated above, that they may in part be nouriſh'd as well by the Saline and Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Subſtances, to which the Rain uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prooves a Vehicle, as by the Rain it ſelf; yet as to what the Objection holds forth about the Plants, that grow not in the Ground, but in Glaſſes fill'd with Water, it ſhould not be barely ſaid but
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94784:77"/>
prov'd, which he will not perhaps think eaſie to be done, that conſiders how vaſt a quantity of fair Water is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to be exhal'd away, to obtain as much as one Ounce of dry Reſidents, whether Saline or Earthy.</p>

                  <p>That a Plant, growing in the Earth, doth by the faculties of its Vegetative Soul attract the Juices of the Earth, that are within its reach, and ſelecting thoſe parts that are congruous to its Nature, refuſe the reſt, is the general Opinion of Philoſophers, and Phyſicians: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many Naturaliſts are not wont much to marvail, when they ſee a Tree bear a Fruit that is ſowr or bitter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they preſume, that Nature hath in the Root of the Tree cull'd out ſuch parts of the Alimental Juice of the Earth, as being made to convene into one Fruit, are fit to make it of ſuch a Quality. But 'tis worth obſerving for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94784:78"/>
our preſent purpoſe what happens both in ordinary Graftings, and eſpecially in that kind of Inſition (taking the word in a large ſenſe) which is commonly call'd Inoculation. For though we may preſume, that the Root of a white Thorne (for Inſtance) may electively attract its Aliment from the Earth, and chooſe that which is fitteſt to produce the Ignoble fruit, that is proper for that Plant: yet we cannot reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that it ſhould in its attraction of Aliment have any Deſigne of providing an Appropriate Nutriment for a Pore, and yet the known Experience of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diners, and our own Obſervations mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the Cyons of a Pear tree will take very well upon a White thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock, and bring forth a well taſted fruit, very differing in many qualities from that of the White thorn. I have alſo learn'd from thoſe that are expert, That though Apples and Pears, being but Vulgar Fruit, are ſeldome propagated
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:94784:78"/>
but by Grafting; yet they may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated likewiſe by Inoculation, (which ſeems to be but a kind of Grafting with a Bud.) Now in the Inoculations, that are made upon Fruit trees, tis very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, and may much countenance what we are endeavouring to prove, that a little Vegetable Bud, (that is no Seed, properly ſo call'd,) not ſo big often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as a Pea, ſhould be able ſo to tranſmute all the Sap that arrives at it, that though this Sap be already in the Root, and in its paſſage upwards deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by Natures Intention, as Men are wont to ſpeak, to the production of the Fruit that is natural to the Stock; yet this Sap ſhould by ſo ſmall a Vegetable Subſtance as a Bud, (whether by the help of ſome peculiar kind of Strainer, or by the Operation of ſome powerful Ferment lodged in it, or by both theſe, or ſome other cauſe,) be ſo far chang'd and overrul'd, as to conſtitute a Fruit quite otherwiſe qualify'd, then that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:94784:79"/>
which is the Genuine production of the Tree, and which is actually produc'd by thoſe other portions of the like Sap, which happen'd to nouriſh the prolific'd Buds that are the Genuine Of-ſpring of the Stock; ſo that the ſame Sap, that in one part of a Branch conſtitutes (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) a Cluſter of Haws, in another part of the ſame Branch may conſtitute a Pear. And that which is further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable to our preſent purpoſe, is, That not onely the Fruites made of the ſame Sap do often differ from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Shape, Bigneſs, Colour, Odour, Taſt, and other obvious Qualities, as well as Occult ones: but that though the Sap it ſelf be (oftentimes) a Wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and almoſt Inſipid Liquor, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to ſenſe Homogeneous enough, and even by Diſtillation affords very little beſides Flegme; yet this Sap is not onely convertible by Buds of ſeveral Natures into differing Fruits, but in one and the ſame Fruit the tranſmuted Sap
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94784:79"/>
ſhall by differing Textures be made to exhibit very differing, and ſometimes contrary Qualities. As when (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) a Peach bud does not onely change the Sap that comes to it into a Fruit, very differing from that which the Stock naturally produceth, but in the Skin of the Peach it muſt be red, in the Kernel white, and in other parts of other Colours; the Fleſh of it muſt be fragrant, the Stone inodorous, the Fleſh ſoft and yielding, the Stone very hard and brittle, the Meat pleaſantly taſted, the Kernel bitter; not to mention, that Peach Bloſſoms, though produc'd alſo by the Bud, are of a Colour and Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture very differing from that of the Fruit, and are enobled with an Occult Quality, which the Fruit hath not, I mean a Purgative Virtue: So that from Inoculations we may learn, That a ſteg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Liquor, that ſeems Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough, &amp; but very ſlenderly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with other manifeſt Qualities then
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94784:80"/>
common water, may, by being variouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contexted by the Buds of Trees, be tranſmuted into Bodies endow'd with new, and various, and conſiderable Sents, Colours, Taſts, Solidity, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal vertues, and divers other Qualities manifeſt, and occult.</p>
                  <p>If it be here ſaid, that theſe Qualities are the productions of the Plaſtick Power reſiding in prolifick Buds, which indeed (to me) ſeem to be but very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Boughs; I ſhall return the ſame Anſwer that I did to the like Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when 'twas propoſ'd in the Firſt Obſervation.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have onely argued from vulgar Inoculations, but there may be others, as well more conſiderable, as leſſe ordinary; and I remember I have ſeen a Tree, whereof, though the Stock was of one ſort of good Fruit, there were three more and differing kinds of Stone-fruit, that had been made to take by Inoculation; and two of thoſe inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94784:80"/>
Boughs had actually Fruit on them, and the third, though it had as yet no Fruit, becauſe the Seaſon for that ſort of Plants to bear it was not yet come, yet the Shoot was ſo flouriſhing, that we concluded, that the Bloſſoms would in due time be ſucceeded by fruit. And ſince I have been ſpeaking of the differing Qualities of the parts of the ſame Fruit, I am content to adde two things: the one that <hi>Garcias ab Horto,</hi> a Claſſick Author, (and Phyſician to the Indian Viceroy) affirmes <note n="*" place="bottom">Aromat.

I ſay, the <hi>Modern</hi> Ariſtotelians, becauſe diverſe of the <hi>Antient,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Greek</hi> Commentators of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſeem to have underſtood their Maſters Doctrine of Forms much otherwiſe, and leſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruouſly, then his Latin followers, the Schoolmen and others, have ſince done. Nor do I expreſly mention <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> himſelf among the Champions of ſubſtantial Forms, becauſe though he ſeem in a place or two expreſly enough
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94784:85"/>
to reckon Formes among <hi>Subſtances,</hi> yet elſewhere the Examples he imploies to ſet forth the <hi>Forms</hi> of Natural things by, being taken from the <hi>Figures</hi> of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial things, (as of a Statue, &amp;c.) which are confeſſedly but <hi>Accidents,</hi> and making very little uſe, if any, of Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Forms to explain the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, He ſeems to me upon the whole matter, either to have been irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, whether there were any ſuch Subſtances, or no, or to ſpeak ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and obſcurely enough of them, to make it queſtionable, what his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them were.</p>
               <p>But the ſumme of the Controverſy betwixt Us and the Schools is this, whether or no the Forms of Natural things, (the Souls of Men alwaies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) be in Generation <hi>educed,</hi> as they ſpeak, <hi>out of the power of the Matter,</hi> and whether theſe Forms be true <hi>ſubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Entities,</hi> diſtinct from the other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Principle of Natural Bodies, namely Matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:94784:86"/>The Reaſons that move me to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Negative, are principally theſe three. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That I ſee no neceſſity of admitting in Natural things any ſuch ſubſtantial Forms, Matter and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of Matter being ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate as much of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, as we either do or are like to underſtand. <hi>The next,</hi> That I ſee not what uſe this puzling Doctrine of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Forms is of in Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; the Acute <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and thoſe that have moſt buſied themſelves in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagation of them, having freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, (as the more Candid of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks generally do,) That the true Knowledg of Forms is too difficult and abſtruſe to be attain'd by them. And how like it is, that particular <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> will be explain'd by a Principal, whoſe Nature is confeſſedly ignor'd, I leave you to judg: but becauſe to theſe conſiderations I often have had, and ſhall have here and there occaſion to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94784:86"/>
ſay ſomething in the body of theſe Notes, I ſhall at preſent inſiſt upon the <hi>third,</hi> which is, That I cannot conceive, neither how Forms can be generated, as the Peripateticks would have it, nor how the things, they aſcribe to them, are conſiſtent with the Principles of true Philoſophy, or even with what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves otherwiſe teach.</p>
               <p>The Manner how Forms are educed out of the Power of the Matter, according to that part of the Doctrine of Forms, wherein the Schools generally enough agree, is a thing ſo Inexplicable, that I wonder not it hath put Acute men upon ſeveral <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> to make it out. And indeed the number of Theſe is of late grown too great to be fit to be here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, eſpecially ſince I find them all ſo very unſatisfactory, that I cannot but think, the acute Sticklers for any of them are rather driven to embrace it by the palpable inconveniences of the wayes they reject, then by any thing
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:94784:87"/>
they find to ſatisfy them, in that which they make choice of: and for my part I confeſs, I find ſo much Reaſon in what each Party ſayes againſt the Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the reſt, that I think they all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute well, and none does well Eſtabliſh.</p>
               <p>But my preſent way of Writing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding me to inſiſt on many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the Doctrine, where they moſt agree, I ſhall onely urge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That which I confeſs chiefly ſticks with me, namely that I find it not <hi>Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know the Modern Schoolmen fly here to their wonted Refuge of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcure Diſtinction, and tell us, that the Power of Matter in reference to Forms is partly Eductive, as the Agent ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94784:87"/>
'tis hard to conceive, how a Subſtance can be educ'd out of another Subſtance totally diſtinct in Nature from it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being, before ſuch Eduction, actually exiſtent in it. And as for the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power of the Matter, That but fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to receive or lodge a Form, when brought to be United with it, how can it be intelligibly made out to contribute to the Production of a new Subſtance, of a quite differing Nature from that Matter, though it harbours it when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd? And 'tis plain, that the Humane Body hath a receptive Power in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Humane Soule, which yet themſelves confeſs both to be a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Form, and not to be educ'd out of the Power of Matter.

Wine, becauſe then not onely Matter will be corruptible againſt their grounds, but Matter and Form would not be two differing and ſubſtantial Principles, but one and the ſame, though diverſify'd by firmneſs, and groſſeneſs, &amp;c. which are but Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal differences. I know they ſpeak much of the efficacy of the Agent upon the Matter, in the Generation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Bodies, and tell us ſtrange things of his manner of working. But not to ſpend time in examining thoſe obſcure niceties, I anſwer in ſhort; That ſince the Agent, be he what he will, is but a Phyſical and finite Agent, and ſince what way ſoever he works, he can do nothing repugnant to the nature of things, the difficulty, that ſticks with me, will ſtill remain. For if the Form produc'd in Generation, be, as they would have it, a Subſtance, that was not before to be found any where out of that portion of Matter, wherewith it

of any thing that is Material, they muſt give me leave to believe, that tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd out of Nothing, till they ſhew me, how a Subſtance can be produc'd other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that exiſted no where before. And at this rate every Natural Body of a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Denomination, as Gold, Marble, Nitre, &amp;c. muſt not be produc'd barely by Generation, but partly by Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and partly by Creation. And ſince tis confeſſ'd on all ſides, that no Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Agent can produce the leaſt Atome of Matter, tis ſtrange they ſhould in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration allow every Phyſical Agent the power of producing a Form, which, according to them, is not onely a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but a far nobler one then Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and thereby attribute to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Creatures that power of creating Subſtances, which the Antient Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts thought too great to be aſcrib'd to God himſelf, and which indeed is too great to be aſcrib'd to any other then Him, and therefore ſome Schoolmen
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94784:90"/>
and Philoſophers have deriv'd Forms immediately from God; but this is not onely to deſert <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick Philoſophy they would ſeem to maintain, but to put Omnipotence upon working I know not how many thouſand Miracles every hour, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that (I mean the Generation of Bodies of new Denominations) in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural way, which ſeems the moſt familiar effect of Nature in her ordinary courſe.</p>
               <p>And as the Production of Forms out of the Power of Matter is for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons incomprehenſible to me, ſo thoſe things, which the Peripateticks aſcribe to their ſubſtantial Forms, are ſome of them ſuch, as, I confeſſe, I cannot recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile my Reaſon to: for they tell us poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that theſe Forms are Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and yet at the ſame time they teach, that they depend upon Matter, both <hi>in fieri</hi> and <hi>in eſſe,</hi> as they ſpeak, ſo that out of the Matter, that ſupports them,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94784:90"/>
they cannot ſo much as exiſt, (whence they are uſually call'd Material Forms,) which is to make them Subſtances in name, and but Accidents in truth: for not to ask how (among Phyſical things) one Subſtance can be ſaid to depend upon another <hi>in fieri,</hi> that is not made of any part of it, that very notion of a Subſtance is to be a ſelf-ſubſiſting Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or that which needs no other Created Being to ſupport it, or to make it exiſt. Beſides that, there being but two ſorts of Subſtances, Material, and Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, a ſubſtantial Form muſt appertain to one of the two, and yet they aſcribe things to it, that make it very unfit to be referr'd to either. To all this I adde, that theſe imaginary Material Forms do almoſt as much trouble the Doctrine of Corruption, as that of Generation: for if a Form be a true Subſtance really diſtinct from Matter, it muſt, as I lately noted, be able to exiſt of it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Subſtance to ſupport it;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94784:91"/>
as thoſe I reaſon with confeſs, that the Soul of Man ſurvives the Body, it did before Death inform: whereas they will have it, that in Corruption the Form is quite aboliſh'd, and utterly periſhes, as not being capable of exiſting, ſeparated from the Matter, whereunto it was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: ſo that here again, what they call a Subſtance they make indeed an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and beſides contradict their own vulgar Doctrine, That Natural things are upon their Corruption reſolv'd into the firſt Matter, ſince at this rate they ſhould ſay, that ſuch things are but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolv'd into the firſt Matter, and partly either into Nothing, or into Forms, which being as well immaterial as the Souls of Men, muſt, for ought appears, be alſo, like them, accounted immortal.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now examine thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that are wont to be imploy'd by the Schools to evince their ſubſtantial Forms, but, beſides that the nature and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94784:91"/>
ſcope of my preſent Work injoynes me Brevity, I confeſſe that, one or two excepted, the Arguments I have found mention'd, as the chief, are rather Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical, or Logical, then grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Principles and <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, and reſpect rather Words then Things, and therefore I, who have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclination, nor leaſure, to wrangle about Terms, ſhall content my ſelf to propoſe, and very briefly anſwer two or three of thoſe that are thought the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt then they thus argue. <hi>Omne Compoſitum ſubſtantiale</hi> (for it is hard to Engliſh well ſuch Uncouth Terms) <hi>requirit materiam &amp; formam ſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, ex quibus componatur. Omne corpus naturale eſt compoſitu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſubſtantiale. Ergo</hi> &amp;c. In this Syllogiſme ſome do plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly enough deny the Conſequence, but for brevities ſake, I ſhall rather chooſe to deny the Minor, and deſire the Propoſers to prove it. For I know
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94784:92"/>
not any thing in Nature that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd of Matter, and a Subſtance diſtinct from Matter, except Man, who alone is made up of an immaterial Form, and a humane Body; and if it be urg'd, that then other Bodies cannot be properly ſaid to be <hi>Compoſita ſubſtantialia</hi>: I ſhall, rather then wrangle with them, give them leave to find out ſome other name for other Natural things.</p>
               <p>But then they argue in the next place, that, if there were no ſubſtantial Forms, all Bodies would be but <hi>Entia per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> as they ſpeak, which is abſurd. To which I anſwer, That in the Notion, that divers Learned men have of an <hi>Ens per Accidens,</hi> namely, that tis That which conſiſts of thoſe things, <hi>quae non ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantur ad unum,</hi> it may be ſaid, That though we do not admit ſubſtantial Forms, yet we need not admit Natural Bodies to be <hi>Entia per accidens</hi>; becauſe in them the ſeveral things that concur to conſtitute the Body, as Matter,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94784:92"/>
Shape, Scituation, and Motion, <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantur per ſe &amp; intrinſecè</hi> to conſtitute one Natural Body. But, if this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſatisfie not, I ſhall adde, that for my part, That which I am ſollicitous about, is, what Nature hath made things to be in themſelves, not what a Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian or Metaphyſician will call them in the Terms of his Art; it being much fitter in my judgment to alter Words, that they may better fit the Nature of Things, then to affix a wrong Nature to Things, that they may be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to forms of Words, that were probably deviſ'd, when the things themſelves were not known or vvell underſtood, if at all thought on.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I ſhall but adde one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument more of this ſort, and That is, that, if there vvere no ſubſtantial Forms, neither could there be any ſubſtantial Definitions, but the Conſequent is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and therefore ſo is the Antecedent. To vvhich I reply, that ſince the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:94784:93"/>
themſelves confeſs the Forms of Bodies to be of themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, all that this Argument ſeems to me to conclude, is but this, <hi>That</hi> if we do not admit ſomethings, that are not <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> we cannot build our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions upon them: nor indeed could we, if we ſhould admit ſubſtantial Forms, give ſubſtantial Definitions of Natural things, unleſſe we could alſo define Natural Bodies by things that we know not; for ſuch <note n="*" place="bottom">Nego tibi uil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe three Arguments, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> for ſubſtantial Forms, You may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as well as I, find variouſly propoſ'd, and perhaps with ſome light alterations multiply'd in the writings of the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks and Schoolmen; but all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of this kind that I have met with, may, if I miſtake not, be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſolv'd by the Anſwers we have given to theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or at leaſt by the grounds upon which thoſe Anſwers are built; thoſe ſeemingly various Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in this, That <hi>either</hi> they reſpect rather Words then Things, <hi>or</hi> that they are grounded upon precarious Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>or</hi> laſtly that they urge That as an Abſurdity, which, whether it be one or not in thoſe, that admit the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Philoſophy, to me, that do as little acquieſce in many of their other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as I do in their ſubſtantial Forms, doth not appear any Abſurdity at all. And tis perhaps for fear that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94784:94"/>
of this ſort ſhould not much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with Naturaliſts, that ſome of the Modern aſſertors of the Forms we que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, have thought it requiſite to adde ſome more Phyſical Arguments, which (though I have not found them all in the ſame Writers, yet) being in all but few, I ſhall here briefly conſider them.</p>
               <p>Firſt then among the Phyſical Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that are brought to prove ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Forms, I find That the moſt confidently inſiſted on, which is taken from the ſpontaneous return of heated Water to Coldneſs, which Effects, ſay they, muſt neceſſarily be aſcrib'd to the Action of the ſubſtantial Form, whoſe office it is to preſerve the Body in its Natural ſtate, and, when there is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to reduce it thereunto: and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument indeed might be plauſible, if we were ſure, that heated Water would grow cold again (without the Avolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any Parts more agitated then the reſt,) ſuppoſing it to be remov'd into
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94784:94"/>
ſome of the imaginary ſpaces beyond the World; but as the caſe is, I ſee no neceſſity of ſlying to a ſubſtantial Form, the Matter ſeeming to be eaſily explicable otherwiſe. The Water we heat is ſurrounded with our Air, or with ſome Veſſel, or other Body contiguous to the Air, and both the Air and the Water in theſe Climates are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly leſſe agitated, then the Juices in our hands, or other Organs of Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which makes us eſteem and call thoſe Fluids, cold. Now when the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is expoſ'd to the fire, it is thereby put into a new Agitation, more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then that of the parts of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory, which you will eaſily grant, if you conſider, that when the Heat is intenſe, it makes the Water boyl and ſmoak, and oftentimes run over the Veſſel; but when the Liquor is remov'd from the fire, this acquir'd Agitation muſt needs by degrees be loſt, <hi>either</hi> by the avola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch fiery Corpuſcles as the

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:94784:96"/>
to preſerve it, and out of which it cannot be put, but by being put into a Praeternatural ſtate. For the World being once conſtituted by the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Things, as it now is, I look upon the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature to be cauſ'd by the Local Motion of one part of Matter hitting againſt another, and am not ſo fully convinc'd, that there is ſuch a thing, as Natures deſigning to keep ſuch a parcel of Matter in ſuch a ſtate, that is cloth'd with juſt ſuch Accidents, rather then with any other. But I look upon many Bodies, eſpecially fluid ones, as frequently changing their ſtate, according as they happen to be more or leſſe agitated, or otherwiſe wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Sun, and other conſiderable Agents in Nature. As the Air, Water, and other Fluids, if the temperature as to Cold or Heat, and Rarefaction or Condenſation, which they are in at the beginning of the Spring here at <hi>London,</hi> be pitcht upon as their Natural ſtate,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94784:97"/>
then not onely in the torrid and frozen Zones they muſt have other and very differing Natural ſtates, but here it ſelf they will, almoſt all the Summer and all the Winter, as our Weather Glaſſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, be in a varying Praeternatural ſtate, becauſe they will be in thoſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons either more hot and rarify'd, or more cold and condenſ'd, then in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Spring. And in more ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and conſtant Bodies I take, in many caſes, the Natural ſtate to be but either <hi>the moſt uſual state,</hi> or <hi>That, wherein that, which produces a notable Change in them, finds them.</hi> As when a ſlender piece of Silver, that is moſt commonly flexible, and will ſtand bent every way, comes to be well hammer'd, I count that Flexibility to be the Natural ſtate of that Mettal, becauſe moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Silver is found to be flexible, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſo before it was hammer'd; but the Springineſſe it acquires by ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering is a ſtate, which is properly no
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94784:97"/>
more unnatural to the Silver then the other, and would continue with the Mettal as long as It, if both pieces of Silver, the one flexible, the other ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, were let alone, and kept from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward violence: And as the Silver, to be depriv'd of its flexibleneſs, needed the violent Motion of the Hammer, ſo to deprive it of its Spring, it needs the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Agitation of a nealing fire. Theſe things, and much more, I might here repreſent, but to come cloſe to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, I Anſwer, That the Accidents ſpoken of are introduced into the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the Agents or Efficient Cauſes, whatever they be, that produce in it what, in the ſenſe formerly explain'd, we call an <hi>eſſential</hi> (though not a <hi>ſubſtantial</hi>) Form. And theſe Accidents being once thus introduc'd into the Matter, we need not ſeek for a new ſubſtantial Principle to preſerve them there, ſince by the general law, or common courſe of Nature, the Matter qualify'd by
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94784:98"/>
them, muſt continue in the ſtate ſuch Accidents have put it into, till, by ſome Agent or other, it be forcibly put out of it, and ſo diveſted of thoſe Accidents; as in the formerly mention'd Example, borrow'd from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> of a Brazen Sphaere, when once the Motion of Tools, impell'd and guided by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, have turn'd a piece of Braſs into a Sphaere, there needs no new Subſtance to preſerve that round figure, ſince the Braſſe muſt retain it, till it be deſtroy'd by the Artificer himſelf, or ſome other Agent able to overcome the reſiſtance of the Matter, to be put into another figure. And on this occaſion let me confirme this <hi>ad hominem,</hi> by repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, That there is not an inconſiderable Party among the Peripateticks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who maintain, That in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Firſt Qualities (as they call them) are inſtead of Forms, and that the Fire (for inſtance) hath no other Form then Heat and Dryneſſe, and the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94784:98"/>
Water then Coldneſſe and Moiſture. Now if theſe Bodies, that are the vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and the moſt important of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary World, conſiſt but of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Matter, and the few Accidents; and if in theſe there needs no ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Form to keep the Qualities of the Matter united to it, and conjoyn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, and preſerve them in that ſtate, as long as the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires, though beſides the four Qualities that are call'd <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have divers others, as Gravity and Levity, Firmneſſe and Fluidity, Opacouſneſſe and Tranſparency, &amp;c. why ſhould the favourers of this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deny, That, in other Bodies beſides the Elements, Qualities may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd and kept united to the Matter they belong to, without the Band or Support of a ſubſtantial Form? And as, when there is no competent deſtructive Cauſe, the Accidents of a Body will by the Law of Nature remain ſuch as they
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94784:99"/>
were, ſo if there be, it cannot with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be pretended, that the ſubſtantial Form is able to preſerve all thoſe Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of a Body, that are ſaid to ſlow from it, and to be as it were under its care and tuition; for if, for inſtance, you expoſe a Sphaere or Bullet of Lead to a ſtrong fire, it will quickly looſe (not to mention its Figure) both its Coldneſs, its Conſiſtence, its Malleableneſs, its Colour, (for 'twill appear of the colour of fire,) its Flexibility, and ſome other Qualities, and all this in ſpight of the imaginary ſubſtantial Form, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Peripatetical Principles, in this caſe muſt ſtill remain in it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to help it. And though upon the taking the Lead from off the fire, it is wont to be reduc'd to moſt of its former Qualities, (for it will not of it ſelf recover its Sphaericity,) yet That may well be aſcrib'd partly to its peculiar Texture, and partly to the Coldneſs of the ambient Air, according to what we
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94784:99"/>
lately diſcourſ'd touching heated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerated Water, which Temperature of the Air is an extrinſecal thing to the Lead, and indeed it is but Accidental, that the Lead upon refrigeration regains its former Qualities; for in caſe the Lead have been expoſ'd long enough to a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently intenſe fire, it will (as we have purpoſely try'd) be turn'd into Glaſſe, and looſe its colour, its opacity, its mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leableneſs, and (former degree of) flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, and acquire a Reddiſhneſs, a degree of Tranſparency, a Brittleneſſe, and ſome other Qualities, that it had not before: and let the ſuppoſed ſubſtantial Form do what it can, even when the Veſſel is remov'd from the fire, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce or reſtore the Body to its Natural ſtate and Accidents, yet the former Qualities will remain loſt, as long as theſe Praeternatural ones, introduc'd by the fire, continue in the Matter; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one will be reſtor'd, nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſtroy'd, till ſome ſufficiently
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94784:100"/>
powerful extrinſick Agent effect the Change. And on the other ſide I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the Fruit, when ſever'd from the Tree it grew on, is confeſſ'd to be no longer animated (at leaſt the Kernels or Seeds excepted) by the Vegetative Soul, or ſubſtantial Form of the Plant; yet in an Orange or Lemmon (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) pluckt from the Tree, we ſee, that the ſame Colour, the ſame Odour, the ſame Taſt, the ſame Figure, the ſame Conſiſtence, and, for ought we know, the ſame other Qualities, whether ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, or even occult, as are its Antido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and Antiſcorbutical virtues, that muſt before be ſaid to have flow'd from the Soul of the Tree, will continue, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny months, perhaps ſome years, after the fruit has ceaſ'd to have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the Tree, (nay though the Tree, whereon it grew, be perhaps in the mean time hewn down or burnt, and though conſequently its Vegetative Soul or Form be deſtroy'd,) as when it
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94784:100"/>
grew thereon, and made up one Plant with it. And we find, that Tamarinds, Rhubarb, Senna, and many other Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will for divers years, after they have been depriv'd of their former Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Soul, retain their Purgative and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Specifick properties.</p>
               <p>I find it likewiſe urg'd, that there can be no Reaſon, why Whiteneſs ſhould be ſeparable from a Wall, and not from Snow or Milk; unleſſe we have recourſe to ſubſtantial Forms. But in caſe men have agreed to call a thing by ſuch a name, becauſe it has ſuch a particular Quality, that differences it from others, we need go no farther to find a Reaſon, why one Quality is eſſential to one thing, and not to another. As in our former example of a Braſs Sphaere, the Figure is that, for which we give it that Name, and therefore, though you may alter the figure of the Matter, yet by that very alteration the Body periſhes in the capacity of a Sphaere, whereas its
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94784:101"/>
Coldneſs may be exchang'd for Heat, without the making it the leſs a Sphaere, becauſe tis not for any ſuch Quality, but for Roundneſs, that a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is ſaid to be a Sphaere. And ſo Firmneſs is an inſeparable Quality of Ice, though this or that particular Figure be not, becauſe that tis for want of fluidity, that any thing, that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before a Liquor, is call'd Ice, and congruouſly hereunto, though Whiteneſs were inſeparable from Snow and Milk, yet that would not neceſſarily infer, that there muſt be a ſubſtantial Form to make it ſo: for the Firmneſs of the Corpuſcles, that compoſe Snow, is as inſeparable from it, as the Whiteneſſe; and yet is not pretended to be the effect of the ſubſtantial Form of the Water, but of the exceſſe of the Coldneſſe of the Air, which (to uſe vulgar, though perhaps unaccurate, expreſſions,) puts the Water out of its Natural ſtate of Fluidity, and into a Praeternatural one
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94784:101"/>
Firmneſs and Brittleneſs. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why Snow ſeldome looſes its white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but with its nature, ſeems to be, that its component Particles are ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd, that the ſame heat of the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Air, that is ſit to turn it into a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Body, is alſo fit to make it a flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id one, which when it is become, we no longer call it Snow, but Water; ſo that the Water looſes its whiteneſs, though the Snow do not. But if there be a cauſe proper to make a convenient alteration of Texture in the Snow, without mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or reſolving it into water, it may then exchange its Whiteneſs for Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſſe, without looſing its right to be call'd Snow; as, I remember, I have read in an eminent Writer, that <hi>de facto</hi> in the Northern Regions towards the Pole, thoſe parcels of Snow, that have lain very long on the ground, degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in time into a Yellowiſh colour, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry differing from that pure Whiteneſs to be obſerv'd in the neighbouring
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94784:102"/>
Snow lately fallen.</p>
               <p>But there yet remains an Argument for ſubſtantial Forms, which though (perhaps becauſe Phyſical) wont to be overlook'd, or ſlightly anſwer'd by their Oppoſers, will for the ſame reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be taken notice of here; and it is, That there ſeems to be a neceſſity of admitting ſubſtantial Forms in Bodies, that from thence we may derive all the various changes, to which they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the differing Effects they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, [the Preſervation and Reſtitution of the State requiſite to each particular Body,] as alſo the keeping of its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts united into one <hi>Totum.</hi> To the anſwering of this Argument, ſo many things will be found applicable, both in the paſt and ſubſequent parts of theſe Notes, that I ſhall at preſent but point the chief particulars, on which the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is grounded.</p>
               <p>I conſider then firſt, that many and great Alterations may happen to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94784:102"/>
which ſeem manifeſtly to proceed from their peculiar Texture, and the Action of outward Agents upon them, and of which it cannot be ſhewn, that they would happen otherwiſe, though there were no ſubſtantial Forms <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum natura</hi>: as we ſee that Tallow (for inſtance) being melted by the fire looſes its Coldneſs, Firmneſs, and its White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and acquires Heat, Fluidity, and ſome Tranſparency, all which, being ſuffer'd to cool, it preſently exchanges for the three firſt nam'd Qualities. And yet divers of theſe Changes are plainly enough the effects partly of the Fire, partly of the ambient Air, and not of I know not what ſubſtantial Form: and it is both evident and remarkable, what great variety of changes in Qualities, and Productions of new ones, the Fire (that is, a Body conſiſting of inſenſible parts, that are variouſly and vehemently mov'd) doth effect by its Heat, that is, <hi>by a modify'd Local Motion.</hi> I conſider
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94784:103"/>
further, that various Operations of a Body may be deriv'd from the peculiar Texture of the Whole, and the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Affections of the particular Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles or other parts that compoſe it, as we have often occaſion to declare here and there in this Treatiſe; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by an Inſtance, ere long to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſiſted on, namely, that though Vitriol, made of Iron with a Corroſive liquor, be but a factitious Body, made by a convenient appoſition of the ſmall parts of the ſaline Menſtruum to thoſe of the Mettal, yet this Vitriol will do moſt, if not all, of the ſame things, that Vitriol, made by Nature in the bowels of the Earth, and digg'd out thence, will perform; and each of theſe Bodies may be endow'd with variety of differing Qualities, which I ſee not, why they muſt flow, in the native Vitriol, from a ſubſtantial Form, ſince in the factitious Vitriol, the ſame Qualities belong to a Form, that does plainly emerge from
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94784:103"/>
the coalition of Metalline and Saline Corpuſcles, aſſociated together and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd of after a certain manner.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, as to what is very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, as well as plauſibly, pretended, That a ſubſtantial Form is requiſite to keep the parts of a Body united, without which it would not be one Body. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That the contrivance of conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently figur'd parts, and in ſome caſes their juxta-poſition, may without the aſſiſtance of a ſubſtantial Form be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for this matter; for not to repeat what I juſt now mention'd concerning Vitriol made by Art, whoſe Parts are as well united and kept together, as thoſe of the Native Vitriol, I obſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a Pear grafted upon a Thorn, or a Plum inoculated upon an Apricock, will bear good fruit, and grow up with the Stock, as though they both made but one Tree, and were animated but by the ſame common Form; whereas indeed both the Stock and the inoculated or

               <p>Now for our Doctrine touching the Origine of Forms, it will not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to collect it from what we former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcourſ'd about Qualities and Forms together: for the Form of a Natural Body, being according to us, but an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Modification, and, as it were, the <hi>Stamp</hi> of its Matter, or ſuch a conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bigneſs, Shape, Motion (or Reſt,) Scituation and Contexture, (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the thence reſulting Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) of the ſmall parts that compoſe the Body, as is neceſſary to conſtitute and denominate ſuch a particular Body; and all theſe Accidents being produci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Matter by Local Motion, 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> to ſay, That the firſt and Univerſal, though not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſe of Forms is none other but God, who <hi>put Matter into Motion,</hi> (which belongs not to its Eſſence,) and <hi>Establiſh'd the Laws of Motion</hi> amongſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94784:108"/>
Bodies, and alſo, according to my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>guided it in divers caſes at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Things</hi>; and that, among Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes, the Grand Efficient of Forms is <hi>Local Motion,</hi> which by vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly dividing, ſequeſtring, tranſpoſing, and ſo connecting the parts of Matter, produces in them thoſe Accidents and Qualities, upon whoſe account the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Matter they diverſifie comes to belong to this or that determinate <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of Natural Bodies, which yet is not ſo to be underſtood, as if <hi>Motion</hi> were onely an Efficient cauſe in the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bodies, but very often (as in, water, fire, &amp;c.) tis alſo one of the chiefe <hi>Accidents,</hi> that concurre to make up the Form.</p>

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94784:109"/>
interpoſe for the Production of Things Corporeal, nor even of Plants or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which according to him are but Engines: I do not at all believe, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe <hi>Carteſian Laws of Motion,</hi> or the <hi>Epicurean caſual Concourſe</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, could bring meer Matter into ſo orderly and well contriv'd a Fabrick as This World; and therefore I think, that the wiſe Author of Nature did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>put Matter into Motion,</hi> but when he reſolv'd to make the World, did ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate and <hi>guide the Motions</hi> of the ſmall parts of the Univerſal Matter, as to reduce the greater Syſtems of them into the Order they were to continue in; and did more particularly contrive ſome portions of that Matter into Seminal Rudiments or Principles, lodg'd in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Receptacles, (and as it were Wombs,) and others into the Bodies of Plants and Animals: one main part of whoſe Contrivance, did, as I apprehend, conſiſt in this, That ſome of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94784:109"/>
were ſo fram'd, that, ſuppoſing the Fabrick of the greater Bodies of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe, and the Laws he had eſtabliſh'd in Nature, ſome Juicy and Spirituous parts of theſe living Creatures muſt be fit to be turn'd into Prolifick Seeds, whereby they may have a power, by generating their like, to propagate their <hi>Species.</hi> So that according to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, it was <hi>at the beginning</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that an Intelligent and Wiſe Agent ſhould contrive the Univerſal Matter into the World, (and eſpecially ſome Portions of it into Seminal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Principles,) and ſettle the Laws, according to which the Motions and Actions of its parts upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould be regulated: without which interpoſition of the Worlds Architect, however <hi>moving Matter</hi> may with ſome <hi>probability</hi> (for I ſee not in the Notion any Certainty) be conceiv'd to be able, after numberleſs Occurſions of its inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible parts, to caſt it ſelf into ſuch

of its parts, as other Bodies that are ſaid to be endow'd therewith.

                  <p>IT was not at randome, that I ſpoke, when, in the foregoing Notes about the Origine of Qualities, I intimated, That 'twas very much by a kind of tacit agreement, that Men had diſtinguiſh'd the <hi>Species</hi> of Bodies, and that thoſe Diſtinctions were more Arbitrary then we are wont to be aware of. For I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that I have not yet, either in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> or any other Writer, met with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny genuine and ſufficient Diagnoſtick and Boundary, for the Diſcriminating

and limiting the <hi>Species</hi> of Things, or to ſpeak more plainly, I have not found, that any Naturaliſt has laid down a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Number and ſort of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or other Attributes, which is <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> to conſtitute all por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Matter, endow'd with them, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Kinds of Natural Bodies. And therefore I obſerve, that moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Men look upon theſe as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct <hi>Species</hi> of Bodies, that have had the luck to have diſtinct Names found out for them; though perhaps diverſe of them differ much leſſe from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then other Bodies, which (becauſe they have been hudled up under one Name,) have been look'd upon, as but one ſort of Bodies. But not to lay any weight on this Intimation about Names, I found, that for want of a true Characteriſtick, or diſcriminating notes, it hath been, and is ſtill, both very <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain</hi> as to divers Bodies, whether they are of different <hi>Species</hi> or of the ſame,

which Doctrine is favour'd by the differing Qualities of Ice and Water, for not onely the one is fluid, and the other ſolid, and even brittle, but Ice is alſo commonly more or leſs opacous in compariſon of Water, being alſo ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then it <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> ſince it ſwims up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. To which may be added, that Ice, beaten with common Salt, will freez other Bodies, when Water mingled with Salt will not.

                  <p>As for what may be objected, that we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt Factitious Bodies and Natural, I will not now ſtay to examine, how far that Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be allow'd: for it may ſuffice for our preſent purpoſe to repreſent, that whatever may be ſaid of Factitious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, where Man does, by Inſtruments of his own providing, onely give Figure, or alſo Contexture to the <hi>ſenſible</hi> (not inſenſible) parts of the Matter he works upon; as when a Joyner makes a Stool, or a Statuary makes an Image, or a Turner a Bowl: yet the caſe may be very differing in thoſe other factitious Productions, wherein the <hi>inſenſible</hi> parts of Matter are alter'd by Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, who perform the greateſt part of the work among themſelves, though the Artificer be an Aſſiſtant, by putting Them together after a due manner. And therefore I know not, why all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94784:116"/>
of the Fire made by Chymiſts ſhould be look'd upon, as not Natural, but Artificial Bodies: ſince the Fire, which is the grand Agent in theſe Changes, doth not, by being imploy'd by the Chymiſt, ceaſe to be, and to work as, a Natural Agent. And ſince Nature her ſelf doth, by the help of the fire, ſometimes afford us the like Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions that the Alchymiſts art pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us: as in <hi>Aetna, Veſuvius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burning Mountains, (ſome of whoſe Productions I can ſhew you,) Stones are ſometimes turn'd into Lime, (and ſo an Alcalizate Salt is produc'd,) and ſometimes, if they be more diſpoſ'd to be flux'd, then calcin'd, brought to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trification; Metalline and Mineral Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are by the violence of the fire colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated into Maſſes of very ſtrange and compounded Natures. Aſhes and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline flowers of divers kinds are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd about the neighbouring places, and copious flowers of Sulphur, ſublim'd
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94784:117"/>
by the internal fire, have been ſeveral times found about the Vents, at which the Fumes are diſcharg'd into the Air: (As I have been aſſur'd by Ingenious Viſiters of ſuch Places, whom I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely inquir'd of, touching theſe <hi>ſtores</hi>; for of theſe Travellers more then one anſwer'd me, they had themſelves ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd, and had brought ſome very good.) Not to adde, that I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuſpected, upon no abſurd grounds, that divers of the Minerals and other Bodies, we meet with in the lower parts of the Earth, and think to have been formed and lodg'd there ever ſince the beginning of Things, have been ſince produc'd there by the help of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal fires, or other heats, which may <hi>either</hi> by their immediate action, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly long application, very much alter ſome Bodies by changing their Texture; as when Lead is turn'd into Minium, and Tin into Putty by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the fire in a few hours, <hi>or</hi> by
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94784:117"/>
elevating, in the form of Exhalations or Vapours, divers Saline and Sulphureous Corpuſcles or Particles of unripe (or to uſe a Chymical Term of Art) Embrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Minerals, and perhaps Mettals, which may very much alter the Nature, and thereby vary the Kind of other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal Bodies, which they pervade, and in which they often come to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated; <hi>or elſe</hi> may, by convening among themſelves, conſtitute particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Concretions, as wee ſee that the fumes of Sulphur and thoſe of Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unite into that Lovely red Maſs, which in the Shops they call Vermilion, and which is ſo like to the Mineral, whence we uſually obtain Mercury, that the <hi>Latines</hi> give them both the ſame Name <hi>Cinnabaris,</hi> and in that are imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the French and Italians; in whoſe favour I ſhall adde, That if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this Mineral to conſiſt of a ſtony Concretion, penetrated by ſuch Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fumes as I have been ſpeaking of, the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:94784:118"/>
Appellation may be better excuſ'd then perhaps you imagine, ſince from <hi>Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baris nativa</hi> not onely I obtain'd a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of good running Mercury, (which is That, Men are wont to ſeek for from it,) but to gratifie my Curioſity ſomewhat further, I try'd an eaſie way, that came into my mind, whereby the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> afforded me no deſpicable Quantity of good combuſtible Sulphur. But this upon the By, being not oblig'd to ſet down here the grounds of my Paradoxical Conjecture about the Effects of ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal Fires and Heats, ſince I here lay no ſtreſs upon it, but return to what I was ſaying about <hi>Aetna,</hi> and other Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. Since then theſe Productions of the Fire, being of Nature's own make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cannot be deny'd to be Natural Bodies, I ſee not why the like Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Fire ſhould be thought unworthy that Name, onely becauſe the Fire, that made the former, was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94784:118"/>
by chance in a Hill, and that which produc'd the latter was kindled by a Man in a Furnace. And if flower of Sulphur, Lime, Glaſs, and colliquated mixtures of Metals and Minerals are to be reckon'd among Natural Bodies, it ſeems to be but reaſonable, that, upon the ſame grounds, we ſhould admit flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Antimony, Lime, and Glaſs, and Pewter, and Braſs, and many other Chymical Concretes, (if I may ſo call them) to be taken into the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and then 'twill be evident, that to diſtinguiſh the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, a Concourſe of Accidents will, without conſidering any Subſtantial Form, be ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe I need not, on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, have recourſe to inſtances of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputable nature, I will pitch, for the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Mechanical Production of Forms, upon Vitriol. For ſince Nature her ſelf, without the help of Art, does oftentimes produce that Concrete,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:94784:119"/>
(as I have elſewhere ſhewn by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,) there is no reaſon why Vitriol, produc'd by eaſie Chymical Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhould not be look'd upon as a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the ſame Nature and Kind. And in Factitious Vitriol, our knowing what Ingredients we make uſe of, and how we put them together, inables us to judge very well, how Vitriol is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd. But becauſe it is wont to be reckon'd with Salt-petre, Sea-ſalt, and Sal Gem among true Salts, I think it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to take notice in the firſt place, that Vitriol is not a meer Salt, but That, which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſomewhere, and after him divers other Spagyriſts, call a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery, which in their ſenſe (for there are that uſe it in another,) commonly ſignifies a Preparation, wherein the Body to be prepar'd has no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> its <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſeparated,</hi> as in Diſtillation, Incine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, &amp;c. but wherein the <hi>whole Body</hi> is brought into another form, by the <hi>addition</hi> of ſome Salt or Menſtruum,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:94784:119"/>
that is united <hi>per minima</hi> with it. And agreeably to this Notion we find, that from common Vitriol, whether native or factitious, may be obtain'd (by Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Reduction) an acid Saline Spirit, and a Metalline Subſtance, as I elſewhere mention, that from blew Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, Copper may be (by more then one way) ſeparated. And I the rather give this Advertiſement, becauſe that <hi>as</hi> there is a Vitriol of Iron, which is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually green; and another of Copper, which is wont to be blew; and alſo a white Vitriol, about which it is diſputed what it holds, (though that it holds ſome Copper I have found;) and yet all of theſe are without ſcruple reputed true Vitriols, notwithſtanding that they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo much in Colour, and (as I have diſcover'd) in ſeveral other Qualities; <hi>ſo</hi> I ſee no reaſon, why the other Minerals, being reduc'd by their proper Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums into Salt like Magiſteries, may not paſs for the Vitriols of thoſe Metals,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94784:120"/>
and conſequently for Natural Bodies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which, if granted, will adde ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation to our Doctrine, though its being granted is not neceſſary to make it out. For, to confine our ſelves to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, 'tis known among Chymiſts, that if upon the filings of <hi>Mars</hi> one put a convenient quantity of that acid diſtill'd Liquor, which is (abuſively) wont to be call'd Oyl of Vitriol, diluting the mixture with Rain, or with common Water, 'tis eaſie by Filtrating the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, by Evaporating the Aqueous ſuperfluity of it, and by leaving the reſt for a competent while in a Cellar, (or other cold place) to Chriſtallize, 'tis eaſie, I ſay, by this means to obtain a Vitriol of Iron; which agrees with the other Vitriol of Vitriol-ſtones or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſites, preſented us, by Nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of any other Menſtruum, then the Rain that falls upon them from the Clouds, in I know not how many Qualities, part Obvious, and part of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94784:120"/>
them Occult: As, (of the <hi>first ſort</hi>) in Colour, Tranſparency, Brittleneſſe, eaſineſs of Fuſion, Styptical Taſt, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibleneſs to a Red Powder by Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and other Qualities more obvious to be taken notice of; to which may be annex'd divers Qualities of the <hi>ſecond ſort,</hi> (I mean the more abſtruſe ones,) as the power to turn in a trice an Infuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Galls, made in ordinary water, (as alſo to turn a certain clear Mineral So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, elſewhere mention'd,) into an Inckly colour, to which, in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, we may adde a faculty of cauſing Vomits even in a ſmall Doſe, when ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the Stomach of a Man, and that remarkable property of being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with as exact and curious a ſhape or figure, as Thoſe, for which Salts have been, by modern Philoſophers eſpecially, ſo much admir'd. But, that no ſcruple might ariſe from hence, that in the <hi>Vitriolum Martis,</hi> wont to be made by Chymiſts, the Menſtruum,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:94784:121"/>
that is imploy'd, is the Oyl of common Vitriol, which may be ſuſpected to have retain'd the nature of the Concrete whence it proceeded, and ſo this Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Vitriol may not be barely a new Production, but partly a Recorporifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as they ſpeak, of the Vitriolate Corpuſcles contain'd in the Menſtruum: To prevent this Scruple I ſay, (which yet perhaps would not much trouble a Conſidering Chymiſt,) I thought fit to imploy a quite other Menſtruum, that would not be ſuſpected to have any thing of Vitriol in it. And though <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and Spirit of Nitre, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they <hi>corrode</hi> Mars, are unfit for ſuch a work, yet having pitch'd upon Spirit of Salt inſtead of Oyl of Vitriol, and proceeding the ſame way that has been already ſet down, it anſwer'd our Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, and afforded us a good green Vitriol. Nor will the great diſpoſition, I have obſerv'd in this our Vitriol, to reſolve, by the moiſture of the Air, into
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:94784:121"/>
a Liquor, make it eſſentially differing from other Vitriols, ſince it has been obſerv'd, and particularly by <hi>Guntherus Belichius</hi> more then once, that even the common Vitriol he uſ'd in <hi>Germany,</hi> will alſo, though not ſo eaſily as other Salts, run (as the Chymiſts phraſe it) <hi>per deliquium.</hi> And to make the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment more compleat, though we did not find either Oyl of Vitriol, or Spirit of Salt, good Menſtruums to make a blew Venereal Vitriol out of Copper, (however fil'd, or thinly lami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,) and though upon more Tryals then one, it appear'd, that <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> &amp; Spirit of Nitre, which we thought fit to ſubſtitute to the above mention'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, did indeed make a Solution of Copper, but ſo unctuous a one, that twas very hard to bring any part of it to dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, without ſpoyling the Colour and Shape of the deſir'd Body: yet repeating the Experiment with care and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we, this way, obtain'd one of the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:94784:122"/>
lovelieſt Vitriols that hath perhaps been ſeen, and of which you your ſelf may be the judg by a parcel of it I keep by me for a Rarity.</p>
                  <p>To apply now theſe Experiments, eſpecially That, wherein Spirit of Salt is imploy'd, to the purpoſe, for which I have mention'd them, let us briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe two things; the one, that our Factitious Vitriol is a Body, that, as well as the Natural, is endow'd with many Qualities, (manifeſt, and occult,) not onely ſuch as are common to it with other Salts, as Tranſparency, Brittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Solubleneſſe in Water, &amp;c. but ſuch as are Properties peculiar to it, as Greenneſs, eaſineſs of Fuſion, Styptici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Taſt, a peculiar Shape, a power to ſtrike a Black with infuſion of Galls, an Emetick faculty, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The other thing we are to conſider is, that though theſe Qualities are in common Vitriol believ'd to flow from the ſubſtantial Form of the Concrete,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:94784:122"/>
and may, as juſtly as the Qualities, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſt or occult, of other Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Bodies, be imploy'd as Arguments to evince ſuch a Form: yet in our Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, made with Spirit of Salt, the ſame Qualities and Properties were produc'd by the aſſociating and juxtapoſition of the two Ingredients, of which the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol was compounded, the Myſtery being no more but this, That the Steel being diſſolv'd in the Spirit, the Saline Particles of the former, and the Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ones of the latter, having each their Determinate Shapes, did by their Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation compoſe divers Corpuſcles of a mix'd or compounded Nature, from the Convention of many whereof, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted a new Body, of ſuch a Texture, as qualify'd it to affect our Senſories, and work upon other Bodies, after ſuch a manner as common Vitriol is wont to do. And indeed in our caſe, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it cannot be made appear, that there is any ſubſtantial Form generated anew,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94784:123"/>
but that there is not ſo much as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite mixture, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notion the Schools have of ſuch a Mixture. For Both the Ingredients retain their Nature, (though perhaps ſomewhat alter'd,) ſo that there is, as we were ſaying, but a Juxta-poſition of the Metalline and Saline Corpuſcles; onely they are aſſociated ſo, as by the mannner of their Coalition to acquire that new Texture, which Denominates the Magiſtery they compoſe, Vitriol. For 'tis evident, that the Saline Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient may either totally, or for much the greateſt part be ſeparated by Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the Metalline remaining behind. Nay ſome of the Qualities, we have been aſcribing to our Vitriol, do ſo much depend upon Texture, that the very Beams of the Sun (converg'd) will, as I have purpoſely try'd, very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily alter its Colour, as well as ſpoyl its Tranſparency, turning it at firſt from Green to White, and, if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center'd
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:94784:123"/>
by a good Burning glaſs, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it change that Livery for a deep Red.</p>

But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I look upon theſe Figures we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire in Salts, and in ſome kinds of Stones, (which I have not been Incuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to collect,) as Textures ſo ſimple and ſlight in compariſon of the Bodies of Animals, &amp; oftentimes in compariſon of ſome one Organical part, that I think it cannot be in the leaſt inferr'd, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch ſlight Figurations need not be aſcrib'd to the Plaſtick power of Seeds, it is not neceſſary, that the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious and incomparably more elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Fabrick and ſtructure of Animals themſelves ſhould be ſo. And this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſ'd, I ſhall adde, that I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to the Conjecture about the ſhapes of Salts, that I lately propoſ'd, by theſe Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That by a bare Aſſociation of Metalline and Saline Corpuſcles, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:94784:125"/>
as finely figur'd as other Vitriols, may be produc'd, as we have lately ſeen</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe that the Figures of theſe Salts are not conſtantly in all reſpects the ſame, but may in diverſe manners be ſomewhat varied, as they happen to be made to ſhoot more haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or more leiſurely, and as they ſhoot in a ſcanter, or in a fuller proportion of Liquor. This may be eaſily obſerv'd by any, that will but with a little Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſider the difference that may be found in Vitriolate Chriſtals or Grains, when quantities of them were taken out of the great Coolers, as they call them, wherein that Salt, at the Works where tis boyl'd, is wont to be ſet to ſhoot. And accordingly, where the Experienc'd Mineraliſt <hi>Agricola,</hi> deſcribes the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wayes of making Vitriol in great Quantities, he does not onely more then once call the great Grains or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals, into which it coagulates, Cubes; but ſpeaking of the manner of their
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94784:125"/>
Concretion about the Cords or Ropes, that are wont (in <hi>Germany</hi>) to be hang'd from certain croſs Bars into the Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Water or Solution for the Vitriol to faſten its ſelf to; he compares the Concretions indifferently to Cubes or Cluſters of Grapes: <hi>Ex his</hi> (ſayes he, ſpeaking of the croſs Bars,) <hi>pendent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes lapillis extentae, ad quos humor ſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus adhaereſcens denſatur in tranſlucentes atramenti ſutorii vel Cubos, vel Acinos, qui uvae ſpeciem gerunt.</hi> I remember al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that having many years ſince a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, that the Reaſon why <hi>Alkalys,</hi> ſuch as Salt of Tartar and Pot-aſhes are wont to be obtain'd in the form of white Powders or <hi>Calces,</hi> might be the way, wherein the Water, or the Lixivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums, that contain them, is wont to be drawn off, I fancied, that by leaving the Saline Corpuſcles a competent quanti- of Water to ſwimme in, and allowing them leaſure for ſuch a multitude of

Occurſions, as might ſuffice to make them hit upon more congruous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitions then is uſual, I might obtain Chriſtals of Them, as well as of other Salts: conjecturing this, I ſay, I cauſ'd ſome well purify'd <hi>Alkalys,</hi> diſſolv'd in clear water, to be ſlowly evaporated, till the Top was cover'd with a thin Ice-like Cruſt, then taking care not to break That, leaſt they ſhould (as in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way, where the Water is all forc'd off,) want a ſufficient ſtock of Liquor, I kept them in a very gentle heat for a good while; and then breaking the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned Ice like Cake, I had, as I wiſh'd, divers figured Lumps of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline Salt ſhot in the Water, and tranſparent almoſt like white Sugar Candy.</p>
                     <p>I likewiſe remember, that having, on ſeveral occaſions, diſtill'd a certain quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Oyl of Vitriol, with a ſtrong So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Sea-ſalt, till the remaining Matter was left dry, that Saline Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due

And yet theſe Chriſtals, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they would ſhoot into Priſme-like Figures, as Roch'd Petre; and ſometimes into ſhapes more like to Allome or Vitriol; nay though often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſame <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> diſſolv'd, would in the ſame Glaſs ſhoot into Chriſtals, whereof ſome would be of one ſhape, ſome of another, yet would theſe differing Grains or Chriſtals ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for the moſt part more exquiſitely figur'd, then oftentimes Vitriol does. From Spirit of Urine and Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, when I have ſuffer'd them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main long together before Coagulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and free'd the mixture from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous moiſture very ſlowly, I have ſometimes obtain'd fine long Chriſtals,

I found, that having (to afford the Metalline Corpuſcles ſcope to move in) diluted one part of the Solution with a great many parts of diſtill'd Rain water, (for common water will often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make ſuch Solutions become white or turbid,) a Plate of Copper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuſpended in the Liquor, and ſuffer'd to lie quiet there a while, (for it need not be long) there would ſettle, all about it, ſwarms of little Metalline and Undia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanbus Bodies, ſhining in the water like the ſcales of ſmall Fiſhes, but form'd into little Plates extremely thin, with ſurfaces not onely flat, but exceeding gloſſy: and among thoſe, divers of the larger were prettily figur'd at the Edges.

Though the <hi>Venetian</hi> Borax, wont to be ſold in ſhops, be known to be a facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Body, compounded of ſeveral Salts, that I ſhall not now ſtay to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate; and though, when we buy it, we uſually find it to conſiſt of Lumps and Grains miſhapen enough, yet when I diſſolv'd ſome of it in a good quantity of fair water, and made it coagulate ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry leiſurely, I had Chryſtals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon whoſe ſurfaces I could perceive very exquiſite and, as to ſenſe, regular Geometrical fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.

For, (to adde That upon the By,) that Salt, compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the two Spirits of Urine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of common Salt, is wont to be very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily figur'd, conſiſting of one long Beam as it were, whence on both ſides iſſue out far ſhorter Chriſtals, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perpendicular to that, and paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to one another like the Teeth in a Combe, and ſometimes ſo inclining, as to make the Whole appear almoſt like a Feather; which is the more remarkable, becauſe I have (many years ago) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that common <hi>Sal</hi> Armoniack, that is made of Urine and common Salt, both crude, with a Proportion of Soot, will, if warily diſſolv'd, and coagulated, ſhoot into Chriſtals of the like ſhape. How far the unknown Figure of a Salt may Poſſibly (for I fear it will not Eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) be gheſs'd at, by that of the Figure, which it makes with ſome other Salt, whoſe Figure is already known, I leave

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94784:134"/>
Bodies that Chymiſtry is able to afford us, are endow'd with more various and more noble Qualities, then many of thoſe, that are unqueſtionably Natural. And if we admit theſe Productions into the number of Natural Bodies, they will afford us a multitude of Inſtances, to ſhew, that Bodies may acquire many and Noble Qualities, barely by having Mechanical Affections, introduc'd by outward Agents into the Matter, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd there. As though Glaſs be ſuch a Noble Body, as we have lately taken notice of, yet ſince tis Fuſibility, Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency, and Brittleneſs, that are its onely Conſtituent Attributes, we can in leſs then an hour, (or, perhaps halfe that time,) turn an Opacous Body into Tranſparent Glaſs, without the Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any other Viſible Body, by a change of Texture, made in the ſame Matter, and by another change of Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, made without Addition, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we can, in a trice, reduce Glaſs into, or
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:94784:135"/>
obtain from it a Body, not Glaſſy, but Opacous, and otherwiſe of a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Nature, as it had been before. And here let me adde what may not a little conduce to our preſent Deſign, That even thoſe, that imbrace <hi>Aristotle's</hi> principles, do unawares confeſſe, that a ſlight change of Texture, without the introduction of a ſubſtantial Form, may not onely make a Specifical difference betwixt Bodies, but ſo vaſt a one, that they ſhall have differing <hi>Genus'es,</hi> and may (as the Chymiſts ſpeak) belong to differing Kingdoms. For Coral, to paſs by all other Plants of that kind, that may be mention'd to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, whilſt it grows in the Bottom of the Sea, is a real Plant, and ſeveral times (which ſuffices for my preſent ſcope) hath been there found by an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of mine, as well as by other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers, ſoft and tender like another Plant.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:94784:138"/>
proſecuted, it now remains, that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Second Argument, drawn, not (as the former) from the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, but from the Reproduction of a Phyſical Body. And though both theſe Arguments are valid; yet if this Latter could, in ſpight of the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties intervening in making of the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments that belong to it, be as clearly made out as the former, you would, I ſuppoſe, like it much the better of the two. For if we could Reproduce a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which has been depriv'd of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Form, you would, I preſume, think it highly probable, if not more then probable, that (to borrow our Author's Expreſſion) That which is commonly call'd the Form of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, which gives it its Being and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, and from whence all its Qualities are in the Vulgar Philoſophy, by I know not what inexplicable waies, ſuppoſ'd to flow; may be in ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies but a Characterization or Modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:94784:139"/>
of the Matter they conſiſt of; whoſe parts, by being ſo and ſo diſpoſ'd in relation to each other, conſtitute ſuch a determinate kind of Body, endow'd with ſuch and ſuch Properties; whereas, if the ſame parts were otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſd, they would conſtitute other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, of very differing Natures from that of the Concrete, whoſe parts they formerly were, and which may again reſult or be produc'd, after its diſſipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſeeming deſtruction, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union of the ſame component Particles, aſſociated according to their former Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>But though it were not Impoſſible to make an adaequate Redintegration of a Chymically Analiz'd Body, becauſe ſome of the diſſipated parts will either eſcape through the Junctures of the Veſſels, (though diligently cloſ'd,) or, if they be very ſubtle, will fly away up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſjoyning of the Veſſels; or, will irrecoverably ſtick to the inſide of

them: yet I ſee not, why ſuch a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, as is very poſſible to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, may not ſuffice to manifeſt what we intend to make out by it. For, even in ſuch Experiments, it appears, that when the Form of a Natural Body is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh'd, and its parts violently ſcatter'd; by the bare Reunion of ſome parts after the former manner, the very ſame Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the deſtroy'd Body was before made of, may, without Addition of other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, be brought again to conſtitute a Body of the <hi>like Nature</hi> with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, though not of <hi>equal Bulk.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Experiment, recorded by our Author, about the Reproduction of Salt Petre, as it is the beſt and ſucceſſesful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt I have ever been able to make upon Bodies, that require a ſtrong Heat to diſſipate them; ſo I hope it will ſuffice to give you thoſe thoughts about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the Author deſign'd in alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and therefore, though having premiſ'd thus much, I ſhall proceed to

acquaint you with the ſucceſs of ſome Attempts he intimates (in that Eſſay) his Intention of making, for the Redin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegration of ſome Bodies; yet doing it onely out of ſome Hiſtorical Notes I find among my looſe Papers, That, which I at preſent pretend to, is, but <hi>partly</hi> to ſhew you the <hi>difficulty</hi> of ſuch Attempts, which, ſince our Author's Eſſay was communicated, have been repreſented (I fear by Conjecture one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) as <hi>very eaſie</hi> to be accurately enough done; and <hi>partly,</hi> becauſe our Author does not, without reaſon, intimate the uſefulneſs of Redintegrations, in caſe they can be effected; and does, not cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, intimate, that ſuch Attempts, though they ſhould not Perfectly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, may increaſe the Number of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Active Bodies, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Inventory of Mankind's Goods.</p>
                  <p>Upon ſuch Conſiderations we attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Diſſipation and Reunion of the parts of common Amber; and though
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:94784:140"/>
Chymiſts, for fear of breaking their Veſſels, are wont, when they commit it to diſtillation, to adde to it a <hi>caput mortuum</hi> (as they ſpeak) of Sand, Brick, &amp;c. (in whoſe room we ſometimes chooſe to ſubſtitute beaten Glaſs;) which hinders them to judge of and employ the Remanence of the Amber, after the Diſtillation is finiſh'd: yet we ſuppoſ'd, and found, that if the Retort were not too much fill'd, and if the Fire were ſlowly and warily enough adminiſter'd, the Addition of any other Body would be needleſs. Wherefore having put into a Glaſs Retort four or five Ounces of Amber, and adminiſtred a gentle and gradual heat, we obſerv'd the Amber to melt and bubble, (which we therefore mention, becauſe ingenious men have lately queſtioned, whether it can be mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,) and having ended the Operation, &amp; ſever'd the veſſels, we found, that there was come over in the form, partly of Oyl, partly of Spirit &amp; Flegm, and partly of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:94784:141"/>
volatile Salt, near half the weight of the Concrete: and having broken the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, we found, in the bottom of it, a Cake of coal-black Matter, then whoſe upper ſurface I ſcarce remember to have ſeen in my whole life any thing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely poliſh'd; in ſo much, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Colour, as long as I kept it, it was fit to ſerve for a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glaſs: and this ſmooth Maſs being broken, (for it was exceeding brittle,) the larger fragments of it appear'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with an excellent luſtre. All thoſe parts of the Amber, being put together into a Glaſs Body, with a blind head lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it, were placed in Sand, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated by a gentle heat: but whilſt I ſtept aſide to receive a Viſit, the Fire having been increaſ'd without my knowledge, the Fumes aſcended ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly, that they lifted up the Veſſel out of the Sand, whereupon falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſide of the Furnace, it broke at the top, but, being ſeaſonably call'd,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:94784:141"/>
we ſav'd all but the Fumes; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Matter looks not unlike Tarre, and with the leaſt heat may be powr'd out like a Liquor, ſticking even when it is cold to the fingers. Yet this open'd Body doth not eaſily communicate ſo much as a Tincture to ſpirit of Wine, (which therefore ſeems ſomewhat ſtrange, becauſe another time preſume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that this would be a good way to obtain a Solution of ſome of the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous parts of Amber, we did, by pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſpirit of Wine, that (though recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd) was not of the very beſt, upon the reunited parts of Amber, lightly dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted into a Maſs, eaſily obtain a clear Yellow Solution, very differing from the Tincture of Amber, and abounding (as I found by Tryal) in the diſſolv'd ſubſtance of the Amber:) but in Oyl of Turpentine we have, in a ſhort time, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd it into a bloud red Balſome, which may be of good uſe (at leaſt) to Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions. And having agen made the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:94784:142"/>
former Experiment with more warineſs then before, we had the like ſucceſs in our Diſtillation, but, the reunited parts of the Amber being ſet to digeſt in a large Bolt head, the Liquor that was drawn off, did, in a few hours, from its own <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> extract a bloud red Tincture, or elſe made a Solution of ſome part of it, whereby it obtain'd a very deep Red; but having been, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening Accidents, hindred from fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the Experiment, we miſt the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of knowing to what it may be brought at laſt.</p>
                  <p>And as for what our Author tels us of this deſign to attempt the Redinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of Vitriol, Turpentine, and ſome other Concretes, wherein it ſeem'd not unpracticable, he found in it more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty then every one would expect. For the Bodies, on which ſuch Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are likelieſt to ſucceed, ſeem to be Allom, Sea ſalt, and Vitriol. And as for Allom, he found it a troubleſome
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:94784:142"/>
work to take (as a Spagiriſt would ſpeak) the Principles of it aſunder, in regard, that it is inconvenient to diſtill it with a <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> (as Chymiſts call any fix'd Additament,) leaſt that ſhould hinder the deſir'd Redintegration of the diſſipated parts: And when he diſtill'd it by its ſelf, without any ſuch Addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he found, that, with a moderate heat, the Allom would ſcarce part with any thing but its Phlegm, and if he urg'd it with a ſtrong fire, he found, it would ſo ſwell, as to endanger the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Retort, or threaten the boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over into the Receiver. (Yet having once been able very warily to abſtract as much Flegm and Spirit, as I conveniently could, from a parcel of Roch Allom, and having powr'd it back upon that pulveriz'd <hi>caput mortuum,</hi> and left the veſſel long in a quiet place, I found, that the Corpuſcles of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, having had time, after a multitude of Occurſions, to accommodate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:94784:143"/>
themſelves to the more fix'd parts of the Concrete, did by that Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (or Diſſolution) recompoſe, at the top of the Powder, many Chriſtalline Grains of finely figur'd Salt, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing with time, made me hope, that, at the length, the whole or the greateſt part would be reduc'd into Allom, which yet a Miſchance, that robb'd me of the Glaſs, hindred me to ſee.) So likewiſe of Sea ſalt, if it be diſtill'd, as it is uſual, with thrice its weight of burn'd Clay, or beaten Brick, twill prove inconvenient in reference to its Redintegration; and if it be diſtill'd alone, it is apt to be fluxt by the heat of the fire, and, whilſt it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in Fuſion, will ſcarce yield any Spirit at all. And as for Vitriol, though the Redintegration of it might ſeem to be leſs hopeful, then that of the other Salts, in regard that it conſiſts not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a Saline, but of a Metalline Body, whence it may be ſuppoſ'd to be of a more intricate and elaborate Texture
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:94784:143"/>
yet becauſe there needs no <hi>caput mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> in the Diſtillation of it, we did, to purſue our Author's intimated deſigns, make two or three Attempts upon it, and ſeem'd to miſs of our Aime, rather upon the Account of accidental hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, then of any inſuperable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the thing it ſelf. For once, we with a ſtrong fire, drew off from a parcel of common blew Vitriol, the Phlegm and Spirit, and ſome quantity of the heavy Oyl, (as Chymiſts abuſively call it:) Theſe Liquors, as they came over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Separation, we divided into ſeveral parts, and the remaining very red <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> into as many. One of theſe parcels of Liquor we poured over night upon its correſpondent portion of the newly mentioned red Powder. But having left it in a Window, and the Night proving very bitter, in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I found the Glaſs crack'd in many places by the violence of the Froſt, and the Liquor ſeem'd to have been ſoak'd
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:94784:144"/>
up by the Powder, and to have very much ſwelled it. This mixture then I took out, and placing it in an open mouth'd Glaſs in a Window, I found, after a while, divers Grains of pure Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol upon the other Matter, and ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Swellings, not unlike thoſe we ſhall preſently have Occaſion to ſpeak of. I took likewiſe a much larger parcel of the forementioned Liquor, and its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent proportion of <hi>Caput mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>; and having leiſurely mixt them in a large Glaſs Baſon, I obtain'd divers <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena,</hi> that belong not to this place, but may be met with, where they will more properly fall in. In this Baſon (which I lay'd in the Window, and kept from Agitation,) I perceived, after a while, the Liquor to acquire a blewiſh Tincture, and after ten or twelve weeks, I found the mixture dry, (for, it ſeems, it was too much expoſed to the Air:) but the Surface of it adorn'd in divers places with Grains of Vitriol very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:94784:144"/>
figur'd. And beſides theſe, there were ſtore of Protuberances, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of aboundance of ſmall vitriolate particles, which ſeem'd in the way to a Coalition; for having let the Baſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for four or five months longer, the Matter appear'd cruſted over, partly with very elevated Saline protuberan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, partly with leſſer parcels, and partly alſo with conſiderably broad Cakes of Vitriol, ſome of above half an Inch in breadth, and proportionably long; and indeed the whole ſurface was ſo odly diverſifi'd, that I cannot count the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, theſe Tryals have put me to, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Another time in a more ſlender and narrow mouth'd Glaſs I pour'd back upon the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> of Vitriol the Liquors, I had by violence of the fire forc'd from it; ſo that the Liquid part did ſwim a pretty height above the red <hi>Calx,</hi> and remain'd a while limpid and colourleſs: but the veſſel having ſtood, for ſome time, unſtop'd in a Window,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:94784:145"/>
the Liquor after a while, acquir'd by degrees a very deep vitriolate colour, and not long after, there appear'd, at the bottom and on the top of the <hi>Calx,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fair and exquiſitely figur'd Grains of Vitriol, which cover'd the ſurface of the <hi>Calx</hi>; and the longer the veſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>el con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd in the Window, the deeper did this Change, made upon the upper part of the Powder, ſeem to penetrate: ſo that I began to hope, that, in proceſs of time, almoſt (if not more then almoſt) the whole mixture would be reduc'd to perfect Vitriol. But an Accident robb'd me of my Glaſs, before I could ſee the utmoſt of the Event.</p>
                  <p>And, on this Occaſion, I muſt not praetermit an odd Experiment I lately made, though I dare not undertake to make it agen. I elſewhere relate, how I digeſted, for divers weeks, a Quantity of powder'd Antimony, with a greater weight by half of Oyl of Vitriol, and how having at length committed this
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94784:145"/>
mixture to Diſtillation, and thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, beſides a little Liquor, a pretty quantity of combuſtible Antimonial or Antimonio Virriolate Sulphur; there remained, in the bottom of the Retort, a ſomewhat light and very friable <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> all the upper part of which was at leaſt as white as common Wood-aſhes, and the reſt look'd like a Cinder. And now I muſt tell you what became of this <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> whereof I there make no further mention. We could not well foreſee what could be made of it, but very probable it was, that it would afford us ſome new Diſcovery, by being expoſed to the fire, in regard of the copious Sulphur, whereof it ſeem'd to have been deprived: provided it were urg'd in cloſe Veſſels, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be loſt. Whereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to a naked fire in a ſmall glaſs Retort, well Coated, and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a Receiver, we kept it there many hours, and at length ſevering the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94784:146"/>
Veſſels, we found (which need not be wonder'd at) no Antimonial Quick-ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and much leſs of Sulphur ſublim'd then we expected: wherefore greedily haſtning to the <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> we found it flux'd into a Maſs, covered with a thin Cake of Glaſs, whoſe fragments being held againſt the light, were not at all coloured, as Antimonial Glaſs is wont to be, but were as colourleſſe as common white Glaſs. The Lump above mentioned being broken, was found, ſomewhat to our wonder, to be perfect black Antimony, adorn'd with long ſhining ſtreaks, as common Antimony is wont to be: onely this Antimony ſeem'd to have been a little refin'd by the ſequeſtration of its unneceſſary Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur; which Ingredient ſeems by this Experiment, as well as by ſome other Obſervations of ours, to be more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ſome particular Parcels of that Mineral, then is abſolutely requiſite to the conſtitution of Antimony. Though
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:94784:146"/>
in our caſe it <hi>may</hi> be ſuſpected, that the reduction of part of the Maſs to a colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Glaſs, was an effect of the Abſence of ſo much of the Sulphur, and might <hi>in part</hi> make the remaining Maſſe ſome amends for it. What we further did with this new or reproduced Concrete, is not proper to be here told you: onely, for your ſatisfaction, we have kept a Lump of it, that you may, with us, take notice of what ſome Philoſophers would call the Mindfulneſs of Nature, which, when a Body was deprived of a not inconſiderable portion of its chiefe Ingredient, and had all its other parts diſſipated, and ſhuffled, and diſcolour'd, ſo as not to be knowable, was able to rally thoſe ſcatter'd and diſguiſed parts, and Marſhal or diſpoſe them into a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the former Conſiſtence, Colour, &amp;c. though (which is not here to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook'd) the Contexture of Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, by reaſon of the copious ſhining <hi>Styriae,</hi> that enoble the darker Body, be
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:94784:147"/>
much more elaborate, and therefore more uneaſie to be reſtored, then that of many other Concretes.</p>
                  <p>But among all my Tryals about the Redintegration of Bodies, That which ſeem'd to ſucceed beſt, was made upon Turpentine: for having taken ſome Ounces of this, very pure, and good, and put it into a Glaſs Retort, I diſtill'd ſo long with a very gentle fire, till I had ſeparated it into a good quantity of very clear Liquor, and a <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> very dry and brittle: then breaking the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, I powder'd the <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> which, when it was taken out, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſleek, and tranſparent enough, and very Red; but being powder'd, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd of a pure Yellow colour. This Powder I carefully mixt vvith the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, that had been diſtill'd from it, vvhich immediately diſſolv'd part of it into a deep red Balſam; but by further Digeſtion in a large Glaſs exquiſitely ſtopt, that Colour began to grovv fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:94784:147"/>
though the remaining part of the Povvder, (except a very little propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to ſo much of the Liquor, as may be ſuppoſ'd to have been vvaſted by Evaporation, and Transfuſion out of one Veſſel into another,) be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſolv'd, and ſo well reunited to the more fugitive parts of the Concrete, that there is ſcarce any, that by the ſmell, or taſt, or conſiſtence vvould take it for other then good and laudable Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine.</p>

                  <p>TAke good and clear Oyl of Vitriol, and caſt into it a convenient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of good Camphire groſly beaten; let it float there a while, and, without the help of external hear, it will inſenſlibly be reſolv'd into a Liquor, which, from time to time, as it comes to be produc'd, you may, by ſhaking the Glaſs, mingle with the Oyl of Vitriol, whereunto you may, by this means, impart firſt a fine Yellow, and then a colour, which though it be not a true Red, will be of kin to it, and ſo very deep, as to make the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture almoſt quite Opacous. When all
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:94784:151"/>
the Camphire is perfectly diſſolv'd by incorporating with the Menſtruum, if you hit upon good Ingredients, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a right Proportion, (for a ſlight Miſtake in either of them, may make this part of the Experiment miſcarry,) you may probably obtain ſuch a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as I have more then once had, namely, ſuch a one, as not onely to me, whoſe ſenſe of Smelling is none of the Dulleſt, but alſo to others, that knew not of the Experiment, ſeem'd not at all to have an Odour of the Camphire. But if into this Liquor you pour a due quantity of fair Water, you will ſee (perhaps not without delight) that, in a trice, the Liquor will become pale, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as at the firſt, and the Camphire, that lay conceal'd in the pores of the Menſtruum, will immediately diſcloſe it ſelf, and emerge, in its own nature and priſtine form of white floating and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible Camphire, which will fill not the Viol onely, but the neighbouring
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:94784:151"/>
part of the Air with its ſtrong and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive Odour.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may, beſides the uſes we elſewhere make of it, afford us ſeveral particulars pertinent to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. For (firſt) we ſee a lighter and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent Body brought, by a Comminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into Particles of a certain figure, to be kept ſwimming, and mixed with a Liquor, on which it floated before, and which is, by great odds, heavier then it ſelf: ſo that as by the Solution of Gold in <hi>Aqua regis,</hi> it appears, that the pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouſeſt of Bodies, if it be reduc'd to parts minute enough, may be kept from ſinking in a Liquor much lighter then it ſelf: So this Experiment of Ours mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts what I know not whether hitherto Men have prov'd, That the Corpuſcles of Lighter Bodies may be kept from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merging to the Top of a much heavier Liquor: which Inſtance being added to that of the Gold, may teach us, that,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:94784:152"/>
when Bodies are reduc'd to very minute parts, we muſt as well conſider their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Texture, as the receiv'd Rules of the Hydroſtaticks, in determining whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will ſink, or float<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſwim.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. This Experiment alſo ſhews, that ſeveral Colours, and even a very deep one, may ſoon be produc'd by a White Body, and a clear Liquor, and that without the intervention of fire, or any external heat.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. And that yet this Colour may, almoſt in the twinckling of an Eye, be deſtroy'd, and as it were annihilated, and the Latitant Whiteneſs, as many would call it, may be as ſuddainly reſtor'd by the Addition of nothing but fair Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vvhich has no Colour of its ovvn, upon vvhoſe account it might be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſ'd to be contrary to the periſhing colour, or to heighten the other into a Praedominancy: nor does the Water take into its ſelf, either the Colour it deſtroy'd, or That it reſtores. For</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:94784:152"/>IV. The more then ſemi-opacity of the Solution of Camphire and Oyl of Vitriol does preſently vaniſh; and that Menſtruum, with the Water, make up (as ſoon as the Camphorate Corpuſcles come to be a float) one tranſparent and colourleſs Liquor.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. And tis worth noting, that upon the mixture of a Liquor, which makes the Fluid much Lighter, (for ſo Water is in reſpect of Vitriol,) a Body is made to emerge, that did not ſo, when the Fluid was much heavier. This Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may ſerve to countenance what we elſewhere argue againſt the Schools, touching the Controverſie about Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. For whereas though ſome of them diſſent, yet moſt of them maintain, that the Elements alwaies looſe their Forms in the mix'd Bodies they conſtitute; and though if they had dexterouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd their Opinion, and limited their Aſſertions to ſome caſes, perhaps the Doctrine might be tolerated: yet ſince
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:94784:153"/>
they are wont to propoſe it crudely and univerſally, I cannot but take notice, how little tis favour'd by this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; wherein even a mix'd Body (for ſuch is Camphire) doth, in a further mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, retain its Form and Nature, and may be immediately ſo divorced from the Body, to which it was united, as to turn, in a trice, to the manifeſt Exerciſe of its former Qualities. And this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment being the eaſieſt Inſtance, I have deviſ'd, of the preſervation of a Body, when it ſeems to be deſtroy'd, and of the Recovery of a Body to its former Conditions; I deſire it may be take<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> notice of, as an inſtance I ſhall after have Occaſion to have recourſe to, and make uſe of.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. But the notableſt thing in the Experiment is, that Odours ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend ſo much upon Texture; that one of the ſubtleſt and ſtrongeſt ſented Drugs, that the Eaſt it ſelf or indeed the World affords us, ſhould ſo ſoon
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:94784:153"/>
quite looſe its Odour, by being mix'd with a Body that has ſcarce, if at all, any ſenſible Odour of its own, and This, while the Camphorate Corpuſcles ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive undeſtroy'd, in a Liquor, from whence one would think, that leſſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and fugitive Bodies, then they, ſhould eaſily exhale.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Nor is it much leſſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that ſo ſtrong and piercing a Sent as that of Camphire, ſhould be, in a moment, produc'd in a Mixture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in none of it could be perceiv'd before, by ſuch a Liquor as Water, that is quite devoid of any Odour of its own: which ſo eaſie and ſuddain reſtauration of the Camphire to its Native Sent, as well as other Qualities, by ſo languid a Liquor as common Water, doth likewiſe argue, that the Union or Texture of the two Ingredients, the Camphire and the Oyl of Vitriol, was but very ſlight, upon which nevertheleſſe a great alteration in point of Qualities depended. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:94784:154"/>
that divers of the praeceding <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> depend upon the particular Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Liquors, imploy'd to exhibit them, I ſhall add, that if, inſtead of oyl of Vitriol, you caſt the Concrete into well deflegm'd Spirit of Nitre, you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no red, nor dark, but a Tranſparent and Colourleſs Solution. And when to the above mention'd red Mixture I put, inſtead of fair Water, about 2 or 3 parts of duely rectifi'd Spirit of Wine, there would enſue no ſuch changes, as thoſe formerly recited; but the Spirit of Wine, that diſſolv'd the Concrete, when it was by it ſelf, without looſing its Diaphaneity, or acquiring any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, did, when it diſſolv'd the Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, diſſolve it with its new adventiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Colour, looking like a groſs red Wine, ſomewhat turbid, or not yet well freed from its Lees: ſo that this Colour appear'd to reſide in the Mixture as ſuch, ſince neither of the two Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents diſſolv'd in, or mingled vvith the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:94784:154"/>
Spirit of Wine, would have afforded that Colour, or indeed any other. But if to this Liquor, that look'd like troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Wine, we poured a large Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fair Water, the Redneſs would immediately vaniſh, and the Whole would, <hi>as to ſenſe,</hi> become White throughout; I ſay, <hi>as to ſenſe,</hi> becauſe the Whiteneſſe did not indeed apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain properly to the whole Mixture, but to a huge multitude of little Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles of the reviv'd Concrete, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome or other, which at firſt ſwamme confuſedly to and fro, left no ſenſible Portion of the Liquor unfurniſh'd with ſome of them; whereas when the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorate Corpuſcles had leiſure to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge, as they ſoon did, they floated in the forme of a White Powder or Froth at the top of the Liquor, leaving all the reſt as clear and colourleſſe as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water.</p>
                  <p>But we have not yet mention'd all the uſe, we deſign'd to make of our
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:94784:155"/>
Mixture, for by proſecuting the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment a little further, we made it afford us ſome new <hi>Phaenomena.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. For having kept the Mixture in a moderately warme place, (which circumſtance had perhaps no influence on the Succeſſe,) and having diſtill'd it out of a Glaſs Retort, the Event an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd our Expectation, and the Liquor, that came over, had a Sent; which, though very ſtrong, was quite differing both from that of the Mixture, and that of the Camphire; and in the remaining Body, though the Liquor and the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire it conſiſted of, were either both tranſparent, or the one tranſparent as a Liquor, and the other white, as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and colourleſſe Bodies are wont to be made by Contuſion: yet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Maſs, which amounted to a good part of the Mixture, was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Opacous, but as black as Coal, is ſome places looking juſt like poliſhed
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:94784:155"/>
Jet; which is the more conſiderable, becauſe that though Vegetable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that are not fluid, are wont to acquire a Blackneſs from the fire, yet neither do Liquors, that have already been diſtill'd, obtain that Colour upon Rediſtillation, neither have we, upon Tryal purpoſely made, found, that Camphire, expoſ'd to fire in a Retort, fitted with a Receiver, (which was the caſe of the preſent Experiment,) would at all acquire a Jetty Colour, but would either totally aſcend White, or afford <hi>Flores,</hi> and a <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> (as a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Chymiſt would call the Remaines) of the ſame Colour, both in reſpect of one another, and in reſpect of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. And our Experiment afforded this notable <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> That though Oyl of Vitriol be a diſtill'd Liquor, and though Camphire be ſo very fugitive a Subſtance, that being left in the Air, it will, of it ſelf, fly all away; and therefore
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:94784:156"/>
Phyſicians and Druggiſts preſcribe the keeping it in Linſeeds or <hi>Millium,</hi> or other convenient Bodies, to hinder its Avolation; yet, by our Experiment, its Fugacity is ſo reſtrain'd, that not onely the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> newly mention'd, endured a good fire in the Retort, before it was reduc'd to that pitchy Subſtance vve vvere lately mentioning, but having taken ſome of that ſubſtance out of the Retort, &amp; order'd it, by a careful Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to be kept in a cloſely cover'd Crucible during ſome time in the fire; when it vvas brought me back, after the Pot had been kept red hot above half an hour, there remain'd a good quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Matter, brittle, vvithout any ſmell of Camphire, and as black as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Charcoal; ſo much do the Fixity and Volatility of Bodies depend upon Texture.</p>

                  <p>AMong thoſe other Experiments of mine, <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> which tend to manifeſt, that new Qualities may be produc'd in Bodies, as the Effects of new Textures; I remember, ſome years ago, I writ for a Friend a whole Set of Tryals, that I had made about the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges I could produce in Metals and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, by the Intervention of Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. But though the whole Tract, wherein they are recited, might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent enough to our preſent Subject; yet reſerving other paſſages of it for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, (eſpecially for our Notes upon thoſe particular Qualities, which they are moſt proper to illuſtrate,) it may at this time ſuffice me to ſend you a Tranſcript of what that Account con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, relating to Copper and Silver, the one a mean and fugitive, and the other a noble and fix'd Metal. For thoſe changes
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:94784:157"/>
Colour, Conſiſtence, Fuſibleneſſe, and other Qualities, which you will meet with in theſe Experiments, will afford us divers <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> to ſhew what great Changes may be made, even in Bodies ſcarce corruptible, by one or more of thoſe three Catholick wayes of Natures working according to the Corpuſcular Principles, namely, the Acceſs, the Receſs, and the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the minute Particles of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>As for my Method of changing the Texture of Copper, I confeſs it hath oftentimes ſeem'd ſtrange to me, that Chymiſts, plainly ſeeing the notable Effect, that Sublimate, diſtill'd from Antimony, has upon that Mineral, by opening it, and volatilizing it, (as we ſee it do in the making of what they are pleaſ'd to call <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi>) ſhould not have the Curioſity to try, whether or no Sublimate might not likewiſe produce, if nor the ſame, yet a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:94784:157"/>
Change in other Mineral Bodies, there appearing no reaſon, or at leaſt there having been none given, that I know of, why the Reſerating Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (if I may ſo ſpeak) of Sublimate, ſhould be confin'd to Antimony. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Conſiderations, we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to endeavour to ſupply the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect we had obſerv'd in Chymiſts, of improving the Experiment of <hi>Butyrum Antimonii</hi>: and though an Indiſpoſition in point of Health, which befell us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had made any great progreſs in our Enquiries, made us ſo ſhy of the Fumes of Sublimate and Minerals, that we neither did make all our Tryals ſo accurately, nor proſecute them ſo far as we would have done, had we been to deal with more innocent Materials: Yet we ſuppoſe, it will not be unwelcome to You, to receive from us a naked, but faithful, Narrative of our Proceedings; being apt to think, that you will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in find Inducements to carry on this
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:94784:158"/>
Experiment further then we have done, and to compleat what we have but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, we took half a pound of Copper plates, of about an Inch broad, and the thickneſs of a Grain of Wheat, (which we after found was too great,) and of an arbitrary length; then caſting a Pound of groſly beaten <hi>Venetian</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate into the bottom of a ſomewhat deep Glaſs Retort, we caſt in the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per plates upon it, that the Fumes of the Sublimate might, in their Aſcenſion, be compell'd to act upon the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent Metal, and then placing this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, as deep as we well could, in a Sand Furnace, and adapting to it a ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, we adminiſter'd a Gradual fire ſeaven or eight hours, and at length for a while increaſ'd the heat, as much as we well could do in ſuch a Furnace. The ſucceſs of this Operation was as follows.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There came little or no Liquor at all over into the Receiver, but the Neck &amp;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:94784:158"/>
upper part of the Retort were Candied on the inſide, by reaſon of the copious Sublimate adhaering to them, which Sublimate weigh'd above Ten Ounces; in the Retort we found about two Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and a quarter of running Mercury, which had been ſuffer'd to revive by the acid Salts, which corroding the Copper, forſook the Quickſilver, whereto they had been in the Sublimate united.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Upon the increaſe of the fire, there was plainly heard a Noiſe, made by the melting Matter in the Retort, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that of a boyling Pot, or of Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol, when being committed to a Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fire, it is firſt brought to flow. And this Noiſe we found to be a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Circumſtance of this Experiment, then the revification of part of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury contain'd in the Sublimate; for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another Tryal, made with the former proportion of Copper plates and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate, we obſerv'd, during a very long while, ſuch a Noiſe as hath been already
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:94784:159"/>
mention'd, but the Operation being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, we ſcarce found ſo much as a few Grains of running Mercury, either in the Retort or Receiver.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We found the Metalline Lump, in the bottom of the Retort, to have been increaſ'd in weight ſomewhat more then (though not half an Ounce above) two Ounces; ſome of the Copper plates, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the bottom of the Maſs, retain'd yet their Figure and Malleableneſſe, which we aſcrib'd to their not having been thin enough to be ſufficiently wrought upon by the Sublimate: the Others, which were much the greater number, had wholly loſt their Metalline form, and were melted into a very brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Lump, which I can compare to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more fitly, then a lump of good Benjamin; for this Maſs, though pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous, was no leſs brittle, and being broken, appear'd of divers Colours, which ſeem'd to be almoſt tranſparent, in ſome places it was red, in others of a
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:94784:159"/>
high and pleaſant Amber Colour, and in other parts of it, Colours more dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh and mix'd might be diſcern'd.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But this ſtrange Maſs being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into ſmaller Lumps, and laid upon a Sheet of White Paper in a Window, was, by the next morning, where ever the Air came at it, all cover'd with a lovely greeniſh Blew, or rather, blewiſh Green, almoſt like that of the beſt Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degreeſe, and the longer it lay in the air, the more of the internal parts of the Fragments did paſs into the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: but the vvhite Paper, which in ſome places they ſtain'd, ſeem Dy'd of a Green colour inclining unto Yellow. And here we had Occaſion to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the inſinuating ſubtlety of the Air; for having put ſome pieces of this Cupreous Gum (if I may ſo call it) into a little Box, to ſhut out the Air, which vve have found it poſſible to exclude by other means, vve found, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our care, thoſe included
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:94784:160"/>
Fragments were, as well as the reſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mention'd, covered with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as it were of <hi>viride Aeris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. We muſt not, on this Occaſion, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to tell you, that, having, the laſt year, made ſome Tryals in reference to this Experiment, we obſerv'd in one of them, that ſome little Copper plates, from which Sublimate had been drawn off, retain'd their priſtine ſhape, and Metalline nature, but were Whitened over like Silver, and continu'd ſo for divers Months, (though we cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely tell you hovv long, having at length accidentally loſt them.) And to try vvhether this Whiteneſs vvere one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuperficial, vve purpoſely broke ſome of theſe flexible Plates, and found, that this Silver colour had penetrated them throughout, and vvas more glorious in the very Body of the Metal, then on its Surface, vvhich made us ſuſpect, that the Sublimate, by us imploy'd, had been adulterated vvith Arſenick, (vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:94784:160"/>
the Sophiſticators of Metals are wont to make Blanchers for Copper, but not to mention, that rhe Malleable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe continu'd, which Arſenick is wont to deſtroy,) we diſcover'd not by Tryal, that the Sublimate was other then ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In this Metalline Gum the Body of the Copper appear'd ſo chang'd and open'd, that we were invited to look upon ſuch a Change as no ignoble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, conſidering the Difficulty, which the beſt Artiſts tell us there is, and which thoſe, that have attempted it, have found, I ſay not, to unlock the Sulphur of Venus, but to effect leſſe Changes in its Texture, then was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made. For this Gum, caſt upon a quick Coal, and a little blown, will partly melt and flow like Roſin, and partly flame, and burn like a Sulphur, and with a flame ſo laſting, if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled as often as it leaves off burning, that we obſerv'd it, not without ſome
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:94784:161"/>
Wonder; and ſo inflammable is this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Copper, that, being held to the flame of a Candle, or a piece of lighted Paper, it would almoſt in a moment take fire, and ſend forth a flame like common Sulphur, but onely that it ſeem'd to us to incline much more to a greeniſh colour, then the blewer flame of Brimſtone is wont to do.</p>
                  <p>To theſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of our Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it was made with Copper, my Notes inable me to ſubjoyn ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, exhibited when we made it with Sublimate and Silver.</p>
                  <p>There were taken of the pureſt ſort of Coined Silver we could get, half a ſcort thin Plates, on which vvas caſt double the vveight of Sublimate in a ſmall and ſtrongly coated Retort.

                  <p>Next whereas Silver is one of the moſt Opacous Bodies in Nature, and Sublimate a White one, the produc'd Maſs was in great part Tranſparent, though not like Glaſs, yet like good Amber.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Texture of the Silver
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:94784:163"/>
was exceedingly alter'd: for our Maſs, inſtead of being Malleable and Flexible, as that Metal is very much, appear'd, if you went about to cut it with a Knife, like Horn, yet otherwiſe eaſily apt to crack and break, though not at all to bend.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, whereas Silver will indure Ignition for a good while before it be brought to Fuſion, our Mixture will eaſily melt, not onely upon quick coals, but in the flame of a Candle; but this Reſin, or Gum (if I may ſo call it) of our fix'd Metal did not, like that, we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly deſcrib'd, of Copper, tinge the flame of a Candle, or produce with the glowing coals, on which tis laid, either a green or blewiſh colour.</p>
                  <p>And (<hi>Pyrophilus</hi>) to diſcover how much theſe Operations of the Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate upon Copper and Silver depend upon the particular Textures of theſe Bodies, I took two parcels of Gold, the one common Gold thinly laminated,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:94784:164"/>
and the other very well refin'd, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving caſt each of theſe in a diſtinct Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, upon no leſs then thrice its weight of groſly beaten Sublimate, I cauſ'd this laſt nam'd ſubſtance to be, in a Sand fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, elevated from the Gold, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                  <p>Before I diſmiſs this ſubject, <hi>Pyrophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> I muſt not conceale from you, that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:94784:164"/>
in the Papers, whence theſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made with Sublimate have been tranſcribed, I annex'd to the whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe a few Advertiſements, whereof the firſt was, That I was reduc'd, in thoſe Experiments, to imploy, for want of a better, a Sand Furnace, wherein I could not give ſo ſtrong a fire as I deſir'd, which circumſtance may have had ſome Influence upon the recited <hi>Phaenomena</hi>; and among other Advertiſements there being one, that will not be impertinent to my preſent Deſign, and may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly afford a not unſuccesful Hint, I ſhall ſubjoin it in the words, wherein I find it deliver'd.</p>
                  <p>The next thing, of which I am to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe you, is this, That this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may probably be further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, by imploying about it various and new kinds of Sublimate, and that ſeveral other things may be ſublim'd up together either with crude Mercury, or with common Sublimate, he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:94784:165"/>
the way of making vulgar Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, will not, I ſuppoſe, deny. To give you onely one Inſtance, I ſhall inform you, that, having cauſ'd about equal parts of common Sublimate and Sal Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack to be well powder'd and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by ſubliming the Mixture in ſtrong and large Urinals plac'd in a Sand Furnace, we obtain'd a new kind of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate, differing from the former, which we manifeſted <hi>ad Oculum,</hi> by diſſolving a little of it and a little of common Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate ſeverally in fair water; for drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a little reſolv'd ſalt of Tartar upon the ſolution of common Sublimate, it immediately turn'd of an Orange tawny colour, but dropping the ſame Liquor upon the ſolution of the Ammoniack Sublimate, if I may ſo call it, it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn'd into a Liquor in Whiteneſſe reſembling Milk: And having from 4 ounces of Copper plates drawn 6 ounces of this new Sublimate after the already often recited manner, we had indeed in
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:94784:165"/>
the bottom of the Retort a Cupreous Reſin, not much unlike That, made by Copper and common Sublimate; and this Reſin did, like the other, in the moiſt Air, ſoon begin to degenerate into a kind of Verdigreeſe. But that which was ſingular in this Operation was, that not onely ſome of the Sublimate had carried up, to a good height, enough of the Copper to be manifeſtly colour'd by it of a fine blewiſh Green, but into the Receiver there was paſs'd neer an Ounce of Liquor, that ſmelt almoſt like ſpirit of Sal Armoniack, and was tincted like the Sublimate, ſo that we ſuppoſ'd the Body of the Venus to have been better wrought upon by this, then by the former Sublimate. And yet I judg'd not this way to be the moſt effectual way of improving common Sublimate, being apt to think, upon grounds not now to be mention'd, that it may, by convenient Liquors, be ſo far enrich'd and advanc'd, as to be made capable of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:94784:166"/>
opening the Compact Body of Gold it ſelf, and of producing in it ſuch Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, (which yet perhaps will enrich but mens Underſtandings,) as Chymiſts are wont very fruitleſly to attempt to make in that almoſt Indeſtructible Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. But of This, having now given you a Hint, I dare here ſay no more.</p>

                  <p>THere is (<hi>Pyrophilus</hi>) another Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, which many wil find more eaſie to be put in practice, and which yet may, as to Silver, be made a kind of <hi>Succedaneum</hi> to the former, and conſequently may ſerve to ſhew, how the like Qualities in Bodies may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by differing Wayes, provided a like Change of Texture be produc'd by them. Of This I ſhall give you an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in that Preparation of Silver, that ſome Chymiſts have call'd <hi>Luna Cornea,</hi> which I ſhall not ſcruple to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:94784:166"/>
mention particularly, and apply to my preſent purpoſe; becauſe though the name of <hi>Luna Cornea</hi> be already to be met with in the Writings of ſome Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſts, yet the thing it ſelf, being not uſ'd in Phyſick, is not wont to be known by thoſe that learn Chymiſtry in order to Phyſick; and the way that I uſe in making it is differing from that of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſts, being purpoſely deſign'd to ſhew ſome notable <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> not to be met with in their way of proceeding.</p>
                  <p>We take then refined Silver, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beaten it into thin Plates, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd it in about twice its Weight of good <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> we Filtrate it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to obtain a clear ſolution, (which ſometimes we Evaporate further, till it ſhoot into Chryſtals, which we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dry upon brown Paper with a moderate heat.)</p>
                  <p>Upon the abovemention'd ſolution we drop good ſpirit of Salt, till we find, that it will no more curdle the Liquor
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:94784:167"/>
it falls into, (which will not happen ſo ſoon, as you will be apt at firſt to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,) then we put the whole Mixture in a Glaſs Funnel lin'd with Cap-paper, and letting the moiſture drain through, we dry, with a gentle heat, the ſubſtance, that remains in the Filtre, firſt waſhing it (if need be) from the looſly adhaering Salts, by letting fair Water run through it ſeveral times, whilſt it yet continues in the Filtre. This ſubſtance being well dry'd, we put it into a Glaſs Viol, which being put upon quick coals, firſt cover'd with Aſhes, and then freed from them, we melt the contain'd ſubſtance into a Maſs, which, being kept a while in Fuſion, gives us the <hi>Luna Cornea</hi> we are now to conſider.</p>
                  <p>If to make this Factitious Concrete, we firſt reduce the Silver into Chryſtals, and afterwards proceed with ſpirit of Salt, as we have juſt now taught you to do with the ſolution; we have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly Opacous, Malleable, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:94784:167"/>
Fuſible Body of Silver, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient interpoſition of ſome ſaline Particles, not amounting to the third part of the Weight of the Metal, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into Chryſtals, that both ſhoot in a peculiar and determinate figure, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from thoſe of other Metals, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are diaphanous and brittle, and by great odds more eaſily fuſible then Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſelf; beſides other Qualities, wherein having elſewhere taken notice, that theſe Chryſtals differ both from Silver and from <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> we ſhall not now inſiſt on them, but paſs to the Qualities, that do more properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the change of the Solution of Silver into <hi>Luna Cornea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt then we may obſerve, that though ſpirit of Salt be an highly acid Liquor, and though acid Liquors and <hi>Alkalys</hi> are wont to have quite contrary Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the one praecipitating what the other would diſſolve, &amp; diſſolving what the other would praecipitate: yet in our
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:94784:168"/>
caſe, as neither Oyl of Tartar <hi>per deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium,</hi> nor ſpirit of Salt will diſſolve Silver, ſo both the one and the other will praecipitate it; which I deſire may be taken notice of againſt the Doctrine of the Vulgar Chymiſts, and as a Proof, that the Praecipitation of Bodies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon acid or Alkalizate Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors as ſuch, but upon the Texture of the Bodies, that happen to be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may here obſerve, that White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Opacity may be immediately produc'd by Liquors, both of them Diaphanous and colourleſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That on the other ſide, a White Powder, though its minute parts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not tranſparent, like thoſe of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Glaſs, Roſin, &amp;c. which, by commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, are made to ſeem White, may yet, by a gentle heat, be preſently reduc'd into a Maſs indifferently Tranſparent, and not at all White, but of a fair Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:94784:168"/>4. We may obſerve too, that though Silver require ſo ſtrong a fire to melt it, and may be long kept red hot, without being brought to Fuſion; yet by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation of ſome ſaline particles, conveniently mingled with it, it may be made ſo fuſible, as to be eaſily and quickly melted, either in a thin Viol, or at the flame of a Candle, where it will flow almoſt like Wax.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It may alſo be noted, that though the Lunar ſolution and the ſpirit of Salt would, either of them apart, have readily diſſolv'd in Water; yet when they are mingled, they do, for the moſt part, concoagulate into a ſubſtance, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t will lie undiſſolv'd in Water, and is ſcarce, if at all, ſoluble either in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or in ſpirit of Salt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And remarkable it is, that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Silver being very flexible and malleable, (eſpecially if the Metal be, as ours was, refin'd) it ſhould yet, by the Addition of ſo ſmall a proportion of
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:94784:169"/>
Salt, (a Body rigid and brittle,) as is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated to it in our Experiment, be made of a Texture ſo differing from what either of its Ingredients was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being wholly unlike either a Salt or a Metal, and very like in Texture to a piece of Horn. And to ſatisfie my ſelf, how much the Toughneſs of this Metalline Horn depended upon the Texture of the <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> reſulting from the reſpective Textures of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>veral Ingredients, I praecipitated a ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Silver with the diſtill'd ſaline Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor commonly call'd Oyl of Vitriol, inſtead of ſpirit of ſalt, and having waſh'd the Praecipitate with common Water, I found agreeably to my conjecture, that this Praecipitate, being flux'd in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate heat, afforded a Maſs, that look'd like enough to the Concrete we have been diſcourſing of, but had not its Toughneſs, being brittle enough to be eaſily broken in pieces. But the tw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

do yet remain unmentiond.</p>
                  <p>For 7<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>. 'Tis odd, that whereas a ſolution of Silver is, as we have often occaſion to note, the bittereſt Liquor we have ever met with, and the ſpirit of Salt far ſowrer then either the ſharpeſt Vinegar, or even the ſpirit of it, theſe two ſo ſtrongly and offenſively taſted Liquors ſhould be ſo eaſily and ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without any other thing to correct them, be reduc'd into an inſipid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, (at leaſt ſo far inſipid, that I have lick'd it ſeveral times with my Tongue, without finding it otherwiſe, though perhaps, with much rowling it to and fro in the mouth, it may at length afford ſome unpleaſant Taſt, but exceedingly different from that of either of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors that compoſ'd it:) and This, though the Salts, that made both the Silver, and the praecipitating ſpirit ſo ſtrongly taſted, remaine aſſociated with the Silver.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And Laſtly, it is very ſtrange,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:94784:170"/>
that though the ſaline Corpuſcles, that give the efficacy both to good <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and the like ſpirit of Salt, be not onely ſo volatile, that they will eaſily be diſtill'd with a moderate fire, but ſo fugitive, that they will in part fly away of themſelves in the cold Air, (as our Noſes can witneſs to our trouble, when the Viols, that contain ſuch Liquors, are unſtopt;) yet by vertue of the new Texture they acquire, by aſſociating themſelves with the Corpuſcles of the Silver and with one another, theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute particles of ſalt looſe ſo much of their former Lightneſs, and acquire ſuch a degree of Fixedneſſe, that they will endure melting with the Metal they adhere to, rather then ſuffer themſelves to be driven away from it. Nor do I remember, that when I melted this Maſs in a thin Viol, I could perceive any ſenſible Evaporation of the Matter: nay having afterwards put a parcel of it upon a quick Coal, though that were blows
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:94784:170"/>
to intend the heat; yet it ſuffer'd Fuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo ran off from the Coal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out appearing, when it was taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to be other then <hi>Luna Cornea,</hi> as it was before.</p>

                  <p>I Am now (<hi>Pyrophilus</hi>) about to do a Thing, contrary enough both to my Cuſtome and Inclination, that is, To diſcourſe upon the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of an Experiment, which I do not teach you to make. But ſince I cannot as yet, without ſome breach of promiſe, plainly diſcloſe to you what I muſt now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal your Equity aſſures me of your Pardon.

                  <p>I ſhall not then ſcruple to tell you, that Diſcourſing one day with a very Ingenious Traveller and Chymiſt, who had had extraordinary Opportunities to acquire Secrets, of a certain odd Salt I had thought upon and made, which was of ſo differing a kind from other Salts, that though I did not yet know what Feats I ſhould be able to do with it, yet I was confident, it muſt have Noble and unuſual Operations. This Gentleman, to requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e my Franckneſs, told me, that I had lighted on a greater Jewel, then perhaps I was aware of; and that if I would follow his Advice, by adding ſomething that he nam'd to me, and proſecuting the Preparation a little further, I ſhould obtain a Salt exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:94784:171"/>
noble. I thank'd him, as I had cauſe, for his Advice, and, when I had Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, follow'd it. And though I found the vvay of making this Salt ſo nice and intricate a thing, that if I vvould, I could ſcarce eaſily deſcribe it, ſo as to enable moſt men to practice it; yet having once made it, I found, that, beſides ſome of the things I had been told it would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, I could do divers other things vvith it, vvhich I had good cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Gentleman, of whom I was ſpeaking, did not think of; and I doubt not, but I ſhould have done much more with it, if I had not unfortunately loſt it ſoon after I had prepar'd it.</p>
                  <p>Several of the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> I try'd to produce with it, which are not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for this place, are reſerv'd for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but here I ſhall mention a few, that beſt fit my preſent purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, though the ſeveral ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, that compoſ'd this Salt, were all of them ſuch, as Vulgar Chymiſts muſt
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:94784:172"/>
according to their Principles, look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as purely Saline, and were each of them far more ſalt then Brine, or more ſowr then the ſtrongeſt Vinegar, or more ſtrongly taſted then either of thoſe two Liquors; yet the Compound, made up of onely ſuch Bodies, is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eminently ſalt, or ſowr, or inſipid, that a Stranger being ask'd, what Taſt it had, vvould not ſcruple to judge it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſweet, then of any other Taſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though its Sweetneſs be of a peculiar kind, as there is a difference even among Bodies ſweet by Nature; the ſweetneſs of Sugar being divers from that of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and both of them differing from that of the ſweet Vitriol of Lead. And this is the onely inſtance, I remember, I have hitherto met vvith of Salts, that, vvithout the mixture of inſipid Bodies, compoſe a ſubſtance <hi>really ſweet.</hi> I ſay <hi>really ſweet,</hi> becauſe Chymiſts often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times terme the <hi>Calces</hi> of Metals and other Bodies <hi>dulcifi'd,</hi> if they be freed
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:94784:172"/>
from all corroſive ſalts and ſharpneſs of Taſt, <hi>ſweet,</hi> though they have nothing at all of poſitive ſweetneſs in them; and by that licence of ſpeaking do often e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough impoſe upon the Unskilful.</p>
                  <p>Another thing conſiderable in our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomalous Salt is, That though its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour be not either ſtrong or offenſive, (both which that of Volatile Salts is wont to be,) yet if it be a little urg'd with heat, ſo as to be forc'd to evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate haſtily and copiouſly, I have known ſome, that have been uſ'd to the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtink of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> diſtill'd Urine, and even ſpirit of Sal Armoniack its ſelf, that have complain'd of this ſmell, as more ſtrong, and upon that account more unſupportable then theſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and yet when theſe Fumes ſettle again into a Salt, their Odour will again prove mild and inoffenſive, if not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas all the Volatile, and Acid, and Lixiviate Salts, that we know
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:94784:173"/>
of, are of ſo determinate and ſpecificated a Nature, (if I may ſo ſpeak,) that there is no one ſort of the three, but may be deſtroy'd by ſome one or other of the other two Salts, if not by both, as ſpirit of Urine, which is a volatile Salt, being mingled with ſpirit of Salt, or <hi>Aqua for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> or almoſt any other ſtrong and acid ſpirit, will make a great Ebullition, and looſe its peculiar Taſt, and ſeveral of its other Qualities; and on the otherſide, Salt of Tartar, and other <hi>Alkalys,</hi> (that is, Salts produc'd by Incineration of mix'd Bodies,) will be deſtroy'd with Ebullition by <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> ſpirit of Salt, or almoſt any other ſtrong ſpirit of that Family. And ſpirit of Salt, <hi>Aqua for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> &amp;c. will be (as they ſpeak) deſtroy'd both by Animal volatile Salts, and by the fix'd Salts of Vegetables; that is, will make an Efferveſcence with either ſort of Salts, and compoſe with them a new Liquor or Salt, differing from either of the ingredients, and, as to taſt, ſmell,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:94784:173"/>
odour, and divers other Qualities, more languid and degenerous: whereas, I ſay, each of theſe three Families of Salts may be eaſily deſtroy'd by the other two, our Anomalous Salt ſeems to be above the being <hi>thus wrought</hi> upon by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of all the three, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the onely Body I know: (which is no ſmall priviledge, or rather prerogative,) for I did not find, that a Solution of it, made with as little Water as I could, which is the vvay whereby we uſually make it fluid, would make any Ebullition, either with Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> or ſpirit of Sal Armoniack, or ſtrong ſpirit of Salt, or even Oyl of Vitriol, but would calmely and ſilently mix vvith theſe differing Liquors, and continue as long as I had patience to look upon them, without being praecipitated by them. But this is not the onely way I imploy'd to examine, whether our Salt belong'd to any of the three above mention'd comprehenſive families of Salts. For
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:94784:174"/>
                     <hi>I</hi> found not, that the ſtrongeſt ſolution of it would turn Syrup of Violets either red, as acid ſpirits do, or green, as both fix'd and volatile Salts will do. Nor would our Solution turn a clear one of Sublimate made in common Water, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther white, as ſpirit of Urine, Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack, or others of the ſame family, or into an Orange Tawny, like ſalt of Tartar, and other <hi>Alkalys</hi>: but left the ſolution of Sublimate tranſparent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving it any of theſe colours, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it ſelf very kindly with it, as it had done with the four lately mention'd Liquors. And to ſatisfy my ſelf a little further, I not onely try'd, that an undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd mixture of ſyrup of Violets and our ſolution, would immediately be turn'd red by 2 or 3 drops of ſpirit of Salt, or green by as much Oyl of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: but, to proſecute the Experiment, <hi>I</hi> let fall a drop or two of a mixture made of our Anomalous ſolution, and ſpirit of Salt well ſhaken together, upon
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:94784:174"/>
ſome ſyrup of Violets, which was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by immediately turn'd red, and a little of the ſame Anomalous ſolution, being ſhaken together with Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> turn'd another parcel of the ſame ſyrup of Violets into a delightful green; which, hapning as <hi>I</hi> expected, ſeem'd to argue, that our Solution, though as to ſenſe it were exquiſitely mingled in the ſeveral mixtures, to which <hi>I</hi> had put it, did, as it left them their undeſtroy'd reſpective Natures, retain its own; and yet this Salt is ſo far from being a languid or an inſignificant thing, that <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol themſelves, as operative and as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Liquors as they are, are unable in divers caſes to make ſuch Solutions, and perform ſuch other things, as our calme, but powerful, Menſtruum can, though but ſlowly, effect.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly: Though this Salt be a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile one, and requires no ſtrong heat to make it ſublime into finely figur'd
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:94784:175"/>
Chryſtals without a remanence at the Bottom; yet being diſſolv'd in Liquors, you may make the Solution, if need be, to boile, without making any of the Salt ſublime up, before the Liquor be totally or almoſt totally drawn off, whereas the volatile ſalt of Urine, Bloud, Harts-horn, &amp;c. are wont to aſcend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore almoſt any part of the Liquor, they are diſſolv'd in, which is in many caſes very inconvenient.</p>
                  <p>And though this be a Volatile ſalt, yet I remember not, that <hi>I</hi> have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd any fix'd ſalt, (without excepting ſalt of Tartar it ſelf,) that runs near ſo ſoon <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> as this will do; but by abſtraction of the adventitious moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture tis eaſily reſtor'd to its former ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line form: and yet differs from ſalt of Tartar, not onely in Fixedneſſe and Taſt, and divers other qualities, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in this, That, whereas ſalt of Tartar requires a vehement fire to flux it, a gentlier heat, then one would eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:94784:175"/>
will melt our Salt into a Limpid Liquor.</p>
                  <p>And whereas ſpirit of Wine will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve ſome Bodies, as Sanderick, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, Gum-Lac, &amp;c. and Water, on the other ſide, diſſolves many that ſpirit of Wine cannot, and Oyls will diſſolve ſome, for which neither of the other Liquors are good ſolvents; our ſalt will readily diſſolve both in fair Water, in the higheſt rectifi'd ſpirit of Wine, (and That ſo little, as not to weigh more then the ſalt,) and in Chymical Oyls themſelves, with which it will aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:94784:176"/>This Operation being performable in a moderate fire, and the Bodies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being almoſt of an incorruptible nature, one would ſcarce think, that ſo ſlight a matter ſhould produce any Change in them; but yet I found, as I expected, theſe notable Mutations of Qualities effected by ſo unpromiſing a way.</p>
                  <p>For in the firſt place, we may take notice, that the Liquor, that came over, was no longer an <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or ſpirit of Nitre, but an <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> that was able to diſſolve Gold, which <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> will not meddle with, and will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve Silver, as it would have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but will rather, as I have purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly try'd, praecipitate it out of <hi>Aqua for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> if that Menſtruum have already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd it: But this Change belonging not ſo properly to the ſubſtance it ſelf I was about to conſider, I ſhall not here inſiſt on it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then, the Taſt of this Subſtance
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:94784:177"/>
comes by this Operation to be very much alter'd. For it hath not that ſtrong ſaltneſs that it had before, but taſts far milder, and, though it relliſh of both, affects the Palate much more like Salt-petre, then like common ſalt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Next, whereas this laſt nam'd Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is of very difficult Fuſion, our factiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſalt imitates ſalt-petre in being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fuſible, and it will, like Nitre, ſoon melt, by being held in the flame of a Candle.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But to proceed to a more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> tis known, that Sea-ſalt is a Body, that doth very much reſiſt the fire, when once by being brought to Fuſion, it hath been forc'd to let go that windy ſubſtance, that makes unbeaten ſalt crackle in the fire, and ſo by blowing it accidentally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it. Tis alſo known, that acid ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as thoſe of Salt, Vitriol, Nitre, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, &amp;c. are not onely not inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves, but hinderers of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:94784:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in other Bodies; and yet my Conjecture leading me to expect, that, by this Operation, I ſhould be able to produce, out of two inflammable Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, a third, that would be eaſily inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable. I found, upon Tryal, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſmall Lumps of this ſubſtance, caſt upon quick and well blown coals, though they did not give ſo blew a flame as Nitre, did yet, like it, burn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a copious and vehement flame. And, for further Tryal, having melted a pretty quantity of this tranſmuted Sea ſalt in a Crucible, by caſting upon it little fragments of well kindled Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal, it would, like Nitre, preſently be kindled, and afford a flame ſo vehement and ſo dazling, that one that had better Eyes then I, and knew not what it was, complain'd, that he was not able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſplendor of it. Nor were all its inflammable parts conſum'd at one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration: for by caſting in more frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of well kindled Coal, the Matter
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:94784:178"/>
would fall a puffing, and flame afreſh for ſeveral times conſecutively, according to the quantity that had been put into the Crucible.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But this it ſelf was not the chief diſcovery I deſign'd by this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For I pretended hereby to deviſe a way of turning an acid ſalt into an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaly,</hi> which ſeems to be one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and difficulteſt Changes, that is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally to be attempted among dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inanimate Bodies. For tis not unknown to ſuch Chymiſts as are any thing inquiſitive and heedful, how vaſt a difference there is between acid Salts, and thoſe, that are made by the combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of Bodies, and are ſometimes call'd Fix'd, ſometimes Alkalizate. For whereas ſtrong Lixiviums (which are but ſtrong ſolutions of <hi>Alkalys</hi>) will readily enough diſſolve common Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and divers other Bodies aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with Sulphur; even thoſe highly acid Liquors, <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and <hi>Aqua
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:94784:178"/>
Regis,</hi> though ſo corroſive, that one will diſſolve Silver, and the other Gold it ſelf, will let Brimſtone lye in them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolv'd I know not how long; though ſome ſay, that in proceſs of time, there may be ſome Tincture drawn by the Menſtruum from it, which yet I have not ſeen try'd; and though it were true, would yet ſufficiently argue a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity betwixt thoſe acid ſpirits, and ſtrong Alkalizate ſolutions, which will ſpeedily diſſolve the very maſſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sulphur. Beſides, tis obſerv'd by the inquiſitive Chymiſts, nor does my Experience contradict it, that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that are diſſolv'd by an acid Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum, may be praecipitated by an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalizate; and on the contrary, ſolutions, made by the latter, may be praecipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the former. Moreover, as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge, diſſolv'd in ſpirit of Vinegar, will be praecipitated by the Oyl of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> or the ſolution of its Salt; and, on the contrary, Sulphur or
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:94784:179"/>
Antimony, diſſolv'd in ſuch a ſolution, will be praecipitated out of it by the ſpirit of Vinegar, or even common Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar. Moreover, Acids and Alkali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zates do alſo differ exceedingly in taſt, and in this greater diſparity, that the one is volatile, and the other fix'd, beſides other particulars not neceſſary here to be inſiſted on. And indeed, if that were true, which is taught in the Schools, that there is a natural enmity, as well as diſparity betwixt ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as between Oyly and wateriſh ones, the Chymiſts may very ſpeciouſly teach, (as ſome of them do) That there is a ſtrange contrariety betwixt Acid and Alkalizate Salts; as when there is made an Affuſion of oyl of Tartar upon <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> or <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> to praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Gold out of the one, and Silver out of the other, their mutual Hoſtility ſeems manifeſtly to ſhew it ſelf, not onely by the noiſe, and hear, and fume, that are immediately excited by their
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:94784:179"/>
conflict, but by this moſt of all, that afterwards the two contending Bodies will appear to have mutually deſtroy'd one another, both the ſowr Spirit and the fixt Salt having each loſt its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Nature in the ſcuffle, and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with its Adverſary into a certain Third ſubſtance, that wants ſeveral of the Properties both of the ſowr Spirit and the <hi>Alkaly.</hi> Now to apply all this to the Occaſion, on which I mention'd it, how diſtant and contrary ſoever the more inquiſitive of the latter Chymiſts take <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Fixed</hi> Salts to be; yet I ſcarce doubted, but that, by our Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, I ſhould, from acid ſalts, obtain an <hi>Alkaly,</hi> and accordingly having, by caſting in ſeveral bits of well kindled coal, excited, in the melted Maſs of our tranſmuted Salt, as many Deflagrations as I could, and then giving it a pretty ſtrong fire to drive away the reſt of the more fugitive parts, I judg'd, that the remaining Maſſe would be (like the fix'd
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:94784:180"/>
Nitre I have elſewhere mention'd) of an Alkalizate nature, and accordingly having taken it out, I found it to taſt, not like Sea-ſalt, but fiery enough upon the Tongue, and to have a Lixiviate reliſh. I found too, that it would turn Syrup of Violets into a greeniſh colour, that it would praecipitate a Limpid ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Sublimate, made in fair water, into an Orange tawny Powder. I found, that it would, like other fix'd ſalts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Ebullition with acid ſpirits, and even with ſpirit of ſalt it ſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coagulate with them. Nor are theſe themſelves all the wayes I took to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the Alkalizate Nature of our tranſmuted Sea ſalt.</p>
                  <p>I did indeed conſider at firſt, that it might be ſuſpected, that this new Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalizateneſſe might proceed from the Aſhes of the injected Coals, the Aſhes of Vegetables generally containing in them more or leſſe of a fix'd Salt. But when I conſider'd too, that a pound of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:94784:180"/>
Charcoal, burn'd to Aſhes, is wont to yield ſo very little Salt, that the inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted fragments of Coal, (though they had been, which they were not) quite burn'd out in this Operation, would ſcarce have afforded two or three grains of ſalt, (perhaps not half ſo much,) I ſaw no reaſon at all to believe, that in the whole Maſs I had obtain'd (and which was all, that was left me of the Sea-ſalt, I had at firſt imploy'd,) it was nothing but ſo inconſiderable a proportion of Aſhes, that exhibited all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of an <hi>Alkaly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for further confirmation both of This, and what I ſaid a little before, I ſhall adde, that to ſatisfie my ſelf yet more, I pour'd, upon a pretty quantity of this Lixiviate ſalt, a due proportion of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> till the hiſſing and ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ceaſed, and then leaving the fluid Mixture for a good while to coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, (which it did very ſlowly,) I found it at length to ſhoot into ſaline Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:94784:181"/>
which though they were not of the figure of Nitre, did yet, by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammability and their bigneſs, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently argue, that there had been a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction made betwixt the Nitrous ſpirit, and a conſiderable proportion of <hi>Alkaly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I conſider'd alſo, that it might be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that in our Experiment twas the Nitrous Corpuſcles of the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> that, lodging themſelves in the little rooms deſerted by the ſaline Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Sea-ſalt, that paſs'd over into the Receiver, had afforded this <hi>Alkaly</hi>; as common Salt-petre, being handled after ſuch a manner, would leave in the Crucible a fix'd or <hi>Alkalizate</hi> Salt. But to this I anſwer, that as the Sea-ſalt, which was not driven over by ſo mild a Diſtillation, and ſeem'd much a greater part then that which had paſs'd over, was far from being of an <hi>Alkalizate</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſo the Nitrous Corpuſcles, that are preſum'd to have ſtay'd behind, were
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:94784:181"/>
whilſt they compoſ'd the ſpirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, of an highly volatile and acid Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and conſequently of a nature dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly oppoſite to that of <hi>Alkalys</hi>; and if by the addition of any other ſubſtance, that were no more <hi>Alkalizate</hi> then Sea-ſalt, an <hi>Alkaly</hi> could be obtain'd out of ſpirit of Nitre or <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducibleneſs of an <hi>Alkaly</hi> out of Bodies of another nature might be rightly thence inferr'd: ſo that however, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that by the intervention of our Experiment, two Subſtances, that were formerly acid, are turn'd into one, that is manifeſtly of an <hi>Alkalizate</hi> Nature, which is That we would here evince.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it may (<hi>Pyrophilus</hi>) be worth while to ſubjoyn; That to proſecute the Experiment by inverting it, we drew two parts of ſtrong ſpirit of Salt from one of purifi'd Nitre; but did not obſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the remaining Body to be any thing neer ſo conſiderably chang'd as the Sea-ſalt, from which we had drawn
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:94784:182"/>
the ſpirit of Nitre; ſince though the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Salt, that came over, did (as we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected) bring over ſo many of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles of the Nitre, that, being heated, it would readily enough diſſolve foliated Gold; yet the Salt, that remain'd in the Retort, being put upon quick Coals, did flaſh away with a vehement and halitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous flame, very like that of common Nitre.</p>

                  <p>I Come now (<hi>Pyrophilus</hi>) to an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, which, though in ſome things it be of kin to that which I have already taught you, concerning the changing of Sea-ſalt by <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> will yet afford us divers other inſtances, to ſhew, how upon the change of Texture in Bodies, there may ariſe divers new Qualities, eſpecially of that ſort, which, becauſe they are chiefly produc'd by Chymiſtry, and are wont to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:94784:182"/>
by Chymiſts, if not by Them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, may in ſome ſenſe be call'd Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
                  <p>The Body, which, partly whilſt we were preparing it, and partly when we had prepar'd it, afforded us theſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> either is the ſame that <hi>Glauberus</hi> means by his <hi>Sal Mirabilis,</hi> or at leaſt ſeems to be very like it: and whether it be the ſame or no, its various and uncommon Properties make it very fit to have a place allow'd it in this Treatiſe. Though of the many Tryals I made with it, I can at preſent find no more among my looſe Papers, then that following part of it, that I wrot ſome years ago to an Ingenious Friend, who I know will not be diſpleaſ'd, if, to ſave my ſelf ſome time, and the trouble of Examining my Memory, I annex the following Tranſcript of it.</p>
                  <p>[To give you a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what I writ to you from <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> of my Tryals about <hi>Glauber's</hi> Salt,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:94784:183"/>
though I dare not ſay, that I have made the ſelf ſame Thing, which he cals his <hi>Sal Mirabilis,</hi> becauſe he has deſcrib'd it ſo darkly and ambiguouſly, that tis not eaſie to know with any certainty what he means; yet whether or no I have not made Salt, that, as far as I have yet try'd it, agrees well enough with what he delivers of His, and therefore is like to prove either his <hi>Sal mirabilis,</hi> or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as good a one, I ſhall leave you to judge by this ſhort Narrative.</p>
                  <p>The ſtrange things that the Induſtrious <hi>Glauber</hi>'s Writings have invited Men to expect from his <hi>Sal mirabilis,</hi> in caſe he be indeed poſſeſſ'd of ſuch a thing, and the Enquiries of divers Eminent Men, who would fain learn of me, what I thought of its Reality and Nature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me, the next Opportunity I got, to take into my hands his <hi>Pars altera Miraculi Mundi,</hi> whoſe Title you know promiſes a Deſcription of this <hi>Sal Artis mirificum,</hi> as he is pleaſ'd to call it. But,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:94784:183"/>
I confeſs, I did not read it near all over, becauſe a great part of it is but a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of ſeveral entire Chapters out of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and I perceiv'd, that much of the reſt did, according to the cuſtome or Chymical Writings, more concern the Author, then the ſubject; wherefore looking upon his proceſs of making his <hi>ſal mirabilis,</hi> I ſoon perceiv'd he had no mind to make it common, ſince he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bids us upon two parts of common Salt diſſolv'd in common Water, to pour <hi>A,</hi> without telling us what that <hi>A</hi> is, wherefore reading on in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and finding that he tels us, that with <hi>B</hi> (which he likewiſe explaines not at all, nor determines the quantity of it) one may make an <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently call'd into my mind, That ſome Years before, having had Occaſion to make many Tryals, mention'd in other Tracts of mine, with Oyl of Vitriol and Salt petre, I did, among other things, make a red ſpirit of Nitre, by the help
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:94784:184"/>
onely of Oyl of Vitriol; remembring This (I ſay) I reſorted to one of my <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades's</hi> Dialogues,<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Sceptical Chymiſt.</note> and reviewing that Experiment, as I have ſet it down, I concluded, That though I had not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd the Salt petre in Water, as <hi>Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> doth his common Salt; yet ſince, on the other ſide, I made uſe of external fire, 'twas probable I might this way alſo get a Nitrous ſpirit, though not ſo ſtrong. And though by calling the Liquor, that muſt make an <hi>Aqua fortis B,</hi> whereas he had call'd that, which is to make his ſpirit of Salt and <hi>ſal mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis, A,</hi> he ſeem'd plainly to make them differing things, yet relying on the Experiment I had made, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to a ſolution of Nitre as much of the Oyl of Vitriol as I had taken laſt, though That be double the quantity he preſcribes for the making of his <hi>Sal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilis,</hi> I obtain'd, out of a low glaſſe Body and Head plac'd in Sand, an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:94784:184"/>
good <hi>Spiritus Nitri,</hi> that even before Rectification would readily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough diſſolve Silver, though it were diluted with as much of the common Water, wherein Salt-petre had been diſſolv'd, as amounted at leaſt to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or treble the weight of the Nitrous parts; the remaining Matter, being kept in the fire till it was dry, afforded us a Salt eaſily reducible (by Solution in fair Water and Coagulation) into Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline Grains, of a nature very differing both from crude Nitre, and from fixt Nitre, and from Oyl of Vitriol. For it coagulated into pretty big and well ſhap'd Grains, which, you know, fix'd Nitre and other <hi>Alkalizate</hi> Salts are not wont to do; and theſe Graines were not like the Chryſtals of Salt-petre it ſelf, long and Hexaedrical, but of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther figure, not eaſie nor neceſſary to be here deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, this Vitriolate Nitre (if I may ſo call it) would not eaſily, if at all,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:94784:185"/>
flow in the Air, as fixt Nitre is wont to do. Moreover, it was eaſily enough fuſible by heat, vvhereas fix'd Nitre doth uſually exact a vehement Fire for its Fuſion; and though crude Salt-petre alſo melts eaſily, yet to ſatisfie you how differing a ſubſtance this of ours was from That, vve caſt quick Coals into the Crucible, without being at all able to kindle it. Nay, and vvhen, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tryal, vve threw in ſome Sulphur alſo, though it did flame away it ſelf, yet did it not ſeem to kindle the Salt, that was hot enough to kindle It; much leſs did it flaſh, as Sulphur is wont on ſuch occaſions to make Salt-petre do. Add to all this, That a parcel of this white ſubſtance, being, vvithout Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, made to flow for a vvhile in a Crucible, with a bit of Charcoal for it to vvork upon, grew manifeſtly and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſented of Sulphur, and acquir'd an <hi>Alkalizate</hi> Taſt, ſo that it ſeem'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a Coal of fire upon the Tongue,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:94784:185"/>
if it were lick'd before it imbib'd any of the Aires moiſture, and (which many perhaps will, though I do not, think ſtranger) obtain'd alſo a very red colour; which recall'd to my mind, that <hi>Glauber</hi> mentions ſuch a Change obſervable in his Salt, made of common Salt, upon whoſe Account he is pleaſ'd to call ſuch a ſubſtance his <hi>Carbunculus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being invited by this ſucceſs to try, whether I could make his <hi>Sal mirabilis,</hi> notwithſtanding his intimating, as I lately told you, that it is done with a differing Menſtruum from that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Salt-petre is to be wrought upon; I obſerv'd, that where he points at a way of making his Salt in quantity without breaking the Veſſels, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, that the Materials be diſtill'd in Veſſels of pure Silver; vvhence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectur'd, that 'twas not <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or ſpirit of Nitre, that he imploy'd to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his Sea-ſalt: and that conſequently, ſince common ſpirit of Salt was too
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:94784:186"/>
weak to effect ſo great a Change, as the Experiment requires, 'twas very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he imploy'd Oyl of Sulphur, or of Vitriol, vvhich vvill ſcarce at all fret unalloy'd Silver. And however I concluded, that whatſoever the Event ſhould prove, it could not but be worth the While to try, vvhat Operation ſuch a Menſtruum vvould have upon Sea-ſalt, as I vvas ſure had ſuch a notable one upon ſalt-petre. And I remember, that formerly making ſome Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about the differing manners of Diſſolution of the ſame Concrete by ſeveral Liquors, I found, that Oyl of Vitriol diſſolves Sea-ſalt in a very odd way, (vvhich you vvill find mention'd among my promiſcuous Experiments,) vvherefore pouring, upon a ſolution of Bay-ſalt, made in but a moderate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Water, Oyl of Vitriol to the full Weight of the dry Salt, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting the Liquor in a Glaſs Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite plac'd in Sand, I obtain'd, without
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:94784:186"/>
ſtreſs of fire, beſides flegme, good ſtore of a Liquor, vvhich, by the Smel and Taſt, ſeem'd to be ſpirit of Salt. And to ſatisfie my ſelf the better, mingling a little of it vvith ſome of the ſpirit of Nitre lately mention'd, I found the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even without the Aſſiſtance of Heat, to diſſolve crude Gold. And having, for further Tryals ſake, pour'd ſome of it upon ſpirit of fermented U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, till the Affuſion ceaſ'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any Conflict, and having after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gently evaporated away the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous moiſture, there did, as I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ſhoot, in the remaining Liquor, a Salt figur'd like Combs and Feathers, thereby diſcloſing it ſelf to be much of the nature of Sal Armoniack, ſuch as I elſewhere relate my having made, by mingling ſpirit of Urine vvith ſpirit of common Salt, made the ordinary way.]</p>
                  <p>This <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> is all I can find at preſent of that Account, of vvhich I hop'd to have found much more; but
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:94784:187"/>
you will be the more unconcern'd, for my not adding divers other things, that, I remember, I try'd, as vvell before and after the vvriting the above tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd Paper, (as particularly, that <hi>I</hi> found the Experiment ſometimes to ſucceed not ill, when <hi>I</hi> diſtill'd the Oyl of Vitriol and Sea-ſalt together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the intervention of Water, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much time was ſav'd,) and alſo when <hi>I</hi> imploy'd Oyl of Sulphur, made with a Glaſs Bell, in ſtead of Oyl of Vitriol,) if <hi>I</hi> inform You, that afterwards <hi>I</hi> found, that <hi>Glauber</hi> himſelf, in ſome of his ſubſequent pieces, had deliver'd more intelligibly the Way of making what he, without altogether ſo great a Brag, as moſt think, calls his <hi>Sal mirabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> (which yet ſome very ingenious Readers of his Writings have come to Us to teach them,) and that thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of his about it, which <hi>I</hi> vvas able to make ſucceed, (for ſome <hi>I</hi> was not, and ſome <hi>I</hi> did not think fit to try)

you will find, together with thoſe of my Own, in more proper places of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papers. Onely, to apply what hath been above related to my preſent purpoſe, <hi>I</hi> muſt not here pretermit a couple of Obſervations.</p>
                  <p>And firſt we may take notice of the power, that Mixtures, though they ſeem but very ſlight, &amp; conſiſt of the ſmalleſt number of ingredients, may, if they make great changes of Texture, have, in alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Nature and Qualities of the compounding Bodies. For in our (above recited) caſe, though Sea-ſalt be a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conſiderably fix'd, requires a naked Fire to be elevated even by the help of copious additaments of beaten Bricks, or Clay, &amp;c. to keep it from Fuſion, yet the ſaline Corpuſcles are diſtill'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in a moderate Fire of Sand, whilſt the Oyl of Vitriol, by whoſe interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they acquire this volatility, though it be not (like the other) a Groſſe or (as the ſame Chymiſt ſpeaks) corporeal ſalt,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:94784:188"/>
but a Liquor, that has been already di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd, is yet, by the ſame operation, ſo fix'd, as to ſtay behind, not onely in the Retort, but, as I have ſometimes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely try'd, in much conſiderabler heats then That needs in this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be expoſ'd to. Nor onely is the oyl of Vitriol made thus far fix'd, but it is otherwiſe alſo no leſs chang'd. For when the remaining Salt has been expoſ'd to a competent heat, that it may be very drie and white, to be ſure of which, I ſeveral times do, when the Diſtillation is ended, keep the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Maſſe (taken out of the Retort and beaten) in a Crucible among quick coals, you ſhall have a conſiderable quantity (perhaps near as much as the Sea-ſalt You firſt imploy'd) of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which, though not inſipid, has not at all the taſt of Sea-ſalt, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pungent one, and much leſſe the highly corroſive acidity of Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="347" facs="tcp:94784:188"/>And the mention of this ſubſtance leads me to the ſecond particular I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to take notice of, which is a <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon</hi> to confirme what I formerly intimated, That notwithſtanding the regular and exquiſite figures of ſome Salts, they may, by the addition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bodies, be brought to conſtitute Chryſtals of very differing, and yet of curious, ſhapes. For if You diſſolve the hitherto mention'd <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> of Sea ſalt (after You have made it very dry, and freed it from all pungency of Taſt) in a ſufficient quantity of fair wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and, having filtrated the ſolution, ſuffer the diſſolv'd Body leiſurely to coagulate, You will probably obtain, as I have often done, Chryſtals of a far greater Tranſparency, then the Cubes wherein Sea ſalt is wont to ſhoot, and of a ſhape far differing from theirs, though oftentimes no leſſe Curious then that of thoſe Cubes; and, which makes mainely for my preſent purpoſe, I have
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:94784:189"/>
often obſerv'd thoſe finely figur'd Chryſtals to differ as much in ſhape from one another, as from the Graines of common Salt. And indeed <hi>I</hi> muſt not, on this occaſion, conceal from You, that whether it be to be imputed to the peculiar Nature of Sea ſalt, or (which I judge much more probable) to the great diſparities to be met with in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, that do all of them paſs for Oyl of Vitriol, whether (I ſay) it be to this, or to ſome other cauſe, that the Effect is to be imputed, I have found my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, to make the beſt ſort of <hi>Sal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilis,</hi> ſubject to ſo much incertainty, that though I have divers times ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in them, I have found ſo little Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in the ſucceſs, as made me rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon this Experiment amongſt Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ones, and almoſt weary of medling with it.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I Remember (<hi>Pyrophilus</hi>) I once made an Experiment, which, if I had had the Opportunity to repeat, and had done ſo with the like ſucceſs, I ſhould be tempted to look upon it, though not as a Lucriferous Experiment, (for tis the quite contrary,) yet as ſo Luciferous a one, as, how much ſoever it may ſerve to recommend Chymiſtry it ſelf, may no leſſe diſpleaſe Envious Chymiſts, who will be troubled, both that one, who admits not their Principles, ſhould
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:94784:190"/>
deviſe ſuch a thing, and that having found it, he ſhould not (Chymiſt like) keep it ſecret.</p>
                  <p>But to give you a plain and naked Account of this matter, that you may be able the better to judge of it, and, if You pleaſe, to repeat it, I will freely tell You, That ſuppoſing all Metals, as well as other Bodies, to be made of one Catholick Matter common to them all, and to differ but in the ſhape, ſize, moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or reſt, and texture of the ſmall parts they conſiſt of, from which Affections of Matter, the Qualities, that difference particular Bodies, reſult, I could not ſee any impoſſibility in the Nature of the Thing, that one kind of Metal ſhould be tranſmuted into another; (that being in effect no more, then that one Parcel of the Univerſal Matter, wherein all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies agree, may have a Texture produc'd in it, like the Texture of ſome other Parcel of the Matter common to them both.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="351" facs="tcp:94784:190"/>And having firſt ſuppoſ'd this, I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſider'd, That in a certain Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum, which, according to the vulgar Chymiſts doctrine, muſt be a worthleſs Liquor, according to my apprehenſion there muſt be an extraordinary efficacy in reference to Gold, not onely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, and otherwiſe alter it, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the very Texture of that ſuppoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly immutable Metal.</p>
                  <p>The Menſtruum then I choſe to try whether <hi>I</hi> could not diſſolve Gold with, is made by pouring on the rectifi'd oyl of the Butter of Antimony as much ſtrong ſpirit of Nitre, as would ſerve to praecipitate out of it all the <hi>Bezoarticum Minerale,</hi> and then with a good ſmart Fire diſtilling off all the Liquor, that would come over, and (if need be) Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hobating it upon the Antimonial pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For though divers Chymiſts, that make this Liquor, throw it away, upon Preſumption, that, becauſe of the Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, that is made by the Affuſion of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:94784:191"/>
the ſpirit to the Oyl, and the conſequent precipitation of a copious Powder, the Liquors have mutually deſtroy'd or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd each other; yet my Notions and Experience of the Nature of ſome ſuch Mixtures invites me to prize this, and give it the name of <hi>Menstruum per acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having then provided a ſufficient quantity of this Liquor, (for I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that Gold ordinarily requires a far more copious Solvent then Silver,) we took a quantity of the beſt Gold we could get, and melted it with 3 or 4 times its weight of Copper, which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal we chooſe rather then that which is more uſual among the Refiners, Silver, that there may be the leſſe ſuſpicion, that there remain'd any Silver with the Gold, after their ſeparation; this Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we put into good <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or ſpirit of Nitre, that all the Copper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolv'd, the Gold might be left pure and finely powder'd at the bottom;
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:94784:191"/>
this Operation with <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> being accounted the beſt way of refining Gold that is yet known, and not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, like Lead, to leave any Silver with it, ſince the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> takes up that Metal. And for greater ſecurity, we gave the Powder to an Ancient Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, to boile ſome more of the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum upon it, without communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him our Deſign. This highly refin'd Gold being, by a competent degree of heat, brought, as is uſual, to its Native Colour and Luſtre, we put to it a large Proportion of the <hi>Menſtruum peracutum,</hi> (to which we have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found cauſe to adde a little ſpirit of Salt, to promote the Solution,) wherein it diſſolves ſlowly and quietly enough; and there remain'd at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Glaſſe a pretty quantity (in ſhew, though not in weight) of white Powder, that the Menſtruum would not touch, and, if I much miſremember not, we found it as indiſſoluble in <hi>Aqua
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:94784:192"/>
Regis</hi> too. The Solution of Gold being abſtracted, and the Gold again reduc'd into a Body, did, upon a ſecond Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yield more of the white Powder, but not (if I remember aright) ſo much as at the firſt; now having ſome little quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Powder, twas eaſie with Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax or ſome other convenient Flux, to melt it down into a Metal, which Metal we found to be white like Silver, and yielding to the Hammer, if not to a leſs preſſure, and ſome of it, being diſſolv'd in <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> or ſpirit of Nitre, did, by the odious Bitterneſs it produc'd, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confirm us in our Expectation, to find it true Silver.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not, but you will demand (<hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophilus</hi>) why I did not make other Tryals with this Factitious Metal, to ſee in how many other Qualities I could verifie it to be Silver, but the quantity I recover'd after Fuſion was ſo ſmall, ſome of it perhaps being left either in the Flux, or in the Crucible, that I had
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:94784:192"/>
not wherewithall to make many Tryals, and being well enough ſatisfied by the viſible Properties, and the Taſt peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to Silver, both that it was a Metal, and rather Silver then any other, I was willing to keep the reſt of it for a while, as a Rarity, before I made further Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als with it; but was ſo unfortunate, as with it to looſe it in a little Silver Box, where I had ſomething of more Value, and poſſibly of more Curioſity.</p>
                  <p>You will alſo ask, why I repeated not the Experiment? to which I ſhall anſwer, that, beſides that one may eaſily enough faile in making the Menſtruum fit for my purpoſe, I did, when I had another Opportunity, (for I was long without it,) make a Second Attempt; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, according to the above mention'd Method, brought it ſo far, that there remain'd nothing but the melting of the White Powder into Silver, when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waſh'd it, I had layd it upon a piece of white Paper by the fires ſide to dry,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:94784:193"/>
being ſuddenly call'd out of my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, an ignorant Maid, that in the mean time came to dreſs it up, unluckily ſwept this Paper, as a foul one, into the fire: which Diſcouragement, together with multiplicity of Occaſions, have made me ſuſpend the Purſuit of this Experiment, till another Opportunity. But in the mean time I was confirm'd in ſome part of my Conjecture by theſe Things.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, by finding, that with ſome other Menſtruums which I try'd, and even with good <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> it ſelf, I could obtain from the very beſt Gold, I diſſolv'd in them, ſome little quantity of ſuch a White Powder, as I was ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of; but in ſo very ſmall a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the diſſolv'd Gold, that I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enough of it at once, to think it worth proſecuting Tryals with.</p>
                  <p>The other was this. That a very Experienc'd Mineraliſt, whom I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with part of what I had done,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:94784:193"/>
aſſur'd me, that an eminently Learned and Judicious perſon, that he nam'd to me, had, by diſſolving Gold in a certain kind of <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> and after by redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it into a Body, rediſſolving it again, and repeating this Operation ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often, reduc'd a very great, if not much the greater, part of an Ounce of Gold into ſuch a White Powder.</p>
                  <p>And the Third thing, that confirm'd me, was, the Proof given me by ſome Tryals that I purpoſely made; That the <hi>Menſtruum peracutum</hi> I imploy'd, had a notable Operation upon Gold, and would perform ſome things (one of which we ſhall by and by mention,) which Judicious Men, that play the great Criticks in Chymiſtry, do not think feaſible: ſo that there ſeems no greater cauſe to doubt, that the above mention'd Silver was really obtain'd out of the pure Gold, then onely this, That Men have hitherto ſo often in vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to make a real Tranſmutation
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:94784:194"/>
of Metals, (for the better or for the worſe,) and to deſtroy the moſt fix'd and compacted Body of Gold, that the one is look'd upon as an Unpracticable Thing, and the other as an Indeſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Metal.</p>
                  <p>To reflect then a little upon what we have been relating, if we did not miſtake nor impoſe upon our ſelves, (I ſay, upon our Selves, the Project being our own, and purſued without acquainting any body with our Aime,) it may afford us very conſiderable Conſequences of great moment</p>
                  <p>And in the Firſt place, it ſeems pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably reducible from hence, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Chymiſts are wont to talke ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationally enough of what they call <hi>Tinctura Auri,</hi> and <hi>Anima Auri</hi>; yet, in a ſober ſenſe, <hi>ſome ſuch thing</hi> may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, I ſay, <hi>ſome ſuch thing,</hi> becauſe as on the one hand, I would not counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance their wild Fancies about their matters, ſome of them being as unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:94784:194"/>
as the Peripateticks ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Forms, ſo, on the other hand, I would not readily deny, but that there may be ſome more noble and ſubtle Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, being duely conjoyn'd with the reſt of the Matter, whereof Gold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, may qualifie that Matter to look Yellow, to reſiſt <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit thoſe other peculiar <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> that diſcriminate Gold from Silver, and yet theſe Noble parts may either have their Texture deſtroy'd by a very pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Menſtruum, or by a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity with its Corpuſcles, then with thoſe of the remaining part of the Gold, may ſtick more cloſer to the former, and by their means be extricated and drawn away from the latter. As when (to explain my meaning by a groſs Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) the Corpuſcles of Sulphur and Mercury do, by a ſtrict Coalition, aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelves into the Body we call Vermilion, though theſe will riſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Sublimatory Veſſels, without
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:94784:195"/>
being divorc'd by the fire, and will act, in many caſes, as one Phyſical Body: yet tis known enough among Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, That if You exquiſitely mix with it a due proportion of Salt of Tartar, the parts of the <hi>Alkaly</hi> will aſſociate themſelves more ſtrictly with thoſe of the Sulphur, then theſe were before aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated with thoſe of the Mercury, whereby You ſhall obtain out of the Cinnabar, which ſeem'd intenſely red, a real Mercury, that will look like fluid Silver. And this Example prompts me to mind You, (<hi>Pyrophilus</hi>) That, at the beginning of this Paragraph, I ſaid no more, then that the Conſequence, I have been deducing, might probably be inferr'd from the Premiſes. For as tis not abſurd to think, that our Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum may have a particular Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon ſome Noble, and (if I may ſo call them) ſome Tinging parts of the Gold, ſo it is not impoſſible, but that the Yellowiſhneſs of that rich Metal
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:94784:195"/>
may proceed not from any particular Corpuſcles of that Colour, but from the Texture of the Metal; as in our lately mention'd Example, the Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar was highly Red, though the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, it conſiſted of, were Silver-colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the Sulphur but a pale Yellow; and conſequently, the Whiteneſs, and other Changes, produc'd in the new Metal we obtain'd, may be attributed not to the Extraction of any tinging Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but to a Change of Texture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Colour, as well as other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Gold did depend. But That, which made me unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the way, I firſt propoſed, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating this Change of Colour, was, That a Mineraliſt of great Veracity hath ſeveral times aſſur'd me, that a known Perſon in the Relators Country, the Netherlands, got a great deal of Money by the way of Extracting a Blew Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture out of Copper, ſo as to leave the Body White; adding, that he himſelf,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:94784:196"/>
having procur'd from a friend (to ſatisfie his Curioſity) a little of the Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, (whoſe chiefe Ingredients his friend communicated to him, and he to me,) he did, as he was directed, diſſolve Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in common <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> to reduce it into ſmall parts, and then having kept the <hi>Calx</hi> of the Powder of this Copper for ſome hours in this Menſtruum, he perceiv'd, that the clear Liquor, which was weak in Taſt, did not diſſolve the Body of the Metal, but onely extract a blew Tincture, leaving behind a very White Powder, which he quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by Fuſion into a Metal of the ſame Colour, which he found as Mallea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as before. Which I the leſſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at, becauſe the Experienc'd Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt <hi>Johannes Agricola,</hi> in his Dutch Annotations upon <hi>Poppius,</hi> mentions the making of a White and Malleable Copper in good quantities upon his own knowledge; and that of ſuch a kind of Copper, I have with pleaſure made
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:94784:196"/>
Tryal, I elſewhere relate. But of theſe matters we may poſſibly ſay more in a convenient place.</p>
                  <p>The Second thing, that ſeems dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible from our former Narrative, is, That however moſt (for I ſay not all) of the Judiciouſeſt among the Chymiſts themſelves, as well as among their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, believe Gold too fix'd and permanent a Body to be changeable by Art, inſomuch that tis a receiv'd Axiom amongſt many Eminent Spagyriſts, that <hi>facilius eſt aurum conſtruere, quàm de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruere</hi>; yet Gold it ſelf is not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeſtructible by Art, ſince Gold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acknowledg'd to be an Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Metal, a part of it was, by our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, really chang'd into a Body, that was either true Silver, or at leaſt a new kind of Metal very differing from Gold. And ſince tis generally confeſs'd, that among all the Bodies we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to obſerve near enough, and to try our skill upon, there is not any,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:94784:197"/>
whoſe Form is more ſtrictly united to its Matter then that of Gold, and ſince alſo the Operation, by which the White Powder was produc'd, was made onely by a corroſive Liquor, without violence of Fire, it ſeems at leaſt a very probable Inference, That there is not any Body of ſo conſtant and durable a Nature, but that, notwithſtanding its perſiſting inviolated in the midſt of divers ſenſible Diſguiſes, its Texture, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly its Nature may be really deſtroy'd, in caſe this more powerful and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated Agent be brought by a due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Application to work upon the Body, whoſe Texture is to be deſtroy'd.</p>
                  <p>But this Matter we elſewhere handle, and therefore ſhall now proceed to the Laſt and chief Conſectaries of our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly then, it ſeems deducible from what we have deliver'd, that there may be a real Tranſmutation of one Metal into another, even among the perfecteſt
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:94784:197"/>
and nobleſt Metals, and that effected by Factitious Agents in a ſhort time, and, if I may ſo ſpeak, after a Mechanical manner. I ſpeak not here of Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whereby one part of an Auriſick Powder is ſaid to turn I know not how many 100 or 1000 parts of an ignobler Metal into Silver or Gold, not onely becauſe, though Projection includes Tranſmutation, yet Tranſmutation is not all one with Projection, but far ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier then it: but chiefly becauſe tis not in this Diſcourſe you are to expect what I can ſay, and do think, concerning what Men call the Philoſophers Stone. To reſtrain my ſelf then to the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we are conſidering, that ſeems to teach us, that, at leaſt among inanimate Bodies, the nobleſt and conſtanteſt ſort of Forms are but peculiar Contrivances of the Matter, and may, by Agents, that work but Mechanically, that is, by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally moving the parts, and changing their Sizes, Shape, or Texture, be
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:94784:198"/>
generated and deſtroy'd; ſince we ſee, that in the ſame parcel of Metalline Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which a little before was true and pure Gold, by having ſome few of its parts withdrawn, and the reſt tranſpoſ'd, or otherwiſe alter'd in their ſtructure, (for there appears no token, that the Menſtruum added any thing to the Matter of the produc'd Silver,) or by both theſe wayes together, the Form of Gold, or that peculiar Modification which made it Yellow, indiſſoluble in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> &amp;c. is aboliſh'd, and from the new Texture of the ſame Matter, there ariſes that new Forme, or Convention of Accidents, from which we call a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Silver; and ſince Ours was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſoluble in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> but exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that exceſſively bitter Taſt, which is peculiar to Silver, there ſeems no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to think, that there needs a diſtinct Agent, or a particular Action of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Form, to produce in a Natural Body the moſt peculiar and diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:94784:198"/>
Properties. For twas but the ſame Menſtruum, devoid of Bitterneſs, that, by deſtroying the Texture of Gold, chang'd it into another, upon whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it acquir'd at once both White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in colour, Diſſolubleneſſe in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and aptneſſe to compoſe a bitter Body with it, and I know not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other new Qualities are attributed.</p>
                  <p>I know tis obvious to object, that tis no very thrifty way of Tranſmutation, inſtead of Exalting Silver to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gold, to degrade Gold to the condition of Silver. But a Tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is nevertheleſſe more or leſſe real, for being or not being Lucriferous, and ſince That may inrich a Brain, that may impoveriſh a Purſe, I muſt look upon your humour as that of an Alchymiſt, rather then of a Philoſopher, if I durſt not expect that the Inſtructiveneſs in ſuch an Experiment will ſuffice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to You. And if I could have ſatisfied my ſelf, that good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:94784:199"/>
are not miſtaken about what they affirm of the Tranſmutation of Iron into Copper, though, the Charge and Pains conſider'd, it be a matter of no Gain, yet I ſhould have thought it an Experiment of great Worth, as well as the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of Silver into Gold. For tis no ſmall matter to remove the Bounds, that Nature ſeems very induſtriouſly to have ſet to the Alterations of Bodies; eſpecially among thoſe Durable and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Immortal Kinds, in whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to their firſt Forms, Nature ſeems to have deſign'd the ſhewing her ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible by Art.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould here (<hi>Pyrophilus</hi>) conclude what I have to ſay of the Experiment, that hath already ſo long entertain'd us, by recommending to You the repetition of what I had not the Opportunity to try above once from end to end, were it not, that I remember ſomething I ſaid about the <hi>Menſtruum peracutum,</hi> may ſeem to import a Promiſe of communicating to
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:94784:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>
You ſomething of the Efficacy of that Liquor upon Gold. And therefore partly for that reaſon, and partly to make ſure, that the preſent Diſcourſe ſhall not be uninſtructive to You, I would adde, That though not onely the generality of Refiners and Mineraliſts, but divers of the moſt Judicious Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators of Chymiſtry it ſelf, hold Gold to be ſo fix'd a Body, that it can as little be Volatiliz'd as Deſtroy'd, and that upon This ground, that the proceſſes of ſubliming or diſtilling Gold to be met with in divers Chymical Books, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther myſtical, or unpracticable, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious, (in which Opinion I think them not much miſtaken;) though This, I ſay, be the perſwaſion even of ſome critical Chymiſts, yet, upon the juſt Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I had to find my Menſtruum very operative upon Gold, I attempted and found a way to Elevate it to a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable height, but far leſs proportion of Additament, then one that were
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:94784:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not fully perſwaded of the poſſibility of Elevating Gold; and though I have indeed found, by two or three ſeveral Liquors, (eſpecially the <hi>Aqua pugilum,</hi> aenigmatically deſcrib'd by <hi>Baſilius,</hi>) that the Fixedneſs of Gold is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether invincible, yet <hi>I</hi> found the Effect of theſe much inferior to that of our Mixture, touching which <hi>I</hi> ſhall relate to You the eaſieſt and ſhorteſt, though not perhaps the very beſt, manner of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying it.</p>
                  <p>We take then the fineſt Gold we can procure, and having either Granulated it, or Laminated it, we diſſolve it in a moderate heat, with a ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Menſtruum peracutum,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving carefully decanted the Solution into a conveniently ſiz'd Retort, we ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gently in a Sand-Furnace diſtill off the <hi>Menstruum,</hi> and if we have a mind to elevate the more Gold, we either pour back upon the remaining ſubſtance the ſame Menſtruum, or, which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:94784:200"/>
rediſſolve it with freſh; the Liquor being abſtracted, we urge the remaining Matter by degrees of Fire, and in no ſtronger a one, then what may eaſily be given in a Sand Furnace, a conſiderable quantity of the Gold will be Elevated to the upper part of the Retort, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall down in a Golden colour'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor into the Receiver, or, which is more uſual, faſten it ſelf to the Top and Neck in the form of a Yellow or Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Sublimate, and ſometimes we have had the Neck of the Retort inrich'd with good ſtore of large thin Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals, not Yellow but Red, and moſt like Rubies, very glorious to behold; (though even theſe being taken out, and ſuffer'd to lie a due time in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Air would looſe their ſaline Form, and run <hi>per Deliquium</hi> into a Liquor.) Nor ſee I any cauſe to doubt, but that by the Reaffuſions of freſh Menſtruum upon the dry <hi>Calx</hi> of Gold, that ſtayes behind, the whole Body of the Metal
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:94784:201"/>
may be eaſily enough made to paſs through the Retort, though, for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reaſon, I forbore to proſecute the Experiment ſo far.</p>
                  <p>But here <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> I think my ſelf oblig'd to interpoſe a Caution, as well as to give you a further Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about our preſent Experiment. For firſt I muſt tell You, that though even Learned Chymiſts think it a ſufficient proof of a true Tincture, that not onely the colour of the Concrete will not be ſeparated by Diſtillation, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Liquor will paſs over tincted into the Receiver; yet this ſuppoſition, though it be not unworthy of able men, may, in ſome caſes, deceive them. And next I muſt tell You, that whereas <hi>I</hi> ſcruple not, in ſeveral Writings of mine, to teach, That the Particles of ſolid and conſiſtent Bodies are not alwaies unfit to help to make up Fluid ones, <hi>I</hi> ſhall now venture to ſay further, That even a Liquor, made by Diſtillation,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:94784:201"/>
how volatile ſoever ſuch Liquors may be thought, may in part conſiſt of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles of the moſt compact and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Bodies in the World.</p>
                  <p>Now to manifeſt Both theſe things, and to ſhew You withall the Truth of what I elſewhere teach, <hi>That ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are of ſo durable a Texture, that their Minute parts will retain their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, notwithſtanding variety of Diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, which may impoſe, not onely upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, but upon Chymiſts themſelves</hi>; I will adde, that to proſecute the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, I dropp'd into the Yellow Liquor afforded me by the Elevated Gold, a convenient quantity of clean running Mercury, which was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately colour'd with a Golden colour'd Filme, and ſhaking it to and fro, till the Menſtruum would guild no more, when I ſuppoſ'd the Gold to be all praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated upon the Mercury, I decanted the clarifi'd Liquor, and mixing the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Amalgam</hi> (if I may ſo call it) of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:94784:202"/>
Gold and Mercury, with ſeveral times its Weight of Borax, I did, as I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, by melting them in a ſmall Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, eaſily recover the ſcatter'd Particles of the Elevated Metal, reduc'd into one little Maſs or Bead of Corporal or Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low (though perhaps ſomewhat paliſh) Gold. But yet whether the Gold, that tinged the Menſtruum, might not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Metal was reduc'd or praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated out of it, have been more ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully apply'd to ſome conſiderable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, then a bare Solution of Gold, that hath never been Elevated, may be a Queſtion, which I muſt not in this place determine, and ſome other things that I have try'd about our Elevated Gold, I have elſewhere taken notice of; Onely this further Uſe I ſhall here make of this Experiment, that, whereas <hi>I</hi> ſpeak in other Papers, as if there may be a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Gold in ſome Oars, and other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, where the Mine-men do not find any thing of that Metal, <hi>I</hi> mention ſuch
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:94784:202"/>
a thing upon the Account of the paſt Experiment and ſome Analogies. And therefore as <hi>I</hi> would not be underſtood to adopt what every Chymical Writer is pleaſ'd to fancie concerning Volatile Gold; ſo <hi>I</hi> think Judicious men, that are not ſo well acquainted with Chymical Operations, are ſometimes too forward to condemn the Chymiſts Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; not becauſe their Opinions have nothing of Truth, but becauſe they have had the ill Luck not to be warily enough propoſ'd. And to give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Opinion, that ſome Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals have a Volatile Gold, (and the like may be ſaid of Silver,) <hi>I</hi> think I may give an Account, rational enough, of my admitting ſuch a thing, by explicating it thus: That <hi>as</hi> in our Experiment, though after the almoſt total abſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Menſtruum, the remaining Body being true Gold, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in its own Nature, fix'd, yet it is ſo ſtrictly aſſociated with ſome volatile
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:94784:203"/>
ſaline Particles, that theſe, being preſs'd by the fire, carry up along with them the Corpuſcles of the Gold, which may be reduc'd into a Maſs by the admiſtion of Borax, or ſome other Body fitted to divorce the Corpuſcles of the Metal from thoſe, that would Elevate them, and to unite them into Grains, too big and ponderous to be ſublim'd; <hi>ſo</hi> in ſome Mineral Bodies there may be pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtore of Corpuſcles of Gold, ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, and ſo blended with the unfix'd Particles, that they will be carried up together with them by ſo vehement a heat, as is wont to be imploy'd to bring Oars, and even Metalline maſſes to Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And yet tis not impoſſible, but that theſe Corpuſcles of Gold, that in ordinary Fuſions fly away, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd and recover'd by ſome ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>additament,</hi> as may <hi>either</hi> work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and (to uſe a Chymical Term) mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the other parts of the Maſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing ſo upon the Gold; <hi>or</hi> by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociating
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:94784:203"/>
with the Volatile and ignobler Minerals, ſome way or other diſable them to carry away the Gold with them, as they otherwiſe may do; <hi>or</hi> by its Fixedneſs and Cognation of Nature make the diſperſ'd Gold imbody with it. On which Occaſion I remember, that a very Ingenious Man, deſiring my Thoughts upon an Experiment, which he and ſome others, that were preſent at it, look'd upon as very ſtrange, namely, that ſome good Gold, having, for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Tryal, been cuppell'd with a great deal of Lead, inſtead of being advanc'd in Colour, as in Goodneſs, was grown manifeſtly paler then before; my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture being, That ſo great a Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lead might contain divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of volatile Silver, which, meeting with the fix'd Body of the Gold, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporating therewith, was detain'd, was much confirm'd by finding, upon Enquiry, that the Gold, inſtead of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing its Weight, had it conſiderably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſ'd;
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:94784:204"/>
which did much better anſwer my Gheſs, then it did their Expectation, that made the Experiment, and were much ſurpriz'd at the Event. But this is no fit place to proſecute the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Additaments, that may be uſ'd to unite and fix the Particles of the nobler Metals, blended with volatile Bodies; though perhaps what hath been ſaid may afford ſome Hint about the matter, as well as ſome Apology for the Chymical Term, Volatile Gold: the poſſibility of which, I preſume, we have evinc'd by the latter part of this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, (in which I am ſorry I cannot remember the proportion of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Salts, that were able to Elevate the Gold;) for That I have ſeveral times made, and therefore dare much more confidently rely on it, then I can preſs You to do on the former part, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Tranſmutation, or at leaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Gold,) till You or I ſhall have Opportunity to repeat that Tryal.</p>

                  <p>THough (<hi>Pyrophilus</hi>) the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I am about to ſubjoin, may, at the firſt glance, ſeem onely to concern the <hi>production of Taſts,</hi> and be indeed one of the principal, that I deviſ'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that ſubject, and that belongs to the Notes I have made about thoſe Qualities: yet if You do not of your ſelf take notice of it, I may hereafter have Occaſion to ſhew You, that there are ſome particulars in this Experiment, that are applicable to more then Taſts. And ſince I had once thoughts (however ſince diſcouraged by the difficulties of the Attempt) to make my <hi>Notes</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend even to <hi>divers Qualities,</hi> which the <hi>operations of Chymiſts,</hi> and the <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Phyſicians</hi> have made men take notice of; (ſuch as the powers of <hi>corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, praecipitating, fixing, purging, bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering, ſtupifying,</hi> &amp;c-) <hi>I</hi> preſume You will not diſlike, that one, who had
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:94784:205"/>
thoughts to ſay ſomething even of Chymical and of Medical Qualities, if I may ſo call them, ſhould give You here an Experiment or two about more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, though <hi>particular,</hi> Affections of Bodies, when there are ſeveral things in the Experiment, that may be of a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral import</hi> to the Doctrine of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigine of Qualities and Forms.</p>
                  <p>We took then an Ounce of refined Silver, and having diſſolv'd it in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> wee ſuffer'd it to ſhoot into Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals, which being dried, we found to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the weight of the Silver by ſeveral Drachms, which accrued upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coagulation of the acid Salts, that had diſſolv'd, and were united to the Metal. Theſe Chryſtals we put into a Retort, and diſtill'd them in Sand, with almoſt as great a heat as we could give in a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer'd Iron Furnace, wherein the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was made; but there came over onely a very little ſowriſh Flegm with an ill ſent, wherefore the ſame Retort being ſuffer'd to cool, and then coated,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:94784:205"/>
it was remov'd to another Furnace, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of giving a far higher degree of Heat, namely, that of a naked fire, and in this Furnace the Diſtillation was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the ſeveral degrees of heat, till at length the Retort came to be red hot, and kept ſo for a good while; but though even by this Operation there was very little driven over, yet That ſufficiently manifeſted what we aimed at, ſhewing (namely) that a Body ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly Bitter might afford, as well as it conſiſted of, good ſtore of parts that are not at all bitter, but (which is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry differing taſt) eminently Sowr. For our Receiver being taken off even when it was cold, the contain'd ſpirit ſmoak'd out like rectify'd <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and not onely ſmelt and taſted like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua fortis,</hi> to the Annoyance of the Noſe and Tongue, but being pour'd upon Filings of crude Copper, it fell immediately to corrode them with violence, making much hiſſing, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:94784:206"/>
up thick fumes, and in a trice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, with the corroded Copper, a blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh colour, like That, which that Metal is wont to give in good <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards we took <hi>Minium</hi> and <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and made a Solution, which being filtred and evaporated, left us a <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> much like the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon made with ſpirit of Vinegar, then taking this ſweet Vitriol of Lead, (as we elſewhere call it) we endeavour'd in the formerly mention'd Sand Furnace to drive it over in a Retort; but finding That degree of fire incompetent to force over any thing ſave a little fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Liquor, we cauſ'd the Retort to be coated, and transferr'd to the other Furnace, where being urg'd with a naked Fire, it afforded at length a ſpirit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more copious then the Silver had done. This Spirit ſmoak'd in the cold Receiver as the other had, and did, like it, rankly ſmell of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and was ſo far from retaining any of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:94784:206"/>
of the Concrete that had yielded it, that it was offenſively acid, and being pour'd upon <hi>Minium,</hi> it did with noiſe and Bubbles fall upon it, and quickly afforded us a Liquor, which being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, did, by its Sweetneſs as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofs, aſſure us, that there would have needed but a gentle Evaporation (if We had leiſure to make it) to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from it a true Sugar of Lead; and tis remarkable, that the Concrete, which appear'd White before Diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, remain'd, for the moſt part, behind in the Retort in the form of a black <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> (ſometimes We have had it in a Yellowiſh Lump,) which was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at all ſweet, as the Vitriol of Lead it ſelf had eminently been, nor at all ſowr, as the Liquor, diſtill'd from it, was in a high degree, but ſeem'd rather inſipid, and was indeed but a <hi>Calx</hi> of Lead, which the heat of the fire had in part reduc'd into true and manifeſt Lead in the Retort it ſelf, as appear'd by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:94784:207"/>
Grains of ſeveral Sizes, that We met with in the <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> (the reſt of which is eaſily enough reducible by fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with a convenient flux into mallea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lead it ſelf.)</p>
                  <p>There are ſome <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of this Experiment, that We may elſewhere have Occaſion to take notice of; as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, That, notwithſtanding Silver be a Body ſo fix'd in the fire, that it will (as tis generally known) endure the Cuppel it ſelf, and though in the dry'd Chryſtals of Silver, the Salt, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to the Silver, increaſes the weight of the Metal but about a 4<hi rend="sup">h</hi> or a 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> part; yet this ſmall proportion of ſaline Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles was able to carry up ſo much of that almoſt fixedſt of Bodies, that, more then once, We have had the inſide of the Retort, to a great height, ſo cover'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with the Metalline Corpuſcles, that the Glaſs ſeem'd to be Silver'd over, and could hardly, by long ſcraping, be freed from the copious and cloſely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering Sublimate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="385" facs="tcp:94784:207"/>But the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> that I chiefly deſire to take notice of at preſent, is this, That not onely <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> being concoagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with differing Bodies, may produce very differing Concretes, but the ſame numerical Saline Corpuſcles, that, being aſſociated with thoſe of one Metal, had already produc'd a Body eminent in one. Taſt, may afterwards, being freed from that Body, compoſe a Liquor emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for a very differing Taſt; and after That too, being combin'd with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of another Metal, would with them conſtitute a Body of a very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Taſt, as oppoſite as any one can be to both the other Taſts; and yet theſe Saline Corpuſcles, if, inſtead of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Metal, they ſhould be aſſociated with ſuch a one as That, they are driven from, would therewith exhibit agen the firſt of the three mention'd Taſts. To prove all this, We took Chryſtals of refined Silver made with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and though theſe Chryſtals be, as We
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:94784:208"/>
often note, ſuperlatively bitter; yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, by a naked fire, extorted from them what Spirit we could, and found That, as we expected, extremely Acid, we put one part of it upon a few Filings of Silver, of which it readily made a Solution more bitter then Gall, and the other part of the diſtill'd Liquor We poured upon <hi>Minium:</hi> and though, whilſt it had been an Ingredient of the Chryſtals of Silver committed to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation, it did with that Metal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an exceſſively bitter ſubſtance, yet the ſame Particles, being looſned from that Metal, and aſſociated with thoſe of the Lead, did with them conſtitute a Solution, which by Evaporation affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us a <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> or a Vitriol ſweet as Sugar. And for further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, We varied the Experiment, having, in a naked Fire, diſtilled ſome dry'd <hi>Saccharum Saturni</hi> made with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> the little Liquor that came over, in proportion to the Body, that
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:94784:208"/>
afforded it, was ſo ſtrong a ſpirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, that for ſeveral hours the Receiver was fill'd with red Fumes; and though the ſmoaking Liquor were hugely ſharp, yet part of it, being pour'd upon a piece of its own <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> (in vvhich We perceiv'd not any Taſt) did at length (for it vvrought but very ſlowly) exhibit ſome little Grains of a Saccharine Vitriol, but the other part, being put upon Filings of Silver, fell upon it immediately vvith noiſe and ſtore of ſmoak, and a while after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coagulated vvith part of it (vvhich it had diſſolv'd) into a Salt exceſſively bitter.</p>

                  <p>The firſt Occaſion, afforded me to do any thing about this matter, was my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſulted by a Gentleman, (an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chymiſt, but not at all a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,) who relating to me how much he
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:94784:209"/>
had (with the wonted ſucceſs of ſuch Attempts) labour'd after the Grand <hi>Arcana,</hi> complain'd to me among other things, that, having Occaſion to imploy great quantity of purifi'd Rain-water, he obtain'd from it much <hi>leſs</hi> then he wiſh'd of the ſubſtance that he look'd for, but a <hi>great deal</hi> of a certain whitiſh excrementitious Matter, which he knew not what to make of. This gave me the Curioſity firſt to deſire a ſight of it, in caſe he had not thrown it away, (which by good fortune he had not,) and then, taking notice of the unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted plenty, and ſome of the Qualities of it, to ask him ſome Queſtions which were requiſite and ſufficient to perſwade me, that this Reſidenee came not from accidental foulneſs of the Water, nor of the Veſſels twas receiv'd in. This I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards often thought of, and indeed it might juſtly enough awaken ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, that the little Motes, that have been ſometimes obſerv'd to appear
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:94784:210"/>
numerous enough, in pure Rain water whilſt it is diſtilling, might not be meerly accidental, but really produc'd, as well as exhibited by the action of the Fire. I thought it then worth while to proſecute this matter a little farther: And having put a pretty quantity of diſtill'd Rainwater in a clean Glaſs Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and fitted it with a Head and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, I ſuffer'd it to ſtand in a Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive Furnace, till, by the gentle heat thereof, the Water was totally abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and the Veſſel left dry: which being taken out of the Sand, I found the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Glaſs all cover'd over with a white (but not ſo very white) ſubſtance; which, being ſcrap'd off vvith a Knife, appear'd to be a fine Earth, in vvhich I perceiv'd no manifeſt Taſt, and vvhich, in a vvord, by ſeveral Qualities ſeem'd to be Earth.</p>

all drawn off, afforded me more of the like Earth: but though the Repetition of the Experiment, and my having, for greater caution, try'd it all the while in a new Glaſs, that had not been imploy'd before to other uſes, confirm'd me much in my conjecture, That unleſs it could be prov'd, which I think will ſcarce be pretended, that ſo inſipid a Liquor as Rain-water ſhould, in ſo gentle a heat, diſſolve the moſt cloſe and almoſt Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructible Body of Glaſs it ſelf, (which ſuch corroſive Menſtruums as <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> are wont to leave unharm'd,) the Earthy powder, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd from already diſtill'd Rain water, might be a Tranſmutation of ſome parts of the Water into that ſubſtance, yet having unhappily loſt part of my Powder, and conſum'd almoſt all the reſt, (for I kept a little by me, which you may yet ſee,) I ſhould, till I had more frequently reiterated my Experiments, (which then I had not Opportunity to
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:94784:211"/>
do, though I had thoughts of doing it alſo with Snow-water, that I had put into Chymical Glaſſes for that purpoſe, and with liquor of melted Hail, which I had likewiſe provided,) and thereby alſo obtain'd ſome more of this Virgin Earth (as divers Chymiſts would call it) to make farther Tryals with, have retain'd greater ſuſpicions, if I had not afterwards accidentally fall'n into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this matter with a learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, vvho had dealt much in Rain-vvater, but he much confirmed me in my conjecture, by aſſuring me, that he had frequently found ſuch a White Earth, as I mention'd, in diſtill'd Rain Water, after he had diſtill'd the ſame Numerical Liquor (carefully gather'd at firſt) I know not how many times one after another, adding, that he did not find (any more then I had done) any cauſe to ſuſpect, that if he had continu'd to rediſtill the ſame portion of Water, it would have yielded him more Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="393" facs="tcp:94784:211"/>But the Odneſs of the Experiment ſtill keeping me in ſuſpence, it was not without much delight, that afterwards mentioning it to a very Ingenious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom, without his leave, I think not fit to name, well verſ'd in Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal matters, and whom I ſuſpected to have, in order to ſome Medicines, long wrought upon Rain vvater, he readily gave me ſuch an Account of his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, as ſeem'd to leave little ſcruple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Tranſmutation we have been mentioning: for he ſolemnly affirm'd to me, that having obſerv'd, as I had done, that Rain-vvater would, even after a Diſtillation or two, afford a Terreſtrial ſubſtance, which may ſometimes be ſeen ſwimming up and down in the Limpid Liquor, he had the Curioſity, being ſettled and at leiſure, to try how long he could obtain this ſubſtance from the Water. And accordingly having freed Rain Water, carefully collected, from its accidental, and as it vvere faeculent
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:94784:212"/>
Earthineſs, vvhich it vvill depoſite at the firſt ſlovv Diſtillation, (and vvhich is oftentimes colour'd, vvhereby it may be diſtinguiſh'd from the White Earth made by Tranſmutation,) he rediſtill'd it in very clean Glaſses, not onely 8 or 10 times, but neer 200, vvithout find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Liquor grevv weary of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording him the White Earth, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the Corpuſcles of it did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear far more numerous, or at leaſt more conſpicuous in the latter Diſtillation, then in the former. And vvhen I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed my Curioſity to ſee this Earth, he readily ſhevv'd me a pretty quantity of it, and preſented me vvith ſome, vvhich comparing vvith vvhat I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of mine, I found to be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding like it, ſave that it vvas more purely White, as having been, for the main, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded by Rain Water, that had been more frequently rectify'd. And to compare this welcome Powder with That I made my ſelf, I try'd with This
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:94784:212"/>
divers things, which I had before try'd with my own, and (becauſe the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty preſented me was leſs inconſiderable) ſome others too. For I obſerv'd in this new Powder, as I had done with my Own, that being put into an excellent Microſcope, and plac'd where the Sun beams might fall upon it, it appear'd a White Meal, or heap of Corpuſcles ſo exceeding, not to ſay unimaginably, ſmall, that, in two or three choice Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcopes, both I and others had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to admire it; and their extreme Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs was much more ſenſibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern'd, by mingling ſome few Grains of Sand amongſt them, which made a Mixture that look'd like that of Pibble ſtones, and of the fineſt Flower. For our Earth, even in the Microſcope, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to conſiſt of as ſmall Particles, as the fineſt Hair-powder to the naked Eye. Nor could We diſcern this Duſt to be tranſparent, though, when the Sun ſhin'd upon it, it appear'd in the Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:94784:213"/>
to have ſome Particles a little gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering, which yet, appearing but in a glaring light, we were not ſure to be no <hi>deceptio viſûs.</hi> 2. I found, that our White Powder, being caſt into Water, would indeed for a while diſcolour it by ſomewhat Whitening it, which is no more then Spaud will do, and the fine duſt of white Marble, and other ſtones, whoſe Corpuſcles, by reaſon of their Minuteneſs, ſwimme eaſily for a while in the Water, but when it was once ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the bottom, it continu'd there undiſſolv'd (for ought I could perceive) for ſome dayes and nights, as Earth would have done. 3. Having weigh'd a quantity of it, and put it into a new clean Crucible, with another inverted over it for a Cover, I plac'd it among quick Coals, and there kept the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible red hot for a pretty while, cauſing the Fire afterward to be acuated with a blaſt of a Bellows, but taking out the Powder, I neither found it melted, nor
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:94784:213" rendition="simple:additions"/>
clotted into lumps, nor, when I weigh'd it again, did I ſee cauſe to conclude that there was much of it waſted, beſides what ſtuck to the ſides of the Crucible, and to a little Clay, vvherewith I had luted on the Cover, and which (to ſhew you, that the Heat had not been incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable) was in ſeveral places burnt red by the vehemence of the fire; and when <hi>I</hi> afterwards kept this Powder in an open Crucible among glowing coals, neither I, nor one that <hi>I</hi> imploy'd to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt me, perceiv'd it all to ſmoak; and having put a little upon a quick Coal, and blown That too, <hi>I</hi> found that which <hi>I</hi> had not blown away, to remain fix'd (which ſome Bodies will not do) upon quick Coals, that will endure the fire in a red hot Crucible. 4. <hi>I</hi> found this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be much heavier <hi>in ſpecie</hi> then VVater. For imploying a nice pair of Gold Scales, and a Method that would be too long here to deſcribe, <hi>I</hi> found that this Powder weigh'd ſomevvhat
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:94784:214"/>
(though not much) more then twice ſo much common VVater, as vvas equal to it in Bulk. And leaſt ſome Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that ſeem obviouſly contain'd in the common, but groundleſs, conceipts of the Peripateticks, about the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Elements in Denſity &amp;c. ſhould make you expect, that this povv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ought to have been much more ponderous, <hi>I</hi> ſhall adde, that having had the Curioſity, vvhich <hi>I</hi> wonder no body ſhould have before me, to examine the Gravity of the Earth, which ſeems the moſt Elementary of any we have, I took ſome ſifted Wood-aſhes, which I had cauſ'd to be three or four times boyl'd in a plentiful proportion of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to free them from Salt, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put them very dry into common Water, I found them but little heavier then our newly mention'd Powder, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing in weight Water of the ſame Bulk but twice, and a little more then a 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part, (Water and It being very little
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:94784:214"/>
more then as 1 to 2 1/6.) And that you may the leſs doubt of this, I will yet ſubjoyn, that, examining the Specifick Gravity of (white) Glaſs it ſelf, I found that compact Body to be very little, if at all more then 2 times and a half as heavy as Water of equal Bigneſs to it. So that the Gravity of that Powder, which, borrowing a Chymical term, we have been calling Virgin-Earth, being added to its Fixtneſs, and other Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it may ſeem no great impropriety of Speech to name it Earth, at leaſt, if by Earth we mean not the pure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Earth of the Schools, which many of themſelves confeſſe not to be found actually ſeparate, but a Body dry, cold, ponderous, induring the fire, and, which is the main, irreſoluble by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Fire into other Bodies ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally different.</p>
                  <p>[But to return to the Guiſe of the Powder, when I ask'd this Learned man, whether he obſerv'd the Glaſs he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd

in to have been fretted by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and whether This loſt of its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, according as it depoſited more Powder, He anſwer'd me, (and he is a Perſon of unſuſpected Credit,) that he found not his Glaſs to have been injur'd by the Liquor, and that the Water wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted (though he were carefull it ſhould not do ſo by Evaporation and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions) by degrees ſo much, that there remain'd, by his aeſtimate, but about an 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of the firſt quantity: and though, for certain reaſons, he kept by him the Liquor laſt diſtill'd, yet he doubted not, but that it might be very nigh totally brought into Earth, ſince out of an Ounce of diſtill'd Rain-water he had already obtain'd near 3 quarters of an Ounce, if not more, of the often mention'd Earth.]</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſeveral Relations will, <hi>I</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, perſwade You, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that this Experiment is hopeful enough to be well worth your purſuing, if not that

perhaps none but ſuch a ſcrupulous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as I, would think the proſecution of it other then ſuperfluous. And if You do acquieſce in what hath been already done, you will, I preſume, think it no mean confirmation of the Corpuſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Principles, and <hi>Hypotheſes.</hi> For if, contrary to the Opinion that is ſo much in requeſt among the generality of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Phyſicians and other Learned Men, that the Elements themſelves are tranſmuted into one another, and thoſe ſimple and Primitive Bodies, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is preſum'd to have intended to be the ſtable and permanent ingredients of the Bodies ſhe compounds here below, may be artificially deſtroy'd, and (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the intervention of a Seminal and Plaſtick power) generated or produc'd: if, <hi>I</hi> ſay, this may be done, and that by ſuch ſlight means, why may We not think, that the Changes and Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſes, that happen in other Bodies, which are acknowledg'd by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns

other things, how by the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of two diſtill'd Liquors digeſted together, I have obtain'd good ſtore of an inſipid Subſtance, that would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in Water, and that would long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough indure no inconſiderable degree of Fire; though, I ſay, by theſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch particulars, I could make our Atomiſts conjectures leſſe improbable, yet the full diſquiſition of ſo difficult a Subject is too long and intricate to be proper for this place.<note n="*" place="bottom">What is here delivered may be, for the main, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd by what the Reader will meet with in the (follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) Xth.

                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, without here exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Atomiſts explication of this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis,</hi> we will give him leave for a vvhile to ſuppoſe the Tranſmutation it ſelf to be real, and thereupon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether the Hiſtorical part of it do not much disfavour ſome of the chief Doctrines of the Chymiſts, and a
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:94784:217"/>
fundamental one of <hi>Helmonts.</hi> For if the pureſt Water may be turn'd into Earth, it will not be eaſie to make it improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the other Ingredients of mixt Bodies, which the Chymiſts call their Hypoſtatical Principles, are capable of being tranſmuted into one another, which would overthrow one of the main Foundations of their whole Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; and beſides, if out of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt Water it ſelf, a moderate fire can produce a large proportion of Earth, that was not formally praeexiſtent in it, how ſhall We be ſure, that in all the <hi>Analyſes,</hi> which the Fire makes of mixt Bodies, the Subſtances thereby exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted are obtain'd by Separation onely, without any Tranſmutation? As for <hi>Helmont,</hi> tis well enough known, that he makes Water to be the Material Principle of all Bodies here below, which he vvould have to be either Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelf, or but Water diſguiſ'd by thoſe Forms, vvhich the Seeds of
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:94784:218"/>
things have given it. I will not here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, whether this Opinion, if he had reſtrain'd it to Animals and Vegetables, might not, with ſome reſtriction and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations, be kept from appearing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, ſince my <hi>Eleutherius</hi> hath (though without abſolutely adopting it) elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhere pleaded for its not being ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, as it hath been thought.</p>
                  <p>But whereas <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Grand Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Experience is grounded on this, That the Alkaheſt doth, as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, by being digeſted with, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd from other tangible Bodies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them all at laſt into a Liquor, no way differing from Rain Water, though we ſhould grant the matter of fact, yet the Experiment of our Powder will warrant me to queſtion their Ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For if all mix'd Bodies be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concluded to be materially from Water, becauſe they are, by the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fire, and a Menſtruum, after having paſs'd through divers praevious
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:94784:218"/>
Changes, reduc'd at length into inſipid Water; by the ſame way of arguing (and with greater cogency) I might conclude, that all thoſe Bodies are materially but diſguiſ'd Earth, ſince without interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Seminal Principle, (for <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> will not allow that Title to Fire, which he ſtiles the Artificial Death of Things) Water it ſelf may be turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Earth. Indeed if that acute Chymiſt were now alive, and had ſuch an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Liquor, as he deſcribes his <hi>Alkaheſt</hi> to be, I would gladly put him upon try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether that Menſtruum would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our White Earth into Water. But there being no more probability of that, then that ſuch reproduc'd Water, being juſt what it vvas before, might be turn'd into Earth again; it may be probably ſaid, that ſince theſe Bodies are mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convertible into one another, (and, as to the verſion of Water into Earth, by a ſeemingly ſlight Operation,) they are not either of them ingenerable and
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:94784:219"/>
incorruptible Elements, much leſs the ſole matter of all tangible Bodies, but onely two of the Primordial, and of the moſt obvious Schematiſms of that, which is indeed the univerſal Matter, vvhich, as it comes to have its minute Particles aſſociated after this or that manner may, by a change of their Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Motion, conſtitute, with the ſame Corpuſcles, ſometimes Water, and ſometimes Earth.</p>
                  <p>But (<hi>Pyrophilus</hi>) to leave theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, to return to the bold Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures that they are grounded on; though if I had leiſure and indulgence enough, I could, I confeſs add many things in favour of ſome of thoſe Thoughts:<note n="*" place="bottom">Of the poſſible wayes of turning Liquors into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent Bodies, by bending, breaking, twiſting, and by otherwiſe changing the Texture of the Liquor, ſee more particularly the <hi>Hiſtory of Fluidity and Firmneſſe,</hi> publiſhd by the Author.</note> yet I would not have you wonder, that, whilſt I vvas mentioning

                  <p>For 1.

It were alſo fit to know, whether the Glaſs Body, wherein all the Diſtillations are made, do looſe of its VVeight any thing neer ſo much, as the obtained Powder amounts to, over and above the Decrement of VVeight, which may be imputed to the action of the Heat upon the ſubſtance of the Glaſs, in caſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by another Glaſs, kept empty in an equal heat, and for the ſame time that the Glaſs looſes by ſuch Operations any thing worth reckoning.

Nor muſt I forget, that ſometimes I have excited ſuch an Ebullition, by powring the ſame Liquors upon the Earthy part of Wood-aſhes, ſeveral times waſh'd in
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:94784:222"/>
boyling water, (though, I confeſs, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſomewhat ſuſpected there might remain ſome little adhering <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaly,</hi> which might occaſion thoſe Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, notwithſtanding that both I and another, whom I alſo invited to taſt it, took the Earth to be quite Saltleſſe.) I might (<hi>Pyrophilus</hi>) adde, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo me thought I found this Powder (which yet likewiſe ſometimes hapned to me with the lately mention'd Earth of Wood-aſhes) ſomewhat gritty between my Teeth, and ſubjoin divers other particulars, if it were not too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to mention to You all the doubts and conſiderations that have occurr'd to me about the recited Change of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Earth: which yet are not ſuch as ought to hinder me from giving You the Hiſtorical account <hi>I</hi> have ſet down, ſince to ſome of my Scruples <hi>I</hi> could here give plauſible Anſwers, but that <hi>I</hi> cannot do it in few words. And if any part of our white Powder prove to be
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:94784:222"/>
true Earth, no body perhaps yet knows to what the Experiment may lead ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Men: and whether in a ſtrict ſenſe it be true Earth or no, yet the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> that are exhibited in the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it, are ſufficient to give this 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Experiment a place among the others (of the ſame Decad) with which tis aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated. For ſince out of a ſubſtance that is univerſally acknowledg'd to be Elementary and Homogeneous, and which manifeſtly is fluid, tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, much lighter <hi>in ſpecie</hi> then Earth, moiſt and fugitive, there is artificially generated or obtain'd a Subſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, vvhite, and conſequently opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, comparatively ponderous, dry, and not at all fugitive; the Alteration is ſo great, and effected in ſo ſimple a way, that it cannot but afford us a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inſtance of what the varied Texture of the minute parts may perform in a Matter confeſſedly ſimilar. And if fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſtill'd Rain Water ſhould not
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:94784:223"/>
be allow'd Homogeneous, our Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment will at leaſt ſhew as, better then perhaps any hath yet done, how little we are bound to believe what the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, and others tell us, when they pretend manifeſtly to exhibit to us Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous Principles, and Elementary Bodies, and how difficult it is to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain when a Body is abſolutely iireſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble into ſpecifically differing ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and conſequently what is the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate number of the perfectly ſimple Ingredients of Bodies: (ſuppoſing that ſuch there are.) Though I muſt confeſs, that my onely aime is not to Relate what hath been done, but to Procure the proſecution of it. For if the obtain'd Subſtance be, by the Rain Water, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd out of the Glaſſe, this will both prove a noble and ſurprizing Inſtance of what may be one by inſipid Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums, even upon Bodies that are juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckon'd among the compacteſt and moſt indiſſoluble that we know of, and
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:94784:223"/>
may afford us many other conſiderable hints, that have been partly intimated already: and if on the other ſide, this Powder, whether it be true Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Earth or not, be found to be really produc'd out of the Water it ſelf, it may prove a <hi>Magnale</hi> in Nature, and of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſequence then will be preſently foreſeen, and may make the Alchymiſts hopes of turning other Metals into Gold, appear leſs wild, ſince that by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally evincing, that two ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Qualities to be introduc'd into a Body, is conſiderable degrees of Fixity &amp; Weight, (whoſe requiſiteneſſe to the making of Gold are two of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal things, that have kept me from ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily expecting to find the Attempts of Alchymiſts ſucceſſeful,) may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mixture of a Homogeneous Matter, be generated in it, by varying the Texture of its parts.</p>
                  <p>I will not now adventure to adde any thing of what I have been attempting
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:94784:224"/>
about the tranſmuting (without addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) of pure Alkalizate Salts into Earth, becauſe I do not yet know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Tryals will anſwer my Hopes: (for I do not yet call them my Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations.) But upon this ſubject of Tranſmutations, I could, if it did not properly belong to another Treatiſe, tell you ſomething about the Changes, that may be wrought upon highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify'd Spirit of Wine, vvhich vvould perchance make You think of other things of the like kind leſſe infeaſible. For vvhereas tis a known thing, that That ſpirituous Liquor being kindled, (and that, if you pleaſe, by other Spirit of Wine actually fir'd) will, for ought appears, burn all away, that is, be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally turn'd into flame; if <hi>I</hi> durſt rely, in ſo important a caſe, on a couple of Tryals, whilſt I hope for an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of making farther ones, I would tell You, that by a way unthought on (that <hi>I</hi> know of) by any Body, I have,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:94784:224"/>
vvithout any addition, obtain'd, from ſuch Spirit of Wine, as, being kindled in a Spoon, would flame all away, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving the leaſt drop behind it, a conſiderable quantity of downright incombuſtible Flegm. And by another way (mention'd indeed by <hi>Helmont,</hi> but not taught to almoſt any of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) ſome Ingenious Perſons, that you know and eſteem, vvorking by my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, (but vvithout knowing vvhat each other vvas doing) did both of them reduce conſiderable quantities of high rectify'd Spirit of Wine (that vvould before have burnt all away) into a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, that was for the moſt part flegm, as I vvas inform'd as well by my own taſt, as by the Tryals I order'd to be made: (being forc'd my ſelf to be moſt commonly abſent.) From which change of the greateſt part of that at firſt liquid Splrit into Flegm, it ſeems deducible, that the ſame portion of Matter, vvhich, by being kindled, may be turn'd all into
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:94784:225"/>
Fire, may be, by another vvay of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, turn'd into Flegm or Water, and this vvithout the addition of any thing, and vvithout being vvrought upon by any viſible Body, but one ſo extremely dry as duely prepar'd Salt of Tartar; and that it ſelf is not ſo indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the obtaining of flegm out of totally inflammable Spirit of Wine, but that, as I was ſaying, I did, by another way, obtain that dull Liquor vvithout imploying the Salt, or any other viſible Body vvhatſoever. But I make a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to entertain you any longer with Extravagances of this Nature, and yet, if I were ſure You vvould contain your ſmiles, I would adde for concluſion, That, if I had had time and Opportunity to furniſh my ſelf with any quantity of that Water, I had it in my thoughts to try, vvhether that vvould have afforded me ſuch a Terreſtrial ſubſtance, as Rain Water had done, and thereby have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone a new and further <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis.</hi>

                  <head>The X. Experiment.</head>
                  <p>THere is one Experiment more, two of the chief <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of vvhich belong to another Diſcourſe; (vvhere I particularly mention Them,) and yet I ſhall conclude this little Treatiſe vvith the recitation of the Experiment it ſelf, not onely becauſe divers of the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> do eminently belong to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſubject, but becauſe I have ſcarce met vvith any Experiments more ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Deſign I have of ſhevving, before I conclude this Diſcourſe, vvhat great and ſudden Productions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of Qualities may be effected by the compoſition of the ſmalleſt Number of Ingredients, even among Liquors themſelves, and ſuch too as are believ'd to be both of Them ſimple and Homogeneous, and incapable of Putrefaction, that ſo it may appear, what notable Alterations of Qualities
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:94784:226"/>
even ſeemingly ſlight and eaſie mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can perform among Bodies, both of them fluid, as well as among thoſe that were either both of them ſtable, or one of them ſtable, and the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent.</p>
                  <p>Take then of good Oyl of Vitriol, and of Spirit of Wine, that will burn all away, equal parts, not in quantity, but in Weight; put them together by little and little, and having plac'd the Mixture in a Bolt-head, or Glaſs Egg with a long neck, and carefully ſtopp'd it with a Cork and hard Wax, ſet the Veſſel in a moderate heat to digeſt for a competent while; (two or three weeks may do well,) then pour out the Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into a tall Glaſs Cucurbite, to which lute on a Head and a Receiver with extraordinary care, to prevent the Avolation of the Spirits, which will be very ſubtle: then with a very gentle fire abſtract the ſpirit of Wine, that will firſt aſcend, and when the Drops begin to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:94784:226"/>
come over ſowriſh, ſhift the Receiver, and continue the Diſtillation with great care, that the Matter boyl not over, and when you judge that about half the acid Liquor is come over, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, though it be not neceſſary, to change the Receiver once more; but whether you do this or no, your Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation muſt be continued, increaſing the fire towards the latter end, till you have brought over all you can, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the bottom of the Cucurbite muſt be put into a Glaſs well ſtopp'd, to keep it from the Air.</p>
                  <p>N B. 1. That to the Production of moſt, if not of all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of this Experiment, it is not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that ſo long a Digeſtion, (not to ſay, not any,) be premiſ'd; though if the time above preſcrib'd be allow'd, the Experiment will ſucceed the better.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That, I remember, I have ſometimes made uſe of Oyl of Sulphur <hi>per Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panam</hi> (as they call it) inſtead of Oyl of
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:94784:227"/>
Vitriol, to produce the recited <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>; and though the Attempt ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not ill, as to divers particulars, yet I afterwards choſe rather to imploy oyl of Vitriol, both becauſe it did, in ſome points, better anſwer my Expectation then the other Liquor, and becauſe I would not give occaſion to ſuſpect, that the Odours, hereafter to be mention'd as <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of our Experiment, were due to the common Sulphur, whence the unctuous Liquor, made <hi>per Campanam,</hi> was obtain'd, as ſuch, and did no way proceed from the acid Vitriolate Salt, which that Oyl (as tis improperly call'd) doth abound with.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That I had likewiſe the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to digeſt Oyl of Vitriol with Spaniſh Wine, inſtead of Spirit of Wine, by which means I obtain'd an odd Spirit, and reſidence, and ſome other <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which I content my ſelf to have in this place given hint of, in regard that Wine being a Liquor of a much leſs ſimple nature then its Spirit,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:94784:227"/>
the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> afforded me by This, are much fitter for my preſent purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That great care muſt be had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating the fire, when once a good part of the Acid ſpirit, mention'd in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, is come over. For if the Fire be not increaſ'd, the reſt will ſcarce aſcend, and if it be increaſ'd but a little too much, the Matter will be more apt, then one would ſuſpect, to ſwell exceedingly in the Cucurbite, and perhaps run over into the Receiver, and ſpoil what it finds there, as it hath more then once hapned to me, when I was fain to commit the management of the Fire to others.</p>
                  <p>Now the oyl of Vitriol, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, being both of them diſtill'd Liquors, and the Latter of them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times rediſtill'd, and one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn from ſo ſimple and familiar a ſubſtance as Wine, and the other from a Concrete not more compounded, then what Nature her ſelf (which, as I elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were ſhew, can, without the help of Art,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:94784:228"/>
produce Vitriol) doth divers times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us with; theſe Liquors, I ſay, being both or them diſtill'd, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly volatile, one would expect, that by diſtilling them, they ſhould be brought over united, as I have tryed, that the ſpirit of Wine, and of Nitre, or alſo of common Salt may be; and as the ſpirits of differing Vegetables are wont to be; or that, at leaſt, the Diſtillation ſhould not much alter them, from what it found them, after they had been well mingled together. But this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, theſe two Liquors being of very odd Textures in reference to each other, their conjunction and diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will make them exhibit divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and perhaps ſurprizing <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Firſt, whereas ſpirit of Wine has no great Sent, nor no good one, and moderately deflegm'd Oyl of Vitriol is wont to be inodorous; the Spirit, that firſt comes over from our mixture, hath
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:94784:228"/>
a Sent not onely very differing from ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine but from all things elſe, that. I remember, I ever ſmelt. And as this new Odour doth to almoſt all thoſe, whoſe Opinions I have asked about it, ſeem very fragrant and pleaſant, ſo I have ſometimes had it ſo exceeding ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that, in ſpight of the care that was taken to lute the Glaſſes exactly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it would perfume the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring parts of the Laboratory, and would not afterwards be kept in by a cloſe Cork, cover'd with two or three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bladders, but ſmell ſtrongly at ſome diſtance from the Viol wherein it was put, I did not think it unlikely, that ſo noble and piercing a Liquor might be of no mean efficacy in Phyſick; and though I miſs'd of receiving an account of its Effects from ſome ingenious Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, into whoſe Hands I put it to have Tryals made of it, yet I cannot deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of finding it a conſiderable Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, when I remember, partly what
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:94784:229"/>
hath been done by ſome acquaintances of mine with bare flegme of Vitriol, upon the account (as is ſuppoſ'd) of that little Sulphur of Vitriol, that, though but ſparingly, doth inrich that Liquor; and partly, what the Maſters of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical <hi>Arcana</hi> tell us of the wonderful vertues of the Volatile Sulphur of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, and what I have obſerv'd my ſelf, that may invite me to have a good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Remedies of that nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But to ſhevv how much the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of Bodies depend upon their Texture, I ſhall now adde, That after this volatile and odoriferous Spirit is come over, and has been followed by an Acid Spirit, it will uſually, towards the latter end of the Diſtillation, be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a Liquor, that is not onely not fragrant, but ſtinks ſo ſtrongly of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, that <hi>I</hi> have ſometimes known it almoſt take away the Breath (as they ſpeak) of thoſe, who, when I had the Receiver, newly taken off, in my hand,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:94784:229"/>
did (either becauſe to make ſport I gave them no vvarning, or becauſe they would not take it, as thinking what <hi>I</hi> told them impoſſible,) too boldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture their Noſes in the Tryal.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is in this Operation produc'd a Liquor, that will not mingle either with the fragrant, or with the foetid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hitherto deſcrib'd, but is very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from both of them, and is ſo very pleaſant, ſubtle, and Aromatical, that it is no leſs differing as well from Spirit of Wine, as Oyl of Vitriol. But of this Liquor I give a further Account in a more convenient place.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When the Diſtillation is carried on far enough, You will find at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, that the two above mention'd Diaphanous Spirits (for Oyl of Vitriol is indeed rather a Saline Spirit, then an Oyl) have produc'd a pretty Quantity of a Subſtance, not onely very opacous, but black almoſt like Pitch or Jet.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And this Subſtance, though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:94784:230"/>
by two Bodies, that were not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fluid, but diſtill'd, will not alone be conſiſtent, but (if the Diſtillation have been urg'd far enough) brittle.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And though Spirit of Wine be reputed the moſt inflammable, and Oyl of Vitriol the moſt corroſive Liquor that is known, yet I could not find, that this black Subſtance would eaſily, if at all, be brought, I ſay not to flame, but to burn; nor that it had any diſcernible Taſt, though both the Liquors, from whoſe mixture it was obtain'd, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeeding ſtrong and pungent Taſts.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And whereas both Oyl of Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol and Spirit of Wine will each of them more readily, then moſt Liquors that are yet known, mingle with common Water, and diffuſe it ſelf therein, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that this pitchy Maſs, if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation had been continued till it was perfectly dry, would not, that I could perceive, diſſolve in common water for very many hours, and, if I much miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:94784:230"/>
not, for ſome dayes.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And Laſtly, whereas the Oyl of Vitriol, and the Spirit of Wine, were both of them diſtill'd Liquors, and one of them exceeding volatile and fugitive; yet the black Maſs, produc'd by them, was ſo far fix'd, that I could not make it riſe by a conſiderably ſtrong and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting fire, that would have raiſ'd a much more ſluggiſh Body, then the heavieſt of thoſe that concurr'd to produce it.</p>
                  <p>The remaining particulars, that I have obſerv'd in this Experiment, belong to another Treatiſe, and therefore I ſhall forbear to mention them in this: nor ſhall I at preſent adde any new <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> to thoſe I have already recited; thoſe freſhly mention'd Experiments, and thoſe that preceded it, being, even without the aſſiſtance of the four Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations I have delivered before them, ſufficient to manifeſt the Truth I have been endeavouring to make out, For in the Experiments we are ſpeaking of,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:94784:231"/>
it cannot well be <hi>pretended,</hi> or at leaſt not well <hi>prov'd,</hi> that any Subſtantial Forms are the Cauſes of the Effects I have recited. For in moſt of the (above mention'd) caſes, beſides that, in the Bodies we imploy'd, the Seminal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, if they had any before, may be ſuppoſ'd to have been deſtroy'd by the fire, they were ſuch, as thoſe I argue with would account to be <hi>Factitious</hi> Bodies, artificially produc'd by Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Operations. And tis not more manifeſt, that, in the production of theſe Effects, there intervenes a Local Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and change of Texture by theſe Operations, then tis inevident and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious, that they are the Effects of ſuch things, as the Schools fancy Subſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Forms to be: ſince tis, in theſe new Experiments, by the Addition of ſome new particles of Matter, or the Receſs, or Expulſion of ſome praeexiſtent ones, or, which is the moſt frequent way, by the Tranſpoſition of Minute parts, yet
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:94784:231"/>
without quite excluding the other two, that no more skilful a Chymiſt then I have been able to produce by Art a not inconſiderable number of ſuch changes of Qualities; that more notable ones are not ordinarily preſented us by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where ſhe is preſumed to work by the help of Subſtantial Forms; I ſee not, why it may not be thought probable, that the ſame Catholick and fertile Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Motion, Bulk, Shape,</hi> and <hi>Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the Minute parts of <hi>Matter,</hi> may, under the Guidance of Nature, (whoſe Laws the modern Peripateticks acknowledge to be eſtabliſh'd by the all-wiſe God,) ſuffice likewiſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe other Qualities of Natural Bodies, of which we have not given par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Inſtances.</p>
