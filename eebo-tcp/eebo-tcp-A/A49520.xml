            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </head>
            <p>IN theſe following Dialogues, I have not pretended to inquire whether the Author of <hi>Pax Vobis,</hi> has in his Dialogues fairly repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe of the Reformation; being reſolved to ſee where the mighty ſtrength of that piece of Reaſoning lay, upon ſuppoſition that all the Sayings and Matters of Fact, which he charges upon Proteſtants, were juſt as he has reported them. I fancy it will come into ſome bodies head or other, to take a little pains about that. But be it ſo or not, I
<pb facs="tcp:34208:3"/>
am apt to think it will be allowed by every unprejudiced Perſon, That a ſufficient Reply is here given to the great deſign and buſineſs of that Book; and that for the future, it is not likely to impoſe upon any, who are not very weak in their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, or ſomething that is much worſe.</p>
            <p>As to the different Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst thoſe of the Reformation, it cannot be more objected againſt us by our Adverſaries, than it is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented amongst our ſelves: but we cannot but wonder to hear them make that an Objection againſt us, of which it is ſo manifeſt, themſelves have been ſo great a Cauſe.</p>
            <p>We are much obliged to them, for their being ſo ſollicitous to render us
<pb facs="tcp:34208:3"/>
leſs liable to Miſtakes, than accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our own Principles it ſeems we are, and are very ready to embrace any Directions which may be helpful to us in our Inquiries after Truth; but we think they take a moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous way to bring us to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg thereof, who, becauſe we and others may be deceived, go about to perſwade us, that we ſhall always ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be ſo, unleſs we ſubmit to the Direction of ſuch Guides, which without giving us any aſſurance of what they pretend, that they neither will nor can deceive us, they are pleaſed to recommend unto us.</p>
            <p>As if becauſe among thoſe who walk through <hi>London</hi>-Streets in the day-time, ſome happen to ſtumble, others to fall into the dirt, others to
<pb facs="tcp:34208:4"/>
loſe their way, that therefore it is the moſt prudent courſe which any Man can take, to come out in the Night, and according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of thoſe who confidently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him, that they will bring him ſafe to his Journeys end, having put his Neck into an Halier, to ſuffer himſelf to be drag'd through thick and thin, until he is almoſt choaked, and inſtead of being brought to the place whither he deſigned to go, finds himſelf at laſt thrown into a Ditch with his Pockets pick'd.</p>
            <p>None can be more ready than we ſhould be to ſubmit to the Guidance of an infallible Directer did we know where to find him; but of this we deſpair, eſpecially ſince one of the beſt Arguments to perſwade us to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb facs="tcp:34208:4"/>
after him, is nothing elſe but an Objection againſt Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a Reflection upon God Almighty for having made us ſuch Creatures as we find our ſelves to be.</p>
            <p>Becauſe ſome in the uſe of their Reaſon are, and may be deceived, that therefore all muſt, is a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which any one might be apt to think would ſeem ridiculous to all Mankind.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is eaſie to gueſs of what Spirit and Temper they are, who, by ſuch weak Motives, are tempted to leave our Communion.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially ſince we cannot but take notice, that even amongst thoſe whoſe Converſations, to our great grief, have not diſcovered that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
<pb facs="tcp:34208:5"/>
Senſe of Religion, which might be expected from Men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing the pure and ſincere Doctrine of Chriſtianity, there are but very few, who by much more powerful Arguments have been prevailed with to forſake it.</p>
            <p>Who the Author of <hi>Pax Vobis</hi> is, we are not inquiſitive to know, but ſome are inclinable to believe him a Convert, both from his being ſo well acquainted with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from the profane uſe which he now thinks fit to make of it.</p>
            <p>To apply theſe <hi>[Stand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free,</hi> Gal. <hi>5.1. — Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>3.17. In my Father's Houſe are many
<pb facs="tcp:34208:5"/>
Manſions;</hi> Joh. <hi>14.2.]</hi> and ſuch like places after ſuch a manner, as to make them import a Liberty given by Chriſt, to believe and act as we pleaſe, is an excellent way to ridicule the Bible. And the Church of <hi>R.</hi> does very well to forbid the free uſe thereof, if they of her Communion are ſo apt to abuſe it as this Author has done.</p>
            <p>The Controverſie between us and our Adverſaries, has been hitherto managed with as little Reflection as the Cauſe would bear; but if in theſe Dialogues we do not behave our ſelves ſo very gravely towards them as we have done formerly, they who gave the occaſion are to be blamed for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34208:6"/>For they have no juſt Reaſon to be angry with us if (as long as we keep within the bounds of Decency, Truth, and Loyalty) we are by them provoked to expreſs our ſelves after a different manner than we had otherwiſe intended.</p>

               <p>What you call an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Foundation, has been ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhown to be but a ſandy one. But what you mean by the uncertain Reaſonings of every particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and by giving leave to believe

               <p>My meaning in ſhort is this. That the Rule of Faith of the Reformation being Scripture, as each Perſon of ſound Judgment in the Church underſtands it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any particular Perſon judgeth to be the meaning of Scripture, will be to him his Rule of Faith; and therefore ſince different Perſons do put different Interpretations upon the Scripture; nay, ſince the ſame Perſons do interpret it at one time one way, and at another time ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the Principle, upon which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is built, is very uncertain. For one Man may be of one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, another of another, a third of one different from both.

think fit to profeſs an alteration of his Judgment without any juſt Reaſon, or without having made any inquiry, whether he may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it or no; and if he does ſo, the alteration of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſo far from being a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he ſhould change his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that it is in it ſelf a great fault.</p>

               <p>The Reformation is a word which denotes all thoſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches or Perſons, which have left the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that ſome of thoſe which have left that Communion, may ſeparate from it by degrees, others all at once; that ſome of them may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome of that Church's Errors, and others may maintain Errors as bad as any which ſhe holds. But does it therefore follow, becauſe all theſe are ſtiled Members of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the account of their not living in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they are all in the right, and that a man may lawfully hold whatever is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any of them?</p>

               <p>They all pretend to ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of judgment; and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rule of Faith is, Scripture as interpreted by men of ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>The Rule is good, but their pretences are not.

               <p>In his Fourth he relates other wicked Tenets of the Reformation, eſpecially ſuch as encourage looſeneſs of manners.</p>
               <p>In his fifth, Such as have reſpect to Chriſts having eſtabliſh'd a Church; to the truth of what he and the Apoſtles taught; to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement about the Canon of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34208:21"/>
Scripture; to the changing of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; to the Doctrines of Juſtifying Faith, of Works, of Gods Grace, of the keeping his Commandments; all which wicked Tenets he makes it appear, that ſeveral of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers have held, and therefore that they are the Doctrines of the Reformation, and may lawfully be held by any Member thereof, if he will adhere to his own Principles.</p>

               <p>In the beginning of the ſixth he inveighs againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for pretending to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon her Members, her Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of Scripture, which is no more than what is done by the Papiſts, and is directly contrary to the Doctrine of the Reformation. In the latter end thereof, and in the beginning of the ſeventh, he ſhews, that according to the Principles of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34208:22"/>
the Reformation, a man may believe all the Doctrines of the Popery; that ſeveral of the Reformers have believed ſeveral of them; and that the only difference betwixt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and the Reformers in this caſe, is, That the former believe their Doctrines to be true, upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church; the latter, becauſe they judg them to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Scriptures.</p>
               <p>He avers in his Concluſion, That according to the Principles of the Reformation, no Doctrine or Tenet whatſoever can be wicked or blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, but that all are ſacred and ſolid Judgments; and reflects very ſharply upon Dr. <hi>Stil.</hi> for making <hi>Jupiter</hi> to be the Supreme God.</p>

               <p>He is very witty upon the Doctor, and would fain perſwade him to turn Pagan; and I believe if the Doctor would be ruled by him, he could teach him how to do it, without ever turning from being a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:34208:22"/>But ſince you have given a brief account of this Book, pray let us reckon what the whole thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to.</p>
               <p>As far as I can perceive, the ſum of all is no more than this, That ſeveral of the Reformers have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from one thing to another, and that ſome of them have held moſt groſs and ſcandalous Tenets; and therefore ſince every man is bound to follow his own Judgment, he may according to the Principles of the Reformation lawfully embrace any Opinion or Doctrine whatſoever.</p>

<q rend="margQuotes">Each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation conſtrains as much as it can, all people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve its own Tenets; Proteſtancy would have us all be Proteſtants, and would root <hi>Lutherans</hi> out of the World, as well as Popery; <hi>Lutherans</hi> would, if they could, draw all to their own net; <hi>Presbytery</hi> eſteems it ſelf to be the beſt of all, and would cruſh Proteſtancy if it

               <p>Great alterations cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in a moment; and it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome time to bring men out of that darkneſs in which they had ſo long ſat; and if we were to be brought back again to that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which we then were, thirty or forty years might well be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to effect it in; for how haſty ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome folk may be, it is not ſo eaſie a work to convert millions on the ſudden: And beſides, when men are blind, they are much more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have their ſight reſtored, than when they ſee very well, to ſuffer their eyes to be put out.</p>

               <p>That is one of the moſt ſilly things which your Author in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts upon, <hi>p.</hi> 39. for Truth, after it has been obſcured for a great while in any Nation, cannot be made immediately to recover its wonted brightneſs; and when great oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is made againſt it, it is very well, if at firſt it gets any ground at all.</p>
               <p>And therefore although a certain Gentleman has taken a great deal of pains to ſhow how indecent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper it is to call King <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. the Poſtilion of the Reformation; yet does that expreſſion very well declare his Courage and Reſolution in firſt undertaking ſo hazardous an Enterprize, as well as the Effects thereof; his daſhing all that were near and about him, as well as his receiving ſome dirt himſelf.</p>

us that ſo much was done; and I had much rather have lived in the lattter end of his Reign, than in the days of our King <hi>John,</hi> when his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs was pleaſed to ſhut up our Church-doors, and would not be prevailed with to open them until the King upon his knees had reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Crown unto his Legat <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulphus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Reign of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. the Reformation came to no true Settlement until the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſince which time the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations have been very inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; neither do I ſee what occaſion we have for any more.

               <p>If their compliance was after the manner of honeſt Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth,</hi> who when he was in the right way ſuſpected he was in the wrong, and thereupon went out of it; but upon the diſcovery of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, returned immediately into it again, they were to be commended for it. But if they turned out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, what do you tell me of them? If they were Knaves and Hypocrites, I do not intend to increaſe their number.</p>

               <p>Is it not a ſcandal upon the Reformation, that ſuch men ſhould be of it, who give themſelves the liberty of doing whatever ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beſt in their own eyes?</p>

               <p>The Reformation, as I once before told you, is a word, and ſignifies no more than the forſaking the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; and what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is it againſt any mans leaving the Communion of that Church, That amongſt thoſe who have left it,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34208:29"/>
there are as bad, if not worſe, than thoſe who continue in it.</p>
               <p>What if amongſt the Reformers, there be found a Vicar of <hi>Bray,</hi> or an <hi>A. P.</hi> in an Univerſity, muſt it needs follow that you and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will do as they did, if there were occaſion? Think of that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, becauſe ſome men are always turning when 'tis convenient ſo to do; will you allow their Carriage to be an objection againſt all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts?</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Well Sir, it is a very wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thing, that they who ſtile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Reformers, ſhould be guilty of ſuch practiſes, and hold ſuch Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Tenets as this Book aſſures you they have done.</p>

               <p>Doſt thou think that I value any man barely becauſe he is a Reformer, if his Faith be Erroneous, or his Life ſcandalous? For inſtance, if you could make me believe that one of the Reformation drinks, till
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34208:29"/>
he drinks Healths to the P—though perhaps when time was he would have drunk it t'other way; that a ſecond Reformer is ſo indifferent in his Religion, that he cares not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his own Church to be a true Church. And that a third out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwears the boldeſt Collonel in the King of <hi>Polands</hi> Army, and drinks confuſion to all Religions, till at laſt he drinks an Health to the D— I think you cannot deſire more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Suppoſitions againſt our ſelves, than theſe are. Nay, I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but you may find ſome mere Time-ſervers, ſome Drunkards, and common Swearers, and very ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous debauched perſons, not only in the Reformation at large, but even in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Pray Sir, mark what I ſay, and make your beſt on't; our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is <hi>pure,</hi> and ſo is our Form of Worſhip; but alas! the actions and lives of many of us are not ſo. But
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34208:30"/>
muſt not I therefore reſpect thoſe worthy Gentlemen whoſe lives are unblamable, and who by their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and prudent demeanor have given ſuch reputation to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Profeſſion, and to that Excellent Church of which they are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Why, Sir, you are very free indeed with your own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, ſome of which you care not, if they be thought as bad as any of thoſe Doctors which the Author of <hi>Pax Vobis</hi> makes mention of.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>What if they be? Is it a ſin to leave the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe there are ſuch as theſe out of it?</p>
               <p>As there are a great many bad men amongſt thoſe of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (and if there be any who hold it lawful for every man to believe and practiſe what he pleaſes, I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon thoſe to be the worſt of all) ſo
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34208:30"/>
there are a great many good men too. As there is error amongſt ſome of them, ſo is there truth amongſt others; and if any part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ever had the latter, I am ſure the preſent Church of <hi>England</hi> has. And therefore although I do very much ſuſpect that the Author of <hi>Pax Vobis</hi> has not done fairly by the Reformers, yet granting all that he has ſaid to be true, I am firmly reſolved (and I have great reaſon to be ſo) notwithſtanding all the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and perhaps Blaſphemous Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others; Notwithſtanding the various changes and alterations which have been made by our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, To continue firm to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtabliſhment, and ſo I believe will all the conſidering people that are in the whole Nation.</p>
               <p>Come, Sir, we will talk no more about theſe matters.</p>
               <p>Only let me add one thing before we go: That you of the Church of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34208:31"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> have at this time the leaſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to find fault with the Hereſies, Schiſms, and extravagant Tenets of ſome of the Reformation, ſince it is ſo viſible that they are like to do you better ſervice than your beſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
