            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

P<hi>'s,</hi> Houſes to give them notice to be at the Meeting, but they being ſo far from home that they could not have timely notice, it was reckon'd great Injuſtice for them to proceed and try Friends and <hi>T. Hicks</hi> in their abſence; and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101151:2"/>
upon Complaint they gave another Meeting: But <hi>T. Lloyd S. Jenings,</hi> and the reſt are ſo far ſhort of the Juſtice of the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> that they never ſo much as acquainted G.

Then much more you: for they gave ſome Notice before of their intending to Try <hi>Tho. Hicks,</hi> but you never ſo much as told G. K. of your ſo Meeting: Wherefore allow us ſo much Juſtice as the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> did to have another Meeting publickly to try G. K. where all People may be preſent, that are willing to come, and whereof G. K. may have timely notice, and liberty to plead his own Cauſe, and let all Impartial People judge; &amp; through Gods Aſſiſtance we ſhall make it appear, that your ſaid Judgment is unjuſt, &amp; G. K. not worthy of Condemnation. Was there ever ſuch an Act done in any Chriſtian Society before, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn a man without ever hearing of him, or ſuffering him to ſpeak for himſelf? Surely its far ſhort of any worldly Court, where the party ſhall have timely notice to prepare for his his Tryal, and liberty to plead his own cauſe in the face of the Country, and where his Accuſers are not allowed to ſit and give Judgment againſt him: But ſo it is, that thoſe Unjuſt &amp; Unrighteous Judges have proceeded to try, judge, and publiſh their Judgment againſt G. K. without ever hearing of him,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101151:3"/>
when its well known the moſt of them were his great Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers: They might be ſure this way to condemn him, when only a Faction of them get together, and accuſe him, and he nor any for him be preſent to ſpeak for him. But that which ſtill hightens the Crime of <hi>Tho. Lloyd, Sam Jenings,</hi> and the reſt of the 28 Unjuſt Judges, is, that they of the Miniſtry ſhould give ſuch a falſe Judgment, and then impoſe it on all the Meetings in theſe 3 Provinces, when moſt of the Friends thereof are great ſtrangers to the Matter in Controverſie, not knowing which Party is in the Right, but they muſt take ſaid Judgment upon Truſt from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without enquiring into the Cauſe and Verity thereof; and where they think their ſaid Judgment will not readily be ſwallowed down, they will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it from Meeting to Meeting, cloathed with their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratical Robes, and if any Friends ſhow their diſlike of having it impoſed on them without their own conſent, and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter, preſently threaten to bind them to the good Behaviour, and to the Peace, and call out for a Conſtable, thereby endeavouring to trample us down by their Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Power &amp; Authority, as <hi>Samuell Jenings, Sam. Richardſon, Thomas Lloyd, John Delavall</hi> and <hi>Anthony Morris</hi> did lately at a Monthly Meeting near <hi>Frankford,</hi> as is well known to many. Oh! whither do you think theſe things will run? will it not give People juſt cauſe to ſay, the <hi>Quakers</hi> are turned Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors? But our Truſt and Confidence is in the Lord alone, who hitherto has pleaded the Cauſe of the Innocent, and carried his People through all the Powers &amp; Oppoſitions that have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to riſen up againſt them in all Ages, and we doubt not but he will do the lar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But are theſe your Proceedings <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or <hi>Proteſtant</hi>-like? or do they not rather reliſh of Rank <hi>Popery,</hi> for the Clergy or them of the Miniſtry to impoſe their Edicts on the People, without their enquiring into the matter? is not th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

Is not this believing as the Church believes, in order to bring in <hi>Ignorance the Mother of Devotian?</hi> Oh! who but ignorant and blind men, but can ſee theſe things! And yet now will ye ſtand in them, O ye <hi>

Will you come ſhort of the Juſtice of the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> who admitted of another Meeting for a Hearing?

You hate the Light becauſe your deeds are Evil, &amp;c.</hi> Say not, that we are bold and daring thus to Challenge you; for its not writ in a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Spirit as relying on our own Strength or Parts, but on the Lord alone, on whom is our Dependance, and who knows the Innocency of our Cauſe, and therefore we are not afraid to bring it to the Teſt, but willing to appear openly, as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we have done in Print, and not as your Practice is to report falſe things ſecretly abroad, which we know not whom to faſten upon; but what we publiſh in Print remains to be the Authors, whether true or falſe; if falſe, why don't you refute it, the Preſs is free and open for you, as for any?

But if Diſcount be allowable in this caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why are not G. K's hard words diſcounted againſt thoſe that have been given to him, ſo far as they will reach?

            <p>Now let the Impartial Reader judge, which have exceeded in hard Words? and whether they are not very partial to paſs by all that hath been ſaid againſt G.

K. was the Complainer for many Months, for Juſtice to be done to Truth, they could plead for Diſcount, and put Blaſphemy againſt Chriſt Jeſus, in the Ballance againſt Reflections upon themſelves, and yet now will not diſount for hard words. And a ſo they have judged a whole Meeting without ever admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of them. If this be not Partiality, Injuſtice and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Judgment, tell us what is. And clear your ſelves of theſe things, if you can.</p>
