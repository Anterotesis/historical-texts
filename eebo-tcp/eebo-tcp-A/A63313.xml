            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">With Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi>'s Speech at the place of Execution.</head>
            <p>ABout 11 this Morning, the three Priſoners were put together in a Sledge, and being come to the place of Execution, went out of the Sledge into the Cart; Major <hi>Lowick</hi> firſt, who turning round to all the Spectators, who were numerous, deſired them all to pray for him. Then he and Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> kneeled down together on one ſide of the Cart, and <hi>Cranburne</hi> on the other, and prayed about a quarter of an hour, or more; <hi>Cranburne</hi> had firſt done, and the Executioner coming to fix the Halter, in opening his Boſom, took out a Paper, which the Executioner delivered to the Sheriff; but <hi>Cranburn</hi> coming forward, deſir'd it again, and having receiv'd it, he ſpoke to this effect, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reading.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>I am come here to Dye, and ſhall ſhortly appear before the Dreadful Tribunal of God the Searcher of all Hearts. I confeſs my ſelf a great Sinner, and that I have miſpent my Youth, but hope for Mercy in and through the Blood of my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Gentlemen, <q>
                  <hi>I adviſe you all to take warning by me, and do not mispend your time, but learn to be truly Religious, for he that is truly Religious, will be Loyal to his lawful King,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. or words to that effect. Then he ſaid, that for his Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his Lawful King he came there to Die, and acknowledged the late King <hi>James</hi> to be his Rightful King, and hoped he would be reſtored to his Throne in Gods due time. <q>
                  <hi>As to the Aſſaſſination,</hi>
               </q> ſaid he, <q>
                  <hi>of the Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>I confeſs I came to the Knowledge thereof from</hi> Mr. Chernock <hi>between</hi> 10 <hi>and</hi> 11 <hi>a Clock on the 22th of</hi> February;</q> here the Sherriff ſpoke to him, and ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe paſſed, which was not ſo loud as before; Then he went on again, and ſaid as before, <hi>that he came to the Knowledge thereof between</hi> 10 <hi>and</hi> 11 <hi>the 22th. of</hi> February, <hi>and that between</hi> 11 <hi>and</hi> 12 <hi>the whole Deſign was over,</hi> or words to that effect, and this he repeated ſeveral times, as if he would have created a Belief thereof in the Auditory: As for his Religion, he ſaid he was Baptiſed and Educated, and now Dyed an unworthy Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that what he had Learned from that Church, was truly to ſerve God, and to be Loyal to his King: Mr. <hi>Sheriff</hi> asked whether that Religion had taught him to Murder Kings, or to that effect; which he did not poſitively anſwer, but ſeemed to evade. And ſoon after Kneeling down he pray'd for King <hi>James,</hi> Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> his Conſort, <hi>Katharine</hi> the Queen Dowager, his Royal Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> (<hi>to give you his own words</hi>) and then re-delivered his Paper to Mr. <hi>Sheriff.</hi> He ſeemed very compoſed and little concerned, Prayed ſeveral times, and kept his Countenance to the laſt; he wiſhed their Blood might be the laſt that ſhould be ſhed, and that the Nation might never come under a Foreign Power. He ſaid an Aſperſion had been caſt upon him, as if he had behaved himſelf Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently on ſome occaſion, which he diſowned, and appealed to ſome perſons, whom he ſaid very well knew the contrary.</p>
            <p>The two others were all this time on their Knees, and then riſing up Major <hi>Lowick,</hi> who appeared very compoſed and penitent, addreſs'd him to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, and delivered them a Paper. He proteſted he dyed in Charity with all the World, and begg'd, that all who ſhould happen to ſuffer any thing on his account, would forgive him; he ſaid, he had liv'd, and now dyed a <hi>Roman Catholick;</hi> he had a little Book in his hand, out of which he prayed, and often kiſs't a Crucifix in it, and gave it to Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> who did the like: He gave the Book away to one of the Spectators, and ſometime after called for it again; and he and <hi>Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> having kiſs't the Crucifix, he reſtor'd it again.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> ſemed the moſt dejected, ſcarce ſaid any thing, but prayed hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, he delivered a Paper to the Sheriff and wept much. Major <hi>Lowick</hi> alſo Wept. After they were Tyed up and had prayed ſome time, the Executioner asked them for a <hi>Sign,</hi> Mr <hi>Cranburn</hi> deſired Major <hi>Lowick</hi> to give a Sign, which he declining, Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> ſaid <q>we will give no <hi>Sign, Draw away when you pleaſe.</hi>
               </q> They all gave Money to the Executioner.</p>
