            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Copie of this enſuing <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> (for ſo I
title it, as deeming it no other) lately delivered
in to the Aſſembly by the <hi>Diſſenting Brethren,</hi>
falling under my view (by a divine providence)
I endeavoured a tranſcript thereof, ayming at no
other end but the reſerving it by me for my private and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſatisfaction. Since which time upon occaſionall converſes with
divers of the Presbyterian party, I have been an often eare-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of many untrue and unjuſt aſperſions which reflected upon
the Reverend Authors, as if the <hi>Independants</hi> (ſo they are
pleaſed to call them) could not, or durſt not (according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Aſſembly) produce a <hi>Model</hi> and bring in thither,
ſuch a Frame of Church-government with the Reaſons and
grounds thereof as they contend for; or rather, that they had in
their conceptions ſome <hi>Chima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ra,</hi> or ſome <hi>Utopian</hi> Frame,
which in the iſſue would prove either abortive or ridiculous; and
that therefore being privy to the weaknes of their own principles,
they have reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ted onely, inſtead of a <hi>perfect Body,</hi> an airy, and
(to uſe ſome of their own words) a rayling accuſation againſt the
Reverend Aſſembly, intending nothing leſſe then the product of
a <hi>Compleated Frame,</hi> and nothing more than the cheating of
the people, whom they know do expect ſuch an <hi>accompliſht plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</hi>
Theſe and the like undue beſpatterings, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſht from the
mouthes of ſome whom I dare not but call Brethren, and that upon
thoſe who for their perſonall endowments they themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to be both pious and learned; and frequently hinted into the
minds and thoughts of the godly and well-affected of either part
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65766:2"/>
(who at preſent by reaſon thereof are at a loſſe both in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and expectations) coming within my hearing and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
I found (weighing the rationall conſiderations exhibited
in this <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> for their refuſall to deliver in to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
their <hi>Model</hi> of Church-government, as was impoſed on
them) an irreſiſtable dictate from my conſcience, to convert the
Manuſcript into a printed Copie. Wherein the ingenious Reader
may clearly perceive, and truly judge what was the direct <hi>Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
that deterred them (contrary to their primary reſolves) from
doing that which was required by the Aſſembly, and what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
are their reall intentions for the future, namely, to let the
Churches have the benefit of what they have prepared to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
which I am confident in as convenient a time as is ſutable
to ſuch a work, they will perfect and exhibit to open view. As for
the godly and learned Authors themſelves, I humbly crave their
pardon that I have preſumed without their knowledge to preſent
this their Copie to the world, profeſſing that no ſiniſter ends at all
byaſſed me: 'Twas onely the ſatisfying of my own Conſcience, and
my earneſt deſires that the truth and candour of their cauſe, and
their proceedings therein, may (notwithſtanding the beſmearings
that others endeavour to caſt on both) be rightly reſented by the
godly and judicious, that hath ſwayed my reſolutions: which ends
if I attain, I have enough.</p>

            <head>
               <date>December 12. 1644.</date> We gave in Reaſons of our
diſſenting, to this Aſſembly, againſt the ſubordination of Synods, and
they were committed to be anſwered and brought in.</head>
            <head type="sub">
               <date>April 4. 1645.</date> An Order was made by this Aſſembly, that the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of this Aſſembly, who have formerly entred their diſſents to the
Presbyteriall Government, ſhall be a Committee to bring in the whole
Frame of their Judgements, concerning Church Government, in a body
with their grounds and Reaſons.</head>
            <head type="sub">It was alſo by this Aſſembly, lately impoſed on us, to make report
of what we had done in the Committee.</head>
            <p>HOw willing and ready we have been from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Diſcuſſions in this Reverend Aſſembly, to
make known whatever we hold, concerning <hi>Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
as we have had publique teſtimony in this
Aſſembly, ſo we have manifold inſtances and evidences of it; Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that conſtant, free, and open expreſſing our ſelves upon all
occaſions, and in all queſtions propounded to the debate, with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to give an open Account at any time, in what ever ſhould be
asked us by any Brother. Our profferring divers times to bring in
Propoſitions, ſtated to our ſenſe for the diſpute, and when we were
made a Committee to that purpoſe, in the point of <hi>Ordination,</hi> and
did bring our Judgements concerning it for a diſpute, It was laid
aſide. And at another time, when we ourſelves brought in papers,
giving the ſtate of the queſtion, about that <hi>extraordinary way of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi>
which were read, and returned back unto us, it being
publiquely profeſſed that <hi>that was not an allowed way and courſe of this
Aſſembly, for any of the Brethren to bring in papers, unleſſe they were made
a Committee by the Aſſembly it ſelf.</hi> And ſo we were prevented of doing
the like for time to come.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe our frequent complainings of the ſtating of queſtions,
ſo that we could not fully argue for our Judgements, we being
bound up to the queſtions as ſtated by you. The uſuall anſwer to
our Complaints heerin being, <hi>That the Aſſembly ſate not to argue the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65766:3"/>
opinions of a few men, but that if we had any thing to ſay to the aſſertion
brought in, we might.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As alſo our earneſt contending to have ſome queſtions (<hi>which
you all know are the greateſt and moſt fundamentall points</hi>) fairly diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and debated, is a ſufficient teſtimony of this our willingneſſe.
As in the entrance into the diſpute of <hi>Government,</hi> the firſt day, we
preſſed the handling of this, <hi>That there is a platform of Government for
the Churches, under the Goſpel, laid down in the Scripture,</hi> and deſired to
have diſcuſſed, <hi>what are the ſure and certain wayes, whereby we may
judge what of Government, is held forth</hi> Jure divino <hi>therein,</hi> which
ſhould have been fundamentall to all the diſputes that were to
follow: and this was profeſſedly laid aſide by you, which therfore
in none of the ſubſequent debates, we could renew, and thus Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
were cut off, It being that great and neceſſary <hi>Medium,</hi>
by which the particulars ſhould be confirmed, and in a manner,
the whole controverſie decided; the greateſt difference that were
likely to grow betwixt us, being this, <hi>That the forms of Government,
you pretend to, and we deny, are aſſerted to be</hi> Jure divino.</p>
            <p>In like manner that other next great queſtion, about <hi>the intire
power in Congregations, that have a ſufficient Presbytery for all Cenſures,</hi>
which as it is in order the firſt that preſents it ſelf for diſcuſſion (as
was urged) ſo alſo it is one of the greateſt points in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us and you: Yet the debate of this was not onely denied the
firſt place in the diſpute, but was to this day declined by you; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
to have it argued was contended for by us, and not by us
onely, but by many of thoſe, that are for a ſubordinate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof to Synods. And though earneſt deſires and motions
for it were renewed and inculcated, yet were they as often laid
aſide. Yea and this, although it was once expreſly commended
by the grand Committee of the Honorable Members of both
Houſes, joyned with twelve Divines of the Aſſembly, to be next
diſputed, as the beſt means, both of expedition, and of ending the
Controverſie.</p>
            <p>And over and above all this, to argue this our willingneſſe to
diſpute our way, In the aforeſaid Honorable Committee appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by an Order of the Honorable Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> to find out
wayes, of accommodating different Judgements in the Aſſembly,
the Sub-Committee of Divines, conſiſting of two of us, and foure
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65766:4"/>
others, appointed by that Honorable Committee to prepare waies
and Propoſitions of Accommodation, brought in the main and
moſt of what practically we deſired, and we therein added, <hi>That
if ſuch a libertie ſhall ſeem in the wiſdome of this Honorable Committee, to
be ſo prejudiciall to the peace of the Church as not to be permitted, we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
deſire, the doctrinall principles wherein we differ about Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
may be taken into ſerious conſideration, and ſome other way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
in practiſe thought upon, as ſhall ſeem fit to this Honorable
Committee:</hi> and this was preſented to that Honorable Committee
and thoſe twelve of the Aſſembly, to be tranſmitted, whether to
the Honorable Houſes, or the Aſſembly as they ſhould think meet.</p>
            <p>After this, when upon occaſion of ſomething brought in by one
Brother, and intertained, we took hold of that example, and one
of us, with conſent of the reſt, brought in ſeven Propoſitions, which
contained matter of difference betwixt us, profeſſing, <hi>That if this
Reverend Aſſembly would debate them, or any one of them, we would bring
in more, untill we had brought in all the Frame, and the Aſſembly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſhould pick and chuſe what they would debate, and what not.</hi> But
theſe Propoſitions were rejected with a refuſall to debate any one
of them.</p>
            <p>And after all this, though the main parts of the Presbyteriall
government, had been then voted by the Aſſembly, and ſent up
to the Honorable Houſes (as, namely, that about <hi>Ordination,</hi> and
<hi>the Presbyteriall government over many Congregations,</hi> as alſo concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>the Subordination of Nationall, Provinciall and Claſſicall Aſſemblies</hi>)
and there was not much remaining about Church-government,
to be concluded in this Aſſembly: yet this Reverend Aſſembly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring,
(by occaſion of a book publiſhed, that reflected on theſe
proceedings, that we had no hand in, nor knowledge of) <hi>a whole
Frame of Government, with the grounds and reaſons thereof, to be brought
in by us,</hi> and voted us heerto to be a Committee, we yeilded our
ſelves to be a Committee, to bring in part by part, in like manner
as the Presbyteriall Government was brought into the Aſſembly,
and diſputed: but that was not accepted. And then it being ſaid,
that there was ſomething in Church-government, remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcuſſed,
and unreſolved; and it being further alledged that the
Aſſembly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad not ſent up all that which they had concluded, but
meant to preſent an entire Frame and Body to the Honorable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65766:4"/>
Houſes: And that we might take away all occaſions of any ſuch
jealouſies that we were unwilling to diſcover what we held
(which were commonly in mens mouthes abroad) we yeilded to
be a Committee, to bring in the whole to this Aſſembly, though
upon all the fore-mentioned diſadvantages, and were purpoſed
and reſolved amongſt our ſelves ſo to do, and that in as conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
a time as a work of ſuch a compaſſe could, (in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as was propoſed by you) be diſpatched by us. And as in the
debate about making us a Committee, the Aſſembly would not
declare (though preſſed by us) what they would do with that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell,
and thoſe Reaſons we ſhould bring in; ſo the voting of what
yet remained in <hi>Church-government,</hi> was haſtened by you.</p>
            <p>And when not long after, upon occaſion of the debate of one
particular point, in which we differed from this Aſſembly, we
moved it might be deferred, becauſe we ſhould preſent our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Reaſons about it, with the reſt, (for therein lay that
which we accounted the favour of being made a Committee by
you) it was publiquely anſwered, <hi>that therefore the Aſſembly ſhould
the rather go on to the concluding of it, becauſe we intended to bring it in;</hi>
and before we could diſpatch that <hi>Body</hi> we intended, ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it unto you according to your order; (the collection of the
materials whereof, ſpent us two or three moneths, and we could
not obtain the liberty to bring in any thing but the whole) this
Aſſembly had preſented to the Honorable Houſes, as well what
had been ſent up by peeces afore, as what was ſince concluded, in
one intire Frame. By all which we perceived, that that which was
the main end and uſe of preſenting ſuch a Modell to this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
would be fruſtrated.</p>
            <p>And furthermore, we having given in (as this Aſſembly knows)
but <hi>two heads of diſſenting reaſons:</hi> The one againſt <hi>the Presbyterial go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
over many Congregations:</hi> The other againſt <hi>the ſubordination
of Synods.</hi> By the ſucceſſe of the latter we ſee, that this Aſſembly
can aſſume the liberty (if it ſo pleaſe) to reſerve thoſe we ſhall now
preſent, unanſwered, as they have done thoſe our diſſenting Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
againſt ſubordination of Synods, <hi>although it contain a great and
main part of that wherein we differ, as alſo is of all other, of the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
both to this Church and State,</hi> and hath been given in to this
Aſſembly ten moneths ſince, and their votes concerning theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65766:5"/>
Subordinations, as long ſince preſented to the Honorable Houſes,
but have not been anſwered by any reply brought in to this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
and ſo not ready to have been ſent up to the Honorable
Houſes.</p>
            <p>And if Theſe we might now bring in, ſhould be undertaken to
be anſwered by this Aſſembly, yet we ſtill retain the ſenſe of ſo
much remedileſſe prejudice, <hi>by being bound from replying again,</hi> as
doth make us juſtly wary: we may for ever lie under whatever miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretations
may happen, (ſuppoſe but through miſtake of
yours, or imperfection of our expreſſion) without clearing our
meaning, and we may be bound up from further urging or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
home that wherein the ſtrength of any Argument lies, if the
dint thereof ſhould be avoided by ſome ſpecious diverſion. And
although our former Reaſons given in after diſpute to both the
Honorable Houſes, according to their Order, were therefore not
our own, but to be diſpoſed of according to their appointment;
yet what we ſhould now give in, we conceive to be in our own
power.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe conſiderations we think that this Aſſembly hath no
cauſe now to require a <hi>Report</hi> of us, nor will that our <hi>Report</hi> be of
any uſe, ſeeing that <hi>Reports</hi> are for <hi>Debates,</hi> and <hi>Debates</hi> are for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults</hi>
to be ſent up to the Honorable Houſes, <hi>who have already voted
another form of Government then what we ſhall preſent.</hi> However it may
be of more uſe ſome other way, which by this courſe may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
And therefore we are reſolved to wait for ſome further
opportunitie, to improve what we have prepared.</p>
