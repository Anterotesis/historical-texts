         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Rebel's Plea, Examined.</head>
            <p>THe Writers of the Parliament side asserting highly, the
Liberty of the Subject, think they oppose those of
the Kings, who plead strongly for Subjection to Rulers,
which are things, no way inconsistent, for it is very evident rulers
doe not take away but preserve our Liberty. Men being of the
same nature, desire the same things; &amp; what every man desires,
none can securely enjoy; the natural inequality between men
being so little, the mutuall yeelding would in all likely-hood
be little also: The title of the strongest though the best would
be too weak to hold long, some one or more would quickly
over-match any that could pretend to that, every bodies right
was apparently no bodies, if any had the good (or ill shall I call
it) luck to have any wealth, it was according to <hi>Davids</hi> curse,
to him an occasion of falling. By the inconveniencies that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the want of Government, we finde out the nature of it:</p>
            <p>First, Our inability singly to defend our selves from our own
Country-men, and from strangers, made it necessary we should
part with all our power into anothers hands, that he might be
so able to defend us from both, seeing that from both we were
in danger to receive injury in every thing we value.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because we are capable of so much wrong, and too
apt to apprehend our selves wronged, when we are not, we must
resigne whatsoever Power of Judging or Redressing we have in
our hands into his hands, and for the Publique safety, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to submit to his, though it may seem to us an erronious
and partiall judgment; a thing though highly rationall, and
of great import to the generall, yet not to be expected from
selfish or opinionative men, unlesse the Magistrate hath a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive
Power<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, which alone, though we have no fear of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
were ground enough to put the Sword and Scepter
into the same Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93517:3"/>
Supposing therefore Power to have originally been in the
People, which shall be afterwards examined; it will not at all
upon pretence of misuser entitle them to snatch it back, any
more than I can forcibly take away, what I gave; because I can
prove it was once mine: If the people are still Judges of what is
to the publick good; and have the Power of the Sword, they
are what they were before they were no Subjects.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells us not after the rate of Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> who
thinks it possible for the <hi>tres Ordines Regni</hi> to have a Power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
Princes, but according to the worst principles of his most
<hi>Scotized</hi> followers:</p>
            <p>The People may Fight against King and Parliament both, for the
Common good, if they be both against it. <hi>Thes.</hi> 365. Of Obedience and
resistance.</p>
            <p>Kings conditions are very little bettered by those men, who
free them from the Popes <hi>Supremacy, in ordine ad bonum spirituale,</hi>
and subject them to the Peoples, <hi>in ordine ad bonum Publicum.</hi>
But it's strange, that the multitude (for what else can the People
signifie, distinct from and opposed to the King and Parliament)
that the multitude I say, should by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> be thus solemnly
invested with the highest piece of Regality, the Judging of the
publique good, whose <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ncapacity, Levity, Ignorance, Naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
Unaptnesse, for even the meanest employment of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
In his Book against <hi>Harrington,</hi> he labours to demonstrate,
see his twenty Arguments against <hi>Popular Government.</hi> King
<hi>Iames</hi> in the Conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> told us out of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
how zealously the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers defended the
Kings Power in Spirituals, while there was need of it to pull
down the Pope; but that being done, more wisely put it into
their own hands: So now it seems, it shall fare even with Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments;
While the King could not be pulled down, but by
that Assemby, their Omnipotency was every where proclaimed,
but now they must learn too, to use the Power the People gave
them for their good, or else the people may take it from them.</p>
            <p>But secondly, This Tenent is destructive of its very pretence,
as being extreamly opposite to the publique good, because to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93517:3"/>
the peace of the Nation, which is the onely time, in which we
can securely enjoy the benefit of the Governours care of the
publique Affaires by having opportunity of following our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
ones. There is much fault to be found in the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of (perhaps) every Nation in the world; private men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
by corrupt Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that the inconveniences are
so great in any one place, that it should be the concernment of
the ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ority of the Nation, to redresse them by a War, whose
effects a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e so calamitous and universall, I durst be tryed by any
besides the Needy, Ambitious and Discontented men of the
same place</p>
            <p>Man is by Nature a sociable Creature, which though Mr.
<hi>Hobs</hi> denyeth, because another had said it before him, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in this, that if a man were furnished withall the delights,
the most wanton can fancy, and freed from the feare of any
assaults; yet to be totally debarred the company of men, would
make all his pleasures irksome; nor is there any other imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
reason to be given, how men of even good parts spend a
very vast proportion of their time in hearing the flat and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
discourses of idle and weak men and women; were
there not a sociable principle in our nature, so that we can no
more put off our delighting in the company of men, then we
can our being men: We are naturally then inclined to society,
which society cannot be maintained without Government, nor
Government possibly without the power of the Sword, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
right of Judging for our selves, and maintaining that
judgement by what force we can make, being the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that attended want of Government; and therefore sure
laid down in the very Constitution: He therefore that takes up
the Sword without, nay against the Command of the Supream
Magistra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, resumes that Right which by mutuall consent all
had laid down, denies himself his Subject, stands upon terms
with him as equall, which is as much as in him lyes to dissolve
the Government, reduce all to Anarchy, and is therefore not
more in<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>rince, whose Authority he Usurps, then

            <p>
               <hi>Publique good</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> are two fine words that engage Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to their own ruine, alwayes insisted upon by those who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93517:4"/>
have not so great a share of Wealth or Power in the present
state of Affaires, as they think they deserve, or at least hope

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rses are usually such as
these; <hi>What is a Prince more than another man? inferiour in parts
and piety perhaps to thousands of his own Subjects, we are all equall,
though Statesmen make, &amp; fo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s believe a difference; Peasant is not made
of the mould of the Earth, and the Prince of the Stars in Heaven;
Though Court Flatterers calls them Gods, we see them dye like men; our

                  </gap>le.</hi> When
they have perswaded men out of the reverend esteem of the
Magistrates Person and Office, their work is half done: Then
the disputers of the Original and nature of Government suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
shew their readinesse to pull down the House, that they
may prey into the Foundation, and it is resolved, The King is
but the Commo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

wrest it out again; Laws and Magistrates were made for, and
cease to be, when they cease to be subservient to the publique
good, as the means hath a being onely in relation to the end.</p>
            <p>No wonder if the people gladly embrace such gay new no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,
pitty the simplicity of their fore-fathers, who lost their
Rights for want of knowing them, the meanest Artisans hug
their new-found Prerogative, and are resolved ere long, the
Crown and the Scepter, Laws and Magistrates shall doe their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and vaile before them. That they may value their new light
the more; it shall be shewed how high time it was to discover it,
when it was more then time they had made use of it; the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
is now in danger, if they will now endure, they then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to be ruined.</p>
            <p>There being something amisse in the administration of every
Government, Innovators can never want pretence to propose
somewhat, the redress of which would be gratefull to the people,
who have not the wit to consider the much greater inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
of a War, nor the ordinary prudence to observe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the men which would evince them to mind their own
rather then their Countries good.</p>
            <p>If some Doctors have determined it lawfull to resist in case the

mad as if a Physitian (nay madder in as much as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
is more general, because in desparate cases, he may
use desparate remedies, should therefore doe so in all cases.</p>
            <p>There is another weak part in the people, which gladly yeelds
to any assault, which seditious Oratours secure for themselves
unperceivably, that is, they naturally love to hear men spoke
ill of, but especially they are never so well pleased as when they
hear discourses of the failings of good or great men, that ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
pleasure, which their suiteablenesse to this principle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
in the Vulgar, procures them ready entertainment, and
accordingly all the faults and felicities of the Government, shall
be exaggerated to the height, improved to the very rigour of
the utmost consequence, the dissatisfied, unpreferred part of the
Clergy shall obliquely hint them (if the time for direct railing
be not come) with a superfectation of fears and jealousies, at
every Lecture; and under pretence of confessing and being
humbled for the sins of the Nation in Prayer, for the sins of us,
our Kings, and our Princes, under that head shall be instilled
into the peoples, not affections onely, but onely their very Faith,
whatsoever ill of the present Rulers, malice can conceive and
impudence utter: If any represent the necessity of those blamed
proceedings, they shall be called Time-servers, Courtiers, and
so heard if at all with prejudice: When rayling at Government
shall be called Freedome of Spirit, and despising authority,
fearing not the face of men in their Countries Cause It is a
certain signe they desire to be no longer private men, who thus
discover publique mindes.</p>
            <p>By whom and how <hi>England</hi> was seduced to undoe it self, in
order to the publique good we shall enquire hereafter; I will
now enter upon the thing it self; and enquire,</p>
            <p>1. Whether the War were not the Warr of Subjects against their
Soveraign, where we must examine whether the two Houses
were coordinate with; or subordinate to the King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:93517:5"/>
2. Whether there were any just cause for a Warr, supposing
they had a right of resisting in some cases.</p>
            <p>3 Whether or no, and how far, the alterations that since
followed may be deduced, out of the principles of the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Warr.</p>
            <p>4. Whether the principles and practise of the Presbyterian
Ministers are destructive of all Government? Before I enter
upon the first Question; I must according to Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
consider his previous argument, who in his judgment of
the late Warrs, thus argues:</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>Sect. I.</head>
               <q>The Malignant hatred of seriousness in Religion, did work so violently
in the RABBLE that I could not stay at home.</q>
               <p>This, Though frequently insisted on in his other books, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
beyond truth or modesty, and hath seduced many well-meaning
Zealots, is yet farr from conclusive; suppose some of
the meaner sort of his town, thought it enough to honour the
King, though they feared not God: must he therefore think it
enough to fear God, though he did not honour the King: that
many of the Kings party were drunken, or ungodly; is not to
the purpose, but sure it is a peice of separatisme beyond Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency
to neglect a duty, because, wicked men would joyne
in the doing, nor is this true, with which this argument is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Nor had I any place of safety from their rage, but the Armies and
garrisons of the Parliament:</q> Yes you had the garrisons of the
King, I am sure it was no part of the Kings cause, to deny his
Subjects protection for being peaceable and godly, your questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
therefore, <q>Whether those Subjects that are utterly undeservedly
deprived of the protection of Magestrates and laws, are not discharged of
their Obligations:</q> is extreamly impertinent to the thing in hand,
unlesse you had proved your demerits to be none, and you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

                  </gap>TRATES and LAWS.</p>
               <p>The first capacity of Parliaments, is to represent the people as free,
for I take it for undenyable, that the Government is constituted by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and in that contract, the People reserved themselves some rights;
Parliaments are the trustees for securing those exempted rights, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
the people as so far free: The rights and freedoms of a people, as
a People, are in order of nature before their constitution, and excepted
and so secured in it.</p>
               <p>The first of which assertions: That the Originall of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is by contract being the foundation (though if gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a weak one) ought in reason to have been backed with some
clearer evidence then, I take it for undenyable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I shall make it
out that the Originall of all Government was not so, which
though it is sufficient to overthrow that assertion, there being
not so much as an offer of any Argument peculiar to this Realm
to evince its being so; yet I shall say something to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>

there, The eldest was the Ruler, born not made their

the Power of life and death, which in all antiquity we finde the

Kings enjoy, would easily perswade us their kindred and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

a great many, they found themselves as free as they desired

is not by Contract.</p>
               <p>I shall now resolve the above cited Section into these foure
propositions:</p>
               <p>First, That the Originall of this Government was a bargain
between the King and People.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The People did reserve some Rights to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Parliament are the Trustees for securing those
exempted Rights.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, These Rights of the People, as the people were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Constitution excepted, and so secured in it.</p>
               <p>Of all which Propositions, there cannot be one true accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to all the Law and History this Age is acquainted with. In
the most tumultuous later ages past, there hath been (perhaps)
something of as good Authority to us, as our own proceedings
may be to future times.</p>
               <p>I shall oppose onely this: Because in all the Chronicles that
ever I met with, the higher I go, the more absolute I finde the
King, an ill signe of Rights exempted in the very Constitution,
and the priviledges we now enjoy (as to share in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
were wrested (and it is easie to track when) by fraud and
force from weak or indigent Kings, or given as acts of grace, and
acknowledged with thankfulnesse for such: I would desire to
be informed, when and where we did meet to chose our King?
whether before we lived without any form of Government, o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
what we had, upon what occasion we changed it? who were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the bargain between the King &amp; us? where the Copy of it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93517:6"/>
is, where is an exact Catalogue of our Liberties, for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being to secure our exempted Rights are (I should think)
to know them, Our fundamentall Laws are not (I hope) like the
Traditions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which no man knows where
to find; must we look on Parliaments as they on Councels; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what they at present Vote, though we know it then to have
beginning, to have been from the beginning. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
may perhaps startle, if out of this very Section: (as errour and
lying frequently are their own confuters) which as it is the
foundation of most Seditious Pamphlets deserves to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
considered: I can prove the War against his late Majesty to
be Rebellion.</p>
               <p>His Argument runs thus: It was not Rebellion, <q>Because the
Parliament are not his Subjects in one case,</q> i. e. <q>as they are the Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stees
for the securing those exempted Rights, and represent the people as
free, not as wholly free, but as being so far free as that exemption signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
that is, as to such Rights as were in order of Nature before the
Constitution excepted, and so established and so secured in it.</q> From
whence I thus argue.</p>
               <p>The Parliament could not represent us as free, except in
those things in which we were free <hi>i. e.</hi> in respect of those
particular priviledges which in the very constitution of the
Government were reserved; now if this Parliament did
fight for any thing, which was not so reserved, they cannot be
upon that head excused, and so it was a War of Subjects against
their Soveraign: <hi>Ergo.</hi> Now whether the <hi>Militia,</hi> taking away
the Kings Negative Vote, according to the Declaration of <hi>May</hi>
26. 1642. the 19. Propo. were any of those exempted Rights, let
any modest man judge.</p>
               <p>If the people reserved such a power to themselves in this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
Contract, it is strange it is not <hi>totidem verbis</hi> expressed? <hi>De
non apparentibus &amp; non existentibus eadem est ratio;</hi> is a rule in law
to avoid uncertainty, and dash groundlesse pretences in things
of smaller concernment. If we reserved a Power of resisting,
what hindred, but our Ancestors who were neither fools nor
Complementers, inserted not some such clause in the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Oath at least, as in the King of <hi>Poland, Quod si Sacramentum

               <p>Against this Capacity of Parliaments, of representing the
People as free, and that in the very constitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though it is enough to confute it, that it is not founded
upon any thing in our laws or Lawyers: I shall offer briefly
these two things.</p>
               <p>1. This opinion under the glorious name of Parliament, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
onely the most inconsiderable part of it, the House of

of those who began the war.</p>

they are fit for. Adde to this, Sr. <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in <hi>Pref.</hi> to 9. <hi>Rep.</hi>

His next work is to Answer two Objections. 1. <q>The Oath of
Supremacy,</q> saith he, <q>secureth the Kings Title against all Foraign Claim,
either Pope or any other.</q> The words of that Oath are plainly these.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I. A. B. <hi>Doe utterly testifie and declare in my Conscience, that the
Kings Highnesse is the</hi> Onely Supream Governour <hi>of this Realm,
and of all other his Highnesse Dominions and Countries, as well in all
Spirituall and Ecclesiasticall things (or causes) as temporall.</hi>
                  </q>
Thus far it is as clear and positive as words can make it; The Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
part of the Oath, which because it hinders not
mens designes, they are content to take notice of, followes
and that no Forraigners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the King is the onely Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Governour of this Realm, and the two Houses are equal
with him in the Government, and we may swear this, and yet
believe that, it is time to change not onely our law, but our
language; and the Houses should make us new Dictionaries
that we may know, what English words signifie.</p>
               <p>The second Argument, is one would think convincing, <q>The
two Houses acknowledge themselves His Majesties humble and loyall
Subjects assembled in Parliaments.</q> They petition the King, the
King never them, they cannot come unlesse he cals them, nor
choose to come, when he doth call them; nor stay one minuit
longer than he pleases, and yet these are his equals, not to say
his Superiours; but he that hath an equall during his own
pleasure hath none at all.</p>
               <p>He warns us to take heed of Titles, being it is likely, not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
that, King, Monarch, Emperor, Supream Lord, Majesty were
every where in the law attributed to the Kings person, but
of him in his politicall capacity, <hi>i e.</hi> the Majesty, Regality of
the two Houses: There is as little to be found of the Name as
the thing. What hath been now said, may evince that proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the Soveraign power is onely in the King to be no ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
one; but of that more hereafter: The next Objection is,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Legislation is the most principall part of the Soveraignes Right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
that belongs to the Houses, as well as the King; Be it enacted by the Kings
Majesty, Lords and Commons,</q> &amp;c. Ergo:</p>
               <p>Here Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> evidently betrays his cause; before, while it
was for his turn, the Parliament fought for, and represented us
as free in o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93517:8"/>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e it enacted by the
King, Lords and Commons,</q> termes that came up but yesterday, and
he is so conscious to himself of waving his first plea, <q>that he saies,
he will not go to records and writings;</q> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> he knows the example of
all laws, the authority of all lawyers, give judgment against
him; if a bargain was made at first, we are obliged to keep it, as
well as the King; nor can we encroach with more honesty upon
his original priviledges then he on ours. But the King it seems
shall be one of the three Estates, and the onely one, whose rights
may lawfully be invaded.</p>
               <p>Neither is it true, that the Legislative power is partly in
them, they are (I grant) to consent to the making new, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolishing
old laws; but that is no cogent proof, of the partition
of the Supream and Legislative power. It is the interest of Kings
as well as their duty, to make and repeale laws, as they suite
with, or are repugnant to, the good of their Country, which
they can no way be so well informed of, as by an Assembly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

of men, chosen out of all parts of the Realm: And where
there are considerable and distinct ranks of men, as the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
and Lay Nobility, and the Commons; it was fit they
should all be heard, and consulted with; their Interests being
divers, and sometimes thwarting, it was very like their desires
would be so too: It was this way provided, no one part should
get a grant by surprise to the disadvantage of the others, and
thus it was in <hi>England:</hi> and this the reason of demanding the
opinion of the two Houses is evident, I appeal to the Body of
the Acts themselves, &amp; here I will not insist upon the elder presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
though I might rationally enough from them, overthrow
the fancy of our Rights, secured in the constitution of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
but that being so universally granted; I shall cite
Acts of weak Kings, and later times. Onely desiring this thing
of the Reader, that he would not think those I quote to be the
onely examples to be produced; and so possibly think, either
fraud or force hath caused the people to suppresse their Rights;
let him but look upon the Statutes, he will quickly be rid of any
such fond imagination. I have therefore purposely pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the INFORMATION of his Prelates, Earls, Barons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Our Soveraign Lord the King, by the Assent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
and Established. So, <hi>Anno 12. Edw.</hi> so in all other.
Our Soveraign Lord the King by the Assent of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath
made these Acts following. In the 10. of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. where
there is expresse mention of <hi>Magna Charta, Charta de foresta,</hi>
which shews that Assembly not unmindfull of their Liberties,
or Priviledges; yet the same stile continues: It is established by
the King, by the Assent of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and at the request of the said
Knights and Commons. In the 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. The King at the
request of the Lords and Commons, <hi>&amp;c. 2. H.</hi> 5. For as much as
divers complaints have been made to our Soveraign Lord the
King, by the Commons in this present Parliament: Our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Lord the King hath ordained. This will certainly shew
the Legislative power to have been solely in the Kings Majesty
in those dayes; and therefore discovers the foolery (to say no
worse) of those who upon that head assert a partition of that
important piece of Soveraignty between him and the two
Houses.</p>
               <p>Be it enacted by the Authority of this present Parliament
or Lords and Commons, began in <hi>H.</hi> 7. time, but that that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
of phrase should make such a considerable alteration of
Government, and no notice taken either by the King that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or the people who received by it so large (as is pretended)
a share in the Government is not easily imaginable: Sure their
apprehensions were very small of it, the notice they took of it
being so little.</p>
               <p>We finde after that, not to insist upon each act or reign, which
would be tedious, and he that doubts, may consult the Books,
<hi>Anno 1. Eliz.</hi> The Lords and Commons her majesties humble
and faithfull Subjects most humbly beseeching that it may be
Enacted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the Act of Uniformity (among others) it
is. Be it Enacted by the Queens Highnesse, with the assent of the
Lords and Commons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which those words likewise inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in some places of that Act, by authority of this present Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
cannot be thought without great imputation of folly
to those members, to be repugnant; and the straining of those
words is all that he can rely on; I might here urge the old form,
<hi>Anno. 13. Eliz.</hi> Be it Enacted by the Queens most Excellent
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93517:9"/>
Majesty with the Assent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> among many others, I will onely
cite one of 4. <hi>Jac cap.</hi> 1. Be it Enacted by the Kings most Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Majesty, with the Assent of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now to speak of the
fundamentall partitian of the Soveraignty in the very consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titon
of the Government, and to make it out by a phrase newly
taken up, and to take no notice of the old forms, The King
Grants, the King Wils, the King provides, argues one very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to say some thing in a bad matter; but when this form is
it self varied, and in many Acts both are used, sure the latter
was never intended to evacuate the former, and it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely;
so great a change of the Legislative power would passe
without any notice, either of King or People; it deserved at
least one Act or Parliament to have transmitted it to posterity:
when alas we finde even in King <hi>Charls</hi> his dayes an Act framed,
according to the old regular way, in the Petition of <hi>Right;</hi> even
there when we were not sure giving away, nor unmindfull of
our liberties: To the Kings most excellent Majesty, in which
the Lords and Commons do humbly pray, that no such thing
as they <hi>Complained of, &amp;c.</hi> To which the answer was, <hi>Soi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> droit
come est desire.</hi> The Laws are alwayes called the Kings laws, but
very improperly, if this new doctrine be true. I conclude all
with the words of <hi>Bracton,</hi> an Author, the Antimonarchical
party make much use of. <q>
                     <hi>Quod Principi placuit,</hi> i. e. <hi>non quicquid est

               <p>What the reason and the effect of their assent is, is, not hard
now to judge; men have been so often taught to say, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they must assent to the making of Laws, they have a part
of the Legislative power in them, and will call it non-sense and
absurd to think otherwise: I will cite <hi>Grotius, cap. 3. de jure belli,

which was a greater priviledge then our members can plead;
yet never any was so fond as to take them lesse for Subjects,
or him for Soveraign.</p>
               <p>Princes upon the misinformation of corrupt men, may doe
much to the grievance of the Subjects, if they to avoid this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
to the people, shall provide so for their security, as
to promise not to exercise such parts, of their power without
their advice and assent, first in a Common Counsell assembled
(our old style) they shew themselves unworthy of such an Act
or grace, who will interpret it to the disadvantage, nay to the
dethroning of him that passed it. To apply it to our particular
case, suppose the King hath graciously promised not to leavy
money on his Subjects without their assent first had in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
The King now cannot do it, the King hath so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
the exercise of his power, but is by this any power pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in them? grant they had, it will not reach their purpose;
The King cannot leavy mony without their assent, but is there
any law that gives them power to leavy any without his, though
they may give mony to the King, I doubt it will puzzle a good
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93517:10"/>
Lawyer to prove, they can give the Subjects money to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
without which, I doubt, Contribution, Excise, and those
other fine words was but Theft and Robbery.</p>
               <p>That the assent of the two Houses is required to repeal a law,
will by this time, I hope, be a small argument of their partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the Soveraignty; sure I am, the Monarchs of the East
were as much limitted, the laws of the <hi>Meades</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> which
change not at the pleasure of the King the Scripture mentions;
even those Princes were sworn to observe the Laws: <hi>Ahasuerus</hi>
could not revoke the Decree against the Jews, nor <hi>Darius</hi> though
he passionately desired it of his Nobles, save <hi>Daniel, (Dan.</hi> 6.)
He that would affirm, that to be a mixt Monarchy, or that those
Nobles or any else were sharers in the Government; to say no
more, would bring a new Doctrine into the world.</p>
               <p>The next Objection is in short this, <q>
                     <hi>In a Declaration set forth in
the Kings name, It is acknowledged that the King, Lords, and Commons
make the three Estates; and the ballance must hang even between them,
&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To which I shall briefly say this, it were to the purpose, if it
could be proved that the King, Lords and Commons make the
three Estates: But the truth is, the Lords Spiritual, Temporal
and Commons are the three Estates, not to repeat many. In
the Act of Recognition of Queen <hi>Elizabeth, We your most loving,
faithfull and obedient Subjects, representing the Three Estates of this
Realme;</hi> which evidently shews the Queen was not esteemed
one. <hi>Anno 8. Eliz. cap. 1. The Clergy being one of the greatest
Estates of this Realm,</hi> it is clear therefore, that by the law, the
Clergy is one estate: So when <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. Funerals were ended, <hi>The
Three Estates did assemble and acknowledge his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on King.</hi> For their
right of being the thrid Estate unanswerably acknowledged by
Parliament; it might admit a debate, whether any two Estates
may conspire to Vote out the third; sure, if the Commons had
been so served, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have resolved it in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:
How comes it to passe, that that part of <hi>Magna Charta</hi>
which relates to the Clergy should be lesse significant then any
other. To the Kings Concession to that illegall Bill, I onely say
this, The law takes no notice of an Act, but when it is by the
assent of the Three Estates; nor could the Lay Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93517:10"/>
disoblige the King from his Oath made to the Spiritually;
there being a particular clause (besides the general, for securing
the Liberty of the Nation) In the Coronation Oath, for the
Rights and Priviledges of the Church, nothing but the Church
could give them away (if yet the Church it self could.) For it
is a thing generally granted, that a generall representative can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
cancel Obligations to particular Bodies, which truth in any
other instance people will acknowledge: The House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
are the Representative of all the Commons of this Land;
the City of <hi>London</hi> hath her Burgesses there: If they upon this
fancy of involving each ones consent, and so doing injury to
none, should Vote the City paid, the money they borrowed of
them, I believe every one would quickly discover the fallacy of
that Plea, and explode it as illegall, sinfull and rediculous;
the other case is much harder; <hi>London</hi> is the greatest City, the
Clergy is one of the greatest Estates in the Nation, according
to 8. <hi>Eliz. cap. 1. London</hi> hath some at least, that there represent
her, whereas the Clergy hath not so much as one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He saw the
impossibility of the Bishops fitting there, their Persons and
Friends assaulted, themselves like to be murthered by the
rabble (see Bishop <hi>Halls</hi> Narrative, before his last works, the
Lords making an Order to suppresse the tumults, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
not concurring but encouraging them; the Bils se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
times thrown out of the House of Peeres, and brought
in the same Session, contrary to all Order of Parliament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
which, I will say onely this: Let any man consider,
in what a condition the Kings Majesty was in then, how injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to himself, to one of the greatest Estates of this Realm, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to 8. <hi>Eliz.</hi> that grant was; how contrary to <hi>Magna (har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
to the Rights of the Church by Law, and his Majesties Oath
so much provided for; he will easily finde the Kings consent to
be extorted and null. If I should upon their Protestation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all Acts passed, during their forced absence, it would not
be easily answered.</p>
               <p>Having now shewed the Clergy to make the third Estate,
which is as much as the King hath been allowed to be of late;
the main Argument of coordination is thereby removed, I will
adde but this, The Oath of <hi>Supremacy</hi> asserts the King; to be the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93517:11"/>
sole supream Governour; and therefore sure the two Houses
are not coparceners. It is declared in <hi>Anno 16. R. 2. c.</hi> 5. The
Crown of <hi>England</hi> hath been so free at all times, that it hath
been in no earthly subjection, but immediately to God, in all
things touching the Regality of the said Crown, and to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And again, The Realm of <hi>England</hi> is an Empire governed
by, <hi>One Supream head and King,</hi> having the dignity an Royall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of the Imperiall Crown of the same 24. <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 12. unto
whom a <hi>Body Politick,</hi> compact of all sorts and degrees of people
in terms, and by names of Spiritually and Temporalty been
bounden, and ought to bear next to God a natural and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
obedience. This Body Politick consisting of all sorts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
divided into terms, and by names of Spiritualty and
Temporalty must necessarily be the Parliament, there being no
other body capable of that appellation and description, which
here acknowledgeth as such a body it self subject and him Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream.</p>
               <p>The next is a large quotation out of <hi>Grotius</hi> in Latine, that
in some cases it is lawfull to resist, but they reach not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Question; the first concerns not Supream Magistrates, but
such things as <hi>Sparta</hi> had; the second none at all: the third,
If the King aliens the Kingdome, which sure was not our case:
fourthly, If the King apparently designes the destruction of the
whole people, I will not wrong the King so much as to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to clear him from that: fifthly, If there is such a clause,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the King doth this or that, the Subjects are absolved
from their Oath, produce such a clause, and shew how the King
broke his Trust? Sixth, If there is a division of Supremacy,
and the King encroaches, he may beso far resisted. I shall make
it out, the Houses encroached upon him; as I have sufficiently
evinced the vanity of a coordination. In these cases, <hi>Grotius</hi>
thinks they who at their entring into society, contracted for
themselves and posterity, intended not to obliege them so far
as to dy, rather then resist, <hi>nisi forte cum hoc additamento si resi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and with an exception that reaches the Case.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Laws in <hi>England</hi> are above the King, because not his Acts
alone.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whose Acts the Laws are, hath been above discussed, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of this Proposition, I understand not, because he
hath not done us the favour as to let us know its meaning; if
it is not more then the words signifie, that the King ought to
rule, according to Law, and cannot abrogate Laws at pleasure:
the King asserted it in all his <hi>Declarations.</hi> In the exactest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies
I have shewed there were, laws which the Kings were
obliged by, might they therefore be resisted if they broke them?
Let us blot then all the precepts of Obedience and Submission
out of the Bible, as things sit for that pusillanimous if not craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
age: And let that patience of the Primitive Christians which
made their persecutors admire and love, be thought want of
opportunity, not desire of revenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The King was to execute judgement by his Iudges in his Court of
Iustice, and his Parliaments was his highest Court.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By the Parliament, meaning the two Houses, they are no
Court of Judicature, the House of Commons have nothing that
looks like a Court of Judicature, not the power of administring
an Oath, not the power of Imprisoning any but their own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
notwithstanding the contrary proceedings of those ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Gentlemen, of the Liberty of the Subject, the Members of
the long-Parliament, whose Committees could contrary to
law imprison men, and deny them their <hi>Habeas Corpus.</hi> The
House of Lord it is true, is a Court of Judicature, but that is as
they are the Court of the Kings Barons, whose judgment is but
ministerial and not soveraign, as appears in this, that though
they have power to reverse the Sentence of other Courts, yet
they cannot reverse their own judgment; a clear argument
their Authority is not sovera<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gn, whose judgement cannot be so

               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:93517:12"/>
For the two Houses joyned together (as the ingenious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Case of our Affaires demonstrates) they cannot so
unite or conjoyn, as to be an entire Court, either of soveraign
as ministeriall Jurisdict<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on, no otherwise cooperating then by
concurrence of Votes in their severall Houses, for preparing
matters in order to an Act; and his Argument is very good,
which when they have done, they are so far from having any
legall Authority in the State, as that in law there is no stile or
or form of their joynt acts, nor doth the law so much as take
notice of them, untill they have the Royall Assent. Should it
be granted they were, yet it is as evident there was a force upon
the House then, as there was in 1648. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o that neither the House
was full or free; first, for the Commons, a very great number
of persons fairly elected, kept out upon pretence they had some
Project, Patent, or Monoply, and kept in Sr. <hi>Henry Mildmay,</hi> Mr.

a Commission complained of, viewed and examined, the other
as much employed in matters of that nature as any man, but
they voted as that party would have them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Severall members of their party sate in the House
against the consent of the Burroughs they pretended to serve for,
when such men were concerned and complaints made, all the

and would interrupt their proceedings too much. If the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

they voted out of the House, as unduely chosen; that report
must not be made, whereby a good member may be lost, as in

               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Scots</hi> Army was not suffered to disband, that

they came from the House; they were faine to steale: away for

                  <q>The Parliament remonstrated our danger, we had reason to beleeve
them, there was a generall endeavour to change the face of things among
us, many new orders brought into the Church, abundance of painfull
(though peacable) preachers cast out; ignorant scandalous readers kept
in, the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebells declared for the King, we should have been butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <p>The Right of the people to resist their Prince, having been
examined, we now come to the reasons upon which they did it.</p>
               <p>1. Shipmoney,</p>
               <p>Not to insist upon the frequent practises of our Kings in that
nature; the consent of so many venerable judges, the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
care the King took to be informed, the employments of
it to those worthy ends, for which it was raised, were enough
with al ingenuous minds (if there were any miscarriages in the
getting) at least to excuse them.</p>
               <p>But some men with their Loyalty put of their good nature,
with their Religion loose their civility.</p>
               <p>But Mr. B. ought to have known, that the King had relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
his claim to Shipmoney before the Warr, and therefore
that could not be a cause of it. Kings may confesse and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
their faults, yet some sub<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ects will not forget them. <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
serious godlinesse, was a scorne.</hi> That was not part of the
kings cause, but it was very suspicious to see men solemnize
a few fasts, and think that entiled them to eat other mens bread
all their lives after, to scruple at being like prophane <hi>Absalon,</hi>
who wore long hare, yet immitate that good man <hi>Absalon,</hi> that
could pay his vow and Rebell devoutly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The new Orders in the Church,</hi> amount to no more then this,
Those to whom the administration of Ecclesiasticall affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to by the Laws of this land, observing some neglect order
rudeness in the performance of divine service, appointed for its
future decency, some ceremonies, neither commanded nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
in the word of God, but some of them were used in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93517:13"/>
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereupon they were esteemed (or at least wise
called) Popish. All that can possibly be said against this, is,
that it is unlawfull to use any thing in Divine Service; for
which there is neither command nor example in Scripture,
(when by the way, the latter confutes the former, supposing
there may be imitable examples in Scripture of things uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
there) which would make the black and white caps
as much Antichristian as the square one: Or, secondly, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to use it, but not if it be enjoyned; but this cannot be said
by Mr <hi>B.</hi> who pleades for the Civill Magistrates Power in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Religion, though I think he is scarce resolved to allow
him any thing may be called Power; but that sure is of a strange
nature that ceases to be lawfull, when it is commaded by a
lawfull Magistrate: Or, thirdly, The being used in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> makes it unlawfull to be used in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
A very pretty principle truly, we must differ from them
when we have reason, and when we have not reason, when they
reproach us with separation out of pride, humour, novelty; the
most rationall way to acquit our selves sure, is, to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
we gladly will come as neare to them in Doctrine and
Discipline, as they will to Truth and pure Antiquity. We did
not in those things conform to <hi>Rome,</hi> but to the Primitive
Church, and reduce those things as it were <hi>ex postlimino,</hi> to
their native innocent usage, from which no additionall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any abroad can rationally debarre us.</p>
               <p>The last is a trim devise, <q>
                     <hi>That the King would have destroyed us,
by the</hi> Irish <hi>Rebels, who professed to raise Armes for the King. Sect.</hi> 10.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I suppose Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> can tell of some in <hi>England</hi> who professed
to fight for the King, yet never had his Commission. It seems
the King must suffer as the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> was said to doe,
not for what he had, but what he possibly might have done
hereafter. The War against the Parliament, was just upon as
good a ground; we feared they would undo the Church and
State, with their Army of Sectaries, whom they countenanced,
when he did not the Rebels in <hi>Ireland.</hi> If the King had made
use of the money raised for the relief of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the War at
home, when the poore Potestants were like to starve for want
of it, as the two Houses did; he might have been thought to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93517:14"/>
have abetted that Rebellion: The Parliament could make
such an inhumane Order for divertion of that money from the
use it was raised for, and when the King sent to them to revoke
it for their own credits sake, if not for the lives of his poor <hi>Irish</hi>
subjects, they according to their usuall rant, Voted his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suage,
a breach of priviledge, and made use of that mony to fight
against him, and yet they would be thought friends, to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If inferiour Courts of justice may prosecute the execution of their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in severall cases against the Kings will, and the Sheriff may raise
the power of the County to assist that execution, much more may the
highest Court, but the former is true, <hi>ergo.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Argument is this, If the Sheriff may raise the <hi>posse Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatûs</hi>
when by the law he is enabled so to do, <hi>ergo;</hi> the two
houses, may, though the Law doth not enable them, raise the
<hi>posse regni.</hi> Courts of judicature may use such force as doth not
disturbe the peace of the Nation, <hi>ergo</hi> the two houses may
raise a war is a far fetcht consequence. Again, The house of
Peers is solely the Court of Judicature, the major part of which
were evidently with the King.</p>
               <p>The summe of the next three leaves is. <q>The warr was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Kings person, or authority, nor to change the Government of
King, Lords, &amp;c. nor to take away the magistrates power in matters of
Religion, as appears by Protestation, solemne league Covenant, Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When I consider their Declarations for the King and their
actions against him, all I can gather is, that notwithstanding
their bitter remonstrances of the State of the Kingdome, their
unworthy, unexampled ripping up, and publishing to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
all the faults and infelicities of his raigne, (which Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were in a greater measure, the cause of in not yeelding
seasonable supply) without taking any notice of the satiafa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
made and care taken by him for prevention of the like
for the time to come, or the happy dayes men now remember
they then enjoyed (by which wayes, it is easily to render any
Government odious to the credulous and undiscerning popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy)
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93517:14"/>
notwithstanding, all this and the seditious invectives of
Pen and Pulpit, The King stood so clear in the eyes of all men,
that the being against him was a thing that they durst not
own.</p>
               <p>Though they spoyled him of his goods, and endeavoured
to do so of his good name; ruined his friends, preferred his
most enraged enemies, chased him from place to place, (they
said to bring him to his Parliament, &amp; when they caught him,
would not let him come thither) though they deprived him of
all authority as a King, by taking it into their own hands, his
liberty as a man, by imprisonment, as an husband by keeping
him from his wife, as a father from his Children, as a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
from his Chaplaines; (all which was done before the armies
purge) though they did all this; yet they said (and which is
most rediculous, some of them say so still) they were for the
King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quid verba audiam cum facta videam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their actions being such, their loyall declarations shew them
not more honest, but more dissembling; if they had too openly
discovered, they would never have compassed their intentions.
For example, one of their first proposals; without which there
could be no peace, was, That all officers civill and military, all
honours should be conferred on such as were approved by the
two houses of Parliament, see 19. <hi>Prop.</hi> The People were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to fight for so gay (as they thought it) a priviledge: Had
the English been a little plainer, (and it was, if men had not
been besorted plain enough,) <hi>viz,</hi> Except all the wealth, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
power of the Nation be shared among us and our friends,
neither King nor people shall be at quiet, in these termes, which
differ little in expression, and not at all in sense from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
the Nation would scarce have been fond of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
in order to the procuring of it.</p>
               <p>Some of their Declarations speak very fair, as it was necessary
they should, and it is a great wonder how such wise and wary
men suffered others to be so plaine, wherein they palpably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to nothing, the King and Peers</p>
               <p>To begin with the <hi>King,</hi> see the Declaration of <hi>May</hi> 26. 1642.
Where they declare, that they have power to depose the <hi>King,</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:93517:15"/>
and the King had deserved they should do so.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Now Parliaments have deposed Kings as <hi>Edw 2. Rich.</hi> 2. and
that the authors of that Declaration had a particular eye upon
those monstrous proceedings, is evident by the following
words</p>
               <p>
                  <q>All the world knows what they put in act.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the same Declaration they deny the King his Negative
Vote, so that he hath no Vote at all in making or repealing
laws, which the meanest Burgesse hath, nay the meanest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner
hath at least one that represents him, so that the <hi>King</hi> is
the onely man in the Nation (except I may now reckon the
Clergy too) that is in so high a degree of slavery, as to be bound
by laws, he in no sence concurrs to the making of. So farr
was he in 1642. from being a <hi>King,</hi> that he was not so much as
one of the free-borne people of <hi>England.</hi> This new Doctrine
they can prove (as what could not the two houses do in those
dayes,) from the very forme used, by the King to those bills he
fancied not [<hi>Le Roy Saviserà</hi>] which (say they) is a suspension
rather then a refusall of assent.</p>
               <p>A suspension (if it must be called so) was ever heretofore a
thing of that validity, that during it, they are not able to quote
one law ever reputed in force. If they thought the law to be
otherwise, they might have done very well to have declared all
the bills dashed, for so many ages, for want of the royall assent
to be obliging laws.</p>
               <p>But (alas) that forme intimates another thing, not so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
<hi>viz.</hi> That notwithstanding the two Houses are the Kings
great councill, and have presented their advice in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
Votes, yet [<hi>le Roy Savisera</hi>] the King may advise with
other men (as it is notorious in all Chronicles to have been the
practise) and take their advice if he like it better. How little
of a king they intended to leave him, see nineteen Propositions
sent the second of June in 1642 (it is to be observed what I cite
the Parliament in its purity (as the phrase is, <hi>Ex. Col. p.</hi> 307.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93517:15"/>
the summe of all which are, <q>
                     <hi>That all Peers, Iudges, Councellers, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
civill and military may be approved by themselves, all Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
affairs, Forts, Castles, Pardons, Censures, New Oaths, The Mariage
Government of his own Children, may be at the disposall of the two
houses.</hi>
                  </q> After the forementioned declaration of <hi>May</hi> 26. the
ordinance concerning the Militia, these Propositions, I would
willingly know in what consists the authority of the King,
which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saies, <hi>he and they swore, and fought to defend;</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they could not call him Soveraign without a jeere. If the
houses have once this Power, let them be sworne to defend us,
and no longer let us mock God, the King, and the world with
giving an oath to a man to do that we our selves have rendred
it as impossible for him to do, as the Chaire in his Presence
Chamber.</p>
               <p>The King complaines in severall of his Declarations, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
that of <hi>August</hi> the 12. 1642. of severall insolent speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
which passed in the house of Commons unreproved, as of
Mr. <hi>Martin</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Kings Office was forfeitable, that the happinesse of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

Ex Coll. p 28.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be said these things were done in the height of
passion, when the sence of those grievances they lately fancied
they felt, was fresh upon them. Afterwards they were more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate:
as I have shewed how the Parliament went at the very
beginning of the Warr upon those principles, their freinds
now would be thought to detest; I will briefly demonstrate they
went by the same when the Warr was ended, even whilst it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Presbyterian, for I shall not once mention what was
done after the seclusion of Members by the Army, and shall
quote no Historian but him who wrote alwayes for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Mr <hi>May</hi> who in his <hi>Historiae Parl. Breviatium, p. 146 tells
us, that on the fiftteenth of</hi> July 1646. <hi>there were propositions sent by
the hands of some Lords, and commons, and Commissioners for the Scots
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93517:16"/>
The King looked upon those proposals as derogatory to his Crown, injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to his people, as inconsistent with the quiet of the Nation, as of his own
conscience, and therefore demurred upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earle of <hi>Lounden</hi> tells the King in a trim Oration, that
unlesse he will agree to those propositions which himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
very hard ones, it is to be feared, he would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and the nation setle in another way of Government
without him or any of his Posterity. The King resolved, he
would not give them his Crown, they must take it forcibly if
they would have it, after that, he was their Prisoner, now he
was from his evill Councill, one would have thought they
would have desired him at least, not have denyed him to come
nere his Parliament.</p>
               <p>His usage was various, sometimes their malice made him
know what it was to be confined, other times more civilly
bitter, it allowed him as much ceremonious Royalty as might
put him in mind of what he had been.</p>
               <p>About <hi>Dec.</hi> 1647 (for want of something else to do) they
treat with the King, but he must grant foure previous proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the first and last of which would serve to dethrone him,
and the other two to affront him, which certainly they would
never have asked, had they not resolved to be denied. But
great ills cannot be maintained, but by acting greater, they
would not allow the King any power, because they feared what
they deserved, as it is usually seen, that they that sin beyond
all example, think they sin beyond all possibility of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
so these (though they might have had the greatest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for their safety, themselves could imagine, so that they
needed fear nothing, but guilty consciences) thought the King
and themselves could not both be secure.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, on the third of <hi>January</hi> the Kings refusall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figne

May <hi>Breviarium Hist. Parl. p.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of the War it was necessary for them
(though they did act quite contrary) to say they would make
the King a great and glorious King, and it was not impossible,
but some fools might beleeve them: but that after these Votes
passed, publ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shed and maintained in a declaration set out to
that purpose, &amp; suitable usage, they should dare to this day to
professe they alwayes were for the King, his Person and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
is arrogantly monstrous, unlesse at the same time they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
away their Princes liberty they thought they could vote
away his Peoples reasons too.</p>
               <p>It is true, they afterwards recalled those Votes, and sent some
termes to the King, which the necessity of affaires caused him to
condiscend to, but if it he remembred what previous concessions
there were, what an odious preface, how harsh the Propositions
were to the disparagement, as well as the undoing of all his
friends? what fear themselves were then in of their own army?
will think the King obliged to thank them only when he hath
nothing else to do?</p>
               <p>How well the Pretences for the King have been seconded,
with unfit performances, hath been in some measure seene, the
next enquiry must be about the Peers; whether the pulling the
sun out of the firmament, hath been an effectuall way to make
the starrs shine more gloriously. The Bishops at the beginning
of the Parliament, were at the least so many Barons (if not the
third state) and had as undoubted a right to fit there, as the law
could give, to any man or men of this Nation, they were a more
ancient (I add, and a more considerable part of the Parliament
then the whole house of Commons, as having part of the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative
power in them, which the other had not) yet were they
affronted, menaced, and endangered by tumults, which the
Lords would have suppressed, and the Commons encouraged.
But of this before, The Lords (seeing the Commons would not
joyne) appoint a writ (by the advice of the Judges) to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected

the Constables to attend about <hi>Westminster,</hi> to hinder that
unlawfull conflux of people, which the Commons without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <p>The Bill concerning the <hi>Militia</hi> (a most considerable bill)
was sent to the King by the house of Commons alone, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the express refusall of the house of Peers, as themselves
confesse. <hi>Ex. Col. p.</hi> 59. However, they may talk they were for
the old constitution of King, Lords and Commons, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
the grandees were for neither full and free; but so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of each as would serve their turne. After the bill for the
<hi>Militia</hi> had been rejected twice in the house of Peers, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all law, reason, Presidents, forced upon them again,
and to fright the Peers into agreement, it was said there. <hi>[That
whoever would not consent, &amp;c. was an enemy to the Commonwealth,]</hi>
and the same day Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> contrary sure to the freedom of
Parliaments, demanded to know who were against it; much to
this purpose may be read in <hi>Ex. Col. p.</hi> 547. 548. What was that
ridiculous proposall that the minor part of the Lords might
joyn with the Major part of the Commons, That threatning
Petition that they might protest against the dissenting Lords,
and that other, that the good Lords might sit in the same house
with the Commons, but devices to aw the Peers? What was
the unparliamentary course of forcing bills upon the House of
Lords after severall times being cast out, but a down right tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them, <hi>they were resolved to take no deniall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The House of Commons made an order against an establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Law, concerning the Common Prayer, the Lords made an
order for the observance of it, which the Commons very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly
declare against, the nineth of <hi>September, Ex Col p</hi> 526.</p>
               <p>The house of Peers was certainly of very great authority,
when an Order of theirs in behalf of an established law, was
not equivalent to one of the lower House; in direct opposition
to an established law</p>
               <p>Again, The protestation being so early, whatever the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93517:17"/>
was, the termes in common prudence ought not to be too
offensive, but presently they perceived that their surest friends
the haire-brained Sectaryes would not endure to be bound <hi>[to
observe the Doctrine of the Church of England]</hi> Whereupon those
words in the protestation were explayned by a declaration of
the house of Commons onely, to be intended onely so sar, <hi>as it
is opposite to Popery,</hi> The house of Peers taking an Oath, to be too
sacred to admit of so jugling an interpretation, refused to joyn
with them in it. Presently the house of Commons (who would
accept of the Peers assent, when it might be had, and when it
could not, would act without it, so excellent observers were
they of the ancient constitution) voted it by their sole autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<hi>That all people who would not take that Protestation so interpreted,
unfit to bear any office in the Common-wealth</hi> After all these actions,
I hope a few good words will not acquit them: Nor will it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
any thing with intelligent men, what is next urged.</p>
               <p>That, <q>The Covenant was for King and Parliament.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Covenant is lyable to more exceptions then at present
I am willing to take, the very designe was extreamly scandalous,
and as great a blow to Religion, I am perswaded, as it ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cei<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

in the world, as representing it; to be the parent of the
worst of vices, rebellions, sacriledge and perjury: some men
have adventured to teach, that God is the author of all sin:
these men come very neer them, that can do the worst of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies
upon his score, fear God and break his commandements;
and all upon the newly revealed Doctrine of Piety and Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Surely, Humility, Patience, self-deniall, taking up the Cross,
loving enemies, praying for persecutors, are things commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
only to pusillanimous and morrall men. Hath the spirit
that came down upon Christ in the forme of a Dove, appeared
since in the shape of a Vulture or a Roman Eagle? was it weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
not religion, that kept the primitive Ch<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>stians obedient;
must whatever they said about Rebelion be construed with this
tacite reserve, untill we have an opportunity. We read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a blessing laid up for those who in defence of Christ and
his truth part with their Lands, Houses or Life; but not of any
for those, who upon that score invade other mens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That there
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93517:18"/>
were no rewards appointed for those who killed Tyrants, <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan</hi>
esteemed it as a defect in policy, and it is one in religion
too. He might as easily observed it to be an omission in the
Law of God as man.</p>
               <p>The quarrel was not then about Doctrine so much as discipline,
our articles were esteemed Orthodox, our discipline not appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
enough: Their discipline <hi>in terminis</hi> in Scripture, and as a
command to introduce it with fire and sword, in defiance of
Prince and Laws, are surely to be found in the same chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>These tender Consciences are very prety things, that dare
not conform to an indifferent Ceremony, in obedience to all
the authority the law of <hi>England</hi> takes notice Civill or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall,
without an expresse command or example of Christ or
his Apostles; and yet without either, can take up arms against
their Soveraign, plunder and slay all, whose Consciences are
not of the same size.</p>
               <p>The Covenant (not to mention upon what grounds they
who at first Idolized it, do now look upon it, as an abominable
Idoll) lyes open to very just, and very many material Ob<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
It being my businesse onely by the by; I shall onely inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
those that are so obvious, that they cannot escape a very
ordinary observer.</p>
               <p>First, It is directly contrary to the Oath of Supremacy, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
taken, wherein they swear, <hi>the King to be the o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ely supream
Governour in all Causes as well Ecclesiastical as Temporall;</hi> which
power they there swear to defend; and by resolving to reform
the Church without, nay against his direct Command, they now
as absolutely (with an Oath too) deny it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is contrary to the Oaths of Canonical obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to their Ordinary, Bishops, Chancellors, &amp;c. which those
of them which had entered into Orders took, and conscienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
observed by swearing their utter exterpation; a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they by subsciption testified to be lawfull, which judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
many of them were known, never to change till it was
their interest (the late usuall season of conversion) so to do. And
some think a good Bishoprick would seduce many of them to
their old errour again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:93517:18"/>
Thirdly, Ecclesiasticall affaires never were, nor can be by
the law of <hi>England</hi> (which they broke even in this very act of
Covenanting for the laws, as they said) consulted on in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but onely to have (the civill Sanction) and that
after (the law is expresse) they have been determined by the
Clergy in Convocation: See [<hi>The Reformation of the Church of</hi>
England <hi>Justified</hi>] a whole book to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Now whether the Assembly of Divines, being not called by
the King, who alone hath power by the Law to do it, nor elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Clergy, who alone have power to send (the true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
not dissolved) may be called, <hi>The Clergy in Convocation:</hi>
I will leave to any one to determine, and onely observe, that
as in other illegall Acts, the late Powers proceeded according
to their example; so in this particularly, Their naming what
members they pleased, without Election of the Clergy, to sit in
the Assembly, was a fit President for <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> to call whom
he pleased, without choice of the Country, to sit in the little
Parliament. The State and Church was pulled down the same
way.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Covenant could not be imposed, according
to the Doctrine of the long Parliament, who <hi>Ex Col. p.</hi> 859. tels
us, <hi>Men are not to be compelled to be sworn without an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which certainly, the Votes of the two Houses are not: I
shall not prosecute these things any further, but observe some
few particulars in the Covenant it self; and onely wonder, with
what face (not to say, with what Conscience) men, the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Champions of our Liberty, and of no part, so much as our
Consciences, in regard of Oaths, imposed even by an unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
Authority, could on the sudden use such barbarous ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
toward the freeborn people of <hi>England,</hi> for not taking that
Oath, which themselves had (according to the fore-cited Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine)
no power to impose; and the others had the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ommand
of the Prince, Law, and unanswered Reason to refuse; at least,
they could say what themselves once thought enough, it was
against their Consciences.</p>
               <p>We shall now examine, whether there is any amends made in
the Materiall Cause, for the faultinesse of the Efficient; and
there is a presumption that it is so; sure, such good men would
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93517:19"/>
not involve their Country in the miseries of a War, resist their
Prince, but in an order to a thing that was very excellent, if
not necessary: That assertion in the Preface which gives chief
countenance to the undertaking, is a most horrible falsity, that
it was [<hi>according to the Commendable practise of these kingdomes in
former times, and the example of Gods people in other Nations.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>England</hi> hath behaved her self so commendably, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to make it out, to have been her practise: whosoever
swears it to have been, untill he can produce his instances, if he
doth not meet with very charitable persons will be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as one horribly Perjured: The Churches of God (if there
were any before Presbytery Rebelled into a being) whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
may be Rules to us; must be either the holy men before
the law, under the law, or the Primitive Christians, beofore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was made a Bawde to Interest. He that thinks there can
be a thing fetcht from their doings in favour of this league, let
him serve that cause so far as to attempt [<hi>The History of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi>]
and see how many examples he can produce of Fighters
with their Prince, for not introducing a form of Worship they
better liked of, than what was by law established.</p>
               <p>The Covenants we read of in Scripture, were not against the
King, but with the King, nor when the Kings refused, doe we
read that the Prophets ever exhorted the People to such at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.
But no remedy <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

they will swear with hands lifted up to Heaven; this matter of
fact, though they do not know it to be so; nay, though they
know it not to be so; and which is prodigiously strange: One
of the first argu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Narrative tells us, that there never was such a Thing seen in the
world before.</p>
               <p>It might be observed, that Errour is far incorporated with
her Tenents, that what is true in it self, is false when they speak
it; as almost the very first word [<hi>All living under one King</hi>] ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

much as we have three Parliaments in the three Nations; and
in my weak judgment, appointing all Officers, Declaring who
are Offenders and uncapable of mercy; resolving to reform
Church and State according to their own modell, against the
Kings expresse Will and Command, are no great evidences of
living <hi>under him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first Article is, <q>To endeavour the preservation of the Religion

               <p>By those words, <hi>according to the word of God,</hi> They use to mean

Ceremony was the common Question: But so, the forms of

by Classes, Assemblies, higher and lower, are not so well
known in <hi>England;</hi> muchlesse so clear in the word of God, that
every Artisan can in an instant be so assured, that they are there
as to swear it in judgement: this Oath is by so much the more
oppressive &amp; intolerable, that it is not satisfied with a quiet sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

but obliges every man zealously and constantly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
it.</p>
               <p>There is in this Article more jugling then is tolerable in so
sacred a thing as an Oath; their friends being of so severall
parties, neither of which would be content, the Church should

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:93517:20"/>
But that the Sectarian Brethren of no sort may be displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
the word of God is expressely said to be the rule, by which
each Sect were sure of carrying the cause their own way; and if
any had a peculiar fancy to <hi>New-England,</hi> or any other Church;

That the Covenant was taken in the various senses, and with
different hopes every one knows, and that the ambiguous pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
gives each party ground for it, it is fondnesse to deny.</p>
               <p>To please those who were for Church-government, they
Covenanted against Schism, but least they should displease
those who were against Church Government, they could never

               <p>The <hi>Common enemies,</hi> this Oath engageth men against, must

this, That Government in the judgment of very many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters,

upon whom the guilt of Perjury lyes very heavy, for
breaking their former Oaths, leavying War against their King,
disturbing the peace of the Nation, turning so many gallant
men convict of no crime, but their lands, which other men had
a minde to be guilty of, and they had as good a right to as
the law of <hi>England</hi> could give; and all upon the sole point of
inexpediency: Into this point I shall dive no further; but take
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93517:20"/>
some small notice of the reason here rendred, for this certainly
illegall Act of pulling down that Government of the Church,
without the Kings Authority, <hi>lest they be partakers of other mens
sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doe not apprehend that ever I read words more destructive
to every Government, and to the peace of every Nation in the
world, they sound thus; [Whensoever there is a Government
or form of worship in the Church, which we doe not believe to
be according to the word of God, we are bound in Conscience
(nay they of another Nation are, as the <hi>Scots</hi> were to us, who
upon this Reason, Vow to extirpate our Bishops) to take up
Arms, though it be against our King, and reform, for if we doe
not, we make our selves guilty of other mens sins.] A proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that creates a perpetuall Apology for crafty men, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies,
nay, necessitates the vilest attempts of deluded ones. The

dayes attempted no more then this warrants. If this Doctrine
were true, I wonder the Prophets and Priests of old, that lived
under Idolatrous Princes were nor carefuller of their own souls,
and lift up their voice like a Trumpet in another sense, than
the Scripture mentions them to have done. There cannot easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be imagined greater occasion for such irregular proceedings,
if they are at all justifiable in any Nation, then in the Jewish;
their Princes being so often and so strangely guilty of Idolatry,
(a crime clearly by their law described and forbidden) yet we
doe not finde that the People ever thought themselves, or the
Prophets ever told them, they were obliged to attempts of that
nature. I will use my pen no longer in this Argument, because
it ought to be confu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

sure I am, it will pull down every Government, that doth not
pull down it: More especially, by reason of that clause in the
Conclusion, wherein, each private man swears to <hi>go before
other in the work of Reformation,</hi> words of very horrid import, as
obliging every man to disturb the Nation in pursuit of his own
or anothers dreams, if he could but fancy it to be a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
their full latitude might have been understood, if <hi>Walling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93517:21"/>
who first infused into men such pernicious doctrine,
and then because the horridnesse of it would affright men of
any good nature from it, bound them to it by an Oath; and
lastly, gave them swords into their hands to justifie the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
conclusion, the maddest can draw; and all this, <hi>As they
shall Answer it at the great Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little after, they expresse a right Presbyterian spirit, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
desire to see all Christendome in a flame, That, <q>Their
proceeding may be encouragement to other Christian Churches growing
under, or in danger of the yoake of Antichristian Tyranny to joyn in
the same or like Association or Covenant.</q> In which words, all people
whose Princes are Papists (or something else, which they did
not stick formerly to call Antichristian) are absolved from their
obedience and encouraged to Rebell, and those who are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

small a thing creates such a danger, <hi>England</hi> may remember)
they may be rid of that and their Allegiance together, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for their security as they please. Here is a great want of
Prudence to give Forraign Princes such timely notice, of such
projected Rebellions, and of the men they are in danger of:
And a great want of charity to Forraign Churches, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
them all as enemies to the State, whereby they may be
put out of their good esteem if not protection.</p>
               <p>But some men have Preached and Printed, not onely down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right

               </p>
               <p>I shall conclude this point with this one note, The Doctrine
that allows private men to resist Magistrates, upon the score of
Religion, is in it self so horrid &amp; black in its consequences, that
none dare own it, that can defend themselves any other way,
accordingly the fancy of the coordinate Power of the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
was entertained with mighty applause, by the Brethren of
the Presbytery, because it salved this grand Objection of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion;
a sin (which after that happy discovery of their being
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93517:21"/>
free from) they disclaimed against, no men more: <q>Prove the
King Supream, and then I will yeeld myself a Rebell,</q> so Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
in his <hi>Preface;</hi> And so they all acknowledging it unlawfull for
Subjects to resist their Soveraign, contrary to language of the
former Pamphlets, Rebellion: they gladly acknowledged to
be a sin in all men but themselves; But that device of coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
suiting onely to this particular juncture of affaires, by
no means serving to acquit the <hi>Scots</hi> tumults, or Armies, or to
incense their brethren beyond Sea, they having no Parliament,
or of no such pretence of share in the Government, and very
like to oppose such designes, if they had any such power, the
Covenant revives the former Doctrine, and advises the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
beyond <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ea to set themselves free, as if errour in points of
belief did deprive Princes, (though it doth no man else) of his
natural or civill power or rights: Thus are they loath any one
Nation should be peaceable or prince happy.</p>
               <p>We shall now examine that clause of the Covenant, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so much boast of, <hi>viz.</hi> that concerning the preservation
of the Kings person.</p>
               <q>To preserve the Kings Person and Authority, in the preservation and
defence of the true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdome.</q>
               <p>That they deprived the King of all Authority, is proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
That his person was not the King, themselves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and contend for, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rgo,</hi> he is not at all provided for in this
Article. That the putting the King to death was no breach of
Covenant; I might prove many wayes, but I shall refer Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> to Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> his fellow-labourer in the War and Word;
who in the defence of the Honourable Sentence, argues thus,
shrewdly, I think, <hi>ad homines, p. 53. He was not then a King, but a
Subject, and so lyable to processe of law;</hi> for that blood they so often
preached him guilty of, <hi>Deposed he was</hi> (saith he) <hi>by themselves
and their party;</hi> when they denyed subjection to him, withdrew
their obedience from him, acknowledged a power superiour to
him, <hi>viz</hi> the Parliament, leavyed War against him as a Traitor,
as an Enemy to the Kingdome, chased him from place to place,
and at last imprisoned his person, and there was no clause in the
Covenant, for the preservation of a <hi>person</hi> that onec was <hi>King.</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:93517:22"/>
Nor doth this Article promise us any thing better, when they
shot their Cannons directly at the place where their treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Informers discovered the King to be; they said, it was in his
defence, because in the defence of the two Houses, where his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
(forsooth) resided. Another cast of the same Logick may
make it out, that deposing, nay killing the King, if in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of true Religion shall be preserving him too, because in
defence of that, where his Person may as properly be said to
reside, as his Authority where they placed it. This Article at
the best is but conditionall, if he defends what they please to
think or call the true Religion, and the Liberties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And what his performance was in their judgement, I
might cite almost all their Sermons, Pamphlets, Declarations;
but I will content my self till further provocation, with the
Admonition of their gude brethren of the Kyrke of <hi>Scotland,
May</hi> Hist. p. 108 <hi>That he was very much guilty of Idolatry, Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
of the Murder of many thousands of his best Subjects;</hi> with much
more to that purpose. If I delighted to render the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
odious, here I might do it to purpose, but transcribe
some of their Sermons, and the work were done. I shall for this
time forbear, and onely use a little, which is necessary to my
purpose, and commonly known, and already taken notice of
by Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> whose book lying under so publick a Censure,
is very like to be read by most: Mr. <hi>Love</hi> in his Sermon at <hi>Vx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>

               <p>That they preached against putting the King to death, the
Presbyterian Ministers urge strongly and with much applause
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> themselves, though indeed it signifies as much as just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
the reason is clear, while the Parliament Declared, and
the Army fought for, Presbytery and the King opposed it, none
were more vehement obstructers of all the designes tending to
his restitution then the Ministers; for so long they had hopes
by that means, that all the Lands, Power of the Bishops, Deans,
and Chapters, the best Parsonages should be divided among
them: But when the Independents out-witted them, and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have perfectly learned their lesson they taught them of
declaiming against something, as an humane invention, in the
form of worship of those whose lands they longed for; then
and not till then, they would have been content to have joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the King against that Army, themselves had joyned
with and raised against the King. When the Votes no further
Addresse were first passed by men they had hopes of, which of
them then abhominated the dethroning of their Prince. I shall
make this quere (if it be not absu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d in so clear a matter to make
a quere)</p>
               <p>Whether if the Parliament and Army had joyned together
as one man to set up high Presbytery, divided the Church lands
among them, and the King had refused to yeeld his assent to
such illegall Acts, they would have pleaded the Covenant in
his behalf, and thus loudly talked for his restitution to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
let their friends speak.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:93517:23"/>
That upon such terms as they pleased, they would restore
him, is no more then the very Army would have done, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Sentence passed, came and offered him conditions.</p>
               <p>They merit the lesse by their last appearing (as they call it)
for the King, in as much as in that juncture of affaires, it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very unlikely they should-subsist without him: The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ant
were exploded every where; the Army called it a Carnal
thing; the Sectaries in the City, said it was a thing ridiculous
to unhorse Episcopacy and set Presbytery in the Saddle; to be
rid of my Lord Bishop, and doe twice the homage to Sr. <hi>John
Presbyter;</hi> their own arguments were retorted upon them: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
were not Lord Bishops, shew where they had their thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
<hi>per annum</hi> changed into? the Apostles were not Parochial
Ministers, shew where they had tythes that at such a time as this?
they would have been content to have been maintained by the
Common Enemy against their best friends, is what they think
highly obliging? This was that great piece of Loyalty, they
would have had the King saved, when it was the onely way to
save themselves.</p>
               <p>A King Deposed is surely not looked upon as a King, by those
who depose them; now if imprisoning, passing Votes of no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Addresse, doth not depose a King; I would fain know what
doth? Being in that condition, and guilty of so much blood as
they all along declared him to be, when those words of the
Covenant, of <hi>Bringing all Delinquents to justice without respect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
should have come to be considered? How much further
they might have proceeded, had not the power been snatched
out of their hands by their Servants, as themselves had done
to their Master; I leave to their past words and works to
declare? They did indeed recall those Votes of no Addresse,
and Treated with the King, but it was when they could no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
be rid of the Army, but by joyning with the King and
Nation against them; and even then, they so perplexed the
King, and protracted time with terms and punctilio's of proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure;
and were so dissatisfied, with whatever the King offered,
whilest they had the shadow of any power, that the Army had
opportunity to break off that Treaty the Houses would not end.</p>
               <p>That part of the Covenant that concerns <hi>the Priviledge of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93517:23"/>
Parliament,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his side are very confident they have
inviolably observed; let us and them consider what was before
said of the Tumults and the Scots Army, the affronting and
assaulting the Bishops, and other Lords; the posting up of the
dissenting Members names of both Houses, and which is above
all, their illegall turning men out for having a hand in some
Patent, Monopoly or other, which they might as well have
done, for having been guilty of any fault; having red Hair or
a Roman Nose; which action, whether it did not null all their
proceedings, <hi>eo ipso,</hi> as making it no House, by fecl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

fairely elected, some make a very great question.</p>
               <p>Before I take the Covenant, I shall make this one not unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
request, that I might know the Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
first, and swear to them afterwards; one example may
not be tedious.</p>
               <p>On the 3d. of <hi>January</hi> 1641. It was declared, <hi>To offer to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
or detain any member without first acquainting the House, is a
breach of Priviledge,</hi> Ex. Coll. p. 35. The palpable absurdity of
this Doctrine being discovered by the King in one of his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and other Treatises in <hi>Novemb. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Member without order from the House, and detain him in custody till
be may be brought to parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas I represented the Covenanters to be pernicious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to every Government, their dealings with our late Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
force me to retract part of that Assertion, or at least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
it, so as to be intended onely of lawfull ones; For to U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers

They will not molest their Prince, no not for their <hi>Covenant;</hi>

               <p>The reasons of which prodigious dealing are these, <hi>I am

here, the death of the former Prince, being all that was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to compleat the title of the latter, whom no act, no not an
Attainder in Parliament could debar from his Throne, the
Parliament deriving its Authority from the Writ of the Prince,
without Authority from whom as King already, they could not
have met: <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

in any degree argumentative; I have left out much which I
might pertinently, and truly have urged, because I would not
mention any thing which might seem exasperating: For I
could heartily wish the Parliament could passe such an act of
Oblivion, that all that is past may be not only pardoned but
forgot: There hath certainly so much of folly as well as impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
been seen in our late Proceedings, that it were much for the
credit of this present age; if posterity would give as little cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to those who tell them these things were so, as we fools did
to those wise and honest men, who time enough before hand
told us they would be so. If any thing in these papers seem
offensive (though I have taken all possible care nothing should)
to some men, who think the onely way to secure their honour
and innocence is to be angry, I do assure them, the rubbing
upon the sore places, was not to hinder the healing, or to vex,
and inflame the distempred parts, but onely to free them from
that errour of taking themselves to be whole already; If any
thing here may be of use to any reader, I shall think my pains
well bestowed, however I shall at any time gladly hazard, mor<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
