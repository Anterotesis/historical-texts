            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A NEW ART OF Brewing, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THO' I have no other Design, in respect of Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then only to save them a great deal of Pains, and no small part of their daily Charge, and towards the rest of Mankind, but an honest and most charitable Intention of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertizing them what may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, both to the Health of their Bodies, Tranquility of their Minds, and Advantage of their Estates; yet I am not so Ignorant of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43078:4"/>
Worlds common usage, as not to expect, that offering to Disswade from certain inveteral (but mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous) Customs, I am like to meet with no less than Hate or Reproach, or at least Scorn and Contempt, from the greatest part of those, whose welfare I would gladly promote. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as the Conscience of my own Innocence, and certain Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Knowledge of the Truth, of what I Recommend will be a sufficient Buckler against all the Darts of Envy, Ingratitude, Noise and Folly: So I do not Despair, but this small Treatise may have the happiness to meet with some few, so little wedded to Tradition and their own Humours, as to be willing to hearken to the Dictates of Wisdom, Reason, and Nature, wherever they meet them, or though communicated in an homely manner, by a very weak and imperfect Instrument. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43078:4"/>
there should scarce be any man that hath ever enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Thoughts for one half hour, in a serious Consideration of his own Structure, and how and by what Natural means he doth subsist in this World, but must have taken notice, that as the Substance of our Bodies suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a daily Expence, Decay, or Wasting, as well by the action of our own innate (or inbread heat) prespiration of Spirits, and the more pure parts of the Humours thorow the pores of the Skin, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the Ambient Air, as by the common and more gross Evacuations; so there is required a daily supply of Nourishment to repair and make good whatsoever is thus spent of the Store which is provided to support and preserve the Microcosm.</p>
            <p>To this End, as outwardly the All-wise and most Bountiful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has prepared variety of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43078:5"/>
Foods and Liquors; so inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he has both given us Reason, Wisdom, and Knowledge (if we will hearken to and exert it) to distinguish which of them are at all times best and most requisite for us; as also fixed the Members and Organs of our Bodies, in their several places and offices, to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting and subservient to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in order to the effecting of this admirable Work.</p>
            <p>Of these the Stomach is the first and principal Agent, which as it were a Kitchin, serves to dress and prepare all Meats that are brought into it, and by its Concocting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty reduses them into a white milky Substance, which is called <hi>Chyle,</hi> which passing thence throughout the lower Orifice of the Stomach into the Intrails, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there but a slow passage (by reason of many turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by which the Guts are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually inclosed and united to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43078:5"/>
Mesentery) it is further digested and seperated, and the purer part by the Mesoraick Veins (called the Hands of the Liver) is thorough the Veins (from the Office called <hi>Vena Porta</hi>) carried into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low parts of the Liver, whereby a higher and more elaborate Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is turned into that admirable Balsamick Liquor, called <hi>Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Blood passes from thence into the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> or great hollow Vein, whose Trunk divides it self into two large Branches, the one tending downwards to carry blood to the lower parts; the other up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and mounteth even to the Throat, dividing again by the way into other Branches, one of which fasteneth it self to the right Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart, by which the blood is brought thither from the Liver, where being yet higher e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laborated and inriched, 'tis trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted or carried over to the left Ventricle, where the Arteries takes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43078:6"/>
their original, which contains the Vital Blood and Spirits, whose Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it is to enliven and exercise the Faculties of the Body.</p>
            <p>By other Branches it ariseth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Brain, where the Animal Spirits are made, being the Seat of Phansie, Reason, Judgment, and Memory (which noble Faculties by those Spirits are exercised) as also of all Sense and Motion; for from the Brain are all the Nerves (or Sinews) divided into all the parts, which cause a voluntary Motion in the Body, by which it walks, stands, lyes down, labours, rises, or useth any other Exercise, according to the Dictates of the Will, which cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ministry of the Nerves.</p>
            <p>Thus you see the whole oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of Nature, how, what is received at the Mouth is turned into Chyle by the Stomach, that Chyle into Blood by the Liver. Of the purer parts of the Blood
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43078:6"/>
are made Vital Spirits by the Heart, and Animal Spirits by the Brain, all which being thorow the Veins and Arteries (like so many Channels or Conduict Pipes) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the principal Member, and from thence by abundance of smaller Vessels into every part of the Body, Growth and Vigour at least, a continual and suitable Supply ought to be thereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the whole.</p>
            <p>But if what is taken into the Body, that is, our Meats and Drinks, be either improper in quality, or too great in quantity, it does in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther case disturb this curious oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, and frustrate Natures In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and Operations; for as unwholsom Meats and Drinks must needs give an unwholsom Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (the Effects always precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating quality consentaneous to its Causes) and every thing delighteth to produce its Simile's, so if the Errors be only in quantity (which

tho' too frequent, yet rarely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens without the other) the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence is still worse, Excess in Eating and Drinking laying the Foundations of almost all Diseases; for scarce could the Starry Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, Injuries of Insalubrious Air, various Seasons of the Year, and the like External Accidents, have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to beget Diseases, unless the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy were predisposed to receive their Effects by ill Humours, is the Result of Indigestions, and original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caused from the Faculties of the Stomach being abased and perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for when the Stomach is nautiated with disagreable Food or Drink, or over-charged with Excess, it cannot conceal and turn such Matters into good Chyle (but not being able to contain it long) thorow ill Crude, as it is into the Intrails, which being also oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, cannot so speedily conveigh thorow them the indigested load, but it receiveth there an imperfect
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43078:7"/>
alteration, and so is by the Veins of the Mesentery drawn away to the Liver, which being likewise indisposed at the receipt of such unprepared Matter, is as unable to convert the unequal Mass into good Blood, but thrusts it out into the larger Veins, mixed and infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with evil Humours, and from thence to the Heart the Seat of Life, (which like a Lamp almost drown'd with Oyl) is even stifled and overcome; thence also it is carried to the Brain (the Fountain of Sense and Motion) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clouded with Vapors and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Humours, its Faculties are interrupted, the brisk and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Phansie clogged and dulled, Reason mudled, and Judgment vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, and all the admirable Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of Memory oppressed and confounded; from these nobler Parts and larger Vessels, it is throghout the small ones spread all over the Body, every part taking
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43078:8"/>
its unhappy share, and by reason of the want of its due Concoction in the principal Members, cannot give due Nourishment to those parts remote; but by these Errors often repeated, the Harmony of Nature is every where disturbed, and the whole Body made a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazin of corrupt Humours, which (like home-bred Traitors in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) are continually ready to let in fierce and cruel Diseases upon the least External Attack, or (if that be wanting) will from their own Malignity (as Domestick Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Insurrections are caused in ill govern'd States) creates Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances within, endangering the Peace both of Body and Mind, and even threatning Subversion to the Throne of Life. By what has been said, it appears of what vast Importance, due Consideration, and Caution in our Meats and Drinks is, not only for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Health of Body, Prevention
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43078:8"/>
of Diseases, but also in order to the obtaining Serenity of Mind and Calm Affections, and the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all our Intellectual Faculties, 'tis an old Rule, <hi>The Passions of the Mind follow the Temperatement of the Body</hi>; for such Diet as you use, such will be your Blood; and as your Blood is pure, or impure, such will be your Spirits, Natural, Vital, and Animal, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all Functions and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Body and Mind shall suitably be altered. Take a man never so modest, just and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let him over-charge himself with strong Liquor, what a strange Metamorphize, altogether incredible, did not the lamentable frequency convince us, shall it make, as if some Body had stoln away the Man, and left a Beast, or rather a Devil in his shape; so do we not daily fee, that those who addict themselves to Gluttony (tho' not so soon, yet in time as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43078:9"/>
certainly as the other) lose their Parts, and of sharp, witty, judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Persons, become Fools and stupid Sots: But of the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of improper Foods, and Excess even in the most Innocent, I have even at large Treated in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my Writings; not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as occasionally, to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereof here; but the main Scope of this present Treatise shall relate to Drink, and some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Foods, that may be proper for such as are afflicted with the Stone and Gravel, and also the Sorts they ought to forbear (not so much to shew the odiousness of that Swinish sin, Drunkenness, nor in admonishing those who think themselves, and are by others numbred amongst the most sober, that even they are guilty of great Excess in the quantity of Liquor, as well as in the quality, which through ill Customs they swallow down beyond the necessity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43078:9"/>
but especially to take notice of the ill quality of those Liquors that are used by most People, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising from their undue Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to shew both the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons how and why the same do breed Diseases in Human Bodies; as also to offer Remedies whereby the same may be prevented, and Drink truly refreshing, exhilera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and friendly to Nature, made and accommodated to General Use.</p>
            <p>The first step towards the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Stone and Gravel, as also the Gout, Consumption, and various other Diseases of the like Nature, is the frequent drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of strong, hot, sharp, intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating stale Liquors, and fiery pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Drinks, as Beer high boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Hops, Brandy, Rum, old Wines, especially Claret and Whitewine, which for the most part tend towards a Spirit, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Heat and Sharpness, becoming its
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43078:10"/>
predominating quality, all such Drinks do, in such Constitutions by Simile, contract and generate in the Passages and Ureters a hard gretty Substance, and of a mixt Saturnine Martial Nature, which is the first principle and beginning of the Disease called the <hi>Stone,</hi> and all its Symptoms and Attendances. Nor is that the only Evil thereby occasioned in the Human Nature, for such Liquors do too violently stir up and evaporate the pure es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Spirits, and as it were burn up the sweet Oyl or Humour <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicallis,</hi> the Balsom of Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Blood becomes Infected with a sharp hot quality, and its free Circulation is obstructed, which Causes unnatural or burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som heat in all the External Parts, and lays the Seeds of various Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, according to the Nature of each Constitution, Country, and Clymate, as Consumptions, Palsies, Fevers, Gout, Stone, and the like.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:43078:10"/>Secondly, It is also to be noted and considered, the boyling of Hops two, three, or four hours in Beer, is a thing of a pernicious Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, tho' it be unadvised, and ignorantly practised, they falsly i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that there Drink will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the better thereby, whereas indeed they do by that Error, in a great measure, evaporate or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focate the pure Spirits, which are the Preservers of the sweet friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Balsamick Body, in all things whence the amiable, meek, or mild opening quality do exist, which whilst any thing remain intire or unviolated, is the Moderater and Qualifier, or the harsh, bitter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringent Nature; therefore Hops and Beer so boyled do prove very injurious to several Constitutions; for after Drink is thus prepared, the predominant quality in it is, hot, fulsom, strong, and bitter, and of a restringent Nature and Operation, prejudicial to Health,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43078:11"/>
especially to all such persons, who by their Constitutions are subject or inclinable unto the Stone or Gravel.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is further to be considered, That the boyling of Wort, or any Spirituous Liquor that is drawn or extracted from things, whose Body is opened by Firmentation, as Mault is in a very high degree, does not only destroy and evaporate the fine, thin, subtle Spirits and Quality, which are only capable of Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, but it does, as it were, fix or stagnate the whole, by which it becomes of a grosser, fuller, or stronger taste in the Mouth, which through Use, Custom, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is esteemed a Vertue or Strength; but the contrary is to be understood; for thereby it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of a heavier Operation, lies longer in the Stomach, sending gross Fumes and Vapours, into the Crown, and Seldom fails to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43078:11"/>
obstruct the Passages, because it hath lost great part of those fine penetrating properties, which is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily demonstrated to your Senses; (<hi>viz.</hi>) Unboyled Wort hath a fine pleasant sweetness in taste, and it is of an opening, cleansing quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and operation; and then taste or drink some of the same Wort boyled with or without Hops, and you will find that this last hath not only lost its pleasant taste and sweetness, but also its opening penetrating Virtues, by which it becomes of another Nature and Operation; which Fermentation does in some degree help, but it cannot regain those fine, thin, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating Virtues and Spirits, that it hath lost in the boyling, the fierce heat of the fire, being an utter Enemy to all spirituous Drinks, Liquors, or Cordials. It is also to be noted, that unboyled Beer or Ale do generally drink smaller in the Mouth then that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43078:12"/>
which is boyled, because its spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, sweet qualities are not so much destroyed, suffocated, or stagnated by the fiery heat of the fire, as the other, but it most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally warms the Stomach, and not so subject to send Fumes into the Head, and runs quicker thorow the Body, purges more powerfully by Urine, which are naturally Testimonies of its Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and that the better Parts are preserved in the preparation. Also it is further to be considered, That all sorts of Drinks made without fire, altho' with raw, crude Fruits, Apples, Grapes, and the like, as Wine, Syder, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other sorts, are not only more spirituous and brisker in operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but also more cleansing and penetrating, if order and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be observed. But note that all sorts of fermented Drinks are much better and greater preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Health when new, then old
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43078:12"/>
or stale, for Age does naturally consume and turn the mild, soft, sweet, opening, healing Virtues, into a hard, keen property; for this cause all stale Beer, old Wine, and Sider, are far hotter in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration than new, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more prejudicial to Health, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to all such as are naturally subject to the Stone, Gravel, Gout, or Consumption, for it over-heats the Blood, and consumes the Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Moisture; not but that the new Wine, Syder, Beer or Ale, are endued with as great a quantity of Spirits as the old, as is manifest in Distillation: But so long as the mild, sweet, opening Virtues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main intire, strong, and powerful, this harsh fire, keen or sharp Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is thereby moderated, qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or allayed by the sweet Imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of those friendly Virtues; which friendly quality, Age turns into heat, sharpness, and keneness, as is most clearly manifested in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43078:13"/>
firmenting of all sweet Bodies, which no Art can cure or bring back, it being easie by the help of the fiery Art to destroy all the mild, opening, friendly Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of each thing, and turn or transmute them into their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>viz.</hi> into a hot, strong Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but when this is done, there is no further Progress to be made, for it then stands in its original Qualities, and will admit of no cure; therefore it is easie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy, but hard to make alive, especially in all Fire Operations; and remember this, that whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any violence is offered to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, more especially to things that has passed thorough firmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the best and friendly Virtues do first suffer Injury, or Prejudice, which every one ought to understand, first in themselves, and secondly in all other things, more especially in all Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by Fire; therefore such as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43078:13"/>
would drink Beer or Ale more wholsom, may, unless they be too old to learn, and too obstinate to be taught, observe the Rules fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which will make your Drink wholsomer, and save you both trouble and charge; and if neither Profit nor Regard to Health can wean you from the slavery of silly old Custom, your Understandings are certainly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable already, and no wonder if your Bodies prove so in a little time.</p>
            <p>First, Make your Water or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor neer boyling hot, then put just so much into your Mash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tub as will wet your Mault, stir it, and let it stand half an hour, which will dispose the Mault the better to give forth its Virtues and Sweetness into the Liquor; then add your whole quantity of Water or Liquor to your Mault that you purpose to put up the first time, then let it stand one
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43078:14"/>
hour and a half, but if you would have your first Wort very strong then two hours, if the Season be not hot; then put what a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Hops you think conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent into your Receiver, and let your Wort run to them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your Hops have infused an hour and half in your Wort, then strain it off in your Coolers; you have done with your first Wort. Then put upon your Mault your second Liquor near the same Heat as the first, rather cooler if any difference; but this must stand on your Mault but one hour at most; then take what quantity you please of fresh Hops and put into your Receiver as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and let your second Wort run to them; then take both se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wort and Hops together, and put up into your Copper, there let them infuse till your Wort is near boyling, but not boyl; then strain this also into your Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43078:14"/>
which you have done with also. Now if you would inlarge your quantity, which is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which in its due place I shall demonstrate, then put up what quantity you think convenient of cold Water, and let it stand, not more then half an hour, and then run it off to some fresh Hops, and then put this third Wort, and also Hops, into the Copper, as you did the second, and let the Hops infuse till they are near boyling, then strain it off into your Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and you have done; but you must remember that your Liquor or Water do not boyl, for boyling of Water does irritate and evaporate the subtle fine pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating Spirits, whence the more friendly, mild, opening qualities do exist, which do make such Water or Liquor more harsh, hard and fixed, which do render it not so capable to draw forth or extract the sweet virtues of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43078:15"/>
Mault; for boyling of Water does open its Body, and sets the Spirit on the wing; for this cause all Water that hath been boyled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of a colder, harsher, and harder nature then that which hath never been fired, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will not prepare any Foods and Drinks so natural, not to that advantage as that which hath not been boyled. And that you may be convinced of this Truth, boyl a quantity of good River water, and put it into a good clear Vessel, and let it stand a while, and then take a like quantity and put into another Vessel, and let that stand the same time as the other, and you will find the boyled Water to stink, and never be sweet again; but your Water which remains intire, not touched with the Fire, will also stink, or rather firment, but then it will be sweet and good as for any use as before; the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thereof is this, for the Fire
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43078:15"/>
doth force forth and evaporate the essential Spirits and good preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Virtues, which do render of a dead, dull, phlegmatick, gross Nature and Operation, as we have more largely Discoursed in our <hi>Way to Health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is a general Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom to put up hot Liquor a third time on your Mault, or rather Grains, and to let it stand an hour or more, which makes a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill sort of Drink; for the first and second Liquors have extracted or drawn forth all the brisk, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, sweet qualities of the Mault, so that this third hot Liquor hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to work on, or draw forth, but only a gross Substance, stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, harsh, bitter, or keen quality, void of all the seminal or sweet Virtues. Now if there be any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness left in the Mault or Grains, it is weak and fainty, and the gross, fulsom, Martial, Saturnine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties are strong, and have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43078:16"/>
the Ascendant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do in a moment swallow up the fading Virtue, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute it into its own Property; for these fiery qualities do, with open Jaws, devour the friendly Virtues, and turn them into their own Nature, (<hi>viz.</hi>) into a fiery keen quality, a meer <hi>Caput mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum</hi> Phlegm; for all things when they have attained their highest degree, limit, or perfection, do by degrees, as it were, go backwards, and sink towards their Original or Root whence they proceeded.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By what hath been said it appears, and ought to be considered. That the same Beer that is made of the third putting up of the Liquor on the Mault or Grains, is generally pernicious to Health: for as is mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the first and second Liquors, have before drawn forth all or most of the good, sweet, friendly Virtues, and there remains nothing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43078:16"/>
but a dull, heavy, gross Phlegm of a tart, sour Nature, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporates with the Liquor, and is of a very unpleasing taste; and small, and then the common Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom is to take this third Wort, (indeed not fit for Hoggs-wash) and boyl it stoutly with the Dregs of the Hops which hath been boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led several hours before in the first and second Wort, which still doth more increase the Mischief; for the boyling of Hops totally suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, evaporates, and destroys all the volatile Spirits and soft friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Virtues, and there does nothing remain in them after such boyling, but an harsh, bitter, astringent, sour Property, which such small Wort in the boyling draws forth.</p>
            <p>For this cause most small Beer, especially that which is made after Ale or strong Beer, is injurious to Health, and the common drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof does generate various Diseases, but more especially the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43078:17"/>
Scurvy in the Blood; therefore all that do regard their Health, ought to forbear drinking such ill prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Liquors. The best Small, or Table Beer, is to be made by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a large proportion of Liquor to your Mault (according as you would have it) and then mix the first and second Wort equally to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for the Reasons before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, for all Preparations were intended to open the crude Body by firmentation, or some other way, which do not only awaken, and set the fine Spirits and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Virtues on the wing, but also in some degree excite the harsh, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, sour, astringent Properties, but still the balsamick Virtues are most volatile, and readiest to give forth themselves, when commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to a proper <hi>Minstrim,</hi> as appears not only in the Art of Brewing, but also in common Chymistry the Spirits and good Properties gives forth themselves,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43078:17"/>
and runs off first, and afterwards the bitter, astringent, four, harsh ones follows.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The quantity of Hops for Beer, if you propose to keep it half a year, or a year, ought to be six or seven pound to eight Bushels of Mault, and so propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable; but for Beer or Ale that is to be spent presently, two, three, or four to eight Bushels will suffice. Also note, That all sorts of Beer or Ale are best new, and much more agreeable to Nature, as I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before; for the longer any firmented Drinks are kept, the more they tend towards harshness, keneness, and sharpness, and the Saturnine, Martial Properties are thereby advanced, and the mild, friendly qualities debilitated, for which reason all stale Beer does heat the Body, and much more disorder it then new.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Another thing is in a most special manner to be noted,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43078:18"/>
(<hi>viz</hi>) That your Vessels in which you cool your Wort, ought to be well cleansed; and also your Mash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tub (<hi>viz.</hi>) washed well with cold water, which is better than hot; for boyling water does, as it were, fright or drive back into the wood a certain, four, fulsom quality that the former Wort left behind, and which the wood of the Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers had suckt in; for the humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or sweet quality that the wood receives from the Wort, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently turn very sharp, four, and keen, especially in hot Seasons of the Year, so that when the fresh, new, sweet Wort comes into such Coolers, it does most eagerly and powerfully attract and draw forth that lurking keen, sharp, sour quality that the wood had received and retained, which will occasion the whole to become of a sharp quality, which is called (<hi>Pricks,</hi>) but hardly perceivable to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; but when it is firmented, this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43078:18"/>
evil quality gets the Ascendent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole, which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal occasion why Brewers Ale in hot Seasons will not keep above four, five, or six days, or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts. Now the best way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this Evil is, that your Coolers are still washed well in cold water, wherein some bitter Herbs or Seeds are infused 24 hours, as <hi>Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> gathered and dried, as we have taught in our <hi>Way to Health</hi>; and after they are well cleansed with this bitter water, then expose your Vessels to the open Air as much as possible you can, for nothing swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens and cleanseth so much as Air; also avoid putting your Vessels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Cellars, or any close Places where the Air hath not its free influences. The like is to be done in the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your Tun in which you work your Drink in. The like is to be understood in Ovens; for if you bake spicy Foods, as Pies, and the like, and afterwards heat the Oven
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43078:19"/>
for small Bread, such Bread will be tinged, and smell strong of the former things, that is, if the Oven be heat presently; but if the Oven stands open two or three days, in which time those spicy qualities will evaporate; for the Spirits of things are so quick, powerful, and subtile, that they penetrate even the hardest of Bodies, which neither fire nor water can presently extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, but they remain as it were intire and fixed, until a sutable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter be offered, into which, as by Simile, they retreat, and therewith readily incorporate, and therefore remember your Friend the Air; and to prevent this and many other Inconveniences, expose your Vessels to its free Influences; for no Element hath so great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to cleanse, sweeten, and to give true Life to every thing, according to the nature of each, as Air; and where it has its free Circulation and Influence, it destroys all Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trification,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43078:19"/>
Vermine, and evil Scents. But because brewing is become a Trade, and such must brew three or four days in a week, therefore they have not sufficient time to expose their Vessels to this clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Element, as Houswives, and others, that brew only for their own private Families, it will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be convenient for them to Copper, Lead, or Tin their Coolers over, as also the Mash-tub or Tun they firment or work there drink in, but Copper and Tin is best, which will in a great degree pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the souring or pricking of their Ale in Summer, and their Beer will have the same advantage, for the sweet Spirits cannot so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily penetrate those hard Metaline Bodies, nor will so great a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Humidity enter, and that which does will not become sharp, nor sour, as in wood, having no such subject matter to work on.</p>
            <p>It is also to be noted, That your
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43078:20"/>
Wort ought to stand very thin or shallow in your Coolers, for that will preserve it from fretting and growing sharp or keen, if the other Circumstances before-mentioned be observed. Moreover, your Wort ought to be, as it were, quite cold, before it be put together to work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for if it be set together too hot, it will firment so violently, and in a moments time irritate and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the hot, sharp, fiery Spirit, which should not be stirred up, which spends and destroys the pure fine Spirit and sweet Body, and consequently cause your Beer or Ale to grow stale to fast. Nor ought you when your Beer or Ale is in the Tun, to beat your Yest or Balm into it, as the Custom of some Brewers is, especially in and about <hi>London,</hi> which is very preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to Health, and ought to be restrained by some Law; for this beating of the Yest into the drink does so mix, and as it were incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43078:20"/>
them together, and flatten or suffocate the fine penetrating Virtues, that in its firmentation the gross excrementitious Matter cannot seperate from the finer Parts, by which means it does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a strong, gross, and fulsom sweetness, which too many igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant People admire, and count good and nourishing; but in truth such Liquors fail not to fur, foul, and obstruct the Stomach and Passages, sending dark dulling Fumes and Vapors into the Head, and also ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate an hard, gritty quality in People subject to the Stone and Gravel: Also such Drinks are of evil consequence to Women who are of tender Natures, and weaker Spirits and Heats than Men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them refrain the same, if they have any respect to their own and their Childrens Healths.</p>
            <p>The usual Course in brewing, is to let your Drink work in the Tun till it begins to fall or firment more
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43078:21"/>
gently, and then to Tun it up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Casks, which new motion and agitation puts the Drink upon a fresh firmentation, and causes it oftentimes to work again as fierce and eagerly as it did at first, or more, which is apt to make it fret or spend it self, for much or fierce working makes all Drinks to grow keen and stale, sooner then when its firmentation is moderate. It will indeed in such Case become fine somewhat sooner, because the volatile Spirits and sweet Body is wasted, or rather turned into sharpness by the two long and fierce firmentation. Therefore, those that have a mind to avoid this Inconveniency, ought to Tun or put up their Drink young, as the Brewers calls it, that is, before it hath firmented too much, (<hi>viz.</hi>) so soon as your Drink works you ought to Tun it into the Barrels or Vessels, and you need not doubt but it will work sufficiently; nay,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43078:21"/>
you may when your Wort is thorough cold, mix your Yest well with your Wort, and put it into your Vessels presently, and it will do extraordinary well.</p>
            <p>Now if any think that so short a time of Infusion as I have prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed will not get out the Virtue and Goodness of the Hops without boyling of them stoutly, I answer, That all the mild, friendly virtues of Hops lyes as it were outward and ready, which with the least violence are drawn forth, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by that delicate Scent and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor which they cast abroad; nay, so free and tender they are, that if they be not close ram'd or stuffed into Baggs, the very Air shall steal away most of their Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and if so, what will the fierce heat and violent boyling do, which every considerate wise man ought to consider.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Nature of Hops, there is in them a most excellent
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43078:22"/>
glance or friendly opening quality, more especially if they were dried in the Sun, which is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the Host or Kill; for the spirituous parts of this Plant is so nice, that it cannot indure any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heat without prejudice to its fine Virtues, and you might almost as rationally make your Hay that way, which if you should be so dull as not to perceive your folly, I doubt not but your bruit Beasts would upbraid you of indiscretion, and teach you the difference. Hops naturally purges powerfully by Urine, if prepared and used with understanding, so that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly charged to breed the Stone; for, on the contrary, they are a special Remedy against it, if order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with judgment, and as they ought to be; but as every thing consists of Contraries, they may and do occasion the Stone, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diseases by accident; but it is only when they are abused, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43078:22"/>
their good Virtues are drawn off or evaporated by the force of fire, as boyling, and the like, which is done in a trice; for no Herbs that have been dried as they ought, will endure the fire or boyling without manifest prejudice to the best Virtues; but it is a gentle In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion that will naturally, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violence to Nature extract or draw forth all that is desired in Hops, or any other dried or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Herbs; but 'tis true, it will not rouze nor infect your Liquor with their original harsh, bitter, sulsom, keen, hot Properties, which too many, for want of distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Principles of Nature, call Virtue and Strength; indeed Strength and Fierceness it is, but far from Virtue in respect of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bodies, nothing scarce being more inimical and injurious there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, which evil Properties in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing are the more drawn forth and increased by over much
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43078:23"/>
boyling, especially in Herbs and Vegitations which have been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy firmented and digested by the Influences of the Sun and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby the gross phlemy Parts are opened, and the Spirits set upon the wing ready to come forth upon any gentle Summons.</p>
            <p>But the swinging Objection is yet behind; You undertake (cries the professed Brewers, and the good Dames) to teach us to brew, yet have out the principal Verb; you say the Liquor, before it be put to the Mault, must only be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately hot, not boyled: Well, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose we should yield to this, still you forget to tell us, how long it ought to be boyled after 'tis drawn off the Mault: Sure you would not have us brew without boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all, and make raw Ale and Beer, and take 12 or 16 <hi>s. per</hi> Barrel only for a little Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witcht, the Rincings of a parcel of Mault and a few Hops in a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43078:23"/>
little warm Water, with a small doze of Yest to make it bubble in the Barrel, is like to make excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent humming Liquor. You com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of our Ale not keeping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a week; Is it possible (if unboyled) it should keep at all? Nay, can Absurdity call it Beer or Ale? He is like to have Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, who should write over his Sign, <hi>Here's Beer and Ale to be sold that never was boyled.</hi> When the great Fault that all the World finds with the Common Brewers Drink, is, that they do not boyl it half enough; and yet they boyl it double the time as most House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives do. But if you could make good your words, <hi>That good Ale and Beer might be made without boyling away a great quantity of what they put up,</hi> the Company of Brewers might well afford you Five hundred pounds a year for the Invention; for they could save almost as much as their Excise comes to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:43078:24"/>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> This I confess is the common Leiry, but it affects me no more than the buzzing of Flies about my Nose in Autumn. The Objection consists of several Parts, I will endeavour to answer them in order.</p>
            <p>First, As to the boyling of Wort after drawn from the Mault, I do aver that it is not only unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but mischievous, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons before mentioned, and also by what follows. 'Tis not boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but a due firmentation that makes excellent generous Liquor. Wine and Sider are not boyled (at least not commonly) yet few Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple scruples, or think them ever the worse: What's the Reason? because they will say, the Grapes and Apples have passed through as much digestion as they ought, or need to have, by the ripening In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Sun and Elements. Well then, and what's the matter but ripe Barly, which has not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43078:24"/>
received a far higher digestion by the same Sun and Elements, and will thereby remain good and sound several years, which the best Grapes and Apples will not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue good a tenth part of the time; and though it be harder and more tenatious in its kind, has yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone a second by its being made into Mault, and a third af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by our way of Infusion in water, fitted to a due warmth to extract its spirituous Virtues and sweet Body, should need a fourth of boyling so long as you talk of. Is Water (seeing it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally designed by God, and his Hand-maid Nature, the common Drink for all Creatures) of such an ill nature or quality, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires so much boyling? No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly; for boyl a Gallon of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to three quarts, and let the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder stand eight or ten days, and you'l find all its brisk plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness (before to any accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43078:25"/>
or undepraved pallat as relish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as any Liquor whatsoever) wholly lost, so that you, or any Beast, will nautiate to drink it. The Reasons why we heat Water in brewing to such a competent degree, is not so much to correct its Rawness, as they falsly call it, as to qualifie it to open and draw forth and imbibe the good virtues of the Mault, and so likewise of the Hops, which being once effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all our pains in boyling is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, and not only so, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimental too; for henceforwards, if you proceed in your boyling, you do but raise and induce those fierce bitter Spirits in each thing or ingredient, which tho' fitly planted in them by Nature, for their own particular Conversation, were yet never intended for the use of Man, as being injurious to his own Nature when unduly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from the friendly qualities or light of Nature. If then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43078:25"/>
the Water, nor the Mault, nor the Hops require this tedious boyling, why is it practised? Or rather is it not a demonstration, that the same is detrimental; since in all Nature's ways unnecessaries are hurtful, and over-doing there (as well as in Morals) is a badge of Vice. You talk of Rawness, 'tis but raw that is indigested (Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument) but the Drink I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend is not such, since it has pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through all the digestions and firmentations that it ought to do; and if People will not be willing to give 12 or 16 <hi>s. per</hi> Barrel for wholsom Drink, as for unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, I can neither help nor hinder it, any more than perswade an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Irish-man to quit his stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Butter (of as many Colours as the Rain-bow) for wholsom, sweet English Butter, which he counts hath no taste in it; all this is but the effects of Custom. But add further, That this unboyled Drink
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43078:26"/>
will not keep; I answer (bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for all good Intents) then your parboiled Geare. The best way to prove a thing feasible is to do it: Now I have more than once made excellent Beer that never boiled, and yet has kept good, in your sense, a Twelve-month, and he that keeps any longer, has kept it six Months too long. As for what is intended for long Sea Voyages, 'tis a particular business, and so the boyling of it with Hops a great while may, together with exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive salt meats, notably help the Seamen to the Scurvey, and yet both the one and the other might easily be avoided. But still you urge, the only Fault all the world finds with Brewers of common Ale and Beer, that 'tis not boyled half enough, yet, and with as much Judgment, as once an honest Tub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whose Imployment was to carry Beer and Ale from Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses to his Masters, whom I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43078:26"/>
to carry my Ale, who would needs be tasting: <hi>Ay marry Master,</hi> quoth he, <hi>this is good Ale indeed, a man may taste this is well boyled; if Brewers would but boyl theirs so, we should not have such filthy unwholsom Drink in every Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house</hi>; whilst all the while the Ale he drank never boyled one wallop. But if I could make my words good, the Brewers might give me Five hundred pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and get mony by the bargain. I have made good my words, but I dare not undertake to rectifie at once all the debauched Palats and depraved Judgments throughout the Kingdom. If abundance of People will love fulsom Ale, with Yest thwackt into it, to make it as they think strong and mighty, or the rueful Juices of parboyl'd Hops, and will Court the Stone, the Scurvey, the Consumption, and the like, to make work for the Sexton and the Flanel Weavers, I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43078:27"/>
can no more help it then the Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther of above 40000 a year, by the use of that Alamode Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, <hi>Brandy.</hi> And as for a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the Brewers, I am as far from seeking it, or (bless God) from needing it, as (I fear) they will be from following my well intended advice; for it is no new thing for men, over whom Custom and Tradition hath got the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, to act not only against Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but even contrary to their own true Interest to. Much more I could say, but I think this enough for such a Vulgar Objection.</p>
            <p>Here give me leave to tell you, that there are a great number of brave Herbs and Vegitations that will do the business in brewing, as well as Hops, and for many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions much better; for 'tis Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom more than their real Virtues that renders Hops of general Use and Esteem; they are an excellent Herb, and would be much better,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43078:27"/>
if they were or could be dried in the Sun. Some other Herbs I shall here mention, fit to be made use of in Drinks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peny Royal</hi> and <hi>Balm</hi> are noble Herbs, and of excellent use in Beer or Ale; they naturally raise and cheer the drooping Spirits, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and cleanse the Passages after a friendly way, and with a mild Operation. And also they add great strength and fragrancy, and makes brave, well tasted Drink, good to prevent and cure all, or most of those Diseases which the wise Ancients have appropriated that Herb unto. The like is to be understood of <hi>Mint, Tansie, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Broom, Cardias, Centuary, Eye-bright, Betony, Sage, Dande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> and good <hi>Hay</hi>; also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Qualities, and for those Diseases to which they are respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively appropriated. But note, that all and every of these Herbs
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43078:28"/>
ought to be gathered in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seasons, and dry and preserved as we have given Directions in our <hi>Way to Health</hi>; for you ought not to use any Herb or Vegitation in Beer or Ale whilst they are green, except there be a necessity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When you infuse in your Beer or Ale <hi>Wormwood, Broom, Tansey, Cardis,</hi> or any other Herb that exceeds in bitterness, you ought not to let them lye in your Wort above half an hour, or if you put in a good quantity, a quarter of an hour will be enough; for in all such bitter Herbs the Martial and Saturnine harsh Properties are near at hand, and the warw Wort will quickly stir up and awaken their harsh, bitter, strong, astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent qualities, which will present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devour, suffocate, and destroy the fine spirituous Virtues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening cleansing Properties; and then such Drinks becomes of an hard, harsh, constringent Nature,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43078:28"/>
and are apt to obstruct the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and send Fumes into the Head, heating the body and blood too violently; therefore all, or most Infusions of Herbs, made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this common way, more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of bitter Herbs, are naughty and injurious to Health. As for Example; They put a quantity of <hi>Wormwood,</hi> or some other bitter Herb, into their Beer or Ale, at or after it hath done working, and there let it lye infusing (or rather rotting) two, three, four, five, or six Weeks, and in Ale-houses so many Months, until the Cask be out, whereby all the good, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, penetrating, brisk Spirits, and fine Virtues of such Herbs are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally destroyed, and instead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Drink impregnated with their contraries, (<hi>viz.</hi>) with the harsh, bitter, churlish, inimical Properties, especially when such Infusions are made of <hi>Wormwood</hi>; for this reason common <hi>Wormwood</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:43078:29"/>
Beer and Ale does not only hurt, but by degrees weaken the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat of the Stomach, but sends dulling Fumes and Vapors into the Head, and does prejudice the Eyes. 'Tis certain, Infusion of Herbs, if due order be observed, is the best and most profitablest way yet found out to obtain their Virtues, both for common Use and Physick, far beyond Waters and Spirits drawn from them by Distillation, for thereby a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fierce, brimstony Spirit is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, void of all the mild, cleansing, opening Qualities or mild Virtues, which in firmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are turned into a Degree of Anasidity, which fits it, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it capable of Separation. As for Example, Take Sugar (which is the most balsamick and highest sweet of any thing in the World) firmentation will in a little time turn the whole sweet Body into a sour, or a degree of sharpness, then
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43078:29"/>
distil it, and you shall have a hot, burning Spirit, and for every pound of Sugar you will have near a pound of Spirit. Here you see the whole, sweet, pleasant Body is turned into a fierce, strong, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, which has its uses in Physick, but otherwise pernicious if commonly drunk, as too many do. The very same is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in the firmenting and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling of any sorts of Herbs; as in the Spirit of Scurvy-Grass, so much of late cried up for its won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Virtues against the Scurvy, when in truth there is nothing in it; for if you take Scurvy-Grass, and infuse it in Brandy, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Minstrum,</hi> for a certain time, till it firments to such a degree, and then draw it off, or distil it, and instead then of obtaining the friendly, mild, cleansing Virtues, and middle qualities, you have a strong, fiery, brimstony Spirit, which is not so good as rectified
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43078:30"/>
Spirit of Wine, and it hath no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of force to cure or prevent the Scurvy in the Blood, for in good earnest, the frequent use of such Spirits do heat the Blood, obstruct the Stomach, and increase Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Diseases. The greatest Virtues it hath, it being put into Ale, Beer, or Wine, in a Morning fasting, it quickens the Stomach, as Spirits do, and seems to purge by Urine, as most mixed Drinks do, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when Spirits are mixed with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Liquors, but it is the order and Time, and the Liquor it is put into, that is the principal point why it purges by Urine, being generally drunk in a Morning fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the Stomach is free from Food, and the Passages least obstructed, then a Glass or two of any sort of Liquor or Drink will quickly run thorough a man, and purge much more by Urine, then at any other time of the day. And I do affirm, That if any one
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43078:30"/>
take Brandy, or other good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and in a Morning fasting, drop sixty or seventy drops into a Glass of Ale, and fast two or three hours after it, and it shall purge by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and also quicken the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and have as good Effects on the Scurvy as the best distilled Scurvy-Grass, let it either be drawn off with Brandy, or of its self. And also the Mornings draught the good Dame teaches her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to drink, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Ale and Brandy mixed together, which will prove as beneficial. The like is to be understood of other things cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Medicines, if once the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude cries them up, tho' they be never so heterogene and improper, they must do wonders, but leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to their own Humours, I shall proceed to teach you seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good Drinks against the Stone and Gravel, and other Diseases.</p>
            <p>The best Drinks to prevent the Generation, and Cure the Stone
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43078:31"/>
and Gravel, are such Drinks which God and his Handmaid Nature have prepared to our hands, and is ready every where to be had (<hi>viz.</hi>) good River water; for the Stone and Gravel is hardly known in those Countreys where the Natives common Drink is Water, for that of all others is the most friendly, mild, and cleansing: But on the contrary, all firmented spirituous Drinks, let them be as wisely handled as they can, nevertheless they heat the Blood, and a little time does naturally cause them to tend towards heat, sharpness and keneness, which Qualities are great Enemies to the Human Nature, and breaks the Harmony of the Humours, especially in such that are apt in Constitution to generate Gravel or the Stone; also such Drinks causes the Distempers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Heart-burnings, Fevers, and unnatural Heats throughout the whole Body; therefore such as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43078:31"/>
have a mind to preserve their Healths, and be friends to their own Natures, let them follow these Directions, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Of Cold Gruel.</head>
               <p>TAke one spoonful of good Oatmeal, temper it with a little Water, then take a quart of the same cold Water, and brew the mixed Water and Oatmeal well together with the other quart, in two Pots that are for that purpose, and then it is done. Remember that your Oatmeal must be ground. The Oatmeal, if good, will mix or incorporate with the Water. Of this sort you may drink a pint or a quart, or more, at a time: This is a most excellent Drink to be drunk Mornings, and at Meals, or at any time of the day, and season of the Year, for all sorts of People, both for the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43078:32"/>
healthy and unhealthy, especially in hot Seasons, and for such who are subject to the Stone, Gravel, or any other Obstructions of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages; and for young People, the frequent and common use thereof does wonderfully strengthen the whole Body, it is so friendly and homogeneal, that it always quenches Thirst the best of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by refreshing the Spirits, bedewing the Body with a more pleasant and more natural moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, than either Beer, Ale, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or any other firmented Drinks. It begets a natural cheerfulness, extinguisheth all kinds of natural Flushings and Vapors that comes for want of a strong, natural Health, and large Passages. It o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens and frees the Stomach and Passages from gross Matter that obstruct the digestive Faculties, and powerfully purges by Urine, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if a quart or two be drank in a Morning fasting. It mightily
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43078:32"/>
assists Nature in all her Operations; and it is not only profitable against the Stone and Gravel, but also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst griping pains of the Bowels, helps Concoction, disburthening the Stomach of superfluous Juices, and cleanseth the Vessels which are generally stopt and furr'd by Intemperance; and it does natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prevent Fumes and Vapors, by carrying the offending windy Matter into the Bowels, causing it to pass with ease its proper way. Also the common use thereof is an excellent Remedy against short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Breath, or other ill habits of the Stomach, and against all sharp windy Humors and Juices that falls into the Joints. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is a surer and more powerful Remedy against the Scurvy and Dropsie, by opening the Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Liver and Spleen; begets Appetite to admiration, cheers and comforts the Spirits, and is in every repect friendly to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43078:33"/>
Nature, and assists her in all her Operations. And whosoever shall accustom themselves to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent drinking of this cold Gruel, shall find by experience greater benefit than I have here set down. In all cold Seasons you may warm your Water as you commonly do Ale or Beer, to that degree of heat which do rather better it then the contrary. It is also to be noted, that firmentation, not only in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, but also in Herbs and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, do destroy or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute the opening, mild, friendly, cleansing and purging qualities, by which they become of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and operation, for it chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth sweetness into the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of keneness and sharpness, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the Body, and set the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits at liberty or on the wing, as is most manifest in Wort drawn from Mault, which is of an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purging quality, but when fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented or worked, and of ten or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43078:33"/>
fourteen days old, fit to drink, then it is become another thing, for firmentation hath changed or transmuted those soft, mild, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, friendly qualities into a brisk, lively, spiritual Property, tending to heat, sharpness, and keeness. The like is to be understood in the Infusion of all opening Herbs in Wort, or the boyling them in Wort, and firmenting them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, therefore all sorts of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liquors and Infusions are most profitable against the Stone, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and Obstruction of the Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors before they be firmented of all, which our friendly cold Gruel hath the first place; but for such that have been accustomed to Beer, Ale, Wine, and Syder, and are not willing to venter on our friendly Gruel, ought to drink all their firmented Liquors, new Ale a week, Beer twelve or fourteen days, and Syder and Wine new; and if they will use any opening
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43078:34"/>
Seeds or Herbs, then let them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse them in a pint of your Beer, Ale, Syder, or Wine one quarter of an hour before you drink, and warm it a little, so much as you do Ale or Beer when you drink it, which is a commendable way, far better then putting or infusing the Herbs or Seeds in the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, or working of them in the Wort. And you must remember that in all your Infusions that you use, infuse but one Herb or Seed at a time, make no mixtures, least instead of advancing, you quite destroy the natural and simple O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of that from which you expect help, for few men do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the genuine Nature and Operation of two or three seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Herbs or Seeds, when mixed or infused together, much less when four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or twenty are jumbled together, as I have elsewhere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated.</p>

                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:43078:34"/>Those that desire a more friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ale then is generally drunk, may infuse what quantity they please in there warm Wort, as you do Hops: Also use the Herb <hi>Ale-hoof, Fennel Seeds, Caroways,</hi> and <hi>Coriander,</hi> all which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Purges by Urine; but they purge by Urine more powerful when infused in either new Ale or Beer, that is already firmented, as is mentioned before; so you may do it in small quantities, as you have occasion: But if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse those, or any other Herbs in Water, (<hi>viz.</hi>) in cold Water, for ten or twelve hours, and then drink a pint, or what you please, which have a far more powerful Operation against the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Distempers, then in any fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Liquor. It is further to be considered, That strong, stale Beer, Syder, Wine, or any other firmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Liquors, the frequent drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof do not only generate
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43078:35"/>
the Stone and Gravel, but they do as often occasion the Gout, Consumptions, Dropsies, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Diseases, all according to the Nature of each mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and what properly hath got the Ascendant in the Humors of the Body, as is manifest in great Eaters and Drinkers; one man drinks and eats himself into the Gout, another into a Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, another into a Dropsie, or some other Distemper; the evil Effects are as various as their Natures and Constitutions are contrary. Be therefore reconciled to Water, that generous Element which without doubt was, and is the only Drink ordained for all Creatures by our Creator, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that first firmented the Juices of the Grape, and made strong Drink thereof, did drink and was drunk, and therefore was cursed with the greatest of Curses, which ought to be considered by
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43078:35"/>
all wise and good men; but Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is so friendly, and does contain many secret and admirable Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which the Creator hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued this Element with, as in all Ages hath been manifest; for it being pure and clear in its own Nature; and is it not the only, and alone thing, by which all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things are purified, purged and cleansed? And though it be a vulgar Proverb, <hi>As weak as Water,</hi> yet I must tell you, Water is more strong and sublime then most imagine, for it contains a most ravishing and excellent sweet Virtue, whence proceeds the pure, friendly, refreshing quality, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it hath power, by its innate Virtue, to delight and purifie all sorts of Food. Also in Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it is so innocent and friendly, that it dissipates the gross phlemy Body, and preserves the more Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Parts and Virtues, and keeps them living. What shall I say,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43078:36"/>
words cannot declare its excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; it is not only the most plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and truly pleasant of all Drinks, but it supplies Nature with its friendly moisture, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves Thirst beyond all other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors or Juices, it is so simple, and indued with such equality, that it insinuates its mild opening Virtues into all parts of the Body in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible way; it makes no noise, nor causes any tumults in the Brain, nor awakens any inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Body; but it imparts its meek Life as it were in silence; and as Bread hath the first place of all Food, and may justly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Concord, as being the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all good Nourishment, the like is to be understood of Water, that being the Radix of all moist Nourishment, and renders all things fit and profitable for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, of which there are great variety, all according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Salniteral Virtues of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43078:36"/>
Earth it proceeds from; but for general Use, Rain, River, and Spring-water are the best, and that of these sorts that will wash, brew, and perform all Preparations in Houswifery is the best, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that Water that will wash Lining to advantage is the best, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally River-water will do, far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than most Springs, as I have demonstrated in our <hi>Way to Health.</hi>

               <head>Cautions against certain Foods that Generate the Stone and Gravel.</head>
               <p>First, SUch as are naturally sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to these Diseases ought to refrain from all over-salt Fish and Flesh, for such things are not only hard of Concoction, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Passages, but they do
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43078:37"/>
heat the whole Body, and infect the Blood with a salt, sharp, scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick Humour, occasioning Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and evil Juices, obstructing the Passages of the whole Body, and especially the Uriters.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let them refrain all Spicy Foods, for they naturally heat the blood, hurt the natural heat, and produce the same Effects, especially in youth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let them refrain all or most sorts of Food made sweet with Sugar, for the frequent use of such Meats and Drinks do prove very prejudicial to most Peoples health, but more especially to such as are subject to the forementioned Diseases; for over-sweetness in Foods and Drinks, does not only thicken the Blood, and hinder its free Circulation, but it indues it with a watery phlegmatick quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and turns the Humours to the highest degree of souerness, more especially if fats and sweetness be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43078:37"/>
compounded together, as they are for the most part (as the sweetest Wines makes the sharpest Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar) which immediately tends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Putrifaction, whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds various Diseases, according to each mans Constitution and Complexion, <hi>viz.</hi> Scabs, Boyls, Leprosies, Consumptions, Gout, and Stone, all Stoppages of the Breast, ill Digestion, Nautious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, rotten Teeth, offensive Breath, all which Distempers have of late years been more brief and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, since the common eating of sugered Foods and Drinks. And indeed most Mothers and Nurses, through an ignorant fondness, do lay the Foundations for these, and the like Diseases in Children, from their very Infancy, by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued use of sweetned Milks, and other compounded Foods; for Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, tho' it be the King of all Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, and the sublimest Salt the Vegitative Kingdom affords,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43078:38"/>
as being more highly graduated in the almost paradisical quality the Sweet; nevertheless, that too frequent or over-much eating of it proves baneful to Health, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to young People and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for when it comes into the Stomach, and is there firmented, it presently tends to keneness, sharpness, and souerness, which in many People proves of evil Consequence, and does generate a hard gretty Stone, making Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance as it finds Matter capable, and disposed to receive and joyn Forces with it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Also let those that are subject to the forementioned Diseases, forbear as much as in them lies, the frequent eating of fat succulant Foods; for you must note, that all fat Bodies are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so easily dissolvable, neither can the Natural <hi>Minstrum</hi> or Heat of the Stomach, so well digest or make separation thereof, as it
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43078:38"/>
can on Vegitation; neither do such things generate so good Blood, or fine brisk lively Spirits; for this Cause fat Foods lye long in the Stomach, and seem to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie it, not that they afford more or better Nourishment, but the reason thereof is their oyliness, as is manifest in all External Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, for what <hi>Menstrum</hi> will easily separate and dissolve fat oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. The like is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the Stomach; for this Cause a man may eat double the quantity of lean Foods as he can of fat, and yet be more brisk, lightsom, and airy, and sooner an hungry again, especially when u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thereunto. Besides, fat Foods do not only fur the Passages of the Uretors, and generate evil Juices there, but in all or most phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick Constitutions, obstructs the Stomach, causing Coughs, and great increase of Phlegmatick Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whence grosness and fatness in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43078:39"/>
such People does proceed; and the only and most principal Foods to prevent such inconveniences are simple Vegitations.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Improper Mixtures and Compositions are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, as also baked, fryed, and stewed Foods, and not to eat any thing hotter than your Blood, and in Summer let all your Foods be quite cold, only spoon Meats may be eaten as hot as Milk from the Cow; for whatsoever Food is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hot, as the general Custom is, the same is contrary to Nature, and does generate bad Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> makes it hot, sharp, and saltish, which will manifest it self by breaking out in various Spots on the Flesh and Skin, commonly called <hi>Symptoms of the Scurvy</hi>; therefore consider the great and most wonderful work and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Nature in Generation, and making of all Creatures, which is performed by a due heat and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43078:39"/>
moisture, the heat not exceeding that of our well tempered Blood, which we have treated on more fully in our <hi>Way to Health.</hi> The truth of these things, I think, no wise man can deny, the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sensibly demonstrated by the Natives of those Countreys, where they live for the most part on sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Foods, and innocent Drinks, <hi>viz.</hi> Water, which makes them strangers to the Stone, Gout, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and to many other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers that we are most gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally afflicted with; therefore those that would enjoy Health and long Life (which, amongst all wise men, was, and is esteemed a great blessing from the Lord) and prevent and cure themselves of these Diseases, let them, I say, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves to simple Meats, and such Drinks as are before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, <hi>viz.</hi> to eat freely of Bread, Herbs, Gruels, both of Oatmeal and Wheat-flower, and all Foods
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43078:40"/>
made of Vegitations, which are of various sorts, and yet natural and innocent, and every one may by practise learn how to apply them.</p>

               <head>A good Drink against the Stone and other Stoppages.</head>
               <p>TAke good Chalk, infuse it in either River or Spring-water two, three, four, or six days in open Vessels in the Air, this is of excellent use, and very profitable against all stoppages and assid sharp Juices that are subject to gripe the Stomach and Bowels; also it purges by Urine, and brings away Gravel and slimy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive Matter; for Chalk does naturally indue or impregnate the Water with a fine, mild, soft, friendly, or milky quality, very good against Obstructions and sharp sour Juices; it's taste is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and grateful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:43078:40"/>The good Houswife may brew with this Chalky Water to great advantage, for it makes excellent, mild, soft Ale, friendly to Nature. This Water also will wash to great advantage, for it will save them both Labour and Soap. The truth is, Chalk is a brave, noble, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Earth, of a Venerial Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samick Nature and Operation, of admirable use and profit in the Manuring of all cold, stiff, claiey Ground, it is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Lime, for one Manuring with Chalk will continue its Virtues se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years, but the Salniteral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Lime will not hold so long, because in the burning of Lime the violent harsh fire of the Kill does totally destroy the mild, soft, friendly quality, and there does only remain the Original Salt, which is of an hot tart Nature and Operation, drying, and astringent; which qualities are very profitable and useful in several Trades and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43078:41"/>
Arts, especially in refining and making white Sugar, and indeed all sorts of Sugar, it gives it Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Life, causes a Coagulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>But Chalk, being intire and simple, retains a most sweet, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying, mild, friendly Virtue, which also is one of the best things for Manuring Fruit-trees that stand in wet, cold Ground, to render them fruitful.</p>
               <p>So Chalk being powdered, and put into Vinegar or Lime-Juice, it will presently set it into a fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and in a very little time it will allay or drink up the sharpness or assidity thereof, so that it will become almost mild; also being put into the fierce, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding, keen Spirit of Salt, it will in some measure allay its fiery sharpness. Likewise, if the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Chalk be put into hard stale Beer, Syder, or Mum, and stir or brew it together, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43078:41"/>
then let it stand two or three mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and it will presently settle; it will drink new, mild and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, and also very wholsom and palatable, so wonderful is its qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying, friendly, mild nature, and without doubt it does contain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Secrets (the discovering of which is not suitable to this place) what is said being sufficient to insinuate the usefulness thereof, both in Husbandry and House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery, and Physick, in which last Respect, for the preservation of Health, I recommend it to all People, especially to those that are subject by Nature or Accident to those terrible Distempers the Stone and Gout. Furthermore, 'tis a common Experiment when Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are troubled with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, vulgarly called the Heart-burnt, to beat or powder a little Chalk, and put it to Water, and drink it, which gives them ease; but the reason of the Cure
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43078:42"/>
few considers. I conceive that that Distemper does not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly afflict the Heart, as resides about the Orifice of the Stomach, arising from a sharp, keen, sour, burning Humor or Firment, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by Excess and ill Digestion, which seems to inflame those Parts; now the drinking of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which Chalk is infused, does by its mild Balsamick Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, allay or mitigate that short severeness or violence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by gives the Party ease; for if it hath such a power, when only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly infused in stale Beer, Syder, Mum, Wine, of Vinegar and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eager Liquors, 'tis but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to believe it will have no less signal Operation, when taken in a proper quantity inwardly, where the friendly powers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are ready to assist, and help advance to the highest Mergie, for removing and subduing that which before afflicted and oppressed them.</p>

               <head>A good and profitable way for the Poor, and wholsom for the Rich, to make Cherry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, or Drink of Goosber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Currans, Apricocks and Plumbs, being easie and wholsom, pleasant and cheap. There being but one way and manner in the making and operation, therefore one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample will serve for all.</head>
               <p>TAke ripe Cherries, Goose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearies, Plumbs, Currans, or any of the like Fruits, bruise them in a convenient Vessel, then put them in a Tub, such a one as you mash your Mault in when you brew, with a Tap in it, then put what quantity of good Water
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43078:43"/>
(<hi>viz.</hi> cold) as you please, as you would have your Drink, small or strong; let these Cherries infuse twelve, fourteen, sixteen, or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hours, then draw it off, and if it be to keep, infuse some bitter Herbs or Seeds in it three hours; but if it be for present drinking, then <hi>Balm,</hi> or any other good Herb: After this, add to every Gallon two or three pound of Treakle, or two or three pound of Sugar or Hony, but if you would have it very strong, then add more sweetning; then take some Yest or Barm, and put it a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as you do Beer or Ale. The same method you may observe in all other Fruits, as Goosberries, Currans, and the like. This sort of Drink or Wine is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before that which is made of the whole Juice, especially if your Sugar be good; it drinks finer, and is lighter on the Stomach, and more warm, not so apt to send
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43078:43"/>
fumes into the Head, and will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest any sort of Food much better than that which is commonly made.</p>
               <p>There is another way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this sort of Drink, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Take good Water, and make it scalding hot, put it into your Mash-tub to your bruised Fruits, and let them infuse one hour, then draw it off, infuse your Herbs or Seeds in it, if they be bitter half an hour, if not, then an hour, then put it a coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as you do Wort, and then put your Sugar, Treakle, or Hony, what quantity you think fit, or as you would have it in strength, then add some Yest, stir it well together, and it will fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or work, and so barrel it; but cold Water from the Fountain is to be preferred before hot, and is much a brisker Wine.</p>
               <p>These are easie, cheap, familiar ways, and makes most excellent Drink. If your Fruits be of your
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43078:44"/>
own Growth, it will then stand you but in a small matter, very little more than ordinary Beer, and be much stronger. This sort of Drink every poor man may have; and indeed it is a better, and more wholsomer Drink or Wine then the common sort made by pressing; for Water is the Homogenial <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum</hi> in the World, and most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to Human Nature; and by this way of Operation, it mildly and sweetly draws forth all the good Virtues of the Fruit without force and violence, and leaves the harsh, bitter astringency of the Stones and Skins behind, whereas pressing doth by its violence force forth the bitter harshness, both of the Stones and Skins, and is very hurtful, as is clearly seen in Syder and Wine, for the Stones and Skins are of a harsh, bitter astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Nature and Operation; for hard bruising, and violent pressing of tender Fruits, do not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43078:44"/>
and force forth the harshness of the Stones and Skins, but it does as it were suffocate or dismay the fine, lively, spirituous qualities, which your Sense of Tasting will tell you. Taste the Fruit before it be bruised or pressed, and then the Juice that proceedeth from them, the Juice drawn out by our mouth, is fine, brisk, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating; but the Juices pressed out are dull, heavy, and gross to the Palate and Stomach. The same is manifest in the Juices pressed out of green Herbs; for Example, Take what sort, or sorts, of Sallad Herbs, bruise them to mash, then take them and dish them into a Sallad, and they will be so gross, dull, heavy, and fulsom to both Palate and Stomach; but those same Herbs that are dished up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Sallad, which are not bruised, will be moist, pleasant, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Now here you see that this hard bruising and pressing, hath as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43078:45"/>
it were wholly destroyed the brisk lively Virtues, and indeed all that is desirable or delightful both to the Senses, as well as to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
               <p>Note that the forementioned Drinks that are made of Water, Herbs, Fruit, Sugar, Treakle, or Hony, are best with cold Water, as I have told you before, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in hot Countries, for fiered Drinks are no Friends to Nature, except wisely handled; therefore the Natives of those Climates, where they drink Water, are not known to have the Stone, and where their Foods are simple, which all wise men ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Note that all sorts of Syder would keep much better, and be far wholsomer, especially for ancient People, and such are more or less subject to the Stone or Gravel, if when it is new made you infused in part of it, some bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43078:45"/>
Herbs, gathered and prepared as we have taught in our <hi>Way to Health, viz. Wormwood, Hops, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, Centuary, Sage, Betiny, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delion,</hi> or the like, for the bitter quality does naturally hold the sweet Body and Volatile Spirits, as it were, captive, for <hi>Mars</hi> loves <hi>Venus,</hi> also bitterness does migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily withstand and moderate the keen, astringent, hard, harsh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, that they cannot advance nor devour the sweet, mild quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for this cause all bitter Herbs do preserve all sorts of Drinks, and keep them from sharp hardness and astringency, longer then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they would. Besides, they are wholsom, pleasant, and healthful when People are used to them.</p>
               <p>Also good store of such Herbs, whose predominant quality stands in bitterness, ought to be infused in all Drinks made of Sugar, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, Treakle, or Hony, because
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43078:46"/>
such Liquors or Drinks tends to a sharp keneness sooner then Drinks made of Mault, which our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and others, ought to consider that inhabits the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and other hot Climates, where they frequently make various sorts of Drinks with Sugar, Mallas, and Fruits, and where also they are terribly afflicted with the Stone, Gout, and Gravel, <hi>viz.</hi> which all or most Drinks made of Sugar or Mallas are apt to generate; for the highest Sweets, when firmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, either in Liquors, or in the Stomach, quickly tends to the highest sharpness and keen harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, especially in some Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if the sweet quality be not some degrees alaid or captivated by the bitter, which do also mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate or withstand the astringent band.</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX, SHEWING The Natural Causes why Fruit-Trees do so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fail Bearing, and Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Expediments to make Orchards almost constantly fruitful. With a new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of preserving of Eggs sweet and good for several Months.</head>
            <p>HAving in our other Writings occasionally discoursed of Syder, and how advantagiously the same might be made, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to Farmers and poor Country Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43078:47"/>
I shall here take leave to add a few Considerations touching Fruit-Trees.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain, that planting of Orchards, as it is a thing of great Delight, and but of little Labour, and that most Natural and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto the first Commandment of our Creator, so it might be as Profitable an Imployment of Ground as any whatsoever. The only thing, I conceive, that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages many People, is, That Fruit-Trees, especially old planted, seldom brings any considerable Crop; for if they bear full one year, its odds but the next they miss, nay often till the third and fourth year after, they yield not any considerable quantity of Fruit, the Reason of which is commonly attributed to great Frosts, sharp Winds, uncouth Seasons, Blasts, and Blithes from unwholsom Air, and such like External Accidents. But I conceive the true Reason is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43078:48"/>
more natural, constant, and settled, and being once known, might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difficulty be remedied from things known, we by an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Reason, may probably guess at like things, tho' unknown. Now methinks, in the Husbandry of Corn, we have every day Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, very probable to this of Trees, only what is constantly practised in one Case, is not regarded in the other.</p>
            <p>It is a Rule in Husbandry, not to sow one sort of Grain or Corn two, three, or four years on one piece of Ground. For Example; Break up Ground, if it be good, strong, loomy Earth, they will sow Beans; if weaker or light, Oats; after the Beans or Oats, Wheat; after Wheat, Barly; after Barly, Peas or Rye. But if the Land be dunged every year, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every other year, then you may sow Barly or Wheat, Beans or Peas two years together, because the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43078:48"/>
fresh dunging of it does add or strengthen the Salniteral Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Virtues, which was much spent or weakned, or drawn forth by the former years Crop. Nor does any discreet Husbandman expect a good Crop of any Grain, if he sows it several years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the same Field, except he dung it; nor will that do, if he persist in sowing one and the same sort two, three, or four years one after another; for the Dung cannot replenish such Land with a sufficient quantity of that Natural Salniteral Virtue, Fat or Juices that is proper for the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment and Augmentation of the same kind of Grain so often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
            <p>Thus 'tis plain that each sort of Grain (and consequently eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other Vegitation, of what Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies soever it be) does by Simile attract and draw unto its self, out of the Bowels of the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43078:49"/>
Ground wherein they grow, such a particular Nutrative Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or Juice, as is proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for the Nourishment and Propagation of its own Body: And tho' every sort of Corn, and other things, has, and is indued with all the sevenfold Forms and Properties of Nature, yet in each thing there is some one quality or property that is chief, or most predominant, and which does draw from the Earth what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to its self, and so leaves the contigious Ground barren or poor, as to the particular Juice, tho' yet still by a general Salnite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fatness, may be in very good heart, strong and apt to produce Vegitations of another kind, if one and the same Corn be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, it will prove thin, poor, weak, and dwindling, answering neither the Hope nor Charge and Toyl of the Husbandman, but if another Corn (tho' such as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43078:49"/>
requires a richer Mould then the other) be sowed there, it shall flourish; nay, tho' you dung your Land frequently, yet if you sow the same Grain more than one year, if the Season prove not extream kind, such Corn will be apt to fail, and come to little, as often happens near <hi>London,</hi> where they dung their Ground much, because they till it every year, and many times twice a year: So that if Husbandmen should continue one sort of Grain for several years together on the same Land, there would be as great, or greater Scarcity and Want of Corn, as there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be of Apples and other Fruits.</p>
            <p>For what we have observed in the Tilling and Manuring Land for Corn, and the method of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Ground constantly fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by changing the Species of the Grain committed to it, holds
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43078:50"/>
good (as to the former part) in all kind of Fruit-Trees, but the same method (as to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part) for the Remedy cannot be observed in the management of them, as in Land for Corn, and therefore they often miss, and much the oftner for not being so well ordered and manured as they might, and ought to be. In Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry you change your Grain, and often dung your Land, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is in some measure furnisht with a Recruit of every sort of Juice; but Trees cannot be every year or two transplanted out of one Ground into another, nay, scarce at all when they grow big, but are commonly continued thirty, forty, or sixty years, or more, in the self same Place or Ground. Now Trees being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally planted near together (which by the way is a very great Error in planting of Orchards, robbing each other, not only of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43078:50"/>
nourishment from above) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great Bulk and Substance, large Roots and spreading Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they must needs require great store and quantity of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment to support their Life, Growth and Fruit, even much more then most sorts of Earth can administer, for every Tree doth powerfully draw forth of the Earth such a Salniteral Virtue or Juice, as is proper to Maintain and Nourish its own Body, which no Earth can continually afford, except it be much helped by Art; for as we have shewed in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Land for Corn, so the Ground, where Fruit-Trees grow, will in process of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come poor, sour, and hungry, as to the Virtue that is proper for the Nourishment and Support of Trees, and therefore they are not able to bring forth or bear Fruit every year. The very same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43078:51"/>
would happen to Corn, if the Land were not often dunged, limed, or the like, and the Grain changed frequently; therefore the principal Cause why Fruit-Trees do so often blight or miss bearing, is not so much from External cold sharp Airs (tho' they may sometimes do mischief, or at least help forward the evil) as Internally, for want of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Nourishment; for if Land cannot bring forth good Crops for several years, one after another, of the same Corn, (which is inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, as to Substance and Bulk, in respect of Fruit-Trees) how then can it be expected that an Orchard should bear plentifully every year, where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Change, nor Tillage, nor Dunging, it may be for the space of thirty or forty years; and many times the Trees plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too thick, that the Sun Beams
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43078:51"/>
can hardly Influence the Earth. 'Tis true, some Trees will bear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year, others every other, and some every third year, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature of the Earth and Fruit, for that year or two that they bear not, is as it were a Sabbath unto the Earth and Trees; or like Land when it lies fallow, in which time they get heat, and replenish themselves with strength and virtue, which inward virtue does withstand all sharp and pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing keen Airs, that they hurt not; for if the Internal Salniteral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or Radical Moisture be strong, whence all Vegitations hath its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Birth, then there is little or no danger of Outward Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; but on the contrary, when the Inward Oyl and Nourishing Juices are weak and impotent, then every Outward small Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as Frosts, cold sharp Winds, and the like, do take place, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43078:52"/>
help forward the Evil. The like is to be understood in the Human Nature, and Animal Kingdom: If a man be of a crasie, impotent Constitution or Nature, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very cold Air or little Accident will wound his Health; or if any particular Member or Limb be weakned or disordered, that same Part, upon any Outward Heat or Cold, or other Accident, will suck in the Injury, and be easily made more weak and impotent, which does hold good in all things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vegitations or Animals, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature of each; for this Cause it often happens, when we have very warm, mild Springs, little or no Frosts, or sharp Easterly winds, (which of all are esteemed the most pernicious to fruit) that there is but little Fruit the following Summer: On the contrary, other years, when there happens cold North, and North-East
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43078:52"/>
winds, and severe Frosts, great store of most sorts of Fruits, the truth of this every Country man does know; and yet for all this, all their cry is, All our Fruit is blasted in one frosty cold Night, or a sharp Wind, never so much as considering, that other years they have had great store of all sorts of Fruit, and yet far colder and sharper Springs; but most People do in this, as they do by themselves, every Disorder that happens to them, they attribute to outward Cold and Accident that comes that way, and hardly think of the inward Causes, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperances and other Violences they offer to Nature, whence most or all Obstructions does arise and proceed, as we have largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated in our other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
            <p>The truth of what we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared, is further manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43078:53"/>
by this, <hi>viz.</hi> if you cut down an old Orchard, and cleanse the Ground as well as you can from the Roots, and then plant young Trees in the old ones places, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other will thrive, nor come to any Maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but are very Scrubs, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten dye, and come to nothing, at least not thrive, or grow so much in ten years as those in new Ground will in three or four; the chief Reason thereof is, because the Ground in which old Orchards stood, is as it were destitute of, or contain very little of that Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Juices or Salniteral Virtues, that is proper for the Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such Fruit-Trees (since the foregoing Trees) but all new ground, especially such as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Fruit-Trees, does abound, and is impregnated with that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteral Juice and Virtue, as is clear by the thriving and proving of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43078:53"/>
Trees there planted. Moreover, most or all old Orchards, the Boughs, Limbs, and Branches of the Trees are covered with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Moss, of a dry, husky, harsh, astringent Substance, which does arise for want of a proper quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nourishment, that stops the Passages and Pores, hindering the true Circulation of the Radical Moisture, and then the Essential Juices becomes tough, and as it were stagnated, which presently destroys the lively Complexion and Beauty of that thing; and whensoever this happens in Trees, presently a mossy Scurf grows on the Limbs and Boughs, like unto Scurf or a mangy Disease in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; for when the Ground, by the long standing of Trees, grows poor, hungry, and barren, as to the virtue that Trees delight in, then that Nourishment that they do draw forth is not good, neither
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43078:54"/>
doth it generate good Juices, and the Trees begins to Languish and become Consumptive, which is the true Cause of Moss, Cankers, Blithes, and the like; and yet that same Ground, if Manured for other things, as Beans, Peas, and the like, will bear great Crops, for it was rich enough in that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteral quality that was proper and natural for the Nourishment of such Grain, but poor and out of heart in respect of Trees, but if you cut down an old Orchard, and Manure the Ground for vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sorts of Corn, and Dung it as other Land for eight or twelve years (the longer the better) then plant a young Orchard, the Trees will thrive pretty well, for in this time the Earth hath recovered, and strengthened the weak and fading Salniteral virtues proper for Trees, but not so strong and vigorous as that Ground that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43078:54"/>
had Fruit-Trees planted in it. But here some will Object, Why should not Fruit-Trees thrive and bear without manuring and dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as other Trees, <hi>viz.</hi> Oaks, Elms, Hazels, and the like, which will grow in one sort of Ground without any dunging or manuring for, many score years. I Answer; 'Tis to be understood that all such Ground in which Oaks, Hazels, and the like, grow, is principally indued with such a quality as is proper to bring forth and nourish such Trees, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists chiefly thereof, and therefore such Woods will grow naturally there without planting, as well as without manuring. So all good Ground will always bring forth Grass, more or less, as the Season is kind, or the contrary. But our Apples, Pears, and most fort of Wall-fruit, does not so naturally grow in our Climate, any more
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43078:55"/>
then several sorts of our Garden Herbs, which, both Trees and Herbs, are all managed by Art, and great Industry, or else they will dwindle away and come to nothing, tho' Field Herbs are plenty enough naturally, so that every thing must be managed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its kind, and there is no parity between Fruit-Trees and other common Trees, both for the Reason just now given, as especially because the latter does not bare any Annual Crop as the former, but if the Trunk and Branches live and grow it's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, whereas you expect much more from your Orchards, and therefore must be at more pains with it. Sometimes you shall see in the Spring a Tree bravely blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed, and yet at <hi>Autumn</hi> no Fruit; the Reason is commonly ascribed to Blasting or Frosts; but I believe it may most times be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43078:55"/>
to the Cause before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; for in the early Spring the Sun giving every thing vigor, the Soyl made shift to supply the Tree with Radical Moisture e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make that show, but not being able to continue its Recruits, the poor Tree could not perform its Promise, nor Nature accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish its Intentions. But you'l say, What Remedy for all this? Can you shew a Natural way to keep and render Trees capable of bearing every year, or for the most part. I Answer you, and it is thus: Digg three, four, five, or six yards about each Tree, to the Root, carry away most of the Earth, and supply the place with fresh Earth mixed with a little Dung, alike quantity to which you carried away, and this you ought to do every three, four, or five years, or as often as the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dungs his Land for Corn,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43078:56"/>
which will give such Life, Power, and Virtue to your Trees, that you need not much doubt of a Crop every year, or at leastwise it will seldom miss, and your Fruit will be large and fair; but if this be too much trouble and charge, then digg or trench your Orchard, and Dung it well once in two, three, or four years, which may serve indifferent well. The very same management ought to be observed in all sorts of Wall-Fruit-Trees, and others. It is also to be noted, That when you plant Orchards or Walls in poor, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Gravel, or hot Sandy Ground, then you ought to Trench your Ground very deep, and at the bottom to lay store of good black Mould, or Earth mixed with Dung, and then turn in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost or surface of the Earth, and carry away the undermost Gravel or Stony Earth, for that is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43078:56"/>
so hungry, hot, and lean, that if it be mixed with the good Earth, it will, as it were, eat out or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the good Virtues thereof; but if you will not be at the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and charge of digging up, and trenching all your Ground, then digg large deep Holes, and carry away the undermost Gravel, Sand, or Clay, and supply the place with good Earth, or Dung and Earth mixed together, and then plant your Tree in it a proper depth, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> so deep as your Tree did naturally grow, for deeper is injurious to the Plant; and when you have filled your Earth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your Tree, within a little, then put a little good Dung round your Tree near the Surface, and cover it with Earth, which will keep the Roots of your Tree cool in the Summer, and warm in the Winter.</p>
            <p>It is also to be noted, That if
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43078:57"/>
your Ground be hot and sandy, then mix or manure your Trees with good Loom, Dung, and black Earth; if gravelly, hungry Ground, then good Mold and Dung mixed together; if cold, clayie Ground, then mix Chalk and Earth together; which, if this Order be observed, it will mightily advance and cause your Trees, not only to thrive, but bear more and larger Fruit. It is also to be noted, That the old Custom of opening the Earth, and laying bear the Roots of Fruit-Trees in the Winter Season, is an Error in Husbandry, except there be immediately the old Earth ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and the place thereof supplied with good fresh Earth, or Earth and Dung well mixed, such as Trees have never grown in, as is mentioned before, for that Earth that covers the Roots are their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cloathing, which do secure
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43078:57"/>
them from the Injury of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, keeping them warm in the Winter, and cool and moist in the Summer, the Earth being many Degrees warmer in the Winter then the common Air, but in the Summer as many cooler; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the uncovering of the Roots, and exposing them for two or three Months to the cold pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Airs, <hi>viz.</hi> Frost, Snow, Rains, and violent Winds, must needs be unnatural, and consequently prove prejudicial by weakning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Power and Salniteral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of such Trees, rendring them the more uncapable of bearing the following Summer. Consult Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and she will teach you the Truth of what we have here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Will not all Gardeners, when they dig up a small Tree, as Goosberries, Currans, and the like, if they cannot conveniently plant them presently, cover the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43078:58"/>
Root in Earth so deep as they did naturally grow, which are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Trees in comparison of large Fruit-Trees, and most of them will as naturally grow as Weeds.</p>
            <p>Note, That the most natural and proper time for planting most or all Fruit-Trees, is from the middle of <hi>October</hi> to the last of <hi>December,</hi> for by early planting the Earth and the Roots do not only settle well together, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, but the Roots do draw and grow, and thereby they are not only more forward then late planted Trees, but also they will the better indure any hot, dry Season that may happen the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Summer. The same Time or Season is to be observed in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and cutting superfluous Branches, the earlier in the year it is done the better; for every Branch or Limb that is Cut off
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43078:58"/>
from the Body is a certain Wound, and the Tree cannot recover that Injury till it has passed a Spring and Summer; the Truth of this is demonstrated by their not bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so plentifully the following Summer; therefore the earlier they are pruned, the more time they have to recover such Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences; and if you do Cut off any eminent Limb or Branch, then you ought to take the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Earth you use in graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is generally done with good Loomy Earth, mixed with a little Cow-dung tempered well, then cover or plaister the cut Limb or Branch, which will keep the Wound or Place warm, and heal and preserve it from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of a severe Winter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as cold, sharp, pinching Airs, Frost and Winds, penetrating Rottenness and Rankness, and other Distempers that often happens to such wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43078:59"/>
Parts. The like is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the laying of the Roots of Trees open, as is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, and exposing them bare faced to a severe Winter, and Injury of the Elements, as extream Cold, Wet, and Winds, for under the Surface of the Earth the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat is not only greater and stronger, but more constant than the common Air in Winter Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which is varied and changed according as the Eye of the World increases or decreases, and from what quarter of the Heavens the Wind blows; which is further manifested by most or all Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Springs, which in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or hot Seasons, the Waters proceeding out of the Earth, at the Head thereof are many degrees colder than the common Air; or the Waters of other Rivers that runs on the Surface of the Earth; but in Winter, or in cold Seasons,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43078:59"/>
at the Head of the same Springs or Fountains, the Water thereof is as many degrees warmer then either the common Air, or the Waters of Rivers that runs on the Source of the Earth; for this cause, in cold Seasons or in Winter, we can see them send forth Fumes and Vapors, which is chiefly occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Contrarieties of the two Qualities, <hi>viz.</hi> Heat and Cold; not but all or most Fountains, Springs, Rivers, and other Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and also the whole Earth, do continually and at all times, more or less, breathe forth Fumes and Vapors, the degree thereof is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Elements, Season of the Year, and Celestial Influences; though these Vapors and Fumes which the Sun and Celestial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do continually exhale, cannot be seen but only when the Air is colder than the Earth, which cold
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43078:60"/>
keen Air does immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dense those Vapors, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come visible; but when the Earth and Air are of an equal Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then you cannot see those Fumes no more than you can see your own Breath in a warm Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; but you must not conclude that you do not breathe because you do not see it; and it is as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for the Earth and Water to breathe and send forth Fumes and Vapors as for Animals, and they do arise and proceed from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Life of Nature, and are the living Powers of the Elements, for without Motion nothing could subsist, neither could the Earth, Waters, or any of the Elements generate or bring forth any living Creatures, if they had not this natural Motion, there being a continual sympathetical Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Mixion of all Qualities and Elements. But it is to be
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43078:60"/>
noted, That some sorts of Grounds and Waters, and also in some Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Year, those Fumes and Vapors are more plentifully sent forth then in other; as after an hot Summer, in <hi>August, September,</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> the Elements then being moist and full of Humidity, occasioned by the Declination of the Sun, the Days warm, the Nights cold, which do condense those warm Vapors that the Earth and Waters breathes and sends forth: Now these Streams or Breathes, which are nothing else but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Motions of innate Life and Operations of Nature, are better or worse, good, or bad, healthy or unhealthy, according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quality of the Waters, and situation of the Ground, which they proceed from. Now these Steems or Vapors that arises and proceeds from clear Fountains and Springs, or from running Rivers,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43078:61"/>
especially such as have Flux and Reflux, as the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and many others have, are fine, moist, thin, and penetrating, and are powerful openers of Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and great Preservers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and begets Appetite, and are good against Astmatical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers of the Breast, especially if the quality and quantity of Meats and Drinks be carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; but the contrary is to be understood of those Steems and Vapors that arises and proceeds from low boggy Grounds, Pools, standing Waters, and the like, which do agree but with few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, except such as are born and bred in such places; and tho' good Airs are great Preservers of Health, yet Temperance and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath the first place, and ought to be regarded above all other Circumstances, and if that be wanting, other things and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43078:61"/>
signifies little. It is also to be noted, That all Waters do more plentifully breathe forth Steems and Vapors than the Earth, as being more penetrable, thin, and transparent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more capable of receiving the Light and sweet Influences of the Celestial than the Earth, which is a close, firm, compacted, dark Body in comparison of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Water; therefore the Vapors proceeding from the Earth are heavier, duller, and fewer in quantity, but not so thin nor pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating in quality as these from the Water; for this Cause those Persons, whose Imployments are in and about Waters, have for the most part greater Appetites than others, and are more lively, brisk and strong. Therefore it is very good for all People that are afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with shortness of Breath, Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages at the Stomach, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatness,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43078:62"/>
to imploy themselves on Waters, or use themselves to walk by Rivers sides, as much as they can, in all Seasons of the Year, but more especially in Spring and Summer; for those fine, thin, cool, penetrating Vapors, are as it were suckt in on all sides of the Body, which do render those, whose Imployments are abroad, brisk, lively, and healthful, more especially in moderate Seasons, and when the Air and Elements are a little inclinable to Humidity, which do mightily rarifie the Air, and make it more penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and all Men and Beasts are not so subject to heat and drought, and other Indispositions, as in hot, dry Seasons; for heat and drought do not only, as it were, close up the Poors of the Earth, but it thickens and stagnates the Air, consuming the fine, thin, moist, penetrating Vapors and Spirits,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43078:62"/>
making them thick, hot, and sulpherous, and hinders the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Motions and Circulations of the Elements, and their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteral Virtues. Now this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Circulation, and continual Sympathatical Mixtion of the Elements, is further manifested by the Sea, which is the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Element of Water, the Moon being the Governess there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, she having a certain, secret Influence, according to her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, Decrease, and Configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions she hath with the Celestial Bodies; for if there were not a continual Motion in this great Fountain, Tides, Flux and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux, there could be no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture generated; or should there be a Cessation from Motion but a few hours, the whole would immediately become a stinking Lake, and all her Inhabitants would be destroyed; for that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43078:63"/>
which we call Tides, is nothing else but the natural Motion and Circulation that proceeds from the Center or Heart, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals can as well subsist and continue there, being without Motion and Circulation of the Blood, and breathing, as the great Fountains of Waters or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elements, can live or give being to their Children, without Motion and continual Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which arises and proceeds from an innate power of the Elements; for these Elements are the great Body and wonderful Powers of God, and by his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Word and innate Virtue, all things, both in the Animal, Vegitable, and Mineral Kingdoms, have been, and are made, genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and preserved; for the whole Globe of Earth, Water, Fire and Air, are the living Powers of God, in which his holy Word
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43078:63"/>
do continually create and bring to manifestation the hidden My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries and Wonders both of Time and Eternity, to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Praise and Glory, and his Work goes alway on in exact Number, Weight and Measure; for in God, nor in his Handmaid Nature, there is no such thing as standing still or idleness; for should the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> cease from its natural Motion and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, but a few Minutes, the whole <hi>Mundam Sistime</hi> would be ready to sink into Confusion; for standing still, or idleness, have no sympathy either with God or Nature; for the Heavens, Stars, and Elements, with the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and amazing Varieties of Beasts, Fishes, Vegitation and Minerals, wherewith the lower Worlds are indued and furnished, are the living Powers and Works of the Lord, and are still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43078:64"/>
by his Alwise Providence and Divine Word, which is never idle; for Idleness, as is said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is allowed no being, either in the Internal or External Worlds; all in the Beginning was brought into a Being through Labour and Motion, as the Learned <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>The Lord moved himself on the face of the Waters,</hi> and they are still sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this day by the same active and working Power of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. Consider the daily Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Circulations of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestials, <hi>viz.</hi> Sun, Moon, and wonderful Company of Stars, their Rising, Setting, continual Motion, Courses, and various Configurations, and all in exact Order: Behold the Fountains, Springs, and Rivers labouring continually in a long progress to pay their tributary Streams to the Ocean; and the Ocean by
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43078:64"/>
industrious Tides, Flux and Refluxes, striving as it were to supply the Land from its innate or central Power. Do not the great Eye of the World, by a sympathati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Power and universal Motion of all Elements, exhale Moysture from the Fountains of Waters, and bottle it up in the Clouds or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of God till an appointed time, and then Return it with plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Usury, to water and make fat the Earth with the Dew of Heaven? And are not the like Circular Motions and variety of Powers understood in Man? And is not he a little World out of the great? In him is contained the true Nature and Operation of all Elements; and yet, what great Matters can he do or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form without Motion and Action? Are not all these necessary things, that serves for the support and accommodation of Human Life,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43078:65"/>
are not, nor cannot be procured without Labour and Motion? Nay, Life it self cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be maintained, the Blood must always be circulating, the Pulse, Natures Clock, continually stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the Stomach must labour hard in her Kitchin to dress, and prepare, and separate Aliment; for the other Parts, the Lungs be busie in Transpiration, the Heart sending forth Reserves and new Supplies of Spirits to all the Frontier Garisons and remote Limbs of the Body, whilst the Brain is no less solicitous to give the necessary Orders from the Grand Councel, held between the Understanding, the Will, and the Judgment, whereunto Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence every Minute arrives from the five Sally Ports, called the Senses, and all their Results are carefully Registred, and treasured up by the Recorder, Memory;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43078:65"/>
nay, should the hands grow slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish, and neglect the supplying the Stomach with Food, the Mouth would soon be open to upbraid their Laziness; from all which, 'tis a parent, as if writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the Sun-beams, that standing still or idleness hath no Being in God, nor in his Works, but all the Elements, and other numerous Off-springs, do labour with highest Diligence for to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest the wonderful Mysteries of their Beings, which all Mankind ought seriously to consider, and by industrious Courses of Life, in the Ways of Virtue by which he may advance and bring to light the Treasures of his Soul, and good Talants the Lord hath indued him with; Idleness being a greater Evil then most ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines; it breaks the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, and contradicts the whole Course of Nature, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43078:66"/>
is the Mother of Oppression and Violence; a Sin that never goes alone, but attended with a black Train of Vices, always subject to the gross inferiour Powers and evil Demons, which continually prompt him on to commit all kinds of Outrages against God and his Law in Nature, and is the first to all Evils.</p>
            <p>There is a reserved Opinion amongst, not only both ignorant Country-men, but even those that pretend to Learning, That at the latter end of Summer, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Michaelmass,</hi> that the Sap or Essential Virtue in Trees, does fall down or retreat into the Root, and at the return of the Sun in the Spring it ascends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and replenishes the Tree, and all its Branches. But this is a very fond, tho' almost gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Error; for if this were true, the Roots of all Trees would be
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43078:66"/>
be indued with a far greater quantity of Juice or Radical Moisture in the Winter than in the Summer, whereas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is most evident, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is nothing near so much Juice, Moisture, or Sap in the Roots of Trees in the Winter as there is in Summer, or at leastwise not so much manifested. The like is to be understood in the Body and Branches: I refer to any Artist, and let him separate the Parts.</p>
            <p>Besides, there is a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to confute this Error, (<hi>viz.</hi>) If the Sap that is the Radical Moisture or Essential oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Property, whence Life, Growth, Light and good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of all Trees arise, and takes being, should thus descend into the Root, and there inhabit all the cold Winter, then it were impossible that any of the rest
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43078:67"/>
of the Tree should live; for when that Essential Virtue or Sap is withdrawn from any Tree, or part of a Tree, the same will immediately wither, rot and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish; Animals can as well live and subsist without Blood, as a Tree without Sap, or any part thereof, or of this oyley Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture: But most true it is, that at the Declining or Retreat of the Sun, and Approach of Winter, this Essential Oyl or Sap doth every where Retreat into the main Body, or the Root, but absconds it self inwardly in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every Branch or Twig, and when it is strong and vigorous, the cold and fierceness of the Elements cannot hurt it or the Tree; but if it be weak or indisposed, for want of sufficient or due Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment from the Earth in the Summer before, then the Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Season prevails upon it,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43078:67"/>
and extinguishes it, and forthwith such Twigs, Branches, or Tree dies, and no ascending Sap they talk of from the Root can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive it; but if it withstands the Winter rigor by virtue of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Virtue or Radical Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, then as soon as the glorious Eye of the World, and natural Parent of Life, returns towards our Zenith, with his cherishing Beams and sweet Influences, the same is set at Liberty, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens Natures Prisoners; unlocks the Doors, and opens the Passages, and chases away the cold Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine Air, and warms every thing, and makes it Buxom, Jocond and Active, and by simile kindles and awakens all the chill, sleeping, good qualities, and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating its own Virtues, invites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the Sap or oyley Moisture from the Center, and mildly draws it forth to the outermost
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43078:68"/>
Parts and Extremities of every Bough, and so 'tis pusht on to a further Growth, and spruces it self up in Leaves, and Blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms, and Fruits according to its Kind.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Opportunity) adventure to Communicate to the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Notion, which I perswade my self is not commonly known.</p>
            <p>That Eggs are an excellent sort of Food, both by themselves raw, eaten with good Bread, being the best way, and to the greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and also they serve to make up several sorts of Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43078:69"/>
and Dishes, no Body can deny; and great improvement might be made of them by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that go long Voyages to Sea, were it not that they have been told they will not keep. The truth is, we find most of the Eggs that are brought from <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty by that time they arrive here.</p>
            <p>But I must crave leave to say, that it is not the time, but the ill keeping of them that makes them naught, I mean, because they are crowded up in Holes and close Vessels, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from the Air; for I have kept Eggs three, four, or five Months lying open upon a Shelf, or the like, in an open airy Room, and proved as good as if but new laid; and, as I doubt not but any Body may do the like, so I am apt to think, they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43078:69"/>
may hold good at Sea, tho' in hot Climates, if you afford them Air enough, full as long, nay perhaps for six or seven Months, which might easily be done by contriving Wicker Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets with several Stories or Frames one above the other, and open between, on which the Eggs might lye one by one, without danger of breaking, and so might many times be exposed to the brisk Air on the Decks, and at other times set in Cabbins. Thus any Man that loves not Salt; Sea Diet (most apt to breed the Scurvy) may victual himself with two or three hundred of Eggs for a Voyage. Thus Eggs might be brought out of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (not to be sold as now they are cried, Twelve a Groat, when they are good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and you cannot have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove half so many good ones
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43078:70"/>
for that Mony) but at a good Rate, and prove a profitable Commodity. These also, poor House-keepers, might about Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest send into the Country, when Eggs are Twelve a groat, and lay in three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them for all the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as good Husbands do But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Cheese. I am sure, if you let them have Air, they will keep good four, five, or six Months, and probably lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. I shall insist no further on this Matter, the ingenious open Trial will be able to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may not prove of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable advantage to divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
