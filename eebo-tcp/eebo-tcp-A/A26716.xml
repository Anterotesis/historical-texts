         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the following Narrative you have a relation of the bloody
Murther committed by <hi>T. Savage,</hi> with an account of the
wonderful mercies of God to his poor Soul after the commiting
ſo bloody a ſin. To which is added a ſhort relation of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and behaviour of that vile Strumpet <hi>Hannah Blay,</hi> during
the time of her being in <hi>Newgate</hi> to her Execution: which
(though it had nothing in it worthy to be related, yet (ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an inſtrumental cauſe of that <hi>bloody</hi> reſolution, was thought
fit to be inſerted, that ſhe may remain as an example of ſhame
to all lewd women, and a ſevere example of Gods Juſtice upon
ſuch cruel Monſters, who are not content with endangering the
Souls of ſuch ignorant young men (that have not the fear of God
before their eies (with their abominable whoredoms and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
but as it were to make ſure of deſtroying both body
and Soul together, by adding to their former ſins the guilt of
ſhedding innocent blood. And as you have a wonderful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Gods Free-Grace to the Soul of <hi>T. S.</hi> ſo the foulneſs
of his Fact, the danger of damning his Soul, and the twice
ſhameful execution which he ſuffered, may be a means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
all young men and Apprentices from being guilty of the
like fact. And as a help to you herein, you are adviſed to be
careful what company you keep. That you addict not your
ſelves to drinking, or gaming, or company keeping, which is
the ruin of many young men, who by getting a habit of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
company, or other Vices, are very often drawn to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loin
from their Maſters to maintain them in their extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
by which means, they do not only run the hazard of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
their bodies to publick ſhame (if they be diſcovered)
to the great grief, and even heart-breaking of their Friends,
(when they hear of ill courſes) but the wrath of God, and
eternal damnation of their poor Souls, as you may ſee in the
Narrative of <hi>T. S.</hi> who firſt began with Company keeping,
from company keeping to Whoring, from Whoring to Thiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Murther. And laſtly, be careful to ſpend the Lords
day, and all other ſpare time in the ſervice of God, as Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Praying, Hearing the Word Preached, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may
be a means to preſerve thee from the guilt of ſins of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;

            <p>BLood doth cry aloud; the blood of man, when violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhed by cruel hands for private revenge or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,
or the ſatisfaction of ſome ſuch baſe luſt doth cry
as far as from Earth to Heaven for vengeance: And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſome horrible Murders may be ſeeretly plotted, and as
ſecretly effected, yet ſeldom are they long unpuniſhed, even
in this World; for beſides that, ſometimes the guilty-accuſing
conſciences of ſuch perſons who have committed
this hainous crime, do ſo inwardly laſh and torment them,
that they can find no reſt untill they have made diſcovery
of the Fact with their own mouth; there is the all-ſeeing
eye of a ſin-revenging God which doth find them, and a
ſtrange hand of his Providence which doth often follow
them, and entangle them in their steps (when they are
flying, and ſeeking ſome hidden place) which doth as it
were bind them before they are in Chains, and deliver them
before they are aware into the hands of Juſtice to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
            <p>But there is another Blood which doth ſend forth a
louder cry, namely, the Blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
which was ſhed for the ſins of men, which ſpeaketh
better things than the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> crying for mercy
and forgiveneſs: This Blood hath ſuch prevalency and
virtue, that when it is applied by Faith unto the moſt
notorious Malefactor guilty of Blood as well as other
Wickedneſs, it doth out-cry and drown the voice of Blood,
and every other ſin, and waſheth the most impure Soul
died in ſin, unto a Scarlet and Crimſon hue. This Blood
we hope was ſprinkled upon the Conſcience of this Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
who had a little before, embrued his hands in
the blood of his Fellow-ſervant: for having given ſuch
evidences of his ſincere repentance, and true Faith unto
ſeveral of its Miniſters and other Christians that were
with him before, and at his Execution; We hope, though
he were juſtly puniſhed with the firſt death by the hand
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43212:3"/>
of man for his Crime, that through infinite Free Grace and
Chriſt's Blood, he hath eſcaped the ſecond death, and
wrath of God in Hell. The Narrative may give the ſame
ſatisfaction to others which we the publiſhers hereof have
received; which is as followeth.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THomas Savage</hi> born in the Pariſh of <hi>Giles</hi>'s in
the Fields, was put out Apprentice to Mr.
<hi>Collins</hi> Vintner, at the <hi>Ship-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Ratcliff,</hi>
where he lived about the ſpace of one year and
three quarters, in which time he manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to all that knew him, to be a meer Monſter
in Sin; in all that time he never once knew what
it was to hear one whole Sermon, but uſed to go
in at one door, and out at the other, and accounted
them fools that could ſpare ſo much time from
ſin, as two or three hours on a Lords-day, to ſpend
in the Lords Service: He ſpent the Sabbath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
at the Ale-houſe, or rather at a Baſe-houſe
with that vile Strumpet <hi>Hannah Blay,</hi> which was
the cauſe of his ruine; he was by a young man (now
gone to Sea) firſt enticed to go drink there, and
after that he went alone, and now and then uſed
to bring her a Bottle or two of Wine, which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
not her wicked deſires, but ſhe told him, if
he would frequent her houſe, he muſt bring mony
with him; he told her often he could bring none
but his Maſters, and he never wronged his Maſter
of two pence in his life; ſtill ſhe enticed him to
take it privately; he replied, he could not do it,
becauſe the Maid was alwaies at home with him;
Hang her Jade, ſaith this impudent Slut, knock
her brains out, and I will receive the Money. This
ſhe many times ſaid; and that day that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Murder, he was with her in the morning,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43212:3"/>
and ſhe made him drunk with burnt Brandy, and
he wanted one Groat to pay of his reckoning:
ſhe then again perſwaded him to knock the Maid
on the head, and ſhe would receive the mony; he
going home between twelve and one of the clock,
his Maſter ſtanding at the Street-door, did not dare
to go in that way, but climeth over a back-door,
and commeth into a Room where his Fellow-ſervants
were at dinner: O, ſaith the Maid to him,
Sirrah, you have been now at this Bawdy houſe,
you will never leave till you are undone by them:
He was much vexed at her, and while he was at
dinner, the Devil entred ſo ſtrong into him, that
nothing would ſatisfie but he muſt kill her; and
no other way, but with the Hammer: to which
end, when his Maſter was gone with all the reſt of
the Family to Church, leaving only the Maid and
this Boy at home; he goeth into the Bar, fetcheth
the Hammer, and taketh the Bellows in his hand,
and ſitteth down by the fire, and there knocketh
the Bellows with the Hammer: the Maid ſaith to
him, Sure the Boy is Mad; Sirrah, what do you
make this noiſe for? He ſaid nothing, but went
from the Chair, and lay along in the Kitchen win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and knocked with the Hammer there; and on
a ſudden threw the Hammer with ſuch force at the
Maid, that hitting her on the head, ſhe fell down
preſently, ſcreeching out; then taking up the
Hammer three times, and did not dare to ſtrike
her any more: at laſt the Devil was ſo great with
him, that he taketh the Hammer, and ſtriketh her
many blows with all the force he could, and even
rejoyced that he had got the victory over her:
which done, he immediately taketh the Hammer,
and with it ſtrikes at the Cupboard-door in his
Maſter Chamber, which being but ſlit Deal, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43212:4"/>
flew upon, and thence he taketh out a Bag
of Money, and putting it under his Arm under his
Cloak, he went out at a back-dore ſtrait-way to
this baſe houſe again, when he came thither, the
Slut would fain have ſeen what he had under his
Cloak, and knowing what he had done, would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fain have had the Money; he gave her half a
Crown, and away he went without any remorſe
for what he had done; going over a ſtile, he ſat
down to reſt himſelf, and then began to think with
himſelf, Lord, what have I done! and he would
have given ten thouſand Worlds he could have
recalled the blow; after this he was in ſo much
horror, that he went not one ſtep but he thought
every one he met came to take him; he got that
night to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and lay there, telling the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the houſe that he was to go down to <hi>Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end;</hi>
that night he roſe and walked about, and
knew not what to do, Conſcience ſo flew in his
face. The Miſtreſs of the houſe perceiving the
Lad to have Money, and not ſealed up, ſaid, I wiſh
this Lad came by this Money honeſtly; the next
morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he going away towards <hi>Woollidge,</hi> the
Miſtreſs of the houſe could not be ſatisfied, but
ſent for him back, and told him, Sweet heart, I
fear you came not by this Money honeſtly; yes
indeed Miſtreſs (ſaith he) I did, for I am carrying
of it down to <hi>Graveſend</hi> to my Maſter a <hi>Wine-Cooper,</hi>
we live upon <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> and if you
pleaſe to ſend any one to my Miſtreſs, I will leave
the Money with you; ſo there were ſome people
going to <hi>London,</hi> and he writ a Note to ſend to his
Miſtreſs, and he left the Money with the Woman
of the houſe, and went his way, wandering towards
<hi>Woollidge,</hi> and there was in the Ship-yard; about
which time news came to <hi>Greenwich</hi> of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43212:4"/>
that was committed at <hi>Ratcliff</hi> by a youth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his fellow Servant, and that a bag of Money
was taken away; the Miſtreſs of the houſe forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
concluded that ſure it was the ſame youth
that was at her houſe, and that that was the mony;
whereupon ſhe ſent men out preſently to ſeek
him, who found him in an Alehouſe, where he
had called for one pot of Beer, and was laid down
with his head on the Table, and faln aſleep: one
of the men calling him by his name, <hi>Tom,</hi> ſaith he,
did not you live at <hi>Ratcliff?</hi> he ſaid yes; and did
not you Murther your fellow-ſervant? he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it; and you took ſo much mony from your
Maſter? he acknowledged all; then ſaid they, you
muſt go along with us, he ſaid, yes, with all my
heart. So they went forthwith to <hi>Greenwich</hi> to the
houſe where he lay that night, where when he
came, he met his Maſter with ſome friends, and
when his Maſter ſpake to him of it, he was not
much affected at firſt, but after a little while burſt
out into many tears; thence he was conveyed to
the Juſtice at <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> where he fully confeſſed the
Fact again; and by him was committed cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
in the Goal of <hi>Newgate,</hi> where Mr. <hi>H. B.</hi>
(who after ſome acquaintance with him, and this
preceding Narrative from his own mouth) came
to ſee and ſpeak with him, and he ſeemed but
little ſenſible of what he had done: Are you (ſaid
he) the perſon that committed the Murther upon
the Maid at <hi>Ratcliff?</hi> he ſaid yes, O what think
you of your condition? what think you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of your precious Soul? you have by this ſin
not only brought your body to the Grave, but
your Soul to Hell, without infinite mercy: were
you not troubled for the Fact when you did it? not
for the preſent Sir, ſaid he, but ſoon after I was,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43212:5"/>
when I began to think with my ſelf what I had
done. The next time he asked him, whether he
were ſorry for the Fact? He ſaid, wringing his
hands, and ſtriking his breſt, with tears in his eyes,
Yes, Sir, for it cuts me to the heart to think that I
ſhould take away the life of a poor innocent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and that is not all, but for any thing I know,
I have ſent her Soul to Hell. O how can I think to
appear before Gods Bar, when ſhe ſhall ſtand before
me, and ſay, Lord this wretch took away my life,
and gave me not the leaſt ſpace that I might return
to thee: he gave me now no warning at all, Lord.
O then what will become of me?</p>
            <p>Soon after the impriſonment of this <hi>Thomas Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage,</hi>
in <hi>Newgate,</hi> upon the deſire of one of his
Friends, Mr. <hi>R. F.</hi> and <hi>T. V.</hi> went to him in the
Priſon, and had liberty, with much readineſs, from
the Keepers to diſcourſe with him: They asked
him, if he were the perſon that had murthered the
Maid? He anſwered, that he was: they did then
open to him the hainous nature of that ſin, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to ſet it home upon his Conſcience; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him of the expreſs Law of God, <hi>Thou ſhalt not
kill,</hi> and the expreſs threatning, <hi>That whoſoever ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed.</hi> They
ſpake to him of the Law of the Land, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of Death which would certainly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
upon him; that he had but a few Weeks
more to live, and then he would be Tryed, and
Condemned, and Executed: but they told him,
that the puniſhment of Temporal Death was but
ſmall in compariſon with the puniſhment of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Death in Hell, which he had deſerved, and was
expoſed unto. They told him, that ſo ſoon as
Death ſhould make a ſeparation between his Soul
and Body, that his Soul muſt immediately appear
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43212:5"/>
before the dreadful Tribunal of the Sin-revenging
God, and there receive its final doom, and be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſibly
ſentenced to depart from the preſence of
the Lord, in everlaſting fire, if he were found
under the guilt of this or any other ſin. They
asked him if he knew what Hell was? telling him
what a fearful thing it would be for him to fall
into the hands of the living God, how intollerable
the immediate impreſſions of Gods wrath would
be upon his Soul! what horrour and anguiſh he
would there be filled withal! and how he would
be bound up in Chains of darkneſs until the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the great day! and then told him of the
Glorious Appearance of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to
Judgment, that Soul and Body ſhould be then
joyned together, and condemned together, and
puniſhed together, with ſuch exquiſite torments as
never entered into the heart of man to conceive!
declaring the extremity and the eternity of the
Torments of Hell, which were the juſt demerit of
his ſins. Then they asked him, whether he had any
hopes of eſcaping this dreadful puniſhment of hell?
He anſwered that he had. They enquired into the
grounds of his hopes; he told them that he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of his fault, and hoped God would have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
on his Soul. They asked him, whether he
thought his Repentance would procure for him a
Pardon? He knew no other way. They told
him that God was juſt, and his juſtice muſt be
ſatisfied, and there was no way for him to do it,
but by undergoing the eternal torments of Hell,
and did he know no way of ſatisfying Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
beſides, and pacifying his anger that was
kindled againſt him? No, he knew not any; and
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> did he hope to be ſaved? He anſwered, yes.
They <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>quired whether ever he had experience of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43212:6"/>
a gracious change wrought in him. Herein he
could give no account, and yet hoped to be ſaved.
Yes. They told him his hopes were unſound, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no good foundation, and he would find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
diſappointed; that it was not his repentance,
his tears, and prayers (though he ought to uſe
them as means) that would ſave him, if he fixed
the Anchor of his hope upon them. That if he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to be ſaved in the condition which for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
he was in, he would certainly be damned.
That he muſt caſt away all thoſe groundleſs hopes
he had conceived, and endeavour to deſpair in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that being pricked and pained at heart, through
the apprehenſions of the wrath of God ready to fall
upon him, and ſeeing no poſſibility of flying and
and eſcaping, if he looked only to himſelf, he might
cry out, What ſhall I do to be ſaved? and enquire
after a Saviour: and then they ſpake to him of the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the way of Salvation by him,
which before he was ſottiſhly ignorant of, as if he
been brought up in a Countrey of Infidels, and not
of Chriſtians. The words ſpoken to him by theſe
two Miniſters, ſeemed to take little impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, whilſt they were preſent; yet after they
were gone, the Lord did begin to work, and he
did acknowledg to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that two had been with
him (he knew not their names) whoſe words were
like arrows ſhot into his heart, and he did wiſh that
he had thoſe words in writing, eſpecially one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of <hi>T. V.</hi> That he would not be in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
for ten thouſand Worlds, did affect and ſo

The Scriptures were theſe, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 9.
Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the
Kingdom of God?</hi> be not deceived: neither Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caters,
nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Eſſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,

nor abuſers of themſelves with mankind, <hi>ver.
10.</hi> Nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards,
nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, ſhall inherit the
Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>Another Scripture I read to him, was <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19.
Now the works of the fleſh are manifeſt, which
are theſe, Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanneſs, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciviouſneſs,
<hi>ver.</hi> 20. Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred,
Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions,
Hereſies, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. Envyings, Murders, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Revellings, and ſuch like, of the which I tell
you before, as I have alſo told you in time paſt,
that they which do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit
the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>The next Scripture to the ſame purpoſe was <hi>Rev.</hi>
21. 8. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable,
and murderers, and whoremongers, and
ſorcerers, and idolaters, and all lyars, ſhall have
their part in the lake which burneth with fire and
brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</p>
               <p>I told him theſe were the words of the holy, true,
and infallible God; this was the ſentence which
God had paſſed upon him, as the deſert of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
ſins which he was guilty of: for theſe
Scriptures pointed at ſeveral of the ſins which he
confeſſed he had lived in, and had committed, as
Drunkenneſs, Lying, Uncleanneſs, and Murder.
I cryed, you confeſs your ſelf guilty of theſe ſins,
and that God threatneth you with eternal death,
with everlaſting torments, and excluſion from his
Preſence and Kingdom; not only God's Juſtice,
but God's Truth alſo, ſtood betwixt him and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
happineſs; and told him, that I ſpake it with
reverence, that the Holy God muſt be a lyar, or
elſe he dying in the guilt of theſe ſins, muſt be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
and eternally damned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:43212:7"/>
I asked him, what do you think? how will you
eſcape the damnation of Hell, and the great wrath
that is to come? you have heard what God ſaith,
what do you ſay? what courſe will you take, and
what means will you uſe, that you may not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods threatning be caſt among Devils
into eternal devouring flames? to this, at preſent,
he made no reply, but did often ſhake his head,
and lifted up his eyes towards Heaven.</p>
               <p>Next I endeavoured to bring him to a ſight and
ſenſe of the corruption of his nature, and of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of his heart; and told him all thoſe ſins
were in his heart before they were actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
and turned him to the ſaying of Chriſt,
<hi>Matt.</hi> 15. 19. for out of the heart proceed evil
thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Fornications,
Thefts, Falſe-witneſſes, Blaſphemies; and told
him that in his repentance for thoſe ſins, he muſt
not only lay to heart, and be grieved for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
acts, but lament and bewail the inward
principle of corruption, whereby he was ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inclined to ſuch horrid abominations, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the example of <hi>David</hi> after his ſins of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
and Murder, in his confeſſion did follow
them up to the riſe and original from whence they
did ſpring, <hi>Pſal. 51. 5. Behold I was ſhapen in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in ſin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> By this time
I perceived ſome workings of heart within him,
and that he was in ſome meaſure ſenſible of his
loſt eſtate, and by his deportment and carriage, to
be caſt down, not knowing what to do; I was
unwilling to leave him without ſome grounds of
hope that it <hi>may be</hi> he might be ſaved; that there
was a poſſibility that he might obtain pardoning
mercy, and be delivered from that great damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that was due to him for his great tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43212:8"/>
I began to open to him the readineſs of
Chriſt, the fulneſs and ſufficiency of Chriſt to ſave
the greateſt ſinners, and that God (I hoped in
mercy to his Soul) had ſent me one of his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
to offer him a pardon, and eternal life, if
he were but willing to accept of Chriſt upon the
terms of the Goſpel, for his Lord and Saviour, and
did encourage and aſſure him, upon Repentance
and Faith in Chriſt, there was mercy yet for him,
though a Murderer, from theſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſa. 1.
18. Come now and let us reaſon together,</hi> ſaith the Lord,
<hi>though your ſins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as
Snow; and though they be red as Crimſon, they ſhall be
as Wooll.</hi> As I opened to him the great mercy of
God in Chriſt towards Sinners, died in Grain, that
were ſinners of a Scarlet colour, that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
hainous tranſgreſſions, he brake forth into
tears, and wept plentifully at the tidings of mercy
and poſſibility that ſuch a one as he might be ſaved.
Beſides, I turned him to ſome Scripture promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
that God would certainly forgive his ſins, and
ſave his ſoul, if he could repent, and get Faith in
Chriſt, ſuch as, <hi>Prov. 28. 13. He that confeſſeth and
forſaketh his ſin, ſhall find mercy;</hi> and <hi>Iſa. 55. 7. Let
the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will
have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
pardon.</hi> This Scripture he diligently heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and turned it down in his Bible; and theſe two
Scriptures, (the night before he ſuffered) amongſt
others, he alledged as the grounds of his hope of
mercy.</p>
               <p>I alſo gave him ſome Scripture inſtances of
great Sinners that had obtained mercy, turned
him to the example of <hi>Manaſſeh, 2 Chron.</hi> 33. to
that of <hi>Mary Magdalen, Luke</hi> 7. 37, 38. to that of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43212:8"/>
the <hi>Jews, Acts</hi> 2. 37, 38. that were guilty of the
blood of Chriſt, that had murdered the Son of God;
a greater Murther than which could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
and yet upon Repentance and Faith, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them were pardoned and ſaved. To that of
<hi>Paul, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15, 16. ſhewed him how
God had ſet up <hi>Paul</hi> as a pattern of Free-Grace,
towards great ſinners, for the encouragement of
ſuch, that (though guilty of great ſins) afterwards
ſhould believe. To all theſe he hearkened very
carefully, and took notice of the places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for his Meditation after I left him.</p>
               <p>And laſt of all, I endeavoured to ſet before him
Jeſus Chriſt, as the only remedy and Saviour for
his Soul, and ſhewed him the inſufficiency of all
his Duties, Prayers, and Tears, to get off the guilt
of the leaſt ſin; that if he could ſhed a thouſand
tears of blood for any one vain thought, it would
be no better than puddle water to juſtify, or to ſave
him. Much diſcourſe I had with him at this time,
beſides what is here inſerted, and ſeveral other
times when I went to viſit him in <hi>Newgate,</hi> which
I willingly omit, becauſe this book ſhould not ſwell
to too great a bulk.</p>
               <p>After all, I went to Prayer with him; in which
Duty he was much diſſolved into tears; he ſeemed
to me, and his faithful Friend that was moſt with
him above all others, to be very earneſt in Prayer,
and with weeping eyes to beg for Pardon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
grace, and Chriſt to be his Saviour, which
was much inſiſted on in the Prayer that was made
for him.</p>
               <p>After which, adviſing him to conſider of what I
ſaid, for that time I took my leave of him.</p>
               <p>The next time, after this Diſcourſe, that <hi>Mr.
Baker</hi> came to him, he enquired how it was with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43212:9"/>
him: he ſaid, what <hi>T. D.</hi> had ſaid, did very much
ſtartle him, that he knew not what to reply, and
cryed out very much of the hainouſneſs of his ſins,
that he ſhould commit that horrid ſin of Murder;
and knew not what to do, for that left a deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
upon his heart, That God muſt be a Lyar,
or elſe he (in that condition of impenitency) muſt
be damned: yet he laid hold upon that Promiſe that
was unfolded to him, That if a ſinner turned from
his wicked ways, God would abundantly pardon;
and afterwards read on the verſe that followed, <hi>Iſa.
55. 8. For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are
your ways my ways, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Upon which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
ſaid, Men cry out for death and vengeance,
no mercy to be had from Men; but Gods thoughts
to a repenting ſinner were life, for he delighteth
not in the death of a ſinner.</p>
               <p>About four or five days after this, he was puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
about his performing of Duties, and reſting
only upon Chriſt for Salvation; for he was tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if he perform Duties, to reſt upon them; or to
let them alone, and leave them off, if he muſt reſt
only upon Chriſt. At which time <hi>H. B.</hi> coming
to him, enquired how it was with him now? and
how he hoped to be ſaved? He anſwered, By Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Faith; and I could eaſily tell you, to
ſatisfie you, that I do repent, and do believe; but
truly ſo to do as I ought, I find it the hardeſt thing
in the World: I do believe, and I do not; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell how to believe that Chriſt died for ſinners,
ſo as to throw my ſelf wholly and fully upon him,
and to think my Tears and Prayers will do me no
good.</p>
               <p>But here, Reader, we muſt take notice of the
unwearied diligence of the Devil, in uſing all
means, from time to time, to undo, ruine, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43212:9"/>
wound the ſoul of this poor Malefactor, who
would not forbear to ſollicit him to ſin, after he
was caſt into Priſon for former Iniquities he had
committed; for we cannot but judg that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
was loath to loſe ſuch a prey, as his Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
ſoul, when he had brought him to the very
mouth and gates of Hell, to have him ſnatched out
of his hands by the free Grace of God; the Devil
did work the more (becauſe he knew his time to
tempt him was but ſhort) to blemiſh and eclipſe
the gracious work of God upon his heart, and
cloud the glory of God's mercy in ſaving ſuch a
ſinner. He was by ſome former acquaintance viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of him, (who ſhewed their love to a death-deſerving
ſinner, no other way than by calling for
drink, and deſiring him to drink with them,)
overcome therewith, and after ſome former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
of ſin, and his loſt eſtate, did twice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe
into the ſin of drunkenneſs, whereby he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
many to fear that all this while he had no
more than ſome common workings of the ſpirit;
and put us to a ſtand, that we knew not what
would be the iſſue of theſe things; but yet not
daring to omit endeavors (if poſſible) as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
under God, to ſave his ſoul: we did after
this, viſit him again, and again, and ſet forth unto
him the greatneſs of his ſin, that he ſhould ſin yet
more againſt the Lord; and in his affliction and
chains to provoke the Lord to greater wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his ſoul; with many words to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>After which, his ſoul was wounded, his heart
was pierced, he knew not what to do; he asked,
may mercy be had for a backſliding ſinner? to
which were given him ſome Scriptures, where
God called to backſliding ſinners to return, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43212:10"/>
invited them to repent, and promiſed mercy
to them if they did, even after they had done
as wickedly as they could: and this was much
enlarged upon before him from <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 1, to 15.
<hi>verſe.</hi> But God that had begun to awaken and to
rouſe his conſcience, that he might ſet him up as a
pattern of Free-Grace, would not let the Devil go
thus away with his ſoul, but brought him to a
deep ſenſe of his falling into ſin, that he much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
with many tears, the ſadneſs of his ſtate,
the miſery of his Soul, ſaying, what will become
of my ſoul! my Immortal ſoul! I cannot think
what will become of my ſoul! I deſerve Hell ten
thouſand times over, and have I now but one grain
of ſand left in the glaſs to work for eternity! ſhall
I neglect God any longer? O I have neglected
God too long already! ſtriking his hand upon his
breſt, and wringing his hands, and ſhaking his
head, and weeping abundantly, ſaid, Lord, what
ſhall I do? O God, what ſhall I do? Lord, what
will become of me? If God had dealt juſtly with
me, I had now been in Hell, I had been daſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Hell when I murthered that poor innocent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
I wonder that I am not now in Hell; that
ſuch a wretch as I, am not in Hell; God hath been
pleaſed to manifeſt more mercy to me in ſparing
of me, and affording me ſo long time for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tante,
but I have neglected time, and relapſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
drunkenneſs and vain talking, time after time.
I thought this place (meaning the hole in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate)</hi>
a hell upon earth, and did account it a heaven
to be among the other Priſoners; but now God
hath tried me, whether ſin will be bitter and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
to me or not, I have this day (being Lords
day) been among the Priſoners, and they asked
me to play at Cards, but inſtead of complying
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43212:10"/>
with them, I reproved them, and told them for my
part, I had profaned Sabbaths enough already, I
have but a little time to work for my ſoul, and I
ought not to neglect time now; that they likewiſe
(he told them) if they rightly conſidered, had
ſomething elſe to do, and ſtriking his hand upon
his breaſt, with much earneſtneſs he cried out with
tears. Now, now, I find that God hath been at
work, that God hath been at work upon my ſoul;
he hath, I am ſure, been at work, for now I ſee ſo
much evil, and taſt ſuch bitterneſs in ſin, that I
am not ſo much troubled that I am to die, nor ſo
much troubled that I am in danger of hell, as to
think I ſhould ſo diſhonour God, that I ſhould ſo
offend ſo gracious and merciful a God, and ſpurn
againſt all his mercies. Oh my ſoul, my Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
ſoul, I know not what will become of it to all
eternity, it is the grief of my very ſoul that I have
neglected time as I have done, now I ſee ſo much
need of Chriſt, and ſo much preciouſneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
in Chriſt, that if the greateſt King in
the World ſhould come and throw his Crown
at my foot, and tell me I ſhould enjoy it, and all
the glory of it for millions of years, and ſhould
have my liberty preſently, and ſhould ſay, but it
muſt be without Chriſt, I would ſooner chooſe to
die this moment, nay, to be racked to pieces by
ten thouſand deaths, or burn ten years together,
ſo I may have a Chriſt, I ſpeak freely from my
heart, ſo far as I know my heart; and now I find
it is not only the Devils tempting me, hath
brought me to this, but this curſed, wretched, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiſh
heart of mine within. It is within me, ſo
that it was in me before it was committed by me.
I deſerved hell ten thouſand times over before I
committed this horrid ſin; well, now I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43212:11"/>
I will pray as much as I can, and weep, and
wreſtle with God, as if I were to have Heaven for
it; but when I have done all, I will deny all, for
my Prayers and Tears cannot ſave me, and I will
fully and wholly throw my ſelf at the feet of
Chriſt, and if I am damned, I will be damned there;

               <p>About three dayes after, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> coming to him,
asked him how it was with him? He told him
that the Devil was very buſie with him, and did
ſollicite him grievouſly with his temptations, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
him to have thoughts of eſcaping; theſe
things (ſaid he) hindred my minding of God one
part of the day, the other part of the day the Devil
fills me with drowſineſs, that I can neither pray nor
read, nor perform any duty, nor mind any one that
prays with me; ſometimes he tempts me to delay,
telling me that it is time enough for me to think
of Repentance when I am Condemned, and that
God is a merciful God; and ſometimes he tempted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
me to deſpair, telling me that it was impoſſible
that ſo monſtrous a ſinner as I had been ſhould be
ſaved; but bleſſed be God, that he made me to think
that theſe were but the Devils temptations, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I have been ſadly hurried with them for
ſome days; but that which did moſt fill me with
terror, was the frequent fears of the Devils ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
perſonally to me, which did ſo exceedingly
trouble me in Prayer, ſo that I could ſay nothing
when I kneeled down, but was fain to ſet the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
down before me, and durſt not look one way
or other, for fear I ſhould ſee him; and my thoughts
have been ſo vain many times when you have been
reading to me, that I have ſcarce heard a word of

               <head>A Diſcourſe betwixt H. B. and T. S. Priſoner in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,

he had not a ſenſe of his ſin, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>H. B.</hi> asking him how it was with him? he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
It was the grief of my ſoul that I ſhould be
no more affected, I think I have the moſt rocky,
ſtony heart in the World, if ever there was an
heart of Iron, I have one, it is not fit to be called
an heart. To have others come and pray with me,
and inſtruct me, and ſee how they are affected
with my condition, and yet I not at all affected
with my own condition; Oh it is the grief of my
ſoul to ſee it ſo! and yet as ſoon as Miniſters and
good People are gone, and I walk about and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
Oh it melts me, and breaketh my heart in
pieces, to think I can mourn for ſin, and grieve for
ſin no more, when God's people are with me! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it cauſeth them to think that I am not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of my ſin, though, bleſſed be God, I am in
ſome meaſure ſenſible of the evil of my ſins, and
it is the grief of my ſoul to think how I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured
God, and abuſed his Mercy, and ſpurned
againſt his Mercy and Patience.</p>
               <p>After this they both ſpent ſome time in Prayer,
and <hi>H. B.</hi> asked him, how it was with him now?
he ſaid, I find ſo much ſweetneſs in Prayer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I cannot find God loveth me, that to
think I am not Curſing and Swearing as others
are, but be confeſſing my ſin, my very tears tric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
down my cheeks for joy; ſometimes I find
my heart ſo dead and dull in Duty, that I know not
what to ſay in Prayer; at other times I find my
heart ſo full, and ſo much affected in Duty, that I
could wiſh I might never riſe from off my knees.</p>

                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:43212:12"/>
The night before the Seſſions, <hi>H. B.</hi> coming to
him, asked him if it was not terrible to him to
think of appearing before the Bar of Men? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
Methinks when I conſider ſeriouſly of it,
what a light poor thing Mans Bar is in compariſon
of Gods Bar, yet Mans Bar is enough to daunt one,
to hear them ſay; <hi>Take him Jaylor, tie him up:</hi> but
to appear before Gods Bar, who knoweth all the
ſins that ever I committed; he ſaw all my ſecret
ſins, and for God to ſay, <hi>Take him Jaylor, Take him
Devil, ſhut him up in the Dungeon of Hell:</hi> Oh! that
is enough, I believe, to make the ſtouteſt heart in
the World to tremble, for there is no recalling that
ſentence, and I believe there are many go out of
this Priſon, as I ſaw formerly three that went to be
hanged, and they were almoſt drunk, and did
ſing all the way they went, but Oh their note was
ſoon changed; when they came to ſtand before
Gods Bar.</p>
               <p>The morning before he went to the Seſſions,
<hi>H.</hi> B. and the Priſoner ſpent ſome time in Prayer,
the Priſoner in his Prayer did earneſtly beg of God
that he would keep him from thoſe temptations
he might be expoſed unto by bad company; After
this he was taken down to the Seſſions-houſe, but
was not called, becauſe the Jury of <hi>Middleſex</hi> did
not ſit that day.</p>
               <p>At night <hi>H. B.</hi> came to him again, and asking
how it was with him, he anſwered, he found it no
eaſie thing to be a true Chriſtian; I thought before
I came to Priſon, that reading a Chapter now and
then, and ſaying the Lords Prayer and the Creed
at night when I went to bed, would have ſaved me,
though many times I was a ſleep before I had half
done; but now I find it no ſuch eaſie thing to get
to Heaven, nay, I find it the hardeſt thing in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43212:12"/>
world, for my Prayers, and Tears, and Duties, if
I could fall upon my knees, and never riſe off from
them while I live, they would not ſave me, for all
this is but Duty, but now I know there is merit
enough in the Blood of Chriſt to ſave me; and he
did earneſtly beg of God in Prayer, that God would
waſh his ſoul in the Blood of Chriſt and blot out
all his ſins out of the book of his remembrance,
and turn them behind his back; though I as earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly
beg they might be all ſpread before my face,
that I might have a more humble and throughly
broken heart for them; Lord, one drop of that
blood is enough to waſh away all my ſins; and ſo
after ſome conference <hi>H. B.</hi> left him for that night,
who heard from one that was with him that night,
that he ſpent that time moſt in Prayer and Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The ſecond morning in the time of the Seſſions,
Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi> that was a careful Friend for the good
of his Soul, went to the Seſſions-houſe, where he
found him well, and in good frame, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with him for the ſpace of two or three hours
that morning, after which time Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> was
from him to hear the Trial of the perſon that was
arraigned, and afterward executed for the fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the houſe burnt down in <hi>Mincing-Lane,</hi> for the
ſpace of half an hour, or thereabout; in which time,
in company of other Priſoners, he was much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered
with ſomething that he had drank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, which did take from him his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
that he was not his own man, we judge
(that though this did caſt a blemiſh upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
that he had made after he came to <hi>Newgate)</hi>
it was not a voluntary act, but ſome ſurprizal or
deſign of the other upon him; partly becauſe the
quantity was far leſs than what at other times he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43212:13"/>
could drink without any diſturbance to his head.
A Friend alſo heard <hi>Hannah,</hi> the Strumpet, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
him to his former wickedneſs: ſay, others
have made you drunk to day, but <hi>I</hi> will make you
drunk to morrow: But afterwards he was afraid
to drink in their company, but rather denied to
take what was neceſſary for his refreſhment.</p>
               <p>The Priſoners were much againſt his accuſing of
that Harlot, and did much perſwade him to take
ſomething to cheer his ſpirits; and when <hi>T. D.</hi> was
with him on Saturday before he died, he charged
him with this ſin, which had cauſed ſuch a blot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the profeſſion he had made, and what great
cauſe he had to be humbled before God, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to tell him as a dying man, whether it was
his voluntary act and delight in exceſſive drinking,
or no? and he did profeſs that he knew it was not
the quantity that he had drunk, which was not neer
ſo much as at other times he did uſe, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempering
himſelf.</p>
               <p>However, God was pleaſed to make him taſt the
bitterneſs of that cup, in that he had given ſuch
occaſion to ſinners to ſpeak evil of the ways of
himſelf) upon the ſtones cried out; <hi>Oh that I ſhould
offend God!</hi> And though he did much lament the
ſcandal, yet he always ſaid, that he looked not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it as a ſin of Drunkenneſs, but a circumventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
or to uſe his own words, that ſomething was
put into the drink to diſtemper his head.</p>
               <p>On Saturday during the Seſſions, he was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned,
and pleaded <hi>Guilty,</hi> confeſſing, with many
tears, and wringing his hands, that he did, through
the inſtigation of the Devil, and enticement of
that wretched Creature (meaning his Harlot) th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
he had committed that bloody Fact, which was ſuc<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:43212:13"/>
an horror to his Conſcience, that he would not
do it again for ten thouſand Worlds; his carriage
and confeſſion was ſuch, that he much moved the
Honourable Bench and Jury, and moſt of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.</p>
               <p>On Munday next, he received his Sentence of
death, after which time he was with the other
condemned Priſoners, and did pray with them
four times a day, and read to them, and ſung
Pſalms with them. After the execution of the
reſt, he had time given, or procured him by the
Honourable Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> for ſome daies;
which he improved to the great advantage of his
Soul.</p>

               <p>I find, ſaith he, ſo much ſweetneſs, and delight,
and pleaſure in Gods ways, and ſo much folly in
the ways of ſin, that if there were no Heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
nor any Hell to puniſh, I could not but
love the waies of God, and the people of God;
O it is ſo ſweet to be in company with them,
praying and converſing with them, over what is in
hearing others Swear and Curſe, that I account it
as great a mercy as any almoſt, that I may be in
their company; O methinks it is a Heaven to me
to be with Gods Miniſters and People; and Prayer
now is ſo ſweet, that I grudge the time alwaies
when I am off from my knees, or go down to the
Grate: Now there is nothing in the World I prize
like Chriſt, one Chriſt above ten thouſand
Worlds; now I do repent, and I do believe through
mercy, it is the Lord's work, but <hi>I</hi> earneſtly beg

and pray for a more humble, and a more broken
heart, and a more through ſenſe of ſin, and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſorrow for it, and beg that God would enable
me to come to him, to believe in him; Lord, ſaith
he, Faith is thy work, Repentance is thy work, do
thou enable me to repent, nay, thou haſt enabled
me to repent, and I do from the very bottom of
my heart, Lord, as far as I know my own heart:
I repent that I ſhould offend ſo gracious, and ſo
merciful a God as thou art; Lord, and Faith is thy
work; Lord, ſaith he, haſt not thou ſaid, no man
can come to thee except the Father draw him;
draw me O Lord, and I ſhall run to thee, enable me
to believe, Lord, and I ſhall believe; nay, I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
Lord, that Jeſus Chriſt his Blood was not

               </p>
               <p>O my dear Friend, taking me by the hand, come

here is the ſhip, ſaith he, in which I muſt lanch out
into the Ocean of Eternity: and is it not a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing (ſaith he) to ſee ones own Coffin and
Burying cloaths, when at the ſame time I am as
well as you; do you think it would not daunt you,
and to go to the Gallows to have the Halter, and
to die there? were this for the ſake of the Goſpel, I
ſhould not care, were it ten hundred times a worſe
death, but to ſuffer this curſed death for ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
ſins, O this is ſad! why, ſaid I, you have a
greater mercy, in ſome reſpect, than thoſe that die
in their beds, for they are full of ſickneſs and pain,
and cannot ſo well mind repentance as you who
are well, and have nothing elſe to mind. (Ah Sir,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43212:14"/>
ſaith he, their ſins are of a far leſs nature than
mine, and ſo they do not need ſo much repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
as mine do; my dying for ſuch horrid ſins
makes my repentance to be ſo much the more
hard. Oh, ſaith he, I believe it, it is a hard
work to die, I could carry it out as bravely as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
(do you think I could not?) But to conſider
that as I die, and am ſentenced from Gods Bar,
ſo I muſt be for ever, immediately either be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly
happy, or everlaſtingly miſerable: To
conſider this, would make a ſtout heart to tremble;
thoſe poor Creatures that were here the other
night, (meaning the other condemned Priſoners)
they know not what it is to be in an Eternal
ſtate, and if they are gone to Hell, O Lord, how
miſerably are they diſappointed, who hoped for
to have gone to Heaven, and are ſent from thy Bar
to endleſs burning: Lord, what a mercy is it that
I have a little time longer left, let it be improved

               <p>The Laſt Lords-day he lived, he deſired to be

prayer, and in other duties in order to his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for his great change by death, that then he
expected the next day, in which duties he found ſo
much of God, that he had ſome fore-taſts of the
joys of Heaven, and when we asked him what of
God he had found that day, he replyed, that he
had ſuch pleaſure and delight in mourning for
ſin, and praying unto God, that he was loath to
come off from his knees; at night there were
ſome Miniſters that ſate up with him, and ſpent
that night in Prayer with him, and for him, and in
conference; on Munday morning came <hi>T. D.</hi> to
him before day (thinking it was his laſt day, for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43212:15"/>
an order was ſent on <hi>Friday</hi> for his Execution on
<hi>Munday)</hi> and ſaid to him, <hi>Thomas,</hi> how is it with
you now, your laſt day begins to dawn? he ſaid,
bleſſed be God I am not affraid to die, becauſe I
hope I ſhall go to Jeſus Chriſt; after ſome time in
Prayer for him, we deſired him to ſpend ſome
time in that Duty, which he performed with ſo
much affection, and earneſt pleading with God,
that all the company were exceedingly melted,
and their hearts beyond ordinary meaſure warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and raiſed, that the room did ring with ſighs
and groans; and there was ſuch a mighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Spirit poured out upon him, and on
thoſe that joyned with him, that we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the time when ever we had experience
of the like; in which Prayer, after the confeſſion
of his ſins, he begged earneſtly for pardon, and
for an intereſt in Chriſt, ſaying, O Lord, wilt
thou let me die without a Chriſt? ſhall I leave
this World before thou ſmileſt upon my ſoul?
thou haſt promiſed pardon, and mercy, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to thoſe that do repent, and to thoſe that do
believe; Lord, I do repent, I do believe, if I know
my own heart, I do repent, I do believe; Lord, I roll
my ſelf upon thy Son, I caſt my ſelf at his Foot
for mercy; thou wouldſt be juſt if thou doſt
damn me, but thou haſt pardoned others, and it
will be to the Praiſe of thy Free-Grace to pardon
me; Lord, ſhall thoſe Prayers that have been
made, and all thoſe tears that haue been ſhed for
me, and all thoſe inſtructions which have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me, be all in vain? with many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
in that Prayer, which wonderfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
the hearts of thoſe that were with him;
that afterwards we looked upon one another,
wondering at the Grace of God towards him, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43212:15"/>
one ſo wicked all his days; ſo young (being 16.
years old) ſo lately acquainted with the wayes
of God, ſhould have ſuch a ſpirit of prayer pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out upon him: after this he prayed with more
life and fervency then before, and the nearer he
came to his end, the more we perceived God was
ripening him for his glory.</p>
               <p>After this, we took our leave of him, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but that was the laſt day; for the Cart ſtood
below, and the Coffin fetched down, and ſome of
the honourable Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi>'s men, came into
the Priſon; but the Sheriff of <hi>Middleſex</hi> having not
notice to be ready, his Execution was deferred till
Wedneſday following.</p>
               <p>Reader, here take notice, that the report that the
reaſon why he was not Executed on Munday, was
becauſe he was drunk, is an abominable falſhood,
for to our knowledge, that were with him, he did
not eat nor drink that morning. When we went
up to him again, we told him that we perceived he
was not to dye that day, giving him caution, not
to think there was any pardon intended for him:
and one came from the Sheriff to acquaint him
with the reaſon of the delay of his Execution.</p>
               <p>When his Coffin was carried up to him again,
one asked what he thought, and what were the
workings of his heart, when he ſaw his Coffin
brought back, he ſaid, he was much troubled, and
it daunted him to ſee it; for he could willingly
have dyed that day to go to Chriſt. On Munday
in the Afternoon he had an exceſſive pain in his
Teeth (as we judged occaſioned by his leaving off
his cloaths, and putting on ſome thin apparel to
die in;) and that evening he expreſſed great wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
to dye and leave this world, he ſaid, I ſee
and find ſo much excellency in Chriſt, that he is ſo
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43212:16"/>
pure, pure in grace, pure in holineſs, pure in all
things; Lord, I count it an hell to be upon earth,
I ſo long to be where I might enjoy thee: and he
ſpent ſome time in Prayer (notwithſtanding his
pain) with much affection, wherein he ſaid, the
pain of thee Teeth was great, but the pain of Hell
was greater!</p>
               <p>On Tueſday, the day before he died, after ſome
time ſpent in prayer both by him and <hi>H. B.</hi> being
full of joy, he expreſſed himſelf thus; O my dear
friend, what a welcome ſhall I give you when you
come to Heaven; and ſay to you, come, ſee, come,
ſee, this is the glory that you told me of, but all
that you ever told me, was nothing to what I have
found, O what a place is this! O how ſhall we love
one another then! ſure it cannot be, but Heaven
muſt be a glorious place, where God, and Chriſt,
and Angels be.</p>
               <p>The night before he died, a Miniſter came to
<hi>Thomas Savage,</hi> and after other ſerious diſcourſe,
for ſatisfaction of a Chriſtian friend that had ſeen
him before, he demanded of him what were now
the grounds of his hopes of ſalvation? He made
this reply; God both in infinite mercy made me
deeply ſenſible of great ſins, and not only of them,
but of the vileneſs of my heart and nature, and
God hath made me to abhor my ſelf for my ſins,
and I hope truly to repent of them, for that
which hath been the delight of my ſoul, is now as
bad as hell; and God hath given me to ſee, that
all my own prayers and tears, and all the prayers
of all the good people that come to me, are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſave: A Chriſt alone; I throw my ſelf at the
feet of Chriſt for mercy, and if I periſh, I will
periſh there. I feel longings and breathings after
Chriſt, and love him more than my life; I long to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43212:16"/>
be with him, and I would not be to live any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
this world is a little Hell becauſe of ſin; I
fear not death, for I hope the ſting of it is taken
out for me.</p>
               <p>This laſt night before his death, he deſired us to
ſit up with him, in order to his better preparation
for the great work he had to do the next day, that
we might wreſtle with God on his behalf, that
when death approached ſo near unto him, he
might have ſome nearer acceſſes of God into his
ſoul, that when pale death ſtared him in the face,
he might ſee God's ſmiling countenance; which
opportunity we readily embraced, and ſpent the
former part of the night in Prayer, till two of the
clock in the morning; about which time he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
us to go down into the Lodge, that he might
have ſome part of the night for Prayer and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
alone, and to diſcourſe a while with his
friend Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi> to whom he moſt of all did open
his very heart, and ſpake more freely to, than to
any others; (whom for that reaſon we left with him)
and when we were gone down, his friend being
with him, who told us afterwards, he fell into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
and ſaid, What a prodigy am I? What
a wonder of mercy, that God ſhould incline the
hearts of his Miniſters to come and pray with me,
and pour out their ſouls in prayer thus for me?
For me a Murtherer; for me a Drunkard; for me
ſo vile and ſinful? Well, I cannot but love God,
and though I go to Hell, yet I will love God for
his goodneſs and graciouſneſs to me already ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
in this world; yea, though I ſhould be
damned for my ſin, yet I could, and would love
God. What, would they venture to come and
pray with me a Murtherer? How did they know
but I might have murthered ſome of them? Pray
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43212:17"/>
for me! wreſtle for me! well, I know God loves
me; <hi>I</hi> am ſure God loves me.</p>
               <p>When he was in prayer, ſome of us heard him
ſay; Now Lord <hi>I</hi> am coming to thee, thou art
mine, and Chriſt is mine, and what need <hi>I</hi> be afraid
of Death? Lord give me ſome ſenſe, and ſome
ſigne of thy Love, that when my Soul ſhall be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from my body, it might be received into
glory.</p>
               <p>Afterwards when he looked upon his cloaths he
had put on to dye in, ſaid, What! have <hi>I</hi> got on my
dying cloaths? dying cloaths did <hi>I</hi> ſay? they are
my living cloaths, the cloaths out of which <hi>I</hi> ſhall
go into eternal glory, they are the beſt cloaths that
ever <hi>I</hi> put on.</p>
               <p>About four of the clock in the morning we
went up to him again, full of expectations what
he would ſay to us, and what we ſhould hear from
him, and <hi>T. D.</hi> ſtood behind him and took his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
as he ſpoke them, from his own mouth;
and firſt he told us, <hi>I</hi> account it a great mercy that
God hath ſhewed me the evil of ſin, before he caſt
me into Hell, ſin hath not only brought my body
to the grave, but my ſoul in danger of everlaſting
burnings.</p>
               <p>The Lord will have mercy on me <hi>I</hi> hope; <hi>I</hi> am
filled with joy, <hi>I</hi> am no more afraid to dye, than
to ſtand in this place, the Lord make me thankful.
The Lord hath been working on my ſoul; for it
was not <hi>I</hi> that could pray, nor refrain from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
nor delight in any thing that is good; <hi>I</hi>
have cauſe to bleſs God that ever <hi>I</hi> was taken (and
this we have heard him often ſay) for if <hi>I</hi> had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<hi>I</hi> had gone on in my ſin, and might have loſt
my ſoul for ever.</p>
               <p>One asked him which he thought was worſe,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43212:17"/>
hell or ſin? uſing ſome geſture of body, ſaid, hell
is very dreadful, but ſin is worſe than hell, becauſe
ſin brings mens ſouls to hell, and ſin is that which
offendeth God.</p>
               <p>One asked him what he thought of heaven? with
a ſmiling countenance ſaid, heaven! it cannot be, but
heaven muſt be an excellent place, for it is an holy
place. We ſpake to him concerning his Coffin, that
was by him, whether it did not trouble, and amaze
him to have it in his ſight; he replyed, with all my
ſoul I could go into my Coffin; oh it is a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
place. (He ſpake it with joy) I can comfortably
die. I have found ſuch a deal of joy and comfort,
that I would not for a world have been without it.</p>
               <p>We enquired, whether death did not affright him,
morning Light will preſently appear, he anſwered,
death indeed did trouble me, but now not at all, I
long for day, I am not daunted at death. Die! it is
nothing: this life is nothing: but to die eternally,
and to looſe God, and Chriſt, and Heaven, that is
death. Hell torments is not ſo much, as to be ſhut
from the preſence of God. Alas! who would not
die this death to go to Jeſus Chriſt? when my body is
upon the Gibbet, my ſoul ſhall be carried by Angels
into Heaven. My heart is ſo drawn out after God,
that I could leave this world to be with him. This
world is nothing, thoſe that have the pleaſure of it,
they have <hi>nothing.</hi> I deſire to die, becauſe I long to be
with Chriſt, there I ſhall never ſin more; there is no
ſin, but joy, where I ſhall ſing <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> &amp; praiſe to
God. We asked what he thought of the company of
Gods people, for he now had had <hi>experience</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
good and bad. He ſaid, I had rather be here
(meaning the hole in <hi>Newgate)</hi> with bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with ſuch company, than to have the company
of wicked perſons, with the greateſt dainties. It was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43212:18"/>
wicked company that drew me away. I account it
the greateſt mercy, to have the Prayers of Gods
people for me, had I had my deſerts, I had been now
in hell, where I ſhould have had no prayers, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions;
God doth love me, for he hath inclined
the hearts of his People and Miniſters to pray for
me, and their Prayers have prevailed.</p>
               <p>Being asked what promiſes he found to be his
ſupport againſt the guilt of ſin, now he was to die,
he alledged theſe, repeating the words himſelf,
Whoſoever will, let him come and drink of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Life freely; and he that confeſſeth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh
his ſin, ſhall find mercy; &amp; let the wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
his way, &amp; the unrighteous man his thoughts,
and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have
mercy on him, and to our God, for he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
pardon. This word <hi>(abundantly pardon)</hi> did
often refreſh his ſoul; I have ſinned abundantly, but
God will pardon abundantly. After theſe, he
mentioned another, <hi>viz. This is a faithful ſaying, and
worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave
ſinners, of whom I am chief:</hi> &amp; ſaid, I do rely and throw
my ſelf upon Jeſus Chriſt, I do believe there is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
enough in him, and all-ſufficiency in him to ſave
me; It is nothing that I can do, will ſave me.</p>
               <p>He complained, that it was the grief of his ſoul,
that he could love God no more, and love Chriſt no
more for his mercy towards him, in giving him ſo
much time, &amp; ſo many helps, in ſending ſo many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
to inſtruct him, but added, when ſeveral Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
had been with me, I threw off all, &amp; returned
to ſin, &amp; did as vainly as any. I could not have repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and believed of my ſelf, it is the work of God.
He often ſaid, I fear not death, it was nothing with
him to die, &amp; to go to Chriſt. He often ſaid, that he
had rather die imediatly, having an intereſt in Chriſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43212:18"/>
than to live a thouſand years in this world, in the
enjoyment of all the pleaſures of it, without Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And, that he had found more pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the ways of God, ſince he came into Priſon,
than ever he found in all the ways of ſin.</p>
               <p>He confeſſed his ſins, ſaying, he firſt neglected
and profaned the Sabbath, and ſaid this was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnig
of all his wickedneſs, that on the Sabbath
morning, he ſtudied what company to go into, in
what place of ſin he might ſpend the Sabbath, then
to wicked Society, then to Ale-houſes, then to Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel-houſes,
then to murder, then to theft, then to
<hi>Newgate,</hi> and yet at laſt he hoped to Heaven.</p>
               <p>He lamented, ſaying, I have ſtriven to diſhonour
God, and to run into ſin: Oh that I ſhould ſpend ſo
much time in ſerving of the Devil, and now have
but a little moment of time to ſpend in the ſervice
of God, and to the glory of God.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe being ended, we deſired him now
on his laſt morning before he went into eternity,
to pray with us, and he willingly conſented, and
his prayer was as followeth, being taken from his
mouth by <hi>Thomas Doolittel,</hi> that alſo took in writing
his preceding diſcourſe; <hi>Verbatim.</hi>

have deſerved to be caſt into Torments to all Eternity.
How have I offended thee, and run on in ſin, and thought
I could never do enough to abuſe thy mercy! Pardon

ſin, O Lord, let the blood of Chriſt cry more for mercy,
than the blood of that Creature cry for Vengeance. O
Lord, thou haſt been merciful to me in giving me time
to repent, for ought I know, her Soul is undone for ever,
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me, I knew not what
I did. Forgive my Sabbath-breaking, lying, curſing,
forgive my drunkenneſs, blot them out of the book of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
turn them away behind thee. Lord I have
repented of them from my Soul, that ever I ſhould offend
God, ſo good, and ſo merciful and gracious, I do believe
on thee, and do wholly throw my ſelf upon thee. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it would be just in thee to damn my Soul,
but it will be infinite mercy in thee to ſave me, and
what free grace will it be in the to pardon me. It is
dreadful to loſe the body, but how dreadful will it be to
loſe the Soul to all eternity! Lord let it not be in vain
that I have had ſo many inſtructions, O let me not go
down to Hell, let my Soul bleſs and praiſe thy Name for
ever, for what thou haſt done for me, thou haſt been at
work upon my heart, and thou haſt helped me to repent,
the Lord be praiſed. Lord I deſire to be more and more

there are many Souls that have not committed
thoſe ſins that are now in Hell. O what mercy is it that
I am not in thoſe flames, in thoſe devouring flames!
Lord as thou haſt ſpared me here, ſpare me to Eternity.
Let not my Soul periſh, Lord reveal thy ſelf unto me,
make known thy love unto me, tell me my ſins are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
tell me, that I have an interest in Chriſt before
I go hence, and be ſeen no more, that I might leave ſome
teſtimony behind me, that I might tell thy Ministers,
what thou haſt done for me, and tell thy people what
thou haſt done for my ſoul; Lord this will not be only

pardon the ſins that I am guilty of, and take away this

to thee, and take away this heart of ſtone, and take away
this curſed nature; for it was this curſed nature that
brought me to theſe ſins, and to this end, and I was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of loſing my ſoul to all eternity; but, Lord, though
I am a great ſinner, Chriſt is a great Saviour, He is able
to ſave me from my ſins, though they be never ſo great;
I do believe, Lord, I ſpeak freely from my heart, ſo far
as I know my heart, I do believe, it is my grief I can ſorrow
no more for my ſins, which have been the cauſe of my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
thee ſo long, and ſo much. One drop of thy
Blood ſprinkled upon my ſoul, will pardon all my ſins;
Lord, croſs the black line of my ſins with the red line of
thy Blood: I am not able to anſwer for one vain thought,
much leſs for all my horrid crimes. Lord, ſave my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
ſoul, that I might ſing praiſe to Thee to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Thou haſt pardoned <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> that was a great

God had no more mercy on her ſoul, than I had of

deſerve not only death from men, but damnation

take warning by me; the firſt ſin I began with, was
Sabbath-breaking, thereby I got acquainted with

the Ale-houſe to the Bawdy-houſe, there I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded

inſomuch as one ſaid to another friend of his,
namely Mr. <hi>B.</hi> now he is in Eternity, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
beginning to move away, the Sheriff comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to be cut down, and being received in the
arms of ſome of his Friends, he was conveyed by
them into a houſe not far diſtant from the place of
Execution, where being laid upon a Table, unto
the aſtoniſhment of the Beholders, he began to ſtir
and breath, and rattle in his throat, and it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
his life was whole in him; from the Table he
was carried to a bed in the ſame houſe, where he
breathed more ſtrongly, and opened his eyes, and
his mouth (though his teeth were ſet before) and
offered to ſpeak, but could not recover the uſe
of his tongue; but his reviving being known, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
4 hours the Officers came to the houſe where he
was, and conveyed him to the place of Execution
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43212:22"/>
again, and hung him up again, until he was quite
dead, whence he was carried by his mourning
friends to <hi>Iſlington,</hi> where he now ſleepeth in the
bed of his Grave, until the morning of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
from whence, though buried in diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
he will then be raiſed in glory.</p>
               <p>Thus you have had the Relation of one that was
but young in years, but old in wickedneſs: you have
read of his Sabbath-breaking, Profaneneſs, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Lying, Stealing, Drunkenneſs, Fornication,
and the like ſins, which he confeſſed himſelf fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and deeply guilty of; and to compleat and
fill up the meaſure of his ſins, he added to the reſt
the horrid ſin of Murder. I believe you have ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
heard of ſin grown up to ſuch maturity in ſo
ſhort a time, as it did in him, who when he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
was under ſixteen years of age.</p>
               <p>And what could any expect ſhould be the iſſue &amp;
product of ſin arrived to ſuch perfection, but death,
and wrath, and the vengeance of Eternal Fire?</p>
               <p>But behold here an inſtance of Free Grace! his
ſins did abound, but Gods grace did ſuper-abound.
Sometimes God doth ſow the ſeed of Grace in the
heart that is moſt unlikely to receive it, &amp; reapeth
<hi>Great Glory</hi> to his name by pardoning <hi>Great Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read that when <hi>Ephraim</hi> was bent upon wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
ſo that a man could hardly expect the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
of Gods anger any longer, but that it
ſhould kindle in his breaſt, &amp; break forth in a flame
to devour a people ſo rebellious, yet the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
himſelf in a way of wonderful mercy, and
aſtoniſhing free Grace, <hi>Hoſ. 11. 8, 9. How ſhall I give
thee up O</hi> Ephraim? <hi>how ſhall I make thee as</hi> Admah?
<hi>how ſhall I ſet thee as</hi> Zeboim? <hi>my heart is turned
within me</hi> (not againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but towards him)
<hi>my repentings</hi> (not mine anger) <hi>are kindled together,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43212:23"/>
I will not execute the fierceneſs of mine anger.</hi> And
the reaſon is not drawn from any thing in <hi>Ephraim</hi>
to move him, but only from himſelf, <hi>for I am God, &amp;
not man.</hi> If one man had been ſo provoked by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp; it had lain in the power of his hand to have
avenged himſelf upon his enemy, ſurely he would
not have ſpared, or ſhewn any favour; but becauſe
he is God &amp; not man, whoſe thoughts are not like
our thoughts, and whoſe mercies are not like our
mercies, but further removed above them, than the
Heavens are removed above the Earth; in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with whoſe mercies, our moſt tender mercies
are no leſs than cruelty: therefore, becauſe he is
God &amp; not man, and herein would Act like himſelf,
he hath pity, &amp; ſheweth favour unto <hi>Ephraim.</hi> Take
another inſtance in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had made God to
ſerve with his ſins, and wearied him with his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
having preſſed God herewith as a cart is preſſed
with ſheaves, and nothing but vengeance could ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
be expected, &amp; that God ſhould ſay as at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
time (for God doth not ſhew ſuch favor to
all, &amp; at all times, that the freeneſs of it might be
the more evident;) <hi>Ah, I will eaſe me of my Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and avenge me on my Enemies; and I, even I am he
that will make ſuch audacious ſinners ſee and feel what
an evil and fearful thing it is to affront and provoke me;</hi>
yet read how graciouſly God pardoneth <hi>Iſrael,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the ground of it to be only for the glory
of his own Name, <hi>Iſa. 43. 25. I, even I am he that
blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and will
not remember thy ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely no motive from this young mans perſon, or
any good previus diſpoſition (he being ſo exceeding
vitiated by ſuch defiling ſins) could in the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
God to have mercy upon him; but the motive
was taken from himſelf, &amp; his own bowels. He had
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43212:23"/>
mercy on him only, becauſe he would have mercy,
&amp; compaſſion on him, becauſe he would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.
If ſome, yea many are paſſed by, who have
eſcaped the more groſs pollutions which are in the
world through luſt, &amp; never committed ſuch God-provoking
ſins, as you read in the Narrative that he
committed; but for leſſer faults are puniſhed ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly,
when God hath had mercy upon him, and
thrown the skirt of his love over him, and wrought
a gracious change in him; we muſt ſay with our
Saviour, <hi>Matth. 11. 26. Even ſo Father, becauſe it ſo
ſeemed good in thy ſight!</hi> It is through free grace that
any are ſaved; but in the ſalvation of ſuch a one,
God hath demonſtrated the exceeding riches of his
grace towards him through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
               <p>Let not any from this example of Gods free grace
preſume to continue &amp; indulge themſelves in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
courſe, hoping to obtain mercy at the laſt as he
hath done, and to turn Gods glory into ſhame, &amp; his
grace into wantonneſs: for it is a rare example,
hardly again to be parallel'd: will a man run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
through the body, becauſe ſome have been
healed of ſuch wounds? will a man drink down
poyſon, becauſe ſome by an Antidote have expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the poyſon and eſcaped with life? Is not
preſumption the bane and ruin of millions of ſouls?
may not God cut you off in the act of ſome of your
ſins, and not give you time for repentance? and if
life doth continue, may not he deny you the grace
of Repentance? doth not cuſtome and continuance
in ſin harden your heart, and faſten you in Satans
Chains? hath not God threatened that ſuch who
cry peace, peace to themſelves, though they walk
after the imagination of their hearts, to add
drunkenneſs to thirſt, That he will not ſpare them,
but his anger and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoke againſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43212:24"/>
them, and that he will blot out their name from
under Heaven, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>The great Improvement which ſhould be made
of Gods gracious dealings with this young man, is
for all to admire Gods free grace; and eſpecially for
poor diſtreſſed Souls, that are upon the brink
of Hell in their own apprehenſions, and are ready
to deſpair of Gods mercy, becauſe of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their ſins; to take encouragement from
hence, and hopes, that there may be mercy in
ſtore for them; they have not been Murderers,
whatever their ſins have been, and if a Murderer
hath been received into favour, why may not they
hope? Let ſuch think with themſelves that it is
free grace hath ſaved him, and let them ſue out at
the throne of Grace, for the ſame grace which is
freely tendred unto them.</p>
               <p>A recollection out of this Narrative of thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
from which in charity we do conclude,
that the work of grace was really wrought in his
ſoul; or the evidences of <hi>T. S.</hi> of his Title to
Eternal Happineſs.</p>
               <p>1. HE bitterly lamented his ſins, and loathed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for them, eſpecially as they were againſt a
good and gracious God, according to <hi>Pſ. 51. 4. and</hi> Luc.
15. 18. (2) He was deeply ſenſible of, and grieved for,
the corruption of his heart, from whence his actual ſins
did proceed, according to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. (3) He mourned
over his back-ſlidings, becauſe God was thereby diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.
(4) He found it hard to believe, yet profeſſed he
would roll himſelf, and rely upon the merits of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
for Salvation, and if he periſhed, he would periſh
there. (5) He was much in a little time in duty, yet did
proteſt he ſaw the inſufficiency of them to juſtifie
or
ſave him, according to <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. (6) He made choice of
Chriſt before all, before life it ſelf, according to <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43212:24"/>
(7.) he longed for morning when he was to die, becauſe
he deſired to be with Chriſt, according to <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. (8)
he greatly loved God, becauſe much was forgiven him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 47. and ſaid, though God ſhould
damn him, yet he could and would love God. (9) he loved
the company of Gods people, and profeſſed, he had rather
be with Gods people in priſon, with bread and water, than
with the ungodly with liberty and greateſt dainties, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. (10.) he bleſſed God that ever he
was taken and impriſoned; thinking it better to be in
chains, and brought to die, than to go on in ſin. (11) he
was moſt broken and melted for his ſins, when thoſe that
came to viſit him were gone from him, and not in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
when hypocrites mourn before others, and are leſs
affected when alone; yet this was ſometimes his trouble,
leſt God ſhould loſe the glory of the work he had wrought
in him. This was obſerved by one that was uſually with
him, when others went from him. (12) he wept for joy at
that time, when he could not find that God loved him;
that he was not curſing, and ſwearing, and ſinning againſt
God, as others did, and he himſelf formerly. (13) he
found and taſted more ſweetneſs in the waies of God, in
praying, and mourning for ſin, than he ever found in the
commiſſion of ſin. (14) he accounted ſin to be worſe than
hell. (15) he had a ſpirit of Prayer given to him ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,
that it was an aſtoniſhment to many that joyned
ſometimes with him, conſidering how ignorant he was a
little before, according to <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 11. for behold, he
prayeth. (16) he looked upon the loſs of God, more than
than the torments of hell, and feared it more. (17) he
prized Heaven, becauſe there he ſhould ſin no more. Theſe
were his own expreſſions, and what we obſerved that were
frequently with him: and Reader, do thou pray, and
watch, that thou maist not be guilty of this young man's
ſins, but pray, and labour that thou mighteſt obtain the like
evidences for Heaven.</p>

            <head>A Relation of what paſſed in the Impriſonment, and at
the Execution of Hannah Blay.</head>
            <p>H. B. belonged to a Bawdy-houſe in <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> where T. S.
uſed to frequent, and was always welcome ſo long as his
mony laſted, but having ſpent his mony, and denied entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
except he brought more mony: to which he replied, he

his Maſter, (which he could not eaſily accompliſh, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the diligence of the ſervant maid) and to murther the
maid rather than fail of getting the mony: which he according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did, &amp; goes again to <hi>H. B.</hi> and tells her what he had done,
then flies. But the juſtice of God purſued him ſo faſt, that he
was ſoon apprehended, and committed to <hi>Newgate.</hi> After he
had accuſed <hi>H. B.</hi> for putting him upon the murder, ſhe was
apprehended, and committed alſo. At the Seſſions ſhe was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
and Condemned for being acceſſary to the Murther
committed by T. S. In the time of her impriſonment, ſhe was
very rude and debauched, being ſeldom ſober, except at ſuch
times when ſhe could by no means procure drink to be drunk
withal. She often endeavoured to make T. S. drunk with her,
which ſhe once or twice effected, &amp; endeavoured very much to
draw him off from his Repentance, by driving his old trade of
ſin &amp; wickedneſs. If any adviſed her to Repentance, &amp; to take
care for the future eſtate of her ſoul, ſhe would laugh at them,
&amp; reply in ſome ſuch language as ſhe had learned in the devils
ſchool, with which ſhe was well ſtored. She was, from that Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
reprieved till the next, fully perſwading her ſelf ſhe
ſhould ſcape that bout, and ſpending her time according to her
former courſe of living, taking as little care what ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of her ſoul, as if ſhe had never offended a gracious God,
&amp; as of there was no devil to torment her, nor hell to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
in. But now Seſſions being again come, and ſhe again
brought down to the Seſſions-houſe in the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> had Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to be executed at <hi>Ratcliff</hi> where the Fact was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
The night before her Execution, the Ordinary of <hi>Newgate</hi>
came to adminiſter the Sacrament to her, which ſhe refuſed,
ſaying, ſhe could not die in Charity with ſome (whom ſhe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
judging them the cauſe of her ſecond Judgment &amp; Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
The next day, being <hi>Friday, Feb.</hi> 26. ſhe was conveyed in
a Cart from <hi>Newgate</hi> to the place of Execution, where ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her wicked life by a ſhameful death, without the leaſt ſign
of ſorrow or Repentance for her abominable whoredome and
wickedneſſes: So that howſoever notoriouſly wicked ſhe had
been in her life, anſwerable thereunto was ſhe in her ſhameful

The ſhortneſs of my time, will give me leave to
ſpend no time at all, by way of reflexion, upon the
Context; but I ſhall immediately fall upon the
words, as they lie before us: <hi>Flee youthful Luſts.</hi> In
which you may obſerve,</p>
            <p>1. An Act, <hi>Flee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Object, <hi>Luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The quality of the Object, <hi>Youthful luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctrine that I ſhall take notice of from
theſe words, is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That it is the great duty of young people,
to be exceeding careful to avoid the ſins which
uſually attend their age. <hi>Or, if you pleaſe,</hi> That it
highly concerns Young men, to flee youthful luſts.
It's no cowardiſe to flee from ſin.</p>
            <p>In the proſecution of this Doctrine, I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p>1. What are the common ſins of young people.</p>
            <p>2. What it is to flee from <hi>youthful Luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Why they ſhould flee from <hi>youthful Luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I ſhall apply it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall name ſome of thoſe ſins which young
ones are ſubject to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Young people are very apt to be diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to their Parents, or Maſters. O how great a
rarity is it, to ſee young people as ready to obey,
as their Parents are to command! Moſt children
are children of <hi>Belial;</hi> that is, without a yoak.
Let Parents command, adviſe, nay intreat, all's to
little purpoſe: How ready are they to break the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43212:26"/>
bond which God and Nature lay upon them to duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs!
Though the Command of God be plain
enough, though his Threatnings are terrible, and
though this ſin ſeldom goes unpuniſhed in this life;
yet children take little or no notice of them: one
would think that one Scripture ſhould ſcare them,
<hi>Prov. 30. 17. The eye that mocketh at his Father, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſp<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

to obey his Mother, the Ravens of the valley ſhall pick
it out, and the young Eagles ſhall eat it.</hi> What is the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
of that? Why, they ſhall come to an untimely
end. Have not the ſad Complaints of many, at <hi>Tyburn,</hi>
ſufficiently demonſtrated this to be true? Have not
many cried out, with a halter about their neck, <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
if you value your lives and ſouls, take heed of diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Parents. That was the ſin which brought me to this
untimely and ſhameful end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Another youthful ſin is, <hi>Lying:</hi> Poor children
quickly learn this Leſſon of their Father the Devil.
It is not without good reaſon, that the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi>
58. 3. gives ſuch a character of wicked children
which went aſtray from the womb, telling Lies and
the older they grow, the more skilled they be in this
deviliſh Art: it's like they are not ignorant, that it
is a ſin that cuts the bonds of all Society: it may be
they are told how dear <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> paid for
one Lie, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 3. nay, though the Word of Truth
tell them more than once, That Liars muſt dwell
with their Father the Devil, in that black Priſon,
<hi>Hell;</hi> though they hear of a Lake of Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
that burns for ever, <hi>[Rev. 21. 8.]</hi> and that ſuch
as they are, muſt be caſt into it: yet for all this they'll
venture ſtill.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Sabbath-breaking</hi> is another youthful ſin. O how
little do moſt of the young people of this City, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43212:27"/>
of Apprentices and Children that wander up
and down <hi>Monefields</hi> on the Lord's-day, ſpeak this
to be too true? they dare not make bold with their
Maſters time on the Week-daies; but as for God's
Day, that they ſpend as if God had ſet apart one day
in the Week for young people to ſleep, drink, and
play in. They dare as well eat a piece of their fingers,
almoſt, as to do that of another day, which they do
then: and the truth of it is, they look upon the
diſpleaſure of a dying man as terrible; but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of a Holy GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they make light of. O! little
do they think what precious time that is! their ſouls
are naked, and they may then have cloathing; they
are ſtarving, and they may then have food, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
is then open; Proviſions for Eternity may then
be had. But, O prodigious madneſs! the hearts of
moſt young ones ſpeak in this language, <hi>As for
Chriſti Heaven, and Soul, let them go; we have better
things to think on; more weighty matters to mind.</hi> And
is it true indeed, O young man? What, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of vain Wretches, like thy ſelf, the wanton
embraces of a whoriſh Woman, the turning off thy
cups, and damnation, more needful than the hearing
of Sermons, than Praying, and Reading, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Sure you ſhall not alwaies be of that mind! O!
little do you imagine how dear you ſhall pay for all
the pleaſures you have on the Sabbath, out of God's
Houſe. This, this was <hi>THE SIN</hi> which lay like
a load upon the ſoul of this poor <hi>Young man, The
profaning of the Sabbath;</hi> that was the bane of him.
This carried him out of God's Way, into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
Quarters. O how bitterly did he bemoan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for this ſin, as the cauſe of all the reſt! <hi>O!</hi> (ſaid

was plotting the death of my ſoul and body too.</hi> Did none

of you ſtand by the Cart, when he wept ſo bitterly,
and cried to the Lord to forgive this great and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſin? Did none of you hear how earneſtly he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of you to have a care of that ſin, as you loved
your Lives and Souls. <hi>O wretch</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that I was! I
ſtudied how I might ſpend the Lords Day in the Devils
work. I thought I could never diſhonour God enough: and
that time that I ſhould have ſerved God moſt in, I did
moſt for Satan: in them, then, I plaid my mad pranks;
I went into the Church indeed, ſometimes, but (I may
ſpeak it with ſhame and deep ſorrow now) I never heard
one whole Sermon all the time I was with my Maſter, and
indeed, I laughed at thoſe that ſpent the Sabbath in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Sermons, and Praying; and looked upon them as
the veriest fools in the world. I was glad when the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
came, that I might have time to run to my vile Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades:

ſin.</hi> Sirs, the ſubſtance of this Sermon I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from his mouth: And will you not believe a
dying man? Do you think he did but jeſt? 'Twas
on the Sabbath day he went to a whore; 'twas on
the Sabbath he robbed his Maſter, and 'twas on the
Sabbath that he killed the Maid. But becauſe this
ſin is Epidemical, I leave a ſhort ſtory with you, and
deſire you to think of it; and the if you like what
follows, break the Sabbath ſtill. The ſtory is this;
A dear Friend of mine was preaching about the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
of the Sabbath, and had occaſion to make
mention of that man that by the ſpecial command
of God was ſtoned to death for gathering ſticks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sabbath-day. Whereupon one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
ſtood up, and laughed, and made all the
haſt he could out of the Church, and went to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43212:28"/>
of ſticks, though he had no need of them;
but when the people came from the Sermon, they
found this man ſtark dead, with the bundle of ſticks
in his arms, lying in the Church-porch. And yet
for all this, there ſtands a young man in that corner
that makes nothing of idling away the Sabbath;
and there ſits another that minds not the Lord's
Day, except it be to get into wicked company, and
take his pleaſure in it. And how canſt thou endure
to hear of this, without trembling? But I fear thy
heart is ſo hard, that thou art ready to rage againſt
this reproof. Well, if the caſe be ſo, I have done with
thee: but, believe it, God hath not yet do<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e with
thee, and the Devil hath not done with thee; and
though thy Conſcience ſay nothing now, yet I tell
thee, that hath not done with thee neither. Let none
think I am tedious upon this Head: if young men
will but reform this ſin, I promiſe I will never tell
them of it more. Chriſtians (I hope that there be
ſome ſuch here) would it not be a bleſſed ſight to ſee
the Fields, the Tavern, the Whore-houſes empty,
and the Churches full? would it not be a bleſſed
Reformation? O when ſhall it once be! Which is
the ſweeter Muſick, to hear the air eccho with the
confuſed hollowing and roaring of lewd young men
playing upon the Lord's Day, or to hear the
ſound of ſinging of Pſalms, repeating of Sermons,
Praying, Reading of Scriptures? Which is like
to end beſt? <hi>Iſa. 56. 2. Amos 8. Iſa. 58. 14, 15.
Ezek.</hi> 20. 12.</p>
            <p>4. Another youthful ſin is, <hi>Miſpending of time.</hi>
Young ones think they have time enough before
them; and therefore make nothing of trifling it
away. How far are moſt from following the Apoſtles
counſel, in <hi>redeeming of the time?</hi> What, do you think
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43212:28"/>
many hours diſcourſe of filthy Bawdy ſtories, is that
redeeming of time? is ſitting up whole nights to
play at Cards and Dice, redeeming of time? Is rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
your ſelves of ſleep, to lie in the boſom of
<hi>Daliah,</hi> redeeming time? If this be redeeming of
time, then ſome of our young ones, and many of
our Gallants, redeem time bravely. 'Twas a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
one, that of <hi>Seneca; if</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>one ask me for
my Purſe, I am not ve<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y willing to give it him; if he beg all
my Estate, I think it a mad request: but if he ask me to
paſs away time with him, two or three daies of time, I paſs
not much upon it, but it's eaſily granted; and thus one of
the moſt precious things in the World is vilified.</hi> O little do
people think how glad they ſhall be one day of one
of thoſe hours that they ſpent in foolery! Oh call
Time again, will be the language of more than one,
upon a death-bed. Could you talk with ſome of the
mad young ones that are in Hell, that lived five or
ſix years ago in as much pleaſure as you do now,
and ſpent their time like you; but it may be, little
dreamed of being in Hell ſo ſoon, but might reckon
of forty or fifty years to live; could you, I ſay, talk
with them, and ask them what they think of time
now? They would quickly ſay, Oh! a World for
one praying hour. Oh! where are the people to be
found, that ſeriouſly conſider, that there is not a
moment of time but we muſt be accountable for.
'Twas excellently ſpoke of that poor young man,
when he was in <hi>Newgate</hi> amongſt the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>mmon Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners;
one Sabbath-day they asked <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to play at
Cards with them: <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you and I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe to do with our time, than to play at Cards! Is it
now a time for us to be ſporting away the Sabbath, when we
have but one poor Sand left to work for Eternity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:43212:29"/>
5. Another youthful ſin is, <hi>Keeping bad Company.</hi>
Are there not many of the Devils Emiſſaries, that
make it their buſineſs to decoy poor young ones? O
what a happineſs do they promiſe them! a goodly
happineſs indeed to carry them to the Devil! 'Twas
not without cauſe that <hi>David</hi> (in <hi>Pſal. 1. 1.)</hi> did
pronounce them bleſſed that had leaſt to do in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
company. Whatever deluded Creatures think of
their mad jovial company; one that is well in his
wits, looks upon their ſociety as an emblem of Hell,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 120. The young man, upon whoſe account we
are here met this day, told me, That two or three
wicked fellows firſt, got him out to ſpend a penny;
but little did he think whither they were leading
of him; and after they had been at one place, they
carried him to another, till at laſt they brought
him to that houſe, out of which few go without
their Deaths-wound. This was the general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of them that went this laſt Aſſizes to <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
And yet how are ſilly ſouls pleaſed with ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
whoſe greateſt kindneſs is to make them go
merrily to Hell? And are they ſtill ſuch ſweet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
Creatures, that you can't love too much, who
do what they can poſſibly to deprive you of your
trueſt happineſs, and make you miſerable for ever?
O how will your boon Companions greet one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Hell, nay, it may be, upon Earth too? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I was once with a drunkard that lay a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and after I had prayed with him, in comes one
of his old Companions in ſin, and asked him how he
did: at which he was ready to gnaſh his teeth, and
made this dreadful reflection concerning him, to me.
<hi>O that, that was the wicked wretch that drew me away: if
it had not been for him, I had not been in ſo lamentable a
caſe upon a death-bed,</hi> Prov. 1. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:43212:29"/>
6. The ſixth youthful ſin is, <hi>Curſing</hi> and <hi>Swearing.</hi>
How ready are young ones to learn the language of
their Father? it was not long ſince that I heard a
little Boy ſwear at every ſentence he ſpoke. O what
will ſuch be when they come to be old, if they begin
ſo ſoon? ſcarce creep on their feet, and yet running
poſt to Hell! O how many are there of this Daring
Generation, that bend their tongues like bows, and
ſhoot thoſe Arrows againſt Heaven, which will fall
down dipt in the poiſon of Divine Fury. It would
make ones heart ake, to hear how ſome belch out
their helliſh Oaths! to hear how cruelly they take
in the Wounds of Chriſt, and crucifie him afreſh; not
conſidering that at the ſame time they are butcher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their own ſouls: and if one tell them of their
Swearing, how ready are they to ſwear, That they
did not ſwear; and turn and laugh, as if it were a
creditable thing to be like the Devil, and an honour
to make haſt to Hell? O how many are there of his
Black Crew, that brave it out with their <hi>Damn-me</hi>
and <hi>Sink-me,</hi> and Oaths, as if they would dare the
Almighty to his very face, and as if there were little
of truth in God's Threatnings, and his Anger a
very light matter! O ſinner! What if God ſhould
take thee at thy word, when the next <hi>Damn-me</hi> is in
thy mouth, and ſtop thy breath, with an Oath in
thy mouth? What if God ſhould go to curſing too?
Do you know what a dreadful Word that is, <hi>Go thou
curſed?</hi> O! What if God ſhould ſwear too, <hi>That
thou ſhalt never enter into his reſt?</hi> Couldſt thou but ſee
the flaming tongues of thoſe horrid ſinners that know
what the meaning of that word, <hi>Damn-me</hi> is couldſt
thou but ſee how they bite thoſe tongues for mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
it may be it would make thee think, that an
Oath is no ſuch light matter. You ſay, <hi>words are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43212:30"/>
but wind:</hi> but believe it, this wind will riſe to ſuch a
Storm, as will not be allaid, without deep repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
till it hath blown thee into hell. Did you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read the third of <hi>Mal. v. 5. I will come near to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and will be a ſwift witneſs againſt the falſe Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and ſuch as fear not me, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> But
you'l ſay, <hi>your tongues are your own, who is Lord over us,</hi>
Pſal. 12. 4. You ſhall hear one ſhortly, that will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that queſtion, and let you know, that he is
Lord over that, and that your own Tongues ſhall be
made to condem you. But what is it that I ſee? How
does that ſwearing Wretch ſtorm and rage there at
me, for telling him of his ſins? Come, come, ſinner,
if you ſpare not God, I promiſe you I will not ſpare
you: and I tell thee, What thou heareſt, is nothing
to what thou ſhalt feel.</p>
            <p>7. The next youthful luſt that I ſhall mention, is
<hi>Drunkenneſs.</hi> Do not many (I wiſh old ones were not
here too guilty) act as if their buſineſs in this World,
was to eat, and drink, and take their pleaſures?
The Devil bids them read the Text, <hi>Eccleſ. 11. 9.
Rejoyce, O young men;</hi> and they are eaſily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to take his counſel: and ſo they drink, and
roar, and conſider not what a reckoning will be
brought in at laſt; neither do they ſtand till they
have read the latter part of that verſe; <hi>but know
that for all theſe things God will bring thee to judgment.</hi>
Not conſidering the meaning of that whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is but this; <hi>Go, young man, lie at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
and Alehouſes, do; drink, and be drunk; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
this, you ſhall be damn'd for it; and God will
make you take off t'other Cup, whether you will or no,
and that is a Cup ſpiced with Wrath and Fury.</hi> But
you ſee not, neither do you yet feel it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you do but laugh at all this; you ſay with thoſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43212:30"/>
in <hi>Matt. 24. 49. My Master delaies his coming,</hi> and
therefore you eat and drink with the Drunkards:
you ſay, let him talk till his heart akes, I will never
leave my Pleaſure for you: why Man! Wilt thou
then be deſperate? Dare you ſay, <hi>I'll drink,</hi> though
there be <hi>Death</hi> in the Pot, though <hi>Hell</hi> be at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Cup? or do you think that God will be
worſe than his word? and, that though he threaten
high, yet he means no ſuch matter. O ſinner, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not thy ſelf, and if you forget the reſt, carry
home but that one Text, <hi>Deut. 29. 9, 10. If any one
hear the words of this curſe, and yet bleſs himſelf in his
heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the
imagination of mine own heart, and add drunkenneſs to
thirſt, the Lord will not ſpare him, &amp;c.</hi> Do you read on,
and read it again, and think of that Scripture the
next time that you ſit down to your Cups. Little do
poor creatures think how dreadful a ſin <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi>
is, and how many it bringeth with it: I'll tell you of
one ſtory of my own knowledg, and then I ſhall leave
this: A certain Drunkard that I knew very well,
when he was in drink, quarrelled with his Fellow-ſervant,
and after a few words, knocked him down
with his Flail, and killed him at one blow. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
by Friends, he made a ſhift to eſcape the Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and comes home again, and ſwears, and curſes,
and drinks at as high a rate as ever: but at laſt, when
he was in the ſame yard where he did this Murder,
he dropt down dead in a moment; and I was one of
the firſt that ſaw him.</p>
            <p>8. Another youthful ſin is, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs.</hi> Is not
<hi>England</hi> too near a kin to <hi>France?</hi> Do not many of
our young ones act as if they took pattern by <hi>Sodom,</hi>
and had learned of <hi>Gomorrah? Jeremiah</hi> made ſad
complaint, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 7. And are we leſs guilty? Doth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43212:31"/>
not the Scripture ſpeak plain enough againſt this ſin?
Though the Pope count it a <hi>Vemal fault,</hi> yet thoſe
that are guilty of it, will find, that his <hi>Pardon</hi> will
give them little eaſe, when they are caſt into a Bed
of Flames. Sure our hot young men ſeldom read the
book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> but act as if that ſimple young man
<hi>(Prov. 7. 13.)</hi> did run no great hazzard. What was it
that brought <hi>Thomas Savage</hi> to Theft and Murder?
what brought him to that ſhameful death? O how
bitterly did he take on, that he ſhould ever ſee the
face of that <hi>Vile Woman!</hi> O! had he but conſidered
whither he was going, and that moſt of her Gueſts
go to Hell? had be but thought ſeriouſly, how bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that ſin would prove, I believe he would have lain
in Flames, as ſoon as with that <hi>abominable woman.</hi> Did
none of you hear what he ſaid when he was upon the
Cart? Did none of you ſee with what earneſtneſs he
ſpoke? Why, this was one great thing that he begg'd
of you young ones, as his dying requeſt, That you
would have a care of this ſin.</p>
            <p>9. The next youthful ſin that I ſhould mention, is
<hi>Theft. Drunkenneſs</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs</hi> are two coſtly
ſins, eſpecially the latter; and poor creatures are
uſually ſo bewitched with that, that Credit, Purſe,
Body, Soul, and all, muſt go, rather than that beaſtly
ſin ſhould not be gratified. How many Servants are
there that wrong their Maſters, imbezel their Goods,
and ſecretly waſt them by the fore-mentioned ſin:
and I believe I need not tell you what a tragical end
<hi>Theft hath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Prodigy of her Sex, and diſgrace of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
could not be ſatisfied with Wine and good
Chear; her Purſe muſt be fed as well as her ſtinking
Carcaſe: <hi>What do you come hither</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Mony? Why, where ſhould I have it,</hi> ſaid he? <hi>What
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43212:31"/>
hath your Maſter none?</hi> replied that Monſter. <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid
he, <hi>but I never wronged him, neither can I. Nay,</hi> ſaid ſhe,
<hi>if you be thereabout, come no more here.</hi> But alas! the
poor Creature is inſnared, ſo that he cannot but go
to ask counſel of this Daughter of the Devil, how
he ſhould manage his matters, ſo as to get that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
which his Maſter had. She makes a ready reply,
and adviſeth, To murder the Maid, to bury the theft.
O that unfaithful ſervants would think of theſe
things, and now and then read that Scripture, <hi>Tit. 2.
10.</hi> and <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 6.</p>
            <p>I ſhould here ſpeak ſomething of the bloody ſin
of <hi>Murder;</hi> but the Word of God, the Laws of Men,
the Power of Conſcience, and the ſignal Judgments
of God againſt ſuch, puts me in ſome hope, that I
need not much inſiſt upon that. I ſhall add but one
ſin more.</p>
            <p>10. Another youthful ſin is, <hi>Incorrigibleneſs.</hi> How
reſolutely do moſt young ones go on in their ſins?
How hardly brought ſo much as to debate the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſoberly with themſelves or others? How do
they fly in the face of them which reprove them, as
if it were ten times a greater fault for to <hi>reprove</hi>
ſin, than to <hi>commit</hi> it. Nay, ſome are come to that
heighth, that they make but a mock of Hell and
Judgment, as well as Sin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 19. But theſe are
ſo vile a Generation, that I have little hopes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
with them, <hi>Pſal. 28. 4, 5. Jer. 22. 21. Gen.</hi>
19. 14.</p>
            <p>11. The next thing I propoſed to ſpeak to, was,
<hi>To ſh<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w you what it is to flee ſin.</hi> In this I ſhall be very
brief.</p>
            <p>1. Not to commit it. Take not up this Serpent,
for it hath a deadly ſting in the tail of it. Embrace
not this <hi>Dalilah,</hi> for ſhe will betray thee. Haſt away,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43212:32"/>
avoid it; if you do not, it is as much as your life,
the life of your ſoul is worth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Flee;</hi> That is, avoid the very occaſions of ſin. It's
ill jeſting with edge-tools. They are ſafeſt, that
are fartheſt from it. A hundred to one but thou art
caught, if thou play with the Bait. Who, but a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
would take ſtrong poiſon into his mouth, and
ſay that he will then ſpit it out? Who would chuſe
to ſleep upon the top of a Maſt? Believe it, Sin is
one of the moſt dangerous things in the World, and
he that tampers with it, plays with Hell, and is ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Devil, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Flee;</hi> that is, hate it with a perfect hatred. Say,
<hi>What have I to do with Idols any more? How ſhall I do
this, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Labour for a ſpiritual anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
againſt ſin, and to loath it, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi>
yea, as God himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 23.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Flee,</hi> and perſwade others to <hi>flee:</hi> for the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is not inconſiderable. Tell others what ſin will
prove at laſt, and perſwade them to conſider what
the wages of ſuch work will be, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 157.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> Why ſhould we flee youthful lusts?</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe our Captain bids us <hi>flee:</hi> we have his
Commiſſion, nay, his abſolute Command; may I
not ſay, his Entreaty too? What is the meaning of
all thoſe pathetical Expoſtulations, <hi>Turn you, turn
you, Why will you die?</hi> Why doth he bid us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you to look about you? What is the deſign of
all the Scripture? Wherefore do we Preach, and
Pray? Methinks the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould be
like thoſe Angels that warned <hi>Lot</hi> to <hi>flee</hi> out of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
and when he lingred, they pulled him, and
bid him haſte, and flee for his life. I might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
in Scriptures for the proof of this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.
11, 14.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:43212:32"/>
2. Becauſe of the danger of not fleeing. If the
Wrath of God, if Hell and Damnation, if everlaſting
Miſery be to be avoided, then Sin is: for as ſure
as God is true, Sinners muſt be damned if they flee
not ſin.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe of the benefit we ſhall have by fleeing
ſin. We ſhall be everlaſtingly ſecured, if Heaven and
Glory be worth the getting, if Happineſs and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
conſiderable, if a Kingdom and Crown be
worth the having, this may be obtained by fleeing

Some of you are come here this day to hear news,

do you think the deepeſt Oaths the beſt Rhetorick,
and moſt graceful, if I may ſo ſpeak, to your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe?
What language do you ſpeak, the language
of <hi>Canaan,</hi> or the language of <hi>Aſhdod?</hi> Can you
ſtretch your ſelves upon beds of Ivory, and drink
Wine from morning to night, and look upon this as

embraces of a wanton woman? and cannot you uſe
unſeemly dalliance, and ſay, <hi>Am I not in ſport?</hi> Did

and yet there ſtands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a ſly ſinner, no more affected
than the ground he treads on: thou thinkſt I do not
know thee; but that, if poſſible, I may ſtop thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou comeſt to the Gallows and Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall do
what I can for my ſoul to reach thee. Wherefore
give me leave, in the next place, to ſpeak one word
by way of <hi>Conviction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Young people, I am not come this day to tell you
News; my buſineſs is not to tickle your ears, but to
do what I can poſſibly to keep you from that place
of ſhame, the <hi>Gibbet;</hi> and that place of torment-<hi>Hell.</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:43212:33"/>
I believe that here are many here, that I ſhall
never ſee nor ſpeak to while the World ſtands; and
that our next meeting will be before the judgment-Seat
of Chriſt: and therefore I muſt tell you, I muſt
not ieſt with you. I ſpeak to thoſe that are guilty;
you know well enough who I mean. Let me ask you
ſoberly, Do you believe that there is a God? and
that he is privy to all you do? And dare you out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
God with your wickedneſs? Or do you make
account his eye is nothing, ſo man doth not know;
Say you ſo? Believe it, ſinner, you will ſhortly know,
that God and your Conſcience are witneſſes enough
to caſt you: and is this nothing? are not the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of a God to be regarded? Shall the Lion roar,
and will not ſuch a Beaſt as you tremble? Know this,
as ſtoutly as you brave it out now, you will ſhortly
quake. But you are reſolved, come on it what will,
venture you will: But hold ſinner, I prethee let's
reaſon the caſe a little; do not act like a Fool and a
Mad-man: Were you ever in <hi>Newgate?</hi> Do you
know what a Priſon is? Are Fetters ſuch deſirable
things? Hath the Devil done you ſo much kindneſs,
as that you muſt venture your liberty for his ſake?
Come tell me, ſinner, what good did the devil ever
do for thee willingly? Is it worth the while to do
and ſuffer ſo much for one that never intended any
good to any in the World. Conſider a little, young
man, is it nothing to come gingling in your chains
before an Earthly Judge? Is the ſight of the Bench
nothing? Is it nothing to have your villany laid
open before the World? How do you think you ſhall
look, when Evidence comes in clear, and the <hi>Jury</hi>
ſhall caſt you? What, brave it out ſtill! But what will
you ſay, when the Judg ſhall paſs ſentence upon
you, <hi>to be carried from thence to the Priſon; and from
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43212:34"/>
that, to the place of Execution?</hi> It is nothing to have
ten thouſand Spectators of your ſhameful end? But
methinks I hear ſome of that helliſh rout laughing,
and ſaying, <hi>It is but a ſwing or two, and then all's over,</hi>
their miſery's at an end. But hold there ſinner, then
thy miſery will begin, for thou ſhalt appear immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
before the Bar of God, and there receive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſentence ten thouſand times more dreadful than
the former. What, do you make nothing of that
dreadful word, <hi>Depart thou curſed?</hi> and then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
the devil takes your ſoul. They wait for their
prey; and thou muſt be reſerved in chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
in unſpeakable and unavoidable torments, to
the Judgment of the great day, and then thy curſed
body and ſoul ſhall meet; O what a dreadful greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will that be! when body and ſoul ſhall be caſt
into everlaſting flames. Well, young man, now what
do you ſay? Is it beſt venturing ſtill? But it may
be, thou beginneſt to think what a ſtrange cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man is this? Such Preaching is enough to make
one out of their wits: What, is there no ſuch thing
as repentance, a Grace a God one may be ſaved for
all your railing. What do you think of <hi>Tho. Savage?</hi>
did not he repent? I hope you will not ſay that he
is in Hell. No indeed, for I verily believe that he is
a Saint in Glory; but how do you know whether
God will give you repentance? I muſt tell you, he
is a ſingular inſtance, ſuch a one as we ſhall ſcarce
hear of in an age: and I remember, <hi>that he that is
oft reproved, and hardens his heart, ſhall ſuddenly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
and that without remedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though I ſpeak thus, Brethren, I hope better
things of many here, and things that do accompany
Salvation. I am perſwaded here are ſome young ones
that had as live venture their lives, as indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43212:34"/>
in the forementioned youthful Luſts. I think
I have ſome ground to ſay what I do. Brethren, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you make not my boaſting void; neither let me
be aſhamed of my confidence. I am perſwaded, I ſay
again, that ſome of you now hate what ſometimes
you did delight in; and though it may be in the days
of your darkneſs, you lived in your ſins, yet now fear
to fall into them, as much as you fear Hell. Courage
my Brethren, go on bravely, and the Lord be with
you; you are the hopes and joy of old Chriſtians,
they bleſs God from their hearts to ſee ſuch Flowers
in Gods Garden; hold but out, be ſtrong, and quit
you like men, and heaven ſhall be yours, as ſure as if
you were already there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 4. I ſhall here ſpeak ſomething by way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to Maſters of Families, and Parents. It lies
much in your power to ſet a ſtop to that mighty tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of wickedneſs, that doth almoſt overflow this
City. Remember Sirs, what a dreadful ſin the ſin of
Murder is. What then do you think of thoſe that
murder ſouls, that ſtarve ſouls? How do you think
God will take it at your hands that you ſhould be ſo
careful that your work be done, and never mind his
at all? Is it nothing to you, that one that dwells un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your roof, muſt dwell in everlaſting burnings?
Are you ſo barbarous as to be indifferent whether
your ſervants and children are damned or ſaved?
What can you anſwer, when thoſe of your own houſe
ſhall ſtand before the great God, and ſay, <hi>Lord, if it
had not been for my Maſter, I had never ſinned againſt
thee at the rate that I did. He never told me any thing of
the danger of ſin, he would be ſure to call me up betimes
to look after his buſineſs; and if I neglected that, I ſhould
quickly hear of it: but as for the Lords Day, praying or
reading, or any thing that concerned God or my ſoul, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43212:35"/>
was ſo much as reproved for the neglecting of them.
O! if I had been but told of ſuch a dreadful place as this
is, and what ſin would end in, ſure I ſhould never have
ventured as I did.</hi> Sirs, I beſeech you think how you
ſhall anſwer ſuch an accuſation at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
as ſure as you live, you will then be ſpeechleſs.
<hi>Parents,</hi> methinks you have ſomething within you, to
put you upon your duty. What, have you <hi>no love</hi> at
all to the fruit of your Bodies? Is it no great matter
whether your children ſink or ſwim? would you be
contented to ſee them in a houſe that is in a Flame, &amp;
do nothing to get them out? Would you have your
children fire-brands of Hell for ever? will you do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to reſcue them from that devouring Lion, who
would tear them in pieces? can you bear to hear them
cry out againſt you, and ready to fly in your faces?
Doth it never trouble you to think what a greeting
you ſhall have in another World, when they ſhall
curſe the day that ever they ſaw you, when they ſhall
ſay, <hi>I may thank you for this dreadful miſery; you never
catechiſed me; you never told me one word of this place
of torment; you never corrected me for my ſin; if you had,
it may be I ſhould not have lain under this intollerable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.</hi>
What do you ſay, Sirs, to theſe things? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
they call for your ſerious conſideration. Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if theſe be not weighty matters, I know not what
be. Let me ask you in meekneſs, whether it be not
a piece of the moſt barbarous cruelty in the world, to
let your children and ſervants run to hell, without
doing what in you lies to ſtop them? But I hope, by
this time, ſome of you are a little convinced of the
dreadfulneſs of the loſs of a ſoul, &amp; are loth to have
the guilt of the blood of ſouls to lie upon you for
ever; and therefore begin to ask, what ſhall you do,
that you and yours may be ſaved, and your ſervants
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43212:35"/>
and Children might eſcape the ſnares of Satan, and
<hi>flee youthful luſts?</hi> And you in good earneſt Friends?
And will you promiſe, as in the preſence of God,
that you will do what you can poſſibly, to diſcharge
your duty, and to follow thoſe directions that I ſhall
give you? In hopes that ſome are reſolved, by the
help of God, to do what in them lies, for the keeping
all under their charge from everlaſting burnings, I
ſhall adviſe you:</p>
               <p>1. Be good your ſelves, and labour to be patterns
of Holineſs, and to ſhew your children and ſervants
by your converſation, that you your ſelves believe
that there is a God, an immortal Soul, Heaven, Hell,
and Eternity: let your language be ſavoury, and ſpeak
you to be one that hath been with Jeſus. Let your
actions be regulated by the Word, and endeavour to
let them know, that you are not in jeſt when you
ſpeak of God and their ſouls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>2. I charge you, as in the preſence of God, as you
will anſwer the neglect of it at the Bar of that great
Judg, take an exact account of your ſervants how
they ſpend their time, what company they keep, what
they do upon the Sabbath; &amp; if you would make any
thing of Religion, be as careful that the Sabbath be
ſpent in God's ſervice, as the Week-daies in yours.
I could tell you of a ſervant that was wont, many a
time and oft, to complain of his Maſter, and ſay,
<hi>If my Maſter had ever examined me the Text on the Lords-day,
or called one to any account where I had been, or what I
had heard, I am perſwaded I ſhould never have come to ſo
ſad an end as I am like to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Inſtruct them oft in the matters that concern
their eternal welfare. Sirs, tell them I beſeech you,
with all the earneſtneſs that you can for your lives,
of the danger of ſin; give them wholſome advice; tell
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43212:36"/>
them of the neceſſity of Converſion; allow them a
little time to pray and read, and let them know that
you take notice of any thing that is good in them.</p>
               <p>4. Pray for them; cry to the Lord mightily, and
ſay, O that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> may live in thy ſight: Lord, haſt
thou not a bleſſing, O my Father, for me and mine?
O pity dear Lord, my children and my ſervants; and
let all under my roof be of the houſhold of faith, and
of the Family of the Lord Jeſus. And now once more
I beg you to be in good earneſt; 'twill be the trueſt
evidence of the truth of your grace, to be faithful in
this work. 'Twill be your joy upon a death-bed;
'twill be your Crown in another world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 5. One word by way of advice to you young
people. Brethren, you ſaw yeſterday what it was to
fall into youthful luſts; and to day you have heard
ſomething of the danger of theſe ſins. Methinks by
this time you ſhould be in a rage againſt ſin: me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
you ſhould all ſay, Well, now I will never
ſpend the Sabbath day as I have done: I'le never come
near the company of vile women: This, I hope ſhall
be a warning to me as long as I live. Are you (in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſadneſs) of this mind? O that the Lord would keep
this always upon your hearts. O that you may not
now get out into the cold world, and ſhake off the
ſenſe of theſe things. But do I not ſee ſome weeping
eyes, aking hearts? And what doſt thou ſay, poor
ſoul? <hi>O Sir, I am the man you mean! But is it poſſible for
me to eſcape Hell? I have lived in almoſt all thoſe ſins for
many a year; what ſhall I do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall anſwer this honeſt requeſt, and the God of
love and power ſend it home.</p>
               <p>1. Labour to be acquainted with the Principles of
Religion. Be much in reading of the Scriptures,
ſearch, &amp; you will find never a word there to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43212:36"/>
ſin, but all againſt it; they will make you wiſe
to ſalvation; conſult the word, and you will eſcape
the wrath to come, which ſhall ſurely fall upon thoſe
that live and die in youthful ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 9.</p>
               <p>2. Labour to underſtand wherein your happineſs
lies. It lies not in Riches, Pleaſures, and Honours,
but in the favour of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. Seek firſt the
Kingdom of Heaven, and the righteouſneſs thereof;
ſet your affections on things that are above, and not
on things below.</p>
               <p>3. To be ſure, keep the Sabbath ſtrictly, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon a powerful Miniſtry. Then is the time to
buy Proviſions to live upon for ever.</p>
               <p>4. Keep good company. Get out of wicked mens
ſociety. Mark thoſe that walk ſoberly, and that mind
their ſouls, and make much of them; and beg an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in their Prayers, and take their advice. If you
once grow weary of good company, I ſhall have little
hopes of you; and it's a ſign God means good to
poor ſouls, when they are very deſirous to be in with
them that are dear to God; A warm Chriſtian-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
O Sirs, you cannot value him too highly,
<hi>1 Cor. 15. 33. 1 Pet. 4. 4. Heb.</hi> 6. 12.</p>
               <p>5. Take heed of ſinning againſt conſcience. Let
<hi>David</hi>'s Prayer be yours, <hi>Pſ. 19. 13. Keep back thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
from preſumptuous ſins, let them not have dominion
over me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Take heed of putting off Repentance; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
now thy Creator; now is the acceptable time:
O, if you value your lives, make haſt, and delay not
an hour, but go home, &amp; fall upon your knees, &amp; beg
of God to give you repentance unto life; give God
no reſt day nor night till he have charged your heart,
and made you ſee your need of a Chriſt, and made
you to give your ſelf to Chriſt. O cry out this
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43212:37"/>
night, a Chriſt, dear Lord, a Chriſt for my poor ſoul,
or I am loſt for ever. <hi>Eccleſ. 12. 1. Pſal.</hi> 119. 62.</p>
               <p>7. Be much in conſideration; commune now and
then with your heart, &amp; think ſeriouſly whither you
are going, and ask your ſoul what a condition it is in,
&amp; what it hath to bear it up againſt the fear of death,
&amp; what proviſions are made for eternity; look into
your purſe, what mony haſt thou that will go currant
in another world. Spend much time in thinking. I
askt this poor boy how he ſpent his time in priſon:
he anſwered, in prayer, reading, and conſideration.</p>
               <p>8. Neglect not Prayer; ask and you ſhall have, ſeek
and you ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto
you; be frequent and ſerious in this duty, forget not
ſecret Prayer, and look after your Prayers, and be
not content except you hear of them again.</p>
               <p>9. Be diligent in your calling; be not <hi>ſlothful</hi> in your
worldly buſineſs, idleneſs is the <hi>devils ſhop, Rom.</hi> 11. 12.</p>
               <p>10. Hold out to the end: remember what they ſhall
have that conquer, reſolve for Chriſt and Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any terms Well Sirs, now my work is done; have
I been beating the air? what will become of theſe
two Sermons? yeſterday you heard one out of the
Cart, and from the Gibbet, and to day from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit;
and what are you reſolved to do? what, ſhall
the tears, prayers, and intreaties of that dying young
man be ſo ſoon forgotten? if they are, can the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the living God be ſo eaſily contemned? is
there nothing in all that I have been ſpeaking? what,
are you ſtill of the ſame mind that you were, or are
you not? I ſay again, I muſt leave you, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
to one whether I ſhall ever ſee you or ſpeak to
you more; once more I charge you, as you love
your own ſoul, as you fear the wrath of God, and
the flames of hell; <hi>Flee youthful luſts.</hi>
