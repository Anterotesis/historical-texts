         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Item that euery ſuch Engliſh Papiſt
is a traytor to the Quéene of England,
and hateth her life, wiſheth the alteration
of her gouernement, and liueth in hope of
an other world, which euen by an ordinary

            <p>Item that euery ſuch Engliſhe Papiſt

            <p>Item that no clemencie, gentleneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites,

            <p>Item that Papiſtrie hath this propertie

            <p>Item that as it is reaſon that the owner
of a ſhepebiter maſtife, knowing his dogs
qualitie, ſhould either hang vp his dog,
or paye for the ſhéepe that his dog wori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
ſo thoſe that haue notorious Shepebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
murderers of Gods flocke, in theyr

either to hang vp or otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
their curres, or ells to anſwere to
God for the bloud of his ſhéepe, both ſuch
as they haue deſtroyed, and ſuch as they
may deſtroy by any poſſibilitie hereafter.</p>
            <p>Item that all aduiſes to great perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
to perſuade neutralitie or an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning
of contrary ſides in religion with
vncertaintie of countenance and fauor,
is the way to ſupplant aſſured ſafetie, to
make ſure enimies and vnſure frendes, to
yle open to paraſites &amp; traytors, to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen

Item that timorous policie is the worſt
policie that may be, what ſoeuer the cauſe
be, good or bad, and worſt of all it is in beſt
cauſes: wherein as her maieſtie hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
want of conſtant magnanimitie, nor
cauſe of feare, ſo is it méete that her eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
haue no ſtomake to contemne her,
nor by exceſſe of clemencie to miſconſtrue
her goodneſſe as lacke of daring.</p>
            <p>Item that by the great nouelties and
alterations of times that haue happened
within our memorie, there is riſen a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
policie among people, to ioyne to
ſtrong and ſafe ſides, whereby they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liened
from the fearefull, and therefore it
is to be prouided, that there be a boldneſſe
of ſafetie to ſerue the Quéene truely and

her enemies.</p>
            <p>Item by boldneſſe and ſharpe executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vpon enemies, the frendes are encora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and contrariwiſe if the dangerous
traytor be not remoued, the true ſubiect

to venture ſo farr agayne, and the
fréedome of conſultation in the meane
time for preſeruing the prince empeched.</p>
            <p>Item that it is truely ſayd <hi>Improbum
<pb facs="tcp:13707:7"/>

with a dangerous noughty man, than to

            <p>Item that occaſions and fitte opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
ouerſlipped are not recouerable.</p>
            <p>Item that many times it is as ſmall an
offenſe to geue a warrant to kill a true
man, as to pardon a murderer or traytor,
as a wiſe ſhepeherd will rather geue leaue
to a hunter to kill the beſt lambe in hys
flocke, than to let goe a foxe or a wolfe.</p>
            <p>Item that the liues of kinges and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are the liues and ſoules of theyr king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and common weales, whereby
they are to conſider that in being prodigall

they be liberall of that which is not
theyr owne to geue.</p>
            <p>Item that no traytor is more perilous,
than he that wreſteth the law to rayſe an
vnderminer of the princes crowne to her
danger.</p>
            <p>Item that he is iuſtly to be ſuſpected
that ſhall practiſe with any vayne deuiſe of

pacification, or colored clemencie, to rebat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or

ſo to tye it in the ſcaberde that it may not

abuſe that moſt reuerend and holy ſigne
of maieſtie to no good ende or other end

            <p>Item that God can not well take it, if
he be leſſe zelouſly ſerued than the diuell,
that there be leſſe feruencie ſhewed by tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>Item that Gods commandementes of

reuenge of priuate diſpleaſures, and
not againſt ſeueritie &amp; ſharpe execution in

            <p>The full proofe and larger explication
of theſe concluſions, though it be eaſy, as a

thing which not onely all conuenientie of

Here any moſt excellent orators ſpecial-vertues

            <p>For the firſt article that defineth pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes,

<pb facs="tcp:13707:9"/>
from the worde of God, is in that ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticle
a papiſt, as for example the hereſie of

not euery ſuch a one wholy a papiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

of a traitorous Papiſt, but ſuch a one as
holdeth all the Popes doctrine to be true,
that the Romane church erreth not, that
it hath rightfully ſuch ſuperioritie and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie
in others kingdomes and dioceſces
as it hath proudly claimed &amp; vſurped, and
that Chriſtians are bound to referre their
fayth vnto it, and to hang vpon the Popes
determinations. Many men otherwiſe
good &amp; honeſt ſubiectes are not yet purged
of all errors wherwith Rome hath infec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
them, &amp; muſt haue their tyme to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
inſtructed. But thoſe that are perfect
Papiſtes,<note place="margin">Which Papiſtes, be traitors</note> that publiſh the Pope to be head
of the church (which yet in dede is no
member of the true church) and would
haue vs with an implicite &amp; bond faith, to
depend vpon that ſea, &amp; for that reaſon will
refuſe by all lawful meanes to confeſſe the
right of Princes in their kingdomes ouer
all their ſubiectes, they be perfect traitors
in deede, yea and the learned ſort of them
<pb facs="tcp:13707:9"/>
be wilfull heretikes &amp; traitors.<note place="margin">Learned Papiſtes wilfull traytors.</note> For though
in the darke tymes, when controuerſies of
religion were not brought into ſearching,
the ſtreame of error caried men awaye
without douting, yet ſince that by deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the light hath bene euidently opened,
and men haue ſought and throughly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
the matter, there is no learned pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
but he knoweth he mainteineth error,
and in defending and ſpreading the ſame
he defendeth and ſpreadeth, and ſo directly,
aduiſedly, wilfully, and maliciouſly, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in execution to his vttermoſt power,
hye treaſons againſt God, againſt kinges,
and kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Againſt God I cal them treaſons,<note place="margin">Treaſon offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie.</note> though
our law, the iudge of ciuil treaſons in Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land,

of the offence ſo properly receaueth
that title, and alſo the vſuall name of hye
treaſon <hi>in iure gentium,</hi> in the common
law of nations, and in other languages,
doth ſo playnely expreſſe it. Hye treaſons
are in their true nature, offences againſt
hye maieſtie, that is, either to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the perſons, or denyall and deface<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the iuſt dignities and authorities
of thoſe that beare the name of maieſtie,
<pb facs="tcp:13707:10"/>
and to whom the hyeſt dutie of obedience
faith and alleageance extendeth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is treaſon called <hi>Crimen leſae maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatis,</hi>
the crime of violating or abating of
maieſtie. Greater maieſtie than the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
of God can not be, therefore hyer and
verier treaſons then againſt God can not
be.<note place="margin">Treaſon againſt God.</note> His perſon can not be deſtroyed, or tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched:
his dignitie, honor, glorie, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
may be ſclaundered and blaſphemed,
and his ſubiectes, that is, mortall men,
may be withdrawen from their due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and drawen into rebellion againſt
him. And this I ſay is hye treaſon to God,
to violate or abate the maieſtie of God:
and this do papiſtes. For though God be
king of the whole world, and ſo is rightly
called the Lord by vniuerſall name, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
of deuilles: yet is hys chirch hys more
proper and certaine kingdome, whereby
he is more reſtrainedly and aptly called
our king and our father, and ſo more fitly
called our head in reſpect of the body, which
is his chirch and not the reſt of the worlde.
In this kingdome hys hyeſt dignitie is to
be the onely head thereof, which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes
take from him, and deriue it to their
Pope. And though with gloſes they excuſe
<pb facs="tcp:13707:10"/>
it, that theyr Popes take it not from God,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> vnder God, as his vicars, yet
muſt they be admoniſhed, that wythout
ſufficient deputation and warrant from
the kyng himſelfe, (which the Pope hath
not) the ſubiect to thruſt himſelfe into go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernance
of the kingdome is hye treaſon,
where he that being a ſtranger would ſeke
to conquere it, were but an enemy. And ſo
is it rightly to be ſayd that the Turke is
to God an enemy, and the Pope is to God
a traytor, and all his adherentes principall
traytors, for treaſon admitteth no acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>Alſo one great part of Gods maieſtie
ſtandeth in making of lawes, to gouerne
his kingdome, that hys ſhéepe ſhall heare
hys voyce and no ſtrangers. Againſt which
poynt of maieſtie, as it is hye treaſon to
publiſh lawes and proclamations in ciuile
kynges names againſt their wyll, ſo are
papiſtes hye traytors in publiſhing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing
lawes, proclamations, and decrées
from a climing and vſurping tyrant to
bynde Gods ſubiectes the chirch, wythout
the wyll and warrant of God.</p>
            <p>Alſo rebelliouſly to burne, deſtroy,
tread downe, or deface in great contempt,
<pb facs="tcp:13707:11"/>
the commiſſions and lawes of temporall
kynges, is an hye offence againſt maieſtie,
and therefore papiſtes, that diſhonor and
diſcredit the word of God, and deſtroy the
bookes thereof, are hye offenders agaynſt
hys maieſtie.</p>
            <p>Alſo hie treaſon it is for the ſubiect to
leuie warre agayſt hys ſoueraigne, and to
deſtroy hys lande, hys faythfull ſubiectes,
and true liege people. And therefore Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes
in their perſecuting and murderyng
of Chriſtians with open hoſtilitie, haue
ſhewed themſelues hye traytors to the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
King of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Alſo where the counterfaityng of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
handes and coynes, and the clipping
and abating the value of their true coynes,
and the vttering of ſuch forged and abated
coine, is hie treaſon: what leſſe name than

papiſtes, that haue counterfait the writing

in ſtede of his worde, that clippe from
the dignitie and ſufficiencie of hys word,
that haue coyned falſe hereſies, abated true

            <p>Alſo if corrupting and counterfaityng

are they not hye traitors to God, that

publiſhers, vtterers, and cariers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode
of ſuch abhominable vntruthes?</p>
            <p>Alſo what greater offenſe agaynſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
can be, than to commaunde the
Princes ſubiectes not to beleue the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
word or writyng, nor any thyng that
ſhall paſſe by his authoritie, without ſuch
offenders confirmation and allowance:
And that the Princes word and writyng
ſuffiſeth not to direct the ſubiectes dutie,
without ſuch offenders explication and
addicions: And that ſuch offenders
may adde at their pleaſure: And that
ſuch addicions are to be holden equal with
the Princes word: And that the Princes
word muſt euer be ſo taken as ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
expound it, &amp; none otherwiſe? Then
muſt the Papiſtes, in theyr diſcredityng
the word of God, in their diſhablyng it as
not ſufficyng to the inſtruction of our
<pb facs="tcp:13707:12"/>
fayth, for the ſaluation of our ſoules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in

the word of God to their expoſitions
though directly againſt the word &amp; againſt
the ſpirite of God, nedes be accompted
hye traitors agaynſt Gods maieſtie.</p>
            <p>Alſo the greateſt honor and dignitie
that God hath and chalengeth ielouſly to
hym ſelfe among men, is the redemption
and iuſtification of man. The Papiſtes,
which draw that from God to man, from
grace to workes, as they are moſt hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and blaſphemous traitors to God
in denying his frée graciouſneſſe therin, ſo
are they moſt arrant theues to Chriſtian
men in robbyng them of the benefite
therof.</p>
            <p>Alſo if to deny that the Prince ought to
enioye the ſtile, kyngly name, and dignitie
of the realme, with al preeminences to they
ſame belongyng, be hye treaſon: are the
not hye traitors to God, that take from
God the name of our onely Iuſtifier, and
from Chriſt the title of our onely redemer
and Aduocate, and from the holy ghoſt the
office and ſtile of our onely true and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Inſtructer?</p>
            <p>Alſo ſeing that to defile the kynges wife
<pb facs="tcp:13707:12"/>
is hye treaſon, wherby the ſucceſſion of
hys crowne may growe to diſhonor and
oncertaintie: are not Papiſtes then hye
traitors that haue made the church the
ſpouſe of God, to commit ſo many fowle
ſpirituall whoredomes, with idolatries,
hereſies and yeldyng her ſelfe to be abuſed
of ſtrangers?</p>
            <p>So appeareth it euidently that, if vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latyng
of maieſtie: if denyng the kyng to
be the onely kyng and hed of hys owne

theſe, if all theſe together, be hye treaſon:
Papiſtes are hye traitors to the maieſtie

            <p>But theſe parhappes may be thought
to be but allegoricall or figuratiue trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
(ſo litle the matters of God do moue

theſe traitorous ſedes layed vp in fat ſoile

that haue in tymes paſt ben wrongfully

puniſhed by the lawes of the realme. In
ancient order of Letes, and other courtes,
they haue ben enquired vpon before trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
done to the prince. They haue had

yea in ſome caſes they haue ben, and in
ſome places and cauſes they yet be, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from the Princes power to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
They haue bene termed by ſpeciall
names of hereſies and blaſphemies: and
theyr puniſhementes, byſide temporall
peynes, haue ben extended in opinion to
the further reuenge of the eternall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,
whoes crowne and dignitie they
haue ben thought to violate. And ſurely,
if in diſcernyng which were hereſies and
blaſphemies, they had not erred: if they
had not miſtaken, and executed the true
man for the traitor: the generall care
which was pretended to mainteyne truth
<pb facs="tcp:13707:14"/>
and the church, ſtode well with the dutie
of Chriſtian Princes, as viceroyes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
iuſtly zelous for theyr ſuperior or

Lord of lordes, the true monarch of whole

true iudgement of the perſons and cauſes,
I can not well ſée howe that ſhould be a
warrant to diſburden Princes of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that zele, when it is ones ioyned
with right vnderſtandyng, no more than
the wrongfull hangyng of a true man by
miſtakyng hym for a thefe or a murderer,
ought to be a diſcharge for the very thefe
or murderer, when he is afterward taken

that is, to haue the authoritie of both

belongeth: to haue power for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience

tranſferre the crownes of kings to whom
he will: to haue lawfull power, to geue
kingdomes to prey, ſpoyle, and conqueſt,

<pb facs="tcp:13707:15"/>
to their lawfull and naturall ſoueraigne

Be not theſe hainous treaſons? And theſe
can not be denied to be the naturall and
very treaſons of all Papiſtes, that is to
ſay, of all that depend vpon credit of the
Pope, that holde hym for Gods vicar, for
Peters ſucceſſor, for whom Chriſt prayed
that hys fayth ſhould not faile, that applie
to him this title <hi>ad quem perſidia non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

Popes and Papiſtes. All ſometime moſt

Emperours, with moſt hainous repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

Sicile, Lombardie, as in other terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories

murdered, depoſed, the land geuen in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,

the ſubiect againſt his Lord, making them

and a thouſand ſuch abhominable prides of

The accurſing of king Iohn, the receauing

and feudatarie to the Pope, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb facs="tcp:13707:16"/>
his ſubiectes againſt him, the poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

to the French Kinges ſonne, the inuading
thereof by the Dolphine of Fraunce, his
ſo long poſſeſſing a great part of it, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
of the Barons to take the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
part, all the miſchiefes that fell in
all this while, were they not the good
workes of Popes and Papiſtes? The great
diuiſion of the two noble houſes of Yorke
and Lancaſter, which coſt ſo much Engliſh
bloud, that there remaineth no houſe of hie
or meane nobilitie, that hath not ſmarted
for it, ſo many foughten fieldes within the
Realme, ſo long and ſo great vncertaintie
which ſide were true men and which
were traitors, and for how many daies
or houres they ſhould be ſo eſtéemed, ſuch
deſolation and miſeries, to whom are they
to be imputed, but to the Popiſh Clergie
and Papiſtes, and among other to Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Arundell Archebiſhop of Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
that traitorouſly practiſed the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of his lawfull ſoueraigne Lord king
Richard the ſecond? But come yet to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times. How was the Quéenes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties
moſt noble father aſſalted by the
Pope and Papiſtes? His Realme was
<pb facs="tcp:13707:17"/>
interdited and geuen away to him that
could catch it. Legates, and one notable
Engliſhe traitor, were ſent about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
Chriſtian Princes, to inuade Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
to deſtroy and depoſe King Henrie,
and to take the Realme in reward for
their labour. When Charles the late
Emperour was ſetting forward againſt
the Turke, Cardinall Pole being ſent
by the Pope, made a ſolemne Oration
to him, which is yet extant in Print, to
perſuade the Emperour to turne his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
power from inuading the Turke,
and to bend it againſt King Henrie the
viij. as one worſe then any Turke. What
turmoile was raiſed then by the Northren
rebells againſt him, whereof ſome by his
elemencie (a good example) haue liued to
this day to raiſe a new rebellion? How
troubled they her maieſties moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
brother with vnhappie ſeditions?
How vexed they and how endangered they
the Realme and the Quéenes owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in her ſiſters time? What might
Charles the Emperour haue done for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie
and enlarging of Chriſtendome,
if his force that way entended had not by
Popiſh practiſe bene peruerted ſundry
<pb facs="tcp:13707:17"/>
waies and times, to the ſheding of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
bloud and waſting of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and to the ouerthrow of his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
courſe? What tempeſtes hath the
late conſpiracie of Trent blowen vp in
Chriſtendome, that can not yet be quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and all becauſe the Pope hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled
an opinion into his Papiſtes,<note place="margin">Pope tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to keepe no fayth.</note> that
Princes, if he diſpenſe with them, are
not bound to kéepe fayth and promiſe, no
not the word of a king, wherby no peace
can yet be aſſured? Whereof yet riſeth
one good admonition, to truſt them no
more, and to be well ware of them, and
ſpecially to thinke of this one particular,
that wicked perſons which haue geuen
occaſion of dangerous rebellions againſt
the Quéenes maieſtie their chiefe and
onely ſuccour and refuge, will neuer be
witholden by any reſpecte from attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or procuring to be attempted any
moſt hie and hainous treaſon and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes,
againſt our ſoueraigne Ladies
ſafetie, if auantageable opportunitie may
ſerue them, ſo long as ſuch perſons are
infected with Papiſtrie, and can thinke
the Pope hable to pardon or rather wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to reward them, yea ſo farre as they
ſhall ſuppoſe them ſelues not onely to
<pb facs="tcp:13707:18"/>
winne the kingdome of England therby,
but alſo the kingdome of heauen. It is
perilous to thinke what traitorous rage
may do, being armed with dronken ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.
It is a ſore thing to conſider
the impotentie of ambition, ſpecially
when it is ioyned with the furie of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonleſſe
loue. The common experience
is, how dangerous thoſe knottes of
théeues be where there is a woman in
the companie. Thus is it plaine, that
for as much as the Pope claimeth ſuch
wrongfull vſurpation and tyrannie ouer
kinges and realmes,<note place="margin">Ladie of North.</note> and ſith Papiſtes
holde that he ſaith true, and claimeth but
his right, and can not erre in diſcerning
it, all ſuch Papiſtes are traitors to all
kinges and kingdomes.</p>
            <p>As for the ſecond concluſion,<note place="margin">Engliſh Papiſtes traitors to the Q.</note> which
accuſeth Engliſh Papiſtes of treaſon to
the Quéenes maieſtie, it is ſufficiently
proued, for that it is as a particular with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a generall, included in the former. Yet
for the ſpeciall confirmation of it, it hath
certaine priuate and ſeuerall reaſons.
It is well knowen how they ſought her
graces death in her ſiſters time: what
practiſes, what fetches were vſed for it:
what examinations, what ſearchinges,
<pb facs="tcp:13707:18"/>
were to finde color of her deſtruction,
yea (if it be true, which is credibly ſayd)
how farre without color they proceded,
if God had not miraculouſly kept her,
to the preſeruation of this Realme and
the comfort of whole Chriſtendome. But
to make ſome demonſtration of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
to her maieſtie by reaſon, and after
to deſcend to the examples and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
let vs examine the cauſes.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Papiſtes holde, that
the Pope is head of Gods vniuerſall
Church, and that ſuch authoritie as the
Quéene claimeth in England ouer ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
perſons and in eccleſiaſticall
cauſes, as due to her highneſſe in right
of her crowne, is not due to her, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Pope, in ſo ſaying they
muſt ſay that her maieſtie claimeth an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt
tyrannicall power. And whoſoeuer
ſhall ſo ſay, though not in the ſame ſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
is an vniuſt and an errant traitor,
and can not loue her that hath pulled
downe him whom they call head of their
Church.</p>
            <p>Alſo where Papiſtes affirme the
Chirch of Rome to be the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
Chirch of God, and that, as out of
Noes Arke there was no ſafetie from
<pb facs="tcp:13707:19"/>
drowning, ſo out of the Romane Church
there is no eſcape of damnation: is there
any hope, that they ſo thinking can or
do loue her highneſſe, that hath diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
them from the body of that Chirch,
and plucked them out of that Cocklorelles
boate?</p>
            <p>Where Papiſtes holde the hereſie of
tranſubſtantiation, and the bread to be
Chriſtes naturall bodie, the blaſphemie
of Popiſhe Maſſe to be an auailing ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for quicke and dead, the Popes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
to be hable to deliuer them from
hell and damnation:<note place="margin">Traian.</note> is it likely that they
loue her whom they thinke to depriue
them of ſo great treaſures?</p>
            <p>Where the Papiſtes holde our whole
forme of ſeruing of God,<note place="margin">Papiſtes take not the Q. for Queene.</note> which forme
the Quéenes maieſtie hath preſcribed and
deliuered to her ſubiectes, to be ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,
our lawes in ſpirituall thynges no
lawes, our ſacramentes no ſacramentes,
our Biſhops no Biſhops, our Clergie
no Clergie, ſurely they thinke our Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
no Coronations, our Quéene no
Quéene, or at leaſt they are ſory ſhe is ſo.</p>
            <p>Where Papiſtes beleue a Purgatorie,
and that Maſſes, Diriges, and ſuch other
gainfull marchandiſe of the Popiſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gie,
<pb facs="tcp:13707:19"/>
be beneficiall for their frendes ſoules
and their owne, and do in the meane time
imagine that theyr fathers, grandſires,
grandames, wiues, and other frendes
ſoules lie frying in vnexplicable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
and the Quéenes maieſtie hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
from them the onely meane to releaſe
them: thinke you ſuch perſons grudge
not at her excéedingly?</p>
            <p>Where the Pope hath accurſed the
Quenes maieſtie as an heretike and ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike,
all thoſe Papiſtes which ſuppoſe
that the Pope hauing the diſpoſition of
Gods ſentence and the thunderbolt of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
in his hand, can not erre,
do alſo ſuppoſe that the Quenes highneſſe
(our Quene Elizabeth I meane) is not
lawfull Quene of England, for ſo muſt all
Papiſtes hold, that hold the Pope to ſay
true, for the Pope doth not ſo accept her.</p>
            <p>And true it is that the refuſall of the
othe for the acknowledging her Maieſties
ſupremacie ouer eccleſiaſticall perſones
and in eccleſiaſticall cauſes,<note place="margin">Papiſtes refuſe the othe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they beleue not the Q. ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the crowne.</note> is for very
good reaſons to be ſuſpected, that for the
moſt part it is but coloured with pretenſe
of conſcience for eccleſiaſticall cauſes, and
to be thought that in very deede it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
chefely vpon this poynt, that ſith her
<pb facs="tcp:13707:20"/>
Maieſtie hath bene ſuſpended, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
and declared out of the church by
the Pope, they thinke her Maieſtie not
lawfull Quene of England. For the like
example or preiudice haue the like Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes
geuen heretofore at many times,
and namely when Elizabeth Barton, that
hipocriticall harlot, ſometime called the
holy mayde of Kent, with whoſe falſe
traitorous practiſes were fowly ſpotted
and entangled More and Fiſher the new
Romiſhe Saintes, publiſhed as a reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

liued, that the Queenes Maieſties

did Papiſtes make of king
Iohn. And Papiſtes haue publiſhed that
Goſpellers, whom they call heretikes,
ought not to haue any office among Gods
people, much leſſe a kingdome.</p>
            <p>And this poynt is well to be conſidered
that they which take from the Quéenes
maieſtie the ſupremacie ouer eccleſiaſtical
perſones and cauſes, do tranſferre the
ſame iuriſdiction to the Pope, for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:13707:20"/>
yet bouch ſaued to geue it to any other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and I am ſure that after ſo many parables
and examples of bées and beaſtes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

particular church hedleſſe and deſtitute of
a ſupreme gouernor, either vniuerſall like
a monarch as they wold haue it, or ſpeciall
vnder God of eche kingdome or dominion
as Gods good diſpoſition hath ſorted it. If
then the Pope haue in theyr opinion any
eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction in England, he
muſt haue <hi>Ius excommunicandi</hi> lawfull
power and authoritie to excommunicate
in England, without which the eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
power can not ſtand. Which power
if he iuſtly haue, and hath excommunicate
and accurſed the Quéene, either by ſpeciall
name or generally vnder title of heretikes
of which ſort he eſtemeth her, then hath
he therin done <hi>pro ſuo iure</hi> as he lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

true,<note place="margin">Papiſtes draw obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from the Q.</note> then is it good to conſider what is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

from ſuch accurſed perſons not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng,

that is will affirme the Popes ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences

            <p>Wherfore theſe refuſalles to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

ſuch as ſhall haue to do with iuſtice and

thoſe that ſhall haue acceſſe into her hygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

They would be oppoſed with a few inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories.
<note place="margin">Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories for Papiſtes.</note> It would be enquired, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ſuch doinges, then to leaue ſo

being yet in ſuch eloquence perfecte

of the religion that her highneſſe ſetteth

worſe then an Infidel, not to be heard, not

ſhe beareth, but pardie that al they be ſuch
that holde the ſame religion which the
Quene doth not only hold, but alſo aduiſe,
commaund &amp; procure to be holden. They
thinke it trimly handled, if they do not
ſay that the Quene chalengeth and vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
a proude, wrongfull and falſe title,

They thinke them ſelues cunning fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,

and ſuch like, when vndirectly they implie

of pagane, Arrian, tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nous and wicked

not this ſo groſſe a mockerie offered to ſo

wherein he diuers wayes falſely
defamed King Henrie with intentes of

He named the rebellions in the

clothed with cleanly names, as enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

in both their firſt and ſecond proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But ſayth he, the houre was not yet

let vs bend all our force, policie and

Where they pray for change, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of her highneſſes reigne. Where they
hyde rebellious ſtomakes, let vs ſhew true

deceiued with flattering and erronious
pretenſe of policie, pacification, and colour

Where their truſt is in their Pope

let our confidence be in God and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,

vantage of times, that they may one day
triumph in cruel violence, let vs pray that
on this part be vſed all good policies, that
Gods offred meanes &amp; good opportunites
be not refuſed or ouerſlipped, that God
rent not the kingdome from his anoynted

long flouriſhe in the handes of his moſt
noble and vertuous handmayde our moſt
excellent &amp; gratious Soueraigne Ladie.
Thus is it euident by reaſons and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
what hartes Papiſtes beare to her
maieſtie.</p>
            <p>The third concluſion,<note place="margin">Engliſh Papiſtes traitors to England.</note> that ſuch Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Papiſtes are traytors to the realme
of England &amp;c. hath receaued two proues
already, the one in the generall treaſons
of all Papiſtes to all realmes, wherein
England and Engliſh Papiſtes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
the other in their traitorous
mindes to the Quéenes maieſties perſon
and dignitie, which is the hyeſt treaſon
that can be to the realme of England. Yet
are there ſome other particular doinges
more ſpecially to enforce it, namely the
experience that hath bene of theyr caſting
away the care of their countrie, no all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
naturall affections, to the end with all
immanitie &amp; outragious vnnaturall cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:13707:35"/>
to torment Engliſhe Chriſtians and to
ſubiect the realme to foren power for their
falſe religions ſake. I am ſure there are
enow and to many that can remember
both that they haue red in credible hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and ſéene in lamentable experience,
how the Papiſtes haue ſhewed them
ſelues ſo addicted to their ſuperſticion, and
ſo captiued to an vndue reuerence of their
tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nous Pope, that they haue for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
the care of country and of thoſe to
whome naturall dutie bound them.</p>
            <p>It is certayne that that Engliſhe man
which can be contented for Papiſtrie to
rayſe or fauor rebellion in our countrey:
to ioyne in conſpiracie with ſtrangers, to
helpe to inuade and ſpoyle our countrey:
to conuey the crowne of our countrey to
a forener: to agrée with them in faction
that offer our countrey to prey ſpoyle and
conqueſt: to colour foren ſubiections of
our countrey with falſe titles of wreſted
law, to ſubmit his fayth to that potentate
that hath accurſed and geuen our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
theyr ſoules to the diuell their bodyes
landes and poſſeſſions to them that can

ſpred all vile diſhoners agaynſt our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
to take his part as the moſt holy one,
<pb facs="tcp:13707:35"/>
that claymeth to him ſelfe from our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
prince the obeyſance of one great part
of her ſubiectes, yea &amp; of all her ſubiectes
in a great part of theyr affaires: to aſſent
that a foren vſurper ſhall by deceaueable
ſhewes of falſe religion haue ordinarie
meanes by colors of ſutes, reſortes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,

other infinite craftes to robbe our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

and to hold that he doth no more than he
lawfully may doo, which beyng an alien
a foren byſhop ſhall take vpon him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
hys curſe to the prince of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
and all the people thereof, and that he
hath power to diſcharge the ſubiectes of
the realme from their fayth and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
and hath authoritie to binde theyr
obedience to whome he will, and is able
to geue heauen to rebelles that ſhall

Engliſh Papiſt as I haue deſcribed, and
can be none other if he hold the Pope for
a true teacher and haue good opinion of
of the Popes doctrine and examples. And
<pb facs="tcp:13707:36"/>
to defend that we ought to yelde our
ſaythes or ſubmiſſion to the Pope, is in
generalitie to affirme all theſe miſchiefes
and treaſons. And ſuch as be of that

in true iudgement be ſeuered from trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torous

            <p>Let be called to minde the treaſons of

the late practiſes in Queene Maries
dayes, to bring the realme in thraldome
to the moſt inſolent and intolerable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to tranſfer the inheritance of
the crowne, with not onely diſheriting
but alſo deſtroying the true and naturall
heire: their great ſorrow, that it was not
performed: the great truſt that our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes

ſhewed them ſelues to haue of the
good ſucceſſe of Henrie the french king,
whome God tooke away before his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of thretened enterpriſes againſt
this realme. Let not be forgotten their
glorienges in their champion of Guiſe.
It is yet freſh and raw in remembrance,
how openly they vttered their as it were
applaudinges, gratulations, and cherefull
ſignifications of fauor to that ſide, euen
then when, as it is well knowen, the

foren title which was made the title and
fundation of this laſt rebellion,<note place="margin">Romiſh religion.</note> to inuade
this land, to ouerthrow the Quéenes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13707:37"/>
Let it be conſidered what good practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
theſe late Rebels haue had with ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

made lewd bokes to be publiſhed in print

<pb facs="tcp:13707:39"/>
good out of the late ill déede of horrible
murder. What ſay the Quéenes good
ſubiectes to be the cauſe, why after our
rebelles vanquiſhed, the Regent was
ſlayne, that ſhould haue bene done before
to ſerue our rebelles and their conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
turne. For ſooth their traitors there
and ſome conſpiraters here Engliſhe or
Scottiſh ſaw full well the ſincere frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the Regent to the Quéene, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandyng
all the practiſes from henſe
to the contrarie, he mynded to deliuer our
rebelles, whereby the counſelles and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
both here and there muſt haue bene
diſcloſed, they politikely prouided, by aſſent
to murder that noble gentleman betimes,
whoſe bloud added to other bloudes ſo crye
to God, as it is perilous to draw to much
into ſocietie and partnerſhyp of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
whom ſuch bloud ſo crieth. This
is the common feare of good ſubiectes: and
to feare to much rather then to little, may
be more folly, but it is leſſe fault. It may
haue leſſe cauſe, but it hath more truth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie
and fayth. Wey well if theſe be
the meanes that my lordes of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland
and Weſtmerland, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
haue ſought to bryng the vnityng of
<pb facs="tcp:13707:39"/>
realmes and crownes, and to worke the
effect of theyr proclamations both for ſtate
and religion, which doyng ſuch men brag
to be ſo beneficiall, &amp; ſith the ſame and the
titles thereof reach not ſo farre as by any
theſe meanes to make ſuch vnityng in the
perſon of our moſt noble Quene, nor ſuch
attemptes for religion and other effectes
can be atcheued with her likyng: then
what ſucceſſe is to be looked for of theyr de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes
and what marke is it to be feared
they ſhoote at? They and ſuch other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes
and ambitious practiſers may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
iuſtly and truly ſay, proteſt &amp; ſweare
that they entended not the effect of ſuch
purpoſes while her Maieſtie liueth, for it
may be that they meane peraduenture
that her hyghneſſe ſhould not lyue ſo long.
God preſerue her to outlyue all them that
haue lyued to long. This example is terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and would be profitably vſed.</p>
            <p>You can not forget how the Pope
claimeth,<note place="margin">Popiſh clergie no good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes.</note> and our Papiſtes do graunt him
the ſuperioritie ouer Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
Theyr obedience is thereby with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen
from theyr Prince, and from the
ſeruice of theyr Countrey, &amp; they exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from theyr duties to the Prince and
<pb facs="tcp:13707:40"/>
realme. Like is the referryng of all eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
cauſes to the Pope as to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
iudge and ruler. Great wrong ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is done to the Realme, great with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawyng
of the bodyes of ſubiectes from
preſence to ſerue and defende the Realme,
and great tranſportation of the treaſure:
the foule examples whereof in pilfring and
ſcrapyng within the Realme, to ſerue the
vnſatiable couetiſe of Rome, appeareth by
the many lamentable complaints in theyr
owne hiſtories, with which enormities
and oppreſſions as moſt burdenous and
perilous to the Realme, our Parlamentes
and ſpecially Conuocations, haue before
tyme found them ſelues meruelouſly agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
And yet this heuie &amp; ouerchargeable
yoke muſt be reduced agayne by our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes,
<note place="margin">Harding.</note> yea and our new angeles of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaine,
with whom the euil ſprites at home
do accord, can terme theſe intollerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions,
but a ſmall pitance or trifle to
acknowledge our good will to our mother
church, and can call the reaſonable miſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
or iuſt gronyng thereat as a niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

that ſometyme bragged that the aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyng

haue they, for they venture it at the

reigne here by their treaſon, they are lyke
to kéepe or increaſe theyr wealthes and

            <p>Let it be thought vpon how much theſe
fellowes eſteme the common knot of fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
to the Prince, whereby the peace of
the land is holden together, and eche mans
due propertie is preſerued, which beleue
that the ſame faith is diſſoluble at the will
of a foreine prieſt.</p>
            <p>Let alſo this deſcendyng gradation be
conſidered concernyng Papiſtes and their

that are not true to God: how true
they will be to their good Prince, that are

will be to any ſubiect, that are not true to
their Prince: and thereby let theyr confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drates
beware that they be not made bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,

he maketh to procede further and ſpecially
vpon them whom he knoweth in hys con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience

vicont of Melunes admonition on hys
death bed to the Engliſh barons in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the reigne of king Iohns heire.
And let them neuer ſay that they the late

God long preſerue.</p>
            <p>Let all Engliſhmen, thinke of this and

that euery perfect Papiſt doth take vpon

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
that he being in a garden vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneth
ſaying hys deuotions, might heare
them cry: all this I referre to the large,
faithfull and learned explication of that
good diligent and vertuous man Maſter
Foxe in his Booke of Actes and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of the Church, where as in a glaſſe
doth euidently appeare what nature or
any kinde, reſpect to kinne, reuerence, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
loue, or countrey, reigned or rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned
in the furious hartes of Papiſtes,
how ſmothly ſoeuer the hypocrites wyth
Crocodiles teares or wild Iriſh laughter,
do faine, flatter and abuſe thoſe in whoſe
power they be, till they haue their time of
auantage. Though the remembrance of
theſe thinges be bitter, yet is it holſome.
And therefore let it not out of their hartes
that haue harty care, and ſpecially charge
of their countrey.</p>
            <p>That clemencie and gentleneſſe can
not reclaime them from traitorous minds
while they continue in Papiſtrie,<note place="margin">Clemencie can not winne a Papiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> is as
<pb facs="tcp:13707:42"/>
plaine and as true a forme of ſpeach, as if
a man ſholde ſay they muſt nedes be tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
ſo long as they be full of treaſon, for
treaſon and Papiſtrie are vnſeparable
while they be kept vnder, euen as crueltie
and Papiſtrie are vnſeperable when they
are gotten aboue. Yet for ſome more ample
opening of the truth of this concluſion, let
vs ſomewhat more wey their qualities
with reaſonable conſideration and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of their doinges.</p>
            <p>If clemencie and benefites ſhould be
hable to reclaime them, it muſt be for ſome
regard that they muſt haue of the dutie of
thankefulneſſe, for benefites receaued of
thoſe perſons from whoſe ſincerely louing
minde toward them, and not from any
foreine enforcing cauſe, they accompt the
benefites to procede. Wherein is to be
ſearched, how much they are likely to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme
ſuch dutie, by their weying other &amp;
nere duties, and agayne how well they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
from whence this clemencie
and benefites haue proceded. For if the
hieſt and greateſt duties of kindneſſe moue
them not, then is ſmall accompt to be
made of their thankfulneſſe for temporall
commodities, or at the leaſt for bare ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:13707:43"/>
them to liue vnpuniſhed. And againe
if the ſame impunitie and other beneficiall
doinges, be thought to come enforced from
other, or craftily wonne by their owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,
or ſo to come from your ſelfe as you
could not choſe, then is your thanke fo far
loſt as there is no hope that euer any ſuch
meane can reclaime a Papiſt.</p>
            <p>Surely he that regardeth not the hyeſt
dutie, will neuer regarde the meaneſt.
The dutie of the loue or feare of God can
not hold a Papiſt from blaſphemie againſt
God. The dutie of faith &amp; allegeance to his
Prince can not kéepe a Papiſt from trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to his Prince. The dutie of deare loue
to his natural countrey can not withdraw
a Papiſt from aſſenting to, yea and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ſpoyle, deſtruction, bondage, and
alienation of his countrey, as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy
proued. The dutie of kinde and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
pitie can not ſtay a Papiſt from
murdering the feble ſexe, nor the ſilly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
infancie, nor reuerend eldeſt age. The
dutie of familiaritie in youth, of frendſhip
in grauer yeares, of continuall ſocietie du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all the life paſſed, with heapes of
mutuall commodities, can not pull backe
a Papiſt from immanitie of ſacrificing his
dereſt frendes. The dutie of honor of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb facs="tcp:13707:43"/>
to parentes, or loue of parentes to
children, remoueth not a Papiſt from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
crueltie. The dutie of entier loue
and felowſhip betwene man and wife, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
no place in the hart of a Papiſt. No
dutie of kinred, no eſtimation of learning
&amp; vertue, no good reſpect that moueth good
men to loue &amp; compaſſion, once toucheth a
ſtubburne Papiſt. Al theſe duties we haue
ſene broken, yea neglected and throwen
away by Papiſtes. And is there hope that
clemencie can ſo farre winne them, as to
hold them in truth to the Prince, from
whom they receiue it, if opportunitie
ſerue to bring them out of her danger, or
her highneſſe into their danger, which
God forbid?</p>
            <p>Whenſoeuer (which God graunt
neuer be) her Maieſtie perſon ſhould
ſtand in theyr curteſie, it is euident that
then the gate were open to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
to theyr floriſhing, to theyr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
to theyr abilities of reuengyng,
and to their perfect triumphyng. And
will they, trow you, omit all theſe that
they ſo earneſtly gape for? will they let
paſſe any occaſion that may bryng theſe?
and all in reſpect of her gracious clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and benefites? no no, that will not be.
<pb facs="tcp:13707:44"/>
It greueth me to thinke and I abhorre to
write what opportunities they are lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſéeke and vſe, hauyng now preſſed ſo
farre as they haue alreadie done with
theyr enterpriſes, ſhadowed with ſuch
hopes as theyr proclamation hath vttered.</p>
            <p>But admit kyndeneſſe were in them for
benefites where they impute them. It is
as well knowen as a common prouerb
that, where her Maieſtie of her ſingular
goodneſſe of nature (which yet were farre
greater goodneſſe, if it be directed to the
onely preſeruation of good men, and not
further ſtretched and abuſed to the cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyng
of euill and dangerous men) hath
forborne and reſtrayned execution of law
agaynſt them, which yet are the lawes
made expreſſely for her Maieſties ſafetie,
theyr ordinarie ſaying is, you can haue no

            <p>Sée the examples of theyr thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Did euer thoſe Papiſts, whoſe liues
were ſaued by good Byſhop Cranmers
meanes, who were brought vp, who were
defended, who were aduanced, who were

ſhelded from harme &amp; perill by hym, ones
requite hym with one drop of kyndneſſe?
And yet they ſpake hym faire in hys pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie.
Auayled the great liberalitie of
kyng Henry the viij. to rayſe vp any kinde
remembrance in Papiſtes, that were
great in Quéene Maryes dayes, to ſtay
them from aſſentyng to the captiuitie and
danger and ſekyng the bloud of hys moſt

well and bountifully deſerued? And yet
while they were in her preſence, they were
as deſirous as any that be now about her

            <p>And truly of this theyr great vnkynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
there is one great reaſon while Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrie
remayneth in them, Earthly
thynges muſt geue place to heauenlie, and
tranſitorie to eternall. They eſteme the
voyce of the Pope as the voyce of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

reigneth ouer them, they ſuppoſe not them
ſelues to lyue vnder her hyghneſſe as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes,

with all theyr fained ſhewe they beare to

They are ready further at theyr God the

vyle Monke that tempered a tode for hys

(as they muſt nedes be, if they think

her Maieſtie is not in Gods ſight iuſt

<pb facs="tcp:13707:46"/>
how farre they thinke they may or ought,
when they dare, to ſhonne her as a perſon

is it, trow you, to be thought that
ſuch benefites as they receiue in clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and otherwiſe, which yet they impute
to Gods preſeruing them for the holyneſſe
of theyr cauſe, or to theyr owne policies in
deceiuyng her, are hable to weye downe
thoſe depe and eternall conſiderations of
miſeries which they beleue them ſelues to
ſuſtayne by her meanes? It is not poſſible,
beyng ſo perſuaded of her right to the
croune, and of the Popes power ouer her
croune and perſon, as they be. Whyle they
thinke them ſelues true Iſraelites, the
choſen people of God, and the Pope theyr
Moſes or rather Chriſt, what accompt
make they of the prince, whom they ſerue,
other than as of Pharao? or make they any
more conſcience of withdrawyng all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
from the Prince and theyr whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
than the Iſraelites dyd of robbyng
the Egyptians, how fayre ſoeuer they

ſuch examples haue ben ſeen in her

            <p>Of lyke truth it is that Papiſtrie being
an hereſie,<note place="margin">Papiſtrie encreaſeth by lenitie.</note> or rather a bondle made vp of
an infinite nomber of hereſies, muſt nedes
haue the propertie of hereſie, to floriſh
with indulgence and lenitie. We ſée the
lyke example in the ſect of Arrians, which
vnder hereticall Emperours excedingly
encreaſced, and beyng ones condemned
&amp; reſtrayned by puniſhment, hath worne
away to a few. So farre as kyng Henry
the viij. went in reforming religion, which
was to aboliſh the primacie of Rome out
of this realme (a noble conqueſt) with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
groſſe idolatries: dyd not the ſeueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of hys lawes, the awe of hys perſon,
&amp; the dred of due execution, ſo hold downe
thoſe partes of Papiſtrie which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
that they durſt not ones ſhew
them ſelues in hys dayes? and yet in the
ſame tyme the greuous law of ſixe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
made agaynſt Gods truth, and ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly
procured by Popiſh clergie, nor yet
the earneſt inquirie, nor cruell executyng
of it by Byſhops &amp; other, could hold downe
the truth of the Goſpell, but that it brake
<pb facs="tcp:13707:47"/>
out more and more vpon them. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, that Papiſtrie and Chriſtian truth
haue two ſeuerall endes: truth reſpecteth
heauen, and Papiſtrie the world. Wherby
theyr aduentures &amp; enterpriſes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
diuerſe: the Papiſt dare boldly ſet
vpon any miſchief, where he hath hope to
auaunce hys falſehode: The Chriſtian
dare conſtantly abyde any torment to
geue witneſſe of Gods truth. And ſuch
qualitie of Gods truth haue the auncient
fathers deſcribed, when one of them cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the bloud of Martyrs the water to
water Gods garden, an other ſayth that
they encreace with cuttyng downe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in other maner haue expreſſed the
ſame meanyng.</p>
            <p>But now being vnder a Chriſtian Prince
in dayes of reſt (bleſſed be almighty God,
and long preſerued be her maieſtie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of it) as it is not mete that Gods
Church, after Iulian the Apoſtataes
maner, be perſecuted to make it encreace,
but holden downe with good diſcipline for
maners that it grow not wilde and runne
out into wantonneſſe, ſo is not the Church
of the Deuill to be mainteined and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with indulgence, winking and ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:13707:48"/>
of correction, but with good ſeueritie
to be reſtreyned, that it grow not to ſuch
rankneſſe to choke the true church in dede.

            <p>The other Concluſions following haue

is the leaſt nedefull, where thoſe for whom

            <p>The other concluſions that follow,

The effect therof, which is the
ſafe preſeruation of the Quéenes royall
Maieſtie and the realme, the auoydyng of
dangers that threaten the ſame, the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhyng
of aſſuredneſſe, boldneſſe, courage

nothyng is left to vs, but to geue thankes,
to beware that our owne ſinnes geue not
the occaſion of loſſe and change, to ſerue
dutifully and to pray deuoutely.</p>
            <p>Howſoeuer the nature of Papiſtes
hath ſhewed it ſelfe, that they are moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
traitors till they haue theyr aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and moſt cruell tormenters when
they haue obteyned it: howſoeuer it be
true that though her Maieſtie heape them
<pb facs="tcp:13707:50"/>
with infinitie benefites and cheriſh them
with vnmeaſurable and dangerous cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie,
though they crepe and crouch, and
with theyr promiſe of fayth which they

theyr zele, holdyng them contented with
glorious and falſe ſhewes of policie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
a certaine traitorous temper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
neutralitie (if they repent not their
error and change not their Religion) they

to thoſe that neuer deſerued it, they
be redy to vndermine her eſtate while ſhe
lyueth, as they did with her brother, and to

hide, or hereafter vtter theyr ſtomackes: it
is on the other ſide true that though her

yet is it ſo recompenſed and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weyed

            <p>It is we that depend vpon her, it is
<pb facs="tcp:13707:51"/>
we that thinke it ſhalbe more eaſy and
better for vs (euen in reſpect of our world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life, and benefites, though there were
not a greater proſpect beyond) to die at her
fote in her defence than to ouerliue her
Maieſtie, the ſame being expreſſed by her
enimies. Goſpellers be they, whom though
her maieſtie can by no meanes make to
ceaſe to loue her, yet by ouermuch cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
of Papiſtes, ſhe may make leſſe
ſtrong to defend her. Our caſe is ſuch as
her Maieſtie may be aſſured of vs,<note place="margin">Onely Chriſtians true to the Queene.</note> that we
ſtand for her, not only as for our Prince,
our louing ſoueraigne, our mother, our
countrey, our hauiours &amp; poſſeſſions, but
alſo for the liues, and (that moſt is) for the
ſeules of our ſelues, our wiues, our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
&amp; poſterity for euer. If any of this part
haue bene ſeduced by Papiſtes, as perhaps
there be, error I hope it is and not malice,
And as it is error, ſo is it mete to be forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as error, I meane not onely forſaken
in purſuing, but alſo in defending, ſucco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
pacifiyng and helping. For let ſuch
make their accompt to finde no truth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,

when they get aboue, howſoeuer their

preſent turne be ſerued. To late ſhall they
wiſh for the good Prince, whom their own
follies ſhall haue loſt. Let them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the policies of Charles vſed with
Maurice and other for aſſurance of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt the confederates of Smalcald.
Let them remember the Fremingham
promiſes for not altering religion. Let
them remember that the very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſers
eyther in dede ſhall not be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or will be glad to ſay they are not
able to kepe promiſe with them, or if
they would faine kepe promiſe they may
hap to be ſent after their predeceſſors.
Let them remember the keping of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictes
and word of a king in other places,
by meane of perſons ſomewhat allied.
Let them remember that them ſelues
ſhall not dare to chalenge ſuch promiſes,
no more then the Crane his reward for
pulling the bone out of the wolues throte.
Let them remember they ſhall haue to do
with ſuch as thinke not themſelues bound
to kepe faith with them nor any of our ſide,
&amp; can haue a diſpenſation at their pleaſure.
