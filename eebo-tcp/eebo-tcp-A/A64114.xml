            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have lived to see Religion painted upon Banners, and thrust out of Churches, and the Temple turned into a Tabernacle, and that Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle made ambulatory, and covered with skins of Beasts and torn Curtains, and God to be worshipped not as he is the <hi>Father of our Lord Jesus</hi> (an afflicted Prince, the King of sufferings) nor, as <hi>the God of peace</hi> (which two appellatives God newly took upon him in the New Testament, and glories in for ever:) but he is owned now rather as the <hi>Lord of
<pb facs="tcp:42503:3"/>
Hosts,</hi> which title he was pleased to lay aside when the Kingdome of the Gospel was preached by the Prince of peace. But when Religion puts on Armor, and God is not acknowledged by his New Testament titles, Religion may have in it the power of the Sword, but not the power of Godliness; and we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of this to God, and amongst them that are afflicted, but we have no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but what we must expect from the fellowship of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hrists sufferings, and the returns of the God of peace. In the mean time, and now that Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to stranger actions upon new prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; and men are apt to preferre a prosperous errour before an afflicted truth; and some will think they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious enough if their worshipings have in them the prevailing ingredient; and the Ministers of Religion are so scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they cannot unite to stop the inundation, and from Chairs or Pulpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, from their Synods or Tribunals, chastise the iniquity of the errour and the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of evil Guides, and the infidelity of the willingly seduced multitude; and that those few good people who have no other plot in their religion but to serve God and save their souls, doe want such assistances of ghostly counsel
<pb facs="tcp:42503:3"/>
as may serve their emergent needs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and assist their endeavours in the acquist of virtues, and relieve their dangers when they are tempted to sinne and death. I thought I had reasons enough inviting me to draw into one body those advices which the severall necessities of many men must use at some time or other, and many of them daily: that by a collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of holy precepts they might lesse feel the want of personall and attending Guides and that the Rules for conduct of souls might be committed to a Book which they might alwaies have; since they could not alwaies have a Prophet at their needs, nor be suffered to go up to the house of the Lord to inquire of the appointed Oracles.</p>
            <p>I know, my Lord, that there are some interested persons who adde scorn to the afflictions of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and because she is afflicted by Men, call her <hi>forsaken of the Lord</hi>; and because her solemn Assemblies are scattered, think that the Religion is lost, and the Church divorc'd from God; supposing Christ (who was a Man of sorrows) to be angry with his Spouse when she is like him, [for that's the true state of the Errour] and that he who promised his Spirit to assist his servants in their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb facs="tcp:42503:4"/>
will, because they are in trouble, take away the <hi>Comforter</hi> from them, who cannot be a comforter, but while he cures our sadnesses, and relieves our sorrows, and turns our persecutions into joyes, and Crowns, and Scepters. But concerning the present state of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> I consider, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we now want the blessings of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal communion in many degrees, and the circumstances of a prosperous &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>afflicted people, we are to take estimate of our selves with single judgments, &amp; every man is to give sentence concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the state of his own soul by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and rules of our <hi>Law-giver,</hi> not by the after-decrees and usages of the Church; that is, by the essential parts of Religion rather then by the uncertain significations of any exteriour adheren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: for though it be uncertain, when a Man is the Member of a Church, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be a Member to Christ or no, because in the Churches Net there are fishes good and bad; yet we may be sure that if we be members of Christ, we are of a Church of all purposes of spiritual religion and salvation, and in order to this give me leave to speak this great truth.</p>
            <p>That Man does certainly belong to
<pb facs="tcp:42503:4"/>
God, who, <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Believes and is baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Articles of the Christian faith, and studies to improve his knowledge in the matters of God, so as may best make him to live a holy life<hi rend="sup">2</hi> He<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in obedience to Christ worships God diligently, frequently, and constantly with naturall Religion, that is, of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, praises, and thanksgiving. <hi rend="sup">3</hi> He that takes all opportunities to remember Christs death by a frequent Sacrament (as it can be had) or else by inward acts of understanding, will, and memory (which is the spiritual communion) supplies the want of the external rite. <hi rend="sup">4</hi> He that lives chastly.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> And is merciful. <hi rend="sup">6</hi> And despises the World, using it as a Man, but never suffering it to rifle a duty. <hi rend="sup">7</hi> And is just in his dealing, and diligent in his calling. <hi rend="sup">8</hi> He that is humble in his spirit. <hi rend="sup">9</hi> And obedient to Government. <hi rend="sup">10</hi> And content in his fortune and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. <hi rend="sup">11</hi> He that does his duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he loves God. <hi rend="sup">12</hi> And especially if after all this he be afflicted, and patient, or prepared to suffer affliction for the cause of God. The Man that have these twelve signes of grace and predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, does as certainly belong to God, and is his Son, as surely as he is his creature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42503:5"/>And if my brethren in persecution, and <hi>in the bands of the Lord Jesus,</hi> can truly shew these marks, they shall not need be troubled that others can shew a prosperous outside, great revenues, publick assemblie, uninterrupted suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions of Bishops, prevailing Armies, or any arm of flesh, or lesse certain cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance. These are the marks of the Lord Jesus, and the characters of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian: This is a good Religion: and these things Gods grace hath put into our powers, and Gods Laws have made to be our duty, and the nature of Men, and the needs of Common-wealths have made to be necessary: the other accidents and pomps of a Church are things without our power, and are not in our choice; they are good to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed when they may be had, and they help to illustrate or advantage it: but if any of them constitute a Church in the being of a society and a Government, yet they are not of its constitution as it is Christian, and hopes to be saved.</p>
            <p>And now the case is so with us that we are reduced to that Religion which no man can forbid; which we can keep in the midst of a persecution; by which the Martyrs in the daies of our Fathers went to Heaven; that by which we can
<pb facs="tcp:42503:5"/>
be servants of God, and receive the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ, and make use of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and live in his love and in charity with all men; and they that doe so cannot perish.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I have now described some general lines and features of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which I have more particularly set down in the following pages: in which I have neither served nor desserved the interest of any party of Christians as they are divided by uncharitable names from the rest of their brethren and no man will have reason to be angry with me for refusing to mingle in his unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary or vitious quarrels: especially while I study to doe him good by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting him in the narrow way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, without intricating him in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths and wilde turnings of Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and uncertain talkings. I have told what men ought to doe; and by what means they may be assisted; and in most cases I have also told them why; and yet with as much quickness as I could think necessary to establish a Rule, and not to ingage in Homily or Discourse. In the use of which Rules (although they are plain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> useful, and fitted for the best and worst understandings, and for the needs of all men, yet) I shall desire
<pb facs="tcp:42503:6"/>
the Reader to proceed with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advises.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They that will with profit make use of the proper instruments of virtue, must so live, as if they were alwaies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Physicians hand. For the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of Religion are not to be applied to the distempers of the soul, as men use to take Hellebore; but they must dwell together with the Spirit of a man, and be twisted about his understanding for ever: They must be used like nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that is, by a daily care and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; not like a single medicine, and upon the actual pressure of a present ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity: For counsels and wise discourses applied to an actuall distemper, at the best are but like strong smels to an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pileptick person, sometimes they may raise him, but they never cure him. The following rules if they be made familiar to our natures, and the thoughts of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, may make Virtue and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion become easie and habitual: but when the temptation is present, and hath already seised upon some portions of our consent, we are not so apt to be counsell'd, and we finde no gust or relish in the Precept: the Lessons are the same, but the Instrument is unstrung, or out of tune.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:42503:6"/>2. In using the instruments of virtue we must be curious to distinguish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments from duties; and prudent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices from necessary injunctions; and if by any other means the duty can be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, let there be no scruples stirred concerning any other helps; onely, if they can in that case strengthen and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the duty, or helpe towards perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, let them serve in that station in which they can be placed. For there are some persons in whom the Spirit of God hath breathed so bright a flame of love, that they doe all their acts of virtue by perfect choice, and without objection; and their zeal is warmer then that it will be allayed by temptation: and to such persons mortification by Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical instruments, as fasting, sackcloth, and other rudenesses to the body is wholly uselesse; It is alwaies a more uncertain means to acquire any virtue, or secure any duty; and if love hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the corners of our soul, it alone is able to doe all the work of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be not nice in stating the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Religion; but where the duty is necessary and the means very reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in it self, dispute not too busily whether in all Circumstances it can fit thy particular; but <hi>super totam mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:42503:7"/>
upon the whole, make use of it. For it is a good signe of a great Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and no imprudence, when we have sufficiently considered the substance of affairs, then to be easie, humble, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, apt and credulous in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances which are appointed to us in particular by our spiritual Guides, or in general, by all wise men in cases not unlike. He that gives Alms, does best, not alwaies to consider the minutes and strict measures of his ability, but to give freely, incuriously and abundantly. A man must not weigh grains in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of his repentance; but for a great sin have a great sorrow, and a great se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in this take the ordinary advices; though it may be, a lesse ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour might not be insufficient: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Arithmetical measures, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of our own proportioning, are but arguments of want of Love, and of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness in Religion; or else are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of scruple, and then become dangerous. Use the rule heartily and enough, and there will be no harm in thy errour, if any should happen.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If thou intendest heartily to serve God, and avoid sin in any one instance, refuse not the hardest and most severe advice that is prescribed in order to it,

            <head>
               <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Consideration of the general instruments and means serving to a holy Life: by way of Introduction.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is necessary that every Man should consider, that since God hath given him an excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wisdom and choice an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding soul, and an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal spirit, having made him Lord over the Beasts, and but a little lower then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; he hath also appointed for him a work and a service great enough to imploy those abilities, and hath also designed him to a state of life after this to which he can only arrive by that service and obedience. And therefore as every man is wholly Gods own portion by the title of creation: so all our labours and care, all our powers and faculties must be wholly imployed in the service of God, even all the daies of our life, that this life being ended, we may live with him for ever.</p>
            <p>Neither is it sufficient that we think of the service of God as a work of the least neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, or of small imployment, but that it be done by us as God intended it; that it be done with great earnestness and passion, with much zeal and desire: that we refuse no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that we bestow upon it much time, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42503:12"/>
we use the best guides, and arrive at the end of glory by all the waies of grace, of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and religion,</p>
            <p>And indeed if we consider how much of our lives is taken up by the needs of nature, how many years are wholly spent before we come to any use o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> reason, how many years more before that reason is useful to us to any great purposes, how imperfect our discourse is made by our evil education, false prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ill company, bad examples, and want of experience; how many parts of our wisest and best years are spent in eating and sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in necessary businesses, and unnecessary vanities, in wordly civilities, and lesse useful circumstances, in the learning arts and scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, languages or trades; that little portion of hours that is left for the practises of piety, and religious walking with God, is so short and trifling, that were not the goodness of God infinitely great, it might seem unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or impossible for us to expect of him eternal joyes in heaven, even after the well spending those few minutes which are left for God, and Gods service, after we have served our selves, and our own occasions.</p>
            <p>And yet it is considerable, that the fruit which comes from the many daies of recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vanity is very little, and although we scatter much, yet we gather but little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: but from the few hours we spend in prayer, and the exercises of a pious life, the returne is great and profitable; and what we sowe in the minutes and spare portions of a few years, grows up to crowns and scepters in a happy and a glorious eternity.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42503:12"/>1. Therefore, although it cannot be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd, that the greatest part of our time be spent in the direct actions of devotion and religion, yet it will become, not only a duty, but also a great providence to lay aside for the services of God and the businesses of the Spirit as much as we can: because God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our minutes with long and eternal happiness; and the greater portion of our time we give to God, the more we treasure up for our selves; and <hi>No man is a better Merchant then be that layes out his time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and his money upon the Poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Only it becomes us to remember and to adore Gods goodness for it, that God hath not only permitted us to serve the necessities of our nature, but hath made them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come parts of our duty; that if we by direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these actions to the glory of God intend them as instruments to continue our persons in his service, he by adopting them into reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may turne our nature into grace,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>n. Epict. l. 1. c. 13.</note> and accept our natural a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as actions of religion God is pleased to esteem it for a part of his service, if we eat or drink; so it be done done temperately, and as may best preserve our health, that our health may enable our services towards him: And there is no one minute of our lives (after we are come to the use of reason) but we are, or may be doing the work of God; even then when we most of all serve our selves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To which if we adde, that in these and all other actions of our lives we alwaies stand before God, acting, and speaking, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42503:13"/>
in his presence, and that it matters not that our conscience is seal'd with secresie, since it lies open to God, it will concern us to behave our selves carefully, as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of our Judge.</p>
            <p>These three considerations rightly manag'd, &amp; applied to the several parts and instances of our lives will be like <hi>Elisha</hi> stretched upon the childe, apt to put life and quickness into every part of it, and to make us live the life of grace, and doe the work of God.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore by way of introduction reduce these three to practise, and shew how every Christian may improve all and each of these to the advantage of piety, in the whole course of his life: that if he please to bear but one of them upon his spirit, he may feel the benefit, like an universal instrument helpful in all spiritual and temporal actions.</p>

               <p>HE that is choice of his time will also be choice of his company, and choice of his actions, lest the first ingage him in vanity and losle, and the latter by being criminal be a throwing his time and himself away, and a going back in the accounts of eternity.</p>
               <p>God hath given to man a short time here upon earth, and yet upon this short time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity depends: but so, that for every hour of our life (after we are persons capable of laws, and know good from evil) we must give account to the great Judge of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42503:13"/>
And this is it which our blessed Saviour told us, that we must account for <hi>every idle word</hi>; not meaning, that every word which is not designed to edification, or is lesse pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, shall be reckoned for a sin, but that the time which we spend in our idle talking and unprofitable discoursings, that time which might and ought to have been imployed to spiritual and useful purposes, that is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for.</p>
               <p>For we must remember, that we have a great work to doe, many enemies to conquer, many evils to prevent, much danger to run through, many difficulties to be mastered, many necessities to serve, and much good to doe many children to provide for, or many friends to support, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> many poor to relieve, or many diseases to cure, besides the needs of nature, and of relation, our private and our publick cares, and duties of the world, which necessity and the providence of God hath adopted into the family of <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that we need not fear this instrument to be a snare to us, or that the duty must end in scruple, vexation, and eternal fears, we must remember, that the life of every man may be so ordered (and indeed must) that it may be a perpetual serving of God: The greatest trouble and most busie trade, and wordly incumbrances, when they are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary or charitable, or profitable in order to any of those ends, which we are bound to serue, whether publick or private, being a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods work. For God provides the good things of the world to serve the needs of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the labours of the Plowman, the skill
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42503:14"/>
and pains of the Artisan, and the dangers and traffick of the Merchant: These men are in their callings the Ministers of the Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the stewards of the creation, and servants of a great family of God, <hi>the world,</hi> in the imployment of procuring necessaries for food and clothing, ornament and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick. In their proportions also, a King and a Priest, and a Prophet, a Judge and an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, doing the works of their imployment according to their proper rules, are doing the work of God, because they serve those necessities which God hath made, and yet made no provisions for them but by their Ministery. So that no man can complain, that his calling takes him off from religion, his calling it selfe and his very wordly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in honest trades and offices, is a serving of God, and if it be moderately pursued, and according to the rules of Christian prudence, will leave void spaces enough for prayers and retirements of a more spiritual religion.</p>
               <p>God hath given every man work enough to doe, that there shall be no room for idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and yet hath so ordered the world, that there shall be space for devotion. He that hath the fewest businesses of the world, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon to spend more time in the dressing of his soul, and he that hath the most affiairs, may so order them, that they shall be a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God; whilst at certain periods they are blessed with prayers and actions of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and all day long are hallowed by a holy intention,</p>
               <p>However, so long as Idlenesse is quite shut out from our lives, all the sins of wantonness,
<pb facs="tcp:42503:14"/>
softness and effeminacy are prevented, and there is but little room left for temptation: and therefore to a busie man temptation is fain to climbe up together with his busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and sins creep upon him only by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and occasions; whereas to an idle person they come in a full body, and with open violence, and the impudence of a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse importunity,<note place="margin">Ezek 16.49. <hi>Senec.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Idlenesse is called <hi>the Sin of Sodom and her daughters,</hi> and indeed is <hi>the burial of a living man,</hi> an idle person being so uselesse to any purposes of God and man, that he is like one that is dead, unconcerned in the changes and necessities of the world: and he only lives to spend his time, and eat the fruits of the earth, like a vermin or a wolf, when their time comes they die and perish, and in the mean time doe no good; they neither plow nor carry burdens: all that they doe, either is unprofitable, or mischievous,</p>
               <p>Idleness is the greatest prodigality in the world: it throws away that, which is unvalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in respect of its present use, and irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable when it is past, being to be recovered by no power of art or nature. But the way to secure and improve our time we may pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise in the following Rules,</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Rules for imploying our Time.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. In the morning, when you awake, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome your selfe to <hi>think first upon God,</hi> or something in order to his service; and at night also, let him close thine eyes; and let your sleep be necessary and healthful, not idle and expensive of time, beyond the needs
<pb facs="tcp:42503:15"/>
and conveniences of nature; and sometimes be curious to see the preparation which the sun makes, when he is coming forth from his chambers of the East.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let every man that hath a calling, be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent</hi> in pursuance of its imployment, so as not lightly, or without reasonable occasion to neglect it in any of those times, which are usually and by the custome of prudent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and good husbands imployed in it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let all the <hi>intervals,</hi> or void spaces of time be imployed in prayers, reading, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, works of nature, recreation, charity, friendliness and neighbourhood, and means of spiritual and corporal health: ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, so to work in our calling, as not to neglect the work of our <hi>high calling</hi>; but to begin and end the day with God, with such forms of devotion, as shall be proper to our necessities.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The resting daies of Christians, and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals</hi> of the Church, must in no sense be daies of idleness, for it is better to plow upon holy daies, then to doe nothing, or to doe vitiously; but let them be spent in the works of the day, that is, of Religion and Charity, according to the rules appointed.</p>

                     <note n="*" place="margin">See Chap. 4. Sect. 6.</note>5. Avoid the company of <hi>Drunkards</hi> and <hi>busie-bodies,</hi> and all such as are apt to talk much to little purpose: for no man can be provident of his time, that is not prudent in the choice of his company: and if one of the Speakers be vain, tedious and trifling, he that hears, and he that answers in the discourse are equal losers of their time.</p>

He that is appointed to minister in holy things, must not suffer secular affairs and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did arts to eat up great portions of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: a Clergy man must not keep a Tavern, nor a Judge be an Inne-keeper; and it was a great idleness in <hi>Theophylact</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>C P.</hi> to spend his time in his stable of horses, when he should have been in his study, or the Pulpit, or saying his holy offices.

                  <hi>SECT. II.</hi> The second general instrument of holy Living: Purity of intention</head>
               <p>THat we should intend and designe Gods glory in every action we doe, whether it be natural or chosen, is expressed by S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.31.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, doe all to the glory of God</hi>: Which rule, when we observe
<pb facs="tcp:42503:20"/>
every action of nature becomes religious, and every meal is an act of worship, and shall have its reward in its proportion, as well as an act of prayer. Blessed be that goodness and grace of God, which out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite desire to glorifie and save mankind, would make the very works of nature ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of becoming acts of virtue, that all our life time we may doe him service.</p>
               <p>This grace is so excellent, that it sanctifies the most <hi>common action</hi> of our life and yet so necessary, that without it the very best acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our devotion are imperfect and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For he that prayes out of custome, or gives almes for praise, or fasts to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted religious, is but a Pharisee in his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a begger in his alms, and an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite in his fast. But a holy end sanctifies all these, and all other actions which can be made holy, and gives distinction to them and procures acceptance.</p>
               <p>For, as to know the end, distinguishes a Man from a Beast: so to chuse a good end, distinguishes him from an evil man. <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> repeated his good deeds upon his sick bed, and obtained favour of God; but the Pharisee was accounted insolent for doing the same thing; because this man did it to upbraid his brother, the other to obtain a mercy of God. <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <head>Rules for our intentions.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. In every action reflect upon <hi>the end</hi>; and in your undertaking it, consider <hi>why</hi> you doe it, and what you propound <hi>to your self for a reward,</hi> and <hi>to your action as its end,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Begin every action in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: the meaning of which is, that we be careful, that we doe not the action without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission or warrant of God. 2. That we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe it to the glory of God, if not in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect action, yet at least in its consequence; if not in the particular, yet at least in the whole order of things and accidents. 3. That it may be so blessed, that what you intend for innocent and holy purposes, may not by any chance or abuse, or misunderstanding of men be turned into evil, or made the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let every action of concernment be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with prayer,</hi> that God would not only blesse the action, but sanctifie your purpose; and make an oblation of the action to God: holy and well intended actions being the best oblations and presents we can make to God; and when God is entitled to them, he will the rather keep the fire upon the Altar bright and shining.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the prosecution of the action, renew and reinkindle your purpose by <hi>short ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> to these purposes: [<hi>Not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name let all praise be given</hi>:] and consider, [<hi>Now I am working the work of God: I am his servant, I am in a happy imployment, I am doing my

                  <p n="6">6. If any <hi>accidental event</hi> which was not first intended by thee can come to passe, let it not be taken into thy purposes, nor at all be made use of; as if by telling a true story you can doe an ill turn to your enemy, by no means doe it; but when the temptation is found out, turn all thine enmity upon that.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In every more solemn action of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, joyn together <hi>many good ends,</hi> that the consideration of them may entertain all your affections, and that when any one ceases, the purity of your intention may be supported by another supply. He that fasts only to tame a rebellious body, when he is provided of a
<pb facs="tcp:42503:22"/>
remedy either in Grace or Nature, may be tempted to leave off his fasting. But he that in his fast intends the mortification of every unruly appetite, an accustoming himself to bear the yoke of the Lord a contempt of the pleasures of meat and drink, humiliation of all wilder thoughts, obedience and humility, austerity and charity, and the convenience and assistance to devotion, and to doe an act of repentance; whatever happens, will have reason enough to make him to continue his purpose, and to sanctifie it. And certain it is, the more good ends are designed in an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the more degrees of excellency the man obtains.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If any temptation to spoil your purpose happens in a religious duty, doe not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>omit the action,</hi> but rather strive to rectifie your intention and to mortifie the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> taught us this rule: For when the Devil observing him to preach ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently, and to doe much benefit to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, tempted him to vain glory, hoping that the good man to avoid that, would cease preaching, he gave his answer only. <hi>I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther began for thee, neither for thee will I make an end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. In all actions which are of <hi>long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,</hi> deliberation and abode, let your holy and pious intention be <hi>actual,</hi> that is, that it be by a special prayer, or action, by a peculiar act of resignation or oblation given to God: but in smaller actions, and little things, and indifferent, fail not to secure a pious <hi>habitual</hi> intention, that is, that it be included within your general care, that no
<pb facs="tcp:42503:22"/>
action have an ill end; and that it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in your general prayers, whereby you offer your self and all you doe to Gods glory.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Call not <hi>every temporal end,</hi> a defiling of thy intention, but only, 1. When it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts any of the ends of God, or 2. When it is principally intended in an action of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For sometimes a temporal end is part of our duty: and such are all the actions of our calling, whether our imployment be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious or civil: we are commanded to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for our family: but if the Minister of Divine offices shall take upon him that holy calling for covetous or ambitious ends, or shall not design the glory of God principally and especially, he hath polluted his hands and his heart; and the fire of the Altar is quenched, or it sends forth nothing but the smoke of mushroms, or unpleasant gums. And it is a great unworthiness to preferre the interest of a creature before the ends of God the Almighty Creator.</p>
                  <p>But because many cases may happen in which a mans <hi>heart may deceive him,</hi> and he may not well know what is in his own spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; therefore by these following signes we shall best make a judgment <hi>whether our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions be pure, and our purposes holy.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:42503:23"/>
with a desire no greater then our necessity; and that in actions of religion we be zealous, active, and operative, so far as prudence will permit; but in all cases, that we value a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious design before a temporal; when other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they are in equal order to their several ends: that is, that whatsoever is necessary in order to our souls health be higher esteemed then what is for bodily; and the necessities, the indispensable necessities of the spirit be served before the needs of nature, when they are required in their several circumstances: Or plainer yet, when we choose any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inconvenience, rather then commit a sin, and when we choose to do a duty rather then to get gain. But he that does his recreation, or his merchandise cheerfully, promptly, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and busily, and the works of religion slowly, flatly, and without appetite, and the spirit moves like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> chariots when the wheels were off, it is a signe that his heart is not right with God, but it cleaves too much to the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is likely our hearts are pure, and our intentions spotlesse, when we are <hi>not solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</hi> of the <hi>opinion</hi> and censures of men; but only that we doe our duty, and be accepted of God. For our eyes will certainly be fixed there from whence we expect our reward: and if we desire that god should approve us, it is a sign we doe his work, and expect him our Pay-master.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He that does as well <hi>in private</hi> between God and his own soul <hi>as in publick,</hi> in Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, in Theatres, and Market-places, hath given himself a good testimony that his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42503:23"/>
are full of honesty, nobleness and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. For what <hi>Helkanah</hi> said to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Samuel,</hi> Am not I better to thee then ten sons? is most certainly verified concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God: that he, who is to be our Judge, is better then ten thousand witnesses. But he, that would have his virtue published, studies not virtue, but glory. <q>He is not just,<note place="margin">Seneca <hi>Ep.</hi> 115.</note> that will not be just without praise: but he is a righteousman that does justice, when to doe so, is made infamous: and he is a wise man who is delighted with <hi>an ill name</hi> that is <hi>well gotten.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. It is well also when we are not sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous or troubled concerning the <hi>effect and event</hi> of all our actions; but that being first by Prayer recommended to him, is lest at his dispose: for then in case the event be not answerable to our desires, or to the efficacy of the instrument, we have nothing left to rest in, but the honesty of our purposes; which it is the more likely we have secured, by how much more we are indifferent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the successe. S. <hi>James</hi> converted but eight persons, when he preacht in <hi>Spain</hi>; and our blessed Saviour converted fewer, then his own Disciples did: And if thy labours
<pb facs="tcp:42503:24"/>
prove unprosperous, if thou beest much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at that, it is certain thou didst not think thy selfe secure of a reward for your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which you might have done if it had been pure and just.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He loves <hi>virtue</hi> for Gods sake and its own, that loves and honours it <hi>wherever</hi> it is to be seen; but he that is <hi>envious</hi> or <hi>angry</hi> at a virtue that is not his own, at the perfection or excellency of his Neighbour, is not cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of the virtue, but of its reward and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and then his intentions are pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It was a great ingenuity in <hi>Moses,</hi> that wished <hi>all the people</hi> might be <hi>prophets</hi>; but if he had designed his own honour, he would have prophecied alone. But he that desires only that the worke of God and religion shal go on, is pleased with it, who ever is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He that <hi>despises the world</hi> and all its appendent vanities is the best Judge, and the most secured of his intentions, because he is the furthest removed from a temptation. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very degree of mortification is a testimony of the purity of our purposes, and in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree we despise sensual pleasure, or secular honours, or wordly reputation, in the <hi>same degree</hi> we shall conclude our heart, right to religion and spiritual designes.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When we are <hi>not solicitous</hi> concerning the <hi>instruments</hi> and <hi>means</hi> of our actions, but use those means which God hath laid before us, with resignation, indifferency and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, it is a good signe that we are rather intent upon the end of Gods glory, then our own conveniency or temporal satisfaction.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42503:24"/>
He that is indifferent whether he serve God in riches or in poverty, is rather a seeker of God, then of himself; and he that will throw away a good book, because it is not curiously guilded, is more desirous to please his eye, then to inform his understanding.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. When a temporal end consisting with a spiritual, and pretended to be subordinate to it, happens to <hi>fail</hi> and be defeated, if we can <hi>rejoice in</hi> that, so Gods glory may be secured, and the interests of religion; it is a great signe our hearts are right, and our ends pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently designed and ordered.</p>
                  <p>When our <hi>intentions</hi> are thus <hi>ballanced,</hi> regulated and discerned, we may consider, 1. That <hi>this exercise</hi> is of so universal efficacy in the whole course of a holy life, that it is like the <hi>soule to every</hi> holy <hi>action,</hi> and must be provided for in every undertaking; and is of it selfe alone sufficient to make all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and indifferent actions to be adopted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the family of religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there are some actions, which are usually reckoned as parts of our religion, which yet of themselves are so relative and imperfect, that without the purity of intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they degenerate: and unlesse they be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and proceed on to those purposes which God designed them to, they return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the family of common, secular, or sinfull actions. Thus <hi>alms</hi> are for <hi>charity: fasting</hi> for <hi>temperance: prayer</hi> is for <hi>religion: hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi> is for <hi>humility: austerity</hi> or <hi>suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> is in order to the virtue of <hi>patience</hi>: and when these actions fail of their several ends, or are not directed to their own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42503:25"/>
                     <hi>alms</hi> are mispent; <hi>fasting</hi> is an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent trouble; <hi>prayer</hi> is but lip-labour <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi> is but hypocrisie; <hi>sufferance</hi> is but vexation; for such were the <hi>alms</hi> of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee, the <hi>fast</hi> of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> the <hi>prayer</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> reproved by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> the <hi>humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Ahab,</hi> the <hi>martyrdom</hi> of <hi>Haereticks</hi>; in which nothing is given to <hi>God</hi> but the body, or <hi>the forms of Religion,</hi> but the soul, and <hi>the power of godliness</hi> is wholly wanting.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are to consider that <hi>no intention</hi> can <hi>sanctifie</hi> an <hi>unholy</hi> or unlawful action: <hi>Saul</hi> the King disobeyed <hi>Gods</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and spared the cattel of <hi>Amalek</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the best for sacrifice: And <hi>Saul</hi> the Pharisee persecuted the Church of <hi>God</hi> with a designe to doe <hi>God</hi> service: and they that killed the Apostles had also good purposes, but they had unhallowed actions:<note place="margin">

God is every where present <hi>by his power.</hi> He rouls the Orbs of Heaven with his hand, he fixes the Earth with his Foot, he guides all the Creatures with his Eye, and refreshes them with his influence: He makes the powers of Hell to shake with his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and binds the Devils with his Word, and throws them out with his command; and sends the Angels on Embassies with his decrees: He hardens the joynts of Infants, and confirms the bones when they are fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned beneath secretly in the earth: He it is that assists at the numerous productions of fishes, and there is not one hollowness in the bottom of the sea, but he shows himself to be Lord of it, by sustaining there the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

Psal 138.1, 2.</note> Gods <hi>usual way</hi> is to be present in those places where his servants are appointed <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily,</hi> to meet. But his presence there sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing but in <hi>readiness</hi> to hear their prayers to blesse their persons, to accept their offices, and to like even the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of orderly and publick meeting. For thither, the prayers of consecration, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick authority separating it, and Gods love of order, and the reasonable customs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, have in ordinary, and in a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree fixed this manner of his presence; and he loves to have it so.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. God is <hi>especially present</hi> in the hearts of his people <hi>by his holy Spirit:</hi> and indeed the hearts of holy men are Temples in the truth of things, and in type and shadow they are Heaven it self.

The Temple it self is the heart of man; Christ is the High Priest, who from thence sends up the incense of prayers, and joyns them to his own intercession, and presents all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his Father; and the Holy Ghost by his dwelling there, hath also consecrated it into a Temple;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.16. 2 Cor. 6.16.</note> and God dwels in our hearts by faith, and Christ by his Spirit, and the Spirit by his purities; so that we are also

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this manner of presence is in this life after the manner of this life, that is, imperfect, and we forget many actions of our lives; yet the greatest changes of our state of grace or sin, our most considerable actions are alwaies present, like Capital Letters to an aged and dim eye: and at the day of judgment God shall draw aside the cloud, and manifest this manner of his presence more notoriously, and make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that he was an observer of our very thoughts; and that he onely laid those things by, which because we covered with dust and negligence they were not then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.

                  <p>Now the consideration of this great truth: is of a very universal use in the whole course of the life of a Christian. All the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents and effects of it are universal. He

                  <pb facs="tcp:42503:28"/>
                  <head>Rules of exercising this consideration.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Let this actual thought often return, that God is omnipresent filling every place, and say with <hi>David, Whither shall</hi> I <hi>go from thy Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 13.7, 8.</note> 
                     <hi>or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there. If I make my bed in hell, thou art there, &amp;c.</hi> This thought by being frequent will make an <hi>habitual dread</hi> and reverence towards God, and fear in all thy actions: For it is a great necessity and ingagement to doe unblameably, when we act before the Judge,<note place="margin">Boeth 15. <hi>de consel.</hi>
                     </note> who is <hi>infallible</hi> in his sentence <hi>all knowing</hi> in his information <hi>severe</hi> in his anger <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full</hi> in his providence, and <hi>intolerable</hi> in his wrath and indignation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the beginning of actions of religion, make an <hi>act of adoration,</hi> that is, solemnly worship God, and place thy self in Gods presence, and behold him with the eye of faith, and let thy desires actually fix on him as the object of thy worship, and the reason of thy hope, and the fountain of thy blessing. For when thou hast placed thy self before him and kneelest in his presence, it is most likely, all the following parts of thy devotion will be answerable to the wisdome of such an apprehension, and the glory of such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let <hi>every thing you see,</hi> represent to your spirit the presence, the excellency and the power of God, and let your conversation with the creatures lead you unto the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; for so shall your actions be done more frequently with an actual eye to Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
<pb facs="tcp:42503:29"/>
by your often seeing him in the glasse of the creation. In the face of the Sun you may see Gods beauty: in the fire you may feel his heat warming: in the water his gentleness to refresh you: he it is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts your spirit when you have taken Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials: it is the dew of Heaven that makes your field give you bread; and the breasts of God are the bottles that ministers drink to your necessities. This Philosophy which is obvious to every mans experience, is a good advantage to our piety, and by this act of understanding, our wills are check'd from violence and misdemeanour.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In your retirement make <hi>frequent Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies</hi> or short discoursings between GOD and thy own soul. <hi>Seven times a day doe I praise thee and in the night season also I thought upon thee when I was waking.</hi> So did <hi>David</hi>: and every act of complaint or thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, every act of rejoicing or of mourning, every petition and every returne of the heart in these entercourses, is a going to GOD, an appearing in his presence, and a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting him present to thy spirit and to thy necessity. And this was long since by a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual person called, <hi>a building to GOD a Chappel in our heart.</hi> It reconciles <hi>Martha's</hi> imployment with <hi>Mary</hi>'s Devotion; Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Religion, the necessities of our calling, and the imployments of devotion. For thus in the midst of the works of your Trade, you may retire into your Chappel [your Heart] and converse with GOD by frequent addresses and returnes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Represent and offer to GOD, <hi>acts of
<pb facs="tcp:42503:29"/>
love and fear,</hi> which are the proper effects of this apprehension, and the proper exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of this consideration. For as GOD is every where present by his <hi>power,</hi> he calls for <hi>reverence</hi> and godly fear: As he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to thee in all thy <hi>needs,</hi> and relieves them, he deserves thy <hi>love</hi>; and since in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry accident of our lives we finde one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these apparent, and in most things we see both, it is a proper and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate return, that to every such demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD, we expresse our selves sensible of it by admiring the divine goodness, or trembling at his presence, ever obeying him because we love him, and ever obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him because we fear to offend him. This is that which <hi>Enoch</hi> did, who thus <hi>walked with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Let us remember that <hi>God is in us,</hi> and that we are in him: we are his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, let us not deface it: we are in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, let us not pollute it by unholy and impure actions.<note place="margin">Isa 26.12.</note> 
                     <hi>God hath also wrought all our works in us</hi>: and because he rejoices in his own works, if we defile them, and make them unpleasant to him, we walk perversly with <hi>God,</hi> and he will walk crookedly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>God is in the bowels of thy brother,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh them when he needs it, and then you give your alms <hi>in the presence of God, and to God,</hi> and he feels the relief which thou prouidest for thy brother.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>God is in every place</hi>; suppose it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be a Church: and that decency of deportment and piety of carriage, which you
<pb facs="tcp:42503:30"/>
are taught by religion or by custome, or by civility and publick manners to use in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the same <hi>use in all places</hi>: with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference only, that in churches let your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment be religious in external forms and circumstances also; but there and every where let it be religious in abstaining from spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual undecencies, and in readiness to doe good actions:<note place="margin">Jer. 11.15. <hi>secund vulg. Edit.</hi>
                     </note> that it may not be said of us, as God once complained of his people; <hi>Why hath my beloved done wickedness in my house</hi>?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>God is in every creature</hi>: be cruel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards none, neither abuse any by intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Remember that the creatures and every member of thy own body is one of the lesser cabinets and receptacles of God. They are such which <hi>God</hi> hath blessed with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, hallowed by his touch, and separated from unholy use by making them to belong to his dwelling.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. He walks as in the presence of <hi>God,</hi> that converses with him in frequent prayer and frequent communion, that runs to him in all his necessities, that asks counsel of him in all his doubtings, that opens all his wants to him, that weeps before him for his sins, that asks remedy and support for his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that fears him as a Judge, reverences him as a Lord, obeys him as a Father, and loves him as a Patron.</p>

                  <p>The benefit of this consideration and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise being universal upon all the parts of piety, I shall lesse need to specifie any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; but yet most properly this exercise of
<pb facs="tcp:42503:30"/>
considering the divine presence is, 1. an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <hi>help to prayer,</hi> producing in us reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and awfulness to the divine Majesty of <hi>God,</hi> and actual devotion in our offices. 2. It <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> produces a <hi>confidence in God,</hi> and fearlesness of our enemies, patience in trouble, and hope of remedy, since <hi>God</hi> is so nigh in all our sad accidents, he is a disposer of the hearts of men, and the events of things, he proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out our trials, and supplies us with reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and where <hi>his rod strikes us, his staf sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports us</hi>: To which we may adde this, that God who is alwaies with us, is especially <hi>by promise</hi> with us in <hi>tribulation,</hi> to turn the misery into a mercy, and that our greatest trouble may become our advantage by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titling us to a new manner of the Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. 3. It is apt to produce <hi>joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in God</hi>; we being more apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the partners and witnesses of our conversation; every degree of mutuall abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and conversing being a relation and an endearment: we are of the same houshold with God; he is with us in our natural acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to preserve us, in our recreations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain us, in our publick actions to applaud or reprove us, in our private to observe us, in our sleeps to watch by us, in our watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to refresh us: and if we walk with God in <hi>all his waies</hi> as he walks with us <hi>in all ours,</hi> we shall find perpetual reasons to enable us to keep that rule of God, <hi>Rejoice in the Lord alwaies, and again I say rejoyce.</hi> And this puts me in minde of a saying of an old religious person,<note place="margin">

               <p>Temperance consists in the actions of the soul principally: for it is a grace that chooses natural means in order to proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and holy ends: it is exercised about eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking because they are necessary: but therefore it permits the use of them only as they minister to lawful ends, it does not eat and drink for pleasure, but for need, and for refreshment, which is a part or a degree of need. I deny not but eating and drinking <hi>may be,</hi> and in healthful bodies <hi>alwaies is</hi> with pleasure: because there is in nature no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pleasure, then that all the appetites which God hath made should be satisfied: and a man may choose a morsell that is pleasant,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42503:47"/>
the lesse pleasant being rejected as being lesse useful, lesse apt to nourish, or more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with an infirm stomach or when the day is festival, by order, or by private joy. In all these cases it is permitted to receive a more free delight, and to designe it too, as the lesse principal: that is, that the chief rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why we choose the more delicious, be the serving that end for which such refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and choices are permitted. But when delight is the only end and rests it self, and dwells there long, then eating and drinking is not a serving of God, but an inordinate action; because it is not in the way to that end whither God directed it. But the choos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a delicate before a more ordinary dish is to be done as other humane actions are, in which there are no degrees and precise na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural limits described, but a latitude is indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: it must be done moderately, prudently, and according to the accounts of wise, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and sober men; and then God who gave us such variety of creatures, and our choice to use which we will, may receive glory from our temperate use, and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and we may use them indifferently without scruple, and a making them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come snares to us, either by too licentious and studied use of them, or too restrained and scrupulous fear of using them at all, but in such certain circumstances in which no man can be sure he is not mistaken.</p>
               <p>But temperance in meat and drink is to be estimated by the following measures.</p>

                  <head>Measures of temperance in Eating.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Eat not before the time,</hi> unlesse necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or charity, or any intervening accident, which may make it reasonable and prudent should happen. Remember it had almost cost <hi>Jonathan</hi> his life because he tasted a little honey before the sun went downe, contrary to the Kings commandment, and although a great need which he had, excused him from the sin of gluttony, yet it is inexcusable when thou eatest before the usual time, and thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thy hand into the dish unseasonabely, out of greediness of the pleasure, and impatience of the delay.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Eat not hastily and impatiently,</hi> but with such decent and timely action, that your eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be a humane act, subject to deliberation and choice, and that you may consider in the eating: whereas he that eats hastily, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not consider particularly of the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, degrees, and little accidents and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that happen in his meal; but may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract many little undecencies, and be sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly surprised.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Eat not delicately, or nicely,</hi> that is, be not troublesome to thy self or others in the choice of thy meats, or the delicacy of thy sauces. It was imputed as a sin to the sons of Israel, that they loathed Manna and longed for flesh: <hi>the quails stuck in their nostrils, and the wrath of God fell upon them.</hi> And for the manner of dressing, the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>Eli</hi> were noted of indiscreet curiosity: they would not have the flesh boiled, but raw, that they might <hi>rost it with fire.</hi> Not that it was a sin to eat it, or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42503:48"/>
desire meat rosted; but that when it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be boiled, they refused it; which declared an intemperate and a nice palate. It is lawful in all senses to comply with a weak and a nice stomach: but not with a nice and curious palate. When our health requires it, that ought to be provided for; but not so, our sensuality and intemperate longings. <hi>Whatsoever is set before you, eat</hi>; if it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you may eat it, be it never so delicate, and be it plaine and common, so it be wholsome and fit for you, it must not be refused upon curiosity; for every degree of that,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But if it be enquired concerning the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods and distinct significations of this crime, and when a man is said to be drunk? To this I answer, That drunkennesse is in the same mannner to be judged as sickness. As every ilnesse or violence done to health in every part of its continuance is a part or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of sicknesse: so is every going off from our natural and common temper and our usual severity of behaviour, a degree of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness. He is not only drunk that can drink no more; for few are so; but he hath sinned in a degree of drunkennese who hath done any thing towards it beyond his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per measure. But its parts and periods are usually thus reckoned: 1. Apish gestures. 2. Much talking. 3. Immoderate laughing. 4. Dulness of sense. 5. Scurrility, that is, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, or jeering, or abusive language, 6. An uselesse understanding. 7. Stupid sleep. 8. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilepsies, or fallings, and reelings and beastly vomitings. The least of these, even when the tongue begins to be untied, is a degree of drunkenness.</p>

                  <head>Rules for obtaining Temperance.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Be not often present at feasts, nor at all in dissolute company, when it may be avoided; for variety of pleasing objects steals away the heart of man: and company is either violent or enticing; and we are weak or complying, or perhaps desirous enough to be abused. But if you be unavoidably or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreetly ingaged, let not mistaken civility or good nature engage thee, either to the temptation of staying, if thou understandest thy weakness) or the sin of drinking inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Be severe in your iudgment concerning your proportions and let no occasion make you enlarge farre beyond your ordinary. For a man is surprised by parts; and while he thinks one glasse more will not make him drunk, that one glasse hath disabled him from well discerning his present condition and neighbour danger: <hi>While men think themselves wise they become fools</hi>: they think they shall tast the aconite and not die, or crown their heads with juice of poppie and not be drowsie; and if they drink off the whole vintage, still they think they can swallow another goblet. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>CHastity is that duty which was mystically intended by GOD in the law of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision. It is the circumcision of the heart, the cutting off <hi>all superfluity of naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>

I call all desires irregular and sinful that are not sanctified; 1. By the holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, or by being within the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of marriage. 2. By being within the order of nature. 3. By being within the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Christian modesty. <hi>Against the first</hi> are, fornication, adultery, and all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary pollutions of either sex. <hi>Against the second</hi> are all unnatural lusts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous mixtures. <hi>Against the third</hi> is all immoderate use of permitted beds; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, judgment is to be made as concerning meats and drinks; there being no certain degree of frequency or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion prescribed to all persons, but it is to be ruled as the other actions of a man by

               <p>
                  <hi>Chastity</hi> is that grace which forbids and restrains all these, keeping the body and soul pure in that state in which it is placed by God, whether of the single or of the married life.

Virgins must remember that the Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the body is only excellent in order to the purity of the soul: who therefore must consider that since they are in some measure in a condicion like that of Angels, it is their duty to spend much of their time in Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal imployment: for in the same degree that Virgins live more spiritually then other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, in the same degree is their Virginity a more excellent state: But else it is no better then that of involuntary or constrained Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs; a misery and trouble, or else a meer privation, as much without excellency as without mixture.</p>

Virgins must contend for a singular modesty; whose first part must be an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the distinction of sexes, or their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per instruments: or if they accidentally be instructe in that, it must be supplied with an inadvertency or neglect of all thoughts and remembrances of such difference: and the following parts of it, must be pious and chast thoughts, holy language and modest car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Virgins must be retired and unpublick: for all freedome and loosness of society is a violence done to virginity; not in its natural, but in its moral capacity: that is, it looses part of its severity, strictness and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of advantages by publishing that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whose work is religion, whose company is Angels whose thoughts must dwell in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and separate from all mixtures of the world.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. It is a duty of matrimonial chastity to be restrained and temperate in the use of their lawful pleasures: concerning which although no universal Rule can antecedently be given to all persons, any more then to all bodies one proportion of meat and drink: yet married persons are to estimate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their license according to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proportions. * 1. That it be moderate so as to consist with health. * 2. That it be so ordered as not to be too expensive of

time, that precious opportunity of working out our salvation. * 3. That when duty is demanded it be alwaies payed (so farre as is in our powers and election) according to the foregoing measures. * That it be with a temperate affection, without violent trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting desires, or too sensual applications.

And it is a sad truth, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny married persons thinking that the flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of liberty are set wide open without measures or restraints (so they sail in that channel) have felt the final rewards of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and lust, by their unlawful using of lawful permissions. Only let each of them be temperate, and both of them be modest. <hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to say, that those women to whom Nature had not been indulgent in good features and colours, should make it up themselves with excellent manners; and those who were beautiful and comely, should be careful that so fair a body be not pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with unhandsome usages.<note place="margin">

               <p>HUmility is the great Ornament &amp; Jewel of Christian Religion; that whereby it is distinguished from all the wisdome of the world; it not having been taught by the wise men of the Gentiles; but first put into a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline, and made part of a religion by our Lord Jesus Christ, who propounded himself imitable by his Disciples so signally in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as in the twinne sisters of Meekness and Humility. <hi>Learn of me for I am meek and humble, and ye shall finde rest unto your souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all the World, all that we are, and all
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42503:64"/>
that we have; our bodies and our souls, our actions and our sufferings, our conditions at home, our accidents abroad, our many sins, and our seldome virtues, are as so many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to make our souls dwell low in the deep valleys of Humility.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Arguments against Pride by way of Consideration.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Our Body</hi> is weak and impure, sending out more uncleannesses from its several sinks then could be endured if they were not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and natural: and we are forced to passe that through our mouths, which as soon as we see upon the ground, we loathe like rottenness and vomiting.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Our strength</hi> is inferiour to that of many Beasts, and our infirmities so many that we are forced to dresse and tend Horses and Asses, that they may help our needs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our wants.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Our beauty</hi> is in colour inferiour to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny flowers, and in proportion of parts it is better then nothing. For even a Dog hath parts as well proportioned and fitted to his purposes, and the designs of his nature, as we have: and when it is most florid and gay, three sits of an ague can change it into yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowness and leanness, and the hollowness and wrinkles of deformity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Our learning</hi> is then best when it teaches most humility: but to be proud of Learning is the greatest ignorance in the World. For our learning is so long in getting, and so very imperfect, that the greatest Clerk knows not the thousand part of what he is ignorant;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42503:65"/>
and knows so uncertainly what he seems to know, and knows no otherwise then a Fool, or a Childe, even what is told him, or what he guesses at, that except those things which concern his duty, and which God hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him, which also every Woman knows so farre as is necessary; the most Learned Man hath nothing to be proud of, unlesse this be a sufficient argument to exalt him, that he uncertainly guesses at some more unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary things then many others, who yet know all that concerns them, and minde other things more necessary for the needs of life and Common-wealths.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>He that is proud of riches is a fool.</hi> For if he be exalted above his Neighbours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath more gold, how much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is he to a Gold Mine? How much is he to give place to a chain of Pearl, or a knot of Diamonds? For certainly that hath the greatest excellence from whence he derives all his gallantry and preheminence over his Neighbours.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 If a man be exalted by reason of any <hi>excellence</hi> in his soul, he may please to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that all souls are equal; and their differing operations are because their instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in better tune, their body is more healthful, or better tempered: which is no more praise to him, then it is that he was born in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>He that is proud of his birth</hi> is proud of the blessings of others, not of himself: for if his parents were more eminent in any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance then their Neighbours, he is to thank God, and to rejoice in them; but still
<pb facs="tcp:42503:65"/>
he may be a Fool or unfortunate, or defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and when himself was born, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to him whether his Father were a King or a Peasant; for he knew not any thing, nor chose any thing: and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is true, that he that bosts of his Ancestors, who were the founders and raisers of a Noble Family, doth confesse that he hath in himself a lesse virtue and a lesse ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and therefore that he is degenerated.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Whatsoever other difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and thy Neighbour, if it be bad, it is thine own, but thou hast no reason to boast of thy misery and shame: if it be good, thou hast received it from God; and then thou art more obliged to pay duty and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, use and principle to him: and it were a strange folly for a man to be proud of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more in debt then another.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Remember what thou wert before thou wert begotten? Nothing. What wert thou in the first regions of thy dwelling, before thy birth? Uncleanness.

He is constant in his folly and errour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant in his manners and good purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. 4. His labours are vain, intricate, and

endlesse. 5. His fortune is changeable, but seldome pleasing, never perfect. 6. His wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom comes not till he be ready to die, that is, till he be past using it. 7. His death is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, alwaies ready at the door, but never farre off *.

                  <head>Acts or offices of humility.</head>
                  <p>The grace of humility is exercised by these following Rules:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Think not thy self better for any thing that happens to thee from without. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou mayest by gifts bestowed upon thee be better then another, as one horse is better then another, that is, of more use to others; yet as thou art a man; thou hast no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to commend thee to thy self, but that only by which thou art a man; that is, by what thou choosest and refusest.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Humility consists not in railing against thy self, or wearing mean clothes, or going softly and submisly; but in a hearty and real evil or mean opinion of thy self. Believe thy self an unworthy person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heartily, as thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest thy self to be hungry, or poor, or sick, when thou art so.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whatsoever evil thou sayest of thy self be content that others should think to be true: and if thou callest thy self <hi>fool,</hi> be not angry if another say so of thee; For if thou thinkest so truly, all men in the world desire other men to be of their opinion; and he is an
<pb facs="tcp:42503:66"/>
hypocrite that accuses himself before others, with an intent not to be believed. But he, that cals himself intemperate, foolish, lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and is angry when his neighbours call him so, is both a false and a proud person.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Never speak any thing directly tending to thy praise or glory: that is, with a purpose to be commended, and for no other end. If other ends be mingled with thy honour, as if the glory of God, or charity, or necessity, or any thing of prudence by the end, you are not tied to omit your discourse, or your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe that you may avoid praise, but pursue your end, though praise come along in the company. Only let not praise be the designe.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb facs="tcp:42503:67"/>7. When thou hast said or done any thing for which thou receivest praise or estimation, take it indifferently, and return it to GOD; reflecting upon him as the Giver of the gift, or the Blesser of the action, or the Aid of the designe: and give God thanks for making thee an instrument of his glory, or the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of others.</p>
                  <p n="8">8, Secure a good name to thy self by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vertuously and humbly: but let this good name be nursed abroad, and never be brought home to look upon it: let others use it for their own advantage: let them speak of it if they please, but doe not thou at all use it, but as an instrument to doe God glory, and thy neighbour more advantage: Let thy face like <hi>Moses</hi> shine to others, but make no looking glasses for thy self.</p>
                  <p n="9">9, Take no content in praise when it is offered thee: but let thy rejoicing in Gods gift be allayed with fear, least this good bring thee to evil. Use the praise as you use your pleasure in eating and drinking: if it comes, make it doe drugery, let it serve other ends, and minister to necessities, and to cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, lest by pride you lose your just praise which you have deserved; or else by being praised unjustly, you receive shame into your selfe, with God and wise men.</p>

                  <p n="15">15. Never compare thy self with others, unlesse it be to advance them and to depresse thy self. To which purpose we must be sure in some sense or other to think our selves the worst in every company where we come: one is more learned then I am; another is more prudent; a third, honourable; a fourth more chaste; or he is more charitable, or lesse proud. For the humble man observes their good, and reflects only upon his own vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; or considers the many evils of himself certainly known to himself, and the ill of others but by uncertain report: or he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that the evils done by another are out of much infirmity, or ignorance, but his own sins are against a clearer light; and if the other had so great helps, he would have done more good and lesse evil; or he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members that his old sins before his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion were greater in the nature of the thing, or in certain circumstances, then the sins of other men (So S. <hi>Paul</hi> reckoned himself the chiefest of sinners, because formerly he had acted the chiefest sinne of persecuting the Church of God.) But this rule is to be used with this caution: That though it be good
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42503:68"/>
alwaies to <hi>think</hi> meanest of our selves, yet it is not ever safe to <hi>speak</hi> it, because those cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances and considerations which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thy thoughts, are not known to others as to thy self; and it may concern others that they hear thee give God thanks for the graces he hath given thee. But if thou preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest thy thoughts and opinions of thy self truly humble, you may with more safety give God thanks in publick for that good which cannot, or ought not to be concealed.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Be not alwaies ready to excuse every oversight, or indiscretion, or ill action: but if thou beest guilty of it, confesse it plainly; for virtue scorns a lie for its cover; but to hide a sin with it, is like a crust of leprosie drawn upon an ulcer: if thou beest not guilty (unlesse it be scandalous) be not over-earnest to remove it: but rather use it as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to chastise all greatness of fancy and opinion in thy self; and accustome thy self to bear reproof patiently and contentedly, &amp; the harsh words of thy enemies, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the anger of an enemy is a better Monitor, and represents our faults or admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes us of our duty with more heartiness, then the kindness does, or precious balms of a friend.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Give God thanks for every weakness, deformity, and imperfection, and accept it as a favour and grace of God, and an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to resist pride and nurse humility; ever remembring that when God by giving thee a crooked back, hath also made thy spirit stoop or lesse vain, thou art more ready to enter the narrow gate of Heaven, then by

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Means and exercises of obtaining and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing the grace of Humility.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Make confession of thy sinnes often to God; and consider what all that evil amounts to, which you then charge upon your self. Look not upon them as scatter'd in the course of a long life: now, an intemperate anger, then, too full a meal: now, idle talking, and another time impatience: but unite them into one continued representation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that he whose life seems fair, by reason that his faults are scattered at large distances, in the several parts of his life, yet if all his errors and follies were articled against him; the man would seem vitious and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable: and possibly this exercise, really ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied upon thy spirit, may be useful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Remember that we usually disparage others upon slight grounds, and little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; and towards them one flie is enough to spoil a whole box of ointment: and if a man be highly commended, we think him sufficiently lessened, if we clap one sinne or solly, or infirmity into this account: Let us
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42503:70"/>
therefore be just to our selves, since we are so severe to others, and consider, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever good any one can think or say of us, we can tell him of hundreds of base and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and foolish actions, any one of which were enough (we hope) to destroy anothers reputation: Therefore let so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be sufficient to destroy our over-high thoughts of our selves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When thy Neighbour is cryed up by publick fame, and popular noises; that we may disparage and lessen him, we cry out that the people is a Heard of unlearned and ignorant persons,<note place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4. We change our opinion of others by their kindness or unkindness towards us. If he be my Patron and bounteous, he is wise, he is noble, his faults are but warts, his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are mountanous: but if he proves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde or rejects our importunate suit, then he is ill-natured, covetous, and his free meal is called gluttony; that which before we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>civility,</hi> is now very <hi>drunkenness,</hi> and all he speakes is flat and dull, and ignorant as a swine: This indeed is unjust towards others, but a good instrument, if we turn the edge of it upon our selves: we use our selves ill, abusing our selves with false principles, cheating our selves with lies and pretences,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42503:70"/>
stealing the choice and election from our wils, placing voluntary ignorance in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, denying the desires of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, setting up a faction against every noble and just desire; the lest of which because we should resent up to reviling the injurious person, it is but reason we should at least not flatter our selves with fond and too kinde opinions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Every day call to minde some one of thy foulest sins, or the most shameful of thy disgraces, or the indiscreetest of thy actions, or any thing that did then most trouble thee, and apply it to the present swelling of thy spirit and opinion, and it may help to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Pray often for his grace with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of gesture and passion of desire, and in thy devotion interpose many acts of humility by way of confession and addresse to God, and reflection upon thy self.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Avoid great Offices and imployments, and the noises of wordly honour. For in those states many times, so many ceremonies and circumstances will seem necessary, as will destroy the sobriety of thy thoughts. If the number of thy servants be fewer, and their observances lesse, and their reverences lesse solemn, possibly they will seem lesse then thy dignity: and if they be so much and so many it is likely they will be too big for thy spirit. <note place="margin">

For supposing it might be good for others, yet it is not good for thee: they
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42503:71"/>
may have encouragement in noble things from thee, and by the same instrument thou mayest thy self be tempted to pride and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: And certain it is, GOD is as much glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by thy example of humility in a low or temperate condition, as by thy bounty in a great and dangerous.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Make no reflex acts upon thy own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, nor upon any other grace with which GOD hath enriched thy soul. For since GOD oftentimes hides from his Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the sight of those excellent things by which they shine to others (though the dark side of the Lantern be toward themselves) that he may secure the grace of humility, it is good that thou doe so thy self: and if thou beholdest a grace of GOD in thee, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to give him thanks for it, that thou may not boast in that which is none of thy own: and consider how thou hast sullied it, by handling it with dirty fingers, with thy own imperfections, and with mixture of unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some circumstances. Spiritual pride is very dangerous, not only by reason it spoils so many graces by which we drew nigh unto the Kingdome of GOD, but also because it so frequently creeps upon the spirit of holy persons. For it is no wonder for a Begger to call himself poor; or a drunkard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that he is no sober person: But for a holy person to be humble; for one whom all men esteem a Saint, to fear l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

guided by Tutors, and make himself subject to discipline like the meanest of his servants.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Often meditate upon the effects of Pride on one side, and Humility on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 1. That Pride is like a Canker, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes the beauty of the fairest flowers, the most excellent gifts and graces: but Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity crowns them all. Secondly,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.25</note> That Pride is a great hindrance to the perceiving the things of GOD and Humility is an excellent preparative and instrument of spiritual wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Thirdly, That Pride hinders the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of our prayers, but <hi>Humility pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Fifthly, That Humility is the most certain way to real honour, and Pride is ever affronted or despised. Sixthly, That Pride turned <hi>Lucifer</hi> into a Devil, and Humility exalted the Son of God above every Name, and placed him eternally at the right hand of his Father. Seventhly, That <hi>GOD resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth the proud,</hi> professing open defiance and hostility against such persons,<note place="margin">Iames 4.6.</note> but <hi>giveth grace to the humble,</hi> * Grace and pardon, * remedy and relief against misery and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, * content in all conditions, * tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of spirit, * patience in afflictions, * love abroad, * peace at home, * and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter freedome from contention and * the sin of censuring others, * and the trouble of being censured themselves.

reproved, because himself hath cast the first stone at himself, and therefore wonders not that others are of his minde.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Remember that the blessed Saviour of the world hath done more to prescribe, and transmit,<note place="margin">John 13.15.</note> and secure <hi>this grace</hi> then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: his whole life being a great continued example of humility: a vast descent from the glorious bosome of his Father to the womb of a poor maiden, to the form of a servant, to the miseries of a sinner, to a life of labour, to a state of poverty, to a death of malefactors, to the grave of death, and the intolerable calamities which we deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: and it were a good designe and yet but reasonable, that we should be as humble in the midst of our greatest imperfections and basest sins, as Christ was in the midst of his fulness of the Spirit, great wisdom, perfect life, and most admirable virtues.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Drive away all flatterers from thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and at no hand endure them; for he that endures himself so to be abused by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other is not only a fool for entertaining the mockery, but loves to have his own opinion of himself to be heightned and cherished.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Never change thy imployment for the sudden coming of another to thee: But if modesty permits or discretion, appear to him that visits thee the same that thou wert to God and thy self in thy privacy. But if thou wert walking or sleeping, or in any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent imployment or retirement, snatch not up a book to seem studious, nor fall on thy knees to seem devout, nor alter any thing to make him believe thee better imployed then thou wert.</p>

                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:42503:72"/>13. To the same purpose it is of great use that he who would preserve his humility, should choose some spiritual person to whom he shall oblige himself to discover his very thoughts, and fancies; every act of his and all his entercourse with others in which there may be danger; that by such an openness of spirit, he may expose every bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>st of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, every idle thought to be chastened and lessened by the rod of spiritual discipline: and he that shall finde himself tied to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse every proud thought, every vanity of his spirit, will also perceive they must not dwell with him, nor finde any kindness from him: and besides this, the nature of pride is so shameful, and unhandsome, that the very discovery of it is a huge mortification and means of suppressing it. A man would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to be told that he enquires after the faults of his last Oration or action on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be commended: and therefore when the man shall tell his spiritual Guide the same shameful story of himself, it is very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he will be humbled, and heartily ashamed of it.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Let every man suppose what opinion he should have of one that should spend his time in playing with drumsticks and cockle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shels, and that should wrangle all day long with a little boy for pins, or should study hard and labour to cousen a childe of his gauds, and who would run into a river deep and dangerous with a great burden upon his back, even then when he were told of the danger and earnestly importuned not to doe it: and let him but change the Instances and

                        </gap> which profits not</hi>; who knowing the laws of God, the rewards of virtue, the cursed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of sin, that it is an evil spirit that tempts him to it, a Devil, one that hates him, that longs extreamly to ruine him, that it is his own destruction that he is then working, that the pleasures of his sinne are base and brutish, unsatisfying in the enjoyment, soon over, shameful in their story, bitter in the memory, painful in the effect here, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable hereafter, and for ever: yet in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite of all this, he runs foolishly into his sin and his ruine, meerly because he is a fool, and winks hard, and rushes violently like a horse into the battel, or like a mad man to his death. He that can think great and good things of such a person, the next step may court the rack for an instrument of pleasure, and admire a swine for wisdom, and go for counsel to the prodigal and trifling gras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper.</p>
                  <p>After the use of these and such like instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and considerations, if you would trie how your soul is grown; you shall know that humility like the root of a goodly tree is thrust very farre into the ground by these goodly fruits which appear above ground.</p>

                  <p>Every man hath in his own life sins e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, in his own minde trouble enough, in his own fortune evils enough, and in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his offices failings more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to entertain his own enquiry: so that curiosity after the affairs of others, cannot be without envy and an evil minde. What is it to me if my Neighbours Grandfather were a Syrian, or his Grandmother illegitimate, or that another is indebted five thousand pounds, or whether his wife be expensive? But commonly curious persons (or as the Apostles phrase is) <hi>busie-bodies</hi> are not sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous, or inquisitive into the beauty and order of a well-governed family, or after the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42503:75"/>
virtues of an excellent person; but if there be any thing for which men keep locks and barres and porters, things that blush to see the light, and either are shameful in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or private in nature, these things are their care and their business. * But if great things will satisfie our enquiry, the course of the Sun and Moon, the spots in their faces, the Firmament of Heaven, and the supposed Orbs, the ebbing and flowing of the Sea are work enough for us: or if this be not, let him tell me, whether the number of the starres be even or odde, and when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be so? since some ages have discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red new starres which the former knew not, but might have seen, if they had been where now they are fixed. * If these be too trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, search lower, and tell me, why this turf this year brings forth a Daisie, and the next year a Plantane: why the apple bears his seed in his heart, and wheat bears it in his head: let him tell, why a graff taking nourishment from a crab stock shall have a fruit more noble then its nurse and parent: let him say, why the best of oyl is at the top, the best of wine in the middle, and the best of honey at the bottom, otherwise then it is in some li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors that are thinner, and in some that are thicker? But these things are not such as please busie-bodies; They must feed upon Tragedies, and stories of misfortunes and crimes; and yet tell them ancient stories of the ravishment of chast maidens, or the debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of nations, or the extreme poverty of learned persons, or the persecutions of the old Saints, or the changes of government, and sad
<pb facs="tcp:42503:75"/>
accidents hapning in Royal families amongst the <hi>Arsacidae,</hi> the <hi>Caesars,</hi> the <hi>Ptolemies,</hi> these were enough to scratch the itch of knowing sad stories. But unlesse you tell them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>sad and new,</hi> something that is done within the bounds of their own knowledge or relation, it seems tedious and unsatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which showes plainly it is an evil spirit: envie and idleness married together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got curiosity. Therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> rarely well compares curious and inquisitive ears to the execrable gates of cities, out of which only Malefactors, and Hangmen and Tragedies passe, nothing that is chast or holy. * If a Physician should go from house to house un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent for, and enquire what woman hath a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in her bowels, or what man hath a fistula in his colick gut, though he could pretend to cure it, he would be almost as unwelcome as the disease it self: and therefore it is inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane to enquire after crimes and dysasters without pretence of amending them, but only to discover them. We are not angry with Searchers and Publicans when they look only on publick merchandise; but when they break open trunks, and pierce vessels, and unrip packs, and open sealed letters.</p>
                  <p>Curiosity is the direct incontinency of the spirit: and adultery it self in its principle is many times nothing but a curious inquisition after, and envying of another mans inclosed pleasures: and there have been many who refused fairer objects that they might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish an inclosed woman, from her retirement and single possessour. But these inquisitions are seldome without danger, never without
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42503:76"/>
baseness; they are neither just, nor honest, nor delightful, and very often uselesse to the curious inquirer. For men stand upon their guards against them, as they secure their meat against Harpyes and Cats, laying all their counsels and secrets out of their way; or as men clap their garments close about them when the searching and saucy winds would discover their nakedness: as knowing that what men willingly hear, they doe willingly speak of. Knock therefore at the dore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you enter upon your neighbours priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and remember that there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between entring into his house, and looking into it.</p>

               <p>Virtues and Discourses are like Friends, necessary in all fortunes; but those are the best which are Friends in our sadnesses, and support us in our sorrows, and sad acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: and in this sense, no man that is vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous can be friendlesse; nor hath any man
<pb facs="tcp:42503:79"/>
reason to complain of the Divine Providence, or accuse the publick disorder of things, or his own infelicity, since God hath appointed one remedy for all the evils in the World, and that is, a contented spirit: For this alone makes a man passe through fire, and not be scorched; through Seas, and not be drowned, through hunger and nakedness, and want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For since all the evil in the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the disagreeing between the object and the appetite, as when a man hath what he desires not, or desires what he hath not, or desires amisse; he that composes his spirit to the present accident, hath variety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances for his virtue, but none to trouble him, because his desires enlarge not beyond his present fortune: and a wise man is placed in the variety of chances like the Nave or Centre of a wheel, in the midst of all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolutions and changes of posture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violence or change, save that it turns gently in complyance with its changed parts, and is indifferent which part is up and which is down; for there is some virtue or other to be exercised what ever happens, either pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or thanksgiving, love or fear, modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or humility, charity or contentedness, and they are every one of them equally in order to his great end, and immortal felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and beauty is not made by white or red, by black eyes and a round face by a straight body and a smooth skin; but by a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the fancy: No rules can make ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, our mindes and apprehensions make that; and so is our felicity; and we may be reconciled to poverty &amp; a low fortune, if we
<pb facs="tcp:42503:79"/>
suffer contentedness and the grace of God to make the proportions. For no man is poor that does not think himself so: But if in a full fortune, with impatience he desires more, he proclaims his wants and his beggerly condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">

And my Patron that hath given me a Farm is freer to me then if he gives a loaf ready baked. But however, all these gifts come from him, and therefore

it is fit he should dispence them as he please; and if we murmure here, we may at the next melancholy be troubled that God did not make us to be Angels, or Stars.

Are we any thing but what we are from him, and shall there be a mutiny among the flocks and herds, because their Lord or their Shepherd chooses their pastures, and suffers them not to wander into Deserts and unknown waies? If we choose, we doe it so foolishly that we cannot like it long, and most commonly not at all: but God who can doe what he please, is wise to choose safely for us, affectionate to comply with our needs, and powerful to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute all his wise decrees. Here therefore is the wisdome of the contented man, to let God choose for him: for when we have given up our wills to him, and stand in that station of the battel where our great General hath placed us, our spirits must needs rest while our conditions have for their security the power, the wisdom, and the charity of God.</p>

This is the charity of Christian Philosophy, which expounds the sense of the Divine providence fairly, and reconciles us to it by a charitable construction: and we may as well refuse all physick if we consider it only as unpleasant in the tast, and we may finde fault with the rich valleys of <hi>Thasus,</hi> because they are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled with sharp mountains: but so also we may be in charity with every unpleasant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, because though it tast bitter it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for health and medicine.</p>
               <p>If therefore thou fallest from thy imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in publick, take sanctuary in an honest
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42503:82"/>
retirement, being indifferent to thy gain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or thy safety at home: If thou art out of favour with thy Prince, secure the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>King of kings,</hi> and then there is no harm come to thee: and when <hi>Zeno Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiensis</hi> lost all his goods in a storm, he retired to the studies of Philosophy, to his short cloak, and a severe life, and gave thanks to fortune for his prosperous mischance. When the North-winde blows hard, and it rains sadly, none but fools sit down in it and crie: wise people defend themselves against it with a warm garment, or a good fire, and a drie roof: when a storm of a sad mischance beats upon our spirits, turn it into some advantage by observing where it can serve another end, either of religion or prudence, of more safety or lesse envie: it will turn into something that is good, if we list to make it so: at least it may make us weary of the worlds vanity, and take off our confidence from uncertain riches, and make our spirits to dwell in those regions, where content dwels essentially: if it does any good to our souls, it hath made more then sufficient recompense for all the temporal affliction. He that threw a stone at a dog, and hit his cruel stepmother, said, that although he intended it otherwise, yet the stone was not quite lost: and if we fail in the first designe, if we bring it home to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther equally to content us, or more to profit us, then we have put our conditions past the power of chance; and this was called in the old Greek Comedy <hi>a being revenged on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune by becoming Philosophers,</hi> and turning the chance into reason or religion: for so a
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42503:83"/>
wise man shall overrule his starres, and have a greater influence upon his own content, then all the constellations and planets of the firmament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Never compare thy condition with those above thee; but to secure thy content, look upon those thousands with whom thou wouldest not for any interest change thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and condition. A souldier must not think himself unprosperous, if he be not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful as the son of <hi>Philip,</hi> or cannot grasp a fortune as big as the Roman Empire: Be content that thou art not lessened as was <hi>Pyrrbus</hi>: or if thou beest, that thou art not routed like <hi>Crassus</hi>: and when that comes to thee, it is a great prosperity, that thou art not cag'd and made a spectacle like <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a fine thing (thou thinkest) to be carried on mens shoulders: but give God thanks that thou art not forced to carry a rich fool upon thy shoulders: as those poor men doe whom thou beholdest. There are but few Kings in mankinde, but many thousands who are very miserable, if compared to thee. However it is a huge folly rather to grieve for the good of others, then to rejoyce for that good which God hath given us of our own.</p>
               <p>And yet there is no wise or good man that would change persons or conditions intirely
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42503:83"/>
with any man in the world. It may be he would have one mans wealth added to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or the power of a second, or the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a third, but still he would receive these into his own person, because he loves that best, and therefore esteems it best, and therefore over values all that which he is, before all that which any other man in the world can be. Would any man be <hi>Dives</hi> to have his wealth, or <hi>Iudas</hi> for his office, or <hi>Saul</hi> for his kingdome, or <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solon</hi> for his beauty, or <hi>Achitophel</hi> for his policy? It is likely he would with all these, and yet he would be the same person still. For every man hath desires of his own, and objects just fitted to them, without which he cannot be, unlesse he were not himself. And let every man that loves himself so well as to love himself before all the world, consider if he have not something, for which in the whole he values himself faire more then he can value any man else. There is therefore no reason to take the finest feathers from all the winged nation to deck that bird, that thinks already she is more valuable then any the inhabitants of the ayre. Either change all or none. Cease to love your self best, or be content with that portion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and blessing for which you love your self so well.</p>

It conduces much to our content, if we passe by those things which happen to our trouble, and <hi>consider that which is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and prosperous,</hi> that by the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the better, the worse may be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out: and at the worst you have enough
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42503:84"/>
to keep you alive, and to keep up, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your hopes of Heaven. If I be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown in my suit at Law, yet my house is left me still and my land: or I have a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wife, or hopeful children, or kinde freinds, or good hopes: If I have lost one childe, it may be I have two or three still left me; <hi>or else reckon the blessings which already you have received,</hi> and therefore be pleased in the change and variety of affairs to receive <hi>evil from the hand of God as well as good. Antipater</hi> of Tarsus used this art to support his sorrows on his death-bed, and reckoned the good things of his past life, not forgetting to recount it as a blessing, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that God took care of him, that he had a prosperous journey from Cilicia to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.<note place="margin">

designed to the inheritance of Jesus: and what dost thou think concerning thy great fortune, thy lot and portion of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Doest thou think thou shalt be saved or damned? Indeed if thou thinkest thou shalt perish, I cannot blame thee to be sad, sad till thy heart-strings crack: but then why art thou troubled at the losse of thy money? what should a damned man doe with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which in so great a sadness it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for him to enjoy? Did ever any man upon the rack, afflict himself because he had received a crosse answer from his Mistresse? or call for the particulars of a purchase upon the gallows? It thou doest really believe thou shalt be damned, I doe not say it will <hi>cure</hi> the sadness of thy poverty, but it will <hi>swallow</hi> it up. * But if thou believest thou shalt be saved, consider how great is that joy, how infinite is that change, how unspeakable is the glory, how excellent is the recompense for all the sufferings in the world, if they were all laden upon the spirit? So that let thy condition be what it will, if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderest thy own present condition, and compare it to thy future possibility, thou canst not feel the present smart of a crosse fortune to any great degree, either because thou hast a farre bigger sorrow, or a farre bigger joy. Here thou art but a stranger travelling to thy Countrey, where the glories of a kingdome are prepared for thee, it is therefore a huge folly to be much afflicted because thou hast a lesse convenient Inne to lodge in by the way.</p>
               <p>But these arts of <hi>looking forwards and

If you misse an Office for which you stood Candidate, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that you are quit of the cares and the envy of it, you still have all those excellencies which rendred you capable to receive it, and they are better then the best Office in the Common-wealth.

are from within us: and from our selves also we must look for our greatest good; for God is the Fountain of it, but reaches it to us by our owne hands; and when all things look sadly round about us, then only we shall finde how excellent a fortune it is to have GOD to our friend; and of all friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships that only is created to support us in our needs. For it is sin that turns an Ague into a Feaver, and a Feaver to the Plague, feare into dispair, anger into rage, and losse into madness, and sorrow to amazement and confusion: but if either we were innocent, or else by the sadness are made penitent, we are put to school, or into the Theatre, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to learn how, or else actually to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat for a Crown; the accident may serve an end of mercy, but is not a messenger of wrath.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Consider that the universal providence of God hath so ordered it that the good things of Nature and Fortune are divided, that we may know how to bear our own &amp; relieve each others wants and imperfections. It is not for a Man, but for a God to have all excellencies and all felicities. He sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports my poverty with his wealth, I counsel
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42503:90"/>
and instruct him with my learning and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. He hath many friends, I many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: He hath no heir, I have no inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: and any one great blessing together with the common portions of Nature and necessity is a fair fortune, if it be but health or strength, or the swiftness of <hi>abimaaz.</hi> For it is an unreasonable discontent to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that I have not so good Cokes, or Dogs, or Horses as my Neighbour, being more troubled that I want one thing that I need not, then thankful for having received all that I need. <hi>Nero</hi> had this disease, that he was not content with the fortune of the whole Empire, but put the Fidlers to death for being more skilful in the trade then he was: and <hi>Dionysius</hi> the elder, was so angry at <hi>Philoxenus</hi> for singing, and with <hi>Plato</hi> for disputing better then he did, that he sold <hi>Plato</hi> a Slave into <hi>Aegina,</hi> and condemned the other to the Quarries.</p>
                  <p>This consideration is to be enlarged by adding to it that there are some instances of fortune and a fair condition that cannot stand with some others, but if you desire this, you must lose that, and unlesse you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with one, you lose the comfort of both. If you covet Learning, you must have leisure and a retired life: if to be a Politician, you must go abroad and get experience and doe all businesses, and keep all company, and have no leisure at all. If you will be rich, you must be frugal: if you will be popular, you must be bountifull: If a Philosopher, you must despise riches. The Greek that designed to make the most exquisite picture that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42503:90"/>
could be imagined, fancied the eye of <hi>Chione,</hi> and the hair of <hi>Paegnium,</hi> and <hi>Tarsia</hi>'s lip, <hi>Philenium</hi>'s chin, and the forehead of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> and set all these upon <hi>Milphidippa</hi>'s neck, and thought that he should out doe both Art and Nature. But when he came to view the proportions, he found that what was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in <hi>Tarsia</hi> did not agree with the other excellency of <hi>Philenium</hi>; and although singly they were rare pieces, yet in the whole they made a most ugly face. The dispersed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and blessings of many men, if given to one, would not make a handsome, but a monstrous fortune. Use therefore that faculty which Nature hath given thee, and thy education hath made actual, and thy calling hath made a duty: but if thou desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to be a Saint, refuse not his persecution: If thou wouldest be famous as <hi>Epaminondas</hi> or <hi>Fabricius,</hi> accept also of their poverty, for that added lustre to their persons and envy to their fortune, and their virtue without it coul not have been so excellent, Let <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shorion</hi> sleep quietly with his old rich Wife: and let <hi>Medius</hi> drink on with <hi>Alexander</hi>: and remember thou canst not have the riches of the first, unlesse you have the old Wife too; nor the favour which the second had with his Prince, unlesse you buy it at his price, that is, lay thy sobriety down at first,<note place="margin">

                  <p n="5">5. Consider that afflictions are oftentimes the occasions of great temporal advantages: and we must not look upon them as they sit down heavily upon us, but as they serve some of Gods ends, and the purposes of universal Providence: And when a Prince sights just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and yet unprosperously, if he could see all those reasons for which God hath so ordered it, he would think it the most reasonable thing in the world, and that it would be very ill to have it otherwise. If a man could have opened one of the pages of the Divine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and could have seen the event of <hi>Josephs</hi> being sold to the Merchants of <hi>Amaleck</hi> he might with much reason have dried up the young mans tears: and when Gods purposes are opened in the events of things, as it was in the case of <hi>Joseph,</hi> when he sustained his Fathers family and became Lord of Egypt, then we see what ill judgment we made of things, and that we were passionate as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and transported with sense and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken interests. The case of <hi>Themitocles</hi> was almost like that o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Joseph,</hi> for being banished into Egypt, he also grew in favour with the King, and told his wife <hi>He had been undone, unlesse he had been undone.</hi> For God esteems it one of his glories that he brings good out of evil, and therefore it were but reason we
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42503:93"/>
should trust God to governe his own world as he pleases: and that he should patiently <hi>wait till the change cometh,</hi> or the reason be discovered.</p>
                  <p>And this consideration is also of great use to them who envy at the prosperity of the wicked, and the successe of Persecutors, and the baites of fishes, and the bread of dogs. God fails not to sow blessings in the long furrows which the plowers plow upon the back of the Church: and this successe which troubles us will be a great glory to God, and a great benefit to his Saints and servants, and a great ruine to the Persecutors, who shall have but the fortune of <hi>Theramenes</hi> one of the thirty Tyrants of Athens, who scaped when his house fell upon him, and was short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after put to death with torments by his Collegues in the Tyranny.</p>
                  <p>To which also may be added that the great evils which happen to the best and wisest men are one of the great arguments, upon the strength of which we can expect felicity to our souls, and the joyes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world. And certainly they are then very tolerable and eligible, when with so great advantages they minister to the faith and hope of a Christian. But if we consider what unspeakable tortures are provided for the wicked to all eternity, we should not be troubled to see them prosperous here, but rather wonder that their portion in this life is not bigger, and that ever they should be sick or crossed, or affronted, or troubled with the contradiction and disease of their own vices, since if they were fortunate beyond

their own ambition it could not make them recompense for one hours torment in Hell, which yet they shall have for their eternal portion.</p>
                  <p>After all these considerations deriving from sense and experience, grace and reason, there are two remedies still remaining, and they are <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Time.</hi>

It may be he hath laid up in the corn that shall feed thee in the granary of thy Brother; or will clothe thee with his wool; he enabled Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to pay his Gabel, by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of a fish; and <hi>Elias</hi> to be waited on by a crow, who has both his minister, and his steward for provisions: and his Holy Son rode in triumph upon an asse that grazed in another mans postures. And if God gives to him the dominion &amp; reserves the use to thee, thou hast the better half of the two; but the
<pb facs="tcp:42503:99"/>
charitable man serves God and serves thy need; and both joyn to provide for thee, and God blesses both. But if he takes away the flesh-pots from thee, he can also alter the appetite, and he hath given thee power and commandment to restrain it: and if he lessens the revenue, he will also shrink the necessity; or if he gives but a very little, he will make it go a great way: or if he sends thee but course diet, he will blesse it and make it healthful, and can cure all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of thy poverty by giving thee pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the grace of contentedness. For the grace of God secures you of provisions, and yet the grace of God feeds and supports the spirit in the want of provisions: and if a thin table be apt to enfeeble the spirits of one used to feed better, yet the cheerfulness of a spirit that is blessed will make a thin table become a delicacy, if the man was as well taught as he was fed, and learned his duty when he received the blessing. Poverty therefore is in some senses eligible and to be preferred before riches, but in all senses it is very tolerable.</p>

And the more tender our spirts are made by Religion, the more easie we are to let in grief, if the cause be innocent, and be but in any sense twisted with piety and due af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. * To cure which we may consider that all the world must die, and therefore to be impatient at the death of a person co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whom it was certain and known that he must die, is to mourn because thy friend or childe was not born an Angel, and when thou hast a while made thy self miserable by an importunate and uselesse grief, it may be thou shalt die thy self, and leave others to their choice whether they will mourn for thee or no: but by that time it will appear how impertinent that greif was which served no end of life, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in thy own funeral. But what great matter is it, if sparkes fly upward, or a stone falls into a pit, if that which was combustible be burned, or that which was liquid be melted, or that which is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal doe die? It is no more then a man does every day; for every night death hath gotten possession of that day, and we shall never live that day over again; and when the last day is come, there are no more daies left for us to die.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ustice,</hi> or of that justice which supposes exchange of things profitable for things profitable: that is, I supply your need, you may supply mine; as I doe a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to you, I may receive one by you: and because every man may be injured by another, therefore his security shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon mine: if he will not not let me be safe, he shall not be safe himself (only the manner of his being punished, is upon great reason both by God and all the World taken from particulars, and committed to a publick dis-interested person, who will doe justice without passion, both to him and to me.) If he refuses to doe me advantage, he shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive none when his needs require it. And thus <hi>God gave necessities</hi> to men, that all men might need; and <hi>several abilities</hi> to several persons that each m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n might help to supply the publick needs, and by joyning to fill up all wants, they may be knit together by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice as the parts of the world are by nature: and <hi>he hath made us all obnoxious</hi> to injuries, and made every little thing strong enough to doe us hurt by some instrument or other;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42503:107"/>
and hath given us all a sufficient stock of self-love, and desire of self preservation, to be as the chain to tie together all the parts of society, and to restrain us from doing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, lest we be violently dealt withall our selves.</p>
            <p>The other part of justice is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>distributive,</hi> and is commanded in this rule,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.7.</note> [<hi>Render to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, custome to whome cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour. Owe no man any thing, but to love one another</hi>] This justice is distinguished from the first, because the obligation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon contract or express bargain, but passes upon us by virtue of some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, or our Superiour, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or by grace, by piety or religion, by trust or by office,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 4.10.</note> according to that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment [<hi>As every man hath received the gift, so let him minister the same one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</hi> And as the first considers an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of persons in respect of the contract or particular necessity: this supposes a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of persons, and no particular bargains, but such necessary entercourses, as by the Laws of God or man are introduced. But I shall reduce all the particulars of both kindes to these four heads: 1. Obedience, 2. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision. 3. Negotiation. 4. Restitution.</p>

For since GOD governs all the World as a King, provides for us as a Father, and is the great Guide and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor of our spirits as the Head of the Church, and the great Shepherd and Bishop of our souls, they who have portions of these dignities, have also their share of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration: the summe of all which is usually signified in these two words [<hi>Governing</hi>] and <hi>Feeding</hi>] and is particularly recited in the following rules.</p>

                     </note>2. In the making Laws Princes must have regard to the publick dispositions, to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and disaffections of the people; and must not introduce a Law with publick scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and displeasure: but consider the publick benefit, and the present capacity of affairs and general inclinations of mens mindes. For he that enforces a Law upon a people against their first and publick apprehensions tempts them to disobedience, and makes Laws to become snares and hooks to catch the people, and to enrich the treasury with the spoil and tears and curses of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munalty, and to multiply their mutiny and their sin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Princes must provide that the Laws be duly executed: for a good Law without exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is like an unperformed promise: and therefore they must be severe exactors of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts from their Delegates and Ministers of Justice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The severity of Laws must be tempered with dispensations, pardons, and remissions according as the case shall alter, and new ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities be introduced, or some singular acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent shall happen,<note place="margin">

And thus the people with their importunity prevailed against <hi>Saul</hi> in the case of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and obtained his pardon for breaking the Law which his Father made, because his necessity forced him to taste ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and his breaking the Law in that case did promote that service whose promotion was intended by the Law.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Princes must be Fathers of the people,
<pb facs="tcp:42503:114"/>
and provide such instances of gentleness, ease, wealth, and advantages, as may make mutual confidence between them; and must fix their security under God in the love of the people, which therefore they must with all arts of sweetness, remission, popularity, nobleness and sincerity endeavour to secure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Princes must not multiply publick Oaths without great, eminent, and violent necessity, lest the security of the King become a snare to the people, and they become false when they see themselves suspected, or impatient when they are violently held fast: but the greater and more useful caution is upon things then upon persons; and if security of Kings can be obtained otherwise, it is better that Oaths should be the last refuge, and when nothing else can be sufficient.</p>

For although the poor must fare no worse for his poverty, yet in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice he must fare no better for it: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the rich must be no more regarded, yet he must not be lesse. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Tutor of <hi>Cyrus</hi> instructed him, when in a controversie where a great Boy would have taken a large Coat from a little Boy, because his own was too little for him, and the others was too big, he adjudged the great Coat to the great Boy: his Tutor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, Sir, If you were made a Judge of decency or witness, you had judged well in giving the biggest to the biggest: but when you were appointed Judge, not whom the Coat did fit, but whose it was, you should have considered the title, and the possession, who did the violence, and who made it, or who bought it. And so it must be in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments between the Rich and the Poor:

He that borrows is bound to pay, and much more he that steals or cheats.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42503:122"/>
Debtor is after the time in which he should and could have made payment. For in all sins we are to distinguish the transient or passing act from the remaining effect or evil. The act of stealing was soon over, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be undone, and for it the sinner is only answerable to God, or his Vicegerent, and he is in a par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But because in the case of stealing there is an injury done to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and the evil still remains after the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is past, therefore for this we are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our neighbour, and we are to take the evil off from him which we brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, or else he is an injured person, a sufferer all the while: and that any man should be the worse for me and my direct act, and by my intention, is against the rule of equity, of justice and of charity;<note place="margin">

And suppose that thou hast perswaded an injury to be done to thy Neighbour which others would have perswaded if thou hast not, yet thou art still obliged, because thou really didst cause the injury just as they had been obliged if they had done it; and thou art not at all the lesse bound by having persons as ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined as thou wert.</p>

He that hinders the charitable Legacy by fraud or violence, or the due Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy by intreaty, is equally obliged to resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. The reason of the latter part of this case is, because he that intreats or perswades to a sin is as guilty as he that acts it: and if without his perswasion the sin and the injury would not be acted, he is in his kinde the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire cause, and therefore obliged to repair the injury as much as the person that does the wrong immediately.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He that refuses to doe any part of his duty (to which he is otherwise obliged) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a bribe, is bound to restore that money, bcause he tooke it in his Neighbours wrong, and not as a salary for his labour, or a reward of his wisdome; for his stipend hath paid all that, or he hath obliged himselfe to doe it by his voluntary undertaking.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He that takes any thing from his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour which was justly forfeited, but yet takes it not as a Minister of justice, but to satisfie his own revenge or avarice, is tied to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42503:124"/>
but not to restitution. For my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is not the worse for my act, for thither the Law and his own demerits bore him, but because I took the forfeiture indirectly I am answerable to God, for my unhandsome, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, or uncharitable circumstances. Thus <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedon was reproved by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stides</hi> for destroying the <hi>Phocenses</hi>; because although they deserved it, yet he did it not in prosecution of the Law of Nations, but to enlarge his own dominions.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Heir of an obliged person is not bound to make restitution, if the obligation pass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> understanding cannot fathom nor search out their depth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To believe nothing concerning God but what is honourable and excellent, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that belief to be no honouring of God which entertains of him any dishonourable thoughts. Faith is the parent of Charity, and whatsoever Faith entertains must be apt to produce love to God: but he that believes God to be cruel or unmerciful, or a rejoicer in the unavoidable damnation of the greatest part of mankinde, or that he speaks one thing and privately means another; thinks evil thoughts concerning God, and such, as for which we should hate a man, and therefore are great enemies of Faith, being apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy Charity. Our Faith concerning God must be as himself hath revealed and descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed his own excellencies: and in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses we must remove from him all imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and attribute to him all excellence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To give our selves wholly up to Christ in heart and desire to become Disciples of his doctrine with choice (besides conviction) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the presence of God, but as Ideots, that is, without any principles of our own to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the truth of God; but sucking in greedily
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42503:133"/>
all that <hi>God</hi> hath taught us, believing it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, and loving to believe it. For this is an act of Love reflected upon Faith, or an act of Faith leaning upon Love.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To believe all <hi>Gods</hi> promises, and that whatsoever is promised in Scripture shall on <hi>Gods</hi> part be as surely performed as if we had it in possession. This act makes us to relie upon <hi>God</hi> with the same confidence as we did on our Parents when we were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when we made no doubt, but whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we needed we should have it if it were in their power.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To believe also the conditions of the promise, or that part of the revelation which concerns our duty. Many are apt to believe the Article of remission of sins, but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it without the condition of repentance, of the fruits of holy life: and that is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Article otherwise then <hi>God</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it. For the Covenant of the Gospel is the great object of Faith, and that supposes our duty to answer his grace; that <hi>God</hi> will be our <hi>God,</hi> so long as we are his people: The other is not Faith, but Flattery.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To professe publickly the doctrine of Jesus Christ, openly owning whatsoever he hath revealed and commanded, not being ashamed of the Word of <hi>God,</hi> or of any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices enjoyned by it; and this, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with any mans interest, not regarding favour, nor being moved with good words, not fearing disgrace, or losse, or inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or death it self.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To pray without doubting, without weariness, without faintness, entertaining no
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42503:133"/>
jealousies, or suspicions of <hi>God,</hi> but being confident of <hi>Gods</hi> hearing us, and of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to us, whatsoever the manner or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance be, that if we doe our duty, it will be gracious and merciful.</p>
                  <p>These acts of Faith are in several degrees in the servants of Jesus: some have it but as a grain of mustard-seed, some grow up to a plant, some have the fulness of faith: but the least faith that is must be a perswasion so strong as to make us undertake the doing of all that duty which Christ built upon the foundation of believing: but we shall best discern the truth of our faith by these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing signes.

I have sinned and GOD smote me not: his mercies are still over the penitent; I hope he will deliver me from all the evils I have deserved. He hath forgiven me many sins of malice, and therefore surely he will pity my infirmities. * 3.

and therefore I Hope if I doe my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour he will totally forgive me. * 5. He helped my slow and beginning endevours, and therefore I hope he will lead me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. * 6. When he had given me some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing first, then he gave me more. I hope therefore he will keep me from falling, and give me the grace of perseverance. * 7. He hath chosen me to be a Disciple of Christs institution; he hath elected me to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of grace, and therefore I hope also to the Kingdom of his glory. * 8.

               <p>LOve is the greatest thing that God can give us, for himself is love; and it is the greatest thing we can give to God, for it will also give our selves, and carry with it all that is ours. The Apostle calls it the band of perfection; it is <hi>the Old,</hi> and it is <hi>the New,</hi> and it is <hi>the great Commandement,</hi> and it is all the Commandements, for it <hi>is the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Law.</hi> It does the work of all other graces, without any instrument but its own immediate virtue. For is the love to sin makes a Man sin against all his own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and all the discourses of wisdom, and all the advices of his friends, and without temptation, and without opportunity: so does the love of God; it makes a man chaste
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42503:142"/>
without the laborious arts of fasting and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour disciplines, temperate in the midst of feasts, and is active enough to choose it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intermedial appetites, and reaches at Glory through the very heart of Grace, without any other arms but those of Love. It is a grace that loves God for himself, and our Neighbours for God. The consideration of Gods goodness and bounty, the experience of those profitable and excellent emanations from him, may be, and most commonly are the first motive of our love: but when we are once entred, and have tasted the goodness of God, we love the spring for its own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, passing from passion to reason from thanking to adoring, from sense to spirit, from considering our selves to an union with God and this is the image and little repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of Heaven; it is beatitude in pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or rather the infancy and beginnings of glory.</p>
               <p>We need no incentives by way of special enumeration to move us to the love of God, for we cannot love any thing for any reason reall or imaginary, but that excellence is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more eminent in God. There can but two things create love, <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi>: to which answer on our part, 1. <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,</hi> and 2. <hi>Desire</hi>: and both these are centred in love. <hi>For the entertainment of the first,</hi> there is in God an infinite nature, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity or vastness without extension or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, Immutability, Eternity, Omnipotence, Omniscience, Holiness, Dominion, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Bounty, Mercy, Justice, Perfection in himself, and the end to which all things and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42503:142"/>
all actions must be directed, and will at last arrive. The consideration of which may be heightned, if we consider our distance from all these glories. Our smallness and limited nature, our nothing, our inconstancy, our age like a span, our weakness and ignorance, our poverty, our inadvertency and inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our disabilities and disaffections to doe good our harsh natures and unmerciful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, our universal iniquity, and our necessities and dependencies, not only on God originally, and essentially, but even our need of the meanest of Gods creatures, and our being obnoxious to the weakest and the most contemptible. But <hi>for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the second</hi> we may consider that in him is a torrent of pleasure for the voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, he is the fountain of honour for the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, an inexhaustible treasure for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous: our vices are in love with phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick pleasures and images of perfection, which are truly and really to be found no where but in <hi>God.</hi> And therefore our vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues have such proper objects, that it is but reasonable they should all turn into love: for certain it is that this love will turn all into virtue.<note place="margin">

                  <head>The Measures and Rules of Divine Love.</head>
                  <p>But because this passion is pure as the brightest and smoothest mirrour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is apt to be sullyed with every impurer breath, we must be careful that our love to <hi>God</hi> be governed by these measures.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That our love be sweet, even, and full of tranquillity, having in it no violences or transportations, but going on in a course of holy actions and duties which are proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to our condition, and present state; not to satisfie al the desire, but all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities and measures of our strength. A new beginner in religion hath passionate and violent desires, but they must not be the measure of his actions: But he must consider his strength, his late sickness and state of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42503:144"/>
death, the proper temptations of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and stand at first upon his defence, not go to storm a strong Fort, or attaque a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent enimie, or doe heroical actions and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for gyants in Religion. Indiscreet violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and untimely forwardness are the rocks of religion, against which tender spirits often suffer shipwrack.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let our love be prudent and without il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion: that is, that it expresse it self in such instances which God hath chosen, or which we choose our selves by proportion to his rules and measures. Love turns into doting when religion turns into superstition. No degree of love can be imprudent, but the expressions may: we cannot love God too much, but we may proclaim it in undecent manners.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let our love be firm, constant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable, not coming and returning like the tide, but descending like a never failing river, ever running into the Ocean of Divine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, passing on in the chanels of duty and a constant obedience, and never ceasing to be what it is, till it comes to be what it desires to be; still being a river till it be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into sea and vastness, even the immensity of a blessed Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Although the consideration of the Divine excellencies and mercies be infinitely suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to produce in us love to God (who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible and yet not distant from us, but we feel him in his blessings, he dwells in our hearts by faith, wee feed on him in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and are made all one with him in the incarnation and glorifications of Jesus)

yet that we may the better enkindle and encrease our love to God, the following ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices are not uselesse.</p>

                  <head>Helps to increase our love to God; by way of exercise.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Cut off all earthly and sensual loves, for they pollute and unhallow the pure and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual love. Every degree of inordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the things of this world, and every act of love to a sin is a perfect enemy to the love of God: and it is a great shame to take any part of our affection from the eternal God to bestow it upon his creature in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Creator, or to give it to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, our open enemy, in disparagement of him who is the fountain of all excellencies and Celestial amities.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Lay fetters and restraints upon the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative and phantastick part: because our fancie being an imperfect and higher faculty is usually pleased with the entertainment of shadows and gauds; and because the things of the world fill it with such beauties and phantastick imagery, the fancy presents such objects as amiable to the affections, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive powers. Persons of fancy, such as are women and children, have alwaies the most violent loves; but therefore if we be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full with what representments we fill our fancy, we may the sooner rectifie our loves. To this purpose, it is good that we transplant the instruments of fancy into religion: and for this reason musick was brought into Churches, and ornaments, and perfumes, and comely garments, and solemnities, and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42503:145"/>
decent ceremonies, that the busie and lesse discerning fancy being bribed with its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per objects may be instrumentall to a more celestial and spiritual love.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Remove solicitude or wordly cares, and multitudes of secular businesses; for if these take up the intention and actual appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our thoughts and our imployments, they will also possesse our passions; which if they be filled with one object though ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble, cannot attend another though more excellent. We alwaies contract a friendship and relation with those with whom we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse: our very Countrey is dear to us for our being in it: and the Neighbours of the same Village, and those that buy and sell with us have seised upon some portions of our love, and therefore if we dwel in the affairs of the World, we shall also grow in love with them; and all our love, or all our hatred, all our hopes, or all our fears, which the eternal God would willingly secure to himself, and esteem amongst his treasures and precious things, shall be spent upon trifles and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Doe not only choose the things of God, but secure your inclinations and aptnesses for God and for Religion. For it will be a hard thing for a Man to doe such a personal violence to his first desires, as to choose what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he hath no minde to. A Man will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times satisfie the importunity and daily solicitations of his first longings: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is nothing can secure our loves to God, but stopping the natural Fountains, and making Religion to grow neer the first desires of the soul.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:42503:146"/>5. Converse with God by frequent prayer. In particular desire that your desires may be right, and love to have your affections regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and holy: To which purpose make very frequent addresses to God by ejaculations and communions, and an assiduous daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion: Discover to him all your wants, complain to him of all your affronts, doe as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, lay your misfortunes and your ill news before him, <hi>spread them before the Lord,</hi> call to him for health, run to him for counsel, beg of him for pardon: and it is as natural to love him to whom we make such addresses, and of whom we have such dependencies, as it is for children to love their parents.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Consider the immensity and vastness of the Divine love to us, expressed in all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manations of his providence. 1. <hi>In his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 2. <hi>In his conservation of us.</hi> For it is not my Prince, or my Patron, or my Friend that supports me, or relieves my needs, but God, who made the Corn that my friend sends me, who created the Grapes, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him, who hath as many dependences, and as many natural necessities, and as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect disabilities as my self. God indeed made him the instrument of his providence to me, as he hath made his own Land or his own Cattel to him: with this only difference, that God by his ministration to me intends to doe him a favour and a reward, which to natural instruments he does not. 3. <hi>In giving his Son.</hi> 4. <hi>In forgiving our sins.</hi> 5. <hi>In adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to glory</hi>: and ten thousand times ten thousand little accidents and instances hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

                  <head>The two states of love to God.</head>
                  <p>The least love that is must be <hi>obedient, pure, simple, and communicative</hi>: that is, it must exclude all affection to sin, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate affection to the World; and must be expressive according to our power, in the instances of duty, and must be love for loves sake; and of this love Martyrdome is the highest instance; that is, a readiness of minde rather to <hi>suffer</hi> any evil then <hi>to doe</hi> any. Of this our blessed Saviour affirmed, <hi>That no man had greater love then this</hi>: that is, this is the highest point of duty, the greatest love that God requires of Man. And yet he that is the most imperfect must have this love also in preparation of minde, and must differ
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42503:147"/>
from another in nothing, except in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of promptness and alacrity. And in this sense, he that loves God truly (though but with a beginning and tender love) yet he loves God with all his heart, that is, with that degree of love which is the highest point of duty, and of Gods charge upon us; and he that loves God with all his heart, may yet increase <hi>with the increase of God,</hi> just as there are degrees of love to God among the Saints, and yet each of them love him with all their powers and capacities.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the greater state of love is the <hi>zeal of love,</hi> which runs out into excrescencies, and suckers like a fruitfull and pleasant tree, or bursting into gums, and producing fruits, not of a monstrous, but of an extraordinary and heroicall greatness. Concerning which, these cautions are to be observed.</p>

                        </gap>. Gal. 4.18.</note>1. If zeal be in the beginnings of our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual birth, or be short, sudden and transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or be a consequent of a mans natural temper, or come upon any cause, but after a long growth of a temperate and well regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated love, it is to be suspected for passion, and forwardness, rather then the verticall point of love.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That zeal only is good which in a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent love hath temperate expressions. For let the affection boyl as high as it can, yet if it boyl over into irregular and strange actions, it will <hi>have but few,</hi> but <hi>will need many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses. Elijah</hi> was zealous for the Lord of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42503:147"/>
Hosts, and yet he was so transported with it, that he could not receive answer from God, till by musick he was recomposed and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: and <hi>Moses</hi> broke both the Tables of the Law by being passionately zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them that brake the first.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Zeal must spend its greatest heat princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in those things that concern our selves; but with great care and restraint in those that concern others.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Remember that zeal being an excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence of Divine love, must in no sense contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict any action of love: Love to God includes love to our Neighbour, and therefore no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of zeal for Gods glory must make us uncharitable to our brother,<note place="margin">Phil. 3 6</note> for that is just so pleasing to God, as hatred is an act of love.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That Zeal that concerns others, can spend it self in nothing but arts, and actions and charitable instruments for their good: and when it concerns the good of many that one should suffer, it must be done by persons of a competent authority, and in great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, in seldom instances, according to the Law of God or Man; but never by private right, or for trifling accidents, of in mistaken propositions. The Zealots in the Old Law had authority to transfix and stab some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain persons; but God gave them warrant; it was in the case of Idolatry, or such notorious huge crimes; the danger of which was insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, and the cognizance of which was infallible: and yet that warrant expired with the Synagogue.</p>

                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:42503:148"/>6. Zeal in the instances of our own duty, and personal deportment is more safe then in matters of counsel, and actions besides our just duty, and tending towards perfection, Though in these instances there is not a direct sin, even where the zeal is lesse wary, yet there is much trouble and some danger: (as, if it be spent in the too forward vows of Chastity, and restraints of natural and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent liberties.)</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Zeal may be let loose in the instances of internal, personal, and spiritual actions, that are matters of direct duty: as in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and acts of adoration, and thanksgiving, and frequent addresses: provided that no indirect act passe upon them to defile them; such as complacency, and opinions of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, censuring others, scruples and opinions of necessity, unnecessary fears, superstitious numbrings of times and hours; but let the zeal be as forward as it will, as devout as it will, as Seraphicall as it will, in the direct ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse and entercourse with God, there is no danger,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>SECT. IV.</hi> Of Reading, or Hearing the Word of God.</head>
               <p>REading and Hearing the Word of God are but the several circumstances of the same duty; instrumental especially to faith, but consequently to all other graces of the Spirit. It is all one to us whether by the eye or by the ear the Spirit conveys his precepts to us. If we hear Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saying to us, that [<hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge:</hi>] or read it in one of his Epistles; in either of them we are equally and sufficiently instructed. The Scriptures read are the same thing to us, which the same doctrine was, when it was preached by the Disciples of our blessed Lord; and we are to learn of either with the same dispositions. There are many that cannot read the Word, and they must
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42503:149"/>
take it in by the ear; and they that can read, finde the same Word of God by the eye. It is necessary that all men learn it in some way or other, and it is sufficient in order to their practise that they learn it any way. <hi>The Word of God</hi> is all those Commandments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, those promises and threatnings, the stories and sermons recorded in the Bible: nothing else is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> that we know of, by any certain instrument. The good books and spiritual discourses, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons or homilies written or spoken by men are but <hi>the Word of men,</hi> or rather explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of, and exhortations according to the <hi>Word of God</hi>: but of themselves they are not the <hi>Word of God.</hi> In a sermon, the Text only is in a proper sense to be called <hi>Gods Word</hi>: and yet good Sermons are of great use and convenience for the advantages of Religion. He that preaches an hour together against drunkenness with the tongue of men or Angels, hath spoke no other word of God but this [<hi>Be not drunk with wine wherein there is excesse</hi>:] and he that writes that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in a book, and publishes that book, hath preached to all that read it, a louder Sermon then could be spoken in a Church. This I say to this purpose, that we may sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate truth from error, popular opinions from substantial Truths. For God preaches to us in the Scripture, and by his secret assistances and spiritual thoughts and holy motions: Good men preach to us when they by popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar arguments, and humane arts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyances expound and presse any of those doctrines which God hath preached unto us in his holy Word. But</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:42503:150"/>1. The Holy Ghost is certainly the best Preacher in the world, and the worst of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture the best Sermons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the doctrine of salvation is plainly set down there, that the most unlearned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by hearing it read, may understand all his duty. What can be plainer spoken then this [<hi>Thou shalt not kill. Be not drunk with wine. Husbands love your Wives. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye would that men should doe to you, doe ye so to them?</hi>] The wit of man cannot more plainly tell us our duty, or more fully, then the Holy Ghost hath done already.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Good Sermons, and good books are of excellent use: but yet they can serve no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end but that we practise the plaine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What <hi>Abraham</hi> in the parable said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the brethren of the rich man, is here very proper: <hi>They have Moses and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 16 29, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>let them hear them: But if they refuse to hear these, neither will they believe though one should arise from the dead</hi> to preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Reading the holy Scriptures is a duty expresly <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 31.13. Luke 24 45. Mat 22.29. Acts 15.21. Rev 1.3. 2 Tim. 3.16.</note> commanded us, and is called in Scripture [<hi>Preaching:</hi>] all other preaching is the effect of humane skill and industry, and although of great benefit, yet it is but an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical ordinance; the Law of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Preaching, being expressed in the matter of reading the Scriptures, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Word of God, <hi>which is,</hi> and <hi>as it is</hi> there described.</p>
               <p>But this duty is reduced to practise in the following Rules.</p>

                  <head>Rules for Hearing or Reading the Word of God.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Set apart some portion of thy time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opportunities of thy calling and necessary imployment, for the reading of holy Scripture; and if it be possible, every day read or hear some of it read: you are sure that book teaches all truth, commands all holiness, and promises all happiness.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When it is in your power to choose, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome your self to such portions which are most plaine and certain duty, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the story of the Life and Death of our blessed Saviour. Read the Gospels, the Psalms of <hi>David</hi>; and especially those portions of Scripture which by the wisdome of the Church are appointed to be publickly read upon Sundaies and holy-daies, <hi>viz</hi>: the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles and Gospels, in the choice of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther portions, you may advise with a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Guide, that you may spend your time with most profit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Fail not diligently to attend to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the holy Scriptures upon those daies wherein it is most publickly and solemnly read in Churches: for at such times, besides the learning our duty, we obtaine a blessing along with it, it becoming to us upon those daies a part of solemn Divine worship.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When the Word of God is read or preached to you, be sure you be of a ready heart and minde, free from worldly cares and thoughts, diligent to hear, carefull to mark, studious to remember, and desirous to practise all that is commanded, and to live
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:42503:151"/>
according to it: Doe not hear for any other end but to become better in your life, and to be instructed in every good work, and to increase in the love and service of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Beg of God by prayer that he would give you the spirit of obedience and profit, and that he would by his Spirit write the Word in your heart, and that you describe it in your life. To which purpose serve your self of some affectionate ejaculations to that purpose, before and after this duty.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. Let not a prejudice to any mans person hinder thee from receiving good by his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, if it be according to godliness: but (if occasion offer it, or espcially if duty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it to thee; that is, if it be preached in that assembly where thou art bound to be present) accept the word preached as a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage from God, and the Minister as his Angel in that ministration.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Consider and remark the doctrine that is represented to thee in any discourse; and if the Preacher adds any accidental advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, any thing to comply with thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or to put thy spirit into action, or holy resolution, remember it, and make use of it; but if the Preacher be a weak person, yet the Text is the doctrine thou art to remember; that containes all thy duty, it is worth thy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to hear that spoken often, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed upon thy thoughts, and though thou beest a learned man, yet the same thing which thou knowest already, if spoken by
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:42503:151"/>
another may be made active by that appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. I can better be comforted by my own considerations, if another hand applies them, then if I doe it my self; because the word of God does not work as a natural agent, but as a Divine instrument: it does not prevail by the force of deduction, and artificial dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursings only, but chiefly by way of blessing in the ordinance, and in the ministery of an appointed person. At least obey the publick order, and reverence the constitution, and give good example of humility, charity and obedience.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. When scriptures are read, you are only to enquire with diligence and modesty into the meaning of the Spirit: but if Homilies or Sermons be made upon the words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, you are to consider, whether all that be spoken be conformable to the Scriptures. For although you may practise for humane reasons, and humane arguments ministred from the Preachers art, yet you must practise nothing but the command of God, nothing but the Doctrine of Scripture, that is, the Text.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Use the advice of some spiritual or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prudent man for the choice of such spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual books which may be of use and benefit for the edification of thy spirit in the waies of holy living; and esteem that time well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, that is prudently and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately imployed, in hearing or reading good books and pious discourses: ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that God by hearing us speak to him in prayer, obliges us to hear him speak to us in his word, by what instrument soever it be conveyed.</p>

               <p>FAsting, if it be considered in it self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relation to spiritual ends, is a duty no where enjoyned, or counselled. But Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity hath to doe with it, as it may be made an instrument of the Spirit by subduing the lusts of the flesh, or removing any hindrances of religion; And it hath been practised by all ages of the Church, and advised in order to three ministeries: 1. To Prayer; 2. To Mortification of bodily lusts; 3. To Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: and is to be practised according to the following measures.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Rules for Christian Fasting.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Fasting in order to prayer is to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by the proportions of the times of prayer: that is, it ought to be a totall fast from all things during the solemnity (unlesse a probable necessity intervene.) Thus the Jews eat nothing upon the Sabbath-daies till their great offices were performed, that is, about the sixth hour: and S. <hi>Peter</hi> used it as an argument that the Apostles in Pentecost were not drunk, because it was but the third hour of the day, of such a day, in which it was not lawful to eat or drink till the sixth hour: and the Jews were offended at the Disciples for plucking the ears of corn upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath early in the morning, because it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time in which by their customs they esteemed it lawfull to break their fast. In imitation of this custom, and in prosecution of the reason of it, the Christian Church hath
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42503:152"/>
religiously observed fasting before the holy Communion: and the more devout persons (though without any obligation at all) refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to eat or drink till they had finished their morning devotions: and further yet upon daies of publick humiliation, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to be spent wholly in Devotion, and for the averting Gods judgments (if they were imminent) fasting is commanded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with prayer, commanded (I say) by the Church to this end, that the Spirit might be clearer and more Angelical when it is quitted in some proportions from the loads of flesh.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Fasting, when it is <hi>in order to Prayer,</hi> must be a total abstinence from all meat, or else an abatement of the quantity: for the help which fasting does to prayer cannot be served by changing flesh into flesh, or milk-meats into dry diet, but by turning much into little, or little into none at all during the time of solemn and extraordinary prayer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Fasting <hi>as it is instrumental to Prayer,</hi> must be attended with other aids of the like virtue and efficacy, such as are removing for the time all worldly care and secular busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; and therefore our blessed Saviour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds these parts within the same caution: [<hi>Take heed lest your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares of this world, and that day overtake you una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.</hi>] To which add <hi>alms</hi>;<note place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4. When <hi>Fasting is intended to serve the duty of Repentance,</hi> it is then best chosen
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42503:153"/>
when it is short, sharp and afflictive; that is, <hi>either a total abstinence</hi> from all nourishment (according as we shall appoint, or be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed) during such a time as is separate for the solemnity and attendance upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: or if we shall extend our feverity beyond the solemn daies, and keep our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against our sin as we are to keep our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that is, alwaies in a readiness, and often to be called upon; <hi>then, to refuse a pleasant morsel,</hi> to abstain from the bread of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and only to take wholsome and lesse pleasing nourishment, vexing our appetite by the refusing a lawful satisfaction, since in its petulancy and luxury it preyed upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Fasting designed for repentance</hi> must be ever joyned with an extreme care that we fast from sin: for there is no greater folly or undecency in the world, then to commit that for which I am now judging and condemning my self. This is the best fast, and the other may serve to promote the interest of this, by increasing the disaffection to it, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying arguments against it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>He that fasts for repentance,</hi> must, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that solemnity, abstain from all bodily delights, and the sensuality of all his senses, and his appetites; for a man must not when he mourns in his fast, be merry in his sport; weep at dinner, and laugh all day after; haue a silence in his kitchin, and musick in his chamber; judge the stomack, and feast the other senses. I deny not but a man may in a single instance punish a particular sin with a proper instrument: If a man have offended
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:42503:153"/>
in his palate, he may choose to fast only; if he have sinned in so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tness and in his touch, he may choose to lie hard, or work hard, and use sharp inflictions: but although this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline be proper and particular, yet because the sorrow is of the whole man, no sense must rejoice, or be with any study or purpose fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and entertained softly. This rule is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to relate to the solemn daies appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for repentance publickly or privately: besides which in the whole course of our life, even in the midst of our most festival and freer joyes we may sprincle some single in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and acts of self-condemning, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing: as to refuse a pleasant morsel, or a delicious draught with a tacit remembrance of the sin that now returns to displease my spirit: and though these actions be single, there is no undecency in them, because a man may abate of his ordinary liberty and bold freedom with great prudence, so he does it without singularity in himself, or trouble to others: but he may not abate of his solemn sorrow: <hi>that</hi> may be <hi>caution</hi>; but <hi>this</hi> would be softness, effeminacy, and undecency.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When <hi>fasting is an act of mortification,</hi> that is, is intended to subdue a bodily lust; as the spirit of fornication, or the fondness of strong and impatient appetites, it must not be a sudden, sharp, and violent fast, but <hi>a state of fasting,</hi> a dyet of fasting, a daily lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our portion of meat and drink, and a choosing such a course dyet which may make the least preparation for the lusts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. He that fasts three daies without food,<note place="margin">

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:42503:154"/>
of fornication: and when the meals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn as usually, they also will be served as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon as any. In the mean time they will be supplied and made active by the accidental heat that comes with such violent fastings: for this is a kind of aerial Devil; the Prince that rules in the air is the Devil of fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and he will be as tempting with the windiness of a violent fast, as with the flesh of an ordinary meal. But a daily substraction of the nourishment will introduce a lesse bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie habit of body, and that will prove the more effectual remedy.</p>

Sect. 2, &amp; 3.</note>8. fasting alone will not cure this Devil, though it helps much towards it; but it must not therefore be neglected, but assisted by all the proper instruments of remedy against this unclean spirit; and what it is unable to doe alone, in company with other instruments, and Gods blessing upon them it may effect.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. All fasting for whatsoever end it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, must be done without any opinion of the necessity of the thing it self, without censuring others, with all humility, in order to the proper end; and just as a man takes physick, of which no man hath reason to be proud, and no man thinks it necessary, but because he is in sickness, or in danger and disposition to it.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. All fasts ordained by lawful authority are to be observed in order to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses to which they are enjoyned; and to be accompanied with actions of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, just as it is in private fasts; for there is no other difference, but that in publick our Superiours choose for us, what in private we doe for our selves.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:42503:154"/>11. Fasts ordained by lawful authority are not to be neglected because alone they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe the thing in order to which they were enjoyned. It may be one day of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation will not obtain the blessing, or alone kill the lust, yet it must not be despised if it can doe any thing towards it. An act of Fasting is an act of self-denial, and though it doe not produce the habi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, yet it is a good act.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. When a principal end why a Fast is publickly prescribed, is obtained by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther instrument in a particular person; as if the spirit of Fornication be cured by the rite of Marriage, or by a gift of chastity, yet that person so eased is not freed from the Fasts of the Church by that alone, if those fasts can prudently serve any other end of Religion, as that of prayer, or repentance, or mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some other appetite: for when it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental to any and of the Spirit, it is freed from superstition, and then we must have some other reason to quit us from the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or that alone will not doe it.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. When the Fast publickly commanded by reason of some indisposition in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular person cannot operate to the end of the Commandment, yet the avoiding offence, and the complying with publick order is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son enough to make the obedience to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. For he that is otherwise disobliged (as when the reason of the Law ceases, as to his particular, yet) remains still obliged if he cannot doe otherwise without scandal: but this is an obligation of charity, not of justice.</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:42503:155"/>14. All fasting is to be used with prudence and charity: for there is no end to which fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing serves, but may be obtained by other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, and therefore it must at no hand be made an instrument of scruple, or become an enemy to our health, or be imposed upon persons that are sick or aged, or to whom it is in any sense uncharitable; such as are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Travellers; or to whom in the wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>TRue naturall Religion, that which was common to all Nations and Ages did principally relye upon four great propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: 1. That there is one God. 2.

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42503:156"/>
Great Creator of all things without himself: and according to these were fram'd the four first precepts of the Decalogue. In the first, the Unitie of the Godhead is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed. In the second, his invisibility and immate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

In the third is affirmed God's government and providence, by aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them that swear falsly by his Name, by which also his Omniscience is declared. In the fourth Commandement, he proclaims himself the Maker of Heaven and Earth: for in memorie of God's rest from the work of six daies, the seventh was hallowed into a Sabbath: and the keeping it was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing GOD to bee the great Maker of Heaven and Earth; and consequently to this, it al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So long as the Law of the Sabbath was bound upon God's people, so long GOD would have that to be the solemn manner of confessing these attributes; but when <hi>the Priesthood being changed there was a change also of the Law,</hi> the great dutie remain'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable in changed circumstances. We are eternally bound to confess God Almightie to bee the Maker of Heaven and Earth; but the manner of confessing it is chang'd from a rest or a doing nothing, to a speaking somthing, from a day to a symbol, from a ceremonie to a substance, from a Jewish rite to a Christian dutie: wee profess it in our Creed, wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it in our lives, wee describe it by every line of our life, by every action of dutie, by
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42503:156"/>
faith, and trust, and obedience: and wee do also upon great reason complie with the Jewish manner of c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nfessing the Creation, so far as it is instrumental to a real dutie. Wee keep one day in seven, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the manner and circumstance of the Creation: and wee rest also that wee may tend holie duties; so imitating God's rest bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Jew in <hi>Synesius,</hi> who lay upon his face from evening to evening, and could not by stripes or wounds bee raised up to steer the ship in a great storm: God's rest was not a natural cessation: hee who could not labor could not bee said to rest; but God's rest is to bee understood to bee a beholding and a rejoicing in his work finished: and therefore wee truly represent God's rest, when wee confess and rejoice in God's Works and God's glorie.</p>
               <p>This the Christian Church does upon every day, but especially upon the Lord's day which she hath set apart for this and all other Offices of Religion, being determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to this day, by the Resurrection of her dearest Lord, it beeing the first day of joy the Church ever had. And now upon the Lord's day wee are not tied to the rest of the Sabbath, but to all the work of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: &amp; wee are to abstain from bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, not because it is a direct dutie to us as it was to the Jews, but because it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in order to our dutie, that wee attend to the Offices of Religion.</p>

And therefore this is to be enlarged in the Gospel, whose Sabbath or rest is but a circumstance, and accessory to the principal and spiritual duties: Upon the Christian Sabbath, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity is to be served first, then charity, &amp; then religion; for this is to give place to charity <hi>in great instances</hi>; and the second to the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. Wee must bee careful that wee never ask any thing of God that is sinful, or that directly ministers to sin: for that is to ask of God to dishonour himself, and to undoe us: we had need consider what we pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it returns in blessing it must be join'd with Christs intercession, and presented to God: Let us principally ask of God power and assistances to doe our duty, to glorifie God, to do good works, to live a good life, to die in the fear and favour of God, and eternal life: these things God delights to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. Wee may lawfully pray to God for the gifts of the Spirit that minister to holy ends, such as are the gift of preaching, the spirit of praier, good expression, a ready and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loosed tongue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> good understanding, learning, opportunities to publish them, &amp;c. with these onely restraints. 1. That wee cannot be so confident of the event of those praiers, as of the former. 2. That we must be curious to secure our intention in these desires, that we may not ask them to serve our own ends, but onely for Gods glorie, and then we shall have them, or a blessing for desiring them. In order to such purposes our intentions in the first desires cannot bee amiss; because
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:42503:161"/>
they are able to sanctifie other things, and therefore cannot be unhallowed themselves. 3. Wee must submit to Gods Will, desiring him to choose our imployment, and to furnish our persons as hee shall see ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whatsoever we may lawfully desire of temporal things, wee may lawfully ask of God in praier, and we may expect them as they are promised. 1. Whatsoever is necessary to our life and beeing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to us; and therefore wee may with certainty expect food and raiment; food to keep us alive; clothing to keep us from nakedness and shame; so long as our life is permitted to us, so long all things necessary to our life shall be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred: wee may be secure of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but not secure of life, for that is promised, not this: onely concerning food and raiment we are not to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts by the measure of our desires, but by the measure of our needs. 2. Whatsoever is convenient for us, pleasant, and modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delectable, we may pray for; so we do it. 1. with submission to Gods will. 2. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impatient desires. 3. That it be not a trifle and inconsiderable, but a matter so grave and concerning, as to bee a fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bee treated on between God and our souls. 4. That we ask it not to spend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our lusts, but for ends of justice, or charitie, or religion, and that they be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied with sobriety.</p>

But this admitts of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees according to the perfection or imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our state of life: but it hath no other measures, but ought to bee as great as it can, the bigger the better; wee must make no positive restraints upon it our selvs. In other things we are to use a bridle: and as wee must limit our desires with submission to Gods will: so also we must limit the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of our praiers by the moderation and
<pb facs="tcp:42503:163"/>
term of our desires. Pray for it as earnestly as you may desire it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Our desires must be lasting, and our praiers frequent, assiduous and continual: not asking for a blessing once and then leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; but daily renewing our snits, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising our hope, and faith, and patience, and long-suffering, and Religion, and resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and self-denial in all the degrees we shall be put to. This circumstance of duty our blessed Saviour taught, saying, [<hi>That men ought alwaies to pray and not to faint] Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to pray</hi> signifies the frequent doing of the duty in general:<note place="margin">Luke 18 1.22.1, 36.</note> but because we cannot alwaies ask several things, and we also have frequent need of the same things, and those are such as concern our great interest, the precept comes home to this very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, [<hi>praying without ceasing</hi>] and himself in his own case gave a precedent:<note place="margin">1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:42503:163"/>
he loves to hear us beg it, &amp; hath a design to give us more then we ask, even a satisfaction of our desires, and a blessing for the very importunity.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Let the words of our prayers be pertinent, grave, material, not studiously many, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our need, sufficient to express our wants, and to signifie our importunity. God hears us not the sooner for our many words, but much the sooner for an earnest desire, to which let apt and sufficient words minister, be they few, or many, according as it happens. A long praier and a short, differ not in their capacities of being accepted; for both of them take their value according to the fervency of spirit, and the charity of the praier. That prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which is short by reason of an impatient spirit, or dulness, or despite of holy things, or in differency of desires, is very often criminal, alwaies imperfect; and that praier which is long out of ostentation, or superstition, or a trifling spirit, is as criminal and imperfect as the other in their several instances. This rule relates to private praier. In publick, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is to be measured by the appointed office, and we are to support our spirit with spiritual arts, that our private spirit may be a part of the publick spirit, and be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the society and blessings of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. In all forms of praier mingle peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with thanksgiving, that you may endear the present praier, and the future blessing by returning praise and thanks for what we have already received. This is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> advice, [<hi>Bee careful for nothing,
<pb facs="tcp:42503:164"/>
but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests bee made known unto God.</hi>]</p>

And therefore our blessed Saviour in his Sermons joins watchfulness with praier: for Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are but assistances, not new creations of the whole habit in every instant, or period of our life. Read Scriptures, and then pray to GOD for understanding: pray against temptation, but you must also <hi>resist the Devil,</hi> and then <hi>he will flee from you.</hi> Ask of GOD competency of living, but you must also <hi>work with your hands, the things that are honest, that ye may have to supplie in time of need</hi>: We can but do our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and pray for blessing, and then leave the success with GOD: and beyond this we cannot deliberate, wee cannot take care; but so far we must.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose let every man studie his praiers, and read his dutie in his petitions. For the bodie of our praier is the summe of our dutie; and as wee ask of God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we need; so we must labour for all that we ask. Because it is our dutie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee must pray for Gods grace: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Gods grace is necessarie, and without it we can do nothing, we are sufficiently taught, that in the proper matter of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious

We who must love our Neighbours as our selves, must also pray for them as for our selves: with this onely difference; that we may enlarge in our temporal desires for Kings, and pray for secular prosperity to them with more importunity then for our selves; because they need more to enable their duty and government, and for the interests of Religion and Justice. This part of praier is by the Apostle called [<hi>Intercession</hi>] in which with special care we are to remember our Relatives, our Family, our Charge, our Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours, our creditours; not forgetting to beg pardon and charity for our Enemies, and protection against them.</p>

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath pleased <hi>God</hi> in all Ages of the World to admit of entercourse with his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the matter of vows, it is not ill advice, that we make vows to <hi>God</hi> in such cases in which we have great need, or great danger. But let it be done according to these rules and by these cautions.</p>
                  <p>1. That the matter of the Vow be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. 2. That it be useful in order to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or Charity. 3. That it be grave, not trifling and impertinent, but great in our proportion of duty towards the blessing. 4. That it be in an uncommanded instance, that is, that it be <hi>of something,</hi> or <hi>in some manner,</hi> or <hi>in some degree</hi> to which formerly wee were not formerly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or which we might have omitted without sinne. 5. That it be done with prudence, that is, that it be safe in all the circumstances of person, lest we beg a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and fall into a snare. 6. That every vow of a new action bee also accompanied
<pb facs="tcp:42503:166"/>
with a new degree and enforcement of our essential and unalterable duty: such as was <hi>Jacobs</hi> vow; that (besides the paiment of a tithe) <hi>God should be his God</hi>: that so hee might strengthen his duty to him first in es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials and precepts; and then in additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and accidentals.

He vows foolishly that promises to God to live and die in such an opinion, in an article not necessary, nor certain; or that upon confidence of his present guide, bindes himself for ever to the profession of what he may afterwards more reasonably contradict, or may finde not to bee useful, or not profitable, but of some danger, or of no necessitie.</p>

                  <p>If we feel our spirits apt to wander in our praiers, and to retire into the World, or to things unprofitable, or vain and impertinent;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Use praier to bee assisted in praier: pray for the spirit of supplication, for a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, fixed, and recollected spirit: and when to this you adde a moral industry to be stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in your thoughts, whatsoever wandrings after this do return irremediably, are a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie of Nature and an imperfection, but no sin while it is not ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rished and indulged to.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In private it is not amiss to attempt the cure by reducing your praiers into Collects and short forms of praier, making volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry interruptions, and beginning again, that the want of spirit and breath may bee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the short stages and periods.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When you have observed any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wandring of your thoughts, binde your self to repeat that praier again with actual attention, or else revolve the full sense of it in your spirit, and repeat it in all the effect and desires of it: and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly the tempter may bee driven away with
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42503:167"/>
his own art, and may cease to interpose his trifles, when he perceives they doe but vex the person into carefulness, and piety: and yet he loses nothing of his devotion, but doubles the earnestness of his care.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If this be not seasonable or opportune, or apt to any Mans circumstances, yet be sure with actual attention to say a hearty A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the whole prayer, with one united desire, earnestly begging the graces mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the prayer: for that desire does the great work of the prayer, and secures the blessing, if the wandring thoughts were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our will, and disclaimed by contending against them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Avoid multiplicity of businesses of the World; and in those that are unavoydable, labour for an evennesse and tranquillity of spirit, that you may be untroubled &amp; smooth in all tempests of fortune: for so we shall better tend Religion, when we are not torn in pieces with the cares of the World, and seased upon with low affections, passions and interest.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It helps much to attention and actual advertisement in our prayers, if w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The second temptation in our prayer is a tediousness of spirit, or a weariness of the imployment: like that of the Jews, who complained that they were weary of the new moons, and their souls loathed the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent return of their Sabbaths: so doe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many Christians, who first pray without servour and earnestness of spirit: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly meditate but seldom, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruit, or sense, or affection: or thirdly who seldom examine their consciences, and when they doe it, they doe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> but sleepily, slightly, without compunction, or hearty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, or fruits of amendment. 4. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large themselves in the thoughts and fruition of temporal things, running for comfort to them only in any sadness and misfortune. 5. They love not to frequent the Sacraments, nor any the instruments of religion, as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, confessions, prayers in publick fastings, but love ease, and a loose undiscipli'nd life. 6. They obey not their superiours, but follow their own judgment, when their judgment follows their affections, and their affections follow sense and worldly pleasures. 7. They neglect or dissemble, or deferre, or doe not attend to the motions and inclinations to virtue which the Spirit of God puts into their soul. 8. They repent them of their vows and holy purposes, not because they discover any
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:42503:168"/>
indiscretion in them, or intolerable incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, but because they have within them labor, (as the case now stands to them) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure. 9. They content themselves, with the first degrees and necessary parts of virtue, and when they are arrived thither, they sit down, as if they were come to the mountain of the Lord, and ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They enquire into all cases in which it may be lawful to omit a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and though they will not do less then they are bound to, yet they will do no more then needs must; for they do out of fear, and self-love, not out of the love of God, or the spirit of holyness and zeal. The event of which will be this. He that will do no more then needs must, will soon be brought to omit something of his duty, and will be apt to believe less to be necessary then is.</p>

                  <head>Remedies against tediousness of spirit.</head>
                  <p>The Remedies against this temptation are these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Order your privat devotions so, that they become not arguments &amp; causes of tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by their indiscreet length; but reduce your words into a narrower compass, still keeping all the matter, and what is cut off in the length of your praiers, supply in the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness of your spirit; for so nothing is lost while the words are changed into matter, and length of time into servencie of devotion. The forms are made not the less perfect, and the spirit is more, and the scruple is remov'd.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not imprudent if we provide va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of forms of Praier to the same purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:42503:168"/>
that the change by consulting with the appetites of fancy, may better entertain the Spirit: and possibly we may be pleased to recite a hymn, when a collect seems flat to us and unpleasant, and we are willing to sing rather then to say, or to sing this rather then that: we are certain that variety is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, and whether that be natural to us, or an imperfection, yet if it be complied with, it may remove some part of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Break your office and devotion into fragments, and make frequent returnings by ejaculations and abrupt entercourses with God; for so, no length can oppress your ten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derness and sickliness of spirit; and by often praying in such manner and in all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, we shall habituate our souls to prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by making it the business of many lesser portions of our time: and by thrusting in between all our other imploiments, it will make every thing relish of religion, and by degrees tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n all into its nature.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Learn to abstract your thoughts and desires from pleasures and things of the world. For nothing is a direct cure to this evil, but cutting off all others loves and adherences. Order your affairs so, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may be propounded to you as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and praier as your defence, and holy actions as your security, and charity and good works as your treasure: consider that all things else are satisfactions but to the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish part of a man, and that these are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshments and relishes of that noble part of us by which we are better then beasts: and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42503:169"/>
whatsoever other instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, exercise or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration is of use to take our loves from the world, the same is apt to place them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Doe not seek for deliciousness and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible consolations in the actions of religion, but only regard the duty and the conscience of it. For although in the beginning of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion most frequently, and at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>me other tim's irregularly, God complies with our infirmity, and encourages our duty with little over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of spiritual joy, and sensible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and delicacies in prayer, so as we seem to feel some little beam of Heaven and great refreshments from the Spirit of consolation; yet this is not alwaies safe for us to have, neither safe for us to expect and look for: and when we doe, it is apt to make us cool in our enquiries and waitings upon Christ when we want them: It is a running after him, nor for the miracles, but for the loaves; not for the wonderfull things of God, and the desires of pleasing him, but for the pleasures of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our selves. And as we must not judge our devotion to be barren or unfruitful when we want the overflowings of joy running over: so neither must we cease for want of them. If our spirits can serve God choosingly and greedily out of pure conscience of our duty, it is better in it self, and more safe to us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Let him use to soften his spirit with frequent meditation upon s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d and dolorous objects, as of death, the terrours of the day of judgment; fearful judgments upon sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, strange horrid accidents, fear of Gods wrath, the pains of Hell, the unspeakable
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:42503:169"/>
amazements of the damned, the intolerable load of a sad eternity. For whatsoever crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es fear, or makes the spirit to dwell in a religious sadness, is apt to entender the spirit, and make it devout and plyant to any part of duty. For a great fear, when it is ill managed, is the parent of superstition; but a discreet &amp; well guided fear produces religion.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Pray often and you shall pray oftner, and when you are accustomed to a frequent devotion, it will so insensibly unite to your nature and affections, that it will become trouble to omit your usual or appointed prayers: and what you obtain at first by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violence to your inclinations, at last will not be le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t without as great unwillingness as that by which at first it entred. This rule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies not only upon reason derived from the nature of habits, which turn into a second nature, and make their actions easie, frequent and delightful: but it relies upon a reason depending upon the nature &amp; constitution of grace, whose productions are of the same nature with the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>anes to huge trees, from minutes to vast proportions, and from moments to Eternity. But be sure not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your usual prayers without great reason, though without sin it may be done; because after you have omitted something, in a little while you will be past the scruple of that, and begin to be tempted to leave out more: keep your self up to your usu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

certainly riches must deliver me from no evill, if the possession of them cannot take away the longing for them. If any man be thirsty, drink cools him. If he be hungry, eating meat satisfies him; and when a man is cold and calls for a warm cloak, he is pleased if you give it him; but you trouble him, if you load him with six or eight cloaks. Nature rests and sits still when she hath her portion; but that which exceeds it, is a trouble and a burden: and therefore in true Philosophy, No man is rich but he that is poor according to the common account: for when God hath satisfied those needs which he made; that is, all that is naturall, whatsoever is beyond it is thirst &amp; a disease, and unlesse it be sent back again in charity or religion, can serve no end but vice or vanity; it can encrease the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to represent the man poorer, and full of a new and artificiall, unnaturall need; but it never satisfies the need it makes, or makes the man richer. <hi>No wealth can satisfie the covetous desire of wealth.</hi>

thing that is fancied, and all that can be had and all that can be desired, and that we can lust no more: but before we come to the one half of our first wilde desires, we are the bond men of Usurers, and of our worse tyrant appetites, and the tortures of envy and impatience. But I consider that those who drink on still when their thirst is quenched, or eat after they well dined are forced to vomit, not onely their superfluity, but even that which at first was necessary: so those that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet more then they can temperately use, are oftentimes forced to part even with that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony which would have supported their persons in freedom and honour, and have satisfied all their reasonable desire.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Contentednesse is therefore health be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause covetousnesse is a direct sicknesse: &amp; it was wel said of <hi>Aristippus</hi> (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports him) if any man after much eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be full u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>satsfied, he hath no need of more meat or more drink, but of a Physitian; he more needs to be purged then to be filled; and therefore since covetousnesse cannot be satisfied, it must be cured by emptinesse, and evacuation; The man is without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, unlesse he be reduced to the scantling of nature, and the measures of his personall necessity. Give to a poor man a house, and a few cowes, pay his little debt, and set him on work, and he is provided for, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; but when a man enlarges beyond a fair possession and desires another Lordship, you spite him if you let him have it; for by that he is one degree the further off from rest in his desires and satisfaction: and now he
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:42503:185"/>
sees himself in a bigger capacity to a larger for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; &amp; he shall never find his period, till you begin to take away somthing of what he hath: for then he will begin to be glad to keep that which is left; but reduce him to natures mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and there he shall be sure to finde rest: for there noman can desire beyond his belly full, and when he wants that, any one friend or charitable man can cure his poverty; but all the world cannot satisfie his covetousnesse.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Covetousnesse is the most phantasticall and contradictory disease in the whole world, and it must therefore be incurable, because it strives against its own cure. Noman therefore abstains from meat because he is hungry, nor from wine because he loves it and needs it: but the covetous man does so: for he desires it passionately because he sayes he needs it, and when he hath it, he will need it still, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he dares not use it. He gets cloaths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he cannot be without them; but when he hath them, then he can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: as if he needed corn for his granary, and cloaths for his ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe, more then for his back and belly. For covetousness pretends to heap much together for fear of want, and yet after all his pains and purchase, he suffers that really which at first he feared vainly; and by not using what he gets he makes that suffering to be actuall, present, &amp; necessary, which in his lowest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was but future, contingent &amp; possible. It stirs up the desire, and takes away the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of being satisfied. It increases the appetite and will not content it, it swels the <hi>principal</hi> to no purpose, and lessens the <hi>use</hi> to all purposes; desturbing the order of nature,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:42503:185"/>
and the designes of God; making <hi>money</hi> not to be the instrument of exchange or charity, nor corn to feed himself or the poor, nor wool to cloath himself or his brother, nor wine to refresh the sadnesse of the afflicted, nor his oyl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make his own countenance cheerfull: but all these to look upon, and to tell over, &amp; to take accounts by &amp; make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self considerable, and wondered at by fools, that while he lives he may be called Rich, and when he dyes may be accounted Miserable, &amp; like the Dish-makers of <hi>China,</hi> may leave a greater heap of dirt for his Nephews, while he himself hath a new lot fallen to him in the portion of <hi>Dives</hi>: But thus the Asse carried wood and sweet herbs to the Baths, but was never washed or perfumed himself the heaped up sweets for others, while himself was filthy with smoak and ashes. And yet it is conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; If the man can be content to feed hardly, and labour extremely, and watch carefully, and suffer affronts and disgrace, that he may get money more then he uses in his temperate and just needs, with how much ease might this man be happy? and with how great uneasinesse and trouble does he make himself miserable? For he takes pains to get content, and when he might have it, he lets it go. He might better be content with a vertuous and quiet poverty, then with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial, troublesome and vitious: The same diet and a lesse labour would at first make him happy, and for ever after rewardable.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The sum of all is that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sayes; <hi>Covetousnesse is Idolatry</hi>; that is, it is an admiring money for it self, not for its
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:42503:186"/>
use; it relyes upon money, and loves it more then it loves God and religion: and <hi>it is the root of all evil</hi>: it teaches men to be cruel and crafty, industrious in evil, full of care and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: it devours young heirs, and grindes the face of the poor, and undoes those who spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially belong to Gods protection, helplesse, craftlesse and innocent people; it inquires into our parents age, and longs for the death of our friends: it makes friendship an art of rapine, and changes a partner into a Vultur, and a companion into a thief; and after all this it is for no good to it self, for it dare not spend those heaps of treasure which it snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and men hate Serpents and Basilisks worse then Lyons and Bears; for these kill because they need the prey, but they sting to death and eat not. <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <head>SECT. IX. Of Repentance.</head>
               <p>Repentance of all things in the World makes the greatest change: it changes things in Heaven and Earth; for it changes
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:42503:187"/>
the whole man from sin to grace, from vitious habits to holy customes, from unchast bodies to Angelical soules, from Swine to Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, from drunkenness to sober counsels; and God himself, <hi>with whom is no variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or shadow of change,</hi> is pleased by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending to our weak understandings, to say, that he changes also upon mans repentance, that he alters his decrees, revokes his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, cancels the bils of accusation, throwes the Records of shame and sorrow from the Court of Heaven, and lifts up the sinner from the grave to life, from his prison to a throne, from Hell and the guilt of eternal torture, to Heaven and to a title to never ceasing fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities. If we be <hi>bound on earth,</hi> we shall <hi>be bound in Heaven</hi>; if we be absolved here, we shall be loosed there; if we repent, God will repent, and not send the evil upon us which we have deserved.</p>
               <p>But repentance is a conjugation and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of many duties; and it contains in it all the parts of a holy life, from the time of our returne to the day of our death inclusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and it hath in it some things specially relating to the sins of our former dayes, which are now to be abolished by special arts, and have obliged us to special labours, and brought in many new necessities, and put us into a very great deal of danger; and because it is a duty consisting of so many parts and so much imployment, it also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires much time, and leaves a man in the same degree of hope of pardon, as is his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution to the state of righteousness &amp; holy living, for which we covenanted in Baptism.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:42503:188"/>For we must know that there is but one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in a mans whole life, if repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be taken in the proper, and strict E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall Covenant sense, and not after the ordinary understanding of the word: That is, we are but once to change our whole state of life, from the power of the Devil and his intire possession, from the state of sin and death, from the body of corruption, to the life of grace, to the possession of Jesus, to the kingdome of the Gospel; and this is done in the baptisme of water, or in the baptisme, of the spirit when the first right comes to be verified by Gods grace coming upon us, and by our obedience to the heavenly calling, we working together with God. After this change, if ever wee fall into the contrary state, and be wholly estranged from God and Religion, and profess our selves servants of unrighteousness, God hath made no more covenant of restitution to us, there is no place left for any more repentance, or intire change of condition, or new birth: a man can be regenerated but once: and such are voluntary, malicious Apostates, Witches, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate impenitent persons, and the like: But if we be overtaken by infirmity, or enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the marches or borders of this estate, and commit a grievous sin, or ten, or twenty, so we be not in the intire possession of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, we are for the present in a damnable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if we dye; but if we live we are in a recoverable condition; for so we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent often: we repent or rise from death but once, but from sickness many times; and by the grace of God we shall be pardoned if
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:42503:188"/>
so we repent. But our hopes of pardon are just as is the repentance, which if it be time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hearty, industrious and effective, God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: not by weighing graues or scruples, but by estimating the great proportions of our life; a hearty endevour &amp; an effectual ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral change shall get the pardon; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable infirmities, and past evils, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent imperfections, and short interruptions, against which we watch, and pray, and strive, being put upon the accounts of the crosse, and payed for by the holy Jesus. This is the state and condition of repentance; its parts and actions must be valued according to the following rules.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Acts and parts of Repentance.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. He that repents truly is greatly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful for his past sins; not with a superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial sigh or tear, but a pungent afflictive sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; such a sorrow as hates the sin so much, that the man would choose to dye rather then act it any more: This sorrow is called in Scripture [<hi>a weeping sorely,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 13 17. Ioel 2.13. Ezek. 27 31. Iames 4.9.</note> 
                     <hi>a weeping with bitternesse of heart, a weeping day and night, a sorrow of heart, a breaking of the spirit, mourning like a dove, and chattering like a swallow</hi>:] and we may read the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and manner of it by the lamentations and sad accents of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> when he wept for the sins of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by the heart breaking of <hi>David,</hi> when he mourned for his murder and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery: and the bitter weeping of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> after the shameful denying of his Master. * The expression of this sorrow differs
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:42503:189"/>
according to the temper of the body, the sex, the age, and circumstance of action, and the motive of sorrow, and by many accidental tendernesses, or masculine hardnesses; and the repentance is not to be estimated by the tears, but by the grief; and the grief is to be valued not by the sensitive trouble, but by the cordial hatred of the sin and ready actual dereliction of it, and a resolution and real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting its consequent temptations. Some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can shed tears for nothing, some for any thing; but the proper and true effects of a godly sorrow are; fear of the divine judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, apprehension of Gods displeasure, watchings amd strivings against sin, patiently enduring the cross of sorrow (which God sends as their punishment) in accusation of our selves in perpetually begging pardon, in mean and base opinions of our selves, and in all the natural productions from these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our temper and constitution: for if we be apt to weep in other accidents, it is ill if we weep not also in the sorrows of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: not, that weeping is of it self a duty, but that sorrow, if it be as great, will be still expressed in as great a manner.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our sorrow for sins must retain the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi> of our sins, though <hi>not the equality</hi>; we have no particular measures of sins: we know not which is greater, of sacrilege or Superstition, Idolatry or Covetousness, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion or Witchcraft; and therefore God ties us not to nice measures of sorrow, but onely that wee keep the general Rules of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; that is, that a great sin have a great grief; a smaller crime being to be washed off with a lesser shower.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:42503:189"/>3. Our sorrow for sins is then best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of for its degree,<note place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4. True repentance is a punishing du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and acts its sorrow, and judges and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the sin by voluntary submitting to such sadnesses as God sends on us, or (to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the judgement of God) by judging our selves, and punishing our bodies and our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits by such instruments of piety as are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome to the body: such as are, fasting, watching, long prayers, troublesome postures in our prayers, expensive almes, and all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts of humiliation. For he that must judge himself, must condemn himself if he be guilty; and if he be condemned he must be punished; and if he be so judged, it will help to prevent the judgement of the Lord,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.31.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> instructing us in this particular. But I before intimated that the <hi>punishing actions</hi> of repentance are onely actions of sorrow, and therefore are to make up the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it. For our grief may be so full of trouble as to outweigh all the burdens of fasts and bodily afflictions, and then the other are the less necessary; and when they are used, the benefit of them is to obtain of God a remission or a lessening of such temporal judgments which God hath decreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the sins, as it was in the case of <hi>Ahab</hi>: but the sinner is not by any thing of this reconciled to the eternal favour of God; for as yet, this is but the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to Repentance.</p>

For, confession of our sins to God can signify nothing of it self in its direct na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: He sees us when we act them, and keeps a record of them; and we forget them unless he reminds us of them by his grace: so <hi>that to confess them to God does not funish us, or make us asham'd,</hi> but <hi>confession to him, if it proceeds from shame and sorrow, and is an act of humility and self condemnation,</hi> and is a laying open our wounds for cure, then it is a duty God delights in: in all which circumstances, because we may very much be helped if we take in the assistance of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Guide; therefore the church of God in all ages hath commended, and in most ages enjoyn'd <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p n="3">3. To this end Christ was <hi>made a Priest for ever</hi>: he was initiated or consecrated on the cross, and there began his Priesthood, which was to last till his coming to judgment. It began on earth, but was to last and be offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated in Heaven, where he sits perpetually, representing and exhibiting to the Father that great effective sacrifice (which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on the cross) to eternall and never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purposes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As Christ is pleased to represent to his Father that great Sacrifice as a means of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement

As the ministers of the Sacrament do in a Sacramental manner present to God the sacrifice of the cross, by being imitators of Christs intercession; so the people are sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers too in their manner; for besides that, by saying <hi>Amen,</hi> they joyn in the act of him that ministers, and make it also to be their own: so when they eat and drink the consecrated and blessed Elements worthily, they receive Christ within them, and therefore may also offer him to God, while in their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of obedience and thanksgiving they present themselves to God with Christ whom they have spiritually received, that is, themselves with that which will make them gracious and acceptable.

No man must dare to approach to the holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper if he be in a state of any one sin, that is, unless he have entred into the state of repentance, that is, of sorrow and amendment; least it be said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, as it was concerning <hi>Judas,</hi> the hand of him that betraid me is with me on the Table: and he that receiveth Christ into an impure soul or body, first turns his most excellent nourishment into poyson, and then feeds upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every communicant must first have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined himself, that is, tried the condition &amp; state of his soul, searched out the secret ulcers, enquired out its weaknesses and indiscreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all those aptnesses where it is expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to temptation, that by finding out its diseases he may finde a cure, and by discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:42503:197"/>
dust of the Tabernacle in the waters of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie; it will make the belly to swell, and the thigh to rot: it will not convey Christ to us, but the Devill will enter and dwell there, till with it he returns to his dwelling of torment. Remember alwaies that after a great sin or after a habit of sins, a man is not soon made clean; and no unclean thing must come to this Feast. It is not the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two or three dayes that can render a person capable of this banquet: For in this feast, all Christ, and Christs passion, and all his graces, the blessings and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his sufferings are conveyed: nothing can fit us for this, but what can unite us to Christ, and obtain of him to present our needs to his heavenly Father: this Sacrament can no otherwise be celebrated but upon the same terms on which we may hope for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Heaven it self.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When we have this generall and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably necessary preparation, we are to make our souls more adorn'd and trimm'd up with circumstances of pious actions, and speciall devotions, setting apart some porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our time immediately before the day of solemnity according as our great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions will permit; and this time is special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be spent in actions of repentance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our sins, renewing our purposes of holy living, praying for pardon of our fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and for those graces which may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the like sadnesses for the time to come; meditation upon the passion, upon the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love of God expressed in so great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious manners of redemption; and indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:42503:197"/>
in all acts of virtue which may build our souls up into a Temple fit for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ himself and the inhabitation of the holy Spirit.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The celebration of the holy Sacrament being the most solemn prayer, joyned with the most effectuall instrument of its accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, must suppose us in the love of God and in charity with all the World: and therefore we must before every Communion especially, remember what differences or jealousies are between us and any one else; and recompose all disunions, and cause right understandings between each other; offering to satisfie whom we have injur'd and to forgive them who have injur'd us, without thoughts of resuming the quarrel when the solemnity is over; for that is but to rake the embers in light and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick ashes: it must be quenched, and a holy flame enkindled: no fires must be at all, but the fires of love and zeal: and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of incense will send up a sweet perfume, and make atonement for us.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When the day of the feast is come, lay aside all cares and impertinencies of the World, and remember that this is thy <hi>Souls day</hi>; a day of traffique and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with Heaven. Arise early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 1. Give God thanks for the approach of so great a blessing. 2. Confess thy own unworthiness to admit so Divine a Guest. 3 Then remember and deplore thy sins which have made thee so unworthy. 4. Then confess Gods goodness and take sanctuary there, and upon him place thy

hopes, 5. And invite him to thee with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed acts of love, of holy desire, of hatred of his enemy, sin. 6. Make oblation of thy self wholy to be disposed by him, to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of him, to his providence and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and pray him to enter, and dwell there for ever: And after this with joy and holy fear, and the forwardness of love, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress thy self to the receiving of <hi>him,</hi> to whom &amp; by whom, and for whom, all faiths and all hope, and all love in the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, both in Heaven and Earth is designed; <hi>him,</hi> whom Kings and Queens, and whole Kingdomes are inlove with, and count it the greatest honour in the World, that their Crowns and Scepters are laid at his holy feet.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When the holy man stands at the <hi>Table of blessing</hi> and ministers the rite of consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then do as the Angels do, who behold and love, and wonder, that the Son of <hi>God</hi> should become food to the souls of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; that he who cannot suffer any change of <hi>

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:42503:198"/>
glories that although they are made so obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that each eye may behold them, yet they are also so deep, that no thought can fathome them: But so it hath pleased him to make these mysteries to be <hi>sensible,</hi> because the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and depth of the mercy is <hi>not intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible</hi>; that while we are ravished and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the infiniteness of so vast and mysterious a mercy, yet we may be as sure of it, as of that thing we see and feel, &amp; smell and taste; but yet is so great, that we cannot understand it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. These holy mysteries are offered to our senses, but not to be placed under our feet; they are sensible, but not common: and therefore as the weakness of the Elements adds wonder to the excellency of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: so let our reverence and venerable u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of them adde honour to the Elements, and acknowledge the glory of he mysterie, and the Divinity of the mercy. Let us receive the consecrated Elements with all devotion, and humility of body and spirits; and do this honour to it, that it be the first food we eat, and the first beverage we drink that day, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be in case of sickness, or other great necessity: and that your body and soul both be prepared to its reception with abstinence from secular pleasures,<note place="margin">

patience, and joy, and sanctified riches, or a cheerfull poverty &amp; liberty, and whatsoever else is a blessing, was purchased for us by Christ in his death and resurrection, and in his intercession in Heaven: and this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being that to our particulars, which the great mysteries are in themselves, and by designe to all the world, if we receive worthily we shall receive any of those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, according as God shall choose for us; and he will not onely choose with more wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but also with more affection then we can for our selves.</p>
                  <p>After all this, it is advised by the Guides of souls wise men and pious, that all persons should commu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>icate very often, even as often as they can without excuses or delayes: Every thing that puts us from so holy an imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when we are moved to it, being either a sin or an imperfection; an infirmity or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and an unactiveness of Spirit. All Christian people must come: They indeed that are in the state of sin must not come <hi>so,</hi> but yet they must come: First they must quit their state of death, and then partake of the bread of life. They that are at enmity with their neighbours must come, that is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for their not coming; onely they must not bring their enmity along with them, but leave it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then come.
