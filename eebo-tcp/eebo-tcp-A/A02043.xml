         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to Å¿et forth the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition

tongue: I thought good, not to meddle any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that waye, Å¿eeing Å¿o good an entrance was
made vnto it: But neither Å¿eeing nor hearing of
any that had giuen forth any Å¿ermons or lectures,
vpon the articles of our ChriÅ¿tian faith, a thing as
neceÅ¿Å¿arie as the other, I was the more embolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Å¿et this treatiÅ¿e forth, that the Å¿imple and

benefite to profite themÅ¿elues withall, might haue
the true and playne meaning of euery article of
their faith, as they haue the expoÅ¿ition of the
Lordes prayer, and ten Commandements. For if
this Creede, commonly called the Creede of the
ApoÅ¿tles, Å¿hall onely be Å¿ayde without booke, and
rehearÅ¿ed of the people, without the meaning of
it in more words: then they can not take Å¿uch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

<pb facs="tcp:10917:3"/>
out of theÅ¿e articles as were requiÅ¿ite, becauÅ¿e
they do not vnderÅ¿tande them. And Å¿o great and
excellent myÅ¿teries lying hid, Å¿hal do no good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e
they are not opened and reuealed to the
Å¿impler Å¿ort. The cauÅ¿e that moued me to preÅ¿ent
theÅ¿e my firÅ¿t fruits vnto your Honour, was, That
partly you had heard them read vnto you, &amp; your
Honors accepting of them as fauoring the trueth
Å¿hall incourage others to doe the like, and reade
them more diligently. I haue not laboured to be
curious in this matter, but Å¿o plaine as the weakeÅ¿t
of capacitie might eaÅ¿ely vnderÅ¿tande: for whoÅ¿e
Å¿ake, and not for the learned I was willing to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h
this worke, according to that talent that the
Lorde in mercy hath committed vnto me his Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
for the building vp of his Å¿pirituall temple. I
doubt not, but by the working of Gods holy Å¿pirit
in you in reading of theÅ¿e articles nowe and then,
your Honour, (being voyde of waightier matters
and affayres, when leaÅ¿ure Å¿hall Å¿erue,) you Å¿hall
finde Å¿ome comfort and conÅ¿olation in them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be playne, yet are they true, &amp; neede
no eloquence to Å¿et them forth: for trueth Å¿eeketh
no corners to hide her Å¿elfe in: Onely her feare is
leaÅ¿t Å¿he Å¿hould be hid. I graunt, it might Å¿eeme a
needleÅ¿Å¿e and fruitleÅ¿Å¿e thing to write bookes and
publiÅ¿he them in theÅ¿e dayes, wherein are Å¿uch
Å¿tore that nowe bookes lacke readers, rather then
readers want bookes: but if a man conÅ¿ider well
with him Å¿elfe, he Å¿hall finde that a great many of
them tende not Å¿o much to Å¿et forth godlines, as
wantonnes: neither do they profit the Church and
common wealth, but rather hurt and hinder it as
much as in them lyeth, Å¿o that it had bene better
<pb facs="tcp:10917:3"/>
that a great many of them had bene Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ed
and neuer bene written. They hurt many, for they
leade yong men, (vnleÅ¿Å¿e Gods Å¿pirit guide them
the better) to vtter deÅ¿truction. TheÅ¿e are not the
bookes that teach young men, which are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
wanton and wilde, and giuen to luÅ¿tes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine
from libertie of the fleÅ¿h: but rather giue
them the bridle to theÅ¿e wanton luÅ¿tes and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites:
and pitie it is they Å¿hould bee Å¿uffered in a
ChriÅ¿tian co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon wealth. TheÅ¿e idle bookes teach
not a man to amende and correct his wayes, but
vtterly to peruert them. A young man therefore
Å¿hall clenÅ¿e his wayes, not by theÅ¿e meanes, but by
ruling himÅ¿elf according to the word of the Lord,
as the Prophet Dauid hath forewarned, PÅ¿al. 119.
Å¿o then although the Å¿tore of bookes in our dayes
is great, yet the number of them that encreaÅ¿e
true godlineÅ¿Å¿e, is not Å¿o great, but that it may be
augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ted. And albeit Å¿ome one booke pleaÅ¿e not
euery man, yet another may, Å¿eeing there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
and diuers giftes giuen to edifie, that all men
may be without excuÅ¿e before the Lorde. If any
find fault and Å¿ay, This writer is too hard and hye
for my capacity, he may haue an eaÅ¿ier: if this
man bee too eloquent and fine, he may haue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that is more Å¿imple and playne: for God be
thanked, there is great varietye of giftes in the
Church of ChriÅ¿t: and as it is in the body naturall
of men that al members are not alike, nor haue
the Å¿ame function, yet all are neceÅ¿Å¿ary: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the foote be not Å¿o excellent a member as
the hand or the eye, yet for the vÅ¿e of the body, it
is as neceÅ¿Å¿ary &amp; profitable: neither can the head
Å¿ay to the foote, I haue no neede of thee, but one
<pb facs="tcp:10917:4"/>
hath neede of the helpe of another for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole: So it is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> myÅ¿tical body of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Church, Å¿ome haue more excellent giftes then
others, and Å¿ome may be likened to the head, Å¿ome
to the eye, and Å¿ome to the hand: other of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
giftes to the foote and to the legge which yet
Å¿urely can not be deÅ¿piÅ¿ed or lightly Å¿et by, conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the body can not want them: neither is
this onely to be Å¿eene in the myÅ¿ticall body of
the Church, wherein Å¿ome are paÅ¿tors, Å¿ome doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
Å¿ome Deacons, and Å¿ome haue the gift of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
Å¿ome of knowledge, Å¿ome of vtterance,
&amp; Å¿ome of tongues: But this may be perceiued in
the body of the common wealth, wherein Å¿ome
are kinges and rulers, appoynted of God to bee
heades ouer others, and Å¿ome are crafteÅ¿men, and
artificers, Å¿ome huÅ¿bandmen and plowmen farre
inferiour to the other, and yet notwithÅ¿tanding, as
neceÅ¿Å¿ary is the poore labouring man for the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
body, as is the magiÅ¿trate and Å¿uperiour: for if
all Å¿hould rule, who Å¿houlde obey: if all againe
Å¿hould obey, who Å¿hould rule or gouerne? but nowe
the Lorde hath Å¿o tempered and diÅ¿poÅ¿ed theÅ¿e
thinges in his infinite wiÅ¿edome, that there Å¿hould
be no diÅ¿order, and that euery one Å¿hould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detted
and bounde to another: that Å¿o, loue and
vnity might be kept and maynteyned in al. For no
one man hath all giftes giuen vnto him, that hee
might Å¿tande in neede of his neighbour, and loue
him the better, hauing that gift which hee Å¿eeth
him Å¿elfe to be deÅ¿titute of. Thus, being willing

here Å¿et forth Å¿o plainely, that thou mayeÅ¿t ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ily
vnderÅ¿tande it, if the Lorde Å¿hall giue his
grace to thee, &amp; open thine eyes to Å¿ee: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e
nothing can be eaÅ¿ie to any man, but an
open booke Å¿halbe as Å¿ealed vnto men, except
the Å¿pirit reueale it vnto them, which he will
doe, no doubt, if thou Å¿eeke it by humble and
earneÅ¿t prayer to God, in his Å¿onnes name. For
Å¿urely this is the cauÅ¿e, why many reading the
Scriptures vnderÅ¿tand them not, becauÅ¿e they
come to them with vnprepared heartes, not
Å¿ubdued with humilitie, but preÅ¿uming with
their naturall witte, to vnderÅ¿tand the myÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in them conteined. But fleÅ¿h &amp; blood doth
not reueale theÅ¿e Å¿ecret and hid thinges vnto
vs. Other reade them without prayer, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand
them, other Å¿ome reade them but to
diÅ¿pute, and talke of them with the learned,
and not to amende their liues, being detected
by them, but onely to knowe them, and let the
practiÅ¿e goe. But theÅ¿e men Å¿o doing, can not
be bleÅ¿Å¿ed Luke 11. cap. Wherfore dearely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
ChriÅ¿tian, I exhort thee to reade the
Å¿criptures, and all other bookes, that tende to
the declaration of the Å¿criptures, with a Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
eye, and penitent heart, not thinking or
preÅ¿uming any thing of thy Å¿elfe, for the wind
<pb facs="tcp:10917:6"/>
bloweth where it listeth, as our Å¿auiour Å¿ayth,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 3. And theÅ¿e diuine thinges are moÅ¿t
commonly had from the wiÅ¿e and men of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tanding,
and opened by the Å¿pirit vnto li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
babes. Matth. 11. that is to Å¿uch as are
humble in their owne conceyte, and in their
owne eyes. For the holy GhoÅ¿t Å¿ayth: Them
that be meeke will hee guide in iudgement,
and teach the humble his waye. PÅ¿al. 26. So
then the humble Å¿halbe exalted, and they all
that exalt them Å¿elues Å¿halbe brought lowe.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore we come to Å¿peake
of the meaning of theÅ¿e
wordes, it Å¿hall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿e
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿ider in a word
or two, who made this
ChriÅ¿tian order and forme
of our beliefe. The generall and common
opinion receaued with the whole conÅ¿ent of
the Church, is, that the xii. ApoÅ¿tles of our
Å¿auiour IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, made this Creede, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one an article, as a godly writer of our
time, one <hi>Aretius</hi> in his booke of queÅ¿tions
doeth Å¿hew. Therefore it is called the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles
Creede. But whether it were they or
no that made it, or any other, it is no great
matter, Å¿eeing it is all the vndoubted trueth
of Gods worde, &amp; euery poynt of it agreeth
with the reÅ¿t of the holy Å¿criptures written
with the Spirit of ChriÅ¿t. We haue many
bookes in the olde &amp; new TeÅ¿tament, which
are written for our conÅ¿olation &amp; comfort,
and that by the finger of God, but yet we
knowe not the names of thoÅ¿e men that
<pb facs="tcp:10917:8"/>
wrote them, as the booke of the Iudges, the
booke of Kinges, and the Chronicles, and
Å¿uch like: and in the newe TeÅ¿tament the
EpiÅ¿tle to the Ebrewes. TheÅ¿e all are the
holy worde of God, but yet we knowe not
the authors of them. And it Å¿eemeth that the
holy GhoÅ¿t woulde haue their names Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ed
and vnknowen, becauÅ¿e we Å¿houlde
receiue all Scripture alike, and with the
Å¿ame authoritie which proceedeth from the
mouth of God, making no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons,
or choyÅ¿e of men, when all is trueth
that is written, and that we Å¿houlde not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider
Å¿o much, who Å¿peaketh or writeth a
thing, as what is Å¿poken &amp; written vnto vs.
Thus much for the writers of this worke.
Nowe let vs conÅ¿ider the thing it Å¿elfe.
This Creede hath foure partes, the firÅ¿t
is of our faith, &amp; beliefe in God the Father,
the firÅ¿t perÅ¿on in Trinitie: the Å¿econde is
of our truÅ¿t and beliefe in God the Sonne
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t our Å¿auiour, the Å¿econd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on
in Trinitie: the third is of our faith in
the holy GhoÅ¿t, the power of God, which
is the thirde perÅ¿on in Trinitie: the fourth
and laÅ¿t parte is of the holy and Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿all
Church of ChriÅ¿t, and of thoÅ¿e things
that are to be beleued concerning the Å¿ame,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:8"/>
which are contayned in the laÅ¿t three arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which are annexed and ioyned vnto the
Church, as <hi>The remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urrection
of the bodie, and the life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laÅ¿ting.</hi>
TheÅ¿e are the benefites which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
the Church. This is the diuiÅ¿ion of
the Creede. Out of the firÅ¿t article we haue
to note theÅ¿e two things: firÅ¿t that we muÅ¿t
beleeue in God: Å¿econdly, what maner of
God it is, in whome we doe beleeue. The
meaning of theÅ¿e wordes is this, I the Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
and childe of God, I, I Å¿ay, &amp; not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for me, doe beleeue, hope and truÅ¿t in
one almightie, eternall &amp; euerliuing God,
which is not only a God of might vnto me,
to be able to do all thinges, but a moÅ¿t mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
father in IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, moÅ¿t willing
and ready to helpe me in al troubles and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿ities
of this life, when I Å¿hall cry &amp; call
vnto him. FirÅ¿t therefore we learne here to
beleeue &amp; truÅ¿t in God only, and not in any
creature whatÅ¿oeuer, for they cannot helpe
vs, as Dauid Å¿ayeth in his PÅ¿almes, <hi>Vaine
is the helpe of man. It is thou that Å¿aueÅ¿t
me from mine aduerÅ¿aries.</hi> And here note,
that there is a great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce betwene theÅ¿e
three, to beleeue God, &amp; to beleeue there is a
God, &amp; to beleeue in God, the deuils beleue
<pb facs="tcp:10917:9"/>
the firÅ¿t &amp; the Å¿econd, that God is true of his
word and promiÅ¿e, which is, to beleeue God,
&amp; they alÅ¿o beleeue there is one God and no
moe, and tremble, as S. Iames the ApoÅ¿tle
Å¿ayth, Chap. 2. 19. but they beleeue not the
third, that is, in God, which is as much as to
embrace &amp; acknowledge him for our good
God, and to Å¿ticke to him, and to his worde
only. This is proper to the Elect &amp; children
of God, not to the deuils and reprobates,
which doe not truÅ¿t in him. For they lacke a
true iuÅ¿tifying faith, which is defined to be
a Å¿ure truÅ¿t in the mercies of God &amp; his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es,
made vnto vs in IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t his
Sonne, (by whom he hath adopted vs) that
he wil be mercifull vnto vs, &amp; forgiue vs all
our Å¿innes. This is faith, &amp; this is it that we
muÅ¿t haue, when we Å¿ay, <hi>I beleeue in God.</hi>
For faith muÅ¿t looke vnto God, &amp; not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man or angel, or Å¿aint in heauen. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Paul Å¿aid to the iayler, aÅ¿king howe he
might be Å¿aued, when he had abuÅ¿ed &amp; cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
handled the ApoÅ¿tles,<note place="margin">Actes 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Beleeue,</hi> Å¿aieth he,
<hi>in the Lorde IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and thou Å¿halt
be Å¿aued.</hi> Surely he could not haue Å¿ayde,
Beleeue in ChriÅ¿t, vnleÅ¿Å¿e he had bene very
God: and marke howe he Å¿ayeth not, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, but, Beleeue in the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:9"/>
Lord IeÅ¿us, and thou Å¿halt be Å¿aued, as it is
Å¿ayde here in our Creede, I beleeue in
God. This that we muÅ¿t beleeue in God, is
warranted by our Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t, Å¿aying to
his diÅ¿ciples, <hi>Beleeue in God, let not your
heartes be troubled, Iohn</hi> 14. So that this
doctrine to beleeue in God &amp; in no other, is
a doctrine of comfort to al the godly, and to
Å¿ettle their hearts that they be not troubled
or caried away with vaine perÅ¿uaÅ¿ions of
men and of Angels, which Paul forbiddeth,
<hi>ColoÅ¿.</hi> 2. But here may a queÅ¿tion be made,
why we Å¿ay not, as in the Lordes prayer in
the plurall number, Our Father, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
vs our treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿es: Å¿o here alÅ¿o in like
Å¿ort, why Å¿ay we not, We beleeue in God?
FirÅ¿t I anÅ¿were, that is a prayer to God, &amp;
this is a confeÅ¿Å¿ion of our faith. Then I Å¿ay
the caÅ¿e is not all one or alike. For I may
pray for another man,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> and am commanded
Å¿o to doe, becauÅ¿e we are al members of the
Å¿ame body of ChriÅ¿t, Å¿o that my prayer may
helpe and profit him. But I can not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
for another man, neither Å¿hal my faith
and beliefe profit another man, except he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
him Å¿elfe the promiÅ¿es of ChriÅ¿t: for
euery man Å¿hall be Å¿aued by his owne faith,
as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet Habakuk Å¿aith, <hi>Chap. 2. The
<pb facs="tcp:10917:10"/>
iuÅ¿t man Å¿hal liue by his own faith.</hi> And this
notably confoundeth &amp; reproueth that fond
and falÅ¿e opinion of the papiÅ¿tes, which Å¿ay
that it is inough to beleeue generally as the
church beleeueth, not knowing how or what
to beleeue. This Å¿ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce alÅ¿o reproueth and
conuinceth another hereÅ¿ie of theirs which
Å¿ay, that a man may be iuÅ¿tified by his owne
works. Here it is Å¿ayd, The iuÅ¿t Å¿hall liue by
his faith, and not by his good workes or
deedes. And when Habacuk Å¿aith, his faith,
he meaneth not that faith is of our Å¿elues,
but that faith which doth Å¿aue vs, is within
vs in our hearts, &amp; not without vs in other
men, meaning neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, that faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
from God aboue, and not of vs. As
Iames chap. 1. And this doth teach vs to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the mercies of God vnto our Å¿elues, Å¿ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I beleeue as well as other men, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God
wil help me, &amp; be my father. This is a great
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fort which the godly only haue, and not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
wicked, as Dauid Å¿aith, The Lorde is his
Lorde as wel as he is a lord to other. Thus
much on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> we muÅ¿t beleeue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, in God
only. Now Å¿eco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dly conÅ¿ider w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your Å¿elues
in what maner of god you doe beleeue and
truÅ¿t: not in Å¿uch a one as the Paynims did,
that could not help them, as Iupiter, Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:10"/>
Diana and Å¿uch like, which did appoint
a multitude of them to gouerne and guyde
the worlde, becauÅ¿e they thought that one
was not able ynough of himÅ¿elfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made one for heauen, as Iupiter, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the Å¿ea, as Neptune. One for hell
as Pluto. One for the fire as Vulcan. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are wee taught here to beleeue in Å¿uch
a god as the wicked IÅ¿raelites did, called
Baal, which could not heare them when
they cryed vnto him, as it is in the booke of
the Kings, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Elias reproueth, 3. <hi>Kings.
18. Chap.</hi> Of Å¿uch Idols and gods the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Dauid Å¿peaketh, and derideth them &amp;
their worÅ¿hippers, <hi>PÅ¿al. 115. Saying, they
haue mouthes and Å¿peake not, eares and
heare not, eyes &amp; Å¿ee not, noÅ¿es and Å¿mell
not, hands and handle not, feete and walke
not, neither make they a Å¿ound with their
throte.</hi> Neither haue we Å¿uch pety gods of
Å¿tone and wood, as the papiÅ¿ts haue their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.
But our God in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> we do confeÅ¿Å¿e
that we beleeue, is Å¿uch a one as is a father,
for his goodnes and mercie: and almightie,
for his Å¿trength and power. This doth Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
meane, when hee doeth Å¿peake of his
great God, and Å¿etteth him againÅ¿t al other
falÅ¿e gods of the idolaters, Å¿aying, <hi>as for
<pb facs="tcp:10917:11"/>
our God, he is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.</hi> As if he would Å¿ay,
he is a moÅ¿t mightie God, and both what Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
hee will, no man can hinder or let his
power. This as it is a great comfort to all
the godly, to haue Å¿uch a God to ayde them
at all neede, Å¿o it is a terror to the wicked
to conÅ¿ider that they haue to doe with Å¿uch
a God as is omnipotent, able to beate them
to peeces and powder, when they reÅ¿iÅ¿t him.
As hee did mightily deÅ¿troy Pharao, Å¿o did
hee wonderfully deliuer his people and
children the IÅ¿raelites out of his handes,
from the read Å¿ea. So he declared him Å¿elfe
an omnipotent father. We Å¿ee then here as
in other places, how God ioyneth his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and iuÅ¿tice to terrifie, and alÅ¿o his mercie
and clemency to comfort. I Å¿ay they are put
both together, euen to terrifie the godly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they Å¿hould not commit Å¿inne, but feare
to offende Å¿uch a mightie Father. So it is
Å¿aid in the beginning of our prayer, Our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to comfort vs, but it is Å¿aid alÅ¿o, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
to magnifie his power &amp; greatnes ouer
al things. LikewiÅ¿e in the giuing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Law
it is Å¿aide, Heare O IÅ¿rael, I am y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde,
great &amp; terrible, no doubt, to put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in mind
to feare him reuerently, and not to preÅ¿ume
vpon him. But yet he addeth comfort after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:11"/>
Å¿aying, Thy God, to deliuer thee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
which hath bene thy God already.
Thus we Å¿ee that both muÅ¿t goe together,
Gods iuÅ¿tice, and Gods mercie, as Dauid
Å¿aid, <hi>Thy rod &amp; thy Å¿taffe, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fort me,
PÅ¿al.</hi> 23. Wee call him father, not in reÅ¿pect
of our creation, for Å¿o he is our Maker and
Creator: neither in reÅ¿pect of our gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for Å¿o he is our Lord and maÅ¿ter: and
thoÅ¿e names are not Å¿o comfortable vnto vs,
becauÅ¿e hee is Å¿o, that is, a Lord and maker,
euen to the wicked and reprobate. But wee
call him father, firÅ¿t in reÅ¿pect of ChriÅ¿t,
which is his onely begotten and beloued
Å¿onne: Then in that we are his children ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opted
in ChriÅ¿t our elder brother, which hath
made vs all Å¿onnes and children to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
father, by his death and paÅ¿Å¿ion, by his
obedience, by his fulfilling of the lawe, and
by his Å¿atiÅ¿faction for our Å¿innes, as Iohn
Å¿aith, <hi>Chap. 3. Behold what loue the father
hath Å¿hewed vnto vs, that we Å¿hould bee
called the Å¿o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>nes of God.</hi> This is a maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
comfort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the God of the whole earth,
the Lord of lords, is a louing father vnto vs.
And this is in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, that wee haue
this dignity &amp; prerogatiue aboue others, not
in our Å¿elues, nor by birth and nature, for Å¿o
<pb facs="tcp:10917:12"/>
we are the Å¿onnes of Gods ire &amp; wrath, of
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, becauÅ¿e of our Å¿inful father Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ing Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> we
name him almighty, we do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ceiue him
to haue Å¿uch a power which he doth not vÅ¿e,
but in Å¿aying this, we confeÅ¿Å¿e and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath al things &amp; creatures vnder
his power &amp; obedience, euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elues,
as we Å¿ee in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> GoÅ¿pel, how they Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿elues to ChriÅ¿t y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿onne of God,
&amp; how he aÅ¿ked leaue, before he could do any
thing to Iob, <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. Again, we muÅ¿t needes
grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, that being omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, and almighty,
he doth all things that are done, he ruleth &amp;
gouerneth heauen &amp; earth, the Å¿ea and hel,
&amp; all things in them, the whole world at his
beck doth bend &amp; yeld it Å¿elf. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our God
being Å¿o mighty, is not an idle God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked do imagine, but diÅ¿poÅ¿eth
al things by his iuÅ¿t &amp; wiÅ¿e prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oeuer

w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out his wil and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿el, no not the flight of

not vphold heauen and earth, yea the whole
world w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his power, it would fal to nothing,
to duÅ¿t &amp; aÅ¿hes: therefore it is Å¿aid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ChriÅ¿t

as Plato &amp; AriÅ¿totle, who greatly
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> derogation &amp; impairing of Gods glory
&amp; power, thought &amp; held that the world was
eternal fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginnings, and neuer made,
neither Å¿hould haue ende. But this is falÅ¿e &amp;
blaÅ¿phemous againÅ¿t God. We learne here
another leÅ¿Å¿on in our faith, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world was
made and had a beginning, and Å¿hall haue an
ending, as MoÅ¿es proueth the one, &amp; Peter
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, 2. <hi>EpiÅ¿t. 3. Chap.</hi> Now by making
of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> and earth, we vnderÅ¿tand al things
conteined in heauen &amp; earth, as the Å¿ea. For
Dauid Å¿aith, <hi>The Å¿ea is his, and he made it,
95. PÅ¿a.</hi> The things in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, as his angels,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things in earth, men, beaÅ¿ts, fiÅ¿hes, foules,
worms, &amp; al other Å¿enÅ¿les creatures whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.
It is therfore, as if we Å¿hould Å¿ay, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of al things, viÅ¿ible which we Å¿ee, &amp; inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
which we Å¿ee not, as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Creed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

of Nice in more fully expreÅ¿Å¿ed. And
this was done, becauÅ¿e of the Heretikes
called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maniches, which did appoynt two
beginnings of things created, the one good,
which was God, and him they made the
beginner of all good thinges, the other they
imagined to be ill, which was the deuil, and
him they Å¿et ouer the euill things, and Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed
him the maker of them. But theÅ¿e
men were deceiued, which thought any ill
thing to be created and made ill at the firÅ¿t,
for the Å¿cripture doth otherwiÅ¿e pronounce
of al things, that they were exceeding good.
GeneÅ¿. 1. But in that any thing is ill, it is
by deprauation and corruption, by the Å¿inne
of man, of Adam, and not by creation: for
the deuill was made an Angel, but he fell
and loÅ¿t his firÅ¿t eÅ¿tate, and Å¿o became a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
and wicked Å¿pirit by his owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and will, as Peter proueth. 2. EpiÅ¿tle
2. Chap. Nowe if the deuill made Å¿ome
things, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> God made not al: but what Å¿aith
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿cripture? <hi>The Lord hath made al things
for his owne Å¿ake:</hi> he Å¿aith not Å¿ome things,
but al: nay he goeth further, &amp; addeth, <hi>euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
wicked for the day of euil.</hi> not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he created
them wicked: for hee made them in Adam
perfit and good: but he hath appointed them
<pb facs="tcp:10917:13"/>
to Å¿erue to his honour and glory: although
they bee veÅ¿Å¿els of wrath, he is glorified in
them after a Å¿ort, although not Å¿o as hee
is glorified in the good. For therefore dyd
he Å¿turre vp Pharao King of Egypt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e
he woulde Å¿hewe his glory vpon him,
Rom. 9. Seeing then God hath made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
he hath made alÅ¿o all the ornaments of
heauen: as the heauenly Å¿pirits, the Sunne,
the Moone, the Starres to gouerne the
earth by their light. For in that we giue
him the creation of the greater, wee muÅ¿t
needes graunt the leÅ¿Å¿er, and hee that can
make the great and huge heauens of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
is able alÅ¿o to make the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
in them of leÅ¿Å¿e importance. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Angels, it is Å¿ufficient for vs to
know, that they were all made of the Lorde
for his wil and pleaÅ¿ure, to be his miniÅ¿tring
Spirites, to execute his commandementes
and iudgements againÅ¿t the wicked, and for
to Å¿erue for thoÅ¿e that Å¿halbe heires of Å¿alua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Hebr. 1. It is but curioÅ¿itie to enquire
of the time of the creation, or of the orders
and eÅ¿tate in heauen. MoÅ¿es telleth vs a
good and Å¿hort leÅ¿Å¿on, that heauen and earth
were made perfect in Å¿ixe dayes, with al the
hoÅ¿tes and furniture of them, and Å¿aieth no
<pb facs="tcp:10917:14"/>
more of this matter, to teache vs Å¿obrietie
in theÅ¿e things, to wade no farther then we
haue the warrant of the worde to beare vs
out. Seeing all other vaine queÅ¿tions are
condemned of the ApoÅ¿tle Saint Paul,
Titus 3. The like is to be vnderÅ¿toode in
making of the earth, to comprehende all
things in the earth, whatÅ¿oeuer I doe Å¿ee,
heare, and vnderÅ¿tande. By the creation of
theÅ¿e thinges celeÅ¿tiall, and terreÅ¿tiall, I
doe conÅ¿ider with my Å¿elfe theÅ¿e foure moÅ¿t
excellent and diuine vertues in God, which
comprehende all the reÅ¿t in them, and to
the which they may bee referred. FirÅ¿t by
the great and wonderfull creation of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerÅ¿all
worlde, I learne to come to the
conÅ¿ideration of his vnÅ¿peakeable power
and greatneÅ¿Å¿e,<note place="margin">Potentia Dei.</note> that he was able without
and payne or labour at all, yea with great
eaÅ¿e and pleaÅ¿ure, to create heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> and earth,
with his onely worde, as the Prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
Å¿ayeth, <hi>He Å¿pake the worde, and it was
done.</hi> O what a great God is this, to be
feared ouer all the earth, for his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
greatneÅ¿Å¿e and MaieÅ¿tie! This doeth
put vs in minde what a mighty God we do
Å¿erue, that wee may from our heart feare
him. The Å¿econde thing to be conÅ¿idered in
<pb facs="tcp:10917:14"/>
this creation generall,<note place="margin">Sapientia Dei.</note> is his infinite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿timable
wiÅ¿edome, in diÅ¿poÅ¿ing Å¿o order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and placing Å¿o Å¿eemely all thinges in
their place and degree, as it is moÅ¿t won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
to beholde, with Å¿uch beautie and
proportion in euery creature, that vnleÅ¿Å¿e
we be too too blockiÅ¿he, we muÅ¿t crye out
with Dauid and Å¿ay, and confeÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>O Lord,
howe wonderfull are thy workes: in wiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
haÅ¿t thou made them all.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
<hi>Great is our Lorde, great is his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
yea his wiÅ¿dome is infinite.</hi> To Å¿ee the
goodly order of heauen, it will make a man
to be aÅ¿tonied at the wiÅ¿edome of his God,
more then the Queene of Saba was, when
Å¿hee came to Å¿ee, and heare the wiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Solomon. For <hi>this wiÅ¿edome
by whome all thinges were made, is the
Sonne of GOD IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, the wiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of his Father, Iohn 1. Hebr.</hi> 1. And
here we learne of this wiÅ¿edome, which he
hath vÅ¿ed and Å¿hewed in the creation, a good
leÅ¿Å¿on for our comfort, that as the Lorde
is almightie, and able to deliuer vs his
children, and Church from the wicked:
Å¿o doeth hee knowe the wayes and meanes
moÅ¿t perfitly and readily howe to doe it at
all times. For his knowledge paÅ¿Å¿eth our
<pb facs="tcp:10917:15"/>
vnderÅ¿tanding farre. Therfore Peter Å¿aid,
<hi>The Lorde knoweth howe to deliuer the
godly out of tentation and trouble, and to
puniÅ¿h the wicked. 2. Pet.</hi> 2. So that when
man can finde no way, no deuice or meane
how to Å¿hift him Å¿elf out of daunger, yet the
Lord by his wiÅ¿edome and knowledge hath
diuers wayes to helpe. Diuers examples of
this are in the holy Scriptures: when Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es
and the IÅ¿raelites were Å¿o entangled
and compaÅ¿Å¿ed about, that there Å¿eemed no
way for them to eÅ¿cape, Å¿o that MoÅ¿es
prayed to the Lorde moÅ¿t earneÅ¿tly to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
them, for he him Å¿elfe Å¿awe no meanes
howe to doe it, being on euery Å¿ide on the
ryght hande and on the left, compaÅ¿Å¿ed in
with the hie hilles, before them was the
great redde Å¿ea, behind them was the huge
hoÅ¿t of Pharao, Å¿o that nowe all hope of
life and Å¿uccour was taken away: then the
Lorde founde a way in the middeÅ¿t of the
Å¿ea, to deliuer his people, and to drowne
his enemies: Å¿o he declared his wiÅ¿edome in
preÅ¿eruing them Å¿o miraculouÅ¿ly. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e
when the virgin Marie dyd not Å¿ee
howe Å¿he Å¿houlde conceyue and bring foorth
a Å¿onne being a mayde, and not knowing
any man, and therefore Å¿ayde to the angel,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:15"/>
Howe Å¿hall this come to paÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿o Å¿trange
and rare a matter? the Lorde founde a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
way howe he brought it to paÅ¿Å¿e, that Å¿he
conceiued by the operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of the holy ghoÅ¿t.
This made Solomon in his Prouerbs, to
Å¿ay, Chapter 21. <hi>There is no wiÅ¿edome,
there is no vnderÅ¿tanding, there is no cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ell
againÅ¿t the Lord.</hi> For he ouerthroweth
the Å¿ubtill fetches of the wiÅ¿edome of this
worlde, as of Ieroboam in his politike
counÅ¿el to make calues, &amp; of Achitophel in
his wilie practiÅ¿es. The PhariÅ¿ees in their
Å¿nare that they had layde for our Sauiour
ChriÅ¿t, were taken them Å¿elues, to their
Å¿hame and reproche. Thus the Lorde Å¿cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
abroade the deuiÅ¿es of the wicked
kings and princes of this worlde, by his
wiÅ¿edome, for theirs is fooliÅ¿hneÅ¿Å¿e to his,
1. Cor. 3. Saint Paul is rauiÅ¿hed with the
conÅ¿ideration of this great wiÅ¿edome, and
cryeth out, Å¿aying, <hi>O the depth of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
&amp; wiÅ¿dome, and knowledge of God,
howe vnÅ¿ercheable are his iudgements, &amp;
his wayes paÅ¿t finding our. Rom.</hi> 11. Wee
muÅ¿t then applie theÅ¿e things to our Å¿elues,
to receiue comfort and conÅ¿olatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> by them.
When we looke vp into heauen, &amp; downe
in the earth, or in the Å¿ea, let vs thinke vpon
<pb facs="tcp:10917:16"/>
the wiÅ¿edome of the Lorde and glorifie him
in it, and Å¿ay, O Lorde, howe wiÅ¿e art thou
in all thy doings, howe great is thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
vnto me: Å¿uch knowledge is too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
for me, it paÅ¿Å¿eth my reache and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
So Å¿aide Dauid, Å¿aye vnto God,
<hi>O how wonderful art thou in thy workes!</hi>
UnleÅ¿Å¿e we doe this, we are vnthankefull
beholders of Gods wiÅ¿edome, if we praiÅ¿e
him not for it. We may Å¿ee it in our owne
Å¿elues, and in others euery day, in our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of our body and Å¿oule, howe wiÅ¿e and
wonderfull hee is. TheÅ¿e thinges we muÅ¿t
meditate vpon dayly and thinke, otherwiÅ¿e
we are no better then bruite beaÅ¿tes, which
Å¿ee them onely and beholde them, but conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
nothing in them. Here we learne our
duetie to our good God.</p>
                  <p>3 Thirdly in the creation of the worlde<note place="margin">Bonitas Dei.</note>
we beholde as it were in a glaÅ¿Å¿e, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e
of God, his mercie towarde all men,
but eÅ¿pecially to the elect and choÅ¿en, that
for them, and their Å¿akes, he hath created
theÅ¿e things, and doeth dayly preÅ¿erue by
his prouidence euerye one of them, Å¿o that
hee hath not made them for him Å¿elfe, I
meane, that hee needed not any of them,
being all Å¿ufficient in him Å¿elfe, moÅ¿t
<pb facs="tcp:10917:16"/>
happie and bleÅ¿Å¿ed, which is meant by his
name <hi>Shaddai,</hi> which Å¿ignifieth that hee
is Å¿ufficient of his owne nature. So that
a true ChriÅ¿tian man may Å¿ay that his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Father hath made all thinges for his
vÅ¿e and benefite, heauen one daye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
him, the earth to maynteyne him, all
creatures to Å¿erue him, the Sunne, Moone
&amp; Starres to lyght him, liuing creatures
to feede him and to recreate him, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
to keepe and to preÅ¿erue him in his
wayes, by his Fatherly appoyntment. O
what great benefites are here, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
of our mercifull Father by his creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all things! Here we learne our duetie
to be thankful to God for them, in the name
of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t his Sonne, to vÅ¿e theÅ¿e be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
to his honour and glorie, to the profit
and commodity of his Church, and our
brethren here with vs. And here I Å¿ee by
Gods goodneÅ¿Å¿e and mercie towarde me,
that hee hath not onely created theÅ¿e things
at the firÅ¿t, but he doeth preÅ¿erue them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
houre by his power: otherwiÅ¿e they
woulde vaniÅ¿he away and come to nothing,
as Dauid Å¿ayeth, <hi>If thou take away thy
breath from them,</hi> That is, his power
from his creatures, <hi>they dye.</hi> So that
<pb facs="tcp:10917:17"/>
here we Å¿ee Gods prouidence ouer vs, and
all things. For he woorketh dayly by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eruing
and keeping his creatures in their
eÅ¿tate, as ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith, <hi>My Father hitherto
woorketh, and I woorke,</hi> by maynteyning
things created. For God is not like a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter
that maketh an houÅ¿e, and Å¿etteth it
vp in deede, but afterwarde neuer perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
Å¿eeth it againe, but leaueth it to the
dweller and owner of it, the maÅ¿ter thereof,
and careth no more for it. If God Å¿houlde
deale Å¿o with vs, it woulde be ill and wrong
with vs: for the deuill woulde dayly deÅ¿troy
vs, if he did not keepe vs and all ours. For
we are not able to keepe our Å¿elues, no not
a minute of an houre. Here therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
in the mercie of God, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
care and prouidence ouer vs and all
his creatures.</p>
                  <p>4 The laÅ¿t thing we learne of the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the worlde, is the iuÅ¿tice of God, how
he gouerneth it rightly in equitie &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the Prophet Å¿ingeth, <hi>All the waies
of the Lord are iudgement &amp; equite.</hi> For
vnleÅ¿Å¿e hee dyd execute his iuÅ¿tice vpon the
wicked, they woulde deÅ¿troy his Church:
but he keepeth them vnder, as it were with
a bridle, and hampereth euen the proude
<pb facs="tcp:10917:17"/>
tyrants and deuils of hell, by his Å¿euere iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tice
Å¿hewed vpon them. So that the Lorde
is iuÅ¿t in all his wayes, yea his wil is a moÅ¿t
perfite rule and patterne of iuÅ¿tice. Dauid
often repeateth this leÅ¿Å¿on, to terrifie the
wicked, <hi>IuÅ¿t art thou, O Lorde, &amp; right are
thy iudgements, PÅ¿alm.</hi> 119. So Å¿ayde the
Emperor Mauricius, being killed by Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas.
This do the wicked confeÅ¿Å¿e the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿elues,
when they feele his heauy hand vpon them
for their Å¿innes and offences, as Pharao did
when the hayle deÅ¿troyed the cattell of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
Å¿aying vnto MoÅ¿es &amp; Aaron, I haue
nowe Å¿inned, the Lorde is righteous, but I
and my people are wicked, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. Thus
the reprobate, whether they will or no, muÅ¿t
confeÅ¿Å¿e the Lorde to be righteous in his
workes. For as the Lord is merciful to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
the Å¿innes of his children that are true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
penitent, and not obÅ¿tinate: Å¿o is he alÅ¿o
a moÅ¿t iuÅ¿t Iudge ouer all the earth, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his Å¿harpe puniÅ¿hments vpon the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
and wilful Å¿inners. The Iudge of the
worlde doeth according to iuÅ¿tice, as Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
Å¿ayde of him, when he was about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troy
Sodoma, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. I delite, Å¿ayth the
Lorde, in iuÅ¿tice, mercy, and iudgement,
<hi>Ierem.</hi> 9. Examples of his iuÅ¿tice he hath
<pb facs="tcp:10917:18"/>
Å¿hewed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flood brought in vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
Example of his mercie, in Å¿auing Noe
and his familie: Å¿o that his iuÅ¿tice and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
goeth alwaies together, as Dauid Å¿aith,
<hi>I will Å¿ing of mercie and iudgement, PÅ¿al.</hi>
101. repreÅ¿enting the perÅ¿on of ChriÅ¿t,
which Å¿hould be in his kingdom, as wel iuÅ¿t
as mercifull: a Lion of the tribe of Iuda, to
teare in pieces the wicked, and a Lambe to
preÅ¿erue his with al gentleneÅ¿Å¿e &amp; Å¿oftneÅ¿Å¿e.
Looke vpon Sodome, how the Lord Å¿hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there his extreme and Å¿euere IuÅ¿tice vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
thoÅ¿e miÅ¿creants, to conÅ¿ume them with fire
and brimÅ¿tone from heauen moÅ¿t terribly,
<hi>Gen. 19. and</hi> as Peter Å¿ayeth, <hi>Made them
an example for all ages and poÅ¿terities to
come, of his iuÅ¿tice againÅ¿t Å¿inne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes,
2. Pet.</hi> 2. But yet then hee deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
iuÅ¿t Lot out of tentation and trouble.
Note his mercy in it, to the good &amp; godly.
I might heere recken vp the examples of
Sennacherib, of Achab, of Nabuchodono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor,
of Herode, of Iulian, and Å¿uch other
perÅ¿ecuting kings and Emperours againÅ¿t
the Church of ChriÅ¿t: whome all God in
his iuÅ¿tice hath ouerthrowen and vtterly
deÅ¿troyed. This we learne, that God doeth
alÅ¿o preÅ¿erue the Å¿tate of mankinde by his
<pb facs="tcp:10917:18"/>
iuÅ¿tice, that one doeth not ouerrunne ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as wilde beaÅ¿tes. Then by this wee
learne to Å¿tand in feare of Gods iuÅ¿tice, if
we Å¿inne at any tyme deÅ¿perately, leaÅ¿t we
be caught vp with it, and Å¿uddenly conÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<hi>If his wrath be kindled, yea but a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
bleÅ¿Å¿ed are al they that put their truÅ¿t
in him, PÅ¿alme 2. For our God in his
wrath and iuÅ¿tice is a conÅ¿uming fire,</hi> as
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. And it is an horrible thing, to
fall into his handes. If he be angry, who
may abide or Å¿tande in his Å¿ight, when the
hilles melte away, and the Å¿ea is dried vp,
and the hard rockes cleaue aÅ¿under? O that
we had this conÅ¿ideration of his iuÅ¿tice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes continually, it would keepe
vs from all Å¿inne and vngodlines: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we Å¿inne, becauÅ¿e wee feare not this
iuÅ¿tice of the Lordes. <hi>There is no feare
of god</hi> (Å¿ayeth Dauid of the wicked)
<hi>before their eyes,</hi> therefore they Å¿inne.
We Å¿ee then what wee haue to note vpon
this article of our ChriÅ¿tian beliefe, and
what commodity commeth vnto vs of the
creation of all thinges by God, howe we
gather and conÅ¿ider of his infinite great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e,
by his wonderfull woorkes: for
the heauens declare the glory of God,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:19"/>
and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firmament Å¿heweth his handy worke.
And this is one way to come to God, as to
be without excuÅ¿e before his tribunall Å¿eate
in the day of iudgement, when the Å¿ecretes
of all heartes Å¿hall be diÅ¿cloÅ¿ed, and all
thoughts opened before the Lorde. By this
creation the heathen men are without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿e,
and haue knowen him generally, as
Paul Å¿ayeth, Romanes the firÅ¿t chap. That
which may be knowen of God, is manifeÅ¿t
in them, for God hath Å¿hewed it vnto them.
For the inuiÅ¿ible things of him, that is, his
eternall power and Godhead, are Å¿eene by
the creation of the worlde, being conÅ¿idered
in his workes, to the intent, that they Å¿hould
be without excuÅ¿e, becauÅ¿e that when they
knew God, they glorified him not as God,
neyther were thankefull, but became vayne
in their imaginations, &amp; their fooliÅ¿h heart
was full of darkneÅ¿Å¿e: when they profeÅ¿Å¿ed
themÅ¿elues to be wiÅ¿e, they became fooles.
God is knowen three wayes, by his works,<note place="margin">God is kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen three wayes.</note>
by his worde, and by his holy Å¿pirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Although God be knowen by all theÅ¿e
wayes of his elect, yet he is knowen of the
reprobate onely by his worde and workes,
which Å¿ee the workes, and heare his worde,
but neuer haue his Spirite directing them
<pb facs="tcp:10917:19"/>
aright, which is proper onely to his owne
children. Of the firÅ¿t way Å¿peaketh Paul in
this place, vnto the which the creation is a
glaÅ¿Å¿e, to bring vs to a full conÅ¿ideration of
his greatneÅ¿Å¿e. Wel, we learne by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of heauen and earth, his power, his
wiÅ¿edome, his goodneÅ¿Å¿e and iuÅ¿tice, and
whatÅ¿oeuer elÅ¿e may be in God. This is
great comfort to the godly, and bringeth
great boldeneÅ¿Å¿e vnto them, and truÅ¿t in the
laÅ¿t day, that they haue Å¿uch a father, and do
beleeue in Å¿uch a God, as is maker of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and earth: this teacheth vs our duetie, to
referre all our actions to his honour and
glory, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>feÅ¿Å¿e him alone, to acknowledge
that he made vs, and not we our lelues, to
liue to him, to dye to him, to do al things for
his Å¿ake, that hath made all for vs, as good
Å¿eruantes Å¿hould be more carefull of their
maÅ¿ters honour &amp; profite, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of their own.
Nowe let vs giue thankes to Å¿uch a God,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath vouchÅ¿afed to giue vs faith to beleeue

hee hath Å¿hewed his wiÅ¿edome, power,

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue Å¿eene in the firÅ¿t article
going before, the thinges, which
we haue to beleeue as concerning
God the father in his creation:
now followeth conÅ¿equently what we haue
to beleeue of God the Å¿onne, IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,
as concerning his incarnation and all the
benefites of his death and paÅ¿Å¿ion, which is
the Å¿econd part of the creede, as we deuided
it. And here in this article you muÅ¿t vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tande
and repeate, as in the former, Å¿o in
this alÅ¿o: <hi>I beleeue in IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t:</hi> that is,
I truÅ¿t in him, and put my whole confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in him, that hee is my onely Å¿auiour,
and that God will for his Å¿ake forgiue
me all my Å¿innes. For it is not Å¿ufficient to
beleeue in God the father, &amp; to know him,
vnleÅ¿Å¿e we alÅ¿o beleeue in his only begotten
Å¿onne IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿te our Lorde, and knowe
him alÅ¿o. As Iohn repeating the wordes of
<pb facs="tcp:10917:21"/>
our Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t, Å¿aith, <hi>This is life eternal
that they know thee to be the onely very
God, &amp; whom thou haÅ¿t Å¿ent, IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.
Ioh.</hi> 17. So that our Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t ioyneth
and matcheth in one, the knowledge of him
Å¿elfe with the knowledge of the father, as he
Å¿ayeth alÅ¿o in another place, <hi>Except ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that I am he, ye Å¿hal die in your Å¿ins.</hi>
We Å¿ee then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if we muÅ¿t beleeue in IeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t, he is one God with the father, and a
creator, other wiÅ¿e it were idolatry to beleue
in any that is not God. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
in him, this is warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ted vnto vs by his
owne commandement, Å¿aying in the 19. of
Iohns goÅ¿pel to his diÅ¿ciples, <hi>Let not your
heart be troubled, beleeue ye in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
alÅ¿o in me.</hi> A notable place to prooue
this matter. Where we may alÅ¿o learne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
if we beleeue in God, our hearts Å¿hal not be
troubled, nor wauer hither &amp; thither, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
any place to reÅ¿t in. For therfore in our
miÅ¿eries &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>gers are we vexed &amp; troubled
out of meaÅ¿ure, becauÅ¿e we put not our full
truÅ¿t in the father &amp; the Å¿onne. Nowe let vs
Å¿ee with what titles our ChriÅ¿t is beautified
&amp; adorned with, for our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fort &amp; conÅ¿olati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
firÅ¿t of all, he is here called IeÅ¿us, which
is an Ebrew word, &amp; Å¿ou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>deth in EngliÅ¿h as
<pb facs="tcp:10917:21"/>
much as Sauiour, which name the Angell
gaue vnto him (by Gods appoyntment) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was conceaued in the wombe of the
virgin Mary his mother. As we reade no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
Å¿et forth vnto vs in the firÅ¿t of Matth:
Shee Å¿hal bring foorth a Å¿onne, and cal his
name IeÅ¿us, or Å¿auiour: for he Å¿hall Å¿aue
his people from their Å¿innes and offences.
And for this cauÅ¿e he came into the worlde,
as he teÅ¿tifieth of him Å¿elf: The Å¿onne of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
came to Å¿aue that which is loÅ¿t, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troy
Å¿oules, but to Å¿aue, and to giue his life
a redemption for many, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. By this we
learne, that there is no other Sauiour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
for ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, either in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, or earth, but
only IeÅ¿us: and they that wil haue Å¿aluation
of God the father, muÅ¿t haue it onely at his
handes. Therefore doeth the Å¿cripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
of him, that there is no other name
giuen vnder heauen vnto men, wherein they
muÅ¿t be Å¿aued, but only in the name of <hi>IeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t.</hi> For this is the Å¿tone which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the head Å¿tone, and the chiefe in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
neither is there any Å¿aluation in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Act.</hi> 4. We haue then to Å¿eek our Å¿alua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not in Angels, not in Å¿aints, not in men
or in our Å¿elues: but in him onely that hath
the key of Dauid, that Å¿hutteth heauen, and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:22"/>
no man openeth it, and openeth it, &amp; no man
Å¿hutteth. This is the firÅ¿t title of dignitie
and honour, that is giuen vnto him of his
father: the next is, that hee is called ChriÅ¿t,
which is a Greeke word, and Å¿ignifieth in
EngliÅ¿h, Anoynted, which doth more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; effectually declare his office &amp; function
giuen him of the father for vs. For he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted
for three eÅ¿peciall purpoÅ¿es: firÅ¿t to
bee our Prophet to teach vs, Å¿econdly, our
prieÅ¿t to offer him Å¿elfe a Å¿acrifice for vs, and
thirdly, our king to rule &amp; to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d vs from
our enemies. TheÅ¿e things are al giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vnto
vs to vnderÅ¿tande in this name ChriÅ¿t. For
as al the Prophets, and prieÅ¿tes and kinges
in the time of the olde law, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of ChriÅ¿t, were anoynted with oyle by
the commandement of God, as God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Elias</hi> to anoynt <hi>EliÅ¿eus</hi> Prophet in his
Å¿tead, &amp; MoÅ¿es was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maunded to anoynt
Aaron hye prieÅ¿t, and Samuel to anoynt
Saul &amp; Dauid to be kinges: Å¿o was ChriÅ¿t
alÅ¿o anoynted, not with oyle materiall as
they, but with Å¿piritual oyle of gladneÅ¿Å¿e, as
Dauid Å¿aieth,<note place="margin">PÅ¿al. 45. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>aboue his fellowes,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, with
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoÅ¿t, aboue al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, for he had it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
meaÅ¿ure, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 34. So then, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
&amp; prieÅ¿ts, &amp; kings were all figures, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:10917:22"/>
Å¿hadowes of ChriÅ¿t anoynted with oyle, to
Å¿ignifie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they muÅ¿t be gentle, meeke, &amp; Å¿oft
to al their brethren: Å¿o it was alÅ¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould performe al this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
by him. And firÅ¿t we Å¿ee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ChriÅ¿t toke
vpon him the office of a Prophet, to teach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
people his fathers wil, not thruÅ¿ting in him
Å¿elfe as the falÅ¿e prophetes did, whom the
Lord Å¿ent not at al, but being thereto lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
called &amp; authoriÅ¿ed by his father from
heauen,<note place="margin">Luk 9. 35.</note> Å¿aying, <hi>Heare him,</hi> that is, to be our
doctour and teacher, our Prophete and
ScholemaÅ¿ter. Being thus ordayned a
Prophet to teach vs, he executed his office
and calling moÅ¿t diligently, moÅ¿t paynfully
and faithfully: for he taught them in Å¿eaÅ¿on
and out of Å¿eaÅ¿on, earely and late, at home &amp;
abroad, by Å¿ea and by land, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> EuangeliÅ¿ts
doe Å¿ufficiently all of them record in their
goÅ¿pels, neither did he teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil of his
father publikely in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿ynagogues only, but
priuately alÅ¿o in families &amp; houÅ¿es: as when
he was receiued into Marthas houÅ¿e, he Å¿ate
&amp; taught there Mary &amp; others: whereby wee
that are the Lordes Prophets &amp; miniÅ¿ters,
may learne by this good exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ple, howe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
&amp; readyly with al payne and diligence
to behaue our Å¿elues in the preaching of the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:23"/>
word of God his GoÅ¿pell, not to ceaÅ¿e at
any time, but to doe as he hath done before
vs. If then ChriÅ¿t be our Prophet (as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es
Å¿ayth of him, A Prophet Å¿hall the Lord
your God rayÅ¿e vp vnto you of your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
like vnto me: him Å¿hal you heare in al
thinges, that he Å¿hal Å¿peake vnto you, <hi>Deut.</hi>
18.) we muÅ¿t heare him alone, &amp; not others
that teach falÅ¿e doctrine, as the papiÅ¿ts: for
ChriÅ¿ts Å¿heepe heare his voyce, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. We
learne againe, that no man beÅ¿ide ChriÅ¿te,
was able to inÅ¿truct vs in the will of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but hee alone, as Iohn Å¿ayth, Chap. 1.
<hi>No man hath Å¿eene God at any time: the
only begotten Å¿on of God, which is in the
boÅ¿ome of his father, he hath reuealed him
vnto vs.</hi> Againe, we vnderÅ¿tand that al men
by nature are ignorant of the will of God, &amp;
their dutie, becauÅ¿e we haue neede of ChriÅ¿t
to informe vs in the right way, to leade vs
in the trueth, leaÅ¿t we be deceued with lyes.
<hi>For of his fulneÅ¿Å¿e haue wee all receiued,
Ioh.</hi> 1. Therefore is he called of EÅ¿ay, The
angel of great CounÅ¿ell, and that the Å¿pirit
of the Lord Å¿hould reÅ¿t vpon him, the Å¿pirit
of wiÅ¿edome &amp; vnderÅ¿tanding, the Å¿pirit of
CounÅ¿el and Å¿trength, the Å¿pirit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and of the feare of the Lord, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 11.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:23"/>
This is a great comfort to vs, to haue Å¿uch
a teacher and Prophet giuen to vs, as is
made to vs of God, wiÅ¿edome. 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 1.
But the wicked can haue here no part at all
with him, for they do not heare his word and
voyce, neither wil they receiue his doctrine
&amp; inÅ¿truction. Nowe we Å¿ee how faithfully
ChriÅ¿t hath fulfilled this office of preaching,
as Marke Å¿ayth of him, 1. Chap. Let vs goe
into the next Townes, that I may preache
there alÅ¿o, for I came out for that purpoÅ¿e.
The ende of this prophecie and teaching is,
that we Å¿houlde bee made his diÅ¿ciples and
Å¿chollers,<note place="margin">ChriÅ¿ts prieÅ¿t hoode.</note> which God graunt vnto vs all. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
The Å¿econd office that is in ChriÅ¿t for
his Church, is his prieÅ¿thode: for after hee
had taught the people, (which thing he firÅ¿t
tooke in hand) hee Å¿ealed his doctrine with
his owne blood, and offered vp him Å¿elfe
a Å¿acrifice moÅ¿t perfect, Å¿weete and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God his father, for vs al, to purge
vs from our Å¿innes, to Å¿erue the liuing God.
For this alÅ¿o was the duetie of the prieÅ¿ts in
the Leuitical lawe, that they Å¿hould offer Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
for the Å¿innes of the people, &amp; pray
to God for them. This hath ChriÅ¿t fulfilled
by his death &amp; paÅ¿Å¿ion, which was Å¿o effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
&amp; meritorious to take away Å¿innes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:24"/>
father Å¿aith of him,<note place="margin">PÅ¿al. 110. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou art a PrieÅ¿t for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
after the order of MelchieÅ¿edech.</hi> Of
this Å¿acrifice Å¿peaketh abundantly the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tle
to the Hebremes, but eÅ¿pecially in the
9. Chap.<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> Å¿aying, <hi>That ChriÅ¿t was once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to take away the Å¿innes of many, and
to put away Å¿inne by the Å¿acrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe.</hi>
And againe, that the blood of ChriÅ¿t,
which through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eternal Å¿pirit offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe
without fault to God, Å¿hall purge our
conÅ¿ciences from dead workes to Å¿erue the
liuing God, Å¿o that nowe he is become our
mediatour betweene God &amp; vs, &amp; doeth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the Å¿ight of God for vs. This is a
great comfort for vs. But we Å¿ee in this Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
the vileneÅ¿Å¿e &amp; greatneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿inne, &amp;
how lothÅ¿ome &amp; deteÅ¿table it was in Gods
Å¿ight, that nothing in heauen or earth could
put it away or purge it, but the onely body
&amp; blood of ChriÅ¿t, this hie prieÅ¿t, moÅ¿t pure
and immaculate. This doth teach vs to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
Å¿inne, Å¿eeing ChriÅ¿t payed Å¿o dearely
for it. And this driueth vs to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿ider how we
are indebted to our good Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t, for
dying Å¿o mercifully for vs: Å¿o that wee are
worÅ¿e then beaÅ¿ts, vnleÅ¿Å¿e we giue him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
thanks for it. Nothing could pacifie
Gods wrath conceiued againÅ¿t our Å¿innes,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:24"/>
but only his deare Å¿onne, <hi>for in him he was
wel pleaÅ¿ed, Matth.</hi> 3. So that nowe wee
which were Å¿ometime farre off &amp; Å¿trangers
from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon wealth of IÅ¿rael, are made
neere by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blod of ChriÅ¿t, to offer our Å¿elues
to him &amp; al ours, our prayers, our thanks, &amp;
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with boldneÅ¿Å¿e, without feare, as Zachary
Å¿ayth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. The third office y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we conÅ¿ider
in him, is his Å¿pirituall &amp; euerlaÅ¿ting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for Å¿piritual it is, &amp; not carnal &amp; earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as he himÅ¿elf Å¿aid to Pilate, <hi>My kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angel Å¿ayde to Mary, <hi>He Å¿hal reigne
ouer the houÅ¿e of Iacob, &amp; of his kingdom
there Å¿hal be no end.</hi> So then he is a king,
as Zachary alÅ¿o Å¿ayth, <hi>Behold, thy king co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vnto thee, meeke, O daughter Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem,</hi>
Chap. 9. This kingdom, he laÅ¿t of al
tooke vpon him, after that he had taught, and
offered vp him Å¿elfe, euen then when hee aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
to Å¿it at the right hand of God: that
is, to haue all power and authority in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and earth. This kingdome doeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿t
chiefly in gouerning his electe, and his
Church by his holy Å¿pirite: for hee hath
gotten this kingdome for vs, becauÅ¿e hee
armeth vs with power to reÅ¿iÅ¿t Å¿inne, and
giueth vs of his princely treaÅ¿ures &amp; gifts,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:25"/>
and wil at the laÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe lift vs vp thither,
and Å¿et vs with him in glory and honour, to
raine for euer &amp; euer, as he Å¿aith, It is your
fathers wil to giue you a kingdome, and he
that ouercommeth, Å¿hall Å¿it with mee in my
kingdome, as I haue ouercome, &amp; Å¿it with
my father in his kingdom. Reue. 3. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this kingdom of ChriÅ¿t doth beat downe
al force rayÅ¿ed vp againÅ¿t his kingdome: as
the deuil, the Turke, the Pope, the wicked
ones of this world. Here he Å¿heweth himÅ¿elf
a mighty king ouer al the earth, to preÅ¿erue
his Church, hauing Å¿o many enemies. For
Å¿urely if he did not preÅ¿erue it, it would bee
Å¿wallowed vp euery houre, Å¿atan is Å¿o gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to deÅ¿troy it. What they haue don againÅ¿t
it, we Å¿ee, but they could neuer preuaile: for
this is a comfortable Å¿aying,<note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> The gates of
hell Å¿hall not preuaile againÅ¿t it. Of this we
gather y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall euer haue his Church,
becauÅ¿e his power in his kingdom is infinit
to keep it: let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked rage neuer Å¿o much,
yet ChriÅ¿t is king of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole earth, yea the
world. Thus much for his kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,
<hi>his only Å¿onne.</hi> Here is declared vnto
vs, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is the only Å¿onne of God,
&amp; therfore God, becauÅ¿e y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿onne is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿ame
nature w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father: for he is one w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his father.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:25"/>
This is the third title giuen to our Å¿auiour
ChriÅ¿t, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Å¿onne of God:
but there may a queÅ¿tion bee inade, How is
ChriÅ¿t the only Å¿onne of God, Å¿eeing we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o
are Å¿o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>nes as he is, as Iohn Å¿aith, <hi>As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as beleeue in ChriÅ¿t, he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> power
to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>nes of God?</hi> To this we anÅ¿were,
that ChriÅ¿t is the only Å¿onne of God by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
&amp; Å¿ubÅ¿tance: and we by grace &amp; adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which before were not. For as when a

owne: Å¿o it is with God and vs. He hath no
moe Å¿onnes but one onely by nature &amp; Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance:
but by his loue and grace he maketh
vs his deare children by adoption in ChriÅ¿t:
for all is done for ChriÅ¿tes Å¿ake our elder
brother, as Paul proueth, <hi>Ephe. 1. He hath
predeÅ¿tinated vs to be adopted for Å¿onnes
in IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</hi> For this then, that we are
Å¿onnes to Å¿o high &amp; great a God, a Lord and
king, ought we not to be very thankeful?
ought we not by all meanes to Å¿et forth his
honor &amp; glory more then our own? Surely
we Å¿hould do Å¿o: for how would I loue that
king here in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, or that Queene, or that

Now much more ought I to loue the Å¿onne
of God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath made me Å¿onne to his father
by his death &amp; Å¿atiÅ¿faction. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> ChriÅ¿t
is called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only begotten Å¿onne of God, we
muÅ¿t not imagine a carnall or groÅ¿Å¿e beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

and againe, <hi>Ye are not your own: for ye are
bought with a price, 1. Cor.</hi> 6. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is he made lord and king of his father o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
all the world, that al Å¿hould worÅ¿hip and
honour the Å¿onne, as they honour the father
him Å¿elfe: for he is not only the head of men,
but of all the Angels in heauen, as it is Å¿aid,
<hi>Let all the Angels of God worÅ¿hip him,
Heb. 1. Ephe.</hi> 1. Thus ye Å¿ee how ChriÅ¿t is
appoynted Lorde and heyre of all thinges:
<pb facs="tcp:10917:26"/>
therefore is he called here our Lord, and we
then confeÅ¿Å¿e our Å¿elues to be his Å¿eruantes
and Å¿ubiectes, to do his wil and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.
He is called alÅ¿o our Lord, becauÅ¿e
we Å¿hould conceaue comfort by it in trouble,
that he will be a moÅ¿t gratious lord vnto vs
alÅ¿o, as wel as vnto others: as Thomas Å¿aid
of him, Å¿o muÅ¿t we Å¿ay and bee perÅ¿waded,
<hi>My God and my Lord. Iohn 21.
Which was conceiued by the holy GhoÅ¿t.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nowe foloweth his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy
ghoÅ¿t &amp; not by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿eed of man: for if he had bin
conceiued by man, he had not bene voyde of
Å¿inne, as Ioh chap. 3. ver. 6. Iob. 6. chap. 25.
verÅ¿e. 5, 6. and Å¿o Å¿houlde he haue bene vnfit
to deliuer vs from Å¿inne. Therefore our Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Å¿aith, <hi>For them I do Å¿anctifie my Å¿elf.
And Å¿uch an high PrieÅ¿t it became vs to
haue, which is holy, harmeles, vndefiled, Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated
from Å¿inners, and made hier then
the heauens.</hi> As that which went before, did
proue vnto vs Å¿ufficiently his diuinitie and
godhead, that he was yeÅ¿terday, to day &amp; for
euer, as is proued in the EpiÅ¿tle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
cha. 13. Å¿o this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ception in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wombe
of the virgin doth proue, that he is very and
true man, &amp; had a beginning according to
his humanitie, as the Å¿criptures doe witnes
<pb facs="tcp:10917:27"/>
vnto vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>he was made of the Å¿eede of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
according to the fleÅ¿h. Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.</hi> 1. And, <hi>that
God Å¿e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t his Å¿o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ne into the world, made of a
woman, Gal.</hi> 4. The maner of this concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is deÅ¿cribed liuely vnto vs by S. Luk.
Cha. 1. For after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Angel had told Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that Å¿he Å¿hould conceiue in her wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>be, and
bring forth a Å¿onne, and cal his name IeÅ¿us,
Å¿he aÅ¿ked howe it Å¿hould come to paÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Å¿he knew no man: then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angel telleth
her, that the holy ghoÅ¿t Å¿hould come vpon
her, &amp; the power of y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> moÅ¿t high Å¿hould ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hadow
her: therefore that holy thing which
Å¿halbe borne of thee, Å¿hal be called the Å¿onne
of God. So likwiÅ¿e in Matth. 1. we reade,
that when IoÅ¿eph her huÅ¿band would haue
put her away priuily, thinking Å¿he had bene
with child of Å¿ome ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>: the Angel called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him being thus minded, in a dreame, Å¿ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
IoÅ¿eph, thou Å¿onne of Dauid, feare not
to take Mary for thy wife: for that which is
conceiued in her, is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoÅ¿t. We Å¿ee
then that al fleÅ¿h in Adam had corrupted his
way before the Lord, &amp; that the ordinary ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> was vncleane, therfore it was
neceÅ¿Å¿ary that ChriÅ¿t that Å¿hould redeeme
others from Å¿inne, Å¿hould not be Å¿ubiect to it
himÅ¿elf, but bee borne by an extraordinarie
<pb facs="tcp:10917:27"/>
meane, to cleanÅ¿e vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> all our Å¿innes, both
original &amp; actual, which he was voyde of by
reaÅ¿o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>: wherfore ChriÅ¿t muÅ¿t
be both ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> &amp; God to redeeme vs: Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> had offended, &amp; our Å¿innes had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vs, as a cloude doth the bright
Å¿unne from our eies: &amp; he muÅ¿t be God alÅ¿o,
to make reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to God his father for
vs: for no Angel in heauen was able to do
this office of mediation, but the only God &amp;
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true mediator, for al our
Å¿innes paÅ¿t, preÅ¿ent, or to come. Here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿ider
the great loue of ChriÅ¿t toward mankinde,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> deÅ¿piÅ¿ed not our fleÅ¿h, to take it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> him,
beeing God equall to his father, and hath
inueÅ¿ted and couered himÅ¿elfe with our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but yet without Å¿inne. This doth teach
vs our duety towards him in tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>kfulnes, &amp;
our duty towards our neighbors in yelding
vnto them in matters for their behalf, &amp; not
to pleaÅ¿e our Å¿elues, but to beare with them,
&amp; debaÅ¿e our Å¿elues for them, as ChriÅ¿t hath
done for vs already. <hi>Phil. 2. Let the Å¿ame
minde be in you, which was in ChriÅ¿t Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us.</hi>
We learne by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of ChriÅ¿t by
the holy ghoÅ¿t, that he was thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ceiued, to
make our Å¿infull conception pure: For we
are conceiued and borne in Å¿innes euery one
<pb facs="tcp:10917:28"/>
of vs, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the beÅ¿t of vs al, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> come of Adam.
Dauid lamenteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> impurity &amp; imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his conception and birth, Å¿aying, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
Lorde, I was borne in iniquitie, &amp; in
Å¿inne hath my mother conceiued me, PÅ¿al.</hi>
51. as if he would Å¿ay, The cauÅ¿e of this my
outward Å¿inne &amp; actual, as murder &amp; adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
is, that I was conceiued in Å¿inne, and can
doe nothing els of my Å¿elfe but Å¿inne euery
houre: as Paul alÅ¿o co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>plaineth of himÅ¿elfe,
<hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. 7. O wretched ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that I am, who Å¿hal
deliuer me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the bodie of this death?</hi> and
then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>meth vnto ChriÅ¿t, &amp; thanketh him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
he hath deliuered him from it. We haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fort our Å¿elues in this, that ChriÅ¿t was
conceiued for vs, borne for vs, &amp; died for vs,
&amp; whatÅ¿oeuer he did, he did it for our profite
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>modity. In that that ChriÅ¿t was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
we alÅ¿o vnderÅ¿tand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verity of Gods
promiÅ¿es made vnto vs in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophtes, which
had lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g before prophecied of it: As in <hi>EÅ¿ai. 7.
Behold,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>A virgin Å¿hall conceiue &amp;
beare a Å¿onne, and Å¿he Å¿hall call his name
Immanuel.</hi> So we gather, that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
perfourmed this, he is alwayes iuÅ¿t &amp;
true in his promiÅ¿es y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he maketh to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d
generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s. And furthermore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
Å¿pake not by their own wil,</hi> (as Peter
Å¿aith) <hi>but by the wil &amp; Å¿pirit of God, euen
<pb facs="tcp:10917:28"/>
as they were led &amp; moued by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoÅ¿t,
2. Pet.</hi> 1. So y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whatÅ¿oeuer God ether Å¿pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
or promiÅ¿eth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good &amp; godly to their
comfort, it Å¿hal come to paÅ¿Å¿e: as here in EÅ¿ai
God promiÅ¿eth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of ChriÅ¿t for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

to HieruÅ¿ale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> beÅ¿ieged w<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t her enemies,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Achaz was king, EÅ¿a. 7. LikewiÅ¿e on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
contrary part, whatÅ¿oeuer the Lord of hoÅ¿ts
threatneth to the wicked &amp; deÅ¿troyers of his
Church, Å¿hal alÅ¿o in due time be fulfilled and
acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pliÅ¿hed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vttermoÅ¿t, as vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes
for murdering of ChriÅ¿t,<note place="margin">Luke 19.</note> &amp; vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romane
Emperours, for going about to ouerthrow
his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> &amp; flock. Although it be many
times long before the Lord doth either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly, or puniÅ¿h y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reprobate, yet it is
moÅ¿t Å¿ure &amp; certaine, becauÅ¿e his mouth hath

Å¿aith of him, <hi>Hath he Å¿poken, &amp; Å¿hal he not
performe it, &amp; Å¿aid it, &amp; Å¿hal he not make it
good?</hi> That were vnpoÅ¿Å¿ible. When we
Å¿ay that ChriÅ¿t was conceiued in the wombe
of the virgin Marie his mother, by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and worke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoÅ¿t, we meane
that to bee Å¿poken according to his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
only, and not according to his diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
for Å¿o hee is likened to MelchiÅ¿edech,
without father as touching his fleÅ¿h, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:10917:29"/>
mother as concerning his godhead, and
yet we Å¿ay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ChriÅ¿t was conceiued, becauÅ¿e
ChriÅ¿t both God &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, was ioined together
in one perÅ¿on. Therfore we muÅ¿t wiÅ¿ely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinguÅ¿h
&amp; make a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce betweene y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> two

not the day of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ChriÅ¿t, as he is the Å¿onne of God, and God
himÅ¿elfe, that made al things, as Iohn Å¿aith
of him, <hi>By him al things were made.</hi> If we
marke &amp; obÅ¿erue theÅ¿e two points, the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of ChriÅ¿t, &amp; his humanity, we Å¿hal finde
great light and eaÅ¿ines in reading the newe

IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. FirÅ¿t, that he was conceiued,
as the word doth teÅ¿tifie. Secondly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was conceiued: which was, becauÅ¿e
he might become very man to redeeme and
Å¿uffer for man, offending the maieÅ¿tie of the

that we may liue here in righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

Å¿ort of men, but of a maide or virgin,

IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t was conceyued by the holy
GhoÅ¿t, Å¿o was he borne likewiÅ¿e for mee of

Å¿till a virgin. Out of the which

and poyntes for our inÅ¿truction and

of the Å¿ame, thirdly, the profit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
that we may reape by it, beleeuing
it truely as we ought to doe.</p>
                  <p>1 As concerning his birth, EÅ¿ai in his
Å¿euenth and ninth Chapter Å¿aith, <hi>The Lord
him Å¿elfe Å¿hall giue you a Å¿igne. Beholde,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:30"/>
a virgin Å¿hall conceiue and beare a Sonne,
and Å¿he Å¿hall call his name Immanuel:
butter and honie Å¿hall he eate, till he haue
knowelege to refuÅ¿e the euil, and to chuÅ¿e
the good.</hi> LikewiÅ¿e the ninth Chapter:
<hi>Vnto vs a childe is borne, and vnto vs a
Å¿onne is giuen, and the gouernment is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Å¿houlder, and he Å¿hal call his name,
Wonderful, Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿eller, The mightie God,

and with iuÅ¿tice, from henceforth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

EÅ¿ai long before propheÅ¿ied of this
birth, to the comfort of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people in his time.
The like thing doeth Ieremie alÅ¿o declare
vnto vs in his propheÅ¿ie, of this wonderful
natiuitie of our Sauiour IeÅ¿us, Å¿aying in
his Chap. 23. <hi>Behold, the daies come, Å¿aith
the Lord, that I will raiÅ¿e vp vnto Dauid a
righteous branch, &amp; a king Å¿hal reigne &amp;
proÅ¿per, &amp; Å¿hal execute true iudgement &amp;
iuÅ¿tice vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the earth. In his daies Iuda Å¿hal
be Å¿aued, and IÅ¿rael Å¿hall dwell Å¿afely: and</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10917:31"/>
fulneÅ¿Å¿e <hi>of time,</hi> as the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿peaketh,
<hi>was come, then God Å¿ent his Sonne made
of a woman, and made vnder the Lawe,
that he might redeeme them which were
vnder the Law, that we might receiue the
adoption of Å¿onnes, Gal. 4. God then, as in
this, Å¿o in all other things, is true and iuÅ¿t of
his promiÅ¿e and couenant, that he maketh
to a thouÅ¿and generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s,</hi> as Å¿aith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.
For nothing can let him, to bring his
words to paÅ¿Å¿e, his power is infinit &amp; ouer
all. And although it be Å¿aid that Marie was
maried to IoÅ¿eph, &amp; IoÅ¿eph tooke her home
to him to be his wife, yet Å¿he was a virgin,
for IoÅ¿eph knewe her not: Å¿o y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ChriÅ¿t was
borne of her being a virgin, &amp; IoÅ¿eph was
Å¿pouÅ¿ed to her in this reÅ¿pect, that he Å¿hould
be an aide and comfort for her in her trouble
and paine, in her flight into Egypt, &amp; in her
great pouertie: for Å¿he was Å¿o poore, that
Å¿he had no chamber to be deliuered in, but
laid our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t in a manger. For
theÅ¿e cauÅ¿es, was IoÅ¿eph called her huÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande
alÅ¿o, that Å¿hee myght be voyde of Å¿uÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
of fornication, and ChriÅ¿t not
thought to be borne out of wedlocke, or in
adulterie.</p>
                  <p>2 Secondly, for our inÅ¿truction let vs
<pb facs="tcp:10917:31"/>
conÅ¿ider the whole maner of ChriÅ¿ts birth,
after what Å¿ort and faÅ¿hion it was. S. Luke
doth declare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of it very liuely, &amp; Å¿aith,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> IoÅ¿eph &amp; Mary were at Bethlehem,
the dayes were accompliÅ¿hed that Å¿hee
Å¿houlde be deliuered, &amp; Å¿he brought forth
her firÅ¿t begotten Å¿onne, and wrapped him
in Å¿wadling clothes, and layde him in a
cratch or manger, becauÅ¿e there was no
roume for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in the Inne.</hi> By theÅ¿e words
we Å¿ee the maner of ChriÅ¿ts birth, howe it
was very poore and baÅ¿e in reÅ¿pect of the
world, &amp; nothing glorious in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eies of men,
or as myght beÅ¿eeme Å¿o great a prince as
he was. He that might haue bene borne in a
moÅ¿t magnificent and royall palace, would
be borne in a Å¿table or oxe Å¿tall, and he which
could haue bene layde in a moÅ¿t Å¿umptuous
bed of doune, with Å¿ilke &amp; veluet wrought &amp;
garniÅ¿hed, yet notwithÅ¿tanding woulde bee
layde in a vile manger. This doth paÅ¿Å¿e the
reach and capacitie of mans witte, and doth
expreÅ¿Å¿e vnto vs, how that <hi>the Lords waies
are not our wayes, nor his doinges as
ours are:</hi> For then Å¿urely woulde hee not
haue had ChriÅ¿t his Sonne to bee borne Å¿o
poorely, and without al honour and eÅ¿tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here in the earth. But here we Å¿ee the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:32"/>
great loue of ChriÅ¿t towardes vs, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woulde
Å¿o be borne for our Å¿akes. So that in this is
fulfilled that notable Å¿aying if S. Paul the
ApoÅ¿tle. 2. Corinth. 8. Chap. 9. Å¿aying, <hi>Ye
know the grace of our Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi>
he bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g rich, for your Å¿akes became poore,

vs. And not only was he borne Å¿o poore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; miÅ¿erably, but alÅ¿o liued Å¿o afterwarde
all his life time, while he was here vpon the
earth, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Å¿pace of 2. or 3. and thirty yeres,
inÅ¿omuch that when he was borne, he Å¿tedde
into Egypt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Herod y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Å¿ought to kil him,
no doubt with trouble &amp; paine. Afterward,
he liued with the beneuolence &amp; liberalitie
of certaine good wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, as of Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene,
&amp; Ioanna y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wife of Chuza Herods

holes, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> birds of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aire which haue their</hi>
neÅ¿ts, Mat. 8. By this we learne to take po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty
<pb facs="tcp:10917:32"/>
patiently, which the Lorde himÅ¿elfe
hath Å¿anctified in his owne body, neither
to thinke it accurÅ¿ed. And we learne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the contempt of this worlde, for ChriÅ¿t
had nothing glorious in the face and eyes
of man, hee was not riche, but poore. If
wee haue riches, let vs not thinke Å¿o
much, or highly of them, or be puffed vp
by them: for ChriÅ¿t had them not. If
wee be poore, let vs remember that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us
ChriÅ¿t was poore alÅ¿o in this life. It
is Å¿ufficient for vs, and enough, if we
may be riche after this life, not that theÅ¿e
riches and worldly thinges are ill, if
they be vÅ¿ed to Gods glory, but ChriÅ¿t
would teache vs by his example, that firÅ¿t
his kingdome is not of this world, &amp; then
not to be greeued if we lacke theÅ¿e tranÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye
thinges, for hee had them not at all:
wherefore if we haue meate and drinke and
raiment, we muÅ¿t be content. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances
of his birth, are the place of it, and
the tyme. As concerning the place, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe
and Luke both agree in one, that it
was Bethlehem, for Å¿o was it long before
prophecyed of by the Prophet Micheas.
Chap. 5. Å¿aying, <hi>And thou Bethlehem E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrathah,
art little to be among the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ands
<pb facs="tcp:10917:33"/>
of Iuda, yet our of thee Å¿hall come
foorth vnto me, one that Å¿halbe the ruler
in IÅ¿rael, whoÅ¿e goings foorth Å¿hall be
from the beginning and from euerlaÅ¿ting.</hi>
Where hee Å¿etteth foorth vnto vs plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
both the humanitie of ChriÅ¿t, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o
his diuinitie: his humanitie, in that
hee Å¿ayth, hee came out of Bethlehem:
and his diuinitie, in that his going foorth
was from euerlaÅ¿ting. The place then
was Bethlehem: no great and famous
citie as IeruÅ¿alem was, but a poore and
obÅ¿cure towne, nothing Å¿poken of among
men. Here wee may Å¿ee againe, that as
ChriÅ¿t Å¿hewed great humilitie in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his birth, Å¿o did hee alÅ¿o in chuÅ¿ing
Å¿o poore and vile a place as Bethlehem
was. And this was done no doubt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the wiÅ¿edome of the wiÅ¿e and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which woulde haue thought rather
that ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould haue bene borne at
IeruÅ¿alem, or Å¿ome Å¿uch like notable
and excellent citie. Well, our Å¿auiour
ChriÅ¿t choÅ¿e Bethlehem, and made it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
through his birth, and reiected all
other cities: Å¿o is fulfilled that Å¿aying of
Paul, <hi>God hath choÅ¿en the weake things
of the worlde, to confound the Å¿trong,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:33"/>
and vile things, and things that are deÅ¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed
hath God choÅ¿en, to bring to naught
the thinges that are, that no fleÅ¿he Å¿houlde
reioyce in his preÅ¿ence. 1. Corinthians</hi>
1. VerÅ¿es 27. 28, 29. Let no man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be grieued or aÅ¿hamed, if he be borne
in a poore and baÅ¿e village, for Å¿o was
ChriÅ¿t borne, and hee is nothing the
worÅ¿e for it: hee may come as Å¿oone to
heauen, as they that are borne in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t
cities. Neither let any man on the
contrarye, bragge and boaÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, if
hee were borne in a famous place: this
maketh him not the better, or neerer to
God. Wee may Å¿ee alÅ¿o at this day, where
ChriÅ¿t is moÅ¿t commonly to be founde:
not in great cities, and princes courts
Å¿o much, as in poore places, and obÅ¿cure
houÅ¿es. The wiÅ¿e men Å¿ought him at
IeruÅ¿alem the great citie, but ChriÅ¿t
was found in poore Bethlehem. Here
alÅ¿o learne, that the prophecies are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
Å¿till: for ChriÅ¿t, as they had Å¿ayed,
was borne in Bethlehem. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
beleeue the Prophets, either when
they comfort vs, or threaten vs for
Å¿innes, for they Å¿hall alwayes be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.
The time of our Sauiours
<pb facs="tcp:10917:34"/>
birth was in the dayes and raigne of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode
the king, as Saint Matthewe Å¿ayth,
Chapter. 2. and Å¿o had Iacob propheÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before, that ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould not be borne,
vntill the kingdome did ceaÅ¿e, and depart
from the race of the Iewes, and was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the nation of the Romanes, as <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿is.
49. The Å¿cepter Å¿hall not depart
from Iuda, nor a Lawegiuer from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
his feete, vntil Shiloh come, and
the people Å¿halbe gathered vnto him.</hi>
Meaning that ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould not be borne
and come among the Iewes, vntill Å¿uch
time as they had no kinges to rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them of their owne Å¿tocke, but of
Å¿trangers, as Herode was at that time.
ChriÅ¿t beeing borne in the tyme of king
Herode, a wicked king, and a Tyrant,
doeth Å¿hewe himÅ¿elfe moÅ¿t fauourable
to the Iewes his people, being in great
bondage and miÅ¿erye. For when They
had moÅ¿t neede of a Sauiour and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
not only of their bodyes, but eÅ¿pecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of their Å¿oules and conÅ¿ciences, religion
being corrupted among them, and his word
reiected, then I Å¿ay, ChriÅ¿t came, and was
borne a deliuerer vnto them. So is God
wont to deale in mercy toward his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:34"/>
then, and not before to Å¿ende helpe,
when they are at the laÅ¿t caÅ¿te, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be deuoured, to teache them, that
when there is no helpe and Å¿uccour
in them Å¿elues, then is there moÅ¿t pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent
ayde and comfort in him as hee Å¿ayde
to Paul, <hi>My power is made perfect, and
is Å¿trong in weakeneÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> that when wee
are moÅ¿t weake and feeble, then is God
moÅ¿t Å¿trong to deliuer vs from our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
He neuer deliuered the IÅ¿rae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
out of Egypt, vntill they were
brought to the extremytie, then hee Å¿ent
them MoÅ¿es, and Aaron, and not before:
for hee will humble man, and let him to
vnderÅ¿tand, that when hee doeth any thing
for him, and deliuer him, or beÅ¿towe any
gift vpon him in bodye or Å¿oule, it is
not for any thing that is in him, but
of his meere mercy and goodneÅ¿Å¿e, to
make his praiÅ¿e the more to be Å¿eene,
and men more thankefull vnto him.
Let his praiÅ¿e therefore be continually in
our mouthes, and let vs magnifie his
name together, as Å¿ayeth the Prophet
Dauid, <hi>PÅ¿alme.</hi> 103. ChriÅ¿t then viÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Iewes, when all thinges were
turned vpÅ¿ide downe, his Å¿eruice was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
<pb facs="tcp:10917:35"/>
by the traditions of men, as the
Scribes, and PhariÅ¿es, and Sadduces,
who had corrupted the puritye of Gods
worde and doctrine, and brought in their
owne pelfe and maners, were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnreformed, the poore neglected,
the Prophetes deÅ¿piÅ¿ed, and Gods laue
Å¿et at nought. So that when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
came amongÅ¿t them, hee reÅ¿pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not any thing hee Å¿awe in them, but
their extreeme miÅ¿erie and thraldome,
which moued him to pitye them, and
Å¿o much the more, becauÅ¿e they had
Å¿uch a cruell Tyrant to rayne ouer them,
as murdered a great many of their
young infantes. So the Lorde came
amongÅ¿t vs of late: when his GoÅ¿pell
was layed aÅ¿ide, and deuices of men, in
Å¿teade of it, were Å¿et vp, when his miniÅ¿ters
were in euery place perÅ¿ecuted, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
then he Å¿ent a deliuerer to purge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to reÅ¿tore his trueth againe, to
pull downe AntichriÅ¿t, and to aboliÅ¿h
Poperie: hee reÅ¿pected not any thing in
vs, for wee like Å¿heepe were all gone
aÅ¿tray, euery man turned his owne
way: but hee did this, being minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of his mercy and promes made
<pb facs="tcp:10917:35"/>
freely vnto vs in IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t: I pray
God wee may bee all truely thankefull,
for Å¿o great and wonderfull a benefite
beÅ¿towed vpon vs, as the like was neuer
Å¿eene in our lande before. Surely good
cauÅ¿e wee haue to remember the Lorde
in our beddes, that giueth vs in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿t
of our enemies, Å¿uch quietnes and reÅ¿t
from all perils and dangers. The thing
that followed immediately vpon this birth
of our Å¿auiour, was the comming of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
wiÅ¿e and famous men from the
EaÅ¿t to worÅ¿hippe him, being ledde with
an extraordinary Å¿tarre thereunto. Thus
God the Father woulde adorne and
magnifie the birth of his Å¿onne, with
the reÅ¿ort of theÅ¿e great and excellent
men. And herein no doubt they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gentiles, and the firÅ¿t fruites of them,
that came to our Sauiour, doe Å¿ignifye
that the Gentiles alÅ¿o aÅ¿wel as the Iewes,
Å¿houlde be called to be the people of
God, that there might be one folde and
one Å¿hephearde, as our Sauiour telleth
vs in the tenth Chaper of Iohns GoÅ¿pel.
This was comfortable for vs, being Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
men and Gentiles, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Å¿trangers from God, to be made
<pb facs="tcp:10917:36"/>
the peculiar people of God, and to be
tranÅ¿lated from the kingdome of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e,
into the euerlaÅ¿ting kingdome and
inheritance of his welbeloued Å¿onne. But
Å¿ee howe the declaration and Å¿hewing of
this birth of Å¿o wonderfull a king, by the
wiÅ¿emen, was taken of Herode and the
Iewes in HieruÅ¿alem: when they heard
the king of the Iewes to be borne, it is
Å¿ayde, that Herode and all IeruÅ¿alem
was troubled with him. Thus wee Å¿ee the
nature and condition of the wicked, that
when they Å¿houlde be glad, and reioyce in
the Lorde with thankeÅ¿giuing for his
benefites, then they are troubled, they
murmure, and are vnthankefull. Here
all IeruÅ¿alem had great occaÅ¿ion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
them to prayÅ¿e God, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider
not of it a whit, they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Å¿leepe in their dregges of Å¿inne.
May, Herode went about to kill him,
that came to dye for him, and to Å¿aue
him, if hee coulde haue beleeued it. This
doeth alÅ¿o reproue our maner and doings
at this day: for when wee Å¿hould yeeld
God prayÅ¿e and thankes, wee giue him
none, and when he is moÅ¿t ready to doe
vs good, either wee conÅ¿ider not of it,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:36"/>
or elÅ¿e vnthankfully refuÅ¿e it, as the Å¿wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿he
GergeÅ¿ites did. Howe hath ChriÅ¿t
viÅ¿ited vs in mercy, in giuing vs his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
GoÅ¿pel the foode of our Å¿oules, as much
as euer hee did to the Iewes? and yet I Å¿ay
wee are troubled Å¿till in our mindes and
Å¿oules, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cares of this world, which do
choke the Å¿eede of his holy word. Wel (dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beloued) let vs learne to be wiÅ¿e, and to
conÅ¿ider thankfully of Gods benefites in
time, leÅ¿t they be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> from vs, as they were
from the Iewes, and giuen to a nation that
Å¿hal better receiue them, and make greater
account of them. The third thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I Å¿aide
was to be conÅ¿idered in the birth of our Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, is the profite and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may take &amp; apply to our Å¿elues,
our Å¿oules and bodyes by it, and what due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is required of vs in this behalfe. The
commoditie that ariÅ¿eth to vs and al Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians
by his birth, is, that ChriÅ¿t came to
Å¿aue that which was loÅ¿t, as Paul doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
expreÅ¿Å¿e the ende of his comming in
the fleÅ¿he, Å¿aying, <hi>This is a true Å¿aying, and
by all meanes woorthy to bee receyued,
that IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t came into this worlde to
Å¿aue Å¿inners, 1. Timothie</hi> 1. 15. Then
we perceiue this, that ChriÅ¿t was borne to
<pb facs="tcp:10917:37"/>
redeeme vs. If he had not bene borne, wee
could not haue byn redeemed by him from
the power of hell, and of Satan. This is a
great matter, and a moÅ¿t excellent &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
benefite. For we vnderÅ¿tande now
plainly &amp; clerely by the word of the Lorde,
that the Å¿eede of the woman hath broken y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Å¿erpents head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. that there is a Lion
and a Lambe in diuers reÅ¿pectes, for his
Å¿trength a Lion, and a Lambe by his meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
found worthy to open the booke, &amp; to
looÅ¿e the Å¿euen Å¿eales of it, which no man
was able to doe, neither in heauen nor in
earth, nor vnder the earth, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 5. that
there is a <hi>childe,</hi> as <hi>EÅ¿aie</hi> Å¿ayth, <hi>giuen vnto
vs, vpon whoÅ¿e Å¿houlders the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t
of heauen and earth is laide, and doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿t.</hi>
We may Å¿aye therefore, that a man is
borne of the virgin Marie, the true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Å¿onne of Adam, of Abraham, of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
which was promiÅ¿ed in the lawe and
Prophets, Å¿uch a man I Å¿ay, that hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
hell and death, and damnation, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iuered
vs from the wrath of his father to
come. Of this, our faith may gather a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fruite and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>modite; the one, that there
is a mediatour betweene God &amp; man, euen
the man IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t: we haue this media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb facs="tcp:10917:37"/>
for vs in heauen already: the other, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by
the participation &amp; vnitie of his nature w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
ours, he receiueth &amp; admitteth vs into the
Å¿ocietie of him Å¿elfe, and all his riches and
treaÅ¿ures are made ours, euen as the wife
may Å¿ay of her huÅ¿band, that al her huÅ¿ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ds
goods &amp; lands are hers, becauÅ¿e Å¿he is one
with him: Å¿o may we Å¿ay of our moÅ¿t gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
huÅ¿band &amp; bridegrome IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,
that all his Å¿tore is now become ours: <hi>For
we are bones of his bones, and fleÅ¿h of his
fleÅ¿h,</hi> as Paul telleth vs plainly, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 5.
If this be Å¿o, <hi>then wee ought to reioyce
and be glad in our heartes,</hi> as Paul Å¿ayth,
<hi>which is, in the Lorde, becauÅ¿e that ChriÅ¿t
the great iewell of God is Å¿ent into the
worlde.</hi> If we greatly reioyce &amp; triumphe,
when wee haue a mortall Å¿onne an heyre
here borne in earth vnto vs, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> we knowe
not whether he Å¿hall be good or ill, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fort
or paine vnto vs: If (I Å¿ay) we do reioyce at
this vanity, what ought we to do (think ye)
dearly beloued brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> we heare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Å¿o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ne
of God to be borne for vs, &amp; the heire of all
things, a Å¿onne that pacifieth his fathers
wrath iuÅ¿tly conceiued againÅ¿t Å¿inne, Å¿uch a
childe as maketh vs children, &amp; bringeth vs
into his heauenly poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion &amp; inheritance?
<pb facs="tcp:10917:38"/>
Ought we not (trow you) vnÅ¿peakeably to
reioyce, &amp; thanke God and his Å¿onne ChriÅ¿t
continually? It is good reaÅ¿on Å¿o to do, Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is our onely benefit, and not his: for he
came and was borne for vs, and not for him
Å¿elfe. The angels of God herein may teach
vs our duety, howe thankfull we ought to
be, and to reioyce for it, not with a worldly
and carnal ioy, as many do, but with a Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and heauenly ioy of minde and conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as few doe. At the birth of our Å¿auiour,
there was a company and multitude of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Å¿ouldiers prayÅ¿ing God, and Å¿aying,
<hi>Glory be to God in the high heauens, and
peace in the earth, and towards men good
will, Luke</hi> 2. They reioyced in the Lord, &amp;
were thankful for it, &amp; yet are: much more
ought we to do the like, that his wil may be
done in earth of vs, as it is in heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t
them, euen as we dayly pray. <hi>Thy
wil be done in earth, as it is in heauen.</hi> We
haue in deede a celebration of this natiuitie
of ChriÅ¿t, which is miÅ¿called of vs ChriÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.
As y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name is euil, called ChriÅ¿tmas of
the PapiÅ¿ts, as if ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould Å¿ay MaÅ¿Å¿e: Å¿o
is the time in it Å¿pent as lewdly of vs for the
moÅ¿t part, if not in maÅ¿Å¿ing, yet in maÅ¿king,
in carding and dicing, in dauncing, in bellie
<pb facs="tcp:10917:38"/>
cheere, in exceÅ¿Å¿e of apparrell, and in fond
and fooliÅ¿he playes &amp; Å¿portes, to paÅ¿Å¿e the
time away. In theÅ¿e Å¿innes and vanities,
is the tyme of ChriÅ¿tes natiuitie Å¿pent and
conÅ¿umed of vs. It were better to haue no
day of it, then Å¿o to keepe it: and it is a great
griefe to a godly mynde, to Å¿ee that tyme
which Å¿houlde be imployed to the Å¿eruice of
God, as it was in the primitiue Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
waÅ¿ted and dedicated to offer Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
vnto the deuill: for it is in it, as it
is vpon the Sundayes or Lordes day tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout
the yeere. The Sabbath which is
appoynted for to heare Gods woorde, and
to pray in, is turned altogether to play in,
and made a day of all wicked Å¿port and paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
which is far from the ryght vÅ¿e of it, &amp;
yet no MagiÅ¿trate doeth correct it. God
giue an amendement one day of it, to his
honour and glory. Amen. Well, Å¿o it is
with this time of our Sauiours birth: we
Å¿houlde giue thankes in it, and wee neuer
thinke of our duetie in it the moÅ¿t part of
vs. If Emperours and Kinges haue cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
the memoriall of their birth dayes,
then there is greater reaÅ¿on, why we Å¿hould
remember the ioyfulleÅ¿t birth day that euer
was, or Å¿halbe, I meane, of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t
<pb facs="tcp:10917:39"/>
our Å¿auiour, borne Å¿o poorely and Å¿imply
for vs. Not that we Å¿hould Å¿o celebrate and
keepe ChriÅ¿ts birth day, as wicked Herode
did celebrate his natiuitie, in feaÅ¿ting, in
daunÅ¿ing, in raÅ¿h Å¿wearing, and laÅ¿t of all, in
murdering the good Å¿aint of God, Iohn
BaptiÅ¿t, <hi>Matth. 14. Mark.</hi> 6. I Å¿ay, we muÅ¿t
not Å¿o celebrate this birth day of ChriÅ¿t
with him, leaÅ¿t wee be partakers of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hment
and payne. But yet I feare a
great many doe keepe this time no better.
Neither muÅ¿t we keepe this day of our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ChriÅ¿tes birth, as Titus kept the birth
day of his brother Domitian, in killing the
Iewes for his pleaÅ¿ure, to triumphe, and
Å¿o defiled his handes with innocent blood,
Å¿urely we do not much better: for although
we kill not with the Å¿worde, yet we wound
and kill our brethren with our tongues, we
quarrel, we fight, and are contentious, wee
Å¿weare and blaÅ¿pheme, and Å¿o reuile the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
Lorde, and this is done moÅ¿t of all at
the birth day of our Sauiour, as alÅ¿o vpon
this day of reÅ¿t, the Sunday, with cardes
and dice &amp; bloody othes. Wel, the Lord one
day will take an account of theÅ¿e things of
vs, vnleÅ¿Å¿e we Å¿peedily repent and amende.
Thus we haue heard the thinges that may
<pb facs="tcp:10917:39"/>
be noted vpon ChriÅ¿tes birth, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances
of it, with the fruite that commeth
vnto vs by it, and howe wee Å¿houlde vÅ¿e this

thanke our Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t, that he woulde
be thus borne for vs, and pray vnto him that
we may remember it, and haue the ende of

his life is not here Å¿et down, becauÅ¿e we
do beleeue it in his death. This article of
ChriÅ¿ts death is very neceÅ¿Å¿ary; for nothing
had bene brought to paÅ¿Å¿e for our Å¿aluation,
neither Å¿hould we haue had any profite at al
by ChriÅ¿t, vnleÅ¿Å¿e he had bin crucified for vs.
Therefore it is not Å¿ufficient to beleeue his

are fiue things noted vnto vs. FirÅ¿t, vnder
<pb facs="tcp:10917:40"/>
whom he Å¿uffered, &amp; what iudge condemned
him: Å¿econdly, what maner of death he died,
he was crucified: thirdly, his death it Å¿elfe:
fourthly, what was done after, he was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
&amp; laÅ¿tly, what paines he Å¿uffered, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cended
into hel. Al theÅ¿e things are expreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed
vnto vs in this one article: firÅ¿t is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto vs the name of him that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ChriÅ¿t, which is Pilate a Romane, as
<hi>Iohn</hi> 19. And this his name is Å¿et downe,
not only for the credit of the hiÅ¿torie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
it the better, but alÅ¿o becauÅ¿e this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained
to the miÅ¿terie of our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
that we might knowe his death to bee ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the condemnation of an earthly
iudge. For Å¿eeing that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of ChriÅ¿t
not onely our Å¿innes muÅ¿t bee purged, but
alÅ¿o the condemnation for them to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away: it was neceÅ¿Å¿ary that hee Å¿hould
die by the Å¿entence of a iudge, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e,
that we might be abÅ¿olued before the
great iudge of all the worlde. If ChriÅ¿t
had been killed by theefes, or murdered in
a tumult or Å¿edition by priuate men, there
had bene no redemption for vs in Å¿uch a
death, no kinde of Å¿atiÅ¿faction. But when
we reade in the EuangeliÅ¿tes in their GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
that he was arraigned at the barre, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿ed
<pb facs="tcp:10917:41"/>
by witneÅ¿Å¿es, and condemned by the
Å¿entence of Pilate, (although iniuriouÅ¿lye,
hee pronouncing him iuÅ¿t, once or twiÅ¿e,
&amp; confeÅ¿Å¿ing that he found no fault in him)
we vnderÅ¿tand by thoÅ¿e thinges, that hee
Å¿uÅ¿tayned not the perÅ¿on of him Å¿elfe, but
of al vs moÅ¿t miÅ¿erable Å¿inners, that Å¿hould
haue bene Å¿o condemned before his father,
if he had not Å¿uffered this vnder Pontius
Pilate for vs. And here are two things
to be noted of vs, which are both confirmed
by the teÅ¿timonies of the Prophets, and do
alÅ¿o giue a notable conÅ¿olation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
to our fayth: for when wee heare
that ChriÅ¿te was Å¿ent to death, from the
iudgement Å¿eate, and was hanged betwene
the theeues, wee haue a full accompliÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that propheÅ¿ie, which is cited of
the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>geliÅ¿t, <hi>He was reckoned or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among the wicked, EÅ¿ay.</hi> 53. And why
was this Å¿o? truely, that he might Å¿uÅ¿taine
the condition and eÅ¿tate of a Å¿inner, and not
of a iuÅ¿t man, as hee Å¿uffered death, not for
righteouÅ¿nes Å¿ake, but for Å¿in and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿ions
of the wicked. Againe, when we
heare that he was pronounced innocent by
the Å¿ame man, of whome he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
let vs remember that which another
<pb facs="tcp:10917:41"/>
Prophet Å¿peaketh of him, <hi>I reÅ¿tored that
which I tooke not, PÅ¿al.</hi> 69. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, ChriÅ¿t pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Å¿in, &amp; bought if full dearely, which he
neuer had, nor committed: for there was no
guile found in his mouth. And why did Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
then condemne him? BecauÅ¿e he feared
man more then God, &amp; CeÅ¿ars diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure
more then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of God: for when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cryed, <hi>If thou let him goe, thou art not
CaeÅ¿ars friend,</hi> then he conÅ¿ented vnto them
to crucify him againÅ¿t his owne conÅ¿cience,
to pleaÅ¿ure the people, &amp; to gratifye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Tiberius.</hi> So we Å¿ee, that he was a
parcial, feareful, &amp; vniuÅ¿t iudge, &amp; had not
the properties of a good iudge, as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 18. FirÅ¿t, that they Å¿hould be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
of courage, Å¿econdly, fearing God, thirdly,
men dealing truely, fourthly, hating coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touÅ¿nes.
Let all Iudges take example &amp;
warning by Pilate, to execute iuÅ¿tice and
iudgement indifferently to all men. For
Pilate afterward, as hiÅ¿tories recorde, for
anguiÅ¿h and Å¿orowe of minde hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe,
as Iudas did before him. And here
wee Å¿ee, that as a Romane then condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ChriÅ¿t, and as alwayes afterwarde hee
was perÅ¿ecuted by the Romaine Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
Å¿o it is at this day by that great
<pb facs="tcp:10917:42"/>
AntichriÅ¿t of Rome, the Pope and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herentes:
he is Å¿till perÅ¿ecuted in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
This is the iuÅ¿t iudgement of God
vpon them. God giue them grace (if it bee
his will) to repent, &amp; to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the trueth, Amen. Secondly, let
vs conÅ¿ider the maner of his death what it
was. It was the croÅ¿Å¿e, moÅ¿t Å¿hamefull and
accurÅ¿ed, not onely in mans Å¿ight, but alÅ¿o
of God him Å¿elfe. <hi>Deut. 21. The curÅ¿e of
God is on him that is hanged.</hi> This Paul
repeateth, <hi>Gala.</hi> 3. and Å¿aith, <hi>ChriÅ¿t hath
redeemed vs from the curÅ¿e of the lawe,
being made a curÅ¿e for vs, for it is written:
CurÅ¿ed is euery one that hangeth on tree.</hi>
Thus we Å¿ee Å¿till in euery article, and in
euery point of our Å¿aluation, that excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great loue of ChriÅ¿t our maÅ¿ter to vs,
that not onely he was contented to Å¿uffer
moÅ¿t grieous paine for vs, but alÅ¿o Å¿hame
and reproche, ignominie and contempt of
the worlde. He was at the firÅ¿t taking, led
away to Annas and Caiaphas, and then
poÅ¿ted ouer to Pilate. Pilate Å¿ent him to
Herode, and Herode Å¿ent him back againe
with mockes and tauntes in a purple robe
in mockage, &amp; deriÅ¿ion of him. And all this
did our Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t for vs. This was
<pb facs="tcp:10917:42"/>
much that I haue rehearÅ¿ed already, but
yet nothing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of the croÅ¿Å¿e: for the
croÅ¿Å¿e was as odious &amp; Å¿hameful to them, as
the gallowes is to vs, &amp; yet ChriÅ¿t was wel
contented with it, Å¿o wee might bee redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
This is that Paul Å¿peaketh of to the
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. willing vs to follow the great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie
of ChriÅ¿t in his Å¿uffering of Å¿hame,
Å¿aith, <hi>Let vs alÅ¿o, Å¿eeing that we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿ed
with Å¿o great a cloude of witneÅ¿Å¿es,
caÅ¿t away euery thing that preÅ¿Å¿eth down,
and Å¿inne that hangeth Å¿o faÅ¿t on: let vs
runne with patience, the race that is Å¿et
before vs, looking vnto IeÅ¿us the author &amp;
finiÅ¿her of our faith, who for the ioy that
was Å¿et before him, endured the croÅ¿Å¿e, &amp;
deÅ¿piÅ¿ed the Å¿hame, and is Å¿et at the right
hand of the throne of God. ConÅ¿ider
therfore him that endured Å¿uch Å¿peaking
agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿t of Å¿inners, leÅ¿t ye Å¿hould be wearied
and faint in your mindes.</hi> We Å¿ee many
men can abide to Å¿uffer paine and griefe,
which yet notwithÅ¿tanding are ouercome
with Å¿hame and reproche, and can hardly
abide it. One peraduenture could bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to Å¿uffer Å¿ome trouble for his deare
friende, but who will bee hanged for his
friende? <hi>Let the Å¿ame minde therefore
<pb facs="tcp:10917:43"/>
dearely beloued be in you, that was euen
in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, who being in the forme
of God, thought it no robberie to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
with God, but hee made himÅ¿elfe of
no reputation, and tooke on him the Å¿hape
of a Å¿eruant, and was made like vnto men,
and was found in Å¿hape as a man: he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himÅ¿elfe, and became obedient vnto
the death, euen the death of the croÅ¿Å¿e.</hi>
You Å¿ee out of this place, howe ChriÅ¿t for
our Å¿akes abaÅ¿ed himÅ¿elfe to Å¿hame, which
conÅ¿iÅ¿teth in foure poyntes. It was much
for him being God, to become man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it had bene King, or Prince, or Lorde:
but it was more to become a miÅ¿erable
man, a Å¿eruant vnto men: more then that,
it was to die: but moÅ¿t of all was it worthy
prayÅ¿e and commendation, that he died the
death of the croÅ¿Å¿e, not for his friendes, but
for his foes. Many other thinges did our
Å¿auiour Å¿uffer of the people, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scribes, the
PhariÅ¿es, &amp; the Iewes: as reuilings, &amp; blaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,
bitter nippes, and tauntes, but al
was nothing to this croÅ¿Å¿e, it Å¿urmounteth
all: &amp; yet for all this, we muÅ¿t not be aÅ¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of him, for hee is our glory, <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.
1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. they that are aÅ¿hamed of him
here in earth before men, he wil be aÅ¿hamed
<pb facs="tcp:10917:43"/>
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> before his father &amp; his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
Let vs therfore confeÅ¿Å¿e and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ChriÅ¿t crucified for vs, and let vs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be aÅ¿hamed of him, when hee commeth
with his croÅ¿Å¿e, for he that taketh not vp his
croÅ¿Å¿e dayly &amp; followeth him, is not worthy
to be his diÅ¿ciple, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. He might rather
haue bene aÅ¿hamed of vs, to Å¿ee vs in that
caÅ¿e we were, worÅ¿er then wee can Å¿ee any
poore miÅ¿erable begger, amongÅ¿t vs here
in earth. We Å¿ee then, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by ChriÅ¿t crucified,
the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of Abraham is come vpon vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
were Gentiles, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the Å¿erpents
head is broken, he being y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> true Å¿erpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t lifted
vp vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croÅ¿Å¿e, to Å¿aue al thoÅ¿e that hope
vpon him by fayth, as the other braÅ¿en Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
lyfted vp by MoÅ¿es in the wildernes,
Å¿aued all thoÅ¿e IÅ¿raelites y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> were Å¿tong, &amp;
looked vp vnto it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. verÅ¿e. 9. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
by this croÅ¿Å¿e, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hande writing of
ordinances which was againÅ¿t vs, &amp; which
was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>trary to vs, he, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he tooke it out of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, &amp; faÅ¿tened it vpon the croÅ¿Å¿e, &amp; hath
Å¿poyled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> principalities, &amp; powers, &amp; hath
made a Å¿hew of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ly, &amp; hath triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>phed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿ame croÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. Of this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying,
&amp; lifting vp vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croÅ¿Å¿e, was IÅ¿aac
a figure, who was bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d &amp; laid vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> altar,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:44"/>
ready to be offered. And Å¿o were al the Å¿inne
offerings layde vpon the altar: for he was
made of God his father Å¿inne for vs, that
wee might he made the righteouÅ¿nes of
God in him, which knewe no Å¿inne, 2. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi>
5. But of all other types and Å¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
of the ceremonial lawe, this taking
away of Å¿inne by ChriÅ¿t in his croÅ¿Å¿e, was
moÅ¿t liuely Å¿et forth and repreÅ¿ented vnto
vs, as in a glaÅ¿Å¿e, in the Å¿caps goate. For the
Lord commanded Aaron <hi>Leuit.</hi> 16. that
he Å¿hould take a liue hee goate, and preÅ¿ent
him quicke before the Lorde, to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
by him, and that he Å¿hould put
his handes vpon the head of the goate, and
confeÅ¿Å¿e ouer him all the iniquities of the
children of IÅ¿rael, and all their treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿es, &amp;
all their Å¿innes, putting them vpon the
head of the goate, &amp; Å¿hould Å¿end him away,
by the hande of a man appointed, into the
wildernes: Å¿o the goate Å¿hall beare vpon
him all their iniquities into the lande that
is not inhabited. Here was our Å¿auiour
ChriÅ¿t figured, <hi>which bare in his body vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
the croÅ¿Å¿e, the iniquities of vs al, EÅ¿ai.</hi> 53.
1. <hi>Pet. 2. and was wounded for our tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿ions,
and caried away al our Å¿orowes,
for by his Å¿tripes are wee healed. EÅ¿ay.</hi> 53.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:44"/>
Furthermore, this betraying and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿elling of him for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pence, was alÅ¿o forefigured in IoÅ¿eph.
For as IoÅ¿eph was Å¿olde of his owne bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
into the handes of Å¿trangers: Å¿o was
ChriÅ¿t betrayed and Å¿old of his owne diÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
anddeliuered of his owne nation into
the handes of Pilate and the Heathen. The
third thing that followeth in this article, is
his death. He was dead in deede, as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliÅ¿tes
doe report: for Luke Å¿ayth of
him, <hi>that he cryed with a loude voyce and
Å¿ayde, Father, into thy hands I commend
my Å¿pirit. And when he had thus Å¿ayd, he
gaue vp the ghoÅ¿t, Luk</hi> 23. So for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of it, it is not onely Å¿aid that he was
crucified, but alÅ¿o that he died: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e
nothing had bene wrought for vs.
God Å¿ayde to Adam, <hi>In what day Å¿oeuer
thou Å¿halt eate of the forbidden tree of
knowledge of good and euill, thou Å¿halt
die the death.</hi> Adam offended and brake
this commandement: hee was not able to
make Å¿atiÅ¿faction for it, to die the death of
body and Å¿oule: therfore the Å¿econd Adam
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t died the death of body, &amp; Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the death in Å¿oule, to redeeme vs, and
to Å¿atiÅ¿fie Gods wrath &amp; diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb facs="tcp:10917:45"/>
moÅ¿t iuÅ¿tly againÅ¿t our Å¿inne in
Adam. This death was Å¿ignified in euery
Å¿acrifice of beaÅ¿tes in the olde lawe of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es,
in the killing of bullockes, of calues,
of Å¿heepe, of goates, and Å¿uch other things.
For as the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿ayth, <hi>without Å¿hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of blood was no remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes.</hi>
This was verified in ChriÅ¿tes blood, Å¿hed
for vs in his death. Neither was this death
of ChriÅ¿t to be Å¿eene onely Å¿hadowed in the
ceremonies of the Leuiticall lawe, but alÅ¿o
in diuers men. As SamÅ¿on, who died him
Å¿elfe to deliuer his people from the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tims:
Å¿o ChriÅ¿t, to deliuer vs from the
deuils, died him Å¿elfe. Dauid alÅ¿o was
a figure of him in many thinges. Here we
Å¿ee then, what a grieuous thing Å¿inne was
in Gods Å¿ight, that he could be pacified by
no other meanes, then by the blood &amp; death
of his only and welbeloued Sonne IeÅ¿us.
Surely our Å¿innes were as hard as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant
Å¿tone, which could not be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> by
any other meanes, then by the blood of the
true goate IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. ConÅ¿ider here the
wonderfull &amp; vnÅ¿peakeable loue of ChriÅ¿t:
he would die for vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might eÅ¿cape: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pelicane, which hauing brought forth
<pb facs="tcp:10917:45"/>
her young ones dead, or being Å¿tong &amp; kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by Å¿erpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tes, Å¿he pecketh forth her heart
blood to reuiue her young ones: Å¿o we, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conceiued and borne in Å¿inne, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
dead in our treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿es and offences,
<hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 2. Å¿tong of that old and fiery Å¿erpent
the diuell, which firÅ¿t beguiled our parents
in paradiÅ¿e, and Å¿o hauing the rewarde of
Å¿inne which is death: we (I Å¿ay) in this caÅ¿e
are reuiued and quickened againe, by the
blood of that true Pelicane IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,
which hee from his heart hath Å¿head and
powred out for vs. Thus we Å¿ee how deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we are indebted to ChriÅ¿t for his great
loue to vs, in dying for our Å¿innes, and yet
how fewe remember this death! Many, not
once in a day, nay, not once in a weeke, or
moneth, I feare, Å¿ome, not once in a whole
yeere doe remember it well: they are the
more vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>keful, &amp; vnkind Å¿onnes to God

It is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Å¿hould eÅ¿pecially

<pb facs="tcp:10917:46"/>
his laÅ¿t Å¿upper, in bread &amp; wine: the
bread broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, to put vs in minde of his moÅ¿t
pure &amp; pretious body broken &amp; bruiÅ¿ed for
our Å¿innes, &amp; that it doeth nouriÅ¿h vs, as the
bread doth nouriÅ¿h our bodies: <hi>for his fleÅ¿h
is meat in deede Iohn</hi> 6. The wine ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to put vs in mind of his blood powred
out for vs, <hi>to waÅ¿h vs from al our Å¿innes,
1. Iohn</hi> 1. &amp; that as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine doth quench our
thirÅ¿t, and refreÅ¿h vs, &amp; comfort our hearts
being Å¿oroweful: Å¿o doeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blood of ChriÅ¿t
al theÅ¿e things vnto vs, in greater meaÅ¿ure
and abundance. This doeth alÅ¿o teache vs
vnitie &amp; loue together, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as many grapes
make but one wine, and many graynes of
corne &amp; wheate make but one lofe of bread:
Å¿o Å¿hould we be but one in ChriÅ¿t our head,
for we are all members of the Å¿ame body.
The other Å¿acrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t alÅ¿o of BaptiÅ¿me, doth
put vs in minde of ChriÅ¿tes death: for as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
water in baptiÅ¿me doth waÅ¿h the body: Å¿o
doeth the blood of ChriÅ¿t waÅ¿h our Å¿oules,
and clenÅ¿e them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> their filthines. Which
thing is repreÅ¿ented vnto vs in our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me,
a Å¿igne of our newe birth and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
by the Å¿pirite of ChriÅ¿t. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in our baptiÅ¿me we ought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
this death, for wee are buried with him
<pb facs="tcp:10917:46"/>
into his death, by this Å¿eale and Å¿acrament
of our baptiÅ¿me, as Paul proueth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.
Nowe we Å¿ee, that to the ende we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
this great benefite of ChriÅ¿tes
death, we haue tokens of it, two in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
the Å¿upper of ChriÅ¿t, and baptiÅ¿me: for
<hi>by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> we Å¿hew forth the Lords death, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he come againe to iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, 1. Cor.</hi> 11.
Nowe if any man marueile why we dye,
Å¿ince ChriÅ¿t hath died for vs, &amp; taÅ¿ted death
once for all men, to make reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> for
the Å¿innes of the people, &amp; to Å¿atiÅ¿fie Gods
iuÅ¿tice: he may be anÅ¿wered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ChriÅ¿t hath
taken away the Å¿econd death of the Å¿oule, &amp;
not this firÅ¿t &amp; naturall death of the body,
which is common to all, for by it we enter
into life: and although it be Å¿ometime grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
to Gods children, yet it is not deadly
to them, nay rather, ioyfull, Å¿eeing by it
they come to ChriÅ¿t their head, as it was
to Paul: <hi>I deÅ¿ire,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>to be looÅ¿ed, and
to be with ChriÅ¿t,</hi> meaning, to die. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
this death of the body dwelleth in vs,
yet it hath no dominion ouer vs, by the
force and efficacie of ChriÅ¿tes death. And
wee knowe that it is made nowe to the
elect, a gate to paÅ¿Å¿e by into heauen. We
Å¿hould not then feare death, Å¿eeing that
<pb facs="tcp:10917:47"/>
the loÅ¿Å¿e of this tranÅ¿itory life, is the high
way into Gods euerlaÅ¿ting kingdome.
And this may bee anÅ¿wered concerning
Å¿inne alÅ¿o. If any man aÅ¿ke, howe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to paÅ¿Å¿e, that wee haue Å¿inne Å¿till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in vs, Å¿eeing ChriÅ¿t hath died for
it to take it away: I anÅ¿were, that ChriÅ¿t
hath taken awaye the condemnation of
Å¿inne, that it Å¿hall not hurt vs, to bring vs
to deÅ¿truction, but the full aboliÅ¿hing of
Å¿inne Å¿hall ceaÅ¿e in the latter day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when all thinges Å¿hall bee reÅ¿tored
againe to their perfection, <hi>Actes</hi> 5. So
that now we may Å¿ay, There is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Å¿inne to them that are in ChriÅ¿t
IeÅ¿us, which walke not after the fleÅ¿h, but
after the Å¿pirite, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. For Å¿ee the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
working of God, that all the curÅ¿es
and paynes that were in IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, are
turned to our bleÅ¿Å¿ings and ioyes: his death
is our life, his pouerty our riches, his Å¿hame
our glory, his deÅ¿cenÅ¿ion into hell, is made
our aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion into heauen: and finally, his
miÅ¿ery here in this life, is made our felicitie
and happineÅ¿Å¿e in the life to come. This is
the Lordes doing, and it is marueilous in
our eyes. O that men would therefore
prayÅ¿e the Lorde for his goodnes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb facs="tcp:10917:47"/>
the wonders that hee doeth for the
children of men! This death of ChriÅ¿te
hath two benefites in it: for firÅ¿t it cauÅ¿eth
that wee Å¿hall not die in the life to come,
and then here it mortifieth our earthly
members, it killeth our olde man Adam
within vs, that it bringeth not foorth his
accuÅ¿tomed actions of Å¿inne within vs.
Thus much concerning his death. Let vs
nowe conÅ¿ider briefly the fourth poynt in
this article, which is his buriall. ChriÅ¿te
was buried by an honourable CounÅ¿eller,
IoÅ¿eph of Arimathea, and Nicodemus,
a ruler of the Iewes, who begged his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
boldly of Pilate, and buried it with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
as the maner was, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. His
buriall is mentioned, to aÅ¿Å¿ure vs that hee
died in deede, as when wee Å¿ee a man bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
wee doubt not but that hee is dead.
The leÅ¿Å¿on that we learne by this buriall of
ChriÅ¿t, is this, as the ApoÅ¿tle Paul teacheth
vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. and <hi>ColoÅ¿.</hi> 2. that we Å¿hould
Å¿o through baptiÅ¿me bee freed and buried
from Å¿inne, as he was buried in the graue,
that like as ChriÅ¿te was rayÅ¿ed vp from
the dead to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glorie of his father: Å¿o we alÅ¿o
Å¿hould walke in newenes of life. So then,
as we are crucified with ChriÅ¿t vnto Å¿inne,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:48"/>
and dead and buried thereto, Å¿o muÅ¿t wee
riÅ¿e againe with him vnto righteouÅ¿nes.
But of this, more (God willing) in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> article
of his reÅ¿urrection. The laÅ¿t thing to be
noted in this death of ChriÅ¿t, is the paynes
which he Å¿uffered, which is called his deÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenÅ¿ion
into hell. Although this bee laÅ¿t in
wordes, yet in Å¿enÅ¿e it is to be ioyned with
his crucifying, and went before his death in
body, and buriall in the Å¿epulchre. The
meaning therefore of this his deÅ¿cenÅ¿ion, is
this: that ChriÅ¿t our Å¿auiour, to redeeme
vs both in body and Å¿oule, which had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
God, Å¿uffered the tormentes of hell, the
wrath infinite of his father for the time, not
onely in body, but alÅ¿o in Å¿oule, and did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
the moÅ¿t bitter and vnÅ¿peakeable Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
of death in his minde and conÅ¿cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce,
preÅ¿Å¿ed downe with the burden of all our
Å¿innes, as if hee had bene forÅ¿aken of God
his father. In this hell and torment, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he was in his heauy agony in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
when he Å¿wette (as it were) teares of
blood trickling downe from his face: his
Å¿oule was verie heauie and Å¿orowfull, euen
vnto the death, Å¿o that there came an angel
and comforted him from heauen, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.
This hell was Å¿o great vnto him, that he
<pb facs="tcp:10917:48"/>
prayed his Father, <hi>if it were poÅ¿Å¿ible, that
the cuppe of his paÅ¿Å¿ion myght paÅ¿Å¿e from
him:</hi> Yea, which was moÅ¿t of all, he was
compelled for the very anguiÅ¿h and griefe
of heart and Å¿oule,<note place="margin">PÅ¿al. 22. 1.</note> to Å¿ay and cry out: <hi>O my
God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 27. 46.</note> 
                     <hi>my God, why haÅ¿t thou forÅ¿aken
me?</hi> So that all the things that ChriÅ¿t Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
before, were nothing to this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> now he
Å¿uffered, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he cryed out for very payne, &amp;
extreme Å¿orowe of minde. For we muÅ¿t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ber,
that ChriÅ¿t vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croÅ¿Å¿e, did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Å¿uffer paines in body, (as they did which
were crucified w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, which were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paines
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes did put him to) but farther, he
Å¿uffered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> extreme wrath of God his father,
hanging vpon him, heauier then heauen and
earth, which no angel was able to endure: &amp;
therfore, that he might be able to endure and
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>quer it, it was neceÅ¿Å¿arie, that he Å¿hould
be God alÅ¿o, as well as man. For he Å¿uffred
for all the Å¿innes, originall, and actuall, in
thought, worde and deede, of all men that
euer were or are, or Å¿hall be from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the worlde, from Adam vntill the
ende of it, I Å¿ay, he hath Å¿uffred Å¿ufficiently
for them all, and as great paynes and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as any damned Å¿oules in hell can or
Å¿hall Å¿uffer. And was not this an hell (trowe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:49"/>
you) vnto our Sauiour, to abide in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and Å¿oule, all theÅ¿e torments, which can
not be vttered with any eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce or tongue
of man? Nothing had bene done for vs, if
ChriÅ¿t had dyed the common death of the
body onely, as other dyd. It was neceÅ¿Å¿arie
therefore and very expedient, that we might
be perfectly redeemed in both partes both
body and Å¿oule, that hee Å¿houle feele the
Å¿euere puniÅ¿hment of the vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce of God,
becauÅ¿e he powred out his Å¿oule an offering
for Å¿inne, and tooke vpon him our part,
which were the malefactors and offendors,
to bring vs vnto the fauour of God againe.
We muÅ¿t not thinke then, (yea God forbid
we Å¿houlde) that he Å¿uffered no more payne
then the Iewes put him to, or the other two
dyd which hanged with him. For we Å¿ee
they cryed not out as ChriÅ¿t dyd, for they
felt not Å¿o much as he did, which Å¿uffred for
the whole worlde. And all this was for our
cauÅ¿e: Let vs then applie it as a medicine
to our wounds, otherwiÅ¿e it will not heale
vs. Take the Å¿hielde of fayth, that when
yee are in great torment and griefe for
your Å¿innes, (as Satan doeth many times
obiect them vnto you) when yee are euen
at the brinke of deÅ¿peration, then this will
<pb facs="tcp:10917:49"/>
be a notable comfort vnto you, to beare off
all aÅ¿Å¿aultes and grieuous tentations, yea,
to quench the fiery dartes of the deuil, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t Å¿uffered
the torments of hel euery one of them, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
you from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. This one leÅ¿Å¿on, if it be
well learned, &amp; Å¿urely Å¿etled in our hearts,
will heale a wounded conÅ¿cience, will rayÅ¿e
vs vp from the gates of hel, and will in our
greateÅ¿t diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e, be very Å¿weet vnto vs. Be
our Å¿innes neuer Å¿o many, either as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿ands
of the Å¿ea, or as the Å¿tarres of heauen, as they
can not be Å¿o many: yet ChriÅ¿ts mercy is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> all, &amp; greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they, &amp; hath paide
a Å¿ufficient price and ranÅ¿ome for them all.
If they were as redde as purple or as crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on:
yet they Å¿halbe made as white as wool,
and like to Å¿nowe, EÅ¿ay. 1. A notable &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
place: for before, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet Å¿harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rebuked them of their grieuous Å¿innes
and offences, and nowe in theÅ¿e words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿eth
them mercy, if they will repent and
amende, and Å¿o turne to the Lord with their
whole heart. In this, that ChriÅ¿t hath Å¿uffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the tormentes of hell for all, we gather,
that all that are Å¿aued, are Å¿aued by ChriÅ¿t
alone, from Adam vntill this time, and to
the ende of all the world: for he is the lambe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:50"/>
Å¿layne from the beginning of the worlde,
Reuel. 13. That is to Å¿ay, his death and
paÅ¿Å¿ion was as effectuall to redeeme al that
were before him, that dyd beleeue in him
that he Å¿houlde come, as it was auayleable
afterwarde to Å¿aue all that are after him,
which do beleeue that he is come in the fleÅ¿h
already to Å¿aue them. This is that, that our
Sauiour meant, when he Å¿ayde,<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 56.</note> that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
reioyced to Å¿ee his dayes, and Å¿awe
them:</hi> that is, reioyced in ChriÅ¿t, that he
Å¿houlde be his Sauiour.<note place="margin">Actes 4. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>For none other is
there giuen vnder heauen wherin we muÅ¿t
be Å¿aued, Actes.</hi> 4. Thus wee Å¿ee what is
meant by theÅ¿e words, <hi>deÅ¿cended into hell:</hi>
howe he Å¿uffered helliÅ¿h tormentes for vs,
not that his Å¿oule went into hell after his
death, for it was in paradiÅ¿e, in the hands of
God, as he commended it to his Father, &amp;
as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿oules of the bleÅ¿Å¿ed are, &amp; his body was
in the graue. Neither is there any place of
Å¿cripture to proue any other diÅ¿cenÅ¿ion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
this, which is ful of trueth &amp; comfort. They
alledge y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> place of Dauid, PÅ¿al. 16. 10. But
that doth proue vnto vs his reÅ¿urrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that
his body Å¿houlde not be left in the graue, as
others were, to Å¿ee corruption and to rotte,
as Peter doeth apply it, <hi>Act,</hi> 2. 27. to proue
<pb facs="tcp:10917:50"/>
his reÅ¿urrection from death, and not his deÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenÅ¿ion
into hell. The place of 1. Peter. 3.
doeth Å¿hewe, that <hi>the Spirite of ChriÅ¿t was
in the dayes of Noe, and preached by him
to the wicked which were then rebellious
and diÅ¿obedient, and are nowe damned
Å¿oules in hell,</hi> which he tearmeth <hi>Å¿pirites in
pryÅ¿on.</hi> This is the meaning of Peter in
that place, (as alÅ¿o good interpreters doe
prooue.) Neyther did ChriÅ¿t deÅ¿cende into
hell to fetch the godly Patriarkes from
thence, which dyed in his faith before his
comming in the fleÅ¿h, for they were in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
already as concerning the Å¿oule, for <hi>the
Å¿oules of the righteous are in the hands of
God, and no torment Å¿hall touch them,
WiÅ¿d.</hi> 3. Here then Å¿eeing ChriÅ¿t hath Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
and fulfilled all things for vs, we may
Å¿aye to God as concerning his iuÅ¿tice, O
righteous God, if Å¿hame, confuÅ¿ion and
ignominie bee due to Å¿inners for their euill
deÅ¿ertes, if death bee the Å¿tipende and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of Å¿inne, Rom. 6. 23. If it deÅ¿erue thy
wrath and indignation moÅ¿t Å¿euere, If it be
worthy to be puniÅ¿hed not onely with moÅ¿t
Å¿harpe paynes of body, but alÅ¿o extreeme
torments of mynd and conÅ¿cience: briefely,
if it deÅ¿erue hell and damnation for the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e
<pb facs="tcp:10917:51"/>
and filthineÅ¿Å¿e of it: Then O moÅ¿t iuÅ¿t
Father and God, ChriÅ¿t thy Sonne hath
Å¿uffered all theÅ¿e thinges to the vtmoÅ¿t, hee
hath paide al whatÅ¿oeuer thou canÅ¿t require
of mee, for Å¿inne,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 14.</note> he hath perfourmed thy
bande and obligation, and hath clearely can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celed
the handwriting that was againÅ¿t me.
For can there bee a greater burden with
meaÅ¿ure more heaped and full, and preÅ¿Å¿ed
downe, appoynted for Å¿inne and iniquitie,
then this was, which ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
&amp; only Sonne, which was in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ome,
hath borne already for me? Therefore
I beÅ¿eeche thee moÅ¿t deare and tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whenÅ¿oeuer my Å¿innes Å¿hall come into
thy Å¿ight, or queÅ¿tion with thee, which my
aduerÅ¿arie the deuill layeth before thee and
me, that then thou wouldeÅ¿t looke vpon
ChriÅ¿t thy Sonne, which is thy true loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
glaÅ¿Å¿e, in whom thou Å¿halt finde me to
be moÅ¿t pure and innocent, and to be of the
Å¿ame white colour with him, and to Å¿hine
moÅ¿t bryght in his righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, which he
giueth vnto me by faith, if I beleeue in him,
as I can perÅ¿wade my Å¿elfe moÅ¿t certainely
and vnfaynedly that I doe. Good Father,
for his Å¿ake receiue me into mercie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿towe
thy heauenly bleÅ¿Å¿ings vpon me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e
<pb facs="tcp:10917:51"/>
hee hath deÅ¿erued them well at thy
handes. This prayer with boldneÅ¿Å¿e and
confidence in ChriÅ¿tes blood, may a true
ChriÅ¿tian man make to God the Father,
when his Å¿innes Å¿hall begin to accuÅ¿e him:
and herein may he finde comfort, otherwiÅ¿e
none at all. For God is not pleaÅ¿ed, but in
ChriÅ¿t and in his doings, as he Å¿aith, <hi>This
is my welbeloued Sonne, heare him, Matt.
3. and</hi> 17. Where we note, that ChriÅ¿t is
our onely reconciler to God, and our onely
Å¿cholemaÅ¿ter to teach vs the trueth of Gods
worde. Thus haue we heard in this article,
the death of ChriÅ¿t, a wonderfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿peakable
myÅ¿terie, the circumÅ¿tances of it,
the cauÅ¿e of the Å¿ame, the paines he Å¿uffered,
and what comfort we haue and enioy by it.
Nowe let vs giue to our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moÅ¿t heartie, earneÅ¿t, and continuall
thankes for it, and likewiÅ¿e to IeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t, that woulde vouchÅ¿afe to take it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him for our Å¿akes, Å¿uch poore and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erable
wretches as wee were. It is the
greateÅ¿t and moÅ¿t precious Iewel and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monde
that God coulde beÅ¿towe vpon vs.
Let vs therefore pray vnto him, to make vs
deepely conÅ¿ider of the valewe of it in our
hearts and mindes, that we Å¿lightly eÅ¿teeme
<pb facs="tcp:10917:52"/>
not of Å¿o excellent a treaÅ¿ure, but that wee
may Å¿ell all, and buy it. Let vs further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
deÅ¿ire of him, that by the death of his
Sonne, hee woulde kill in vs all carnall
and worldly luÅ¿tes, and mortifie our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
members, pride, concupiÅ¿cence, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hatred, couetouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿uch lyke
Å¿innes, that wee walke in them no more.
Nowe Å¿eeing ChriÅ¿t hath dyed for them, to
put them all away, and hath faÅ¿tned and
nayled them to his CroÅ¿Å¿e, that we Å¿houlde
Å¿erue him (being deliuered from the handes
of our enemies) without feare, all the

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third day he Å¿hal riÅ¿e again.</hi> This was Å¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to comfort them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
great care &amp; Å¿orow, in heari<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he Å¿hould
be killed, yet they might take as great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
againe to heare, that hee was riÅ¿en from
the dead. ChriÅ¿tes enemies did in deede what
they might and coulde, to keep him downe
Å¿till: they layd a great Å¿tone and heauie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his graue, they Å¿ealed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿tone, they made
<pb facs="tcp:10917:53"/>
the Å¿epulchre Å¿ure w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a watch of Å¿ouldiers,
Matth. 27. 66. But all was in vayne: for
ChriÅ¿t muÅ¿t needes be true of his worde and
promiÅ¿e, to ariÅ¿e againe the third day, as he
had often foretolde and prophecied of to his
ApoÅ¿tles, and of the which they were al wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿es,
and as S. Paul Å¿aith, <hi>moe then fiue
hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dred brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> at once did Å¿ee him.</hi> If any
require teÅ¿timonies of his reÅ¿urrection out
of Å¿cripture, let him read the 28. of <hi>Matth.</hi>
the 16 of <hi>Mar.</hi> the 24. of <hi>Luke,</hi> the 20. &amp; 21.
of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. with many other
places of Å¿cripture. Wherefore no man can
doubt of the trueth of this article, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by Å¿o many places of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God.
This reÅ¿urrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> was very neceÅ¿Å¿ary: for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e
it had folowed, and ChriÅ¿t riÅ¿en again,
nothing had bene wrought concerning our
Å¿aluation, neither had death bene conquered,
nor Å¿ata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> deÅ¿troied, nor we redeemed perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the dolours of death. Therefore S.
Peter Å¿aith, <hi>that God hath raiÅ¿ed him vp, &amp;
looÅ¿ed the Å¿orowes of death, becauÅ¿e it was
vnpoÅ¿Å¿ible that he Å¿houlde be holden of it,</hi>
Acts 2. 24. as Dauid alÅ¿o proueth, PÅ¿a. 16.
<hi>Thou Å¿halt not leaue my Å¿oule in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graue,
neither Å¿halt thou Å¿uffer thy holy one to Å¿ee
corruption.</hi> This article doth proue vnto
<pb facs="tcp:10917:53"/>
vs, that ChriÅ¿t is both man and God:man, in
that he did riÅ¿e with his body in the which he
fell and died before, for it is vnproper to Å¿ay
that God doth riÅ¿e againe, for he doth neuer
fall. His reÅ¿urrection doth proue him to be
God alÅ¿o, becauÅ¿e he rayÅ¿ed vp himÅ¿elfe the
third day, as he teÅ¿tifieth, <hi>DeÅ¿troy this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
(meaning of his body) <hi>and in three daies
I wil reare it vp agayne, Ioh.</hi> 2. 20. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o
Å¿aide, that he was rayÅ¿ed vp by the glorie
of his father, but that is Å¿poke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> as concerning
his humanity, wherin he is inferior to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Seeing then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the croÅ¿Å¿e, death &amp; bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
of ChriÅ¿t, doth appeare a kinde of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
and weakenes in reÅ¿pect of the world,
becauÅ¿e theÅ¿e things in ChriÅ¿t Å¿eeme baÅ¿e to
many: wee haue to goe further for the full
Å¿trengthening of our faith, to his moÅ¿t glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
&amp; victorious reÅ¿urrection ouer al his
enemies: for although we haue a ful accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliÅ¿hment
of our Å¿aluation in his death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e
that by it wee are reconciled to God,
and Å¿atiÅ¿factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> is made to his iuÅ¿tice for our
Å¿innes, Å¿o that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> curÅ¿e is taken away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vs,
&amp; the puniÅ¿hme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t paid for our offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ces: yet for
al this, we are Å¿aid <hi>to be begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     </hi> (not by his

eÅ¿pecially in his reÅ¿urrection, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> as the
holy ApoÅ¿tle doth plainly expreÅ¿Å¿e it, Rom.
4. 25. for he Å¿aith, <hi>that ChriÅ¿t was deliuered
from our Å¿innes, but is riÅ¿en againe for our
iuÅ¿tificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>:</hi> as if he Å¿hould Å¿ay, By his death

and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e was reÅ¿tored &amp; renewed
vnto vs by his reÅ¿urrection from death.
For otherwiÅ¿e, how could he haue deliuered
vs from death by dying, if he himÅ¿elf had bin
Å¿wallowed vp of death? or howe Å¿hould he
haue gotten vs the victorie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had loÅ¿t it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf?
This thing the Prophete OÅ¿ee foreÅ¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

death, I wil be thy death, O graue, I wil be
thy deÅ¿truction,</hi> OÅ¿ee, Chap. 13. verÅ¿e. 14.
Wherfore we do in this Å¿ort diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
of his death from the benefites of his
reÅ¿urrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. By his death Å¿inne is aboliÅ¿hed:
by his reÅ¿urrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> righteouÅ¿nes is reÅ¿tored:
by his death is death extinguiÅ¿hed: by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urrection

one, hel gates are broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vp &amp; va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>quiÅ¿hed, &amp; by
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dores of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> are vnÅ¿hut &amp; opened

his death &amp; reÅ¿urrection, although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
one Å¿ometime is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, &amp; al things
are giuen and applied to his death whatÅ¿oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
we inioy. Here may be a queÅ¿tion, why
ChriÅ¿t was three dayes in the Å¿epulchre.
FirÅ¿t I may Å¿ay, It was to fulfill the Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
for Ionas was a figure &amp; Å¿igne of his
reÅ¿urrection: now as Ionas was three daies
and three nightes in the fiÅ¿hes belly, Å¿o was
ChriÅ¿t in the graue. Agayne, hee was there
three dayes, and did not riÅ¿e by &amp; by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
after his death, to confirme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> certaintie
of his death, that he was dead in deede: for if
he Å¿hould haue riÅ¿en Å¿traight way, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> might
haue thought with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿elues that he had not
<pb facs="tcp:10917:55"/>
bin throughly dead. Againe, although it be
Å¿aid that he was three dayes and three nights
in the heart of the earth, yet was he there but
part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>: for the Å¿cripture doth take a part
&amp; halfe of a day for a whole day, as alÅ¿o part
of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. Wheras it is Å¿aide,
<hi>there were Å¿o many Å¿oules in the Å¿hip with
Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Actes 27. 37.</note> it is meant, Å¿o many men in al with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
&amp; Å¿oules: but the better, greater, &amp; excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenter
part is vÅ¿ually taken for the whole, as
in this place of three daies. This article hath
two principall poynts to be conÅ¿idered in it:
firÅ¿t, the reÅ¿urrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> it Å¿elf of ChriÅ¿t, Å¿econd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the benefites y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> come vnto vs by it, which
are three in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ber. FirÅ¿t, life &amp; righteouÅ¿nes
is reÅ¿tored vnto vs by his riÅ¿ing: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
&amp; newnes of life here amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g men, is
taught vnto vs by this reÅ¿urrection: laÅ¿tly,
we are aÅ¿Å¿ured &amp; perÅ¿waded of our reÅ¿urrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.
In that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ChriÅ¿t our head is riÅ¿en again,
we alÅ¿o the members Å¿hall riÅ¿e with him, as
Paul Å¿aith, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿oeuer ChriÅ¿t which is our
head Å¿hal appeare, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Å¿hal we alÅ¿o appeare,
that is, riÅ¿e with him in glorie,</hi> (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is) <hi>a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
body as his is.</hi> Phil. 3. ColoÅ¿. 3. This
can not be but great comfort vnto vs. As co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his reÅ¿urrection, partly Å¿ome thing
was alledged before, &amp; teÅ¿timonies brought
<pb facs="tcp:10917:55"/>
to confirme it, but this may be Å¿aide more of
it, that it is Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿arie to be beleeued vnto
Å¿aluation, that without it no life can be had:
for how can he haue life, that doth not, or wil
not beleeue the author &amp; giuer of life, IeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t, to be aliue &amp; riÅ¿en, but dead? how (I
Å¿ay) ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Å¿uch an one haue any life in him at al?
Therefore our Sauiour, willing to leaue a
perpetuall memorie of this article to his
Church, Å¿eeing it was of Å¿uch great waight
&amp; importance, after that he had Å¿uffered, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented
him Å¿elfe aliue to his ApoÅ¿tles &amp; diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
&amp; to the women alÅ¿o, by many infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
tokens, being Å¿eene of them by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿pace
of fourtie dayes, &amp; Å¿peaking of thoÅ¿e things
which appertayne to the kingdome of God.
To this ende, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>firme &amp; Å¿treng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in this true reÅ¿urrection, he did eate
&amp; drinke w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them after he roÅ¿e, Acts. 10. Å¿he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> his hands &amp; his feete, bid them han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
him, &amp; Å¿ee that it was euen he and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Luk. 24. 39. Yea this point is Å¿o neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿arie
to obteyne euerlaÅ¿ting Å¿aluation, that
the ApoÅ¿tle S. Paul doth affirme, <hi>that if
ChriÅ¿t be not riÅ¿en againe, then is our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
in vayne, then is our faith in vayne,
then are we falÅ¿e witneÅ¿Å¿es of God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> are

                     <pb facs="tcp:10917:56"/>
aÅ¿leepe <hi>in ChriÅ¿t are periÅ¿hed, and we of al
men are moÅ¿t miÅ¿erable.</hi> All theÅ¿e abÅ¿urdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and inconueniences do follow, if we or
any other beleeue not Å¿tedfaÅ¿tly, that ChriÅ¿t
is riÅ¿en againe. But (dearly beloued) ChriÅ¿t
is riÅ¿en againe, as the Angel Å¿aid to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 6.</note>
                     <hi>He is riÅ¿en, he is not here,</hi> when they
thought hee had not bene riÅ¿en, but there in
the graue as hee was layde. The PhariÅ¿ees
thought, that if they could perÅ¿wade the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from the beliefe of this his reÅ¿urrection,
they Å¿hould do well ynough with them, and
therfore they gaue large money to the Å¿oul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
to Å¿ay that he was Å¿tollen away by his
diÅ¿ciples by night. They wel knew that if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
people of the Iewes did beleeue this his ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the dead, they would eaÅ¿ely beleeue
all other myÅ¿teries of his death and paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion,
with the articles going before. The
EuangeliÅ¿ts al of them do inculcate &amp; make
mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of no one article Å¿o much as of this:
for although <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> doe make no

they make diligent rehearÅ¿all
of this reÅ¿urrection in their GoÅ¿pels, <hi>Marke</hi>
16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. The ApoÅ¿tles after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion
of ChriÅ¿t, did eÅ¿pecially preach this article to

<pb facs="tcp:10917:56"/>
Peter in fiue Sermons together, the 1. 2.
3. 4. 5. of the Actes of the ApoÅ¿tles, maketh
eÅ¿peciall mention of this reÅ¿urrection. So
doth he in the Actes 10. And Å¿o doth Paul.
Act. 13. and 17. and in euery EpiÅ¿tle of his.
For in deede our whole faith dependeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, which if it be once ouerthrowen, then
can not our faith be Å¿ure &amp; Å¿table. Although
the ApoÅ¿tles were choÅ¿en to be witneÅ¿Å¿es of
all the doings and actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s of ChriÅ¿t, Act. 10.
verÅ¿e. 39. yet were they eÅ¿peciall witneÅ¿Å¿es
of his reÅ¿urrection, becauÅ¿e it Å¿eemed Å¿o
incredible in the eyes of all men. For when
as Peter made his Sermon immediatly
after ChriÅ¿tes aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion into heauen, in an
vpper chamber in IeruÅ¿alem, to all the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and to the women which were there.
which were in all, both men and women,
Å¿ixe Å¿core, hee made mention of this to the
reÅ¿t, that there muÅ¿t one be choÅ¿en into the
roume and place of Iudas the traytour, to
be made a witnes of ChriÅ¿tes reÅ¿urrection,
Act. 1. verÅ¿. 22. So that, although not only,
yet eÅ¿pecially the office of the ApoÅ¿tles
was, to declare and teÅ¿tifie with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and boldnes, the reÅ¿urrection of
ChriÅ¿t, to the people and Church of God.
Belike then, this reÅ¿urrection of ChriÅ¿t
<pb facs="tcp:10917:57"/>
doeth conteyne in it Å¿ome notable myÅ¿terie,
and leÅ¿Å¿on for our inÅ¿truction: and Å¿urely
Å¿o it doeth. Seeing it is Å¿o, let vs come to
the Å¿econde poynt which I noted, that was,
the benefite and great profite wee reape by
his reÅ¿urrection. This reÅ¿urrection was
great loÅ¿Å¿e vnto Satan, but the Å¿ame was
our gayne. For by it, death is Å¿wallowed
vp into victorie, and the bonds of the deuill,
whereby hee helde vs captiues at his will,
are all broken and daÅ¿hed in pieces, by this
victorious Lion of the tribe of Iuda. And
this is the firÅ¿t benefite, that eternall life,
which is y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> free gift of God, Rom. 6. is now
giuen vnto vs. Then before this reÅ¿urrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we were in the Å¿hadow of death, Å¿itting
in blindneÅ¿Å¿e and ignorance. Nowe ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e
is reÅ¿tored: then Å¿urely before, we
were in our Å¿innes, as Paul Å¿aith, <hi>If ChriÅ¿t
bee not ryÅ¿en, then are you as yet in your
Å¿innes, 1. Cor.</hi> 25. Well, nowe that he is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿en,
all our Å¿innes, are put away. Let vs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
this doctrine to our Å¿elues, for our owne
conÅ¿olation and comfort, agaynÅ¿t Satan
and all his tentations, and let vs Å¿ay of it as
Paul did, Galat. 2. <hi>I am crucified with
ChriÅ¿t, but I liue,</hi> (meaning by his reÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection)
<hi>yet not I any more, but ChriÅ¿t li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb facs="tcp:10917:57"/>
in me. And in that that I nowe liue in
the fleÅ¿h, I liue by the fayth in the Sonne
of God, who hath loued me, and giuen
him Å¿elfe for me.</hi> So muÅ¿t euery one of vs
Å¿ay, ChriÅ¿t hath ryÅ¿en againe for me, &amp; iuÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
me, and Å¿aued me, in reÅ¿toring life vnto
my dead body againe. Here ariÅ¿eth likewiÅ¿e
out of this, our duetie and thankefulneÅ¿Å¿e to
our Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t for this great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
not to forget it at any time, but as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es
Å¿ayeth, Deut. 6. 6. Å¿o muÅ¿t wee doe: for
this is the precept and commaundement of
the eternall God, <hi>TheÅ¿e wordes</hi> or things
<hi>which I command thee this day, Å¿hall be
in thy heart, and thou Å¿halt rehearÅ¿e them
continually vnto thy children, and Å¿halt
talke of them when thou Å¿itteÅ¿t in thy
houÅ¿e, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> thou walkeÅ¿t by the way,
and when thou lyeÅ¿t downe, and as thou
ryÅ¿eÅ¿t vp.</hi> So theÅ¿e benefites of ChriÅ¿t are
alwayes to be remembred. Alas, dearely
beloued brethren, if we woulde Å¿o thanke
and remember a friende of ours but a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
man, as we woulde neuer forget him,
but Å¿peake continually of him, and prayÅ¿e
him to others, if hee Å¿houlde beÅ¿towe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs a tranÅ¿itorie and temporall gift, which
laÅ¿teth but for a time, as a thouÅ¿ande pound
<pb facs="tcp:10917:58"/>
in money or goods, or an hundred pounde
lande a yeere, if (I Å¿ay) we would thinke
this very much, and great loue: what Å¿hall
wee thinke of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and howe
Å¿hall wee bee able to thanke him Å¿ufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and remember him ynough, which
hath beÅ¿towed vpon vs his owne goodes
and treaÅ¿ures, farre better then Å¿iluer and
golde, and all precious Å¿tones, yea, to the
which theÅ¿e things are but doung? and not
onely hath he giuen vnto vs his goods and
iewels:but he hath alÅ¿o giuen vnto vs moÅ¿t
faire and large poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions, euen the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, immortall,
vndeÅ¿tled, and which withereth not away,
as theÅ¿e inheritances here belowe doe.
TheÅ¿e things come vnto vs by his reÅ¿urrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and yet who almoÅ¿t of the hundred
part of men remembreth theÅ¿e benefits, and
receiueth them with thankeÅ¿giuing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly?
Nay, who thinketh not more of his
lands and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions here belowe, then of
thoÅ¿e aboue? Wel, they are the more fooles
and mad men, and altogether vnthankefull
to our good and louing Sauiour IeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t, which doeth offer theÅ¿e things vnto
them, if they woulde receiue them. God
make them and vs al, one day thankefull for
<pb facs="tcp:10917:58"/>
them. Well, to conclude this point, let vs
marke and beholde, that he is riÅ¿en againe
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> death, wherin did appeare greater force
and power, then if he had at that time come
downe from the croÅ¿Å¿e, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the Iewes wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him Å¿o to doe: for he did Å¿o vanquiÅ¿h and
ouercome death, Å¿triuing with him in the
graue, that hee was not able with all his
force, to keepe him vnder his rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.
If hee had bene ouercome, he
Å¿hould not haue Å¿aued vs. For it had bene al
one with vs, as with one ready to bee drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and Å¿ome other man to help and Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
him, woulde couragiouÅ¿ly leape into
the water, who in the ende Å¿hould be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him Å¿elfe, before he could releeue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
what help then could come to the man
that firÅ¿t fell into the water? Truely no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing could enÅ¿ue of this, but one euill
to folowe an other, and the death of the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
man, to be added to the loÅ¿Å¿e of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firÅ¿t.
But this was farre otherwiÅ¿e in ChriÅ¿t,
who firÅ¿t deliuered him Å¿elfe from the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of death and hell, that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
perÅ¿wade vs of our Å¿aluation, as a Å¿ure
anker, by faith in him alone. The Å¿econd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
that commeth to vs by ChriÅ¿ts reÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
is newnes of life, &amp; that we Å¿hould
<pb facs="tcp:10917:59"/>
mortifie our former: luÅ¿tes, in dying vnto
Å¿inne, and haue a newe life in all righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e
and holineÅ¿Å¿e, as we Å¿ee ChriÅ¿t did riÅ¿e
againe with a glorified body, not Å¿ubiect to
the like affections and paÅ¿Å¿ions as he was
before, to hunger and thirÅ¿t, to mortalitie
and other miÅ¿eries of the body, but had all
things as it were newe: Å¿o Å¿houlde we alÅ¿o
ryÅ¿e with him from this olde life of Å¿inne,
wherein wee haue liued too long, and put
on a newe and a better life, that is, as Paul
Å¿peaketh, <hi>to caÅ¿t off concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿ation
in time paÅ¿t, that olde man
which is corrupted through the deceyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
luÅ¿tes: and that we Å¿hould be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Å¿pirite of our minde, to put on
the newe man, which after God is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto ryghteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e.</hi>
This is the true image wherein
ChriÅ¿t is ryÅ¿en, and wherein we muÅ¿t alÅ¿o
ryÅ¿e: For Å¿urely (dearely beloued) as ChriÅ¿t
was rayÅ¿ed from the dead to the glory of the
Father, Å¿o we alÅ¿o Å¿houlde walke in newe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e
of life, Rom. 6. Then all they that doe
not leade a newe life and a ChriÅ¿tian, haue
not yet riÅ¿en with ChriÅ¿t, neither haue they
part of his reÅ¿urrection. For we muÅ¿t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider,
that the Å¿criptures of God do Å¿et forth
<pb facs="tcp:10917:59"/>
vnto vs two reÅ¿urrections: the one is of the
body at the generall daye of iudgement,
1. Corin. 15. Of this we Å¿hall heare more in
that article of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reÅ¿urrection, &amp; this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all, and is in the life to come, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Å¿econde reÅ¿urrection, where of Iohn
Å¿peaketh, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 20. The other reÅ¿urrection
is of the Å¿oule from Å¿inne, here in this life
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> elect and childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of God, which
are true members of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and
folowe him their head, and this is called the
firÅ¿t reÅ¿urrection, becauÅ¿e it goeth before
the other: and he that will haue his part of
the Å¿econde reÅ¿urrection to life euerlaÅ¿ting,
and not be hurt of the Å¿econde death, muÅ¿t
while he liueth here, indeuour to ryÅ¿e from
Å¿inne. Of this reÅ¿urrection Saint Iohn in
the twentie of the Reuelation Å¿pake moÅ¿t
playnely, Å¿aying, <hi>BleÅ¿Å¿ed and holy is hee
that hath his part in the firÅ¿t reÅ¿urrection,
for on Å¿uch the Å¿econd death hath no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
but they Å¿hall be the PrieÅ¿tes of God
and of ChriÅ¿t, and reygne with him a
thouÅ¿and yeeres:</hi> that is to Å¿ay, not a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ande
onely, but for euer and euer, as
is moÅ¿t clearely in another place of the
Å¿ame <hi>Iohn</hi> expounded, <hi>Chapter 22. verÅ¿e</hi>
5. in theÅ¿e wordes, <hi>The Lorde Å¿hall giue
<pb facs="tcp:10917:60"/>
them lyght, and they Å¿hall reigne for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore:</hi>
Which by the way maketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynÅ¿t
the error of them, that imagined
that ChriÅ¿t Å¿houlde reigne but a thouÅ¿ande
yeere with his elect, and that vpon the earth
alÅ¿o. But to come to our matter againe,
from the which wee haue a litle digreÅ¿Å¿ed:
We Å¿ee that there is alÅ¿o a reÅ¿urrection to
be Å¿ought for here in this life, from Å¿inne.
Of this reÅ¿urrection Å¿pake S. Paul alÅ¿o
EpheÅ¿. 5. Å¿peaking to them that where fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
downe &amp; aÅ¿leepe, or rather dead in Å¿inne:
<hi>Awake thou that Å¿leepeÅ¿t, and Å¿tande vp
from the dead, and ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall giue thee
light.</hi> In this reÅ¿urrection from Å¿inne and
wickednes did <hi>Dauid</hi> ariÅ¿e, when hee had
Å¿lept, and was almoÅ¿t dead in adulterie, and
murder of <hi>Vrias,</hi> for the Å¿pace of one whole
yere and more: for when <hi>Nathan</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
came vnto him, and Å¿harply rebuked
him for it, he repented and amended, and Å¿o
roÅ¿e againe to a lewe life afterwarde. So
did Saint Peter alÅ¿o riÅ¿e in this reÅ¿urrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when he had moÅ¿t wickedly and Å¿hame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
denied &amp; forÅ¿worÅ¿te his maÅ¿ter ChriÅ¿t:
for he went forth and wept bitterly: So he
roÅ¿e againe, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. And Å¿o doe all the
godly:when they haue Å¿inned, they are Å¿ory
<pb facs="tcp:10917:60"/>
for it, and by and by they ariÅ¿e by repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tance,
and neuer intende to doe the like againe.
And verely Å¿o muÅ¿t we all doe, euery one of
vs from the hieÅ¿t to the loweÅ¿t, none muÅ¿t be
exempted, if we wil be ChriÅ¿ts Å¿cholers and
diÅ¿ciples, or haue any part with him in his
holy reÅ¿urrection. When we haue offended
our maÅ¿ter ChriÅ¿t, let vs be moÅ¿t heartily Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
for it, lament and amendc, and Å¿erue him
better afterwarde, taking heede of the like
offences againe: then Å¿hall wee haue our
part in this reÅ¿urrection, &amp; Å¿o be bleÅ¿Å¿ed for
euer. Nowe the wicked and reprobate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e,
when they haue Å¿inned, they can not
ryÅ¿e agayne by repentance with <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Dauid,</hi> but rather lye Å¿till vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of their Å¿innes, and Å¿o fall to deÅ¿payre:
therefore they can haue no fellowÅ¿hippe in
this reÅ¿urrection. As for example, wee Å¿ee
in <hi>Cain,</hi> haw he diÅ¿payred when he had Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 14.</note>
and neuer repented or amended his
life, Gene. 4. So did <hi>Saul:</hi> and Å¿o did king
Pharao confeÅ¿Å¿e he had Å¿inned vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord:
but yet he hardened his heart,<note place="margin">Exod. 8.8 and 9. 28.</note> and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Å¿till in his Å¿innes to prouoke the Lorde,
for he would not let IÅ¿rael goe to Å¿erue the
Lorde, who did not ryÅ¿e in this reÅ¿urrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The like we haue of EÅ¿au,<note place="margin">Gen. 27.38.</note> who wept in
<pb facs="tcp:10917:61"/>
deede, but not in <hi>godly Å¿orow that cauÅ¿eth
repentance vnto Å¿aluation, not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of,</hi> as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ApoÅ¿tle Å¿peaketh of, 2. Cor.
7. But he lamented in <hi>worldly Å¿orowe,</hi> that
<hi>cauÅ¿eth death,</hi> becauÅ¿e he amended not his
Å¿infull life, Hebrew. 12. The like may bee
Å¿ayde of Iudas, who fell as others of the
godly dyd into Å¿inne, but roÅ¿e not agayne
with them. Therefore the reprobate, when
they fall away, can not ryÅ¿e, becauÅ¿e they
can not bee renewed by repentance, Å¿eeing
they crucifie to them Å¿elues the Sonne of
God, and make a mocke of him, as Iulian
that wicked Emperour &amp; runnagate from
ChriÅ¿t, after he fell away from him, neuer
came to him againe. For it was vnpoÅ¿Å¿ible
for him Å¿o to doe, as Paul Å¿ayeth, Hebr. 6.
verÅ¿e 4, 5, 6. But here let vs behold the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿e
dealing of man, and the vanitie of his
heart, when he Å¿houlde be riÅ¿en with ChriÅ¿t
in his reÅ¿urrection, he riÅ¿eth with the deuil
to the toppe of all Å¿inne and wickedneÅ¿Å¿e:
when he Å¿hould be aliue in al good workes,
he is dead in them, and quicke in all abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations:
many riÅ¿e, but not with ChriÅ¿t to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
glory of God, but to their owne glory, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the worlde: Å¿ome to promotions &amp; prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts
by vniuÅ¿t and vnlawful meanes, Å¿ome
<pb facs="tcp:10917:61"/>
to pride and ambition, Å¿ome riÅ¿e early,
as EÅ¿ay, 5. Chapter Å¿ayeth, <hi>But to followe
drunkenneÅ¿Å¿e, and to practiÅ¿e their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
deuiÅ¿es, which they haue conceiued
in their beddes.</hi> Thus they riÅ¿e and haue a
reÅ¿urrection, but not in goodneÅ¿Å¿e, but in
moÅ¿t filthie and abominable Å¿inne. For
where we Å¿houlde be freÅ¿h and floriÅ¿hing as
good and greene trees, to bring forth good
fruite, left we be throwne downe and caÅ¿t
into the fire: we are dead &amp; withered, &amp; drie
in al goodnes, corrupt trees without fruite,
twiÅ¿e dead and plucked vp by the rootes.
This is a very miÅ¿erable thing, but yet
common to many. Wee Å¿ee then by theÅ¿e
things, that the wicked liue in the thinges
wherein they Å¿hould dye, and die in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things
wherein they Å¿hould be aliue before God, as
faith, hope, and loue of God, and heauen and
heauenly things: Å¿o that we may iudge, that
as yet they haue not atteyned to this reÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
which ChriÅ¿t hath gotten and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for vs by his riÅ¿ing again. Wel, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this leÅ¿Å¿on, <hi>let vs that are riÅ¿en with
ChriÅ¿t, Å¿eeke thoÅ¿e thinges that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue,
where ChriÅ¿t Å¿itteth at the right hand
of God, and let vs Å¿et our affections vpon
heauenly thinges, and not earthly, for wee
<pb facs="tcp:10917:62"/>
are dead, and our life is hidde with
ChriÅ¿t in God,</hi> ColoÅ¿Å¿ians 3. verÅ¿. 1. and Å¿o
let vs altogether mortifie our earthly mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and fleÅ¿hly luÅ¿tes, fornication, euil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiÅ¿ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce,
vncleannes, inordinate affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
and couetouÅ¿nes, which is of all vices the
worÅ¿t, &amp; called Idolatrie: doing theÅ¿e things
in the firÅ¿t reÅ¿urrection, when ChriÅ¿t which
is our life Å¿hal appeare, then Å¿hall we alÅ¿o in
the Å¿econde reÅ¿urrection appeare with him
in glory. The which aÅ¿Å¿urance of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urrection
is the thirde benefite, we haue to
note in this reÅ¿urrection of ChriÅ¿t: for by it
we are made Å¿urc and certaine of the ryÅ¿ing
againe of our bodies at the laÅ¿t and generall
day of iudgement, when ChriÅ¿t Å¿hal come to
iudge all the worlde in righteouÅ¿nes. I Å¿ay,
that his riÅ¿ing is the earneÅ¿t of our immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie,
not onely in our Å¿oules, but alÅ¿o in
our bodyes.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>He is become the firÅ¿t fruits of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that Å¿leepe: and as in Adam we al die:
Å¿o again by ChriÅ¿t and his reÅ¿urrection, we
Å¿hal al be made aliue at the great and laÅ¿t
day,</hi> in as much as <hi>he is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reÅ¿urrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> &amp; the
life, and he that beleeueth in him, although
he were dead, yet Å¿hal hee liue,</hi> Iohn 11.
And hee is the head that is riÅ¿en, therefore
the body and all the members of the Å¿ame
<pb facs="tcp:10917:62"/>
Å¿hal followe in due time. For as when a man
hath fallen into Å¿ome deepe and dangerous
riuer, and hath nowe recouered his head
from vnder the water, and Å¿wimmeth aboue
out of danger with his head, although his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts &amp; members of his body be not yet
Å¿eene &amp; diÅ¿couered, yet wil al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Å¿ay, he is eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
from death already: Å¿o is it with our
head IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and with vs his body.
Seeing he is eÅ¿caped and tiÅ¿e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deepe
gulfe of death, (notwithÅ¿tanding wee Å¿eeme
as yet to be couered therein in this our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Å¿tate) why may it not be iuÅ¿tly Å¿aide, that
we are riÅ¿en with him, being Å¿o neerely ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and vnited vnto him, vnleÅ¿Å¿e we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
him to bee our head? Wherefore, if wee
profeÅ¿Å¿e our Å¿elues to be his, wee muÅ¿t lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e
acknowledge that our reÅ¿urrection is
already begun in his, &amp; that we do by hope,
(which neuer maketh aÅ¿hamed) in this life
retaine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aÅ¿Å¿urance of that Å¿tate, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
wee Å¿hall with ful poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion &amp; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliÅ¿hme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t
in heauen with him enioy for euer.
This can not bee but a great and Å¿ingular
comfort to al the faithfull Å¿eruauntes of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us
ChriÅ¿t, to conÅ¿ider that their bodyes Å¿hal
not lie for euer in the graues, as the bodyes
of beaÅ¿tes do, but that they Å¿hall riÅ¿e againe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:63"/>
with ChriÅ¿t, which is before entred into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
to prepare a place there for vs, that hee
may come againe at the laÅ¿t day to receiue
vs wholy vnto him Å¿elfe. If wee were by
the death of any friende of ours, made Å¿ure
by good and Å¿ufficient warrant of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounde lande a yeere, howe greatly
woulde wee reioyce thereof both night and
day! And how ought we to reioyce continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
beyng put in aÅ¿Å¿urance by ChriÅ¿tes
death and reÅ¿urrection, not of landes and
goodes here, which are but Å¿hort and tranÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie:
but of the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the euerlaÅ¿ting
and immortall kingdome of God, where
are pleaÅ¿ures without ende, and ioyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any wearineÅ¿Å¿e. O howe ought this to
Å¿tirre vs vp to be in loue with that life, but
eÅ¿pecially and aboue all things to loue him,
that was the authour and purchaÅ¿er of theÅ¿e
things vnto vs, euen IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t the Å¿onne
of God, both God and man! I woulde to
God we did thinke of theÅ¿e thinges and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider
deepely with our Å¿elues, what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for vs by his reÅ¿urrection: Å¿urely then
wee woulde not Å¿inne, at the leaÅ¿t we would
not wallo we with the Å¿owe, and delite in our
Å¿innes as many men do, the more is the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Wel, this is the greateÅ¿t benefite we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
<pb facs="tcp:10917:63"/>
by this reÅ¿urrection, euen our owne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing:

this grace and happineÅ¿Å¿e, their life were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
miÅ¿erable, &amp; they Å¿urely would deÅ¿paire.
But of theÅ¿e things which are very incident

(by Gods grace) Å¿hal be Å¿poke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> we come

humble and heartie thankes, for the benefits
that we receiue of his gratious goodnes, by
his victorious reÅ¿urrection, in that hee hath
gotten to vs life, and opened the gates of
paradiÅ¿e vnto vs, which were Å¿hutte before.
And with all, becauÅ¿e we neede continually
to craue many thinges at his handes, let vs
meekely pray vnto him, that hee woulde
vouchÅ¿afe to woorke Å¿o in our harde heartes

<hi>God is gone vp with triumph, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the

in this aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion of ChriÅ¿t, for the

We Å¿ee then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in the mouth of two or three
witneÅ¿Å¿es, this matter is proued vnto vs, &amp;
ought therfore to be beleeued of vs, &amp; fully
eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed. But becauÅ¿e no man doth (as I

is it in controuerÅ¿ie betweene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> PapiÅ¿ts &amp;
vs, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cerning his aÅ¿cenÅ¿io<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> (although in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

come to the Å¿econd point, which is to

and remaineth in heauen, and to what

To Å¿it at Gods right hande,<note place="margin">What it is to Å¿it at Gods right hand.</note> is to haue, and
to be aboue <hi>all rule, power, might and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
&amp; euery name that is named, not
onely in this world, but alÅ¿o in the worlde
to come, Ephe.</hi> 1. It is then as our Å¿auiour
ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. and 28. <hi>To haue all
things giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vnto him, al authoritie, both in
heauen and in earth.</hi> For the right hand of
God, Å¿ignifieth the euerlaÅ¿ting and infinite
power of God. Wee muÅ¿t not thinke, that
God being an infinite &amp; moÅ¿t bleÅ¿Å¿ed Å¿pirit,<note place="margin">Iohn 1. 18. and 4. 24.</note>
and not a body, hath either right hand or
lefte, eyes or armes, or Å¿uch like partes and
members of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s body:but when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
giueth theÅ¿e properties &amp; Å¿peaches vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, (as it doth often) it is for our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and capacitie, which are children and
babes in Gods matters, &amp; therfore can not
vnderÅ¿tand him in his maieÅ¿tie Å¿peaking to
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, vnles he liÅ¿pe (as it were) vnto vs, like a
nurce vnto her young children. For we are
Å¿o groÅ¿Å¿e, that we vnderÅ¿ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d not how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Lord is angry with ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> for his Å¿inne
&amp; wickednes, vnles he Å¿peake after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner
of men, &amp; Å¿ay, he repenteth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer he made
<pb facs="tcp:10917:66"/>
man. Againe we vnderÅ¿ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d not, or conceiue
his wonderfull power and Å¿trength, except
it be by a great and mighty and Å¿tretched
out arme or hande. So by the eyes of the
Lord is meant his carefull &amp; vigilant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
&amp; foreÅ¿ight ouer all his creatures,
and by his countenance is moÅ¿t commonly
meant his terrible wrath and anger. When
the Å¿cripture giueth an eare to God, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
the preachers Å¿aye in their Sermons, that
he hath an eare: you muÅ¿t vnderÅ¿tand that
he heareth all things bee they neuer Å¿o Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
Å¿poken of any man, as by his eye, hee
Å¿eeth al things in this world, although they
be neuer Å¿o much hid, and done in darke &amp;
Å¿ecret places, as the wicked doe their euill
workes. As we Å¿ee then that kings and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men do place at their right hande, Å¿uch
as are either their betters, or equals, or doe
gouerne in their Å¿teade, Å¿o is it here: ChriÅ¿t
is exalted and placed in that dignitie &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that his father is, becauÅ¿e he is equall
vnto him. And this latter part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> article,
to <hi>Å¿it at Gods right hand,</hi> being in the laÅ¿t
chapter of <hi>Marke,</hi> from whence it Å¿eemeth
this was taken, <hi>S. Paul</hi> doth expounde very
well in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 1. <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> that <hi>God hath Å¿et him
farre aboue all principalitie and power, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:10917:67"/>
might and domination.</hi> And in an other
place, <hi>Philip. 2. hath highly exalted him,
and giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> him a name aboue euery name,
that at the name of IeÅ¿us Å¿houlde euery
knee bowe, both of things in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, and
things in earth, &amp; things vnder the earth,
and that euery tongue Å¿houlde confeÅ¿Å¿e
that IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is the Lorde, vnto the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God the father.</hi> This is the meaning
of theÅ¿e words, <hi>he Å¿itteth at the right hand
of God.</hi> It is not of any corporall Å¿itting,
for it may as wel be Å¿ayd, <hi>that he Å¿ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>deth at
the right hand of God:</hi> For Å¿o did <hi>Saint
Stephen</hi> Å¿ee him, <hi>Actes</hi> 7. Therefore both
by Å¿itting and Å¿tanding there, is meant, that
he is aduaunced to great glorie, as hath
bene Å¿ayde already. And here in this his
aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion, Å¿o glorious is his kingdome to
be Å¿eene, which hee did not take vpon him
here in the earth. So that although ChriÅ¿t
did Å¿hewe great glorie in his reÅ¿urrection,
all mortalitie being layde away, yet by his
aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion into heauen, hee hath more nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
declared his power: for now he gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
all things, and ruleth as a king ouer
all the earth. And this doeth the ApoÅ¿tle
teache vs, that <hi>he aÅ¿cended farre aboue all
heauens, to fulfill all things.</hi> For we Å¿ee, and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:67"/>
reade how aboundantly, and moÅ¿t miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louÅ¿ly
he powred downe his holy Å¿pirit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
his ApoÅ¿tles, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. howe he hath increaÅ¿ed
his church and kingdome in euery part of
the earth, how he hath euer Å¿ince his aÅ¿cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion,
mightily defended his, &amp; Å¿harply pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hed
his enemies. So that although he be
in heauen according to his bodily preÅ¿ence,
and not in earth (as the <hi>Lutheranes</hi> &amp; <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piÅ¿tes</hi>
do imagine him to be in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
contrary to this article, <hi>he aÅ¿cended,</hi>
which is to be meant only of his body, &amp; not
of his diuine nature, which doeth fill all
things, &amp; needeth not to deÅ¿cend or aÅ¿cend:)
yet (I Å¿ay) ChriÅ¿t is with vs, as hee him Å¿elfe
Å¿aith, <hi>euen vnto the end of the world, Mat.</hi>
28. 19. by his power &amp; Å¿pirit, &amp; by his grace
and godhead, which is euery where. For
he Å¿ayeth, that <hi>he will not leaue vs father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
but will come vnto vs:</hi> which he meant
by Å¿ending his Å¿pirit, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. We are not
then to looke for ChriÅ¿tes body here nowe
vpon the earth, (as certaine heretikes do
Å¿uppoÅ¿e) euen as he him Å¿elfe Å¿aith, <hi>Matt.
26. Me Å¿hal you not haue alwayes.</hi> Surely
this Å¿aying can by no meanes be true, if his
body be euery where, in euery place, at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Å¿acrament: then is not his body departed
<pb facs="tcp:10917:68"/>
from vs, then is he not aÅ¿cended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
but remaineth here Å¿till in the earth.
But the Angell Å¿ayde to the women, <hi>that
he was not there.</hi> That was Å¿ome place, &amp;
then he had a glorified body. And it is Å¿aid,
that <hi>heauen muÅ¿t conteine him, vntill all
things bee reÅ¿tored, Act.</hi> 3. Surely being
now aÅ¿cended in body, we neither reade of,
nor beleeue any other deÅ¿cenÅ¿ion in body,
then that wherein he Å¿hall deÅ¿ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>de to iudge
at the latter day: as the Angels Å¿pake to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
diÅ¿ciples, <hi>This IeÅ¿us which is taken vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
you into heauen, Å¿hall Å¿o come, as ye haue
Å¿eene him go into heauen.</hi> So that vnles
we Å¿ee ChriÅ¿t Å¿o come down as he went vp,
we will not beleeue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papiÅ¿tes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Å¿ay he is
in the boxe or pixe, much leÅ¿Å¿e them that Å¿ay,
he is euery where, making him in deede to
haue no body at all, but altogether Å¿wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
vp by his diuinitie. For tell mee, I
pray you, if ChriÅ¿t had mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t his body Å¿hould
alway remaine here vpon the earth, why
did he Å¿ay that he muÅ¿t depart from them?
They cannot meane it of his diuinity, but of
his humanitie. Againe, what needed his diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to bee Å¿o Å¿orowefull for his going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
if they had had his body with them?
Here they anÅ¿were, The diÅ¿ciples had not
<pb facs="tcp:10917:68"/>
his body viÅ¿ibly, but his body inuiÅ¿ible or
not Å¿eene. But Å¿urely the diÅ¿ciples, if they
had vnderÅ¿toode it Å¿o, as the PapiÅ¿tes Å¿ay,
of his inuiÅ¿ible body, they were not Å¿uch
children, but that they would haue conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them Å¿elues, as well with his inuiÅ¿ible
body, as his inuiÅ¿ible Å¿pirit, and grace after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes:
therfore they would needes know
howe they Å¿hould be comforted when hee
was gone from them. ChriÅ¿t told them, by
his Å¿pirite, although inuiÅ¿ible, and not by
his body inuiÅ¿ible, which Å¿urely would haue
comforted them, although they Å¿aw it not,
if it had then bene with them, as his Å¿pirite
was: but ChriÅ¿t meant no Å¿uch thing, and
therefore promiÅ¿ed euer his Å¿pirit to them,
and all others after, and not his inuiÅ¿ible
body. This is a plaine caÅ¿e, but I leaue to
diÅ¿courÅ¿e of it any further, becauÅ¿e I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
in this booke to edifie and inÅ¿truct the
Å¿imple readers, onely in the poyntes of
ChriÅ¿tianitie, concerning their faith, and
not to make any treatiÅ¿e for the learned.
Seeing then wee haue a great hie PrieÅ¿t,
which is entred into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, euen IeÅ¿us the
Å¿onne of God, let vs hold faÅ¿t our profeÅ¿Å¿io<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
as the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿ayth, and let vs goe boldly
vnto the throne of grace, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
<pb facs="tcp:10917:69"/>
mercie, and finde grace to helpe
in time of neede. For this was the third
point, that I Å¿ayde was to be obÅ¿erued of
vs, to weigh with our Å¿elues, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and commodity thereby doeth enÅ¿ue
to all the faythfull, that hee is in heauen.
Surely, this cannot be but great comfort
to al the faithful: for they all are aÅ¿Å¿ured by
ChriÅ¿tes aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion, that they alÅ¿o Å¿hall one
day, euen at the reÅ¿urrection of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
aÅ¿cende with him: for he is gone to
prepare a place for them, as he teÅ¿tifieth in
<hi>Iohn. 14. I goe to prepare a place for you,
and if I goe to prepare a place for you, I
will come agayne, and receyue you vnto
my Å¿elfe, that where I am, there may ye
be alÅ¿o.</hi> ChriÅ¿t by his aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion hath ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the gates and doores of heauen, and
ParadiÅ¿e for vs, which were Å¿hut againÅ¿t
vs before, Å¿o that wee had no entrance
thither. For this is moÅ¿t certayne and
true, that if the head be there, then Å¿hall
the body and members be there alÅ¿o:
and if our captayne be there, then Å¿hall his
Å¿ouldiers, which are we, be one day with
him, and the maÅ¿ter will haue there his
Å¿eruantes to wayte and attend vpon him
in his houÅ¿e. And to be Å¿hort, Å¿eeing ChriÅ¿t
<pb facs="tcp:10917:69"/>
is in heauen, he wil haue his true ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to be with him. Is not this a great
comfort in all troubles, and hurlyburlies
in this life, to meditate vpon this, that one
day we Å¿hall come into the preÅ¿ence of our
louing MaÅ¿ter IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t? Surely this
would comfort any poore afflicted Å¿oule or
body, if he did remember it: but we forget
it, and then what ioy can wee haue in this
vale of miÅ¿erie? This comforted Dauid in
his baniÅ¿hment, Å¿aying, <hi>When Å¿hal I come
to appeare before the preÅ¿ence of God?</hi>
This reioyced Paul greatly, when he Å¿ayd,
<hi>A crowne of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e is layde vp
for me in that day, when the Lord Å¿hal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
2. Timothie</hi> 4. So then, this is the
firÅ¿t, and one of the greateÅ¿t benefites, that
by ChriÅ¿tes aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion, wee haue an aÅ¿Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of our owne. <hi>For when ChriÅ¿t
Å¿hall appeare, then Å¿hall we alÅ¿o appeare
with him in glory, ColoÅ¿sians</hi> 3. But
yet wee muÅ¿t remember, that as ChriÅ¿t
firÅ¿t Å¿uffered Å¿hame and reproche, and
bitter death alÅ¿o, and Å¿o in the ende
entred into heauen, by diuers croÅ¿Å¿es
and calamyties, Å¿o muÅ¿t wee alÅ¿o for
the moÅ¿t part, enter in the Å¿ame way
with him: for by many tribulations muÅ¿t
<pb facs="tcp:10917:70"/>
we enter into the kingdome of heauen, and
all that wil liue godly in IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, Å¿hal
Å¿uffer perÅ¿ecution. For you knowe that the
Å¿eruant muÅ¿t not looke to be better han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> his maÅ¿ter, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿choler, to be in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
caÅ¿e then his teacher, nor we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> ChriÅ¿t.
Againe, ChriÅ¿t by his aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion doth Å¿oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
al our Å¿utes, cauÅ¿es, matters &amp; iniuries,
which we Å¿uffer, to God his father. For hee
is our Atturney, &amp; pleadeth for vs, as Iohn
Å¿ayth, <hi>If any man Å¿inne, we haue an aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with the father, IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>
Is it not a great comfort to a poore
man, that can not make friendes, or come
vp to the prince, becauÅ¿e of coÅ¿ts and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
to haue alway one of the priuy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ell
to helpe and further his Å¿utes as readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and diligently, as if hee were there him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe?
So Å¿urely it is with vs: wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t at hand with God his
father, being of his moÅ¿t priuy and Å¿ecrete
counÅ¿ell, to make requeÅ¿tes to God for vs
continually, to pardon our Å¿innes, to grant
vs grace and all other thinges neceÅ¿Å¿ary.
This is Å¿ingular ioy to a godly heart, Å¿o y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
wee neede not to Å¿eeke any other Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
as the PapiÅ¿tes doe, as if hee were
not Å¿ufficient of him Å¿elfe, or as mercifull
<pb facs="tcp:10917:70"/>
to heare vs, as his mother, or Peter, or any
other Å¿aynt in heauen. This is their folly,
and madnes: let vs be contented with
our only Mediatour IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e
he is moÅ¿t able, and moÅ¿t willing to heare
vs, yea biddeth vs to come to him for our
cauÅ¿es, <hi>Matthewe 11. Come vnto me all
ye that trauell and are laden, and I will
refreÅ¿he you.</hi> Therefore we may boldly
and Å¿afely goe vnto him in our neede and
neceÅ¿Å¿itye, and feare not. Which of vs is it,
that if the prince did byd vs come at the
firÅ¿t to her, and not to any other of her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy
chamber, but would come moÅ¿t wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
and be glad Å¿o to do? Why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> come
wee not to God at the firÅ¿t, Å¿aying in
his worde. <hi>Cal vpon me, in the day of thy
trouble, and I will heare thee?</hi> Why come
wee not to ChriÅ¿t, that Å¿o louingly biddeth
euery one of vs? Wel, let vs holde this for
an vnfallible principle: ChriÅ¿t being aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
is our onely Å¿pokeÅ¿man, neither
let any man thinke, that it is with IeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t, the king of all kings, as it is with
princes of the earth, that becauÅ¿e he is Å¿o hie
and in Å¿o great dignitie and maieÅ¿tie, hee
doth not therefore regarde, or reÅ¿pect vs
here vpon the earth Å¿o lowe: nay, Dauid
<pb facs="tcp:10917:71"/>
telleth vs the contrary, and meeteth with
this obiection: for hee Å¿ayth, <hi>In deede the
Lorde is hie aboue al nations, and his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
aboue the heauens.</hi> But yet hee Å¿ayeth,
<hi>that he abaÅ¿eth himÅ¿elf to behold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things
in heauen and in earth: yea, he rayÅ¿eth the
needy out of the duÅ¿t, &amp; lifteth the poore
out of the dounghill, to Å¿et him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> princes,
PÅ¿al.</hi> 113. So we Å¿ee, although the Lord be
hye, yet he hath reÅ¿pect vnto the lowly. And
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, notwithÅ¿tanding he be in all
pleaÅ¿ure, &amp; bleÅ¿Å¿ednes, yet he thinketh vpon
vs, becauÅ¿e he hath Å¿ometyme felt y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> like mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eries
with vs: &amp; we haue Å¿uch an hie PrieÅ¿t,
that can be touched with our infirmities,
euen at this time alÅ¿o, as he Å¿ayde to Paul
perÅ¿ecuting his Å¿ayntes, <hi>Saul, Saul, why
doeÅ¿t thou perÅ¿ecute me?</hi> ChriÅ¿t counted
himÅ¿elfe then to be perÅ¿ecuted, although he
were in heauen, becauÅ¿e his poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
were afflicted, <hi>Actes.</hi> 9. In deede prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
here, and noble men with vs many
tymes knowe not the miÅ¿ery of others, nay
regarde it not, becauÅ¿e they haue neuer felt
the like Å¿mart, and knowe not what hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or thirÅ¿t, or nakednes, or impriÅ¿o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ment,
or baniÅ¿hme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, or lacke of lodging meaneth,
not hauing Å¿uffered the like themÅ¿elues.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:71"/>
But (I Å¿ay) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caÅ¿e is farre otherwiÅ¿e with
ChriÅ¿t, who knoweth better what we lack,
then we our Å¿elues doe, and hath borne the
like burden with vs, and doeth not forget
vs nowe in his glory and honor, as many
do their poore friends, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they are aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to any promotion &amp; dignitie by others.
Wherefore as IoÅ¿eph in all his rioltie and
glory, remembred &amp; did acknowledge his
poore brethren before Pharao, and all his
houÅ¿e: Å¿o doeth vndoubtedly our Sauiour
ChriÅ¿t thinke vpon vs, his poore brethren,
Å¿aying, <hi>I will declare thy name vnto my
brethren, and he wil not be aÅ¿hamed to
confeÅ¿Å¿e vs in heauen before his father,
and all his holy Angels.</hi> For howe Å¿hould
the head be aÅ¿hamed of his body, or the huÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of his wife? ChriÅ¿t is not aÅ¿hamed of
vs his Å¿pirituall kinred, as we are aÅ¿hamed
of our kindred many times, when we are
exalted aboue them: nay, hee is neuer aÅ¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of vs, vnleÅ¿Å¿e wee be firÅ¿t aÅ¿hamed
of him. For then in deede hee Å¿ayth, <hi>Hee
that is aÅ¿hamed of me and my Å¿ayings
here in earth before men, I wil alÅ¿o be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hamed
of him in heauen before my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and he that Å¿hal denye him here, hee
<pb facs="tcp:10917:72"/>
wil deny him there: but hee that Å¿hal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e
him here, he will confeÅ¿Å¿e him there.
Mar.</hi> 8. Furthermore we are to vnderÅ¿tand,
that although ChriÅ¿t by his aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion hath
taken away his body from the earth, which
was not neceÅ¿Å¿ary for vs, yet he hath left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Churche, and giuen vnto it, as a
moÅ¿t Å¿ure and firme pledge, and earneÅ¿t pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his good will towardes vs, his holy
Å¿pirit alway crying in our heartes, Father,
father, &amp; working in vs, that which is good
&amp; acceptable in his Å¿ight. This is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t
comfort that may be to the faythful in
this lyfe, and therefore is this Å¿pirit often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
called by our Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t, The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.
And this great and Å¿ingular benefit
we haue by his aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion: for he Å¿ayde, that
vnleÅ¿Å¿e hee went his way from them, the
comforter would not come, but if he went,
he would Å¿end him, as in deede he did after
his aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion moÅ¿t plentifully, and doeth
at this day vnto his giue his Å¿pirit, either
in greater or leÅ¿Å¿er meaÅ¿ure, to Å¿ome more,
to Å¿ome leÅ¿Å¿e, as hee thinketh good. This
benefite then doe wee enioy by his bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preÅ¿ence, departing for a time from vs.
This gift is to our Å¿oules, the fountayne of
life, and the very welÅ¿pring &amp; beginning

IeÅ¿us is in heauen, therefore let our hearts

as wee haue to learne by ChriÅ¿tes reÅ¿urrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a Å¿pirituall reÅ¿urrection here in this
life from Å¿inne: In like Å¿ort we learne alÅ¿o
by theÅ¿e wordes of Saint Paul, an holy
and Å¿pirituall aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion into heauen by our
deÅ¿ires and thoughts, that we may ioyne to
him euen nowe in fayth and Å¿pirite, till wee
all meete in body there at the faÅ¿t day. And
truely if we coulde keepe our mindes Å¿o aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
vp into heauen, it woulde be very
benificiall for vs, and ridde vs out of many
daungers. Wee Å¿ee and learne by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that the byrde is neuer inÅ¿nared and
caught of the fouler, vntill he lyght and Å¿it
vpon the earth: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he falleth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground,
then is hee Å¿ubiect to gunÅ¿hatte, or other

our mindes were fixed aboue, vpon heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, Satan coulde not take vs in his
<pb facs="tcp:10917:73"/>
trappes, but when they are altogether caÅ¿t
downewarde vpon the earth, and earthly
pleaÅ¿ures, then we fall into his baytes, and
are entangled in his grennes. Therefore
as ChriÅ¿t is aÅ¿cended, Å¿o let vs alÅ¿o aÅ¿cende
in minde &amp; cogitation vnto him: for ChriÅ¿t
doeth bidde vs tome vnto him, and this Å¿ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

then come and reÅ¿orte vnto him by our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿t

with him<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> For prayer is Å¿ayd to be a Å¿peach

Å¿houlde remember then, that as often as we
pray, we Å¿peake to the maieÅ¿tie of God, and

when we heare his worde preached vnto vs,

God Å¿peaketh vnto vs: and therefore giue

<hi>The angels, and powers, and myght are

<pb facs="tcp:10917:74"/>
So that wee may boldly Å¿aye as Dauid
Å¿ayde Å¿ometime, <hi>The Lorde is our Å¿hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde:
yea, the Lorde IeÅ¿us is our King,
therefore Å¿hall wee lacke nothing.</hi> For
tel me I pray you, what good thing can we
want, ChriÅ¿t being our heauenly King,
and hauing nowe all power and authoritie
giuen vnto him, and Å¿itting at the ryght
hand of the almightie Father? Surely his
Å¿eruantes Å¿hall enioy all things, as he Å¿ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
He that ouercommeth Å¿hall inherit all
things, and who is he that ouercommeth,
but IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, in whome we by his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and vertue ouercome alÅ¿o? that as
hee is made heyre of all things, Å¿o myght
wee alÅ¿o bee made ioynt heyres with him.
Wherefore wee knowe ChriÅ¿t no more in
his mortalitie, and humilitie. <hi>Yea although
wee had knowen ChriÅ¿t after the fleÅ¿h,
yet hence foorth knowe we him no more
after the fleÅ¿h, but after the woorking of
his myghtie Spirite, whereby hee is able
to Å¿ubdue all things to him Å¿elfe, Philip.</hi> 3.
For here we muÅ¿t conÅ¿ider, that ChriÅ¿t hath
thus aÅ¿cended into glorie for vs, and hath
receyued giftes for men, euen great Å¿poyles
of the enemies, to enrich his Church. This
is our reioycing which wee haue dayly in
<pb facs="tcp:10917:75"/>
ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us: here is the ioy, patience, and
victorie of the Saints of God, for he muÅ¿t
reigne, vntill hee hath put all his enemies
vnder his feete. Who then can he diÅ¿coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with any thing that befalleth vnto him,
eyther of bodie, or griefe of minde, or loÅ¿Å¿e
of goods and friends? Is it not ChriÅ¿t that
dyed for vs, and which is ryÅ¿en againe,
who is alÅ¿o at the ryght hande of God, and
maketh requeÅ¿t for vs? Who Å¿hall Å¿ay any
thing vnto our charge? who Å¿hal condemne
vs? If ChriÅ¿t be on our Å¿ide, as hee is moÅ¿t
certaynely, being our head, who then can
bee agaynÅ¿t vs? howe can wee Å¿acke any
thing in this lyfe, when God hath giuen
his Sonne for vs? What man or woman
woulde thinke to lacke any thing earthly,
that had a King to his Father, or a Prince
to bee his brother? and Å¿hall wee bee of
Å¿o litle fayth, to thinke that wee can lacke
ought, hauing GOD the great King
ouer al the world, to be our louing Father,
and IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t his Sonne, the Prince
of all princes to bee our owne brother?
This were madneÅ¿Å¿e to thinke or conceiue:
but yet if wee bee wauering through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulitie,
let vs Å¿aye and waye with the
man in the GoÅ¿pel, Lorde helpe my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe:
<pb facs="tcp:10917:75"/>
and with the ApoÅ¿tles let vs
Å¿aye, Lorde increaÅ¿e our fayth in vs, and
make it Å¿trong agaynÅ¿t all tentations of
Satan. Seeing then that IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t
is of that power, that he is able to bring
to paÅ¿Å¿e all thinges, Gods children may
aÅ¿Å¿ure them Å¿elues of a Å¿ingular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
agaynÅ¿t all their enemies. <hi>For who
Å¿hall Å¿eparate vs from the loue of ChriÅ¿t?
Shall tribulation, or anguiÅ¿h, or perÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
or famine, or nakedneÅ¿Å¿e, or
peryll, or Å¿worde? Nay (dearely beloued)
I am certaynely perÅ¿waded, that neither
death, nor life, nor angels, nor principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
nor powers, nor thinges preÅ¿ent,
nor thinges to come, nor heyght, nor
depth, nor any other creature Å¿hall bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Å¿eparate vs from the loue of GOD,
which is in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us our Lorde: for in
all theÅ¿e thinges wee are more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours
through him that loued vs, and
this is our ChriÅ¿t that Å¿itteth in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
for vs.</hi> By this his glorie and power
euer Å¿ince his aÅ¿cending, hee hath mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
the eÅ¿tate and welfare of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and will doe to the ende of the
worlde. The laÅ¿t thing wee learne by
ChriÅ¿tes aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion, is this, that he is alÅ¿o
<pb facs="tcp:10917:76"/>
aÅ¿cended to leade captiuitie captiue, that
is to Å¿ay, to beate downe and ouerthrowe
all his foes, and Å¿uch as ryÅ¿e vp heere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynÅ¿t
him: Å¿o that as his power is a great
comfort to his Å¿pouÅ¿e, Å¿o it is as great a
terrour and griefe to the wicked repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
to thinke or to conÅ¿ider of it. For it
maketh them to frette and fume, and to
bee euer at their wittes ende for Å¿orowe
and griefe, that hee muÅ¿t ouercome in Å¿pite
of their teeth. Then wee learne, that our
enemies Å¿hall not alway tryumph ouer vs,
they Å¿hall not Å¿till haue vs in their bandes,
in pryÅ¿on and thraldome, but one day they
Å¿urely them Å¿elues Å¿hall come to confuÅ¿ion
and Å¿hame. The Scriptures, when they
will paynt out ChriÅ¿t vnto vs in mercie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
his Church, they giue him the name
of a meeke and gentle Lambe, apparelled
in white, making no Å¿turre or cry in the
Å¿treetes, not breaking a bruÅ¿ed reede, nor
quenching a Å¿moking fla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But when the Prophets will Å¿ette foorth
ChriÅ¿t in his maieÅ¿tie and glorie, after his
aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion, they giue him the name and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie
of a fierce Lion, all apparelled in
redde and bloody garmentes, with a rodde
<pb facs="tcp:10917:76"/>
and Å¿cepter of iron in his hande to rule and
gouerne all nations. And this no doubt is,
to cauÅ¿e &amp; make the enemies of his Church
to quake, euen as hee Å¿hewed him Å¿elfe in a
viÅ¿ion to Saint Iohn his beloued diÅ¿ciple,
to comfort him no doubt, but to terrifie the
enemies which were Å¿hortly to goe about to
deÅ¿troy the Church of God. Wee reade in
the Reuelation 1. cha. that as Iohn turned
backe to heare the voyce that Å¿pake w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him,
ChriÅ¿t Å¿hewed him Å¿elfe vnto him in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieÅ¿tie,

downe to the feete, and girded about the
pappes with a golden girdle: his head and
heares were white as white wooll, and as
Å¿nowe, and his eyes were as a flame of fire,
and his feete lyke vnto fine braÅ¿Å¿e, burning
as in a furnace, and his voyce as the Å¿ound
of many waters, and he had in his ryght
hand Å¿euen Å¿tarres, and out of his mouth
went a Å¿harpe two edged Å¿woorde, and
his face Å¿hone as the Sunne Å¿hyneth in
his Å¿trength.</hi> This viÅ¿ion of ChriÅ¿t in his
glorie was Å¿o fearefull, that it made Iohn
him Å¿elfe afrayde, but the Lorde dyd Å¿hewe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:77"/>
him Å¿elfe Å¿o, to comforte his Å¿eruauntes
which Å¿hould Å¿uffer perÅ¿ecution a litle after,
but to threaten the enemies by his mightie
power. This is that which the holy GhoÅ¿t
Å¿pake long Å¿ince by Dauid, <hi>The Lorde
reigneth, let the people tremble, hee fitteth
betweene the Cherubims, let the earth be
mooued, the Lorde is great in Zion, and
he is hie aboue all people. The Lorde
that is at thy ryght hande, Å¿hall wounde
Kings in the day of his wrath, he Å¿hall bee
iudge among the heathen, he Å¿hall fill all
with dead bodyes, and Å¿mite the heades
ouer great countreys.</hi> Here wee Å¿ee howe
Dauid Å¿peaketh moÅ¿t magnificently of
this glorious kingdome of ChriÅ¿t, beyng
nowe exalted aboue the heauens by his aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenÅ¿ion:
howe hee aÅ¿Å¿ureth the enemies of
deÅ¿truction, but promiÅ¿eth deliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>erie to the
godly in the Church. As ChriÅ¿t did alwayes
deliuer his Church, euen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
Noah from the flood, drowning the

the remnant with fire, the IÅ¿raelites
from the bondage of Egypt, and the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of king Pharao, ouerthrowing his
euennes in the redde Å¿ea, for ChriÅ¿t was that
<pb facs="tcp:10917:77"/>
great Angel that went before them: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e
in deÅ¿troying the AÅ¿Å¿yrians Å¿o many
thouÅ¿andes in one nyght, and Å¿auing good
king Hezekia and the reÅ¿t, Å¿o did hee moÅ¿t
wonderfully deÅ¿troy great Babylon, and
ranÅ¿ome thence his owne priÅ¿oners: finally,
howe he deÅ¿troyed the Edomites, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,
the Moabites, the PhiliÅ¿tims, and
the Canaanites, they that reade the hyÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bible, Å¿hal wel perceiue: as (I Å¿ay)
ChriÅ¿t hath done theÅ¿e thinges to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
before his incarnation, Å¿o eÅ¿pecially
after hee was receyued vp in glorie, hee
hath done the like. Howe mightily did hee
Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e and beate downe the great rage
and furie of Saul, beyng armed and Å¿ette
as a fierce Tyger, or Lion, to deÅ¿troy both
man, woman and childe of ChriÅ¿ts flocke?
But the Lorde IeÅ¿us from heauen Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
him, and made him as tame as a
Lambe, Actes 9. Did hee not cutte off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke
Å¿ort that cruell tyraunt Herode, that
killed Iames, &amp; had alÅ¿o taken Peter? It is
Å¿ayd, that in his pryde he gaue not GOD

Howe Iulian the Emperour, that wicked

of his death, as in deede hee was the chiefe

the thirde poynt was the great aÅ¿Å¿urance of

euerlaÅ¿ting death and deÅ¿truction, from the
preÅ¿ence of the Lord, and from the glory of

in this life, doeth Å¿hewe and Å¿et foorth vnto
all the worlde moÅ¿t wonderfull Å¿ignes and
tokens, both of his mercy to the elect, and
iuÅ¿tice to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reprobate: but becauÅ¿e his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is not of this worlde, therefore our
faith muÅ¿t amount hier to conÅ¿ider of his
laÅ¿t comming, wherein hee Å¿hall Å¿hewe as
great glorie and maieÅ¿tie, as he did humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and meekenes in his firÅ¿t comming in
the fleÅ¿h. For as we doe beleeue that he is
appointed of his father, to bee the Å¿auiour
and redeemer of mankinde: Å¿o doe we alÅ¿o
<pb facs="tcp:10917:81"/>
confeÅ¿Å¿e him to be ordeined the great iudge
of the vniuerÅ¿all world, &amp; that it is he alone
that Å¿hall iudge with vnÅ¿peakeable glory,
both great and Å¿mall at his appearance: Å¿o
that although many men thinke that there
is no generall iudgement, yet at the laÅ¿t,
they Å¿hall feele that this iudge Å¿hal Å¿ummo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
them all to appeare moÅ¿t fearefully before
his imperiall throne of maieÅ¿tie. And this
iudgement of ChriÅ¿t Å¿tandeth with good
reaÅ¿on and iuÅ¿tice, that it Å¿hould be openly
Å¿eene and perceiued of all men at the laÅ¿t,
leÅ¿t either the wiÅ¿edome of the fleÅ¿h or ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s
reaÅ¿on, or the multitude of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked Å¿hould
be able iuÅ¿tly to charge vs (as they do moÅ¿t
vniuÅ¿tly) that we faine to our Å¿elues a God,
a Lord, a ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿uch an head as neuer
Å¿heweth him Å¿elfe, nor was Å¿eene of men.
Wherefore to auoyde this Å¿lander and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche
of the blaÅ¿phemous mouthes which
Å¿ay, Where is now your God? let him Å¿hew
him Å¿elfe: we (I Å¿ay) doe beleeue, that one
daye hee Å¿hall come to iudge the whole
earth. For this is that, that <hi>Saint Iohn</hi>
Å¿ayeth in his <hi>Reuelation, 1. 7. Beholde,
he commeth with cloudes, and euery eye
Å¿hal Å¿ee him, euen they which pearced him

through, and all kinreds of the earth Å¿hall
wayle before him, euen Å¿o, Amen.</hi> Let the
wicked men therefore, and the mockers of
this iudgement, triumphe neuer Å¿o much,
yet Å¿hall they not be able to hinder or diÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null
the deuice and purpoÅ¿e of the Lorde.
They doe in deede bende their tongues
like bowes, to Å¿hoote out blaÅ¿phemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t
the Lord, Å¿aying, <hi>Where is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e
of his comming?</hi> But let thoÅ¿e men
vnderÅ¿tande, that as the Lorde IeÅ¿us was
Å¿eene to goe vp into heauen, Å¿o Å¿hall hee
come downe agayne from heauen, as the
Angels of God reported, <hi>Actes</hi> 1. 11. And
albeit they will not beleeue it, but make a
ieÅ¿t of it, yet they Å¿hall feele it one daye to
their great payne and Å¿orowe. It is meete
then, and requiÅ¿ite, that he that was (for our
Å¿aluation before the iudgement Å¿eat of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>)
vniuÅ¿tly condemned, Å¿houlde Å¿hewe in the

ouer al fleÅ¿h is, and what his iuÅ¿tice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.
Seeing then we muÅ¿t all appeare
before the iudgement Å¿eate of ChriÅ¿t, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
euery man according to his woorkes
which he hath done here in his body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be good or bad: for the more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider
<pb facs="tcp:10917:82"/>
howe many things are neceÅ¿Å¿arily to
be marked in this iudgement. There are
Å¿euen points to be obÅ¿erued in this matter:
firÅ¿t, the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t it Å¿elf, Å¿econdly, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudge,
thirdly, the perÅ¿ons that Å¿hall bee iudged,
fourthly, the maner of this iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, after
what Å¿ort it Å¿hall be, fiftly, the time, Å¿ixtly, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
place, and laÅ¿t of all, the finall cauÅ¿e or ende
of this iudgement, wherefore it is ordeined
and reÅ¿erued. But before we Å¿peak of theÅ¿e
things in order, we muÅ¿t anÅ¿were to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,
which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>monly made of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿kilfull
and vnlearned againÅ¿t this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
for when they hear of this iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t,
they aÅ¿ke to what ende it Å¿hall be, Å¿eeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man that dieth, is iudged already, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to heauen, or els to hel, as Å¿oone as the
breath is out of his body: therefore it may
Å¿eeme that this day is Å¿uperfluous &amp; neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.
To this we make anÅ¿were, that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is of two Å¿ortes, for there is a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
iudgement, and a <hi>generall.</hi> In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
iudgement of God, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> is iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in Å¿oule incontinently, as he departeth
this life, but this is for the Å¿oule only. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
generall iudgement, both the body &amp; Å¿oule
Å¿halbe ioyned together, and Å¿o enter either
into ioye, if they beleeue in ChriÅ¿t, or into
<pb facs="tcp:10917:83"/>
payne, if they beleeue not. For vntill this
day the man is but vnperfit, as hauing the
Å¿oule onely in bliÅ¿Å¿e, and not his bodye,
which Å¿hall in this iudgement bee rayÅ¿ed
vp, and put vnto the Å¿oule. To this ende is
the generall iudgement: and this article
doeth proue vnto vs the reÅ¿urrection of
our bodies: for if all muÅ¿t bee iudged, euen
in the bodyes alÅ¿o, then the bodyes of
the dead muÅ¿t riÅ¿e agayne, and come to
iudgement, to receiue in their bodies, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
euerlaÅ¿ting life to immortalitie, if
they haue done well here: or els euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting
death, to their endles payne and
griefe. Agayne, this daye is to make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t
vnto all men in the worlde, euery
mans eÅ¿tate, eyther to Å¿aluation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:
for all Å¿hall appeare toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before their iudge viÅ¿ibly. The Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doeth make mention of three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings
of ChriÅ¿t. The one was in the fleÅ¿h
among the Iewes in very poore eÅ¿tate,
baÅ¿e and Å¿imple, when hee did redeeme vs:
this we doe beleeue to bee paÅ¿t and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
already according to the Prophets, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t
that wicked opinion of the Iewes,
which deny he is come in the fleÅ¿h. Another
comming of ChriÅ¿t is by his holy Å¿pirite,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:83"/>
grace, power, and worde into our heartes:
and when his miniÅ¿ters doe come vnto
vs in his name to preache his worde and
GoÅ¿pell vnto vs, then is he Å¿ayde to come
vnto vs. Of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ming vnto euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
mans conÅ¿cience, our Å¿auiour Å¿peaketh
of in the 14. of <hi>Saint Iohns</hi> GoÅ¿pel on this
wyÅ¿e, <hi>If any man loue me, hee will keepe
my worde, and my father will loue him,
and we will come vnto him, and dwell
with him.</hi> And againe, a litle before, <hi>He
that loueth me, Å¿halbe loued of my father,
and I will loue him, and will Å¿hewe mine
owne Å¿elfe vnto him.</hi> So we doe pray that
<hi>his kingdome</hi> of grace may <hi>come vnto
vs,</hi> and wholy poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e our heartes and
myndes. But neither of theÅ¿e commings
doe wee Å¿peake of in this place. The thirde
comming of ChriÅ¿t is to iudgement moÅ¿t
royally in his glorious kingdome, with all
his mighty and holy Angels, and whole
number of his Saintes, at the laÅ¿t daye,
when all Å¿hall appeare before him. The
laÅ¿t iudgement of ChriÅ¿t (which was the
firÅ¿t part of our diuiÅ¿ion) is moÅ¿t cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
and Å¿ure to come: if any doubt of it,
let him reade theÅ¿e places for his confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for to recken the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> all vp, were too long
<pb facs="tcp:10917:84"/>
and tedious a matter: <hi>Matth. 24. 25. Mark.

chap.</hi> This iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t of ChriÅ¿t Å¿halbe moÅ¿t
iuÅ¿t and vpright: &amp; although hee were moÅ¿t
falÅ¿ly iudged and condemned, yet Å¿hall he
iudge his enemies moÅ¿t truely, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
whoÅ¿e iudgement it Å¿hall not be lawful for
any man to appeale. Wee knowe, Å¿aieth
Paul, that <hi>the iudgement of God is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to righteouÅ¿nes, Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.</hi> 2. And <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
affirmed the like, and Å¿o did <hi>Dauid,
The Lord Å¿hal iudge his people with equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
Although iudges here be corrupt and
faulty, as bribed with giftes, affectioned
with friendes, lead with feare, moued with
fauour, or by any other meanes induced to
peruert iuÅ¿tice, yet ChriÅ¿tes iudgement
Å¿hall haue none of all thoÅ¿e corruptions
and infirmities. He Å¿hall haue moÅ¿t diuine,
yea, infinite wiÅ¿dome, that hee be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
not onely to Å¿ee thinges open and
manifeÅ¿t, but alÅ¿o to iudge and to diÅ¿cerne
the very Å¿ecretes and thoughtes of the
heart, as Paul Å¿ayth, <hi>Hee will lighten the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:84"/>
things hid in darkeneÅ¿Å¿e, and make the
counÅ¿els of the heartes manifeÅ¿t, 1. Cor.</hi> 4.
His Å¿entence Å¿hall be Å¿incere and Å¿ounde,
not partial, inclining more to one part, then
to another, in whome neither the loue of
friendes, nor feare of foes, nor bribery by
giftes and rewardes, Å¿hal haue any part
or place. <hi>For there is no reÅ¿pect of perÅ¿ons
with ChriÅ¿t, Roman.</hi> 2. Seeing then (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)
that this iudgement is Å¿o Å¿euere and
Å¿traight, let vs be diligent, that we may be
founde of him in peace without Å¿pot, and
blameleÅ¿Å¿e, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> doeth counÅ¿ell vs.
Thus much for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgement it Å¿elfe, which
was the firÅ¿t thing propoÅ¿ed. Now let vs
come to the Å¿econd part, to conÅ¿ider who is
our iudge. It is Å¿ayde, that he Å¿hall come to
iudge, that is, ChriÅ¿t: for to him is al iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
committted, &amp; the father doth iudge
in the perÅ¿on of his Å¿onne, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. becauÅ¿e
all men Å¿houlde honour the Å¿onne, as they
honour y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father. I neede not to bring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places for the proofe of this, the Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are full of it, that ChriÅ¿t is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿upreme
iudge, and I hope I neede not to perÅ¿wade
men in the doctrine. Let vs rather Å¿ee what
we may gather out of this doctrine, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it to our conÅ¿ciences, for our conÅ¿olati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:10917:85"/>
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fort. The vÅ¿e of this doctrine, y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> ChriÅ¿t
is our iudge, is two fold: either in reÅ¿pect of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked, or els as concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good. As
concerning the good, y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall be their
only iudge, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> not but greatly reioyce
&amp; conceiue a wonderful comfort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
&amp; brother Å¿hal be their iudge, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he wil not iudge partially, yet Å¿ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
being a brother &amp; Å¿auiour, yea y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of
his body, will iudge moÅ¿t mercifully: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Å¿auiour biddeth vs, when we Å¿ee
this iudgement drawe neere, to lift vp our
heades and to reioyce, becauÅ¿e our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
draweth on. For how Å¿hould we feare,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> ChriÅ¿t wil make vs iudges with him?
as he Å¿ayth, <hi>Ye that haue folowed me in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, Å¿hal Å¿it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> twelue thrones, &amp;
iudge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> twelue tribes of IÅ¿rael.</hi> And Paul
Å¿ayth, <hi>Doe ye not know,</hi> that <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿aintes Å¿hal
iudge the world?</hi> Not that we Å¿hale be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
with ChriÅ¿t, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we Å¿hal allow &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t. For to Å¿peak properly,
the elect Å¿hall not be iudged, but the wicked
Å¿hall be iudged to euerlaÅ¿ting fire. This
certainly is no Å¿mal comfort for weake co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ciences,
to conÅ¿ider y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prince Å¿hal iudge
his owne people &amp; Å¿ubiectes, the head his
<pb facs="tcp:10917:85"/>
members, &amp; the aduocate his clients. How
then can he condemne thoÅ¿e, for whoÅ¿e Å¿afe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
he doth come, &amp; will ratifye y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> promiÅ¿e
of euerlaÅ¿ting bliÅ¿Å¿e, which he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed
here in this life by his GoÅ¿pel? We Å¿hal
not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> be cited before any other tribunall
Å¿eate, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of our louing bridegro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>e, who Å¿hal
make himÅ¿elfe ready to receiue his Å¿pouÅ¿e &amp;
wife, vnto himÅ¿elfe for euer. <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 21.
This day is called the mariage day of the
Lambe, and his Å¿upper: and his wife Å¿hall
then be arayed with pure and fine linen and
Å¿hining, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouÅ¿nes of Å¿ayntes.
Let vs therefore be glad and reioyce, and
giue glory to him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Å¿itteth vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> throne.
There can be no day here Å¿o ioyful as this,
yea al comfort is nothing to this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ChriÅ¿t
Å¿halbe our iudge. He ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>not caÅ¿t away the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> for
whom he hath died: he cannot deny himÅ¿elf.
Paul whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he conÅ¿idered of this iudge and
iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, reioyced eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in priÅ¿o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a crowne
of righteouÅ¿nes was laid vp for him, which
the righteous iudge ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us would
giue vnto him in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. And here
we learne a very good leÅ¿Å¿on by the way, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
if ChriÅ¿t be our iudge, we muÅ¿t (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
not haue redreÅ¿Å¿e here, or iudgement equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
miniÅ¿tred vnto vs) referre our cauÅ¿es
<pb facs="tcp:10917:86"/>
and matters of iniurie to him, who is able
to reforme all things, and will at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
So that we muÅ¿t not, which are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
men, reuenge our owne quarels and
iniuries, but commit them al to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
murmuring, and hee will iudge them
iuÅ¿tly. Then this doth teache vs patience, to
wayte for this comming of ChriÅ¿t, to iudge
all thinges orderly. And this good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ayle
did <hi>Saint Iames</hi> giue in his time to
the poore oppreÅ¿Å¿ed labourers &amp; huÅ¿band<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which were defrauded by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rich men,
&amp; had their hier and wages kept backe: hee
doeth comfort them in this reÅ¿pect, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ChriÅ¿t
wil come to iudge their cauÅ¿e, Å¿aying, <hi>Be
patient, brethren, vntill the comming of
the Lord, and Å¿ettle your heartes: for the
comming of our Lorde draweth nere.</hi> Yea
and our Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t Å¿ayde, <hi>Luk. 18. that
God will auenge his elect, which cry day
and night vnto him, and that Å¿hortly.</hi>
Whereby we may gather alÅ¿o, that the day
of iudgement is not farre off as the wicked
doe Å¿uppoÅ¿e, but draweth on, euery day nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
then other. Let vs therefore, as our Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
doth counÅ¿el vs, watch and pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
that we may be able to Å¿tand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him at his comming to iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t. We
<pb facs="tcp:10917:86"/>
Å¿ee then that we muÅ¿t commit our cauÅ¿es
to ChriÅ¿t, &amp; offer our complaintes againÅ¿t
the wicked to him, <hi>and then doutles with
our eyes we Å¿hal behold &amp; Å¿ee the reward
of the wicked, PÅ¿al.</hi> 91. As this is very
comfortable doctrine to the godly, to heare
that ChriÅ¿t is their iudge and auditor of
al their cauÅ¿es: Å¿o is it as doleful and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
a thing to the wicked and caÅ¿t awaies,
to wey with themÅ¿elues, that ChriÅ¿t their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
Å¿halbe their iudge, whome they haue
alwayes in their life time hated, made a
mocke of, and had in vtter contempt, both
him, his GoÅ¿pel, and miniÅ¿ters of his word
and Å¿acraments. This Å¿hall pearce them to
the very heart, to Å¿ee him their iudge, whom
they could neuer abyde: yea his Å¿ight, and
preÅ¿ence Å¿halbe Å¿o feareful, and terrible vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them all, that they Å¿hall curÅ¿e the time,
that euer they were borne: for they Å¿hal hide
themÅ¿elues in dennes, and rockes of the
mountaines, and Å¿hall Å¿ay to the hilles, Fall
vpon vs, and hide vs from the preÅ¿ence of
him that Å¿itteth vpon the throne, and from
the wrath of the Lambe: for the great day
of his wrath is come, and who can Å¿tande?
TheÅ¿e and the like wordes Å¿hall they vtter
for dolour and anguiÅ¿h of minde, and yet
<pb facs="tcp:10917:87"/>
finde no comfort: for they haue refuÅ¿ed the
Lorde and God of all comfort here vpon
the earth, and therefore Å¿hall not haue him
there to be their comforter. And <hi>S. Iohn</hi>
doeth tell vs who theÅ¿e are, to whome
this iudge IeÅ¿us Å¿halbe Å¿o fierce and cruel:
euen the kinges of the earth, and the great
men, and the riche men, and the chiefe
captaines, and the mightie men, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
bond man, and euery free man,
<hi>Reuelation</hi> 6. not meaning all kings, and
noble men, but Å¿ome of euery Å¿tate and
Å¿orte of men, yea, the greater part of euery
degree of men, eÅ¿pecially of great men:
for not many noble, not many wiÅ¿e, not
many mightie men are called to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> GoÅ¿pel, leÅ¿t they Å¿hould bragge:
but rather the poore, the baÅ¿e, the vnwiÅ¿e
are choÅ¿en, becauÅ¿e they Å¿hould not vant
of their worthineÅ¿Å¿e, as Paul doeth tell vs
in the 1. <hi>Corinthians. 1 Chap.</hi> moÅ¿t nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
To conclude this part, Å¿eeing the
Lord Å¿hal be iudge to the wicked, euen the
Lord IeÅ¿us, to render flaming fire, and
vengeance vnto them that know not God,
and obey not his GoÅ¿pel, this may teach
them to feare and to liue Å¿omewhat more
orderly, if not for the loue of God, of
<pb facs="tcp:10917:87"/>
heauen, and vertue: yet for feare of hell,
death and damnation, to auoyde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that wil light vpon Å¿inne at that day.
Let vs come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third poynt. The perÅ¿o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s
that Å¿hall come before this iudge to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
and trÃ¬ed in iudgement, they are
Å¿ayde here to be the quicke and the dead,
that is to Å¿ay, al, both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuing and the dead.
But here Å¿ome may aÅ¿ke this queÅ¿tion,
Seeing it is appointed to al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> once to die,
becauÅ¿e they are mortal, how is it Å¿aid here,
that Å¿ome Å¿hall be quicke and aliue at
the comming of ChriÅ¿t? To this wee
make anÅ¿were, that they that Å¿halbe aliue
at the Å¿econd comming of ChriÅ¿t to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Å¿hall as it were dye, for they Å¿hall
all be changed and renewed, and that Å¿ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
as if they had bene long dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
and this is the meaning of Paul, 1
<hi>Corinth. 15. Wee Å¿hal not all dye,</hi> that
is, wee Å¿hall not all be layde in the graue
as others, <hi>but we Å¿hall all be in a moment
altered,</hi> which Å¿halbe in Å¿teade of a death
vnto vs. So we Å¿ee what we haue to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿were
to this queÅ¿tion. The perÅ¿ons then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
are to be Å¿u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>moned &amp; cited to appeare by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
voyce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Archangel &amp; tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pet of God, in
<pb facs="tcp:10917:88"/>
a woord generally are all men, that euer
haue bene from the firÅ¿t man Adam, or Å¿hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
to the laÅ¿t man that Å¿halbe borne here
vpon the earth. None can eÅ¿cape this iudge,
or hide himÅ¿elfe away from his Å¿ight, which
Å¿eeth into the bottome of the Å¿ea, euen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the middeÅ¿t of the earth and hell: none
Å¿halbe forgotten, not the leÅ¿t childe that is,
for he hath all written in his bookes, both
good and bad, great and Å¿mall: for theÅ¿e are
the wordes of the holy GhoÅ¿t, <hi>We muÅ¿t all
appeare before the iudgement Å¿eate of
ChriÅ¿t.</hi> And againe, <hi>As I liue, Å¿aith the Lord,
euery knee Å¿hall bowe to me, and euery
tongue confeÅ¿Å¿e to me.</hi> None then Å¿halbe
miÅ¿Å¿ing: no not the great Monarches, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
and Kings of the earth Å¿hall
helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿elues here or flee away, but they
Å¿halbe brought to iudgement, and Å¿tand at
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barre as others do, &amp; be brought as lowe
as the loweÅ¿t. Wel, let vs apply this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
for our vÅ¿e, to profit by it. Of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
that we muÅ¿t al come to iudgement,
and none eÅ¿cape, Paul gathereth this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
and leÅ¿Å¿on: that knowing the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of the Lorde, we Å¿hould doe our duety,
that both dwelling at home and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
from home, wee may be acceptable
<pb facs="tcp:10917:88"/>
vnto him. For it made Paul the more rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to doe his office and function in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
Å¿aying, <hi>We knowing this, perÅ¿wade
men, and are made manifeÅ¿t vnto God,
and I truÅ¿t alÅ¿o that we are made manifeÅ¿t
vnto your conÅ¿ciences, 2. Corin.</hi> 5. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
let vs Å¿ee the maner and order of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
iudgement. Our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t
doeth moÅ¿t liuely deÅ¿cribe it in the 25. of
Matthewes GoÅ¿pel, Å¿aying, <hi>When the
Sonne of man commeth in his glory, and
all the holy angels with him, then Å¿hall he
Å¿it vpon the throne of his glory, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him Å¿hall be gathered all nations, and
he Å¿hall Å¿eparate them one from another,
as a Å¿hephearde Å¿eparateth the Å¿heepe
from the goates, and he Å¿hal Å¿et the Å¿heepe
on his right hand, and the goates on his
left: then Å¿hall the king Å¿ay to them on
his right hand, Come ye bleÅ¿Å¿ed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
take the inheritance of the kingdome
prepared for you, from the foundation of
the world: For I was hungry, and ye gaue
me meate, I was thirÅ¿tie, and ye gaue mee
drinke, I was a Å¿tranger, and ye tooke me
in vnto you, I was naked, and ye clothed
me, I was Å¿icke, and ye viÅ¿ited me, I was in
priÅ¿on, and ye came vnto me, and Å¿o forth.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:89"/>
Then Å¿hal he Å¿ay to them on his left hand,
Depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> mee ye curÅ¿ed into euerlaÅ¿ting
fire, which is prepared for the deuill and
his angels: For I was an hungred, and yee
gaue mee no meate, I thirÅ¿ted, and yee
gaue me no drinke, &amp;c. And theÅ¿e Å¿hall
goe into euerlaÅ¿ting payne, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
into life eternall.</hi> Here wee Å¿ee the
fourme and order of this iudgement, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribed
moÅ¿t liuely vnto vs in the perÅ¿on of
ChriÅ¿t a King, putting Å¿ome on the ryght
hande, and Å¿ome on the left hande. S. Paul
alÅ¿o doth Å¿et it out vnto vs moÅ¿t excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tly,
<hi>that the Lord IeÅ¿us Å¿hall deÅ¿cend fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
with a Å¿houte, and with the voyce of
the Archangel, and Trumpet of God, and
the dead in ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall ryÅ¿e firÅ¿t, and wee
which remayne aliue, Å¿hall bee caught vp
with them alÅ¿o into the cloudes, to meete
the Lorde in the ayre: and Å¿o Å¿hall we bee
euer with the Lorde.</hi> Where note, that he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>etteth it out onely for the comfort of the
godly, making no mention in this place of
the wicked. Saint Peter Å¿aith, <hi>It Å¿hall be
as a thiefe in the nyght, in the which the
heauens Å¿hall paÅ¿Å¿e away with a noyÅ¿e,
and the elementes Å¿hall melt with heate,
and the earth with the woorkes that are
<pb facs="tcp:10917:89"/>
therein, Å¿halbe burnt vp. 2. Pet.</hi> 3. S. Iohn
in the Reuelation doeth very effectually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿e
this thing in like maner: for he Å¿aieth,
<hi>that a great white throne was Å¿et which
he Å¿aw, and one that Å¿ate vpon it, and the
dead Å¿tood both great &amp; Å¿mal before God,
the bookes were opened, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿ea, and death,
and hel gaue vp their dead, and euery man
was iudged according to the things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the bookes, Reuel.</hi> 20. Wee learne
this good leÅ¿Å¿on by it, as Peter doeth teach
vs, that Å¿eeing the maner of this great and
laÅ¿t day of iudgement by ChriÅ¿t, Å¿hall be Å¿o
terrible in reÅ¿pect of the alteration of the
creatures, wee ought to be holy in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿ation
and godlineÅ¿Å¿e, looking, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting
for the comming of that day of the
Lord IeÅ¿us to iudgement. And here fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
wee gather, that heauen and earth
Å¿hall be diÅ¿Å¿olued, and made newe, that this
worlde nowe Å¿hall haue an ende, as it had a
beginning, contrary to the falÅ¿e opinion of
the PhiloÅ¿ophers and wicked AtheiÅ¿tes of
our time, which thinke that all things Å¿hall
continue (as they doe) for euer. Thus much
for the maner of the iudgement. Nowe as
concerning the time, our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t
hath forewarned vs, <hi>that it is not for vs to
<pb facs="tcp:10917:90"/>
knowe the times and Å¿eaÅ¿ons which the
father hath put in his owne power, Act. 1.
For of that daye and houre, knoweth no
man: no not the angels which are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
neyther the Sonne him Å¿elfe, but my
Father onely</hi> (Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t.) Which is to be
vnderÅ¿toode, that ChriÅ¿t knoweth not the
latter day as hee is man, but as he is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
God, and one with his Father, euen
his wiÅ¿edome, he knoweth it, and al things
elÅ¿e. We Å¿ee then, that the day and houre is
moÅ¿t vncertaine, and yet the thing it Å¿elfe
moÅ¿t certaine that it Å¿hall be. But although
this day and houre be vnknowen, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding,
our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs Å¿ignes and tokens of his comming,
which may Å¿turre vs vp the more warily to
waite for his comming. TheÅ¿e things our
Sauiour Å¿ayd Å¿houlde come to paÅ¿Å¿e before
he came, &amp; we Å¿ee they are fulfilled already:
many Å¿hall come in his name to deceiue vs,
Å¿aying, I am ChriÅ¿t, &amp; Å¿hall deceyue many:
we Å¿hall heare of warres: nation Å¿hall riÅ¿e a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t
nation, realme againÅ¿t realme, there
Å¿hall be famine, earthquakes, and peÅ¿tilence
in diuers places: the godly Å¿halbe afflicted,
killed, and hated of al men for ChriÅ¿ts Å¿ake:
many Å¿hall bee offended at the GoÅ¿pel, and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:90"/>
betray one another: the father the Å¿onne, and
the Å¿onne the father: the brother againÅ¿t the
brother, Å¿hall riÅ¿e, and put him to death: falÅ¿e
prophets Å¿hall aryÅ¿e and deceiue many, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
Å¿halbe increaÅ¿ed, and the loue of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Å¿hall bee colde, and the GoÅ¿pel Å¿hall bee
preached vnto all nations, and then Å¿hall the
end come. Furthermore there Å¿halbe Å¿ignes
in the Å¿unne, and in the moone, and in the
Å¿tarres: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿unne Å¿halbe darkened, the moone
Å¿hall not giue her lyght, and the Å¿tarres of
heauen Å¿hall fall: which things haue come to
paÅ¿Å¿e, whither you take them litterally, or
allegorically: for both the Å¿unne and moone
hath beene eclipÅ¿ed, and Å¿ignes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
haue appeared in the Å¿tarres, and if ye
take the Å¿onne for the worde of God and
GoÅ¿pel, we Å¿ee it hath bene darkened, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buÅ¿ed
by the PapiÅ¿tes. The moone which
doth repreÅ¿ent the Church, which taketh her
light from the Å¿unne IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, hath byn
perÅ¿ecuted &amp; turned into blood, and not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
her light by reaÅ¿on of troubles: and the
Å¿tarres which are likened to the preachers,
haue fallen away, and otherwiÅ¿e Å¿tept aÅ¿ide.
TheÅ¿e things and the lyke may put vs in
minde, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ming of ChriÅ¿t is not far
off, euen as when we Å¿ee the trees begin to
<pb facs="tcp:10917:91"/>
budde, we know then that the Å¿pring time is
neere. We know furthermore that the time
of this iudgement Å¿halbe very Å¿udden, as the
lightnings, or as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ming of a thiefe, and
as the Å¿udden crying out of a woman with
childe. For as it was in the dayes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> floud
in Noes time, the waters came and tooke
them all away, Å¿o Å¿hall the comming of the
Å¿onne of man be. LikewiÅ¿e alÅ¿o, as it was in
the dayes of Lot, they ate, they dranke, they
bought, they Å¿olde, they planted, they buylt,
they gaue in marriage, and married wiues,
but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day that Lot went out of Sodom,
it rayned fire &amp; brimÅ¿tone from heauen, and
deÅ¿troyed them all. After theÅ¿e enÅ¿amples
Å¿hall it be in the day whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the Sonne of man
is reuealed. And Å¿urely this day is hid from
our eyes, that we Å¿houlde be prepared euery
day, &amp; not be Å¿ecure or careles, to differre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and put it off from day to day, as a
great many do among vs. Seeing then the
time is at hand, and yet vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, we ought
to be prepared and be in a readines, &amp; to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
our MaÅ¿ters counÅ¿el: for he Å¿aith, <hi>Take
heed to your Å¿elues, leaÅ¿t at any time your
hearts be oppreÅ¿Å¿ed with Å¿urfeting &amp; drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes,
and cares of this life, and leaÅ¿t that
day come on you at vnwares: for as a Å¿nare
<pb facs="tcp:10917:91"/>
Å¿hall it come vpon all them that dwell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the face of the whole earth.</hi> Watch
therefore and pray continually, that ye may
be counted worthy to eÅ¿cape all theÅ¿e things
that Å¿hall come to paÅ¿Å¿e, &amp; that ye may Å¿tande
before the Sonne of man. This daye is as
the day and time of our death, as we knowe
not when we Å¿hall die, and yet it is moÅ¿t cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that we Å¿hall die: Å¿o it is with this day.
And whether a man Å¿houlde looke for the
day of his death, or this day of iudgement
firÅ¿t, truely I can not tell: they are both
Å¿o vncertaine, neither haue we longer war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of time preÅ¿cribed vnto vs in the Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the one, then of the other. I praye
God, the Lord IeÅ¿us may finde vs as good
Å¿eruants, doing his will and woorke at his
comming, that wee may haue our candles
burning in our handes, with oyle in our
lampes, and the marriage garment on our
backes, ready to open the doore, when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
and knocketh for vs. Happy Å¿hal we be
if the Lord find vs Å¿o doing: otherwiÅ¿e, if he
finde vs Å¿miting our felow Å¿eruants, eating
and drinking, &amp; being drunken, he Å¿hal come
vpon vs at vnwares, and cut vs in pieces, &amp;
giue vs our portion with the vnbelieuers &amp;
hypocrites, where Å¿halbe weeping and gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hing
<pb facs="tcp:10917:92"/>
of teeth. Let vs therefore I beÅ¿eeche
you brethren by the Lorde IeÅ¿us, knowing
the time is Å¿hort and at hande, euen in the
doores, gird vp the loines of our minde, that
when our Sauiour knocketh, we may open
vnto him immediatly. Thus wee Å¿ee what
we haue to note and learne vpon the time of
the comming of ChriÅ¿t vnto iudgement.
The place alÅ¿o is to be conÅ¿idered, the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and kinreds of the people that Å¿hall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
that day, are Å¿o many and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the earth Å¿hall not bee able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
them all: therefore Saint Paul Å¿aith,
that <hi>we Å¿hall be caught vp in the cloudes,
to meete the Lord in the ayre.</hi> So that all
Å¿hall bee taken vp into the ayre as the place
of iudgement. But I come to the laÅ¿t poynt
which is more materiall to our purpoÅ¿e, for
what ende this great and laÅ¿t day is reÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and kept in Å¿tore. It hath two endes or
cauÅ¿es, why it is ordayned of the Lorde: the
one is, that the godly may be deliuered out
of their miÅ¿eries and troubles, which they
haue here Å¿toutly endured for ChriÅ¿tes
Å¿ake, and be receyued into euerlaÅ¿ting life.
The other is, that the wicked &amp; reprobate,
and all the companie of infidels, which haue
herecontemned the Lord, &amp; liued in pleaÅ¿ure
<pb facs="tcp:10917:92"/>
and delites of the fleÅ¿he, may be iuÅ¿tly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed
as they haue well deÅ¿erued, with euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laÅ¿ting
fire &amp; brimÅ¿tone, which is the Å¿econd
death. For it might Å¿eeme if there were no
iudgement or life after this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lord were
notiuÅ¿t in his doings: for neither are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly
and ryghteous rewarded many times in
this life, neyther are the vngodly puniÅ¿hed
for their offences while they liue here, for
the moÅ¿t part. Now God is moÅ¿t iuÅ¿t, which
will rewarde all godlines and vertue, and
Å¿euerely puniÅ¿h vice and wickednes. TheÅ¿e
two endes, doth our Sauiour mention in
the general iudgement: the one Å¿ort Å¿aith he,
<hi>Å¿hall goe into euerlaÅ¿ting life, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Å¿ort into euerlaÅ¿ting fire,</hi> Matth. 25.
Saint Paul likewiÅ¿e doth make mention of
theÅ¿e cauÅ¿es, in the Å¿econd epiÅ¿t. of the TheÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alonians,
the firÅ¿t chapter, Å¿hewing as well
what the good Å¿hall haue, as the bad, Å¿aying
on this wiÅ¿e, <hi>It is a righteous thing with
God, to recompenÅ¿e tribulation to them
that trouble you, and to you which are
troubled, reÅ¿t with vs, when the Lord IeÅ¿us
Å¿hall Å¿hewe him Å¿elfe from heauen with
his mighty angels in flaming fire, rendring
vengeance vnto them that do not knowe
GOD, and which obey not the GoÅ¿pel of

our Lorde IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, which Å¿halbe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hed
with euerlaÅ¿ting perdition from the
preÅ¿ence of the Lord, and from the glorie
of his power:</hi> thus much for the wicked.
Now foloweth rewarde for the good, when
hee Å¿hall come the bee glorified in his Å¿aintes,
and to bee made marueylous in all them
that beleeue in that day. Here wee may haue
a notable diÅ¿courÅ¿e, as is in any place of
Å¿cripture, why our Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t Å¿hal come
to iudgement, both in reÅ¿pect of the good
and bad: yea, the wicked angels and Å¿pirites
them Å¿elues, as Iude Å¿aith, <hi>hee hath reÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in euerlaÅ¿ting chaines of darkeneÅ¿Å¿e,
vnto the iudgement of the great day.</hi> This
day is greatly deÅ¿ired and longed for of the
godly, and eÅ¿pecially of the true miniÅ¿ters
of ChriÅ¿tes GoÅ¿pell, that their cauÅ¿e may
bee knowen to bee good agaynÅ¿t the
wicked, and their Å¿ayings veryfied concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this iudgement: for Å¿urely there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
almoÅ¿t Å¿eene of God, or beleeued of
the wicked vntyll that day. Tell them of
this day, and terrifie them with it, they make
a mocke at it, they count them for fooles and
Å¿imple perÅ¿ons, that liue a godly and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian
life: but when this day commeth, (as
it will come certainly) it will make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb facs="tcp:10917:93"/>
for all, and they Å¿hall finde all
our Å¿ayings &amp; threatnings to be moÅ¿t true.
Therefore the godly deÅ¿ire it in reÅ¿pect of
Gods glorie chiefly, which the wicked haue
defaced. A great many of them thinke that
there is neyther hell nor heauen, God nor
Deuill, and that all are but fables that wee
Å¿peake of this day, and Å¿o they growe to an
vtter contempt of God and all godlines.
But (as the Lord liueth) they Å¿hall finde
it true by experience, which they woulde
not here embrace by fayth: yea, they Å¿hall
confeÅ¿Å¿e themÅ¿elues Å¿tarke fooles, and the
godlie men to bee wiÅ¿e in deede, WiÅ¿edome
5. ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us Å¿hall bee that great Lorde
and riche maÅ¿ter of the houÅ¿e, which Å¿hall
come to take an account of his Å¿eruantes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes
giuen vnto them to encreaÅ¿e and vÅ¿e
to his honour and glory, and to the good
and diligent Å¿eruauntes Å¿hall hee giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
and ioy, but to the vnprofitable Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes,
Å¿tripes and paine eternall. This
Å¿halbe the newe married bridegrome and
huÅ¿bande, which Å¿hall come to make a choiÅ¿e
of the wiÅ¿e and chaÅ¿te virgins, which haue
kept them Å¿elues pure vnto him, from the
fooliÅ¿he and vnchaÅ¿te, which haue defyled
them Å¿elues with the wicked worlde.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:94"/>
In that day ChriÅ¿t Å¿halbe that good and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
huÅ¿bandman, which Å¿hal come to gather
the wheate in the time of harueÅ¿t into his
barnes for his owne vÅ¿e, but Å¿hall burne
the chaffe with vnquenchable fire. And to
conclude, hee Å¿hall be that great Å¿hepheard
which Å¿hall diuide the lambes and Å¿heepe
from the goates, the one to Å¿itte on his right
hande in ioy, the other to Å¿itte on his lift
hande in Å¿orowe: to this ende no doubt Å¿hall
our Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿te come, and then Å¿hall it
be Å¿aide, O happie and thriÅ¿e happie was
hee that was a faithfull Å¿eruant, a chaÅ¿te vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to ChriÅ¿t, the good corne, the meeke
lambe of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. But this of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Å¿poken, then Å¿halbe too late, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
at that time Å¿halbe in vayne. I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ell
all men therefore that will not there
repent that euer they were borne, as the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Å¿hall doe, that they woulde in the name
of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿te, repent here betime, and
aÅ¿ke the Å¿pirite of the Lord to amende their
liues, that they put not off from day to day,
vntill they are olde, or haue all thinges as
they woulde. The Lorde will come Å¿udden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon Å¿uch an one, taking him away in
his Å¿inne. If wee woulde lay the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
of this iudgement day often before
<pb facs="tcp:10917:94"/>
our eyes, to Å¿turre vp our Å¿elues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and to awaken our dull Å¿pirites and
Å¿enÅ¿es, it woulde keepe vs in great feare
and awe before our Lorde GOD,
and drawe vs from much Å¿inne and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which nowe for lacke of thinking
vpon this day, is committed euery where,
both at home and abroade, as well in the
countrey and baÅ¿e mens houÅ¿es, as in the
court and great mens places. Well, wee
Å¿houlde doe as a godly father did in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
Church, that whether wee eate or
drynke, whether wee Å¿leepe or wake, or
whatÅ¿oeuer wee doe, wee Å¿houlde thinke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
this day to be at hande, and the voyce
Å¿ounding in our cares, ariÅ¿e yee dead and
come to iudgement. Notable of al others,
is that leÅ¿Å¿on that Solomon doth giue vnto
vs in the booke of the preacher, the 11 and
laÅ¿t Chapters, concerning this matter: hee
mocketh and derideth them that delite in
Å¿inne, as you Å¿ee men commonly doe, and
afterwarde threatneth and terrifieth them
with this laÅ¿t iudgement, Å¿aying, <hi>Reioyce
O young man in thy youth, and let thyne
heart cheare thee in the daies of thy youth,
and walke in the wayes of thy heart, and in
the Å¿ight of thine eies:</hi> Marke now what Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sowre
<pb facs="tcp:10917:95"/>
Å¿auce foloweth this Å¿weet meate: <hi>but
knowe,</hi> Å¿ayth hee, <hi>that for all theÅ¿e thinges,
GOD will bring thee to iudgement: for
God wil bring euery work into iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t,
&amp; euery Å¿ecret thing, whether it be good or
euill.</hi> A notable glaÅ¿Å¿e for all men to looke
vpon, is this finall iudgement. Wee are
taught by theÅ¿e thinges, that our felicitie
and pleaÅ¿ure conÅ¿iÅ¿teth not in this life, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can we haue it here, but it is in the lyfe
to come layde vp for vs in ChriÅ¿t. Here are
confuted all worldlings, which thinke there
is no other lyfe after this, no ioy or payne.
This day can not bee fearefull to the godly,
for it is called our bleÅ¿Å¿ed hope, Titus. 2.
and the godly doe loue it, 2. Timothie 4.
If it bee fearefull and terrible to any, as it
is, it is to thoÅ¿e that haue no hope of heauen,
and to thoÅ¿e that put their whole pleaÅ¿ure
and felicitie here belowe in their money
and ill gotten ryches. To the fearefull
and vnbeleeuyng, and the abominable, and
murderers, and whoremongers, and Å¿or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers,
and idolaters, and lyers, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
perÅ¿ons, this day Å¿hall bee fearefull
and terrible: yea, it Å¿hall make them all
to quake for feare, for they Å¿hall haue their
part in the lake that burneth with fyre
and brymÅ¿tone, which is the Å¿econde death,

Reuelation 21. This day and the cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof, Å¿erueth moÅ¿t fitly, to put men
in mynde of their dueties and callyngs
before the Lorde, for Å¿o our Sauiour
ChriÅ¿te applied it in his tyme in his GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
Å¿aying to them that were worldely
mynded, <hi>What Å¿hall it profite a man,
though he Å¿hould win the whole worlde,
if he loÅ¿e his owne Å¿oule, or what Å¿hall a
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> giue for recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce of his Å¿oule?</hi> marke
his reaÅ¿on, why it is dangerous, thus to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarde
and venture his Å¿oule: for, Å¿aith he, <hi>the
Å¿onne of man Å¿hal come in the glory of his
father with his angels, and then Å¿hall hee
giue to euery man according to his deedes,</hi>
Mat. 16. Å¿o doth Paul charge Timo. eÅ¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by this iudgement day, Å¿aying, <hi>I charge
thee before God, &amp; before the Lord IeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t, which Å¿hall iudge the quicke
and the dead at his appearing, and in his
kingdome, Preach the worde, be inÅ¿tant,
in Å¿eaÅ¿on and out of Å¿eaÅ¿on, improoue,
rebuke, exhort with al long Å¿uffering and
doctrine,</hi> 2. Timothie 4. As if hee Å¿houlde
Å¿ay in effect, There is a day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
kept in Å¿tore, therefore doe thy due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
diligently. This day of iudgement
Å¿hall make vs very carefull to Å¿hewe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:96"/>
foorth all good woorkes: For ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall
pronounce the definitiue Å¿entence vpon all
men according to their workes, not that the
godly haue deÅ¿erued or merited heauen by
their good workes, that is too great a thing
to bee gotten by woorkes: for ChriÅ¿t hath
already deÅ¿erued that for vs by his good
workes, if wee beleeue in him. But ChriÅ¿t
Å¿hall make mention of woorkes, to Å¿hewe
and to Å¿ignifie to all the worlde, that the
godly haue not beene idle or vnfruitfull in
this life, as the hypocrites are, whoÅ¿e Å¿heepe
Å¿kinnes then Å¿hall be plucked off, and then
Å¿hall they appeare to bee rauening wolues:
for this cauÅ¿e Å¿hall the iudgement bee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to workes, to Å¿turre men vp here, while
they heare this, to good works, and to make
manifeÅ¿t to al men, that the godly haue wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
innocently, and that the wicked haue
followed the luÅ¿ts of the fleÅ¿h. Our faith can
not be Å¿eene, and therfore ChriÅ¿t Å¿hal Å¿peake
according to the effect and conÅ¿equent of it,
which is Å¿eene, and that is good woorkes.
ChriÅ¿t before Å¿heweth the cauÅ¿e of heauen
for y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> elect, not their works, but becauÅ¿e they
were bleÅ¿Å¿ed of his father, and that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was prepared for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> before they were
borne, or did any good workes for it, <hi>yea,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:96"/>
before the fundations of the worlde were
layde,</hi> as Paul <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1, Å¿heweth moÅ¿t no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably.
Wherefore good ChriÅ¿tians, flee the
corruption which is in the worlde, and giue
great diligence to bring forth good works,
for thoÅ¿e are good and profitable vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
and Å¿o ye Å¿hall be knowen to bee good and
fruitfull trees. Ioyne moreouer vertue
with your faith, &amp; with vertue, knowledge,
with knowledge, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>perance, with te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce,
patience, with patience, godlines, with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,
brotherly kindneÅ¿Å¿e, &amp; with brotherly
kindnes, loue. For if theÅ¿e things be amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g
you, and abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>de, they wil make you that ye
neither Å¿hall be idle, nor vnfruitfull in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
of our Lorde IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t:
and he that hath not theÅ¿e things, is blinde,
and can not Å¿ee a farre off, and hath forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
that he was purged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> his olde Å¿innes.
Giue therefore diligence to make your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and election Å¿ure, for if ye doe theÅ¿e
things, ye Å¿hal neuer fal: for by this meanes
an entring Å¿hall be miniÅ¿tred vnto you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
into the euerlaÅ¿ting kingdome
of our Lord and Å¿auiour IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. We
haue heard nowe the Å¿ixe articles that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine
to the perÅ¿on of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and
conteine the benefites he hath wrought for
<pb facs="tcp:10917:97"/>
vs, wherein is our whole Å¿aluation. For if
we Å¿eeke Å¿aluation, his name IeÅ¿us, doeth
Å¿hewe it is in him alone. If we deÅ¿ire puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
it is in his conception. If we require a
kinde of familiaritie and gentlenes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he hath made him Å¿elfe like vnto vs,
we Å¿hall haue it in his natiuitie. WouldeÅ¿t
thou haue redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> for thy Å¿innes? looke
it in his paÅ¿Å¿ion and death. If newnes of
life, thou haÅ¿t it in his reÅ¿urrection. If inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of the heauenly kingdome, it is in
his aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion. If thou aÅ¿keÅ¿t a full poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion
of it, thou Å¿halt haue it when hee
commeth to iudgement. To be briefe, If
thou deÅ¿ireÅ¿t the giftes of the holy ghoÅ¿t,
abÅ¿olution, remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes, Å¿atiÅ¿faction,
and purgation for thy vnclennes, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
mortification of the fleÅ¿h, and at a
worde, all treaÅ¿ures of euery heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ly gift,
thou haÅ¿t them all in IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, as in a
well euer Å¿pringing, and a fountaine that
is neuer drie. Of whoÅ¿e fulnes thou and all
men haue receiued, and he is made of God
the father vnto thee, wiÅ¿edome, righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e,
holineÅ¿Å¿e, and redemption, that thou
Å¿houldeÅ¿t glorie in him alone<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Take heede
therefore, that Å¿eeing he is all in all to thee,
that thou goe not from him to any other,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:97"/>
or aÅ¿cribe any one part or portion, neuer Å¿o
litle, of thy Å¿aluation to any creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oeuer.
For if thou doe, thou marreÅ¿t all, &amp;
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t will haue all or neuer a whit,
as <hi>EÅ¿aie</hi> Å¿ayeth, <hi>I will not giue my glorie
to an other.</hi> Well, to conclude this
article, let vs giue to IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t moÅ¿t
humble and heartie thanks, that he wil one
day come downe from heauen, to fetche vs
vp thither vnto him, to immortall bleÅ¿Å¿ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e:
and let vs in the meane time deÅ¿ire of
him the Å¿pirit of patience, to wayte for his
comming to iudgement, for our full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
that we may haue our oyle, our
garmentes, and our lampes ready, that we
may be waking when he Å¿hall knocke, and
open the doore forthwith vnto him, that in
Å¿o doing, we may enter in with him to the
mariage, &amp; there raigne perpetually with
him in the glorie of his father. Which he

with the holy ghoÅ¿t, three perÅ¿ons, and one
immortall God in vnitie, bee rendred all

article of our beliefe: <hi>I beleeue in the holy
GhoÅ¿t,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, I that am a ChriÅ¿tian
man, do beleeue and truÅ¿t in God the holy
ghoÅ¿t, the third perÅ¿on in the bleÅ¿Å¿ed trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which proceedeth equally from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Å¿onne, being the naturall &amp; eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿entiall
power of them both, &amp; of the Å¿ame
Å¿ubÅ¿tance. Which Å¿pirite Å¿anctifieth &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth
me in all troubles, and aÅ¿Å¿ureth me
that I am the childe of God, and Å¿eruant of
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿hall haue his benefites
plentifully powred vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> me. Out of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
we learne two things, firÅ¿t, what is the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:98"/>
holy ghoÅ¿t, Å¿econdly, what are his effects &amp;
workes, as well in it Å¿elfe, as in man, in
whoÅ¿e heart it worketh, and moueth him
forward to that which is good, to imbrace
and followe it with all earneÅ¿tnes, but to
hate and abhorre from the heart, that which
is naught and wicked. This holy ghoÅ¿t or
Å¿pirit, is the euerlaÅ¿ting power and infinite
might of God the father, which Å¿pirite is
no creature but a creator of all things, and
very God, becauÅ¿e we are here taught to
beleue in him, which Å¿uerly except he were
very God, were idolatrie to do: for we muÅ¿t
not beleue in any creature, or put our truÅ¿t
in any, but in God onely. And that the holy
ghoÅ¿t is God, which certaine heretikes
haue denied, it is manifeÅ¿t in the fift chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>Actes</hi> of the ApoÅ¿tles, where
Å¿aint Peter Å¿peaking of the holy ghoÅ¿t, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
him God. For he reprehendeth <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi>
and <hi>Sapphira</hi> his wife, for their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criÅ¿y
and diÅ¿Å¿imulation, and telleth them
that they <hi>lyed vnto the holy ghoÅ¿t,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
after Å¿ayth, that <hi>they lyed not
vnto man, but vnto God.</hi> In the firÅ¿t
of <hi>GeneÅ¿is,</hi> it is Å¿ayde, that the <hi>Å¿pirite of
the Lorde moued vpon the waters.</hi> This
was the third perÅ¿on in trinitie, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb facs="tcp:10917:99"/>
he had bene God, could not haue Å¿o
moued vpon this great depth, and Å¿ecretly
by his power and maieÅ¿tie, preÅ¿erued and
maintained it from falling to nothing.
Dauid Å¿aieth, <hi>All things were made and
created by the breath of his mouth.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if he made al things, he was very God.
For this is proper to God alone, to make &amp;
to create things. That argument of Paul
in the 1. <hi>Cor. 2. chap.</hi> doth Å¿ufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tly proue
this matter vnto vs, where hee Å¿aieth, that
<hi>this Å¿pirit Å¿earcheth al things, yea y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deepe
things of God, and that no man knoweth
the things of God, but the Å¿pirit of God.</hi>
Now if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿pirit of God knoweth al things,
Å¿earcheth al things, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> is he very God, for
no creature doth this. If this be Å¿o, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> we
rightly beleeue in the holy ghoÅ¿t, &amp; here we
gather this Å¿ingular comfort, that we may
pray to this holy ghoÅ¿t at all times for his
helpe, &amp; to impart Å¿ome of his knowledge
vnto vs, becauÅ¿e he hath all knowledge and
vnderÅ¿tanding. This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine that we
gather generally of this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the holy ghoÅ¿t is
true &amp; very God. For verily, except he were
God, ChriÅ¿t would not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maunde his diÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<hi>to baptiÅ¿e in the name of the holy
ghoÅ¿t,</hi> putting him in equall condition and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:99"/>
eÅ¿tate with the father, and him Å¿elfe: Not
that we affirme that there be three Gods,
but this we meane: In the one and inÅ¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
diuine nature and eÅ¿Å¿ence of God, we
vnderÅ¿tand three perÅ¿ons by them Å¿elues,
diÅ¿tinct one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> another. But this miÅ¿tery
of the trinitie, may better be beleeued (and
Å¿o it is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfull) then fitly expreÅ¿Å¿ed of
any. I leaue it therefore, to Å¿peake any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of it vntill in the reÅ¿urrection, we Å¿hall
Å¿ee it as it is, and perceiue that by Å¿ight, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
face to face, which nowe wee conceiue by
our fayth onely. Thus much of the holy
ghoÅ¿t, the third perÅ¿on in this trinitie. Now
let vs conÅ¿ider the wonderfull effectes of
it, which is a thing more profitable for vs.
The effectes of the holy ghoÅ¿t, are of two
Å¿ortes: eyther as they are conÅ¿idered in
him Å¿elfe, or as they are in the children of
God: the effects of the holy ghoÅ¿t in him
Å¿elfe, are the creation of the worlde, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eruation
of it with al things therein, from
the beginning vnto this day. Wherein we
learne to giue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>kes to this holy Å¿pirit, for
his goodnes extended vnto vs, &amp; to pray to
him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tinually to mainteine vs by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
&amp; vertue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we fall not away from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10917:100"/>
For if hee take away his Å¿trength and
operation from vs, wee are as blynde men
groping for the waye. And this is that, that
Dauid Å¿peaketh of in his <hi>PÅ¿alme 104. If
thou hide thy face, they are troubled,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
all his creatures. Agayne, <hi>If thou
Å¿ende foorth thy Å¿pirite, they are created,
and thou renueÅ¿t the face of the earth.</hi> But
our purpoÅ¿e is eÅ¿pecially to Å¿peake here of
thoÅ¿e good giftes and effectes, which this
holy Å¿pirite doeth worke in men, chiefly in
the elect. For there is no man, but hath
had Å¿ome good gifte at one time, or an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
either in body or in Å¿oule, from this
holy Å¿pirit. For Å¿trength, beauty, learning,

theÅ¿e are common, as well to the
ill and reprobate, as to the good and elect
Å¿onnes of God, as Paul doth Å¿hewe, and
declare more at large in the 12. 13. <hi>&amp; 18.
chapters of the 1. Corinthians.</hi> Our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is to Å¿peake chiefly of the graces of
Gods Å¿pirite in the hearts of his choÅ¿en,
as of fayth, hope, and loue vnfayned, of the
Å¿pirit of Å¿anctification and adoption, which
are proper only to the elect and good, &amp; are
<pb facs="tcp:10917:100"/>
neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>municated to the wicked. Of this
Å¿pirit Å¿pake our Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t to his diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
that he would Å¿ende him vpon them,
and that the world could not receyue him.
This is that Å¿pirit, by whome the father
doeth place, and put the elect in ful poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the goodes and inheritance of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us
ChriÅ¿t, and doeth keepe and preÅ¿erue
vs euery houre, and doeth make vs parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of all thinges neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Å¿aluation,
which thing it bringeth to paÅ¿Å¿e, when as it
doeth create in our heartes and beget y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
inÅ¿trument of faith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefeÅ¿t worke
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿pirit, which bringeth foorth as a moÅ¿t
fruitefull tree, all other good fruites and
workes of a ChriÅ¿tia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> man. This faith doth
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoÅ¿t ingender in our heartes, when
we heare the GoÅ¿pel of ChriÅ¿t preached: &amp;
it is confirmed &amp; encreaÅ¿ed in vs, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duely
and reuerent receiuing of the Å¿acraments
of ChriÅ¿t. By this faith (after it is wrought
in vs by the motion and operation of
the holy Å¿pirite, wee apprehend and take
holde of all ChriÅ¿tes benefites, merites,
works, and good deedes whatÅ¿oeuer, and
they are made &amp; accounted ours, as if wee
had done them our Å¿elues. O wonderfull
gift of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoÅ¿t, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worketh Å¿o precious a

This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firÅ¿t effect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoÅ¿t, &amp;
is marueilous in our eies. An other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
&amp; effect of this holy Å¿pirit, is Å¿anctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; holines of life, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good &amp; godly only,
&amp; therfore he is called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Å¿pirit, for this
worke of holines in vs. For as it is proper
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father to create, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿onne to redeeme
and ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿ome: Å¿o in like Å¿ort it is proper and

childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, &amp; effectually to moue their mindes
to true holineÅ¿Å¿e. And of this effect doth <hi>S.
Paul</hi> Å¿peake in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. Å¿hewing the
Corinthians that they <hi>were wicked men,
as fornicatours, idolatours, extortioners,
couetous, theeues &amp; Å¿uch like, but</hi> (Å¿aith he)
<hi>you are waÅ¿hed, but you are Å¿a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ctified, but
ye are iuÅ¿tified in the name of the Lorde
IeÅ¿us, and by the Å¿pirite of our God.</hi> As
if we would Å¿ay, thoÅ¿e good graces &amp; gifts
of God were wrought &amp; imprinted in their
conÅ¿ciences &amp; hearts, by the perÅ¿uaÅ¿ion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
holy ghoÅ¿t. NeceÅ¿Å¿arily therfore, after our
beleefe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿onne, followeth our
beleefe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoÅ¿t: For whatÅ¿oeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

As we Å¿ee the writing to be to no effect,

and want of this Å¿pirite in other men, wee
may eaÅ¿ily Å¿ee what a benefite we haue by
him, to keepe and defende vs Å¿o mercifully
euery houre, in all our waies and actions of
our life. If this Å¿pirit leaue vs neuer Å¿o litle

miÅ¿cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ces and euils, as we Å¿ee in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es
a Å¿ingular man, being left to his owne

to doubt and diÅ¿truÅ¿t of the power of
the Lorde, whether he were able to doe all
thinges or no, as to bring water out of the

being Å¿ixe hundred thouÅ¿and men, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
Å¿pace, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. &amp; 20. So Dauid,
being not vpholden with this Å¿pirit, and left
to his owne will, fell by and by to adulterie
and murther. We had neede therefore to
pray continually to IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, the giuer
of this Å¿pirite, that we may haue him with
vs to direct our liues, &amp; make them accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

other effects that it hath, is compared in the
Scriptures to water, to oyle, to fire, to

<pb facs="tcp:10917:105"/>
both in the newe and olde TeÅ¿tament, as in
EÅ¿a. 44. where the Lord Å¿ayth, <hi>I wil powre

this water and dry grounde, he afterwarde

my bleÅ¿Å¿ing vpon thy buddes.</hi> In the newe
TeÅ¿tament our Sauiour Å¿ayth, <hi>If any man
thirÅ¿t, let him come vnto me and drinke:
he that beleeueth in me, as Å¿ayth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
out of his belly Å¿hall flowe riuers of
waters of life.</hi> And that he meant this of the
Å¿pirit, Iohn immediately declareth, Å¿aying,
<hi>This Å¿pake he of the Å¿pirit, which they that
beleeued in him, Å¿hould receiue, Iohn</hi> 7. As
water therfore doeth cleanÅ¿e and purifie the
filthie and vncleane in bodie being waÅ¿hed
with it, &amp; is very neceÅ¿Å¿ary for our life here:
Å¿o doeth this holy Å¿pirit of God much more
cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿e &amp; purifie our Å¿oules fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the infection &amp;
filthines of Å¿inne, as Ezechiel fitly applieth
it: <hi>I will powre cleane water vpon you, &amp;
ye Å¿hall be cleane, yea from all your filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
&amp; from al your idoles wil I clenÅ¿e you.</hi>
And Å¿o by and by Å¿ayth, <hi>I will put my Å¿pirit
within you, Ezech.</hi> 36. Of this pure water
Å¿peaketh the ApoÅ¿tle to the Hebr. 10. chap.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:105"/>
This Å¿pirit is moreouer likened to oyle, for
the Å¿upplenes &amp; gentlenes that is in it, &amp; in
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that haue it, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 45. To fire alÅ¿o is this
Å¿pirit compared, as we reade in <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. &amp;
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. For ChriÅ¿t <hi>Å¿hal baptize with fire,</hi> as
Iohn Å¿aith: which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy GhoÅ¿t. For euen
as fire doeth conÅ¿ume, Å¿coure, purge &amp; giue
light: Å¿o no doubt doeth the holy Å¿pirite of
God conÅ¿ume the wicked, Å¿coure our filth,
purge our Å¿innes, &amp; inlighten our ignorant
hearts, as Paul Å¿aith, <hi>AriÅ¿e thou that Å¿lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peÅ¿t,
&amp; ChriÅ¿t Å¿hal giue thee light, Ephe. 5.
Lift thou vp the light of thy cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
vs, PÅ¿al.</hi> 4. Thirdly it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pared to a great &amp;
mighty winde, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. For as windes doe
purge &amp; make wholÅ¿ome y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aire from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tagiouÅ¿nes: Å¿o doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿pirit work
in the hearts of his, this purging from their
old corruption &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tagion of Å¿inne by Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
and regenerateth and renueth vs againe by
the <hi>immortall Å¿eede of the worde, 1. Pet.</hi> 2.
whereby we are <hi>borne anewe, that we may
enter into the kingdome of heauen, Ioh.</hi> 3.
The Å¿pirite of God is alÅ¿o likened vnto a
winde in this reÅ¿pect: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as nothing is able
to reÅ¿iÅ¿t or withÅ¿tand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force of great whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>windes,
but they beare down before them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
thing that Å¿ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>deth againÅ¿t the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, whether
<pb facs="tcp:10917:106"/>
it be trees, houÅ¿es, caÅ¿tels or towres: Å¿o it is
with the Å¿pirit of God, whom no creature is
able to withÅ¿tande or reÅ¿iÅ¿t, but muÅ¿t needes
fall vnder it, and which deÅ¿troyeth euery hie
thing, which is exalted againÅ¿t the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, caÅ¿ting downe Å¿trong holdes,
and the imaginations of mighty Princes, &amp;
bringeth into captiuitie euery thought to
the obedience of ChriÅ¿t, and hath ready ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
againÅ¿t all diÅ¿obedience. This thing
may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>firmed by diuers examples, eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by that of the enchaunters and Å¿orce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of Egypt, when they were compelled
to Å¿aye, that this was the finger of God, to
bring lyce out of the duÅ¿t, &amp; that they coulde
not doe the like: the Å¿pirite of God Å¿o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
their wiÅ¿dome and Å¿orcerie, <hi>Exo.</hi> 8.
Other mo examples might be brought, but
I paÅ¿Å¿e them ouer, and leaue them to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
readers of the Å¿criptures, where they
Å¿hall finde Å¿tore of them. Fourthly this holy
Å¿pirite is likened <hi>to a doue,</hi> as we reade of
in the 3. of <hi>Matthewe,</hi> deÅ¿cending downe
from heauen, &amp; lighting vpon our Å¿auiour.
He is compared to a doue, for theÅ¿e quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and properties, which are meekeneÅ¿Å¿e
and gentleneÅ¿Å¿e: for this Å¿pirite doeth cauÅ¿e
them to put off anger and wrath, in whome
<pb facs="tcp:10917:106"/>
it abideth, and to vÅ¿e brotherly kindenes one
to another. And the doue is Å¿ayd to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
gall, and very chaÅ¿te: Å¿o is this Å¿pirite
without all bitternes in the heartes of them
whome it doeth poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e, and teacheth them
to kÃ©epe their veÅ¿Å¿els in all puritie and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e
of life, and not in luÅ¿t of concupiÅ¿cence
as the wicked doe, which knowe not God.
For this Å¿pirit is called the Å¿pirite of Å¿ancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
of cleanneÅ¿Å¿e, of innocencie. If this
be Å¿o, that this holy Å¿pirite is cleane &amp; pure,
and likened to a doue: and furthermore our
bodies are Å¿aid to be the Temples and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es
of the holy GhoÅ¿t, which dwelleth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
vs, as Paul Å¿ayeth, <hi>Knowe ye not, that
your body is the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ple of the holy GhoÅ¿t?</hi>
1. <hi>Corinth. 3. &amp; 6. 2. Cor.</hi> 6. Seeing this is
Å¿o, we muÅ¿t prepare our houÅ¿es, and Å¿weepe
them cleane, to entertaine Å¿o honourable a
gheÅ¿t. If this houÅ¿e which is our body, be
vncleane, &amp; giuen to any vice, then Å¿urely,
as doues depart from filthy houÅ¿es: Å¿o this
moÅ¿t louing and moÅ¿t gentle doue, the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of God departeth foorthwith from vs,
and then we are in a moÅ¿t miÅ¿erable caÅ¿e,
yea God will deÅ¿troye him, that deÅ¿troyeth
this his holy temple. Seeing then (dearely
beloued) our bodies are the temples of the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:107"/>
holy GhoÅ¿t, and we haue Å¿uch promiÅ¿es that
he will dwell in them, if they be holy, and
threates that they Å¿halbe deÅ¿troyed, if they
be giuen ouer to Å¿inne and wantonneÅ¿Å¿e: let
vs, I praye you, cleanÅ¿e our Å¿elues from all
filthines of the fleÅ¿h and Å¿pirit, and finiÅ¿h our
Å¿anctification in the feare of God, putting
off the workes of darkenes, and putting on
the armour of light, and let vs walke ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿tly,
as in the daye time, and make proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion
to receyue this holy Å¿pirite into our
hearts. You knowe what great preparation
you make both in your houÅ¿es, and in your
bodies, to haue your apparel neate &amp; cleane,
if you be to entertayne a Prince, a noble
man, or any worÅ¿hipfull friende of yours:
then conÅ¿ider with your Å¿elues, that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
care and diligence is to be had by tenne
thouÅ¿and partes, to lodge and receyue into
your houÅ¿es the Prince of princes, euen the
holy GhoÅ¿t, the power of God. And Å¿eeing
he will vouchÅ¿afe to abide with you, &amp; take
your preparation in good woorth, firÅ¿t giue
him thankes for this his Å¿o vnÅ¿peakeable
courteÅ¿ie and kindeneÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿o vÅ¿e and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
your Å¿elues, as he may long continue
with you, to your great good and comfort,
&amp; grieue not this holy Å¿pirite of God, (by
<pb facs="tcp:10917:107"/>
whome ye are Å¿ealed vnto the day of rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,)
by your corrupt communication pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
out of your mouthes: and Å¿eeing he
will be content to tarry with you, and make
his abode in your houÅ¿es, let all bitternes,
and anger, and wrath, and euill Å¿peaking be
put farre away from you, with all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e.
For Å¿urely if theÅ¿e thinges be among
vs, he will depart from vs, and then he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs to our owne willes. This can not
bee but a great griefe of minde, for if our
friende Å¿houlde goe away from vs, by our
vncourteous dealing and vÅ¿ing of him, we
woulde be Å¿ory: much more Å¿houlde we be
Å¿orie, when Å¿uch a friende departeth and
leaueth our companie, becauÅ¿e we are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to vice and naughtineÅ¿Å¿e, whoÅ¿e pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence
was all ioye, and whoÅ¿e abÅ¿ence from
vs, is extreme miÅ¿erie and curÅ¿edneÅ¿Å¿e.
Wherefore as this Å¿pirite was obtayned by
the meanes of prayer, Å¿o is he kept and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erued
with vs by earneÅ¿t prayer, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the worde, and other Å¿uch godly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciÅ¿es
of the ChriÅ¿tians, in which they are
commanded to walke in. For the fruite of
the Å¿pirite is in all goodneÅ¿Å¿e, righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e,
and trueth, approouing that which is
<pb facs="tcp:10917:108"/>
acceptable and pleaÅ¿ing the Lord. And here
is another effect woorthie the nothing, that
this holy GhoÅ¿t inhabiting within the elect
and children of God, doeth make now their
workes and labours to be acceptable vnto
him, which before his comming vnto vs,
were abominable &amp; vnpleaÅ¿ant vnto God:
not that our good works deÅ¿erue any thing
at his handes, but becauÅ¿e we are ingraffed
vnto ChriÅ¿t by the Å¿eale of his Å¿pirit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that which was ill in vs before, is nowe
made good and accepted, as if it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
yea through this Å¿pirite, which doeth Å¿o
Å¿eaÅ¿on inwardly our actions, that they are
liked of God, we become thereby not onely
his faithfull Å¿eruants, &amp; deare friends, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
which is much more, his welbeloued Å¿o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>nes,
as Paul Å¿heweth vnto vs, <hi>BecauÅ¿e ye are
Å¿onnes, God hath Å¿ent foorth the Å¿pirite of
his Sonne into your hearts, which cryeth,
Father, father. Wherfore thou art no more
a Å¿eruant, but a Å¿onne. Nowe if thou bee a
Å¿onne, thou art alÅ¿o y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heire of god through
ChriÅ¿t.</hi> If this be Å¿o, that we be made the
Å¿onnes of God, and haue receiued the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of children by this holy Å¿pirite: then we
may aÅ¿Å¿ure our Å¿elues of Å¿aluation, vnleÅ¿Å¿e
the obedient childe may doubt of the good
<pb facs="tcp:10917:108"/>
will of his louing father. Here then falleth
to the ground the doctrine of the PapiÅ¿tes,
that teach men to doubt and Å¿tande in feare
of their Å¿aluation. For is not this a very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urd
and a fooliÅ¿h PoÅ¿ition, that they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne,
that we may call God Father, and
yet doubt, whether he will beÅ¿towe the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of children vpon vs? Shall I call
him father, and doubt of this? For theÅ¿e are
the wordes of the holy GhoÅ¿t, vttered by S.
Paul, <hi>That the Å¿pirite of God witneÅ¿Å¿eth
with our Å¿pirite, that we are the Å¿onnes of
God.</hi> This being Å¿o, marke what Paul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
&amp; bringeth in vpon this poynt, <hi>If we
be childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, we are alÅ¿o heires, euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heires
of God, and heires annexed with IeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t.</hi> Shall I now be made &amp; appoynted
an heire by good &amp; Å¿ufficient warrant of the
holy GhoÅ¿t, which lyeth not, nor deceyueth,
and yet doubt of my inheritance? that were
a mad thing. Can the Å¿eruant doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be his maÅ¿ters man, or Å¿hall receyue
his wages, when he weareth his maÅ¿ters
coate and cogniÅ¿ance? or can one doubt of
the writing to be authentical and good, that
hath the parties hande and Å¿eale vnto it? Or
may a man doubt, hauing receiued earneÅ¿t
in part of payment, but that he Å¿hall in tyme
<pb facs="tcp:10917:109"/>
conuenient haue the whole, hauing bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with an houeÅ¿t man? Or doe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
the witneÅ¿Å¿e of honeÅ¿t men of credite
nere in matters politicall, and Å¿hall not we
receyue the witneÅ¿Å¿e of God the Father, the
Sonne, and the holy GhoÅ¿t, which is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and more to bee beleeued of vs, when
hee promiÅ¿eth Å¿aluation to the beleeuers?
Surely if we doubt, then we haue not faith:
for <hi>he that doubteth, is not grounded in
the faith, but is like a waue of the Å¿ea, toÅ¿t
of the winde, and caryed away, Iames</hi> 1.
How can I haue hope of Å¿aluation, as I am
commaunded, and yet be in deÅ¿paire of it,
and doubt with my Å¿elfe? A man can not
hope for that, whereof he doubteth. Doeth
not Saint Iohn Å¿ay playnely, <hi>We knowe
that we are tranÅ¿lated from death to life,
becauÅ¿e we loue the brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>?</hi> He Å¿aith not,
We doubt of it. And againe, <hi>Hereby we
knowe that he abideth in vs, euen by his
Å¿pirit which he hath giuen vs.</hi> And all this
aÅ¿Å¿urance commeth to paÅ¿Å¿e by the teÅ¿timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
and witneÅ¿Å¿e of this holie Å¿pirite, which
therefore is called the Å¿eale of God, the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿t
penie, the Å¿pirite of trueth, which can
not deceyue, or be deceyued. And here I
can not but maruayle at the ignorance and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:109"/>
blindeneÅ¿Å¿e of the PapiÅ¿ts, which while they
go about to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h this doctrine of error,
they impugne and ouerthrowe another of
their owne. For they Å¿aye, that a man may
fulfill the Lawe of God perfitly: nay they
go further, and Å¿ay, he may fulfil the Lawe,
and doe all that God hath commaunded in
his worde written, and more to, which are
workes of Å¿upererogation beÅ¿ides, which he
hath not commaunded, (and Å¿o in deede he
hath not,) and theÅ¿e workes the Monkes
and Friers doe beÅ¿towe vpon their friendes
which lacke them, for they haue ynough for
themÅ¿elues, and theÅ¿e they Å¿ell to others,
which are the ouerplus, and they call them
the Å¿tore of the Church. Nowe thus Å¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the caÅ¿e. If they keepe the Lawe, then
they neede not doubt, but that God wil giue
them the rewarde of it, which is life and Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation:
and why then doe they doubt, if it
be true? they fulfill the commandementes:
then let them not diÅ¿truÅ¿t of their wages
and hire. Wherefore one of theÅ¿e two muÅ¿t
needes follow: If they keepe the Lawe,
then they neede not doubt of life. If they
doubt of Å¿aluation, then it is certaine they
keepe not the Lawe. In one of theÅ¿e two
they muÅ¿t needes bee founde lyers by their
<pb facs="tcp:10917:110"/>
owne confeÅ¿Å¿ion. But in deede they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
in both of them: for it is falÅ¿e, that they
keepe the Lawe, which is a yoke that can
not be borne of any man, except ChriÅ¿t, Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is Å¿piritual, &amp; biddeth vs not to Å¿inne,
neyther in deede, neither in worde, no not Å¿o
much as once in thought, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. And the
other is as falÅ¿e, that we Å¿hould doubt of our
Å¿aluation. But in deede the firÅ¿t author of
this doctrine, the Pope himÅ¿elfe, out of
whoÅ¿e Å¿hop it came, that great AntichriÅ¿t,
and a man of all abominations that euer
were, might well teache this doctrine, and
doubt of his Å¿aluation, liuing (as he doth) in
filthy fornication with his CurtiÅ¿anes and
harlots at Rome, Å¿turring vp ChriÅ¿tian
Princes to warre one with another, to
mainteyne his vnÅ¿atiable ambition, pride, &amp;
couetouÅ¿nes, with all maner of wickednes:
Mouing likewiÅ¿e the Å¿ubiectes to rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t
their lawful and natural princes and
magiÅ¿trates, diÅ¿charging the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of their othes
and obedience vnto their rulers. I Å¿aye, he
that doeth theÅ¿e things, and worÅ¿e, may wel
doubt of his Å¿aluation: for he hath nothing
to do in the kingdom of God. And Å¿o all his
adherents, folowing his Å¿teppes &amp; religion,
whoÅ¿e liues are altogether moÅ¿t filthie and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:110"/>
wicked, may be in the Å¿ame caÅ¿e and Å¿tate
with their holy father the Pope. But they
Å¿ay, We can by no meanes be Å¿ure of our
Å¿aluation, becauÅ¿e we can not be Å¿ure of our
perÅ¿euerance in the faith of ChriÅ¿t vnto the
ende. But this is vtterly falÅ¿e: for the Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Å¿ayth, that the godly Å¿hall continue and
perÅ¿euere vnto the ende. Paul was Å¿ure
that he had the Å¿pirit of God, and that cauÅ¿ed
him to be perÅ¿waded, that neyther thinges
preÅ¿ent, neither things to come Å¿houlde be
able to Å¿eparate him from the loue of God,
which is in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us our Lorde. Then
we may be Å¿ure, that thinges to come Å¿hall
not remoue vs from God. Againe, the loue
of God is conÅ¿tant and perfite, <hi>and whom
he once loueth, he loueth with an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting
loue, euen vnto the ende,</hi> as ChriÅ¿t is
Å¿ayde to loue his, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. And to whome
God hath giuen this Å¿pirite of adoption, as
he doeth to the Elect, he neuer taketh it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
but is Å¿til a teÅ¿timonie vnto their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ciences,
that they Å¿halbe Å¿aued in the ende,
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tinue in the meane Å¿eaÅ¿on in the faith
and obedience of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us their Lorde.
Yea Paul is perÅ¿uaded of the Philippians,
(and Å¿o muÅ¿t we be of our Å¿elues) <hi>that he
that hath begunne a good worke in vs, wil
<pb facs="tcp:10917:111"/>
performe it vntill the day of the Lord IeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t, Philip.</hi> 1. And he hath the like to the
Corinthians, that <hi>God wil confirme them
vnto the ende, 1. Cor.</hi> 1. And they that are
elected, Å¿hal continue: <hi>For the giftes and
calling of God are without repentance,
Rom.</hi> 11. S. Iohn a man beloued of IeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t, and to be beleeued before our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aries,
doubted not to Å¿ay and affirme for a
trueth, in his Å¿econde EpiÅ¿tle to a vertuous
Lady, that <hi>the trueth which dwelleth in
vs, Å¿halbe with vs for euer.</hi> If it Å¿hal remaine
with vs for euer, how Å¿hould we doubt, that
it can forÅ¿ake vs at any time, either preÅ¿ent
or to come? <hi>Proue your Å¿elues,</hi> Å¿ayth Paul,
<hi>whether ye are in the faith: examine your
Å¿elues: knowe ye not your owne Å¿elues,
that IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is in you, except ye be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probats?</hi>
Here he wil haue vs to be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perÅ¿waded, that ChriÅ¿t dwelleth in vs, &amp;
Å¿o to be Å¿ure of Å¿aluation, vnleÅ¿Å¿e we will be
counted reprobates, which God forbid. If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
PapiÅ¿ts wil be counted reprobates, let them
then doubt of their Å¿aluation: if not, then let
them recant, &amp; be aÅ¿Å¿ured of it with vs, and
amend their religion and maners Å¿peedily.
Neyther is this doctrine, as Å¿ome ignorant
perÅ¿ons terme it, a doctrine of raÅ¿hneÅ¿Å¿e and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:111"/>
preÅ¿umptuouÅ¿nes, vnles Gods worde teach
vs preÅ¿umption. But this is a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
doctrine, as at all times, Å¿o eÅ¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
at the houre of death, when our conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
doe accuÅ¿e vs, and Satan aÅ¿Å¿ault vs,
and the paynes of death come vpon vs: (I
Å¿aye) this doeth comfort weake and feeble
conÅ¿ciences not to deÅ¿paire, and the other
doctrine of theirs doeth leade men the hye
way to deÅ¿peration, to doubt whether they
Å¿hall be Å¿aued or no. They Å¿aye, we muÅ¿t
feare. It is true: but not feare to bee dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
For <hi>there is no damnation to them
that are in ChriÅ¿t, which walke not after
the fleÅ¿h, but after the Å¿pirit, Rom.</hi> 8. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
muÅ¿t this feare bee without faith and
hope: for then it is a Å¿lauiÅ¿h feare of the
whippe and Å¿courge, and not a childes
feare, to feare to diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e his louing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Wee muÅ¿t then haue the feare of
Å¿onnes, not of hired Å¿eruantes, to feare to
offende and diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e Å¿o mercifull and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a Father, and not to feare and doubt
of our Å¿aluation: for it Å¿tandeth not in vs,
but in a Å¿urer rocke and grounde, which is
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t: and if we beleeue in him, we
Å¿hall haue euerlaÅ¿ting life, <hi>Iohn 3. Act.</hi> 17.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:112"/>
And yet here we muÅ¿t take heede of another
extremitie, which the <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿alians</hi> certaine
heretikes, with the <hi>Libertines, AnabaptiÅ¿ts,</hi>
&amp; that wicked Å¿ect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

into: for all theÅ¿e preÅ¿ume too much of
this Å¿pirit of God, and of their reuelations,
becauÅ¿e they ioyne not the Å¿pirite of God
with his word, but Å¿eparate it from the word
of ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿o it is but a fayned Å¿pirite of
their own fantaÅ¿tical braynes, and not from
God. Nowe as the PapiÅ¿tes take too litle,
Å¿o theÅ¿e men take too much, and whatÅ¿oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contemne the outwarde worde and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the GoÅ¿pel, with the adminiÅ¿trati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Sacraments, whereas we knowe
that the Å¿pirite goeth, and is giuen by the
miniÅ¿terie of the worde, and is ioyned with
it, as <hi>Acts.</hi> 10. we reade, that <hi>while Peter
Å¿pake the worde, the holy ghoÅ¿t fell on all
them that heard the preaching,</hi> not before
the worde came: for ChriÅ¿t giueth not
his Å¿pirit, but by the hearing of his GoÅ¿pell
firÅ¿t preached, as Paul Å¿ayde to the EpheÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<hi>After ye heard the worde of trueth,
the GoÅ¿pel of your Å¿aluation, wherein alÅ¿o
<pb facs="tcp:10917:112"/>
after that ye beleeued, ye were Å¿ealed with
the holy Spirite of promiÅ¿e, EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1. Here
we Å¿ee, if any would pretend the Å¿pirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the worde, he may bee refuted: for they
goe both together, the worde of trueth with
the Å¿pirite of promiÅ¿e. For it is not our part
to diÅ¿Å¿euer, or diÅ¿ioyne thoÅ¿e two things,
which God will haue coupled together in
one. And therefore the Prophetes, which
myght better haue vÅ¿ed this prerogatiue of
the Å¿pirit then they, called alwayes the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to the worde of the Lorde God, Å¿aying,
<hi>Heare the word of the Lord, Thus Å¿ayeth
the Lord:</hi> and Å¿till, <hi>The mouth of the Lord
hath Å¿poken it, EÅ¿ay</hi> 1. They pretende not
the Å¿pirit without the worde, although they
Å¿peake moÅ¿t plentifully by him, 2. EpiÅ¿t. of
Peter 1. Chapter. <hi>For the prophecie came
not in olde time by the will of man: but
holy men of God Å¿pake as they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the holy GhoÅ¿t.</hi> Furthermore ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
effecte of this Spirite is to moue
the heart of man, when the worde is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
vnto him: for vnleÅ¿Å¿e Gods Spirite
perÅ¿wade and worke in our heartes within,
when the preacher Å¿oundeth in our eares the
outward word, he Å¿hal but Å¿peake as it were
in the ayre, &amp; beate the eare of man in vaine.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:113"/>
Paul well conÅ¿idering this, Å¿ayde, <hi>that he
in deed had planted, and Apollos</hi> another
preacher <hi>had watered the worde, but it is
God</hi> (Å¿ayeth he) <hi>that giueth the increaÅ¿e.
And wee knowe that God woorketh all
things in the heartes of his children by this
Å¿pirite, wherewith hee Å¿ealeth them after
they haue heard and beleeued the worde
preached, Ephe.</hi> 1. and therfore in the place
aboue recited, this Å¿pirit is called the <hi>Å¿pirit
of promiÅ¿e,</hi> becauÅ¿e it doeth aÅ¿Å¿ertaine and
aÅ¿Å¿ure vs of all the bleÅ¿Å¿inges and promiÅ¿es
of God that are made vnto vs. In the
Actes it is Å¿ayde, that <hi>Lydia a woman
being a Å¿eller of purple, came to heare
Paul preach the GoÅ¿pel:</hi> but marke what
Saint Luke Å¿aieth, <hi>whoÅ¿e heart</hi> (Å¿ayeth
he) <hi>the Lord opened, that Å¿hee attended
to the things which Paul Å¿pake:</hi> So that
except God open our cloÅ¿ed and hard Å¿hutte
hearts, by the Å¿ecret inÅ¿piration of this holy
Å¿pirite, in vayne Å¿hall we eyther preach, or
the people heare. We haue neede then all of
vs (before we come to heare his word) pray
to God to giue vs grace to perceyue &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand
his will and myÅ¿teries, &amp; to Å¿often
our Å¿tony hearts, that they may receiue the
worde, and to circumciÅ¿e our eares to heare
<pb facs="tcp:10917:113"/>
it. This it that Dauid Å¿ayde, <hi>O Lord open
thou mine eyes, that I may Å¿ee the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
things of thy Lawe:</hi> and againe, <hi>O
giue me vnderÅ¿tanding, &amp; I wil keepe thy
Lawe.</hi> Now Dauid knewe very well that
all theÅ¿e things were done by the operation
of Gods Å¿pirite, as Paul Å¿ayeth, <hi>The Å¿pirit
hath reuealed theÅ¿e things vnto vs, 1. Cor.
2. for it is hee that helpeth all our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Rom.</hi> 8. This is the marke whereby
God doeth Å¿eale and print in the forehead, to
be Å¿eene of all men, thoÅ¿e that are his, and
without the which no man can truely aÅ¿Å¿ure
him Å¿elfe that he belongeth vnto ChriÅ¿t: for
as the Å¿ame ApoÅ¿tle witneÅ¿Å¿eth, <hi>If any man
haue not the Spirite of ChriÅ¿t, the Å¿ame
is none of his.</hi> Nowe how greatly this holy
Å¿pirit is to be deÅ¿ired of all of vs, there is no
man that hath read the Scriptures, but well
vnderÅ¿tandeth. This made EliÅ¿eus, a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
man, the Å¿choler of Elias, when his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter
bad him to aÅ¿ke of him what he would,
that he might do it for him before he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away from him into heauen, that he aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<hi>his Å¿pirite to bee doubled vpon him,</hi>
whereby he might the better Å¿erue the Lord
and his Church in his vocation and calling,
2. King. 2. and Å¿o by this Å¿pirit he wrought
<pb facs="tcp:10917:114"/>
wonderful miracles, and did much good by
it to the whole kingdome of IÅ¿rael. Wee
Å¿ee by this petition of this notable father &amp;
godly man, what we alÅ¿o Å¿houlde eÅ¿pecially
deÅ¿ire of God in our prayers: not riches or
wealth Å¿o much, which al do periÅ¿h, but this
holy Å¿pirite which liueth &amp; remaineth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
in them that haue him, and can neuer be
loÅ¿t or taken away. And this is the Å¿elf Å¿ame
thing that our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t would haue
vs to aÅ¿ke in our praiers of God his father:
for Å¿peaking of praier to his diÅ¿ciples, he Å¿he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
that God his Father is moÅ¿t ready to
giue vs our requeÅ¿ts, as Å¿oone as we aÅ¿ke of
him: as our earthly father is willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tow
that vpon vs which he is able to giue.
And of all other things that God giueth, he
maketh mention of this Å¿pirit, Å¿aying, <hi>If ye
which are euill, can giue good giftes vnto
your children, how much more Å¿hall your
heauenly Father giue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy GhoÅ¿t to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
that deÅ¿ire him? Luk.</hi> 11. Signifying this
Spirite to be the excellenteÅ¿t gift that God
coulde giue, or we deÅ¿ire of him. We haue
nowe heard the meaning of this article, <hi>of
the holy GhoÅ¿t,</hi> what it is, and what are
the wonderfull and comfortable effectes of
it in the Church, and howe the Lorde hath
<pb facs="tcp:10917:114"/>
promiÅ¿ed neuer to leaue his deÅ¿titute of it
vnto the worlds ende: We haue Å¿eene alÅ¿o
howe we muÅ¿t beleeue in him, as the true
and euerlaÅ¿ting God, equally proceeding
from the Father and the Sonne, becauÅ¿e he
is the power and vertue, whereby they doe
worke and create all things. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this heauenly Å¿pirit is Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿arie and
Å¿o great a treaÅ¿ure, let vs that are true
ChriÅ¿tians moÅ¿t duetifully thanke our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Father, for beÅ¿towing of him vpon
his whole familie here in earth, and vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one of vs that are his Å¿eruants, wherby
we are knowen in the worlde, and among
our Å¿elues, that wee are his owne. And let
vs alÅ¿o pray vnto our Lorde IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,
the Å¿ender of this holy Å¿pirit, to kindle and
Å¿tirre him vp in our heartes dayly more and
more, that by his aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, we may haue an
earneÅ¿t feeling and lothing of our Å¿innes,
and Å¿o bee brought to doe his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure,
with a carefull keeping of all his
commaundements, vntill we all come to
a full perfection in IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that hope which is layde vp for vs in the

ChriÅ¿t hath purchaÅ¿ed full dearely for vs,
with his owne precious heart blood. To
<pb facs="tcp:10917:115"/>
whom with his Father, and the holy ghoÅ¿t,
three perÅ¿ons in trinitie, and yet one God
in vnitie, be rendred all prayÅ¿e, honour,

out of the euerlaÅ¿ting worde of GOD.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:115"/>
Nowe followeth conÅ¿equently the fourth
part of our ChriÅ¿tian beliefe, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Church, the ninth article with
other three which are annexed vnto the
Church, as the eÅ¿peciall bleÅ¿Å¿ings and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
which flowe and iÅ¿Å¿ue out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
partes, and alwayes doe accompanie
and followe the Å¿pouÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿t. The
cauÅ¿es and matter of our Å¿aluation being
alreadie handled, the effect doeth followe,
which is the Church: OtherwiÅ¿e in vayne
Å¿houlde God create, and ChriÅ¿t redeeme,
and the holy GhoÅ¿t inÅ¿pire and confirme
theÅ¿e benefites and giftes, vnleÅ¿Å¿e there
were Å¿ome that myght bee partakers of
thoÅ¿e treaÅ¿ures, brought out and founded
by the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Trinitie. Againe, Å¿eeing
the kingdome of ChriÅ¿t is euerlaÅ¿ting, it
is very neceÅ¿Å¿arie and requiÅ¿ite, that there
be alwayes Å¿ome which may acknowledge
him for their King and gouernour. To this
ende hath ChriÅ¿t his continuall Church,
and Å¿hall haue to the ende of the worlde, as
he hath had euer from the firÅ¿t beginning.
The meaning therefore of this article, is
this: I beleeue that God almightie hath
alwayes had from the firÅ¿t creation of the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:116"/>
worlde, and hath preÅ¿ently, and Å¿hall haue
vnto the conÅ¿ummation of the worlde, his
Church here in earth, which is, <hi>the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Saints,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, a company and
congregation of faythfull men and women,
which doe truely beleeue in IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,
acknowledging him for their onely Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and Å¿eruing him according to his
worde, receyuing his Sacraments, and
taking holde of all his mercies and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
by fayth onely in his blood: and for
this cauÅ¿e doe wee beleeue that there is but
one true Catholique Church, and no moe
which Å¿hall continue for euer, although
Satan and his miniÅ¿ters goe about by
all meanes poÅ¿Å¿ible to ouerthrowe and Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
it. Wee are then taught here to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that there is <hi>an vniuerÅ¿all Church</hi> of
ChriÅ¿t, and not to beleeue and truÅ¿t in it, as
we doe in God: for that were idolatrie, to
truÅ¿t in men and put our confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce in them.
But wee muÅ¿t truÅ¿t in GOD onely,
and not in this Church, as the PapiÅ¿tes
woulde beare vs in hande: becauÅ¿e the
Church is but the company of the elect and
choÅ¿en, and are men. Nowe wee can not
beleeue and put our hope in any thing
<pb facs="tcp:10917:116"/>
that is a creature, for that were blaÅ¿phemie
to Å¿ay, and wee are alÅ¿o accurÅ¿ed if wee do
Å¿o, as the holy Prophete Ieremie hath by
the mouth of the holy GhoÅ¿t forewarned
vs, Å¿aying, <hi>Thus Å¿ayth the Lorde, CurÅ¿ed
bee the man that truÅ¿teth in man, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
fleÅ¿h his arme, and withdraweth his
heart from the Lorde: for hee Å¿hall be like
the heath in the wildernes, and Å¿hall not
Å¿ee when any good commeth, but Å¿hall
inhabite the parched places in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e,
in a Å¿alte lande and not inhabited,</hi>
Ier. 17. By theÅ¿e woordes then of the holy
ghoÅ¿t, we learne, not to beleeue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church,
but that there is an holy Church of ChriÅ¿te
in this worlde euery where diÅ¿perÅ¿ed and
Å¿cattered abroad through the face of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole
earth. This article doeth declare vnto vs
what the Church is, terming it the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saintes, or fellowÅ¿hippe
of the godly, eyther with ChriÅ¿t, or els with
themÅ¿elues in loue: furthermore what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Church this is, is here likewiÅ¿e Å¿et
downe, that it is holy, by reaÅ¿on of ChriÅ¿t her
head: &amp; catholike, becauÅ¿e it is not tied to any
one place, as Rome, but generally is in all
places of the earth, toÅ¿Å¿ed as a Å¿hip vpon the
Å¿ea fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> one coaÅ¿t to another, as pleaÅ¿eth God
<pb facs="tcp:10917:117"/>
to diÅ¿poÅ¿e of it. To theÅ¿e things, two other
pointes may be adioyned, to make vp the
perfit diÅ¿courÅ¿e of it, and to the which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinges incident to any maner queÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church, may bee eaÅ¿ely referred.
The one is, to conÅ¿ider who is the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿all
head and gouernour of this catholique
Church: the other, by what true markes,
notes, Å¿ignes, and titles, this Church may
be knowen, and diÅ¿cerned from the falÅ¿e and
counter faite Å¿ynagogue of Satan, that is,
from the whoriÅ¿he and Babylonicall Å¿trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
of Rome, which falÅ¿ly taketh vpon her
the name of this chaÅ¿te wife and Å¿pouÅ¿e of
ChriÅ¿te, being an vncleane and a moÅ¿t ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterous
harlot, which hath long agoe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aken
her bridegrome IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, as
it Å¿hall (God willing) hereafter better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
in the diÅ¿courÅ¿e and tract of this
matter. Seeing the Church is likened
to an houÅ¿e, 1. Timothie 3. <hi>and euery
houÅ¿e is builded and gouerned of Å¿ome
man,</hi> Hebr. 3. it is neceÅ¿Å¿arie that this houÅ¿e
alÅ¿o, which is the Church of the liuing God,
haue Å¿ome builder &amp; head of it to looke vnto
it, which is both able to do it, &amp; moÅ¿t ready to
helpe it. <hi>The builder of this Chruch is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us
ChriÅ¿t,</hi> Mat. 16. 18. &amp; he is the only head
<pb facs="tcp:10917:117"/>
of it, as S. Paul doth proue moÅ¿t manifeÅ¿tly
vnto vs, both in the 1. &amp; 4. chap. of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> epiÅ¿tle
of the EpheÅ¿ians, and the 1. chapter to the
ColoÅ¿. Å¿aying, <hi>God hath made all thinges
Å¿ubiect vnder his feet, and hath giuen him
ouer al thinges to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head to the Church,
which is his body, euen the fulneÅ¿Å¿e of him
that filleth all in al things.</hi> And againe, <hi>Let
vs folow the trueth in loue, and in al things
growe vp vnto him, which is the head, that
is ChriÅ¿t, by whom all the body being cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
and knit together by euery ioynt, for
the furniture thereof, according to the
effectuall power which is in the meaÅ¿ure
of euery part, receyueth increaÅ¿e of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> edifiyng of it Å¿elfe in loue,</hi> Ephe.
4. So in the ColoÅ¿. 1. 18. <hi>He is the head of
the body of the Church.</hi> Out of this doeth
the body of ChriÅ¿t which is his Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
a Å¿pecial and Å¿inguler comfort againÅ¿t
al te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tations, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they Å¿halbe defended &amp; preÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for euer: for ChriÅ¿t ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> not forÅ¿ake his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> not but loue it, &amp; nouriÅ¿h it, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoÅ¿e
Å¿piritual graces which come &amp; proceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head &amp; fountaine. For as we Å¿ee in the
body naturall, how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the head receiueth not
meate for it Å¿elfe, but for the cheriÅ¿hing and
increaÅ¿ing of the Å¿trength of the body, and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:118"/>
the reÅ¿t of the members: Å¿o the Lorde IeÅ¿us
is not an head for himÅ¿elf, but for vs, neyther
hath hee receyued all power and authoritie
of his father, with the fulneÅ¿Å¿e of the holy
GhoÅ¿t, to keepe it to him Å¿elfe, but to giue
and to impart it moÅ¿t louingly and liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his true members, to make them to
grow vp more and more, till they come to a
perfection in him. If ChriÅ¿t therefore haue
Å¿trength, holineÅ¿Å¿e, power, and all other
good giftes and graces of the Å¿pirite, then
may the Church aÅ¿Å¿ure her Å¿elfe of them all,
becauÅ¿e the wife may recken that all
the goodes and landes of her huÅ¿bande are
hers: and wee knowe that the Church hath
this dignitie and prerogatiue, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿timable
and full of wonderfull loue, that
Å¿hee is counted and called, as Å¿hee is in very
deede, the chaÅ¿te wife and Å¿pouÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿te
here vpon the earth, to whome hee is ioyned
with the coniunction and fellowÅ¿hippe of
his heauenly Å¿pirite. <hi>I haue</hi> (Å¿ayth Paul)
<hi>prepared you for one huÅ¿band, to preÅ¿ent
you as a pure virgin vnto ChriÅ¿t,</hi> 2. Corin.
11. Cantic. 4. Ezechiel 16. EpheÅ¿ians 5.
What noble man will bee content to take
a poore wretched beggerwoman out of
the Å¿treetes, full of ragges and filthineÅ¿Å¿e,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:118"/>
to make her his wife? And yet the Lorde
IeÅ¿us hath done greater thinges in mercie
for vs, then this: <hi>for when hee paÅ¿Å¿ed by,
hee looked vpon vs, and beholde, our
tyme was as the time of loue, hee Å¿predde
his Å¿kirtes ouer vs and couered our filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e,
yea, hee Å¿ware vnto vs, and entred
into couenant with vs, and we became
his owne.</hi> So is the Lorde in mariage
become nowe our head, and wee his Å¿pouÅ¿e:
let vs then take heede that wee admitte no
others into his loue, or defile our Å¿elues
with whoredome and idolatrie, in giuing
our faith and allegeance to Å¿traungers and
falÅ¿e goddes, whome wee knowe not. Our
huÅ¿bande is very ielous ouer vs: hee can
not abide another man to bee admitted vnto
his bedde, for that were Å¿pirituall fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and adulterie before him, which hee
wyll puniÅ¿he moÅ¿t Å¿euerely, as hee did in
the IÅ¿raelites which brake couenant with
him, and betooke them Å¿elues to Idoles,
and bowed downe to them in Å¿teade of him,
as the Prophete declareth, Ezechiel 16.
Seeyng then ChriÅ¿t is appoynted the head
of his Church, and that one wife (as there
is but one bodie, which is the Church)
can haue but one huÅ¿bande to bee her head,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:119"/>
and one houÅ¿e, but one Lorde and maÅ¿ter to
rule it: what wickedneÅ¿Å¿e is it to Å¿ay that
the Pope of Rome is an vniuerÅ¿all head
ouer the Church? Is not this to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
ChriÅ¿tes roome and dignitie, or rather
is it not to make the Church a monÅ¿ter to
haue two heades in one body? But they Å¿ay
that the ByÅ¿hope of Rome is the viÅ¿ible
heade in ChriÅ¿tes Å¿teade: but this they can
not Å¿hewe by Scripture, neither doeth the
Church require any Å¿uch heade: for ChriÅ¿t
is preÅ¿ent with it, as he hath promiÅ¿ed, <hi>Mat.
28. I am with you alwayes, euen vnto
the ende of the worlde.</hi> If the Pope be a
viÅ¿ible heade, why is he not Å¿eene of al men?
why doeth he not gouerne all men in the
Church, and giue nouriÅ¿hment vnto them,
as the heade ought to doe? This he doth
not: wherefore he is no viÅ¿ible heade, as he
doth pretende. And Å¿urely to be the general
head ouer al, is too great a matter &amp; enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priÅ¿e
for any mortal man to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> him. I
am Å¿ure the Pope will graunt him Å¿elfe to
be a member of this <hi>Catholike Church:</hi> If
hee then bee a member, howe can hee be an
head, except the Å¿ame thing Å¿halbe both an
heade and member, which is very abÅ¿urde &amp;
monÅ¿truous? If he Å¿ay, that as he is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:119"/>
ChriÅ¿t is his head only, and not another:
why Å¿hall not ChriÅ¿t bee as well a head for
all? TheÅ¿e thinges (wee Å¿ee) are very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diÅ¿h
and fonde. But yet they apply and Å¿ay,
that ChriÅ¿t Å¿ayde to Peter, <hi>Thou art Peter,
and vpon this rocke will I builde my
Church.</hi> FirÅ¿t note, hee Å¿ayth not vpon
thee Peter will I builde, but vpon this
rocke, meaning, the fayth of Peters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion,
which confeÅ¿Å¿ed him to be ChriÅ¿t:
therefore by the rocke hee meant himÅ¿elfe.
For when Peter had Å¿ayd, <hi>Thou art ChriÅ¿t
the Å¿onne of God,</hi> ChriÅ¿t Å¿ayd to him, <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this rocke will I builde my Church:</hi> and
in that place hee giueth no more to Peter
in the keys, which is the binding and loÅ¿ing
of Å¿inners, then he giueth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> al els where,
as in Ioh. 20. when he Å¿aid, <hi>Receiue the holy
GhoÅ¿t: whoÅ¿oeuers Å¿innes ye remit, they are
remitted, &amp; whoÅ¿oeuers Å¿innes ye reteyne,
they are reteyned.</hi> Here all haue as much
as Peter: and if they will beleeue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which they brag of much, they do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
referre this vnto Peter alone, but to the
reÅ¿t of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoÅ¿tles &amp; to al faithful miniÅ¿ters of
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. As Orige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in his 1. homi. vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
Mat. &amp; Å¿o doth Cyprian, AmbroÅ¿e, Ierome,
&amp; AuguÅ¿tine. And what hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pope to do w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10917:120"/>
theÅ¿e woordes, which followeth not Peter,
neyther in life nor doctrine? A Å¿trange thing
it is to Å¿ee, how they builde their kingdome
vpon Peter, and whatÅ¿oeuer is Å¿aide of him,
they take it to them Å¿elues. But before they
can prooue any thing in deede, they muÅ¿t
prooue theÅ¿e three poyntes vnto vs, if they
wil haue the Pope to be the Å¿upreme head of
the whole Church, which they Å¿hall be neuer
able to doe by the Å¿criptures, as long as they
liue. FirÅ¿t, they muÅ¿t prooue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter was
chiefe and head of all the ApoÅ¿tles. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he was at Rome, and Å¿ate there as
BiÅ¿hop generall. Thirdly, that hee left all
the title and preeminence of this Å¿eate to his
Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ours whatÅ¿oeuer. If they prooue the
two firÅ¿t poyntes, (as they can not) yet
they make nothing againÅ¿t vs, although we
Å¿houlde graunt it them, vnles they proue the
third, (which they Å¿hall neuer be able to do)
that Peter hath left all his authoritie to his
Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ours after him for euer. ForaÅ¿much
then as the Pope neither is nor ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> be any ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall
head to this Church, but ChriÅ¿te
IeÅ¿us alone, which is alwayes preÅ¿e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it, &amp;
euer walketh in the midÅ¿t of the Å¿eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> golden
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dleÅ¿ticks, Å¿o y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he needeth no vicar general,
or vniuerÅ¿al B. let vs, dearly beloued, as we
<pb facs="tcp:10917:120"/>
loue the Lorde IeÅ¿us our head, and tender
the Å¿aluation of our owne Å¿oules, flee farre
from the Pope and all his adherents, tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
decrees and pardons, leÅ¿t hee make
marchandiÅ¿e alÅ¿o of our Å¿oules, as he doth
of a great many, both in Rome &amp; Spaine,
and els where. This being Å¿et downe as a
moÅ¿t certaine and Å¿ure principle, that <hi>ChriÅ¿t
is the head of this church,</hi> it would be Å¿eene
what authoritie this church hath, and what
rule or power is graunted vnto it. If the
PapiÅ¿tes will graunt, (as they can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but) that this church is the wife, &amp; chaÅ¿te
and obedient Å¿pouÅ¿e to her Lorde and huÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t: If (I Å¿ay) they will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
this, this controuerÅ¿ie betweene them
and vs, of the authoritie of the Churche,
whether it be greater then the Å¿criptures,
and worde of ChriÅ¿t, Å¿hall not bee hard to
diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿e, but Å¿oone ended. For what authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
&amp; iuriÅ¿diction a wiÅ¿e man wil graunt to
his wife vnder him, that libertie is to bee
graunted to the church vnder ChriÅ¿t. If it
be reaÅ¿on and iuÅ¿t, that a wife Å¿houlde not
controll, or be Å¿uperior, and aboue her huÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes
worde and commaundement, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a wiÅ¿e and diÅ¿crete huÅ¿bande, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
and commaunde her: then is it no
<pb facs="tcp:10917:121"/>
reaÅ¿on or right (whatÅ¿oeuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papiÅ¿ts Å¿ay) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
the authoritie of the church, which is the
wife, Å¿hould be greater and of more force,
then the woorde and will of the huÅ¿bande
ChriÅ¿t, Å¿eeing that <hi>S. Paul Å¿aith, Eph. 5. 24.
that the church is in Å¿ubiection to ChriÅ¿t,</hi>
and from thence draweth an argument of
the obedience and Å¿ubiection of wiues to
their huÅ¿bands, which Å¿urely can not be Å¿o
in euery thing, as Paul there willeth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Church bee in Å¿ubiection, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the authoritie of the will and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of the huÅ¿bande in all things. If
they will not permit, but thinke it vnreaÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
vnles they goe againÅ¿t Å¿cripture,
that the wiues authoritie Å¿hould bee either
equall or Å¿uperiour to the huÅ¿band, why
then doe they Å¿uffer and teache, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and conÅ¿titutions of the churche, to
make articles, lawes, Å¿acrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts, and other
rites and ceremonies, are aboue the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the written worde? and Å¿o conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
aboue ChriÅ¿t him Å¿elfe, which can
not be Å¿eparated from his worde and will,
which hee will haue vs to receiue as him
Å¿elfe? For Å¿peaking of his ApoÅ¿tles and
other miniÅ¿ters, that brought his worde to
the people, he Å¿aith, <hi>He that receiueth you,
receiueth me, and hee that deÅ¿piÅ¿eth you,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:121"/>
deÅ¿piÅ¿eth me.</hi> And therefore, when the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿aries
Å¿aye, that the authoritie of the
Church is greater then the woorde and
Å¿criptures of God, what doe they Å¿aye els,
but that man is aboue God, &amp; the wife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the huÅ¿band? The one is blaÅ¿phemy,
and the other abÅ¿urde. Wee Å¿ee then by
theÅ¿e thinges, that the authoritie of the
church, is to obey ChriÅ¿t in all things, and
to doe Å¿uch workes and buÅ¿ines as he hath
commanded in his worde, except it bee in
indifferent matters, not repugning vnto
the worde, nor hindering godlines, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
voyde of Å¿uperÅ¿tition, and without
clogge of conÅ¿cience. The <hi>Church</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
and likened to <hi>an houÅ¿e, 1. Timoth.</hi> 3
or to a <hi>family:</hi> and Å¿hall the houÅ¿hold and
family be aboue the authoritie and will of
the maÅ¿ter? Å¿hall the Å¿eruantes and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
haue greater authoritie in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
then the Lorde and father of the
houÅ¿e? Howe doe theÅ¿e thinges agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?
And howe hath Satan (the God
of this worlde) blynded the eyes of the
Pope and his Å¿hauelings, that the light of
the glorious GoÅ¿pel of ChriÅ¿t Å¿houlde not
Å¿hine vnto them? But let vs heare their
proofes and arguments for this authoritie.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:122"/>
The church (Å¿ay they) hath allowed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
the Å¿criptures, &amp; diÅ¿cerned the falÅ¿e
from the true, admitting the GoÅ¿pell of
Matthewe, Marke, Luke, and Iohn, and
reiecting the GoÅ¿pell of Nicodenius, and
Thomas with others: therefore it is aboue
the Å¿criptures. A goodly argument and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on.
As if they Å¿hould argue thus: I doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
and approue the authoritie of the
prince, therefore I am greater and aboue
her authoritie. If they would make this
reaÅ¿on with her, as they make the like with
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, they might (peraduenture)
come Å¿hort home, and be found traitours to
her, (as in the Å¿upremacie of the Pope they
all are, if they holde their owne doctrine &amp;
mainteine it,) as they are to IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,
their chiefe prince. Againe, one man telleth
another which is the king, and diÅ¿cerneth
him from one that is not the king: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he that doeth thus tel and diÅ¿cerne the
king from another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, is greater then the
king in authoritie. This is their reaÅ¿on, &amp;
all one. The church (forÅ¿ooth) becauÅ¿e it
hath diÅ¿cerned the true writings of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
GhoÅ¿t, from thoÅ¿e that were cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>terfaite
and falÅ¿e, therefore they will haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church
to be aboue this worde: which is vtterly
<pb facs="tcp:10917:122"/>
falÅ¿e, and in no point foloweth. They might
by this reaÅ¿on proue them Å¿elues, or others
to be aboue God him Å¿elfe, becauÅ¿e many
can diÅ¿cerne and tyre the true and liuing
God from the forged and falÅ¿e gods, and
they can tyre and Å¿eparate the true Å¿pirite
from the lying Å¿pirite: therefore they are
greater in authoritie, then this Å¿pirite of
God is. Who Å¿eeth not theÅ¿e things to bee
Å¿o childiÅ¿h, that they neede no refutation at
all, becauÅ¿e if they be once examined by the
touchÅ¿tone, they fall of them Å¿elues, and do
eaÅ¿ely deÅ¿crie what they are? Well, let vs
holde this for a grounde moÅ¿t certaine and
Å¿ure, which can not bee Å¿haken: that <hi>the
worde which ChriÅ¿t hath Å¿poken in his
fathers name, the Å¿ame Å¿hall iudge in the
laÅ¿t day,</hi> as hee him Å¿elfe Å¿ayth, <hi>Iohn. 12.
verÅ¿e</hi> 48. Then if the worde be iudge, it is
(belike) greater, and aboue them that muÅ¿t
be iudged by it (which is the church) in the
latter daye, euen as the iudge here is of
greater authoritie, then the partie whome
he iudgeth. And here by the way falleth to
the ground, another falÅ¿e poÅ¿itio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of theirs,
that Å¿ay the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of the Å¿criptures
muÅ¿t be according to the church: nay it muÅ¿t
be according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, which is the iudge:
<pb facs="tcp:10917:123"/>
for if this be a matter of controuerÅ¿ie, who
Å¿hall determine and decide it, but the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
iudge? as we Å¿ee the lawes muÅ¿t bee
interpreted, not according to the cenÅ¿ure
and iudgement of them to whome they
were giuen, but after the will and meaning
of the iudge and lawe giuer, which made
them: Å¿o the Å¿criptures muÅ¿t bee interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Å¿criptures, and the worde, by the
worde, and that which is Å¿poken obÅ¿curely
in one place, by that which is declared and
vttered more plainely in an other place.
As for example: The papiÅ¿tes, to proue that
Å¿innes may be forgiuen hereafter in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worlde, in their fayned purgatorie,
bring this place out of the 12. chapter of
Matthewe, where our Å¿auiour Å¿aith, that
<hi>he that Å¿peaketh a worde againÅ¿t the holy
GhoÅ¿t, Å¿hall not bee forgiuen, neither in
this worlde nor in the worlde to come:</hi>
Ergo Å¿ay they, to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h their purgatorie,
Å¿ome Å¿innes may be forgiuen after this life,
and where is that, but in purgatorie: but
if they had read the thirde of Marke (hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Å¿ame matter) and conferred one
place with an other, they Å¿hould haue Å¿eene
there, that our Å¿auiours meaning was to
Å¿hewe, that the horriblenes of this Å¿inne
<pb facs="tcp:10917:123"/>
was Å¿o great, that it Å¿hould neuer be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
for theÅ¿e are his verie wordes there.
<hi>Verely I Å¿ay vnto you, al Å¿innes Å¿halbe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, &amp; blaÅ¿phemies,
wherewith they blaÅ¿pheme: but he that
blaÅ¿phemeth againÅ¿t the holy GhoÅ¿t, Å¿hall
neuer haue forgiuenes, but is culpable of
eternall damnation, Mark.</hi> 3. So likewiÅ¿e
is that place in <hi>Matthewe</hi> of the keyes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
in <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. by remitting or retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Å¿innes by all the ApoÅ¿tles, and not
by Peter only. Nowe out of this note that
ChriÅ¿t is the head and only great Å¿hepheard
of his church, commeth forth many good &amp;
fruitfull branches for this whole church,
that is, many good leÅ¿Å¿ons for vs in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
&amp; maners: For if ChriÅ¿t be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of
this congregation, then it Å¿halbe perpetual
and for euer, becauÅ¿e y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of it is for euer,
therefore the body muÅ¿t be Å¿o alÅ¿o. As the
Lord promiÅ¿eth in <hi>Ieremie cha.</hi> 31. Å¿aying,
<hi>This Å¿aieth the Lorde, which giueth the
Å¿unne for a light to the day, and the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es
of the moone and of the Å¿tarres a light
to the night, which breaketh the Å¿ea when
the waues thereof roare, his name is the
Lord of hoÅ¿tes. If theÅ¿e ordinances depart
out of my Å¿ight,</hi> (Å¿ayeth the Lorde) <hi>then
<pb facs="tcp:10917:124"/>
Å¿hall the Å¿eede of IÅ¿rael ceaÅ¿e from being a
nation before me for euer. Thus Å¿ayth the
Lorde, If the heauens can be meaÅ¿ured, or
the foundations of the earth be Å¿earched
out beneath: then will I caÅ¿t off all the
Å¿eede of IÅ¿rael, for all that they haue done,
Å¿ayth the Lorde.</hi> By the which wordes the
Lorde meaneth that his church Å¿hall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
for euer, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿unne, moone &amp; Å¿tarres
doe: which Å¿urely is very comfortable to
all his, to conÅ¿ider that they Å¿hall be for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
as their head is, and haue immortalitie
with him. Againe, if ChriÅ¿t be from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
then he hath had this church alÅ¿o
from the beginning: firÅ¿t in Adam, then in
Abel, and Seth, and Å¿o foorth in Noe. And
this he hath, and will preÅ¿erue: for they are
his members, whome he loueth, and feedeth
as a father doth his deare and owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>PÅ¿alm.</hi> 103. And if ChriÅ¿t be the head
of it, it muÅ¿t needes be holy alÅ¿o, as here we
doe beleeue. For howe Å¿hould the body be
vnholy, when the head is Å¿o holy? although
this holines be not ful and perfite here, (for
the church is in a continuail warrefare and
fight againÅ¿t Å¿inne and wickedneÅ¿Å¿e,) yet it
Å¿hall be perfited hereafter, when it Å¿halbe
fully ioyned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her head in heauen. In the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:124"/>
meane Å¿eaÅ¿on it is called holy, becauÅ¿e it
contendeth for holineÅ¿Å¿e, and becauÅ¿e the
holineÅ¿Å¿e of ChriÅ¿t is imputed vnto it: but
this is not in it Å¿elfe: for the church is
taught to pray daily, <hi>Forgiue vs our treÅ¿pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es:
and there is no man without Å¿inne
that liueth here in earth, 1. Ioh.</hi> 1. yea this
church may, and hath erred, as euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
particularly may erre, as <hi>Peter did in
the vocation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentiles, Act.</hi> 10. and in
diÅ¿Å¿imulation, in eating with the Gentiles,
&amp; withdrawing himÅ¿elf from them againe,
when Iames came to him, and was iuÅ¿tly
therefore reprehended of <hi>Saint Paul, Gal.</hi>
2. Then if <hi>Peter erred,</hi> Å¿o notable &amp; Å¿ingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
an ApoÅ¿tle, others may erre alÅ¿o, but yet
returne with Peter: yea the whole church
at Å¿ome time haue erred, as al the ApoÅ¿tles
doubted of ChriÅ¿tes reÅ¿urrection, and yet
they were the Church of ChriÅ¿t, and the
beÅ¿t men and moÅ¿t perfite that were then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue,
<hi>Mark. 16. verÅ¿e</hi> 14. This I Å¿ay to that
ende, that none Å¿hould imagine Å¿uch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in the church, as the AnabaptiÅ¿ts
doe and others, which can not be attayned
vnto in this life: And therefore becauÅ¿e
they Å¿ee Å¿ome abuÅ¿es, Å¿ome diÅ¿Å¿olute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons,
and Å¿ome errors in the Church (which
<pb facs="tcp:10917:125"/>
is like a field that hath corne and tares in
it) they by and by depart from it, and break
and diuide the vnitie of the Church, by
their ignorance and frowardneÅ¿Å¿e, not
knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the kingdome of heauen (which
is the Church) is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pared of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf
to a net caÅ¿t into the Sea, that taketh both
good and bad fyÅ¿hes together in it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.
I Å¿peake not this, to mayntayne any thing
that is amiÅ¿Å¿e, if it may be reformed by
order. For I wiÅ¿h all thinges to be wel,
which are out of order in our church, and I
hope God will in his time cut off all diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders:
but I Å¿peake it to this ende, that
none Å¿hould Å¿eparate himÅ¿elf from hearing
the woorde and receauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacraments,
and from publicke prayers in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
If al things in the miniÅ¿tery be not
Å¿o perfect as euery goodman would deÅ¿ire,
and as the word of God requireth it Å¿hould
bee, we muÅ¿t in deede contend and indeuour
for a perfection, as much as lyeth in vs,
which I pray God may be earneÅ¿tly Å¿ought
for of euery one in his vocation. But they
that are priuate men, muÅ¿t helpe with their
prayers, their teares and groninges, and
muÅ¿t Å¿eeke to further this woorke by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
interceÅ¿Å¿ion to the Lorde, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:10917:125"/>
to leaue off, neyther to giue him any
reÅ¿t, vntill he repayre, and vntill hee Å¿et vp
IeruÅ¿alem the prayÅ¿e of the worlde. And
Å¿o for Sions Å¿ake, they muÅ¿t not holde
their tongue, vntil the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
breake foorth as a light, and the Å¿alua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof vs a burning lampe. Which
God put into the heartes and mindes of
them that haue authoritie in the buylding
and repairing of this Å¿piritual Church vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord. For ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the temple at HieruÅ¿alem, and there
taught the people his fathers wil, although
the hie PrieÅ¿ts, the Scribes, and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es
had made it a de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ne of theeues, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
corrupted all things in it, both by
their doctrine, and alÅ¿o by their manners:
neither did <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿eparate himÅ¿elfe from
the church of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> although
many abuÅ¿es had crept in among them, in
Å¿o much, that Å¿ome denied the reÅ¿urrection,
the chiefeÅ¿t poynt one of them in ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie,
yet notwithÅ¿tanding all this, hee
called it a Church, and the Corinthians
Å¿anctifyed in IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. And Å¿o wee Å¿ee
he did not withdrawe himÅ¿elfe from them,
but vouchÅ¿afed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the name of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:126"/>
and goeth about (as wee Å¿hould all doe,) to
bring them to the purity of the GoÅ¿pel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
Thus much for this poynt: let vs
returne to our purpoÅ¿e. ChriÅ¿t being the
head of this church, it Å¿hall not be hard for
vs to diÅ¿cerne who are the members of it,
and who appertayne vnto the Å¿ame. This
<hi>church</hi> is Å¿aid to be <hi>holy,</hi> and the <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Å¿ayntes:</hi> then all they that are holy,
&amp; Å¿a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ctified by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿pirit of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, are of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ber of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>gregation: for if they wil
be of his body, they muÅ¿t haue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> him holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e,
which hath Å¿aid. <hi>Be ye holy, for I am
holy:</hi> &amp; they ought to reÅ¿e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ble him in their
life &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>uerÅ¿atio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, in godlines, in integrity,
in innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cie &amp; al other chriÅ¿tia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vertues. We
Å¿ee then howe we onght to endeuour to be
like him, &amp; theÅ¿e are the words of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi>
where that he Å¿ayth, <hi>He that remayneth in
him, ought euen Å¿o to walke, as hee hath
walked:</hi> That is, he muÅ¿t be incorporated &amp;
ingrafted to the body of ChriÅ¿t, otherwiÅ¿e
there is no Å¿aluation for him. <hi>He is the true
vine, and we are the branches: if we abide
in him, we bring forth much fruite,</hi> &amp; wee
Å¿halbe purged to bring forth more fruite:
but as the branche, except it abide in the
vine, dieth &amp; withereth away without any
<pb facs="tcp:10917:126"/>
fruit, and is caÅ¿t into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fire: Å¿o is euery one,
that is not of the body of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. Let
vs therefore indeuour to be of this body, for
without the Church is no Å¿aluation, as all
periÅ¿hed by the waters, which were not in
the arke of Noe, which was a true Å¿igne
and figure of the church, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. And as the
hand cut off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the body, dieth, and lacketh
life: Å¿o it is in the myÅ¿ticall body of the
Church, no lyfe without the body of ChriÅ¿t:
and that is the thing that is meant in theÅ¿e
places of holy Å¿cripture. In the thirteenth
chapter of Ezechiel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord threatneth the
falÅ¿e prophets, that his hand Å¿halbe vpon
them that Å¿ee vanity, &amp; deuine lyes, Å¿aying,
<hi>They Å¿hall not be in the aÅ¿Å¿embly of my
people, neither Å¿hal they be written in the
writing of the houÅ¿e of IÅ¿rael, neither Å¿hal
they enter into the land of IÅ¿rael.</hi> Wherby
he excludeth them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> his church. So it is
Å¿aid in Ioel the Å¿econd, <hi>In mount Sion and
IeruÅ¿alem Å¿halbe deliuerance, as the Lord
hath Å¿ayde.</hi> The like is in Abdie: but moÅ¿t
notable is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place in the Å¿econd of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Acts,
where it is Å¿ayd, that <hi>the Lorde added to
the church from day to day, Å¿uch as
Å¿houlde be Å¿aued:</hi> giuing vs thus much to
vnderÅ¿ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnles they be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, there

is no Å¿aluation for them. By this then we
gather, that if they only be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>bers of this
church, which beleeue in ChriÅ¿t, and are
holy, then the Turkes &amp; Iewes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
not in ChriÅ¿t, but perÅ¿ecute him moÅ¿t
deadly, are not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, becauÅ¿e they are
not vnited &amp; ioyned to this body. LikewiÅ¿e
all the Heretikes, which haue broken the
vnity &amp; peace of this Church, Å¿ome by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the humanitie of ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿ome
his diuinitie, are not to be counted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of ChriÅ¿t, neither they that haue depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the felowÅ¿hip of the godly and
Å¿ayntes of God to AntichriÅ¿t, can haue any
part in this congregation, or be heyres of
life, vnles they returne againe with Å¿peede
to the Church. Here likewiÅ¿e are all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiÅ¿ts</hi>
and vngodly liuers Å¿hut out from
this church. For they communicate not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
the Å¿aintes, either in life or doctrine, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe they relieue the poore and afflicted
members of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleÅ¿Å¿ings
which God hath beÅ¿towed vpon them:
Å¿o that there is no communion of brotherly
loue among them, whereby they Å¿hould be
knowen to be of this holy body. Now y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we
know that ChriÅ¿t is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of this church,
(as is proued) let vs come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿eco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d point,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:127"/>
to Å¿ee by what markes and tokens this true
church may be diÅ¿cerned from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falÅ¿e &amp; hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocricall
Å¿inagogue of Satan. For this
Å¿tandeth vs greatly in hand to know, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e
we may be deceiued in taking the one
for the other. Two Å¿ignes there are wherby
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of ChriÅ¿t is knowen: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one is the
<hi>preaching of the word of God,</hi> contained
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old &amp; new TeÅ¿tame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, &amp; is deuided into
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law &amp; GoÅ¿pel: Å¿o that where this word is
Å¿ou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ded out by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preachers, purely &amp; Å¿ound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out mixture &amp; corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s,
&amp; receaued reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tly, there is no doubt
the church of ChriÅ¿t, as ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf doth
witnes, <hi>My Å¿heepe here my voice &amp; follow
me.</hi> This is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firÅ¿t &amp; principal note of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
church, to heare ChriÅ¿ts word, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. and
where this word wanteth, there can be no
church. <hi>For ChriÅ¿t doth Å¿a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ctifie &amp; clenÅ¿e it
by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waÅ¿hing of water through the word,
Eph.</hi> 5. This made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophets in olde time
to be careful y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> they brought nothing but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
word of God to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, Å¿aying. <hi>Heare the
worde of the Lord. The mouth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord
hath Å¿poken:</hi> and alwaies they brought the
people when they were gone aÅ¿tray, to this
worde &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mandement of the Lord. This
made <hi>S. Paul</hi> to Å¿ay, y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> 
                     <hi>he had deliuered no
other thing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:128"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that he had receyued of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, 1. Cor.</hi>
11. Neither did ChriÅ¿t, when he Å¿ent his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles
abroad to preach, giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> liberty to
preach what they liÅ¿t: <hi>But go and preach,</hi>
(Å¿ayth hee,) <hi>teaching them to obÅ¿erue all
things, whatÅ¿oeuer I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>manded you:</hi>
reÅ¿training the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> alwaies to his word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> church is gathered together, not the
word vnwritten, which they call vnwritten
verities, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> traditions of the ApoÅ¿tles, and
y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> church, but the word written only. For of
the other wee haue no certainty, yea their
vnwritten verities are againÅ¿t the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
veritie and worde of ChriÅ¿t, which is a
thing very abÅ¿urde. For the worde written
doeth allowe all meates to be eaten with
thankeÅ¿giuing without choyÅ¿e, any apparel
to be worne without differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce: neither doth
it condemne matrimonie in any degree or
eÅ¿tate of perÅ¿ons, as they do in the miniÅ¿ters
of the woorde. Now their vnwritten veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
doe forbid al theÅ¿e things, and a great
many moe, which are contrary to the word
reueiled. Wel, let vs holde this poynt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
<hi>that the worde truely preached, is
the firÅ¿t note to know this church by:</hi> the
other note is the true vÅ¿e &amp; adminiÅ¿tration
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿acrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts, inÅ¿tituted by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:128"/>
which are two in number: the one is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me,
wherein we are admitted into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowÅ¿hippe
of this Church of ChriÅ¿t, and by
the which we are aÅ¿Å¿ured of the remiÅ¿Å¿ion of
our Å¿innes by ChriÅ¿tes blood, as wee are
Å¿ure, that the water doeth outwardly waÅ¿h
the body and Å¿pottes of the fleÅ¿h. This Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
doth Paul call <hi>the waÅ¿hing of the
new byrth, Titus</hi> 5. and Å¿ayth, that all they
that are baptized vnto ChriÅ¿t, haue put on
ChriÅ¿t. Furthermore the Lord IeÅ¿us doeth
not thinke it Å¿ufficient, or ynough to admit
vs onely into his houÅ¿e and familie, by this
Å¿igne of BaptiÅ¿me, but doeth alÅ¿o being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
feede vs continually with heauenly
and Å¿pirituall foode vnto euerlaÅ¿ting life,
which is done with the other Sacrament of
his precious body &amp; blood, called the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
or the Lordes Supper. So that as
the Å¿hephearde doeth not onely gather his
Å¿heepe into his folde or Å¿heepecote, but doth
alÅ¿o prouide meat for them, and paÅ¿ture: and
as the maÅ¿ter doeth not onely enterteine his
Å¿eruant into his Å¿eruice, by giuing him his
liuery coate and badge, whereby he is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowen to be his man, but doeth prouide
and giue him meate &amp; drinke dayly to feede
him: Å¿o Å¿urely doth the Lord with vs in theÅ¿e
<pb facs="tcp:10917:129"/>
Sacramentes. For by BaptiÅ¿me doeth he
admit vs to his Å¿eruice, and by the Supper
doeth he feede vs, that wee periÅ¿h not with
hunger. So that where wee Å¿ee theÅ¿e Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes
duely adminiÅ¿tred, without any
inuentions of mans witte or brayne, the one
with the word and water, the other with the
worde, and bread and wine, without other
Å¿uperÅ¿tions and additions, there we may
acknowledge the Church of ChriÅ¿t to bee
preÅ¿ent, and he in the middeÅ¿t of them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his worde, as hee hath promiÅ¿ed,
<hi>Where two or three are gathered together
in my name, there am I in the middes of
them, Matth.</hi> 18. Now theÅ¿e Sacraments
are in Å¿ome thinges vnlike. Concerning
the firÅ¿t, which is BaptiÅ¿me, it is to bee
vÅ¿ed but once of a ChriÅ¿tian man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and not often: as the Iewes vÅ¿ed but
once to circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ciÅ¿e their children, which Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciÅ¿ion
was a Å¿igne of our BaptiÅ¿me,
which we haue in Å¿teade of it: Å¿o this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me
of infantes is not to bee iterated.
For euen as a man is borne but once, Å¿o
once baptizing is Å¿ufficient, to Å¿ignifie
our newe byrth in ChriÅ¿t. Therefore they
were ouerÅ¿eene, which woulde haue it to
bee iterated and done agayne, as Saint
<pb facs="tcp:10917:129"/>
Cyprian was in that errour. The other
Sacrament muÅ¿t bee often vÅ¿ed of euery
ChriÅ¿tian man and woman, as the Iewes
vÅ¿ed many times and often, euery yeere to
eate the PaÅ¿chall Lambe or PaÅ¿Å¿eouer: Å¿o
muÅ¿t wee alÅ¿o often reÅ¿ort to the Lordes
Table, but Å¿till with reuerence, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and faith to eate and feede Å¿piritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
vpon IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t his body and blood.
For this Sacrament came in the place of
the PaÅ¿Å¿eouer: Å¿o that as they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
their comming and deliuerie from the
bondage and thraldome of Egypt and
Pharao by this Lambe: In like Å¿ort muÅ¿t
wee remember by this Sacrament our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
by ChriÅ¿t from the deuill and
hell, from the Å¿lauery of Å¿inne, whereof
the Iewes deliueraunce both in Egypt and
Babylon, were moÅ¿t liuely Å¿ignes and
figures vnto our eyes, to beholde that
which ChriÅ¿t hath done for vs in <hi>dying
for our Å¿innes vpon the croÅ¿Å¿e, that wee
might bee made righteous in him, 1.
Corinth.</hi> 1. Nowe the oftener wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ber
this which is done, eÅ¿pecially in the
Communion, the better it is for vs, alwaies
remembring this, that wee come thither
<pb facs="tcp:10917:130"/>
with examination of our Å¿elues, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle
willeth, leaÅ¿t we come to iudgement
and condemnation. This then is not to be
done at EaÅ¿ter onely, as the blinde cuÅ¿tome
of the PapiÅ¿ts was, but at other times alÅ¿o,
except they wil make it Å¿ufficient for a man
to eate once in a yeere, to feede his bodie:
wherefore as we often vÅ¿e to eate corporall
and earthly foode to feede the body, which
otherwiÅ¿e would Å¿tarue: Å¿o muÅ¿t we freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t
this Supper, which is holy, many times &amp;
often to feede our Å¿oule, which is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary
then the feeding of the body: and the
meate of the one muÅ¿t bee had, and a great
deale Å¿ooner then the prouiÅ¿ion of the other,
I meane, of the body, which is but mortall.
TheÅ¿e are the outward Å¿ignes, whereby the
Church of ChriÅ¿t may bee knowen from
the temple of idoles. I am not ignorant that
there are other Å¿ignes, as the holy GhoÅ¿t,
and faith, which becauÅ¿e they are inwarde,
and knowen to God, and euery mans owne
conÅ¿cience, I let them paÅ¿Å¿e, I onely Å¿peake
here of the viÅ¿ible Å¿ignes and markes of the
church, whereby it is manifeÅ¿ted vnto men,
Å¿uch as the worde and Sacramentes be. If
then theÅ¿e be the Å¿ignes of true ChriÅ¿tians,
let vs that are EngliÅ¿h men, vÅ¿e them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:130"/>
let vs in Å¿eaÅ¿on and out of Å¿eaÅ¿on
heare the worde, &amp; with reuerence embrace
it, &amp; let vs withal confirme it in our hearts,
as with a Å¿eale, by the reuerent receiuing of
the Å¿acraments of our Lorde IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.
This ground being layde, that the Church
is knowen by the worde of ChriÅ¿t, and his
Sacramentes beyng vÅ¿ed as hee ordayned
them, we can not acknowledge the Church
of Rome to be this Catholike Church of
ChriÅ¿t: for Å¿hee hath not theÅ¿e markes in her
forehead. For it is moÅ¿t manifeÅ¿t, that Å¿hee
hath burned this worde of ChriÅ¿t in the fire,
and refuÅ¿ed it, and in Å¿teade of it Å¿ette vp the
worde of man, the decrees of Popes, and
conÅ¿titutions of their owne, as the liues of
Saintes in their Legende, which is full of
abominable lies: they mainteyne their own
traditions aboue this worde, and haue them
in greater eÅ¿timation: Å¿o that the neglect
of their owne trumpery, as to eate fleÅ¿h in
Lent, or to breake their faÅ¿ting dayes, is
more Å¿euerely puniÅ¿hed by them, and made
a greater matter then the open contempt of
Gods Lawes: For the adulterie of their
PrieÅ¿tes, Friers, and their Nunnes, was
counted but a light matter, &amp; no Å¿inne with
them. Here we Å¿ee what all the worlde may
<pb facs="tcp:10917:131"/>
iudge of them, and theÅ¿e thinges to bee
true, experience it Å¿elfe doeth teÅ¿tifie. And
if at any time they gaue the people the
worde, which is called of Paul the <hi>Å¿worde
of God,</hi> wherewith all ChriÅ¿tians ought
to fight, and therefore Å¿houlde be common
as well to the laytie as the Cleargie, as
they tearme them: If, I Å¿aye, they gaue
it at any time vnto them, yet they gaue
it as a Å¿worde in the Å¿heath, that is, in the
Latine tongue, wherein they vnderÅ¿toode
nothing at all, contrarie to the expreÅ¿Å¿e
wordes of Paul, Å¿aying, <hi>That all thinges
Å¿houlde bee done to edification in the
Church, and that hee had rather Å¿peake
fiue wordes in a knowen tongue, then
fiue thouÅ¿ande without the vnderÅ¿tanding
of the people, 1. Corinth.</hi> 14. I Å¿aye theÅ¿e
men are guyltie of the death of the Lordes
people, which Å¿ende them out to fight with
their enemies, and yet take awaye their
weapons and Å¿wordes from them, and Å¿o
leaue them naked and bare to the Å¿poyle
of the enemie. This did the Churche of
Rome, when it firÅ¿t tooke away here with
vs the Å¿criptures and worde of God in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliÅ¿h
from the people, and fedde them with
toyes &amp; fables of <hi>Beuis of South Hampton,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10917:131"/>
and Å¿uch like fabulous bookes, which were
inuented by the deuils inÅ¿truments to keepe
the people from reading of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And no maruayle if they did Å¿o, that
is, take away the worde from them: for they
knewe well ynough, that if the people had
the Scriptures in their owne tongue, they
woulde quickly Å¿ee and perceiue their kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
and treacherie, that they Å¿o cloÅ¿ely v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed
in corners. But when they had put out
the candle, they played many Å¿luttiÅ¿h
partes, and no man Å¿awe them, although the
Lorde then winked not at them, but hath
in his good tyme diÅ¿cloÅ¿ed them to their
Å¿hame, his name be prayÅ¿ed therefore. We
Å¿ee then, that this falÅ¿e church of Rome hath
dealt with the Scriptures and the people,
as the PhiliÅ¿tins handled SamÅ¿on, for they
put out his eyes, and then they led him whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they woulde: Å¿o the PapiÅ¿tes, when
they had Å¿ubtilly put out the eyes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in taking from them the light of Gods
worde, and the GoÅ¿pell of ChriÅ¿t: they
brought them where they liÅ¿ted, &amp; made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
beleeue what they woulde. They thought
good to be ill, &amp; ill good, they called Å¿weete
Å¿owre, and Å¿owre Å¿weete: light darkeneÅ¿Å¿e,
and darkeneÅ¿Å¿e lyght: and all becauÅ¿e
<pb facs="tcp:10917:132"/>
they had not the <hi>word, which was the true
light vnto their paths, and a lanterne vnto
their feete, Psal.</hi> 119. Then was it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thought good and godly to goe on pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
to offer to Saintes, to praye to
them, to haue images in Churches, to beare
candles, to kiÅ¿Å¿e the Pax, to goe on proceÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with a thouÅ¿and Å¿uch trumperies, which
we were delited with, as yong children in
toyes and trifles: whereas now we willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>demne them, and are aÅ¿hamed of them,
becauÅ¿e we haue the light, which hath made
them manifeÅ¿t, and Å¿heweth vnto vs, that we
henceforth be no more children, wauering &amp;
caryed about with euery winde of doctrine,
by the deceite of men, and with craftineÅ¿Å¿e,
whereby they lye in wayte to deceyue vs:
<hi>But let vs follow the trueth in loue, and in
all things grow vp into him, which is the
head, that is ChriÅ¿t, Ephes. 4. ver. 14. &amp;</hi> 15.
By theÅ¿e thinges we Å¿ee, that <hi>Rome</hi> is not
the true Church, becauÅ¿e it hath forÅ¿aken
the worde of God, whereby the Church is
gathered together, as men to battell, by the
Å¿ound of a drumme or trumpet. Nowe as
they haue done in the word in mangling it,
Å¿o haue they in like maner corrupted and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the true vÅ¿e of the Sacramentes, both
<pb facs="tcp:10917:132"/>
in adding vnto them, and taking away from
them, not being contented with the Å¿impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
and that order that ChriÅ¿t vÅ¿ed them in.
To BaptiÅ¿me haue they added of their
owne, Å¿pittle, creame, and Å¿alt, with Å¿uch
like traÅ¿h: the cuppe haue they taken away
from the common people, and Å¿ay it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned
for the PrieÅ¿tes onely, when as our
Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t Å¿ayde, <hi>Drinke ye all of this,
Matth.</hi> 26. They Å¿ay, not al, but the PrieÅ¿ts
onely: Å¿o that when ChriÅ¿t Å¿ayth one thing,
they Å¿ay another contrary vnto it. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
they worÅ¿hip the bread, and Å¿ay that it
is turned into the bodie of ChriÅ¿t, &amp; become
God, where they commit both idolatrie, in
worÅ¿hipping a creature, as the bread, and
blaÅ¿phemie, in that they Å¿ay it is God. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then they haue not theÅ¿e marks for their
church, let vs Å¿ee what markes they Å¿hewe
vnto vs. FirÅ¿t they Å¿ay that their <hi>VniuerÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie</hi>
or multitude, is a Å¿igne of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Church:</hi> but this is vtterly falÅ¿e, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
both by the teÅ¿timonies and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Å¿criptures, and alÅ¿o by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
out of them. For firÅ¿t, if multitude
make the Catholike Church, then the
Turkes and Pagans Å¿hall be the Church,
Å¿ooner and before the PapiÅ¿tes, as the euent
<pb facs="tcp:10917:133"/>
doeth Å¿hew, for they are moe in number then
the ChriÅ¿tians, or their pretended Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,
which yet I thinke they will not
graunt to be the Church. But they will Å¿ay,
Among the ChriÅ¿tians the greateÅ¿t number
are the Church. If this be Å¿o, then Å¿ayde
not our Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t truely, when hee
called his Church <hi>a little flocke,</hi> Å¿aying:
<hi>Feare not little flocke, for it is your fathers
pleaÅ¿ure to giue vnto you the kingdome,
Luke</hi> 12. He Å¿houlde haue Å¿ayde, great
flocke, according to the PapiÅ¿tes opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Againe, when one aÅ¿ked our Å¿auiour
ChriÅ¿t, whether there were fewe that
Å¿houlde be Å¿aued: hee anÅ¿wered in effect
that it was Å¿o, Å¿aying, <hi>Striue to enter in
at the Å¿trayte gate, for many, I Å¿aye vnto
you, will Å¿eeke to enter in, and Å¿hall not
be able, Luke</hi> 13. Here ChriÅ¿t Å¿ayeth flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that many, that is, the multitude, Å¿hall
not enter in at heauen gates, which yet
notwithÅ¿tanding muÅ¿t bee Å¿aued, if the
Church, as the aduerÅ¿aries Å¿aye, conÅ¿iÅ¿t
of multitude, for the Church Å¿hall bee Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
Here ChriÅ¿t excludeth multitude from
his Church and kingdome, and in the 7.
of Matthewe, wee Å¿hall Å¿ee that hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
paucitie and the Å¿mall number to bee
<pb facs="tcp:10917:133"/>
an argument of his Church, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
vnto the blinde PapiÅ¿tes, Å¿aying,
<hi>Strayte is the gate, and narrowe is the
way that leadeth vnto life, and fewe there
be that finde it.</hi> Are there fewe that finde
this gate? then are there but fewe of this
Church of ChriÅ¿t. Wherefore wee haue
the more neede to watche, to Å¿triue, and to
contende to be of this Å¿mall companie, for
Å¿urely many are called to the GoÅ¿pell, but
fewe, and very fewe are choÅ¿en. But let
vs Å¿ee the examples of the holy Scripture.
Was not <hi>Noah</hi> onely founde righteous
with his houÅ¿holde before the Lorde, when
the flood was brought in vpon the wicked
worlde? <hi>For all fleÅ¿h had corrupted his
way before God, Genes.</hi> 6. Was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t
multitude in Sodome founde to be of
this Church of God? Surely if it had
bene Å¿o, Sodome had not bene deÅ¿troyed.
But there were not ten righteous men to
bee founde within it, onely Lot with his
wife and two daughters eÅ¿caped the fire,
all the reÅ¿t were wicked, and therefore moÅ¿t
fearefully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sumed with fire and brimÅ¿tone
from heauen, to make others to feare th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>
like Å¿innes, as Saint Peter Å¿ayeth, <hi>Gen.
19. 2. Peter</hi> 2. There came but two into
<pb facs="tcp:10917:134"/>
the promiÅ¿ed lande of Canaan of all the Å¿ixe
hundred thouÅ¿ande men, beÅ¿ide women and
children, that came out of the lande of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
and they were <hi>IoÅ¿ua</hi> and <hi>Caleb:</hi> the
reÅ¿t iuÅ¿tly periÅ¿hed in the wilderneÅ¿Å¿e for
their vnbeliefe and diÅ¿obedience. But let vs
Å¿ee further, when this Church was more
increaÅ¿ed in the times that followed. Was
not <hi>Elias</hi> onely againÅ¿t the foure hundred
falÅ¿e prophetes of <hi>Achab</hi> and <hi>Iezabel? 3.
Reg.</hi> 18. And did not he thinke, that there
had bene none aliue that appertayned vnto
the Lorde, but he onely? And although the
Lorde Å¿ayd vnto him, <hi>that he had reÅ¿erued
vnto himÅ¿elfe Å¿euen thouÅ¿and, that had
not bowed the knee to the idole Baal:</hi> yet
was that to the multitude and number of
y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> wicked that were then in IÅ¿rael? Againe,
was not the kingdom of IÅ¿rael farre
greater then the kingdome of Iuda? and yet
was the true worÅ¿hippe and Å¿eruice of the
Lorde onely with the Iewes in IeruÅ¿alem,
and not in Dan, or Bethel, where were the
golden calues of Ieroboam? Was not <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheas</hi>
in his time onely one Prophete that
was good, againÅ¿t foure hundred lying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
of Achab? He was ouercome there
by multitude, and yet hee had onely the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:134"/>
trueth and worde of the Lorde on his Å¿ide,
3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 22. If wee liÅ¿t to come neerer the
time of ChriÅ¿t vnder the GoÅ¿pell, we Å¿hall
Å¿ee the feweÅ¿t to holde with him. Was not
the whole multitude of the Iewes with
the chiefe Scribes, and PhariÅ¿es, and hye
PrieÅ¿tes againÅ¿t ChriÅ¿t, and condemned
him to death: <hi>crying, Crucifie him, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him, Iohn</hi> 19. Afterwarde in the Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ion
of the Church, wee Å¿hall Å¿ee the
ChriÅ¿tians to bee the Å¿malleÅ¿t number. <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerÅ¿alitie</hi>
then and multitude, is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Catholike Church of ChriÅ¿t:
but rather the contrarie may bee affirmed,
the leaÅ¿t number to be his. Secondly they
will haue Antiquitie to bee a note and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of this Church: If they will Å¿tande
to Antiquitie, and long preÅ¿cript and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of time, euen here alÅ¿o muÅ¿t they
needes fall. For their MaÅ¿Å¿e with her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
was neuer heard of within the Å¿pace
of fiue hundred yeeres at the leaÅ¿t af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ChriÅ¿t, as a godly and learned man
doeth auouche vnto them, which if they
coulde prooue: he woulde haue Å¿ubÅ¿cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
vnto them: and their tranÅ¿Å¿ubÅ¿tantiation
was neuer Å¿poken of, before the Council of
<hi>Lateran:</hi> and Å¿o all their trumpery hath bene
<pb facs="tcp:10917:135"/>
patched together by Popes and Councils
at diuers times. Whereas wee can prooue
our holy Communion euen from ChriÅ¿t
and his ApoÅ¿tles, vÅ¿ing it in the Å¿ame order
with bread and wine in a knowen tongue,
as he did to his ApoÅ¿tles. If their MaÅ¿Å¿e be
of Å¿uch great antiquitie, as they beare vs in
hande, it is great maruayle that the very
name of it can not once be founde or read of
in the Scriptures: but it is an vnknowen
name, for an vnknowen thing. Here we Å¿ee
antiquitie doeth confute them, although an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie
be not alwayes a good argument,
to prooue a matter by. For if it were, then
murder Å¿houlde be good, which is as aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
as Cain the Å¿econde man that was
here vpon the earth. Gen. 4. From the firÅ¿t
king of IÅ¿rael, which was Ieroboam, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that the kingdome was deuided in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons
time) vntill the laÅ¿t king of the
Å¿ame kingdome, which was HoÅ¿hea, the
golden calues were Å¿till mainteyned, which
were erected firÅ¿t of all by Ieroboam, and
continued for the Å¿pace of three hundred
yeeres, or there about. And yet for all
this, was not their religion good, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they receyued it Å¿till by tradition &amp;
cuÅ¿tome from their fathers, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cript
<pb facs="tcp:10917:135"/>
of Å¿o many yeeres. For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
notwithÅ¿tanding did Å¿till reprehende
the idolatrous and wicked kinges for their
Å¿uperÅ¿titious worÅ¿hipping of theÅ¿e calues,
which they Å¿houlde not haue done, if the
argument of our PapiÅ¿tes bee good, to
bring and alleadge their forefathers, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tome,
traditions, Councils, and antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
for then Achab might haue Å¿ayde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Elias, if this be true, why doeÅ¿t thou
reprehende me for this worÅ¿hippe? I haue
receyued it from the firÅ¿t king Ieroboam,
and my fathers haue liued and dyed in it,
and I haue antiquitie to pleade for mee.
But Elias knewe well ynough that this
was no argument, and therefore tooke him
vp Å¿harpely, as we may our PapiÅ¿tes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they haue had their MaÅ¿Å¿es theÅ¿e
Å¿euen or eyght hundred yeeres. Agayne,
if antiquitie or cuÅ¿tome bee a generall
rule to confirme a doctrine in religion,
then myght the Pagans and Ethnikes
haue alleadged agaynÅ¿t the ApoÅ¿tles theÅ¿e
thinges, when they came to preache ChriÅ¿t
IeÅ¿us crucified vnto them, and to alter
their olde religion, wherein they had
continued Å¿o long. Wee Å¿ee then that
<pb facs="tcp:10917:136"/>
antiquitie fauoureth them not at all, neither
yet can they father their Church and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which they haue at Rome, vpon the Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ion
&amp; ordinarie deÅ¿cent of their BiÅ¿hops
and Popes, Å¿eeing trueth goeth not by Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ion
&amp; inheritance, but by the grace and
mercy of God. But if Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of biÅ¿hops,
and hie PrieÅ¿tes, as they fayne, from Peter
to this time, doeth prooue the Church by a
lineall deÅ¿cent to be with them: why then
Å¿hould not the hye PrieÅ¿ts in ChriÅ¿tes time,
as <hi>Annas,</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ananias</hi> in the
time of the ApoÅ¿tles, be the true Church? for
they had their Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion from <hi>Aaron</hi> the
firÅ¿t hie PrieÅ¿t, ordayned by God himÅ¿elfe,
and might haue obiected this to ChriÅ¿t, and
did alÅ¿o, their lineall deÅ¿ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t from Abraham:
and yet they were of the Å¿ynagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
&amp; ChriÅ¿t doeth call them blinde guides,
generation of vipers, hypocrites &amp; fooles,
and doeth not take them for his Church, but
whippeth them all out of it rather. We Å¿ee
then, that Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion is nothing to prooue
the Church by: for then the Scribes,
PhariÅ¿es, and hye PrieÅ¿tes Å¿houlde haue
bene of the Church in ChriÅ¿tes time. They
obiect furthermore <hi>a generall conÅ¿ent</hi> and
agreement, to prooue the Church vnto vs:
<pb facs="tcp:10917:136"/>
but we know that a conÅ¿ent and agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t
without God and this worde, is rather a
conÅ¿piracy, then a conÅ¿ent. But to cut off
this viÅ¿our alÅ¿o in a worde, was not there a
general co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿ent of al the people of y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> Iewes,
with the chiefe elders alÅ¿o, the Scribes, the
PhariÅ¿ees, the hie prieÅ¿ts with Herode and
Pilate, in the time of ChriÅ¿t, to condemne
him, &amp; to crucifie him? For <hi>Luke</hi> reporteth
Å¿aying, <hi>The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> al the multitude cried at once,
Å¿aying, away with him, and deliuer to vs
Barabbas, and the voices of them, and of

here was a whole and vniuerÅ¿all conÅ¿ent &amp;
agreement, and yet for all that, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t
the trueth, euen IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of al trueth. But do they agree among
them Å¿elues? are they not at variance yet
what purgatorie Å¿hould be? Å¿ome appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

And yet Å¿hall we thinke they doe agree, or
that they can not erre, or that theÅ¿e things
aboue rehearÅ¿ed, as multitude, antiquitie,
with cuÅ¿tome, conÅ¿ent, traditions, Å¿ucceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion,
ancient fathers, generall councils, are
Å¿ufficient proofes of the church to bee with
them: Councils haue erred, and bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

They alÅ¿o go about to proue their

haue all erred, &amp; bin deceiued in Å¿ome point
or other, yea euen of doctrine, Å¿o that they
are not to be rules &amp; notes, to knowe this

the Å¿econd mariages of men, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them al (a thing moÅ¿t abÅ¿urde and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious)
no better then fornication. By theÅ¿e
things then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church is not diÅ¿cerned: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is glorie, pompe, honor, riches, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
beauty, and outward Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,
any note of this church of ChriÅ¿t, as
the PapiÅ¿tes will beare vs in hande, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on
of their gliÅ¿tering and glorious church
of Rome. The contrary thinges are
markes of ChriÅ¿ts Churche, as pouertie,
affliction, no Å¿hewe to the eye, or any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
felicitie. For ChriÅ¿t hath Å¿ayde, his
churche Å¿hall be vnder the croÅ¿Å¿e, and not in
any beauty, or gorgeouÅ¿nes to the outward
eye of the worlde. The harlot &amp; Å¿trumpet
<pb facs="tcp:10917:138"/>
goeth moÅ¿t commonly better trimmed and
decked in apparell, then the honeÅ¿t woman
and matrone of an houÅ¿e: &amp; Å¿o is the whoriÅ¿h
church of Rome, it hath all things for to
pleaÅ¿e well the outward Å¿enÅ¿es, &amp; to allure
men vnto her. It hath for the eare, her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
muÅ¿icke, Å¿inging, &amp; piping, &amp; organs,
and ringing of bels, and this in exceÅ¿Å¿e alÅ¿o.
It hath for the noÅ¿e, Å¿weet Å¿mels, frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿enÅ¿e,
and Å¿uch like. For the eyes, it hath to
pleaÅ¿e them, goodly copes, croÅ¿Å¿es of Å¿il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
and golde, pictures of ChriÅ¿t, and many
images of Å¿aintes, with Å¿uch like baggage,
and fooliÅ¿h traÅ¿he: and for the belly to delite
idle lubbers, and loyterers, there was good
chere kept in abbeyes and monaÅ¿teries:
but in the meane Å¿eaÅ¿on, what was all this
to feede the hungry Å¿oules? Å¿urely nothing.
The worde of ChriÅ¿t was then gone from
them, yea, ChriÅ¿t him Å¿elfe was Å¿hut out
with them, and his mother Marie more
Å¿ought to, more prayed to, and more eÅ¿tee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
then he him Å¿elfe. Here were al things
for the body, and by this they would proue
vnto vs, that they were y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> true church. Wel,
if we would know the church, let vs thinke
it to be there where two or three are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together in ChriÅ¿tes name: and howe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:138"/>
Å¿hould they bee gathered together without
his word and commandement? And this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
to y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> Å¿aying of <hi>S. AuguÅ¿tine, If they
will here admit him. He that will knowe,</hi>
Å¿aith he, <hi>which is the true church of ChriÅ¿t,
he can not know it by any other meanes,
then onely by the Å¿criptures.</hi> We Å¿ee here
how reÅ¿olute he is in this caÅ¿e. <hi>Ex homilia
49. operis imperfecti in Matth.</hi> And againe
he Å¿aith, <hi>ChriÅ¿tians willing to receiue the
Å¿tedfaÅ¿tnes of a true faith, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> fly to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to the Å¿criptures. OtherwiÅ¿e, if
they looke vnto other things, they Å¿halbe
offended, and periÅ¿he, not vnderÅ¿tanding
which is the true church, and Å¿o they Å¿hall
fall into the abomination of deÅ¿olation,
which Å¿tandeth in the holy places of the
church.</hi> How we may plainely vnderÅ¿tand
what are the Å¿ignes of the true church, and
what alÅ¿o are the bodies of the church of
AntichriÅ¿t at Rome, euen murdering of the
Å¿aints of ChriÅ¿t, contempt of the word and
Å¿acrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts, worldly proÅ¿peritie, with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of ill men with Å¿worde to defend it.
Furthermore, this church, that it may be
the better knowen of vs, therfore hath it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
and Å¿undry names in the Å¿criptures,
leÅ¿t we Å¿hould be deceiued by y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> falÅ¿e church.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:139"/>
It is called y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> Å¿heepfold of ChriÅ¿t, doing vs
to vnderÅ¿tand, that thoÅ¿e y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> belong to ChriÅ¿t
are gentle as Å¿heepe, &amp; not cruel as wolues:<note place="margin">EÅ¿aie 11.</note>
for they Å¿hall not hurt nor deÅ¿troy in al the
mountayne of my holines, (Å¿aith the Lorde
of hoÅ¿ts) by his Prophet. This name of the
church excludeth y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> bloody church of Rome,
for they are as wolues &amp; cruell beaÅ¿tes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
the Å¿heepe, as well with vs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in Queene Maries dayes, howe
bloodthirÅ¿tie they were, in that the wolues
Å¿lewe Å¿o many of the Å¿heepe of ChriÅ¿t. It is
called the Å¿pouÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿t, therefore they
that giue them Å¿elues to another head and
huÅ¿band, as the falÅ¿e Romanes doe, are not
of this church. It is alÅ¿o compared and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
to the moone, becauÅ¿e the churche
taketh all her light and brightnes of IeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t, the true Å¿unne of righteouÅ¿nes, as
the moone doeth take of the Å¿unne all her
light, which thing the PapiÅ¿tes doe not: for
they aÅ¿cribe not all to ChriÅ¿t, but Å¿ome
things to the Pope, &amp; Å¿ome to them Å¿elues
and others. And as the moone is not alway
viÅ¿ible being in her change, Å¿o is not this
churche to the eye of man, alwayes in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible
Å¿he we, as the proude churche of Rome
is, but hath Å¿ometime warre and aduerÅ¿itie,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:139"/>
Å¿ometime peace &amp; proÅ¿peritie. It is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
like vnto a Å¿hip vpon the Å¿eas toÅ¿Å¿ed
in deede with the waues from one place to
an other, but yet neuer drowned, becauÅ¿e
ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us is in it, and holdeth the Å¿terne
with his hande. TheÅ¿e thinges, vnto the
which the church is likened, doe very well
conuince Rome to be no church of God at
all, for it is alwayes viÅ¿ible to the eie, and in
great wealth and proÅ¿peritie, as <hi>Babylon</hi>
was, &amp; Å¿o it boaÅ¿teth of her Å¿elfe, as Å¿hee did.
It neuer at all mourneth, or is in the pit of
afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> as ChriÅ¿t Å¿aid his church Å¿houldbe,
<hi>Iohn.</hi> 16. And as we reade in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 9.
this church of Rome doth alwayes laugh
and reioyce, and neuer feeleth the rodde,
<hi>which is a token of baÅ¿tards, and Å¿uch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates,
and not of Gods children Heb.</hi>
12. This <hi>true</hi> church of ChriÅ¿t is but one:
<hi>For there is but one mediator, &amp; one huÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and therefore one Å¿pouÅ¿e, and one
body,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> proueth, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 4. and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>vniuerÅ¿all,</hi> becauÅ¿e it is in all partes of
the earth, and the <hi>Lord hath of his church
out of all nations and kinreds &amp; tongues,
Reuel.</hi> 7. Which church yet notwithÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
is deuided into particular churches of
euery cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>trey &amp; kingdom, where as they al
<pb facs="tcp:10917:140"/>
make but one general church. For they are
ioyned together in the Å¿ame Å¿pirite, fayth,
baptiÅ¿me, and Lorde IeÅ¿us, which is one
head to them all. There was a particular
church in the houÅ¿e of <hi>Philemon,</hi> as Paul
reporteth in that epiÅ¿tle, and he alÅ¿o calleth
the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s a church, &amp; others too, vnto
whom he wrote, meaning that they were
Å¿peciall churches of this vniuerÅ¿all church.
And here the ignorance of the PapiÅ¿tes is
Å¿eene and manifeÅ¿ted, which make that to
be general and catholike, which is but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
&amp; Å¿pecial. For although their Rome
were a true church, yet can it not be termed
by any meanes, Catholike, except all the
Å¿aintes and good men aliue vpon the earth
were in it, which can not be. Here the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they
are deceiued in the worde Catholike, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that to bee generall, which is but in
part Å¿o. Paul did neuer write to any church,
which hee called Catholike, for if hee had
meant Å¿o, that Rome had bene the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
church, when hee wrote vnto it, then
could he not properly haue called Corinth
a church at all. The Å¿umme of all that we
haue Å¿aid hitherto, is thus much: that there
is an holy church, whoÅ¿e head is IeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t alone, to this end and purpoÅ¿e called
<pb facs="tcp:10917:140"/>
of God by his woord, that it Å¿hould gloryfie
him for his goodneÅ¿Å¿e. For looke whatÅ¿oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
our God doth, he doth it in y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> behalfe of
his holy church: For this end doeth hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troy
Å¿ometymes mightie kingdomes, and
great Princes, that hee might deliuer his
church, and verily, for this ende doeth hee
keepe and preÅ¿erue Å¿o long this wicked
worlde, vntill the number of his elect be
fulfilled. He neuer deÅ¿troyed any nation,
but it was for his churches Å¿ake. Oh howe
greatly are we then bound to the goodnes
of this our ChriÅ¿t, which worketh Å¿o great
thinges for vs! Å¿hall we not magnifie his
grace? Å¿hal we not yeelde him continuall
thanks, and that in the middeÅ¿t of the great
congregation? Beleeue me deare brethren,
we are elect, ereated, redeemed, iuÅ¿tified,
Å¿anctified, preÅ¿erued dayly by his power, &amp;
Å¿halbe gloryfied in the life to come, with his
holy angels and Å¿aintes, that we Å¿hould Å¿et
forth his praiÅ¿e &amp; glory. And this is y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> thing,
which the bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tle <hi>S. Peter</hi> doth in
his firÅ¿t EpiÅ¿tle the Å¿econd Chapter, Å¿o ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿tly
exhort vs vnto, Å¿aying,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>To the church
of God, the trewe chriÅ¿tians of Pontus,
AÅ¿ia, Cappadocia, Galatia, and Bithynia,</hi>
(and in them to vs all:) <hi>you are</hi> (Å¿ayth he)
<pb facs="tcp:10917:141"/>

hath called you out of darkneÅ¿Å¿e, vnto
his marueilous light.</hi> Doe wee nowe
Å¿hewe foorth his goodneÅ¿Å¿e with thankeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing?
then are we good ChriÅ¿tians, and
Å¿erue to the ende, whereunto the Lord hath
made vs. Are wee not all carefull of this
duety, to praiÅ¿e God his name daily? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we haue then tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed, and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the ende, of our creation
and calling. The praiÅ¿e of God is Å¿uch
a thing, Å¿o hye, and Å¿o excellent, that if
all the Angels in heauen, with their
force and might<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and all the men in earth,
with all their Å¿peach and eloquence, goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to Å¿et it forth and declare it, they Å¿hall
not do it Å¿ufficienly, and as it deÅ¿erueth to
be done. We ought then to do what lieth
in vs: and this thing doth the triumphant
church in heauen, of Angels, and Saints,
teache vs, that we Å¿hould neuer ceaÅ¿e to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his name at al times, as they do, for they
<pb facs="tcp:10917:141"/>
cannot Å¿atiÅ¿fy themÅ¿elues with crying, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

6. And in the Reuelation the fourth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the foure beaÅ¿tes, and the Elders
ceaÅ¿e not day nor night, crying, <hi>Holy,
holy, holy Lorde God almighty, which
was, which is, and which is to come.</hi>
And yet for all this, wee here in earth
can Å¿atiÅ¿fy our Å¿elues, and be contented
to Å¿et foorth his praiÅ¿e, either neuer a
whit, or els Å¿o negligently and by Å¿uch
Å¿tartes, as wee declare, wee haue no
great loue and care thereunto: Å¿o colde is
our zeale in this poynt, and yet moÅ¿t hot
in trifles and vanites, apperteining to
our pleaÅ¿ures &amp; profits in this life. Wee
haue nowe heard (dearely beloued) the
meaning of this article, concerning the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Church,</hi> what it is, and who is
the head of it, what authoritye it hath,
by what Å¿ignes it may bee alwayes
knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> from the <hi>RomiÅ¿h or falÅ¿e Church.</hi>
We haue alÅ¿o declared, that it is called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,</hi>
becauÅ¿e it is not tyed to any time,
<hi>perÅ¿ons,</hi> or <hi>place</hi> whatÅ¿oeuer, but is diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perÅ¿ed
euery where, as Å¿eemeth good to the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:142"/>
Lord. We haue furthermore Å¿hewed vnto
you, what be the markes of it, and what are
not the trewe Å¿ignes of it, and that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿teth
not in multitude of people, but in
weight of trueth. LaÅ¿t of al, we haue made
manifeÅ¿t, to what end y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> Lord hath gathered
a church together vnto himÅ¿elfe here in
earth, which is, that hee may be honoured
and gloryfied in it, accordingly by their
good workes and chriÅ¿tian conuerÅ¿ation.
Now let vs giue thankes to IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,
the head of this Church, in that hee hath
vouchÅ¿afed to make vs the holy members
of it, which were before the firebrandes of
hell, and a generation of Satans broode.
Let vs moreouer prayÅ¿e his name, for as
much as he doth daily preÅ¿erue vs by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
goodnes, and diuine prouidence, in
this Å¿heepefold of his, from all wolues and
rauening beaÅ¿tes, which otherwiÅ¿e would
deuoure vs. And becauÅ¿e he doth feede vs in
it with wholeÅ¿ome &amp; greene paÅ¿tures of his
holye worde, and leadeth vs foorth to the
waters of life and comfort to refreÅ¿he our
Å¿oules, let vs not be vnmindful or vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to him, for this Å¿o great a benefit. Now
let vs moÅ¿t humbly pray vnto him, that he
would vouchÅ¿afe to keepe vs in this church
<pb facs="tcp:10917:142"/>
of his vnto the ende, leÅ¿t we wander and go
aÅ¿tray from it as loÅ¿t Å¿heepe, and beÅ¿eech we
him, that he would continue his graces &amp;
heauenly promiÅ¿es made vnto vs Å¿o libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in his GoÅ¿pel, that from day to day,
we may grow in holines toward him, as
beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>meth this church, vntil the time come,
that our full redemption from him Å¿hall
appeare. This God graunt vnto vs, not for
our Å¿akes, but for ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us Å¿ake, which
hath purchaÅ¿ed al theÅ¿e things for vs, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the
Å¿hedding of his moÅ¿t precious blood vpon
the croÅ¿Å¿e for our Å¿innes. To this Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us
ChriÅ¿t with the father, and the holy
GhoÅ¿t his power, be rendred all praiÅ¿e and
glory, honour, dominion and thankeÅ¿gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the article going next before,
we haue heard what wee haue
to beleeue concerning y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> church,
which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿t: Now
followe the ornaments, and benefits which
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord in mercy doth, &amp; wil beÅ¿towe vpon
this houÅ¿e, which are in number three. 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿io<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
of Å¿innes in this life. 2. ReÅ¿urrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of
our bodyes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> corruption at the laÅ¿t day of
iudgement. 3. And euerlaÅ¿ting happines in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life to come. TheÅ¿e benefites are great &amp;
Å¿o ineÅ¿timable, that wee can not worthyly
conceiue of them, being couered with fleÅ¿h
and bloud: and therefore wee are the leÅ¿Å¿e
thankeful, then otherwiÅ¿e we Å¿hould be, if
we did or could deepely conÅ¿ider of them:
for they are Å¿uch iewels, as the Lord doeth
only beÅ¿tow vpon his children, and none
els, and therefore they are put after the
Church, and communion of Saintes, as
thinges following the Å¿tate of the church
<pb facs="tcp:10917:143"/>
neceÅ¿Å¿arily, for none can haue them, but
Å¿uch as abide in the church, and are true &amp;
liuely members of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, ingraffed
into his body by faith. The firÅ¿t of theÅ¿e
graces is, the remiÅ¿Å¿ion or forgiueneÅ¿Å¿e of
all our Å¿innes. The meaning therefore of
this article for the capacity of the Å¿imple, in
moe wordes is this, I that am a ChriÅ¿tian
doe Å¿tedfaÅ¿tly beleeue, that almighty God
both hath, doeth, and will of his mercie

death and hel, <hi>which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reward of

and Å¿imple meaning of this Article, and
is proued and confirmed vnto vs out
of Å¿criptures, aÅ¿wel of the olde as of
the newe TeÅ¿tame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t. In the 31. of Ieremy
<pb facs="tcp:10917:144"/>
we reade thus, <hi>This Å¿halbe the couenant
that I wil make, with the houÅ¿e of IÅ¿rael
after thoÅ¿e dayes, Å¿aith the Lord, I wil put
my law in their inward partes, and write
it in their heartes, and I wil be their God,
and they Å¿halbe my people. For I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
their iniquitie, &amp; wil remember their
Å¿innes no more.</hi> So likewiÅ¿e, we haue the
proofe of this, in the Å¿econd epiÅ¿tle to the
Corinthians. <hi>Chap. 5. God was in ChriÅ¿t,
and reconciled the world vnto himÅ¿elfe,
not imputing their Å¿innes vnto them.</hi> And
in the Å¿econd to the ColoÅ¿Å¿ians. <hi>Ye which

into the houÅ¿e of the Lord, is by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
away of all our Å¿innes, and becauÅ¿e
we haue nothing to do with God, except
our offences be blotted and wiped out of
his remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce: Let vs a litle I pray you,
(dearely beloued brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in ChriÅ¿t) marke
what we haue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿ider in this article for
our inÅ¿tructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> &amp; edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vnto a godly life.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:144"/>
We Å¿ay here, that we doe beleeue that there
is a remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes, for the children of
God and Å¿eruants of ChriÅ¿t. The firÅ¿t thing
therefore that we ought to learne and beare
in minde vpon this article, is, that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e
and acknowledge moÅ¿t humbly and
meekely our Å¿innes before God. For if we
Å¿ay and graunt a remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes, wee
muÅ¿t alÅ¿o confeÅ¿Å¿e that wee are Å¿inners, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e
wee can not at all haue pardon of
them. Secondly we muÅ¿t co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿ider by whom
this remiÅ¿Å¿ion doeth come vnto vs, and for
whoÅ¿e Å¿ake it is. Thirdly by what meanes
we are made capable and partakers of this
Å¿o great a benefite. As concerning the firÅ¿t
poynt, it is playne and euident that wee are
all of vs miÅ¿erable Å¿inners before GOD,
which looketh vpon the hearts of men, and
tryeth them: For who can iuÅ¿tly and truely
Å¿aye of him Å¿elfe, My heart is cleane, I am
no Å¿inner. Nay, Salomon doeth tell vs,
<hi>that there is not a man that Å¿inneth not,
1. Reg. 8. Eccle.</hi> 7. And Saint Iohn Å¿ayeth
playnely, <hi>that if we Å¿ay we haue no Å¿inne,
we doe but deceyue our owne Å¿elues, and
there is no trueth in vs.</hi> We are begotten,
conceyued, and borne in Å¿inne, we liue and
are brought vp in Å¿inne: and Å¿hall any man
<pb facs="tcp:10917:145"/>
be Å¿o impudent and Å¿hameleÅ¿Å¿e, as to deny
that he is a Å¿inner? God forbid. The ApoÅ¿tle
Å¿ayeth, <hi>All men haue Å¿inned and are deÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of the glorie of God, Rom.</hi> 3. But we
neede not to goe farre for the proofe of this
matter: Our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t hath taught
his to Å¿ay dayly and hourely, euen as long
as they liue, <hi>Forgiue vs our Å¿innes or treÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿es,
Matth.</hi> 6. It is therefore a deuiliÅ¿h
pride and preÅ¿umption to Å¿ay, whoÅ¿oeuer he
be, that he is no Å¿inner: for Å¿urely the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> ChriÅ¿t
can not helpe him, for he came to Å¿aue Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
And yet there are Å¿ome in the world,
and haue bene alÅ¿o, that haue denied this:
So greatly that Satan bewitched them.
Well, if theÅ¿e teÅ¿timonies of Å¿cripture did
not condemne them Å¿ufficiently, yet I am
Å¿ure, their owne heart &amp; conÅ¿ciences Å¿ome
time or other wil accuÅ¿e the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, and their own
mouth witnes againÅ¿t them. Iob telleth vs
this thing plainely in his booke Chap. 9. <hi>If
I would iuÅ¿tifie my Å¿elfe, my owne mouth
would condemne me.</hi> We Å¿ee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that we
are al of vs, euen the beÅ¿t, wretched Å¿inners:
Nowe as we are Å¿inners, Å¿o we muÅ¿t alÅ¿o
learne to confeÅ¿Å¿e and acknowledge theÅ¿e
Å¿innes, otherwiÅ¿e it is to no purpoÅ¿e, if a
man be a Å¿inner, and will not confeÅ¿Å¿e it. If
<pb facs="tcp:10917:145"/>
a man be Å¿icke, and eyther doeth not, or will
not acknowledge it, hee can not lyghtly bee
healed of the PhyÅ¿itian: for he wil not Å¿eeke
vnto him. Except a man feele his wound, he
will not go to the Surgeon: and vnleÅ¿Å¿e a
man be ignorant, and Å¿eeth the want of his
knowledge that he ought to haue, he wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
deÅ¿ire to be further inÅ¿tructed, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe
Å¿till in his ignorance and blindneÅ¿Å¿e.
Who deÅ¿ireth meate, that is not hungry? or
drinke, that is not thirÅ¿tie? or clothes, that
thinketh he hath apparel ynough? My mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is this, It is not ynough for a man to
thinke he is a Å¿inner, vnleÅ¿Å¿e he hath an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿t
and an effectual feeling of his Å¿innes in
his conÅ¿cience, &amp; that they are as an heauy &amp;
grieuous burden vnto him. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> if he come
to ChriÅ¿t, he Å¿hall quickly haue remedy for
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. <hi>For he came not to cal the righteous,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi>
is, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that thought themÅ¿elues ryghteous,
&amp; boaÅ¿ted of it, for in deed there is none righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
before him: <hi>but he came to cal poore
Å¿inners to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce.</hi> And this agreeth with
that notable Å¿aying of Paul, <hi>that ChriÅ¿t
IeÅ¿us came into this world to Å¿aue Å¿inners,
wherof he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>feÅ¿Å¿ed himÅ¿elf to be chiefe, 1.
Tim.</hi> 1. There is a notable place co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cerning
this matter in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth of Luke, where our
<pb facs="tcp:10917:146"/>
Sauiour ChriÅ¿t, entring into the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
of Nazareth to reade and to preach
on the Sabboth day, found y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where it
was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 61. of EÅ¿ay, Å¿aying,
<hi>The Spirit of the Lord is vpon me, becauÅ¿e
he hath anointed me, that I Å¿hould preach
the GoÅ¿pel to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore: he hath Å¿e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t me, that
I Å¿houlde heale the broken hearted, that I
Å¿hould preach deliuerance to the captiues,
and recouering of Å¿ight to the blinde: that
I Å¿houlde Å¿et at libertie them that are bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed,
and that I Å¿houlde preach the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
yeere of the Lord.</hi> This place doeth
Å¿hewe for whom ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us is Å¿ent and is
meete, that is, for the poore, the broken hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the captiues in Å¿inne, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blinde in minde,
the bruiÅ¿ed in pryÅ¿on. If we feele our Å¿elues
to be Å¿uch men, ChriÅ¿t is Å¿ent vnto vs: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e
hee is not for vs. And this is the
cauÅ¿e that made our Sauiour to keepe
companie moÅ¿t commonly with Publicans
and Å¿inners, and Å¿uch as were infected with
great Å¿innes &amp; offences, as Marie Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene,
and Matthew, and Zaccheus: for theÅ¿e
did willingly confeÅ¿Å¿e their Å¿innes vnto
him, and Å¿o he cured them. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Å¿ide hee refuÅ¿ed the company of the
Scribes and PhariÅ¿es, the hie PrieÅ¿tes and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:146"/>
Doctors of the lawe, becauÅ¿e, although they
were Å¿inners, yea, and grieuous Å¿inners
too, yet they had an opinion of holines and
righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e in them Å¿elues, aboue other
men, and iuÅ¿tified them Å¿elues before our
Sauiour ChriÅ¿t, as we Å¿ee in the parable of
<hi>the Publicane and PhariÅ¿e that went vp
both of them to praye into the Temple,
Luk.</hi> 18. TheÅ¿e PhariÅ¿es our Å¿auiour Å¿aide,
they had no neede of the PhyÅ¿ician, becauÅ¿e
they dyd not acknowledge their infirmitie
and weakeneÅ¿Å¿e vnto him. <hi>ChriÅ¿t in deede
is meate, but for the hungry, Iohn</hi> 6. he is
water and drinke, <hi>but for the thirÅ¿tie, EÅ¿ay</hi>
55. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. he is a refreÅ¿hing, but <hi>for them
that are loden and burdened, Matth.</hi> 11.
Doe wee giue almes at any time to a Å¿tout
begger, that although he haue neede, yet
wil not confeÅ¿Å¿e it, and aÅ¿ke his almes gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
acknowledging his pouertie? No
more Å¿urely will the Lorde giue vnto any
Å¿pirituall almes, vnleÅ¿Å¿e wee Å¿hall humble
our Å¿elues before him, with true feeling of
our pouertie and miÅ¿erie. For verely here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we muÅ¿t all of vs bee lyke vnto beggers,
that, to mooue pitie and compaÅ¿Å¿ion, Å¿hewe
not the beÅ¿t thinges they haue, (if they haue
any) but the worÅ¿t, as their ragges, their
<pb facs="tcp:10917:147"/>
Å¿ores, their pouertie and nakedneÅ¿Å¿e: And
this moueth men the Å¿ooner to pitie them.
Dearely beloued in ChriÅ¿t, the caÅ¿e Å¿tandeth
Å¿o, and no otherwiÅ¿e, betweene the Lorde
and vs. If we will get any thing, it is by
falling downe, and humbling our Å¿elues,
and not by vaunting of any thing that is in
vs: for he reÅ¿iÅ¿teth the proude, and giueth
grace to the humble and lowly. Do we not
Å¿ee it Å¿o by experience? Is not the beÅ¿t pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ture
and meddowe grounde in the loweÅ¿t
places and valleyes, and the moÅ¿t barren
grounde in the hygheÅ¿t hilles and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines?
So the graces of the Lorde reÅ¿t in
the lowe Å¿tomacke and heart, and flee from
the hye and loftie minde. Let therefore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hill and mountayne be layde lowe, Luke
3. A notable example of this meeke and
humble confeÅ¿Å¿ion of our Å¿innes, we haue
in the Prophete Dauid, who, although he
were a King, yet when he was reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and reprooued Å¿harpely of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
Nathan for his adulterie and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Å¿ayd, without any replying or chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Prophete, moÅ¿t mildely, <hi>I
haue Å¿inned vnto the Lorde.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he heard incontinently that Å¿weete an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿were
from the Lorde, <hi>The Lorde alÅ¿o
<pb facs="tcp:10917:147"/>
hath put awaye thy Å¿inne, thou Å¿halt not
die,</hi> 2. of Kinges 12. Chapter. This thing
Dauid reporteth of himÅ¿elf in the PÅ¿alme
32. <hi>Then I acknowledged my Å¿inne vnto
the Lorde, neyther hid I mine iniquitie:
For I thought, I will confeÅ¿Å¿e agaynÅ¿t my
Å¿elfe, my wickedneÅ¿Å¿e vnto the Lorde, and
thou forgaueÅ¿t the puniÅ¿hment of my
Å¿inne.</hi> Looke in the PÅ¿alme 51. where hee
deÅ¿cribeth the Å¿ame more at large. This
leÅ¿Å¿on is to be learned of vs all, that when
we commit Å¿inne, we Å¿houlde not cloke our
Å¿inne as the hypocrites doe. Looke vpon
the poore Publicane, and vpon Peter: the
one confeÅ¿Å¿ed them humbly, the other wept
for them moÅ¿t bitterly. And Å¿urely Å¿o dyd
all the good men doe from time to time.
Howe often doe the Prophetes EÅ¿ay and
Daniel confeÅ¿Å¿e their Å¿innes, and the Å¿innes
of the people! Did not Tobiah do the like?
and Paul him Å¿elfe doeth in many places
confeÅ¿Å¿e with griefe of minde, that he was a
perÅ¿ecuter of the Church of ChriÅ¿t, 1. Cor.
15. yea, that he had the relikes of Å¿inne Å¿till
abiding in him, Rom. 7. Yea this confeÅ¿Å¿ion
&amp; acknowledging of our faults, muÅ¿t Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
be made to our neyghbour or brother,
if we haue offended him, and we muÅ¿t, &amp; are
<pb facs="tcp:10917:148"/>
commaunded to Å¿eeke reconciliation at his
handes, as our Sauiour Å¿ayeth, Matth. 5.
<hi>If thou bring thy gift to the altar, &amp; there
reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>breÅ¿t that thy brother hath ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t
thee, leaue there thine offring before
the altar, and goe thy way, firÅ¿t be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to thy brother, and then come and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
thy gift.</hi> And this is that thing that S.
Iames meant in his EpiÅ¿tle 5. Chap. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
your faultes one to another,
and pray one for another, that ye may be
healed:</hi> not Å¿o, that wee allowe any papiÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Å¿hrift, or a vaine confeÅ¿Å¿ion of all our
Å¿innes in the eare of a maÅ¿monging PrieÅ¿t,
which can do vs no good, but rather taketh
an occaÅ¿ion him Å¿elfe to bee ill, when he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the lewde deedes of Å¿ome. But wee
meane, that an agreement is to bee Å¿ought
for, with Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion one to another, if any
man be offended. Neyther doeth this place
of Iames prooue the PopiÅ¿h confeÅ¿Å¿ion, as
they woulde haue it: for hee Å¿peaketh not
here of the PrieÅ¿t, but of all ChriÅ¿tians.
And if Å¿o bee they will haue this place to
prooue it, then muÅ¿t their PrieÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e
as well his Å¿innes to the people, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to him: for Å¿o goe the wordes of the
text, One to another acknowledge your
<pb facs="tcp:10917:148"/>
faultes. NotwithÅ¿tanding if any man feele
him Å¿elfe grieued with his Å¿inne, and clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in his minde and conÅ¿cience, if then hee
reÅ¿ort to his godlie and learned PaÅ¿tor or
preacher in the pariÅ¿he, and tell it vnto him,
to haue comfort and his aduiÅ¿e what to doe,
hee can not iuÅ¿tly for this bee reprehended of
any, becauÅ¿e it is both good and godly. But
to number vp al their Å¿innes to the miniÅ¿ter,
as the papiÅ¿tes woulde haue it, no man can
doe: <hi>for who knoweth howe oft hee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth?</hi>
as Dauid Å¿ayth, PÅ¿alme 19. ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is this thing warranted by any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
or example in Å¿cripture. But to our
purpoÅ¿e: wee Å¿ee then by theÅ¿e thinges, that
as we are Å¿inners all the Å¿ort of vs, Å¿o wee
muÅ¿t not diÅ¿Å¿emble them, if wee truely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende
to haue remiÅ¿Å¿ion of them, but with
our whole heart we ought to confeÅ¿Å¿e them
vnto the Lorde. And here is to bee noted,
that in this article wee doe beleeue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e
a remiÅ¿Å¿ion or forgiueneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿innes,
and not a Å¿atiÅ¿faction of vs for our Å¿innes,
as the aduerÅ¿aries teach, that wee muÅ¿t Å¿atiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
for our Å¿innes, and purchaÅ¿e pardons
from Rome by money, by maÅ¿Å¿es, and Å¿uch
trumperies, as going on pilgrimage bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote,
by faÅ¿tings, and lying in hearecloth.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:149"/>
Surely if theÅ¿e things bee added to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
our Å¿innes, then is not this our article
true, which Å¿ayth, that there is a free remiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion
of Å¿innes without paying any thing at
all of our part, euen as the detter when hee
hath nothing to pay or diÅ¿charge his dette,
Å¿ome godly creditour doeth freely, forgiue
him. Nowe if hee Å¿houlde pay any thing, or
halfe of it, then it is not freely forgiuen, but
partly forgiuen, and partly payde: but Iohn
pronounceth, <hi>that if any man thirÅ¿t, he may
come and take of the well of the water of
life freely,</hi> Reuelation 20. 22. EÅ¿ay 55.
If wee may take away any of our Å¿innes
by Å¿atiÅ¿fying for them, then all is not due
to the blood of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t: but Iohn
Å¿ayth, <hi>that it is the blood of ChriÅ¿te</hi> and
no other thing <hi>that doeth purge vs from
all our Å¿inne.</hi> Wee with all our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
and good deedes can not Å¿atiÅ¿fie Gods
wrath and anger, conceiued for one of the
leaÅ¿t of our offences: for the leaÅ¿t Å¿inne that
we committe, deÅ¿erueth euerlaÅ¿ting hell
fire: and howe then can wee Å¿atiÅ¿fie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
wee bee freely forgiuen? This Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
well vnderÅ¿toode, Å¿aying, <hi>If thou, O
Lord, Å¿traitly markeÅ¿t iniquities, O Lorde,
who may Å¿tande?</hi> but marke what Dauid
<pb facs="tcp:10917:149"/>
addeth, and it confirmeth our poÅ¿ition and
purpoÅ¿e: <hi>but mercie</hi> (Å¿aith hee) <hi>is with thee,
that thou maieÅ¿t be feared,</hi> PÅ¿al. 130. Hee
declareth vnto vs Å¿ufficiently, that wee can
not bee iuÅ¿tified before the moÅ¿t pure God,
but by forgiueneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿innes: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pronounced that man bleÅ¿Å¿ed that had
his Å¿innes forgiuen, not that had Å¿atiÅ¿fied for
them. Our Å¿auiour doeth teach his to pray
in humilitie, <hi>Forgiue vs our Å¿innes,</hi> and not
to Å¿ay, Giue vs grace or might to Å¿atiÅ¿fie for
them. Thus much for the firÅ¿t poynt, that
if wee will haue pardon of our Å¿innes, wee
muÅ¿t firÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e and acknowledge them:
for what Å¿hould God forgiue vs, if we were
not Å¿inners? The Å¿econde thing to conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in this article, is to knowe to whome to
come vnto for the forgiueneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿innes,
and for whoÅ¿e Å¿ake they are remitted, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e
to knowe and beleeue a remiÅ¿Å¿ion of
Å¿innes, is in vaine: for as it is booteleÅ¿Å¿e for
a man that is very hungrie, to knowe and
beleeue there is meate in the worlde, except
he knew the place &amp; the man that had it for
him, that he might reÅ¿ort vnto him: and as
it is in vayne to confeÅ¿Å¿e thy diÅ¿eaÅ¿e and
Å¿ickenÅ¿Å¿e, vnles thou know Å¿ome good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿icion
who may helpe thee: Å¿o Å¿urely it Å¿hall
<pb facs="tcp:10917:150"/>
profite vs nothing at all to knowe or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e
our Å¿innes, if wee bee ignorant of the
mediatour that Å¿hould take them away: yea,
if the Å¿icke perÅ¿on Å¿houlde Å¿eeke out Å¿uch a
PhyÅ¿ition, as either could not or would not
cure him, his labour alÅ¿o were vnprofitable,
and all one, as if the needy man Å¿houlde goe
to one for an almes, that is as needy as hee
him Å¿elf. Let vs therefore take diligent heede
to this, that being Å¿icke of our Å¿innes in our
Å¿oules, we goe and runne to Å¿uch a cunning
PhyÅ¿ition, as we are Å¿ure both can and will
for his abilitie and compaÅ¿Å¿ion cure and
heale our infirmities, and hath a Å¿alue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Å¿ore and maladie. This cure and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿icke
for all diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, reÅ¿teth not in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
whatÅ¿oeuer, no not in the Angels: for
they neede a mediatour to holde them al vp,
not in the Saintes: for eyther they are all
Å¿inners, as thoÅ¿e aliue here in the earth, or
els haue bene all Å¿inners, as they in heauen,
and therefore neede a mediatour as well as
wee. There is no creature therefore in this
great cure of Å¿innes, that can doe vs any
good: nay rather wee Å¿hall be woorÅ¿e and
woorÅ¿e, runnyng to them, as the woman in
the GoÅ¿pell was with the iÅ¿Å¿ue of blood, Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vnto PhiÅ¿itions, vntill Å¿hee came to
<pb facs="tcp:10917:150"/>
ChriÅ¿t, who cured her immediatly, Luke 8.
for he is only the good PhyÅ¿ition, that came
to cure our deadly woundes, Matthewe
9. Will yee then knowe who this is that
onely forgiueth Å¿innes? Marke what the
holy GhoÅ¿t Å¿aith, Ioh. 1. <hi>Behold the lambe
of God that taketh away the Å¿innes of the
worlde.</hi> Who is this onely lambe of God,
but IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t the Å¿onne of GOD, Å¿laine
from the beginning of the worlde for the
Å¿innes of the people? <hi>for there is but one
mediatour betweene God &amp; man, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,</hi> 1 Timo. 2. <hi>and he hath giuen
him Å¿elfe a ranÅ¿ome for all.</hi> If this bee Å¿o,
we may boldely come vnto him at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
eÅ¿pecially when hee calleth,
<hi>Come vnto mee all yee that doe labour
and are laden, and I will refreÅ¿h you,</hi> Matt.
11. The whole Å¿criptures both of the newe
and olde teÅ¿tament doe propounde no other
redeemer vnto vs, then IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. All
the Å¿acrifices were figures of remiÅ¿Å¿ion of
Å¿innes by ChriÅ¿t alone: for it was vnpoÅ¿Å¿ible
(as the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith,) that the blood of
goates and calues Å¿houlde take away Å¿inne:
but yet Å¿innes were taken away vnder the
lawe. It remayneth therefore, that they
Å¿houlde bee taken away by ChriÅ¿t: for Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<pb facs="tcp:10917:151"/>
reioyced to Å¿ee his day, and Å¿awe it
gladly, Iohn 8. There was but one temple,
but one hie prieÅ¿t, but one altar: Å¿o there is but
one ChriÅ¿t to men, to take away Å¿innes: for
all theÅ¿e thinges were Å¿hadowes of him.
He is the true temple, in whome wee muÅ¿t
pray, the hie prieÅ¿t that offereth his body for
vs, and the true altar, vpon whom we muÅ¿t
offer all our Å¿acrifices of prayer and
thankeÅ¿giuing, if wee will haue them to
pleaÅ¿e God, and to be accepted of him. Wee
haue (Å¿aith the holy ghoÅ¿t) an altar (meaning
ChriÅ¿t:) whereof they haue no authoritie
to eate, which Å¿erue in the tabernacle, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the vnbeleeuing Iewes. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by him offer the Å¿acrifice of praiÅ¿e al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to God, that is, <hi>the fruite of the lips,
which confeÅ¿Å¿e his name,</hi> Hebrews. 13.
Our Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t, when he Å¿ent forth his
apoÅ¿tles to preach, willed not them to preach
remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes, but <hi>in his name onely,</hi>
Luke 24. and this doeth Peter in the Actes
declare vnto vs chapter 10. <hi>Through his
name euery one y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doth beleue, Å¿hal receiue
remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿ins.</hi> Healings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body were
done &amp; wrought in his name by y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> ApoÅ¿tles,
Actes 5. and therefore the clenÅ¿ing and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:10917:151"/>
of the Å¿oule, which is by remiÅ¿Å¿ion
of our Å¿innes, is much more to be looked for
at his hands. And as it was in Egypt, in the
great dearth and famine of corne, none could
haue any food of <hi>Pharao</hi> the king, but by the
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ds of IoÅ¿eph, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he had made ouerÅ¿eer &amp;
ruler of the land in his name (for when they
cryed to him for breade, he Å¿ayde, <hi>Goe yee
to IoÅ¿eph, and what he Å¿ayth to you, do ye,</hi>
GeneÅ¿is 41.) Å¿o it is nowe in the famine and
dearth of our Å¿oules for Å¿pirituall foode, we
can haue nothing to feed our hungry Å¿oules
from the king of heauen, but by the meanes
of the true IoÅ¿eph, which is IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,
who is ordeined of his father to rule and
gouerne all thinges in his name, Å¿o that
hee Å¿endeth vs to his Sonne, when wee
aÅ¿ke any thing of him, for in him hee is wel
pleaÅ¿ed, and for his Å¿ake onely and for no
mans elÅ¿e, doeth hee beÅ¿towe this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
vpon vs: for GOD hath in
deede giuen lyfe vnto the worlde, but
this lyfe is in his Sonne, that all Å¿hould
honour the Sonne, as they honour
the Father. And as among the IÅ¿raelites
none coulde bee healed that were
Å¿tung of the fyerye Serpentes, but all
<pb facs="tcp:10917:152"/>
Å¿uch as looked vp to the braÅ¿en Serpent
which MoÅ¿es made: Å¿o it is as certaine, that
none can bee deliuered from the Å¿tinging of
the olde Å¿erpent which is the deuill, but they
that looke vp to the Å¿onne of God on hie in
heauen, they haue redemption by his blood,
that is, the remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes, EpheÅ¿ians 1.
<hi>There is no other name vnder heauen,
wherein we muÅ¿t be Å¿aued,</hi> no other fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
whereupon wee muÅ¿t builde vp into
heauen, no other Å¿tone that coupleth the
building together, no other key that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> gates vnto vs, but IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,
Reuelation. 5. <hi>Except therefore we beleeue
that it is he that taketh away all our Å¿innes,
wee Å¿hall die in them,</hi> Iohn. 8. Neither is
this doctrine onely confirmed vnto vs by
the authorities of the worde, but alÅ¿o by the
examples of all the godly. Dauid was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
in the way of the Lord, but to whom
doth he goe for knowledge? <hi>Teach me, O
Lorde,</hi> (Å¿aith hee) <hi>the way of thy Å¿tatutes,</hi>
PÅ¿alme 119. Neither Å¿hall ye reade, that he
went at any time to any other, in that his
whole booke of prayers &amp; thankeÅ¿giuings,
Å¿aue onely to the Lorde: he did knowe well
ynough, that all other Å¿cholemaÅ¿ters were
vnlearned and domme, and as Idoles that
<pb facs="tcp:10917:152"/>
could not Å¿peake. The woman of Canaan
went at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firÅ¿t to ChriÅ¿t, to haue her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cured. Saint Paul praied <hi>to the Lorde,
to haue the meÅ¿Å¿enger of Satan to depart
from him, 2. Cor.</hi> 12. Neither can there be
any example brought of any, that euer he
went to any other then to the Lord onely, to
haue his Å¿innes and offences taken awaye.
By this, that our Å¿innes are forgiuen in
ChriÅ¿t alone, we learne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we of our Å¿elues
by nature are hatefull vnto God, before we
bee reconciled vnto him by the death of his
Sonne: Å¿o that except he behold and looke
vpon our Å¿innes in the face and countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce
of IeÅ¿u ChriÅ¿t, wee are but caÅ¿tawayes.
Wherefore (brethren) let vs looke vnto it,
that wee may perÅ¿wade, not men, but our
owne Å¿elues, not in tongue and mouth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but in heart and deede, that we are Å¿urely
members of ChriÅ¿t. Furthermore we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by this, that the <hi>PapiÅ¿t,</hi> the <hi>Turke,</hi> the
<hi>Iewe,</hi> haue all gone aÅ¿tray, for they Å¿eeke for
remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes by other meanes, then
by the death of ChriÅ¿t. The <hi>PapiÅ¿t</hi> by his Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿factorie
woorkes of his owne deuice, by
pardons from the Pope, when as no man
can forgiue Å¿innes, but God onely: by his
praying to Angels, to Saints, whome he
<pb facs="tcp:10917:153"/>
maketh interceÅ¿Å¿ors and mediators to God,
and Å¿o leaueth the waters of life ChriÅ¿t Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us,
and diggeth Å¿uch broken pittes and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ternes,
as can holde no water at all. I Å¿ee
not therefore howe hee can haue remiÅ¿Å¿ion
of his Å¿innes, Å¿eeing he Å¿eeketh it els where
then in the blood of ChriÅ¿t, and of ChriÅ¿t
alone, for they giue Å¿omething vnto him,
but not all, and Å¿o they make him but halfe
a Å¿auiour. But eyther hee will bee a whole
Sauiour vnto them, that hee may haue
all the glorie and prayÅ¿e, or elÅ¿e he will be
none at all. ChriÅ¿t can not abide any thing
to be ioyned with him, in the way to Å¿alua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and euerlaÅ¿ting life, but he will bee
the onely and whole Sauiour to men.
The <hi>Turke</hi> that hateth this name of ChriÅ¿t,
and goeth not about to haue remiÅ¿Å¿ion of
Å¿innes by it, can clayme no part in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of the kingdome of heauen: hee
thinketh to bee Å¿aued by God the Father,
when hee honoureth not God the Sonne.
Agayne, he truÅ¿teth to his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and
his falÅ¿e prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and forÅ¿aketh
the true and euerlaÅ¿ting Prophete IeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t, whome God Å¿ent into the worlde,
to giue life vnto it. They can Å¿aye, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in God the Father Almightie,</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:10917:153"/>
they will not confeÅ¿Å¿e that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t the onely Sonne of
God, and therefore they are not vnder the
Couenaunt of grace and Å¿aluation, but
Å¿tande all accurÅ¿ed before the lyuing Lorde,
as beyng without ChriÅ¿t. Thirdly, the
Iewes can haue or looke for no remiÅ¿Å¿ion
of Å¿innes, becauÅ¿e they haue reiected this
ChriÅ¿t, and go about to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h their owne
righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e by the workes of the Lawe,
whereas ChriÅ¿t is the full ende or perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lawe, <hi>for righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one that beleeueth, Rom.</hi> 10. They
haue a zeale, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and thinking to bee Å¿aued by the
Lawe, they all Å¿tande accurÅ¿ed, and alÅ¿o
accurÅ¿ed iuÅ¿tly by the Law before the Lord,
<hi>For curÅ¿ed</hi> (Å¿ayeth he) <hi>is he that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not in all thinges that are written in
this booke to doe them, Galat.</hi> 3. They
are detters then (without ChriÅ¿t) to keepe
and perfourme the whole Lawe perfitly
and abÅ¿olutely vnto the Lorde, which no
man can doe, no not they, and therefore
(without a Sauiour) they Å¿tande in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erable
caÅ¿e, euen in the Å¿tate of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting
damnation and perdition. And laÅ¿t of
all, the falÅ¿e and Hypocriticall ChriÅ¿tian,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:154"/>
which profeÅ¿Å¿eth with his mouth, that hee
knoweth and beleeueth in ChriÅ¿t, and yet
vtterly denyeth him in his whole life &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿ation,
can hope for no remiÅ¿Å¿ion of his
Å¿innes, continuing Å¿till as he doeth in diÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and all kinde of abominations.
But the Lord hath dyed for Å¿inners you wil
Å¿aye, and great and notorious sinners too:
trueth it is, he hath done Å¿o, but yet they are
Å¿uch Å¿inners as repent and are Å¿ory for their
former Å¿innes, they lead not their life in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie
Å¿innes, Å¿o that they Å¿houlde delite &amp;
dwel in Å¿inne: but they continue in the feare
of the Lord. Briefely, they are penitent Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and not obÅ¿tinate and wilfull perÅ¿ons,
that can not repent, for whom the Lord hath
died. If we feele our Å¿elues to be Å¿uch trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Å¿inners, the Lorde hath a free remiÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Å¿innes for vs, whenÅ¿oeuer we come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: for to <hi>whom doth the Lord looke?
Euen to him that is poore, &amp; of a contrite
Å¿pirit, and trembling at his wordes.</hi> But he
that hardeneth his heart, and goeth on Å¿till
in his former wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, without remorÅ¿e
of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿cience at al, he heapeth vp wrath vnto
himÅ¿elfe againÅ¿t the daye of wrath, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his Å¿innes Å¿o heauie vnto himÅ¿elfe, that
they will preÅ¿Å¿e him downe to hell. TheÅ¿e
<pb facs="tcp:10917:154"/>
men muÅ¿t amend their ill liues, and be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
Å¿ory for their Å¿innes, not in hypocriÅ¿ie,
as <hi>Pharao</hi> was, who Å¿aid, I haue Å¿inned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lorde: neither in deÅ¿peration, as Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,
who repented, but not in faith. But
herein let them followe Dauid in the olde
TeÅ¿tament, and Peter in the Newe, who
repented, and wept moÅ¿t bitterly, but yet in
hope, &amp; had remiÅ¿Å¿ion of their Å¿innes. TheÅ¿e
men by their repentance, afterwarde chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and altered their olde liues and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ation,
their olde man with his maners was
put off, and the newe man, which after God
was created in righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e,
was foorthwith put on, and Å¿o they
walked all their dayes afterward in a newe
life. Many men can Å¿ay now a daies: Oh, I
nowe repent, I am Å¿ory for my Å¿innes, &amp; yet
by and by, or the next daye, they fall to the
Å¿ame or like Å¿innes againe. Shal we thinke
Å¿uch men repent? nay verely, they deceyue
but themÅ¿elues and the worlde, for God
they can not deceiue. Repentance is in the
heart, and not in the mouth, for it is a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and chaunging of the minde from ill
to good. As long therefore as we Å¿ee their
liues not to bee at all chaunged, wee may
boldely Å¿aye, they repent not truely, and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:155"/>
therefore<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes is excluded
from them. Hee that repenteth truely,
altereth his wicked life, as wee Å¿ee it came
to paÅ¿Å¿e in Paul, who, after that hee was
called, and repented of his former life,
neuer returned agayne to perÅ¿ecute the
Church of ChriÅ¿t, neyther did hee liue
as before hee did. Well, to conclude
this part, if this remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes come
vnto vs by ChriÅ¿t, let vs be Å¿ure to bee in
his loue, let vs not profane his holy name
by our vile blaÅ¿phemies in our mouthes
dayly, as the wicked doe: but <hi>let euery
one that calleth vpon this name, depart
from all iniquitie, 2. Timothie 2. chapter.</hi>
The thirde thing to bee conÅ¿idered in this
remiÅ¿Å¿ion of our Å¿innes, was as I Å¿ayde
before, the <hi>meanes</hi> by the which it may
bee applyed vnto vs, and receyued from
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t the authour of it. For vnleÅ¿Å¿e
wee alÅ¿o knowe this, it is to no purpoÅ¿e
to knowe the former two poyntes. And
this may bee made playne vnto vs by this
Å¿imilitude. The poore man that is an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred,
although hee knowe whyther to goe
to Å¿ome riche man or other for his meate
and almes, yet except he vnderÅ¿tand, what
meanes and waye to vÅ¿e to obtayne this
<pb facs="tcp:10917:155"/>
reliefe of the riche man, all is in vayne:
for if he Å¿hould vÅ¿e Å¿toute and Å¿turdy words,
when hee ought to be gentle, or if he Å¿hould
commaunde it, when hee Å¿houlde intreate
for it, hee were not like to Å¿peede, or if
the riche man did offer him meate to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
with the hande, and hee put foorth
his foule feete to receyue it, it were a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
prepoÅ¿terous order, and Å¿uch a thing
as myght iuÅ¿tly cauÅ¿e this man to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
his liberalitie from him: Å¿o Å¿urely
the caÅ¿e Å¿tandeth betweene our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us
ChriÅ¿t, the Prince of all heauenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ures,
and vs poore Å¿inners and wretches.
Albeit we well perceyue, that hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion
of Å¿innes for vs, yet wee muÅ¿t
knowe the waye to pleaÅ¿e him, when wee
come to haue our Å¿ute obtayned. And this
waye to pleaÅ¿e him, and to take the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
that hee offereth, is onely faith in his
name. <hi>For without faith it is vnpoÅ¿Å¿ible
to pleaÅ¿e him. For he that commeth vnto
him, muÅ¿t beleeue that he is, and that
hee is a rewarder of all them that Å¿eeke
him,</hi> as Å¿ayth the holy GhoÅ¿t the eleuenth to
the Hebrewes. When therefore the Lorde
IeÅ¿us offereth this great benefite of Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
vnto vs, in the free remiÅ¿Å¿ion
<pb facs="tcp:10917:156"/>
of all our Å¿innes, wee muÅ¿t not offer out
to him our foule feete, that is to Å¿aye, our
woorkes, which are with many Å¿innes pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
and defiled: for Å¿o wee myght cauÅ¿e
him to bee angrie with vs, and to keepe
backe his gracious benefites. But we muÅ¿t
as he hath commaunded, and alwaies in the
GoÅ¿pell requireth, when he is about to doe
vs any good, beleeue onely in him, that is,
offer vnto him our hande, that is, true faith,
which is a fitte thing and inÅ¿trument to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
his bleÅ¿Å¿inges. Neyther is this our
Å¿aying, but the phraÅ¿e and maner of Å¿peache
in the Scriptures. Our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t
did neuer any miracle or cure vpon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of men, but hee required faith of them,
and they being healed, hee alwayes attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
it to the faith and confidence that they
had in him, and not to any good worke of
theirs. In the ninth chapter of the GoÅ¿pel
after Saint Matthews, wee reade there, of
a very charitable deede of foure men, that
brought one being Å¿icke of the palÅ¿ie to our
Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t, as hee laye on his bed: but
what Å¿ayde our Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t concerning
this? <hi>IeÅ¿us Å¿eeing their faith, Å¿ayde to the
Å¿icke of the palÅ¿ie, Sonne, be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
thy Å¿innes are forgiuen thee.</hi> You Å¿ee
<pb facs="tcp:10917:156"/>
howe that the cure of the man is aÅ¿cribed
to their faith, and not to their good workes.
LikewiÅ¿e two blinde men came vnto him
to be healed, crying, and Å¿aying, <hi>O Å¿onne of
Dauid, haue mercie vpon vs.</hi> This verily
was a good confeÅ¿Å¿ion, and worke of them,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 9. But what Å¿ayeth hee vnto them?
<hi>Beleeue ye that I am able to doe this? they
Å¿ayde, Yes. Then Å¿ayeth he, According to
your faith be it vnto you.</hi> The woman that
was deliuered from the bloodie yÅ¿Å¿ue, heard
this of him: <hi>Daughter, be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
thy faith hath made thee whole, Matt.</hi>
9. When he rayÅ¿ed vp the rulers daughter,
he required but onely faith of him, which
thing the PapiÅ¿tes Å¿aye, we can not prooue
out of the Scripture. In the eight of Luke
therefore this worde onely is put, to exclude
all other things: for (Å¿aith he) <hi>Beleeue only,
&amp; Å¿he Å¿halbe Å¿aued.</hi> Now if ChriÅ¿t require
this faith in the cure of the externall man,
that is, of the bodie, which is the leÅ¿Å¿e thing,
hee doeth much more require it in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the inner man, the Å¿oule, which is
the greater cure, and of more valewe. You
haue then heard, that faith in ChriÅ¿t cureth
the body: heare nowe alÅ¿o, that ChriÅ¿t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
faith eÅ¿pecially to beleeue in him to
<pb facs="tcp:10917:157"/>
euerlaÅ¿ting life. The GoÅ¿pell written by
Saint Iohn is full of this matter almoÅ¿t
in euery Chapter. Speaking of ChriÅ¿t, he
Å¿ayeth on this wiÅ¿e, <hi>He came among his
owne, and his owne receyued him not,
but as many as receyued him, to them he
gaue prerogatiue to be the Å¿onnes of God,
euen to them that beleeue in his name,
Iohn</hi> 1. Againe, <hi>So God loued the world,
that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne,
that whoÅ¿oeuer beleeueth in him, Å¿hould
not periÅ¿h, but haue euerlaÅ¿ting life, Ioh. 3.
He that beleeueth in him, is not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but he that beleeueth not, is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
already, becauÅ¿e he hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
in the name of the onely begotten
Sonne of God.</hi> In the fift of Iohn, our
Å¿auiour Å¿aith, <hi>Verely, verely I Å¿ay vnto you,
he that heareth my worde, and beleeueth
him that Å¿ent me, hath euerlaÅ¿ting life, and
Å¿hall not come into condemnation, but
hath paÅ¿Å¿ed from death to life.</hi> The Å¿ixte
chapter is full of Å¿uch godly and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Å¿ayings: <hi>I am that bread of life, he that
commeth vnto me, Å¿hal neuer hunger, and
he that beleeueth in me, Å¿hall neuer thirÅ¿t.
Verely, verely I Å¿ay vnto you, he that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
in me, hath euerlaÅ¿ting life. TheÅ¿e
<pb facs="tcp:10917:157"/>
things are written, that ye might beleeue
that IeÅ¿us is ChriÅ¿t the Sonne of God, &amp; in
beleeuing ye might haue life through his
name, Ioh.</hi> 20. It were infinite to recite all
the places in Scripture that make for this
matter, and I Å¿hould be tedious, if I would
rehearÅ¿e them all. Notable is that place in
the Å¿ixtenth chapter of the Actes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles,
where the Iayler demandeth of Paul
and Silas, <hi>what he Å¿hould doe to be Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
&amp; they anÅ¿wered forthwith, Beleeue
in the Lord IeÅ¿us, and thou Å¿halt be Å¿aued,
and all thine houÅ¿e.</hi> I referre them that liÅ¿t
to Å¿ee moe places, to the <hi>Actes 3, 10, &amp;</hi> 13.
chapt. <hi>Rom. 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11. chapters. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheÅ¿.</hi>
2. Out of theÅ¿e wordes wee gather
this doctrine for vs, that all the graces
and benefites of ChriÅ¿t are made ours by
faith in his blood, and by faith onely wee
take holde and laye hande vpon them, for
faith is as it were an hand, or a mouth open,
to receiue meate into the Å¿oule, and to feede
it. We muÅ¿t then open our hande, and our
mouth to receyue him: as Dauid Å¿ayeth in
his PÅ¿almes, Å¿peaking in the perÅ¿on of
God: <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which haue
brought thee out of the land of Egypt, ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
thy mouth wide, and I will fill it, PÅ¿al.</hi> 81.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:158"/>
In that place the Lorde accuÅ¿eth the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie
of the IÅ¿raelites, that did not open
their mouthes in faith, to receiue his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
in Å¿uch obedience, as he powreth them
out. Againe, if faith bee the meane to bee
made partaker of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
him to vs, to heale our diÅ¿eaÅ¿es: then on
the other Å¿ide, incredulitie of man is the
Å¿toppe or hinderance that letteth the Lord,
to powre down his bleÅ¿Å¿ings vpon vs. This
lacke of faith doeth Å¿hut vp his beneuolence
and good will from vs, Å¿o that hee can not
open heauen gates vnto vs, and powre vs
downe his bleÅ¿Å¿ing. Of this the Prophets
complayned in the olde time, both EÅ¿ai and
Ieremie: <hi>Behold</hi> (Å¿ayeth EÅ¿ai) <hi>the Lords
hand is not Å¿hortened, that it can not Å¿aue,
neyther is his eare heauie, that it can not
heare, but your iniquities haue made a
Å¿eparation betweene you and your God,
and your Å¿innes haue hid his face from
you, that he will not heare, EÅ¿a. chap.</hi> 59.
So Ieremie in his fift Chapter: <hi>Your
Å¿innes haue hindered good thinges from
you.</hi> And what Å¿inne or iniquitie can bee
greater, or more deteÅ¿table before the Lord,
then the Å¿inne of incredulitie and vnbeliefe,
euen the mother and fountaine of all other
<pb facs="tcp:10917:158"/>
Å¿innes? This is that which the EuangeliÅ¿t
Saint Matthewe reprehendeth in the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarites,</hi>
euen their incredulitie: for when
our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t came among them to
preach, and teache, and to heale them that
were Å¿icke, as hee did in other places, they
were offended with him, and gaue him iuÅ¿t
occaÅ¿ion to Å¿aye of them, <hi>That a Prophete
was not without honour, Å¿aue in his owne
countrey, and in his owne houÅ¿e.</hi> Then is
it added in the ende of the Chapter, <hi>He did
not many great workes there, for their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefes
Å¿ake, Matth.</hi> 13. So likewiÅ¿e our
Sauiour ChriÅ¿t Å¿ayeth to the father of the
childe that was lunatike, conÅ¿idering his
want of faith: <hi>If thou couldeÅ¿t</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
all thinges were poÅ¿Å¿ible to him that
beleeueth, Marke</hi> 9. And this is the onely
cauÅ¿e that barred the IÅ¿raelites out of the
land of Canaan: <hi>For we Å¿ee that they could
not enter in, becauÅ¿e of vnbeliefe, Hebr.</hi> 3.
No more Å¿hall any enter at all into heauen,
which was figured by the holy lande of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
which beleeue not: for Iohn Å¿ayeth,
<hi>that all the vnbeleuing Å¿hal haue their part
in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>

                        </gap>hich is the Å¿econd death, Reue.</hi> 21.
Nowe when wee Å¿aye, that faith alone in
<pb facs="tcp:10917:159"/>
ChriÅ¿t doeth applie all his good workes
vnto vs, wee doe not Å¿peake againÅ¿t good
workes, that are done of the godly here in
this life, but our meaning is, that our good
deedes doe not Å¿aue vs, which any man that
hath read the Scriptures indifferently, wil
graunt. Wee exclude not workes in life
and maners here before men, but wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> any part or portion of iuÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
before the almightie God, in whoÅ¿e
preÅ¿ence nothing is perfite, cleane or pure,
no not the Å¿unne, nor the moone, nor the
Angels: but onely the works of that imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
and vnÅ¿potted Lambe, euen the man
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, whoÅ¿e woorkes are all made
ours, and imputed vnto vs, as if wee had
done them, if wee doe but beleeue in him.
Good workes muÅ¿t bee done of vs, for theÅ¿e
three cauÅ¿es: firÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e God hath <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>
them, Å¿econdly, becauÅ¿e he is <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
by them,</hi> as our Sauiour Å¿ayeth
Matthewe the fift, <hi>Let your light Å¿o Å¿hine
before men, that they may Å¿ee your good
workes, and glorifie your Father which
is in heauen.</hi> Thirdly, they muÅ¿t be done,
becauÅ¿e they <hi>profite</hi> and further our poore
neyghbours and brethren, the needy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and in helping
<pb facs="tcp:10917:159"/>
them, wee helpe IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 25. For Å¿o doeth hee account it
as done to himÅ¿elfe. You may adde to theÅ¿e
a fourth cauÅ¿e, why good workes are to
bee done, although they Å¿aue vs not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e
they Å¿hall bee Å¿ignes and tokens to
men of our faith, which is hid and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
vs, and Å¿hall declare that we are good
ChriÅ¿tians, euen as the tree is knowen
by his fruite: for if wee haue no good
workes, Å¿urely wee haue no good faith,
but a deuils faith, as Iames Å¿ayeth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
wee bragge neuer Å¿o much of our
faith. This faith doeth not Å¿aue, but is a
dead faith, without any workes. The true
faith that wee Å¿pake of before, it doeth not
Å¿aue vs, in reÅ¿pect of the worthineÅ¿Å¿e or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of it, but becauÅ¿e it doeth looke vnto
ChriÅ¿t his marke or obiect, and doeth appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende
him with his workes. The PapiÅ¿tes
Å¿aye, that faith alone can not iuÅ¿tifie vs,
becauÅ¿e it is vnperfect, as wee Å¿ay workes
are, which therefore can not Å¿aue vs. But
we muÅ¿t vnderÅ¿tand that the reaÅ¿on is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like:
for we may haue a true &amp; a liuely faith
in ChriÅ¿t, although it be not in euery poynt
perfit &amp; abÅ¿olute. No man can haue a perfit
<pb facs="tcp:10917:160"/>
faith in this life, for it doeth Å¿til increaÅ¿e, and
growe in greater meaÅ¿ure: but the children
of God, they haue and may haue a true faith
cleanÅ¿ed from hypocriÅ¿ie and diÅ¿Å¿imulation.
And this true faith doeth iuÅ¿tifie euery one
that looketh vp to ChriÅ¿t, as well as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
faith. Faith is likened to an hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a man doeth receiue any thing. Now we
knowe by experience, that one with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfit
hande, that either lacketh a finger, or
a thumbe, or that hath his hand Å¿ore, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e
blemiÅ¿hed, may as well with his lame
hand receiue a good and fine piece of golde
from a riche man, for his almes, as one that
hath a whole or Å¿ounde hande: Å¿o may wee
receyue from ChriÅ¿t, if wee beleeue but a
litle, as much as a grayne of muÅ¿tard Å¿eede
in quantitie, wee may receyue remiÅ¿Å¿ion of
Å¿innes, and all other benefites of his death
and paÅ¿Å¿ion, as well as he that hath a Å¿tron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
faith and a greater. And nothing Å¿hall
be vnpoÅ¿Å¿ible vnto vs, as ChriÅ¿t Å¿ayde to
his diÅ¿ciples in the like matter, Matth. 17.
Nowe <hi>faith is</hi> Å¿ayde to bee <hi>a firme and
a conÅ¿tant aÅ¿Å¿ent of the minde to the
wordes of God, wrought by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the holy ghoÅ¿t for the Å¿aluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the beleeuers.</hi> Seeyng then Å¿o
<pb facs="tcp:10917:160"/>
many excellent thinges are giuen vnto
vs, if wee abide faithfull, and beleeue in
the Lorde: and Å¿eeing furthermore on the
contrary part, wee are depriued of all theÅ¿e
promiÅ¿es and giftes, if we haue no faith: it
behoueth vs to looke about, and to examine
well our Å¿elues, our hearts, our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿ciences,
our inwarde parts and affections, to Å¿ee
whether we be in this faith or no, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vnfainedly perÅ¿uade our Å¿elues
before the Lorde, that wee haue this true
faith in IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t: If we haue it, let vs
continue and abide in it to the end, that we
may be Å¿aued: let vs vÅ¿e the godly meanes
and exerciÅ¿es of ChriÅ¿tianitie, whereby it
may increaÅ¿e and waxe Å¿tronger in vs: let
vs frequent the hearing of Å¿ermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s, and the
worde of God, in reading it alÅ¿o priuatly,
and let vs ioyne prayer to the Lord, for this
excellent gift of faith. LikewiÅ¿e, the Å¿acra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are to be vÅ¿ed, which are an increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing
of this faith vnto vs, but with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
let vs often vÅ¿e them. Finally the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and Å¿ocietie of the godly Å¿hall helpe
much to this matter. For as faith is gotten
by theÅ¿e meanes, Å¿o is it continued in vs,
and is loÅ¿t, if theÅ¿e exerciÅ¿es bee away. If
any feele him Å¿elfe voyde of faith, let him
<pb facs="tcp:10917:161"/>
beÅ¿eeche the Lord IeÅ¿us, the author of faith
and giuer of it, and Å¿ay with the ApoÅ¿tles,
<hi>Lorde increaÅ¿e my faith,</hi> and let him vÅ¿e y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
wayes that I Å¿pake of euen now, for <hi>faith
commeth by hearing of the word of God.</hi>
which when we heare, the holy GhoÅ¿t wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in vs: yea, the holy GhoÅ¿t it Å¿elfe then
commeth into our heartes by hearing the
worde, as it is reported in the Actes, that
<hi>while Peter Å¿pake, the holy GhoÅ¿t fell on
all them that heard the worde. Actes</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>This fayth is our wedding garment, &amp;
without it, wee Å¿hall be excluded and Å¿hut
out from the marriage of the Lambe. It
is the oyle which we muÅ¿t alwayes haue
in our lampes in a readineÅ¿Å¿e, againÅ¿t the
bridegrome come at midnight. As the fire
goeth out for lacke of wood, Å¿o is fayth
extinguiÅ¿hed in vs for lacke of the worde of
God, and earneÅ¿t &amp; hearty prayer, wherby
it is mainteyned. The Iewes were cut off
for their meredulitie. Well we Å¿tand yet by
faith: let vs take heede, leaÅ¿t in thinking
we Å¿tande, we fall. If the true and naturall
oliues were not Å¿pared, how Å¿hal we eÅ¿cape
that are the wilde oliues, if we prouoke the
Lord? TheÅ¿e things although partly they
haue bene touched already, yet they cannot
<pb facs="tcp:10917:161"/>
be Å¿poken of too much, Å¿eeyng they are the
dueties of of all ChriÅ¿tians, &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts
of the Lord. This doctrine of faith in
ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are iuÅ¿tified by it alone,
&amp; by it obtaine remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes without
the works of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, is not priuate to Å¿ome,
but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon to al that do vnfeynedly beleeue
it, whether they be rich or poore, prince or
begger, bond or free, Iew or Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tile, in this
countrey or that, al are one in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us
who is brother to all alike, and there is no
reÅ¿pect of perÅ¿ons with God, <hi>Actes</hi> 10.
which is a father alike to all that call vpon
him in faith and trueth. This, as it is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and comfortable to all, Å¿o is it moÅ¿t
Å¿pecially to all them that are afflicted in
minde, to them whoÅ¿e calling is but baÅ¿e
and abiect in the worlde, to Å¿uch whom the
worlde maketh no account of, briefly to all
that are in pouerty and miÅ¿erie, forÅ¿aken of
the worlde for ChriÅ¿tes Å¿ake. Neyther is
this doctrine new or Å¿trange as the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aries
doe falÅ¿ely Å¿launder it, which Å¿ay it
was neuer heard of before the time of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
It is not Å¿o, this doctrine is as ancient
as the Prophets of God are, &amp; all they are
witneÅ¿Å¿es vnto it, and was in the primitiue
Church taught of the ApoÅ¿tles. For what
<pb facs="tcp:10917:162"/>
els do we Å¿ay, but that we receiue remiÅ¿Å¿ion
of Å¿innes through faith in ChriÅ¿tes name?
And doth not <hi>S. Peter</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Actes</hi> the tenth
chapter Å¿ay the very Å¿ame, and confirmeth
it by the teÅ¿timonies of all the Prophetes?
Marke his wordes wel, for they proue our
purpoÅ¿e, and confirme the three points that
we haue Å¿et downe in this article, firÅ¿t, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we
al are Å¿inners, Å¿eco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ChriÅ¿t doth forgiue
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> freely, &amp; thirdly, y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> by faith it is, we lay
holde on this remiÅ¿Å¿io<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. His words are theÅ¿e,
euery one of them very effectuall: <hi>To him</hi>
(Å¿aith hee) meaning ChriÅ¿t, of whom hee
made that excellent Å¿ermon, going before
vnto the captaine Cornelius, <hi>giue all the
Prophets witneÅ¿Å¿e, that through his name,
all that beleeue in him, Å¿hal receiue remiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion
of Å¿innes.</hi> Peter doeth Å¿hewe that this
doctrine which wee teache, is not newe or
hereticall, but catholike, and Å¿uch as the
Prophetes them Å¿elues all long agoe did
teache, that by fayth in ChriÅ¿t, euery one
that beleeueth, Å¿hall haue pardon of all his
Å¿innes, whether they be committed before
or after baptiÅ¿me, whether they be actuall
or originall, or whether they be in thought
or in worde, or in deede: if wee beleue Å¿ted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faÅ¿tly,
they Å¿hall all bee forgiuen vs for
<pb facs="tcp:10917:162"/>
ChriÅ¿ts Å¿ake. I Å¿peake here nothing of that
great and horrible Å¿inne againÅ¿t the holy
GhoÅ¿t, which is irremiÅ¿Å¿ible: I hope in the
Lorde, wee Å¿hall neuer haue any thing to
doe with it, and therefore I will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
of it, or what it is. Let this bee our
comfort, that wee that haue any feare of
God, any loue to IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t our Å¿weete
Å¿auiour, any reuerence to heare his bleÅ¿Å¿ed
worde and GoÅ¿pell, and to receiue his holy
Å¿acramentes: we (I Å¿aye) that haue any
motion to theÅ¿e thinges, are farre off from
this Å¿inne, and it Å¿hall not come nere our
dwellings. You haue heard nowe (dearely
beloued) what it is we haue to learne and
beare away vpon this article, what is the
meaning of it, what partes of doctrine it
doeth conteine in it. This article, and the
beliefe of it is very comfortable, yea, the
ioyfulleÅ¿t thing of all others in this life, is
to heare of the remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes, and
that of all, when the leaÅ¿t of them is able
to plucke vs downe to hell, and there to
holde vs in chaynes of darkeneÅ¿Å¿e for euer
and euer, without any hope of recouery,
were it not for his mercies in IeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t. The Lorde doeth in deede beÅ¿towe
dayly many good and great bleÅ¿Å¿ings vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10917:163"/>
vs in his mercy, for the which wee ought
continually to thanke him: but this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
of the waÅ¿hing away of all our Å¿innes
in ChriÅ¿tes blood, doeth as farre paÅ¿Å¿e and
excell them all, as either the Diamonde
doeth the Å¿tone in the Å¿treate, or els the
pureÅ¿t and fineÅ¿t golde that may bee, the
filthieÅ¿t droÅ¿Å¿e and durt that can be founde,
Å¿o great a grace is it, in ChriÅ¿t freely to
haue all our Å¿innes wiped out of Gods
remembrance. But nowe let vs giue (as
wee are dieply bounde) moÅ¿t humble and
hearty thankes to God the father, for Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t his Å¿onne into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde,
to take vpon him our Å¿innes, and to beare
them all away in his body, and let vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
thanke this good and bountiful Å¿auiour
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, for vouchÅ¿auing to humble
him Å¿elfe Å¿o farre for our Å¿akes, as to haue
our Å¿innes imputed vnto him, and to bee
layde vpon his backe, and to Å¿uffer the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hment
dewe for them all. And let vs
alÅ¿o pray both night and daye vnto him, to
take them away from vs more and more,
and to kill this raging Å¿inne within vs, by
the Å¿cepter of his holy woorde, and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his mighty Å¿pirite, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding
<pb facs="tcp:10917:163"/>

a tyrant ouer vs, but that we may mortifie
it from time to time, vntill wee come to
that Å¿tate, wherein it Å¿hall bee cleane put
awaye, and altogether deÅ¿troyed, which
will bee when we Å¿hall meete together in
the ioyfull and happy reÅ¿urrection of our
bodyes, whereof we are to Å¿peake in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
following. TheÅ¿e thinges the Lorde

                  <head>The eleuenth article of
our ChriÅ¿tian faith, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth

which is,
The reÅ¿urrection of the body.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the fourth part of this our
ChriÅ¿tian beliefe, which was of
the church, I declared that there
were three conÅ¿equents or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
annexed vnto it. The firÅ¿t you haue
heard, which was the remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes:
Now doth enÅ¿ue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿econd, which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urrection,
or riÅ¿ing againe of our fleÅ¿h and
bodie. And this article doeth folowe in very
good and apt order after the former: for as
by the firÅ¿t Adams Å¿inne and ours, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
became mortall &amp; Å¿ubiect vnto death:
Å¿o hauing remiÅ¿Å¿ion of our Å¿innes by ChriÅ¿t
the Å¿econd Adam, our bodies Å¿hal hereafter
be made immortall, &amp; raiÅ¿ed from death to
an euerlaÅ¿ting &amp; better life the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that, which
we Å¿hould haue had in ParadiÅ¿e, if Adam &amp;
we had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tinued in our Å¿tate of innocency.
This reÅ¿urrection is the repairing and the
renuing againe of the whole man to a
moÅ¿t bleÅ¿Å¿ed and perfite eÅ¿tate of lyfe.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:164"/>
The meaning therefore of this article is
thus much: I that am a ChriÅ¿tian, do moÅ¿t
certainely beleeue, that not only my body,
but the bodyes of all men, that euer haue
bene from the beginning of the world to
the end of it, Å¿hall at the laÅ¿t day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by the power of ChriÅ¿t at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
be rayÅ¿ed vp againe, (being the Å¿ame
in Å¿ubÅ¿tance, but not in qualities) whether
they be rotted in the graue, or burnt in the
flaming fire, or conÅ¿umed of beaÅ¿tes, or
drowned in the Å¿ea, &amp; deuoured of fiÅ¿hes, or
els of birds. And I moreouer beleeue, that
they Å¿halbe ioyned to their Å¿oules inÅ¿epera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
at the which reÅ¿urrection the godly
Å¿hall haue a full ende of all their miÅ¿eries,
and paynes here; with full poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life, and that the wicked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
Å¿hall goe into euerlaÅ¿ting hel fire,
which is prepared for the deuil and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
This is the true Å¿enÅ¿e and meaning
of this article of the reÅ¿urrection. Now let
vs Å¿ee what good leÅ¿Å¿ons may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of it, for our inÅ¿truction, that wee
may the better profite in the way of true
godlineÅ¿Å¿e, and ChriÅ¿tianity. Three things
are to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿idered in this reÅ¿urrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. FirÅ¿t
that according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿criptures, there Å¿hall
<pb facs="tcp:10917:165"/>
one day be a generall reÅ¿urrection of good
and bad. Secondly, to what ende this Å¿hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be.
Thirdly, the conÅ¿olation and comfort,
that wee may reape and inioy by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urrection,
in the applying of it to our owne
conÅ¿ciences. I am not ignorant, howe that
very many thinges muÅ¿t be repeated here,
which haue bene Å¿poken of before, both in
the article of ChriÅ¿tes reÅ¿urrection, which
is a playne confirmation and proofe of this,
and alÅ¿o in the other artice of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ming
agayne to iudgement, which Å¿halbe then
when this article Å¿halbe fully accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed
vnto vs. TheÅ¿e thinges are Å¿o incident
the one to the other, I meane ChriÅ¿tes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,

                     </gap>e Å¿eparated: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
we will by Gods grace Å¿o Å¿peake of
them all, as they Å¿hall tend to godly edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to the great comfort of all them
that do nowe in theÅ¿e laÅ¿t and dangerous
dayes mourne in Zion. And albeit Å¿ome
places and reaÅ¿ons Å¿halbe nowe brought
here, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proofe of this article which haue
ben alleaged before: yet it Å¿hall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿e
to beare them againe and often, that
wee may the better remember them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e
<pb facs="tcp:10917:165"/>
wee are all dull in hearing, and
forgetfull of good thinges, Å¿o fickle is
our memorie. In the Scriptures both
in the Lawe and in the Prophetes, and
alÅ¿o in the newe TeÅ¿tament, yee haue the
Å¿ame leÅ¿Å¿ons giuen foorth often vnto you,
eÅ¿pecially in the PÅ¿almes, where the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of the verÅ¿e, is either but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition,
or els a more playne declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the former part of the Å¿entence.
Yea, Saint Paul him Å¿elfe well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿toode
this to bee a very profitable and
good thing, to heare one leÅ¿Å¿on many
tymes, and therefore Å¿ayde to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,
<hi>It grieueth mee not to wryte
the Å¿ame thinges to you, and for you it
is a Å¿ure thing, chapter</hi> 3. Seeing this is
Å¿o, let vs then come to our purpoÅ¿e, which
is to proue that there Å¿hall bee a generall
reÅ¿urrection of all men. This article is (I
graunt) very harde to bee beleeued, if wee
iudge of it by fleÅ¿h &amp; blood only, as farre as
naturall reaÅ¿on will extende, but where
fayth is planted, there reaÅ¿on hath no
place. And all the woorkes of God, if they
did not paÅ¿Å¿e our reaÅ¿on and capacitie,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:166"/>
then they were there not Å¿o wonderfull,
neither Å¿hould theybe vnÅ¿earcheable or paÅ¿t
finding out, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> the ApoÅ¿tle affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
<hi>Romanes.</hi> 11. Å¿aying, <hi>O the deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e
of the riches, both of the wiÅ¿edome
and knowledge of God!</hi> Many of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Å¿ort of the heathen PhiloÅ¿ophers, as
<hi>Plato, AriÅ¿totle</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> although they
were fully perÅ¿waded of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> immortality of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿oule, yet they neuer did Å¿o much as once
dreame or thinke of the immortalitie, and
reÅ¿urrection of the fleÅ¿he, which we beare
about with vs. So incredible a thing did
it Å¿eeme vnto them. And therefore <hi>Saint
Paul,</hi> when hee came to <hi>Athens,</hi> and there
preached ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us vnto them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other good poyntes of ChriÅ¿tianitye, &amp;
of our fayth, they heard him indifferently
without any mocking at al: but when he
Å¿ayde and affirmed conÅ¿tantly vnto them,
<hi>that God had appoynted a day, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which
he wil iudge the worlde in righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e,
by that man whom hee hath appoynted,
wherof he hath giuen an aÅ¿Å¿urance to all
men, in that he hath rayÅ¿ed him from the
dead, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they mocked, becauÅ¿e they heard
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reÅ¿urrection from the dead, Actes</hi> 17.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:166"/>
Well, notwithÅ¿tanding al this, we that are
ChriÅ¿tians and trayned vp in the Å¿chole of
ChriÅ¿t our maÅ¿ter, muÅ¿t beleeue this point.
For Å¿urely the ful perÅ¿waÅ¿ion of this one
article, comprehendeth many other articles
of our fayth: <hi>For if wee riÅ¿e not agayne,
then is not ChriÅ¿t riÅ¿en: if ChriÅ¿t be not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿en,
then are we in our Å¿innes,</hi> and Å¿o the
former article that went before, falleth to
the ground. But if this be true, then all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
other going before are confirmed, and out
of doubt. Let vs therefore heare, and marke
alÅ¿o Å¿ome infallible teÅ¿timonies, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorityes
of the euerlaÅ¿ting &amp; true word of
God, to builde our fayth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in this Å¿o hard
&amp; Å¿trange a matter to reaÅ¿on, &amp; to confirme
vs againÅ¿t all tentations of Satan, or of
the wicked and carnal AtheiÅ¿ts, which wil
goe about to vndermine the veritie of this
article. We haue in the third chapter of the
booke Exodus, a manifeÅ¿t proofe of the
reÅ¿urrection in theÅ¿e woordes, where as
God Å¿peaking to MoÅ¿es, Å¿ayeth on this
wiÅ¿e, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, the God
of IÅ¿ahac, and the God of Iacob.</hi> Which
woordes are Å¿o forcible, that our Å¿auiour
ChriÅ¿t vÅ¿ed no other argument agaynÅ¿t the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:167"/>
                     <hi>Sadduces</hi> which denied this reÅ¿urrection.
For God cannot be Å¿ayde to be God of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
except he raiÅ¿e him againe, and the
bodye be ioyned to the Å¿oule. For he calleth
not himÅ¿elfe, the God of Abrahams Å¿oule,
but of Abraham, meaning the whole man.
It was euident therefore that Abraham
with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reÅ¿t of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers, Å¿hal riÅ¿e againe. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
excellent is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of Iob, in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
chapter of his booke. <hi>I knowe</hi>
(Å¿ayeth he) <hi>that my redeemer liueth, and
he Å¿hal Å¿tand the laÅ¿t on the earth, and
though after this skinne wormes Å¿hall
deuoure this body, yet Å¿hall I Å¿ee God in
my fleÅ¿h, whom I my Å¿elfe Å¿hall Å¿ee, &amp; my
eyes Å¿hall behold, and none other for me,
though my reines are conÅ¿umed with
in me.</hi> We Å¿ee by this, that Iob long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs, or before the newe TeÅ¿tament
was written, had a full hope of the reÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
that both body and Å¿oule Å¿hould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
the preÅ¿ence of God at the laÅ¿t day.
this is written (as Paul Å¿ayeth) for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truction,
that wee Å¿houlde haue the like
hope and aÅ¿Å¿urance as hee had, in the
happie and bleÅ¿Å¿ed reÅ¿urrection of our
bodyes after death. This truÅ¿t and fayth
had the Prophet Dauid, in the Å¿ixteenth
<pb facs="tcp:10917:167"/>
pÅ¿alme, <hi>Thou Å¿halt not leaue my body
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graue, neither Å¿halt thou Å¿uffer thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one to Å¿ee corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.</hi> In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿ix and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
of EÅ¿ay we read thus, <hi>Thy dead men
Å¿hall liue, euen with my body Å¿hall they
riÅ¿e. Awake, and Å¿ing yee that dwell in
duÅ¿t, for thy dewe is as the dewe of
herbes, &amp; the earth Å¿hal caÅ¿t out the dead.</hi>
What can be Å¿poken more playnly for
this purpoÅ¿e. LikewiÅ¿e vnder the viÅ¿ion of
the dry bones, which reuiued and tooke
fleÅ¿he, the Lord would Å¿hewe vnto Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
that he was able to doe all thinges, and
to bring the people out of captiuitye, which
were as dry bones then rotten and conÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
And this was a type of the reÅ¿urrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
to the houÅ¿e of IÅ¿rael in their baniÅ¿hment,
being reÅ¿tored to their countrey agayne.
That place of Daniel in the twelft of his
propheÅ¿ie is moÅ¿t euident, <hi>At that tyme,
Å¿hal Michael Å¿tand vp, the great prince,
which Å¿ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>deth for the children of thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and there Å¿halbe a time of trouble,
Å¿uch as neuer was Å¿ince there began
to be a nation vnto that Å¿ame time, and at
that time thy people Å¿halbe deliuered, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one that Å¿halbe written in the booke<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
and many of them that Å¿leepe in the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:168"/>
duÅ¿t of the earth, Å¿hall awake, Å¿ome to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaÅ¿ting
life, and Å¿ome to perpetuall
Å¿hame and contempt. And they that be
wiÅ¿e, Å¿hall Å¿hine as the brightneÅ¿Å¿e of the
firmament: and they that turne many to
righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿hall Å¿hine as the Å¿tarres for
euer and euer.</hi> Here is Å¿et foorth the riÅ¿ing
of all men, both good and bad, &amp; the glorie
of the one Å¿ort, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿hame and confuÅ¿io<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of
the other. Looke <hi>Matthew 22. Marke 12.
Luke</hi> 20. Our Å¿auiour ChriÅ¿t exhorting
rich men to make feaÅ¿tes, and to prouide for
the poore, Å¿ayde, <hi>that they Å¿hould be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿ed
in the reÅ¿urrection of the iuÅ¿t, Luk.</hi>
14. Where we may note, that the reÅ¿urrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is Å¿ayde to be a recompence and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
for the iuÅ¿t. And Å¿urely Å¿o it is: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord might Å¿eeme to be vniuÅ¿t,
which many times doeth not here reward
the Godly, as he hath promiÅ¿ed, nor puniÅ¿h
the vniuÅ¿t, as he hath threatned them. And
<hi>if we truÅ¿t in ChriÅ¿t only in this life, we are</hi>
(Å¿ayth Paul) <hi>of all men moÅ¿t miÅ¿erable.</hi>
We hope therefore for another life, and
this is in the reÅ¿urrection: this is our ioy &amp;
comfort. I Å¿ee then no cauÅ¿e why me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Å¿hould
be Å¿o Å¿ory to dye, and depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> this world,
Å¿eeing a better world is kept in Å¿tore for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:168"/>
I come to the newe TeÅ¿tament. In the 6
of Iohn our Sauiour hath a notable place
to confirme this matter vnto vs. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
in that place Å¿peaketh of both the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urrections,
the one from Å¿inne in this life,
in the 25. verÅ¿e, <hi>that the dead Å¿hould heare
his voyce,</hi> that is, they that were in minde
and fayth dead, Å¿hould nowe heare his GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and be renewed vnto repentance, and Å¿o
liue a newe life. This Å¿eemed a Å¿trange doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
to the Iewes, and they wondered all
at it. Our Sauiour then goeth farther with
them, &amp; telleth them of more Å¿trange things
then theÅ¿e, Å¿aying, <hi>Maruell not at this: for
the houre Å¿hall come, in the which all that
are in the graues, Å¿hall heare his voyce, and
they Å¿hall come foorth, that haue done
good, vnto the reÅ¿urrection of life, and they
that haue done ill, vnto the reÅ¿urrection of
condemnation.</hi> Martha a woman was wel
perÅ¿waded of this article, for Å¿he did beleeue
that her brother <hi>Lazarus Å¿houlde be rayÅ¿ed
vp at the laÅ¿t day, Iohn</hi> 11. Againe, if all
nations Å¿hall bee gathered together before
ChriÅ¿t, then all Å¿hall riÅ¿e, that they may bee
iudged: otherwiÅ¿e he can not be Å¿ayde to be
the iudge of quicke and dead. Neyther doth
the remayning of Å¿ome aliue till the latter
<pb facs="tcp:10917:169"/>
day hinder this poÅ¿ition, but that all Å¿hall
riÅ¿e. For they that dyd neuer die, Å¿hall bee
rayÅ¿ed vp with newe bodies, which change
Å¿hall be as the ryÅ¿ing from the dead, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
weake and corruptible bodies, they
Å¿halbe glorified and made heauenly bodies.
If we conÅ¿ider the power of God whereby
he is able to do all things, euen what he liÅ¿t,
and greater thinges then wee can imagine:
then this will not Å¿eeme hard or abÅ¿urde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs. We doe beleeue and confeÅ¿Å¿e, that he
is almightie in the firÅ¿t article, and therfore
we muÅ¿t needes confeÅ¿Å¿e that hee can doe it,
as eaÅ¿ily as he rayÅ¿ed vp the bodie of ChriÅ¿t,
wherein he hath giuen the aÅ¿Å¿urance of the
whole Church. And he that made al things
of nothing at the firÅ¿t by his onely worde, is
able alÅ¿o nowe to bring to paÅ¿Å¿e that of duÅ¿t
and earth Å¿hall bodies be rayÅ¿ed vp againe.
Saint Paul coulde not bee brought from
this perÅ¿waÅ¿ion by any meanes, eyther by
feare or diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure of the Sadduces, or of
Agrippa: or FeÅ¿tus, but he proteÅ¿ted, that
<hi>he had hope towarde God, that the reÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the dead, which dyd Å¿eeme an
incredible thing vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, Act. 26. Å¿houlde
bee both of iuÅ¿t and vniuÅ¿t, Act.</hi> 24. The
hope of this reÅ¿urrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> made Saint Paul,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:169"/>
as it Å¿houlde doe vs, to do his duetie round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
for herein (Å¿aieth he) <hi>I endeuour my
Å¿elfe to haue alwayes a cleare conÅ¿cience
towarde God, and toward men.</hi> For vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for this cauÅ¿e doe many men make Å¿hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke
of fayth and conÅ¿cience in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and affayres of this life, becauÅ¿e they
haue quite forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> this day of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reÅ¿urrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherein an account muÅ¿t be giuen, not
onely of wicked deedes and blaÅ¿phemous
wordes, <hi>but of euery idle worde Å¿poken,
as our Sauiour Å¿ayeth, Matth.</hi> 12. If wee
woulde conÅ¿ider this, howe wee muÅ¿t all
Å¿tande naked before the hie tribunall Å¿eate
of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, it woulde Å¿urely make vs
to tremble &amp; to quake euery veine and ioynt
in vs, when we thinke vpon it. The day Å¿hal
be fearefull and terrible, I hope there is no
man among vs that doubteth of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of this day, although the day and houre
it Å¿elfe be knowen to no man. And this is to
make vs alwayes to be in a readineÅ¿Å¿e for it.
<hi>For it Å¿hal come vpon a Å¿udden, 1. TheÅ¿.</hi> 5.
I Å¿hould be long and ouer tedious, and not
Å¿eeme to write a Lecture to exhort &amp; teach,
but rather a treatiÅ¿e to conuince the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿arie
and wicked, if I Å¿houlde recken vp all
the places that here myght be brought for
<pb facs="tcp:10917:170"/>
the confirmation of this doctrine. Let theÅ¿e
therefore for this time Å¿uffice: and if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
reader be diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to Å¿ee moe, let him
reade the 15. Chapter of the firÅ¿t EpiÅ¿tle to
the Corinthians, there he Å¿hall haue a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diÅ¿courÅ¿e &amp; handling of this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Å¿et purpoÅ¿e, Paul prouing the reÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
by many reaÅ¿ons, both diuine and
humane, and Å¿hewing moreouer with what
qualities, conditions and properties the
bodies of the faythfull Å¿hall be rayÅ¿ed vp:
where he alÅ¿o anÅ¿wereth the obiections that
may bee made to the contrary. I conclude
this part with the wordes of Saint Paul to
the Philippians the thirde Chapter: <hi>Let
our conuerÅ¿ation be in heauen, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> whence
we looke for the Å¿auiour, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us
ChriÅ¿t, who Å¿hall change our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
that it may be faÅ¿hioned like vnto his
glorious body, according to the working
whereby he is able eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to Å¿ubdue al things
vnto him Å¿elfe.</hi> In theÅ¿e words he Å¿heweth
that Gods power is able to doe this, and
although our bodies bee vile, they Å¿hall bee
made fayre againe: trees Å¿eeme to be dead
and rotten in the winter, which in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿pring
time come forth moÅ¿t floriÅ¿hingly with their
fruite in due Å¿eaÅ¿on: Å¿o it is in the reÅ¿urrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:170"/>
This made the fathers Å¿o carefully to
burie the dead with their balmes &amp; odours,
knowing they Å¿hould appeare againe. LaÅ¿t
of all, I referre you to the 2. Pet. 7. Chap.
&amp; Reue. 20. where this reÅ¿urrection is moÅ¿t
liuely, as in a table before your eyes, deÅ¿cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
It followeth in the Å¿econd place, to Å¿ee
to what ende this great reÅ¿urrection Å¿hall
be. We haue Å¿eene the efficient and chiefe
cauÅ¿ of this reÅ¿urrection, to be the power
of God mightily woorking in him Å¿elfe.
The fourme of it is, the ioyning and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
together of the body &amp; Å¿oule for euer:
and the matter wherein this doeth Å¿tande, is
the Å¿oule and body of man, which muÅ¿t bee
repayred againe, being once corrupted by
Å¿inne in our firÅ¿t grandfather Adam, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o
in vs his children, Å¿pringing of the Å¿ame
corrupt roote with him. The finall cauÅ¿e
why this reÅ¿urrection Å¿hall bee, is of two
Å¿ortes: the one is in the reÅ¿pect of the good
and godly men, who haue liued here in
the feare of the Lord, to his honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
in theÅ¿e he will Å¿hewe his exceeding
great mercie, in making them veÅ¿Å¿els of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to Å¿erue him, whome he will rewarde
with euerlaÅ¿ting life, which yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding
they haue not of duetie deÅ¿erued,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:171"/>
(as the PapiÅ¿ts Å¿ay) but in mercie doeth the
Lorde beÅ¿towe it vpon them. The other
cauÅ¿e is in reÅ¿pect of the wicked and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
vpon whom the Lorde will Å¿hewe his
perfite iuÅ¿tice againÅ¿t Å¿inne and wickednes,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mitted of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> without repentance. TheÅ¿e
will hee make veÅ¿Å¿els of his wrath, which
Å¿hal burne in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> with an vnquenchable fire,
without ende and mercie, who becauÅ¿e here
they haue not bene throughly puniÅ¿hed, or
Å¿ometimes not at all, therefore the full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure
of their puniÅ¿hment is reÅ¿erued til that
great day, then to be powred out vpon them
in fire and brimÅ¿tone, in that burning lake
continually which neuer Å¿hall haue ende.
For theÅ¿e cauÅ¿es is this reÅ¿urrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
wee Å¿peake) ordayned. To Å¿peake of the
end for the godly, firÅ¿t, Å¿o it is that the Lord
hath promiÅ¿ed in mercie to reward all his
faythfull Å¿eruants, which commeth not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
times to paÅ¿Å¿e in this life, therefore there
remaineth a life to come to be Å¿hewed in the
reÅ¿urrection of the fleÅ¿h. And if all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e
bee Å¿ure to bee recompenÅ¿ed with a
promiÅ¿e of a good turne in the life to come
(as Paul declareth to Timothie the firÅ¿t
EpiÅ¿tle and fourth Chapter) Then out of
all doubt very expedient and neceÅ¿Å¿arie it
<pb facs="tcp:10917:171"/>
is, that there Å¿houlde be a reÅ¿urrection. If
any man Å¿ay. The Å¿oules of the faythfull are
rewarded as Å¿oone as they depart from the
bodie, with this promiÅ¿e of life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they Å¿eeme not to lacke a rewarde, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there be no reÅ¿urrection, and Å¿o
God is true of his promiÅ¿e: I anÅ¿were, that
as the bodyes of the faythfull while they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
well here, haue bene temples of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
GhoÅ¿t, to Å¿erue the Lord withall, and as
not onely in Å¿oule, but alÅ¿o in body through
diuers tentations and perÅ¿ecutions they
haue bene afflicted for ChriÅ¿t, and haue
Å¿till bene vnder the croÅ¿Å¿e: Å¿o Å¿urely, they
alÅ¿o with the Å¿oule Å¿hall be glorified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
according to the things that they
haue done. And to this agree the wordes of
the holy ApoÅ¿tle: <hi>We muÅ¿t all</hi> (Å¿ayeth he)
<hi>appeare before the iudgement Å¿eate of
ChriÅ¿t, that euery man may receyue the
things which are done in his body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that he hath done, whether it bee
good or euill, 2. Corin.</hi> 5. Here he nameth
expreÅ¿ly the body, otherwiÅ¿e the rewarde
were vnperfite, if in one part onely it were
beÅ¿towed. The Lord will not Å¿uffer the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of a cuppe of colde water to his Å¿aints
to goe vnrewarded, much more therefore
<pb facs="tcp:10917:172"/>
will he rewarde thoÅ¿e that haue giuen their
bodies to be conÅ¿umed in the flames of fire
for his cauÅ¿e and the GoÅ¿pel: Å¿o that if any
loÅ¿e his life for his Å¿ake in this worlde, he
Å¿hall finde it in the worlde to come, with an
hundred fold more, with all happineÅ¿Å¿e and
ioy reÅ¿tored vnto him. If we looke vpon all
the Å¿aints that haue bene from time to time,
we Å¿hall Å¿ee that they had no felicitie, nor
happineÅ¿Å¿e in this life. The EpiÅ¿tle to the
Hebrewes, Å¿peaking of the excellent fayth
of the olde Patriarkes and ancient fathers,
Å¿heweth vs what was their eÅ¿tate in this
life, for their good woorkes and deedes:
<hi>Some were racked and woulde not bee
deliuered, others were tryed by moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
and Å¿courginges, by bandes and
impriÅ¿onment, they were Å¿toned, they
were hewen aÅ¿under, they were tempted,
they were Å¿layne with the Å¿worde, they
wandered vp &amp; downe in goates skinnes,
and Å¿heepes skinnes, being deÅ¿titute, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
and tormented, wandring in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneÅ¿Å¿es,
and mountaynes, and dennes
and caues of the earth.</hi> If we aÅ¿ke the end,
why they Å¿uffered and endured Å¿uch things
of the wicked, the Å¿ame ApoÅ¿tle doeth make
vs anÅ¿were, <hi>This they did, that they might
<pb facs="tcp:10917:172"/>
receiue a better reÅ¿urrection.</hi> And Å¿urely
they had bene fooles to endure Å¿uch torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts
of body, if the body and Å¿oule had periÅ¿hed
in their death and graue, as doe the bodies
of bruite beaÅ¿tes, without any hope of the
reÅ¿urrection. ConÅ¿ider ye the ApoÅ¿tles, how
they were rewarded here for their preaching
and godly life: did they not all for the moÅ¿t
part, in the ende Å¿uffer death and martyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
for their labour? howe was Paul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
of the Lorde in this life? did hee not
whippe and Å¿courge him when hee receiued
him for his Å¿onne? yes truely. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿eth
what his whole life was after his
conuerÅ¿ion: nothing but a Å¿ea of troubles
&amp; miÅ¿eries, fightings without, and terrours
within, hunger and thirÅ¿t, colde, nakedneÅ¿Å¿e,
bandes and pouertie were the rewardes
that the Lorde gaue him here, inÅ¿omuch,
that hee might Å¿eeme to be in worÅ¿e caÅ¿e af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his conuerÅ¿ion to ChriÅ¿t, then before, if
hee had iudged of his afflictions by a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and carnal eye, and not according to faith,
as did carnall Demas, and therefore becauÅ¿e
hee felt miÅ¿eries in this life, in ChriÅ¿tianitie
reuolted from Paul, and embraced this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent
euill worlde, 2. Timothie 4. TheÅ¿e
things made Paul to Å¿ay, <hi>that vnleÅ¿Å¿e there
<pb facs="tcp:10917:173"/>
were a reÅ¿urrection, his Å¿tate had bene moÅ¿t
miÅ¿erable of al others, for what</hi> (Å¿aith hee)
<hi>aduantageth it me to Å¿uffer theÅ¿e things, if
the dead riÅ¿e not agayne, then let vs eate
and drinke, and liue in pleaÅ¿ure.</hi> So we Å¿ee
the hope of the reÅ¿urrection Å¿tayed him from
running into condemnation with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
&amp; he confeÅ¿Å¿ed els where, that his crown
was not here in this life, but was layde vp
for him. And al theÅ¿e vexations of the bodies,
of Å¿oules, of mindes and conÅ¿ciences of men,
is to teach them that no bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e is to bee
hoped for in this our vale of miÅ¿erie: but
we looke for a citie to come, whoÅ¿e builder
and maker is God, Å¿eeing wee haue none
here that is permanent. Our Å¿auiour, when
he comforted his diÅ¿ciples agaynÅ¿t perÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
to come, when as they Å¿houlde bee
mocked, reuiled, taunted, yea and killed for
his Å¿ake, willed them in that day to be glad
and to reioyce, for their rewarde was great
in heauen. Hee Å¿aid not in earth, that their
mindes might be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> this life to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
euerlaÅ¿ting reÅ¿t out of this world. And this
can not be, but in the reÅ¿urrection of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
They y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will haue their reward in this
life, in Å¿hort &amp; tranÅ¿itorie pleaÅ¿ures of Å¿inne
for a Å¿eaÅ¿on, feaÅ¿ting &amp; Å¿porting them Å¿elues
<pb facs="tcp:10917:173"/>
in their wantonnes &amp; vngodly delites, &amp; are
impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t to looke &amp; wait for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauenly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e
of ioyes, that Å¿hal haue no ende, are
like vnto the rich man both proude and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonous,
that fared deliciouÅ¿ly euery day, and
went in purple and Å¿ilke, not regarding the
poore eÅ¿tate of Lazarus, and therefore nowe
in hel receiueth paine &amp; puniÅ¿hment endles,
which in his life time receiued pleaÅ¿ure &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
But they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce, &amp; quiet minds
can take al things in good worth, whether it
be Å¿icknes or pouertie, or Å¿hame &amp; ignominie,
which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord here Å¿endeth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in this life,
for a trial of their faith, &amp; can looke vp vnto y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi>
celeÅ¿tial life to come, tarying the Lords lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure,
theÅ¿e men are like to poore Lazarus,
which in deed in his life time receiued paine,
but is now comforted beyond all ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an euerlaÅ¿ting comfort, Luke 16.
Dauid pronounceth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

Lord,</hi> &amp; yet if we reÅ¿pect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preÅ¿e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t time, it doth
not Å¿o appeare to vs, but rather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary:
for what bleÅ¿Å¿ednes is here, either in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body,
or in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿oule, if we Å¿peake of a Å¿ounde &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
happines, as he mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t it? The Å¿oule is infec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Å¿inne, the vnderÅ¿tanding is darkned, &amp;
the things we know not are moe in number,
then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things we know: Å¿o y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our knowledge
<pb facs="tcp:10917:174"/>
which Å¿hould beautifie and adorne out Å¿oule,
is vnperfect: and this not onely in thinges
naturall and ciuill, but alÅ¿o in heauenly my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teries,
and matters of greateÅ¿t waight &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance:
Å¿o that Paul might well crye out
and Å¿ay, <hi>O mortall man that I am, who
Å¿hall deliuer mee from the body of this
death.</hi> Rom. 7. No happineÅ¿Å¿e therefore in
this life of the minde of man, but that which
is, is rather a Å¿hadowe and a viÅ¿our, then
any true Å¿ight of happineÅ¿Å¿e. <hi>For it doeth
not yet appeare what we Å¿hal be, although
nowe we are the Å¿onnes of God: but this
Å¿hall appeare when ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall come in
glory,</hi> ColoÅ¿. 3. Now if any griefe of mind
which is inwarde, come to the Å¿oule, then it
Å¿eemeth to bee in hell, and this dolour Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth
all the paÅ¿Å¿ions and paynes of
the body. Let any man conÅ¿ider the bodie,
and he will Å¿ay that it can not bee happie in
this life: the diÅ¿eaÅ¿es and Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿es of it
are Å¿o many in number, that they haue paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed
the arte and Å¿kil of the beÅ¿t PhyÅ¿itions to
heale them. And if the diÅ¿eaÅ¿es of the body
were away, yet were there calamities a
thouÅ¿and to proue it to be in a very wretched
caÅ¿e, as longe as it is Å¿ubiect to Å¿inne in
this pylgrimage. What croÅ¿Å¿es are Å¿hame
<pb facs="tcp:10917:174"/>
to vs, &amp; ignominie, contempt and reproche,
which cauÅ¿e many moÅ¿t deÅ¿perately to hang
themÅ¿elues? What is pouertie with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
as lacke of friendes, meate and drinke,
want of apparell which is neceÅ¿Å¿arie, lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and houÅ¿e roome, with Å¿uch thinges?
TheÅ¿e miÅ¿eries a man may haue, although
hee had health of body, although yet theÅ¿e
thinges bring Å¿ickenes with them common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
What then are other externall dangers,
as the wounding and hurting of our Å¿elues,
the Å¿poyling of our goods, dangers vpon
the land of theeues, &amp; vpon the Å¿ea of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
and if we Å¿cape that, there is danger of
vngodly Pirates. TheÅ¿e croÅ¿Å¿es being
layde together, and weyed in the balance of
iuÅ¿tice, wil cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>terpeiÅ¿e &amp; ouerweigh al our
pleaÅ¿ures that are, or may bee inuented in
this life: Å¿o great is the heape of miÅ¿eries in
this life. And theÅ¿e troubles that I haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
rehearÅ¿ed, as they are common to all,
Å¿o eÅ¿pecially to the godly, to make them not
to bee in loue with this worlde, Å¿eeing the
Lorde hath reÅ¿erued the bleÅ¿Å¿ed reÅ¿urrection
for them. Wherefore (dearly beloued) call
now to remembrance the dayes that are paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed,
and conÅ¿ider the Å¿ayntes, which after
they had receiued light, endured a great
<pb facs="tcp:10917:175"/>
fight in afflictions, as our martyrs did in
Q. Maries dayes, partly while they were
made a gazing Å¿tocke, both by reproches &amp;
afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s being toÅ¿Å¿ed to &amp; fro, &amp; Å¿uffered w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
ioy the Å¿poyling of their goods. And knowe
you deare brethren, that ye haue in heauen a
better and a more induring Å¿ubÅ¿tance then al
the golde &amp; Å¿iluer of princes. CaÅ¿t not away
therefore your confidence which hath great
recompence of reward in this day of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
of your bodies. For ye haue neede
of patience, that after ye haue done the will
of the Lorde, yee may receiue the promiÅ¿e of
eternall life. For yet a very litle while, and
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t the authour of this reÅ¿urrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Å¿hall come, will come, and will not
tary. Thus much for the ende of this reÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in reÅ¿pect of the Å¿eruantes of ChriÅ¿t,
which then, and not before Å¿hall fully be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
and made perfitely bleÅ¿Å¿ed in euery
part, both body and Å¿oule, wherein they haue
Å¿erued their Lorde faythfully, when they
were aliue. Nowe let vs Å¿ee the ende, for
the which all the wicked Å¿hall riÅ¿e againe
at that day, which alÅ¿o Å¿tandeth with the
iuÅ¿tice of the Lorde, to recompence them
after their demerites. As not onely the
Å¿oules of the wicked haue offended their
<pb facs="tcp:10917:175"/>
GOD by their Å¿innefull thoughtes and
cogitations, but alÅ¿o their bodyes haue
bene Å¿laues vnto Å¿inne, and haue giuen
their members ouer to Å¿erue vnrighteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e:
Å¿o it Å¿tandeth with equitie, that not
onely their mindes and conÅ¿ciences be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
but alÅ¿o their bodyes, by the which
they here haue wrought all theÅ¿e abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Å¿hould feele the rewarde &amp; Å¿tipende of
Å¿inne, which is the euerlaÅ¿ting death, euen
the Å¿econde death of the Å¿oule and body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
This puniÅ¿hment is deferred moÅ¿t
commonly in this life, and who in Å¿o good
eÅ¿tate, as concerning the bodie here, as the
wicked and Å¿uch as contemne the Lorde:
In Å¿o much that their proÅ¿peritie &amp; wealth,
haue moued the godly to wonder at the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
iudgements of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord in this their caÅ¿e.
This thing mooued the Prophete Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk
to crye vnto the Lorde for vengeance
agaynÅ¿t the wicked, being troubled with
their proÅ¿peritie and Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e. <hi>Wherefore
doeÅ¿t thou looke</hi> (Å¿ayth hee) <hi>vpon the
tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ours, and holdeÅ¿t thy tongue,
when the wicked deuoureth the man that
is more righteous then hee, whereof they
reioyce and are glad.</hi> Habakkuk 1.
This complaynt likewiÅ¿e made the prophet
<pb facs="tcp:10917:176"/>
Ieremie in his time, in the 12. of his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
Å¿aying, <hi>O Lord, if I diÅ¿pute with thee,
thou art righteous, yet let mee talke with
thee of thy iudgementes: wherefore doeth
the way of the vngodly proÅ¿per? why are
they in wealth, that rebelliouÅ¿ly tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿greÅ¿Å¿e?</hi>
TheÅ¿e were Ieremies words co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cerning the
ill men: but he addeth more, Thou haÅ¿t plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, and they haue taken roote, they
growe and bring foorth fruite: thou art
neere in their mouth, and farre from their
reynes. Dauid founde by experience the
like Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e of the wicked in his dayes alÅ¿o,
and therefore Å¿aith that hee fretted at the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h,
when hee Å¿awe the proÅ¿peritie of the
wicked: <hi>For</hi> (Å¿aith hee) <hi>there are no bandes
in their death, but they are luÅ¿ty &amp; Å¿trong:
they are not in trouble as other men, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are they plagued with other men.
Therefore pride is as a chaine vnto them,
and cruelty couereth them as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
their eyes Å¿tand out for fatneÅ¿Å¿e: they
haue more then heart can wiÅ¿he: they are
licentious, &amp; Å¿peake wickedly of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ion:
they talke preÅ¿umptuouÅ¿ly: they
Å¿et their mouth againÅ¿t heauen, and their
tongue walketh through the earth.</hi> Here
you haue a deÅ¿cription of their life, and of
<pb facs="tcp:10917:176"/>
their proÅ¿peritie, what the one is, &amp; what
the other is alÅ¿o, their life is licentious, and
yet it goeth well with them for theÅ¿e tranÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
goods: but what doth Dauid confeÅ¿Å¿e
of him Å¿elfe, which was the childe of God?
<hi>Daily</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>haue I bene puniÅ¿hed and
chaÅ¿tened euery morning, PÅ¿al.</hi> 73. Seeing
this Å¿tandeth Å¿o with the wicked, Å¿hall wee
not Å¿ay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they Å¿halbe puniÅ¿hed elÅ¿ewhere?
Yes no doubt, there is a iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t day kept
in Å¿tore for them, where they Å¿hall be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed,
although they haue liued in pleaÅ¿ure
here: otherwiÅ¿e the Lorde Å¿hould not bee
iuÅ¿t. Looke vpon the 21. chap. of <hi>Iob,</hi> and
you Å¿hall Å¿ee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> long before Dauid, he tooke
vp the like complaint, then, when he Å¿awe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
wealth &amp; eaÅ¿e in this life of the godleÅ¿Å¿e, &amp;
contemners of religion. We Å¿ee howe the
Iewes, the children of God were Å¿til afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of their enemies, &amp; kept vnder the rod,
when as their perÅ¿ecutors, the <hi>AÅ¿Å¿yrians,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi>
                     <hi>Caldeans,</hi> the <hi>PerÅ¿ians,</hi> the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the
<hi>Romanes,</hi> with the reÅ¿t, liued in al wealth,
peace and worldly proÅ¿peritie. It remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
therfore, that they one day Å¿hould feele
the rewarde of Å¿inne in their bodies which
haue Å¿inned: the which thing Å¿eldome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to effect in this preÅ¿ent Å¿tate of life.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:177"/>
The Lord hath Å¿aid by <hi>EÅ¿aie</hi> his Prophet in
the 65. chap. <hi>Behold, my Å¿eruants Å¿hal eate,
and ye Å¿hal be hungry: behold, my Å¿erua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts
Å¿hall drinke, and ye Å¿halbe thirÅ¿ty: behold,
my Å¿eruants Å¿hal reioyce, and ye Å¿halbe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hamed:
behold, my Å¿eruants Å¿hal Å¿ing for
ioy of heart, and ye Å¿hall crie for Å¿orow of
heart, and Å¿hal houle for vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of minde.</hi>
Although this be Å¿omewhat accompliÅ¿hed,
euen here vnder the kingdome of grace,
wherby the godly do reioyce, &amp; the wicked
are Å¿omewhat quailed: yet Å¿hall it eÅ¿pecially
be Å¿eene in the kingdome of glory, when the
elect Å¿halbe fully Å¿et in Å¿ure poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of all
ioyes, and the wicked haue full meaÅ¿ure of
all their deÅ¿erued puniÅ¿hments. To end the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
this matter, the vÅ¿e of this doctrine is this:
Å¿eeing the wicked Å¿halbe rewarded Å¿euen
fold into their boÅ¿ome, and Å¿hall make and
giue an account very Å¿trait of all their
life wickedly &amp; vngraciouÅ¿ly Å¿pent vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
earth: let not vs freat at them before the
time, as Dauid counÅ¿elleth vs, neither let
vs enuy their hie &amp; Å¿o proÅ¿perous eÅ¿tate, <hi>for
they Å¿hall Å¿oone be cut down like graÅ¿Å¿e, &amp;
Å¿hall wither as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greene herbe.</hi> Lo, Å¿ee their
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tinuance, &amp; to what thing it is likened of
the holy GhoÅ¿t, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 37. The third thing in
<pb facs="tcp:10917:177"/>
this reÅ¿urrection, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comfort that thereby
doth enÅ¿ue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly, when they thinke &amp;
meditate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> it, which Å¿urely is very great.
For they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are wel perÅ¿waded in minde of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

are moÅ¿t liuely Å¿et forth in the Å¿econd
of WiÅ¿dom, which chapter I would great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wiÅ¿he to be read of all men. Againe, the
Å¿ure beliefe of this doth comfort vs, when
we haue here loÅ¿t our deare friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
becauÅ¿e one day we Å¿hal inioye
their company againe. So did Paul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the <hi>TheÅ¿Å¿alonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>they Å¿hould not be
fory for them that were dead, as thoÅ¿e that
haue no hope,</hi> that they Å¿hal Å¿ee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> againe:
as the heathens did, who lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ted out of al
meaÅ¿ure for their frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ds, as in deede hauing
<pb facs="tcp:10917:178"/>
no hope at al of the reÅ¿urrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, as we Å¿ee it
came to paÅ¿Å¿e in <hi>Cicero,</hi> who could not be
comforted for the death of his daughter
<hi>Tulliola,</hi> whom he loued Å¿o well, although
his friend <hi>Seruius</hi> wrote moÅ¿t comfortably
vnto him. The cogitation hereof doeth
arme vs againÅ¿t all perÅ¿ecutions, to Å¿uffer
all thinges with a quiet and ioyfull mynde,
as the martyrs did endure all kindes of
tormentes in their bodies, becauÅ¿e they
knewe their bodies Å¿hould bee after a more
excellent and glorious Å¿ort, reÅ¿tored to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
againe in an other life. Furthermore, this
will cauÅ¿e vs to abÅ¿taine from all vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
pleaÅ¿ures of the fleÅ¿h and of Å¿inne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idering
we Å¿hall haue pleaÅ¿ures in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urrection
without ende, and that wee Å¿hall
reape there ioy without wearines, if wee
faint not here. With this reÅ¿urrection did
<hi>Iob</hi> comfort him Å¿elfe in his greateÅ¿t extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
Å¿aying, <hi>I knowe that my redeemer
liueth, and that I Å¿hall Å¿ee him in my fleÅ¿h,
Iob</hi> 19. This was the comfort of Paul in
all his perÅ¿ecutions that hee Å¿uffered for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
GoÅ¿pel of ChriÅ¿t, that the dead Å¿hould riÅ¿e
againe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good to glorie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked to Å¿hame
and reproche, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Our Å¿auiour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
rich men in this lyfe, to <hi>giue almes
<pb facs="tcp:10917:178"/>
to the poore, becauÅ¿e they Å¿hould be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿ed
in the reÅ¿urrection of the iuÅ¿t, Luk.
14. EÅ¿ay</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>forteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> afflicted church in his
time with hope of the reÅ¿urrection, Å¿aying,
<hi>Thy dead Å¿hal riÅ¿e, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> with my body Å¿hal
they riÅ¿e, EÅ¿aie</hi> 26. And what is els the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the godly at this day in Å¿uch Å¿orow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
times, and dangerous dayes of Å¿inne,
but onely the Å¿ure hope of this bleÅ¿Å¿ed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.
This is a comfort to euery god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man, when he thinketh vpon it. For this
day is called <hi>the reÅ¿toring of all things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to their former perfection, Act.</hi> 3. It
would greatly reioyce the lame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> or cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to heare that all his limmes Å¿hould bee
reÅ¿tored againe perfectly as they were at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
firÅ¿t. LikewiÅ¿e, it would make glad y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart
of the naked, to heare that he Å¿hould be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with moÅ¿t pretious garments of Å¿ilke
and gold. And why then Å¿hould not we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
ten thouÅ¿and times more, to heare
that we Å¿hall be reÅ¿tored to all integritie of
body and Å¿oule, and clothed with moÅ¿t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
and pure innocency of life for euer and
euer? For our comfort, this day is likened
to the pleaÅ¿ant time of harueÅ¿t, wherein the
godly Å¿hall be gathered into the barne of
ChriÅ¿t as pure wheat, and the wicked caÅ¿t
<pb facs="tcp:10917:179"/>
out into the fire, as the vnprofitable chaffe
good for nothing, Matth. 13. So that they
which Å¿owe here in teares, Å¿hall there reape
in ioy. This day is alÅ¿o termed by ChriÅ¿t &amp;
Paul, the day of the redemption of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
from all miÅ¿eries: for they Å¿hall bee
no more Å¿icke, weake, deformed, lame, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
hungry, thirÅ¿ty, and that which is the
greateÅ¿t of all, they Å¿hall ceaÅ¿e from Å¿inning
any more, for they Å¿hal be like the glorious
body of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, without Å¿pot or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿h.
And is not this a Å¿ingular comfort?
The fineÅ¿t body here, is but a carion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect
of the fouleÅ¿t there. In this day, <hi>the
righteous Å¿hall haue dominion ouer the
wicked, PÅ¿alm.</hi> 49. Dauid when he conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of this day Å¿o ioyfull, Å¿ayde, <hi>that his
heart did reioyce, becauÅ¿e his body Å¿hould
not for euer be left in the graue, PÅ¿alm.</hi> 16.
This day is called of Paul to <hi>Titus 2. The
bleÅ¿Å¿ed hope,</hi> of the effect which it hath to
make vs there all bleÅ¿Å¿ed without ende in
ioy vnÅ¿peakeable. This reÅ¿urrection,
which leadeth vnto euerlaÅ¿ting life, may
well be likened to the laÅ¿t doore, that in the
court or palace of kings, leadeth into the
princes priuy chamber, or the chamber of
preÅ¿ence: (for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> can haue no acceÅ¿Å¿e thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:179"/>
vntill he haue paÅ¿Å¿ed through many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doores and houÅ¿es:) Å¿o Å¿urely it is in
the life to come. We can not come or enter
into the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, euen the priuy
chamber of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and there behold
his preÅ¿ence, except we firÅ¿t paÅ¿Å¿e by many
doores in this life, which doe leade vs thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
as for example, we muÅ¿t firÅ¿t paÅ¿Å¿e by
our election, then by our creation, thirdly,
by our redemption, wrought by ChriÅ¿t vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the croÅ¿Å¿e, fourthly, by iuÅ¿tification, fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by Å¿anctification of life, and laÅ¿t of all,
we muÅ¿t come to the reÅ¿urrection, as the
laÅ¿t doore, if we will haue our finall glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
which is euerlaÅ¿ting life, to beholde
and inioy the Å¿weete and louing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Lorde. Yea Paul goeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Å¿ayth, <hi>that by many tribulations,</hi>
as Å¿trayte doores and gates, which wring
vs, <hi>wee muÅ¿t enter into the kingdome of
God.</hi> Needes therefore muÅ¿t the reÅ¿urrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be ioyfull, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> as it leadeth vs directly
to Å¿uch a palace of pleaÅ¿ure, as Å¿hall neuer
ende, &amp; therefore is called of <hi>Peter, the time
of refreÅ¿hing, both of bodye and Å¿oule,
in the preÅ¿ence of the Lorde, Actes</hi> 3. The
holy ApoÅ¿tle willed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>TheÅ¿Å¿alonians</hi> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them Å¿elues with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioyfull reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>brance
<pb facs="tcp:10917:180"/>
of this day. 1. <hi>TheÅ¿Å¿.</hi> 4. For it Å¿halbe vnto
vs as a new birth, or natiuitie in al purenes,
And if wee Å¿o celebrate the dayes of our
birth, wherein we were borne into a vale of
myÅ¿erye and troubles, howe ought wee to
celebrate and keepe holy this day, wherein
we Å¿hall be exempted from all curÅ¿es of
this preÅ¿ent life! This day is termed our
marriage day: if we reioyce here when we
are married to a mortall creature, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
to our greater payne, and trouble
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> before, oh dearely beloued, how Å¿hould
we be affected, &amp; what tokens of ioy ought
we to Å¿hewe foorth, when wee Å¿halbe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
to the Å¿onne of God ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us for
euer in fayth and trueth, with a band which
neuer Å¿halbe broken! as the Lord Å¿peaketh
in <hi>OÅ¿e</hi> 2. chapter, and <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 19. In this
day Å¿hall the gates of heauen be Å¿et wide
open vnto vs, which were Å¿hut vp before, &amp;
our bodies Å¿hall Å¿o much excell the bodyes
which we now beare about with vs, as the
Å¿unne doeth paÅ¿Å¿e and ouercome the moone
in brightneÅ¿Å¿e and light. O what a ioye is
this to haue our eÅ¿tate like vnto the bleÅ¿Å¿ed
Angels of God, moÅ¿t pure and diuine cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures!
If this cannot moue vs, I Å¿ee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may doe it. I am Å¿ure this reward
<pb facs="tcp:10917:180"/>
Å¿o moued good MoÅ¿es, that hee forÅ¿ooke
the kingdome in Egypt, and Å¿uffered paine
with the people of God, to come to this life
in the ende, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. Yea, this hope of life
to come, made Abraham to leaue his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and to goe to the land of Canaan as a
poore Å¿tranger, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. This made Paul
to go through thicke and thinne in this life,
that he might attayne to the reÅ¿urrection,
when he had Å¿eene the ioyes and pleaÅ¿ures,
that were Å¿hewed vnto him in ParadiÅ¿e,
when hee was taken vp thither, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
Of this ioy, our Sauiour gaue his diÅ¿ciples
a taÅ¿t in the Mount, when hee was tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
before them: but it was nothing in
reÅ¿pect of this. Nowe as theÅ¿e thinges are
moÅ¿t comfortable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly, to heare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their
bodyes Å¿hall be rayÅ¿ed vp to Å¿uch glory:
So is this day moÅ¿t fearefull to the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which haue here liued a diÅ¿Å¿olute life: For
they Å¿hall Å¿ay at that day to the hilles, Fall
vpon vs, and to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mountaynes, Couer vs.
but this Å¿hall not preuayle, for they Å¿halbe
raiÅ¿ed vp, but to their Å¿hame and confuÅ¿ion
for euer, as Daniel Å¿aith, <hi>Cha. 12. They Å¿hal
come forth (as our Å¿auiour Å¿ayth,) but to
the reÅ¿urrection of condemnation,</hi> and Å¿o
to be puniÅ¿hed from the preÅ¿ence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord
<pb facs="tcp:10917:181"/>
IeÅ¿us, with the <hi>worme of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿cience, which
Å¿hal neuer leaue to bite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, &amp; with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fire
which Å¿hal not be quenched:</hi> So they Å¿hal
periÅ¿h worthily through their owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and receiue the wages of vnrighteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e,
as they which count it pleaÅ¿ure, dayly
to liue dilitiouÅ¿ly. TheÅ¿e men would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
wiÅ¿he that this day might neuer be:
but it Å¿hal come vpon them, and that Å¿ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
and they Å¿halbe taken and Å¿nared, &amp;
not eÅ¿cape this iudgement. For they muÅ¿t
yeeld an accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t of al their vngodly works,
wherby they haue both diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed the Lord,
and euil intreated his Å¿ayntes here vpon
earth. Thus you haue heard (dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
brethren) the treatiÅ¿e of the reÅ¿urrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the Å¿criptures diÅ¿courÅ¿ed. FirÅ¿t how
that there is a generall riÅ¿ing of all fleÅ¿he.
Secondly, the endes wherefore it is orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
and then the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fortable doctrine, that
the godly by this may lay hold on, in all
miÅ¿eries of this life. Nowe it remayneth
for a finall concluÅ¿ion, that while we liue
here, we indeuour to haue our part in the
firÅ¿t reÅ¿urrection with ChriÅ¿t, that we may
by this come to the Å¿econd, and be bleÅ¿Å¿ed
with him. Let vs therefore giue thankes to
our Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, who is the reÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb facs="tcp:10917:181"/>
and the life, in that he hath vouchÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
to giue vnto vs an aÅ¿Å¿urance of it, in his
owne perÅ¿on, in that he roÅ¿e againe from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
dead. And let vs likewiÅ¿e pray vnto him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
we may Å¿o liue, as we may be children of
this happy reÅ¿urrection to life, hauing an
effectual fayth, with charitie which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
by loue in vs, that al our actions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oeuer,
may be Å¿eaÅ¿oned &amp; powdered with
it, preparing our Å¿elues againÅ¿t this day,
with mortifying of our fleÅ¿h: &amp; Å¿eeing wee
Å¿hal meete Å¿o victorious &amp; glorious a Lord,
comming in the cloudes, let vs purge our
Å¿elues from all filthineÅ¿Å¿e of the fleÅ¿he and
Å¿pirit, for no vncleane thing Å¿hall enter in
with him. God for his Å¿onnes Å¿ake, giue vs
the grace to doe theÅ¿e things: to the which
bleÅ¿Å¿ed and immortall God with the Å¿onne,
and the holy GhoÅ¿t, be rendred all prayÅ¿e,
glory and thankeÅ¿giuing, for euermore.

Å¿o y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ought to make vs wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>derful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amaÅ¿ed &amp; aÅ¿tonied, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿ider of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
they do Å¿o far exceede our capacitie, &amp; reach
of wit. The excellencie of this life may be
Å¿eene in theÅ¿e 2. things: firÅ¿t in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> happines
of our Å¿oule: then in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> welfare of our body.
As touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿oule, it Å¿halbe moÅ¿t happy,
for it Å¿hal ceaÅ¿e to Å¿in, &amp; Å¿halbe wholy ioyned
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord in faith &amp; truth, &amp; neuer diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e
him any more. What a great ioy is this! A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Å¿hal beautify our Å¿oule,
Å¿halbe moÅ¿t perfit: our knowledge, our wiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
our vnderÅ¿tanding, which here is all
darkned, Å¿hal there be inlightned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory
<pb facs="tcp:10917:184"/>
and light of the Lorde: all vertues and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of the minde Å¿hal abound in vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the full, and euery thing that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfite,
Å¿halbe then done away, no griefe of
the minde, no Å¿orow of heart, no torment
of conÅ¿cience any more, but peace, ioy and
tranquillity euer to endure. This is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
wherein wee were firÅ¿t created, and
Å¿hall then be renewed to a more perfite e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tate
of life, then it was in before the fall of
Adam. Our Å¿oule there Å¿hall not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
to the body, neither Å¿hall the Å¿pirit
rebel agaynÅ¿t the fleÅ¿he, but it Å¿hall loue the
Lord with all his might. And if the ioy of
the minde and Å¿oule be Å¿o great here many
times in the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of God, that they Å¿eeme
to be in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, what Å¿hal it be there (thinke
yee) when it Å¿halbe in full poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of all
his delights and Å¿pirituall pleaÅ¿ures, euer
Å¿inging and making Å¿weete melody to the
Lorde, and yet without any wearyneÅ¿Å¿e at
al? For olde things are al paÅ¿Å¿ed away, and
behold, all things Å¿hal become new againe,
and the thinges that are there, Å¿halbe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
For ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall giue vnto all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. This is the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the Å¿oule. Now let vs Å¿ee the bleÅ¿Å¿ed
eÅ¿tate alÅ¿o of the body, and that Å¿hall the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:184"/>
better appeare, if we compare it with the
Å¿tate that it is in here. Our bodies are nowe
deformed, there they Å¿hall be moÅ¿t faire and
beautifull, yea that which is more, they Å¿hal
be like the glorious and immortall bodie of
IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe. Here the body is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times maymed and vnperfit, there it Å¿hal
be perfite and in his integritie: here it is in
Å¿ickeneÅ¿Å¿e, in pouertie, in nakedneÅ¿Å¿e, in
woundes, in Å¿tripes, in botches, in Å¿ores, and
in all incurable diÅ¿eaÅ¿es: there Å¿hall it bee
whole and all Å¿ounde, rich and glorious, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with innocency, and neuer able to feele
any infirmitie any more. For heere it is
Å¿owen in diÅ¿honour, in weakeneÅ¿Å¿e, in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:
and there it riÅ¿eth in honour, in
power, in incorruption and immortalitie.
Here be many things that make it to offend
agaynÅ¿t God: there is nothing that Å¿hall
cauÅ¿e it to Å¿inne: it Å¿hall not, as it did here,
luÅ¿t againÅ¿t the Å¿pirit, but be at peace and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
with it: the Å¿ight of it moÅ¿t quicke in
Å¿eeing, and very perfite it Å¿hall be in all the
Å¿enÅ¿es, in hearing, in Å¿melling, in taÅ¿ting, in
handling. It Å¿hall haue all melody and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ike
to delite the eare, euen angels Å¿inging
continually: it Å¿hall haue all Å¿ightes and
Å¿hewes to delite and pleaÅ¿e the eye, euen the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:185"/>
perpetuall preÅ¿ence of the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Trinitie.
All odoriferous Å¿mels, as it were of muÅ¿ks,
perfumes, flowers, the Å¿weete incenÅ¿e of
praiÅ¿e and thankeÅ¿giuing, to Å¿mell delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
in the noÅ¿trels of the Lorde, and ours,
Å¿hall not there be wanting. O what a ioye
is this to the bodie, to haue all thinges at
commaundement, that may well pleaÅ¿e and
delight it! The pleaÅ¿ures of Kinges and
Queenes are nothing to thoÅ¿e things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we Å¿peake, yea the pleaÅ¿ures Å¿halbe Å¿o ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great, that if all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioyes &amp; paÅ¿times
of this life were compared vnto them, they
Å¿hould be founde to be but pangues and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Yea the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tinuance of all our delites
here for an hundred yeres, is not like to the
bleÅ¿Å¿ednes of one minute of an houre there,
nor worthy to be likened vnto it. For vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Å¿peake with Dauid, <hi>I had rather be
there but for one daye, then here a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and
yeeres,</hi> in all the triumphes that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
and Kings can make with all their
power. This is then the happines of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
Now howe great Å¿hall the bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e
be, when both the body and Å¿oule Å¿halbe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
together, and raigne for euermore<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
Surely as great as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of the Lorde is,
&amp; his excellent MaieÅ¿tie, which is infinite:
<pb facs="tcp:10917:185"/>
Å¿o great Å¿hall this glory of the Saintes be.
The loue of this life, which is euerlaÅ¿ting,
Å¿hould make (me thinks) kings &amp; princes to
do their dueties to the Lord, to raigne ouer,
&amp; gouerne their Å¿ubiects in iuÅ¿tice &amp; equity,
and not to liue in pleaÅ¿ures. The reÅ¿pect of
theÅ¿e ioyes Å¿houlde make CounÅ¿ellers to
Å¿peake the trueth boldely, &amp; Å¿yncerely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
flattering and diÅ¿Å¿imulation to princes,
conÅ¿idering what a rewarde is layde vp for
them in heauen. This Å¿houlde make all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hops
and miniÅ¿ters of the worde, to do their
duetie in reprehending Å¿inne Å¿toutly, and in
contemning this vayne worlde, in teaching
the flock without lucre &amp; gayne, Å¿eeing that
<hi>when the great Å¿hepherd IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t Å¿hal
appeare, they Å¿hal receiue an incorruptible
crowne of glory, 1. Pet.</hi> 5. Finally, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of this life, which is for euer, might
make euery eÅ¿tate and degree in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
either hie or lowe, to doe moÅ¿t cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
their Å¿euerall dueties to all men, that
in the ende their parte may bee in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
inheritaunce, which fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
O that our mindes were erected vp
to theÅ¿e thinges, they woulde not Å¿o light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bee carryed away to Å¿inne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e,
fearing leaÅ¿t we Å¿houlde leeÅ¿e theÅ¿e
<pb facs="tcp:10917:186"/>
euerlaÅ¿ting ioyes. This is the rewarde that
ChriÅ¿t hath promiÅ¿ed to them, that followe
him here, in the regeneration, that haue
for his names Å¿ake forÅ¿aken houÅ¿es, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
Å¿iÅ¿ters, father, mother, wyfe, children
and landes, they Å¿hall inherite all things,
euen euerlaÅ¿ting life, Matth. 19. This life
Å¿halbe moÅ¿t happie and ioyfull, eyther in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect
of the perÅ¿ons, with whome we Å¿hall
be, or elÅ¿e in reÅ¿pect of the place, which is
heauen, the Å¿eate of God, or in the conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the time, which is for euer. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
wee be here many times in a good
place, yet if our company be not good &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿t,
this can be no delite to a godly man.
Nowe in heauen we Å¿hall haue the glorious
fruition of the Father, the Sonne, &amp; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
GhoÅ¿t, the Å¿ocietie of all the angels, moÅ¿t
excellent creatures, the company of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes,
the Prophets, the ApoÅ¿tles, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hoÅ¿te of Martyrs, briefly the fellowÅ¿hip
of all the elect &amp; Saintes of God, that euer
haue bin. This can not be but an vnÅ¿peaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
delite to vs all, when we conÅ¿ider of it.
Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dly, we Å¿halbe bleÅ¿Å¿ed in reÅ¿pect of the
place, for otherwiÅ¿e, if the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pany be good, &amp;
yet the place not correÅ¿pondent vnto it in al
things, as not being large ynough, or Å¿weet,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:186"/>
or glorious, there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> be no great delite there:
but this place is moÅ¿t anÅ¿wereable to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
wide &amp; large, faire, Å¿weete &amp; glorious,
euen the heauen of heauens, the Å¿eate of the
Almighty, a place of ioy, a place of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fort, a
place of all Å¿pirituall delectation. S. Iohn
Å¿eeing it in the Å¿pirit, hath deÅ¿cribed it as far
forth as fleÅ¿h &amp; blood can conceaue of it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
earthly things. <hi>I Å¿awe</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>a newe
heauen &amp; a new earth, &amp; I Å¿aw the holy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
new IeruÅ¿alem, come down from God
out of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, prepared as a bride trimmed
for her husband.</hi> Iohn compareth the place
wherein we Å¿halbe, to a citie moÅ¿t glorious
&amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, whoÅ¿e Å¿hining was like to a Å¿tone
moÅ¿t precious, as a IaÅ¿per Å¿tone, cleare as
ChryÅ¿tal, whoÅ¿e wal was great &amp; hie, which
had twelue gates, &amp; at the gates twelue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
The wal of the citie had twelue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which were garniÅ¿hed with all maner
of precious Å¿tones, as IaÅ¿pers, Saphires,
Emeraudes, &amp; Å¿uch like, the building of the
wall is of IaÅ¿per, &amp; the citie was al of pure
golde, like vnto cleare glaÅ¿Å¿e. The twelue
gates were twelue pearles, and the Å¿treete
of the citie is pure golde, as Å¿hining glaÅ¿Å¿e.
This Citie hath no neede of the Å¿unne, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the moone to Å¿hine in it, for the glory
<pb facs="tcp:10917:187"/>
of God did light it, &amp; the Lambe is the light
of it. The gates of it Å¿hall not bee Å¿hutte
by day, for there Å¿halbe no night there, there
Å¿hall be no death, no Å¿orowe, no crying, no
payne, for the firÅ¿t things are paÅ¿Å¿ed. There
Å¿halbe a pure riuer of water of life, cleare
as ChriÅ¿tall, and the tree of life bearing
twelue maner of fruites. And there Å¿hall
be no more curÅ¿e, but Gods Å¿eruantes Å¿hall
raygne there for euermore. This is the
place, which Iohn hath Å¿hadowed out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, as well as he could vnder theÅ¿e ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿triall
benefites of golde, and Å¿iluer, and
precious Å¿tones, whereas in deede it can
not be deÅ¿cribed as it is in it Å¿elfe, becauÅ¿e
no man hath Å¿eene it, and we beyng groÅ¿Å¿e
and carnall, muÅ¿t haue it by carnall and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible
thinges Å¿et foorth vnto vs. Thirdly,
the excellencie of this life is Å¿eene in the
continuance of it, in that, that it neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth
or waxeth olde. If here belowe we
had all pleaÅ¿ures &amp; delites both for the Å¿oule
and body, yea although the place we were
in, were moÅ¿t excellent &amp; glorious, and the
company in al reÅ¿pects according to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire,
good, pleaÅ¿ant and honeÅ¿t: yet if theÅ¿e
thinges were but for a dayes, or an houres
continuance, what great contentation of
<pb facs="tcp:10917:187"/>
minde, or recreation for the body might be
here, Å¿eeing wee muÅ¿t depart very Å¿hortly
from theÅ¿e pleaÅ¿ures? and then it had him as
good, if they had not bene at al. For all theÅ¿e
thinges are like vnto pleaÅ¿ant muÅ¿ike, in a
Å¿ette of viols, which when they ceaÅ¿e once,
(and ceaÅ¿e needes muÅ¿t euery thing in this
life, be it neuer Å¿o pleaÅ¿ant) then it is al one,
as if wee had neuer heard this muÅ¿ike, Å¿o
Å¿weete and delectable to our eares, there is
no print or token of it left behinde, but al va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿heth
away with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very Å¿taying of it: <hi>Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
as after the flying of a birde in the ayre, or
the paÅ¿Å¿ing of a Å¿hip in the Å¿ea, there is no
trace found after them, WiÅ¿.</hi> 5. But dearely
beloued, beleue me, this life Å¿hal haue yeres
without ende in vnÅ¿peakeable ioy, in this Å¿o
excellent a place, we Å¿hal heare muÅ¿ike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
and yet it Å¿hal neuer ceaÅ¿e, nor we
be wearie to heare it. And when we haue
bene there in theÅ¿e delightes Å¿o long, and Å¿o
many thouÅ¿ande yeeres, as there be eyther
Å¿andes in the Å¿ea, or graÅ¿Å¿es vpon the whole
face of the earth, or Å¿tarres in the Å¿kye,
which all are inmunerable to vs: yet then
we Å¿hal not come out, or leaue theÅ¿e ioyes,
but Å¿till it is with vs, as if it were to begin.
O the vnÅ¿peakable mercy of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord IeÅ¿us,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:188"/>
that he hath reÅ¿erued for thoÅ¿e that feare and
loue him here! What man therefore is Å¿o
fooliÅ¿h, Å¿o madde, Å¿o beaÅ¿tlike in his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ation,
that will not at all be mooued with
theÅ¿e pleaÅ¿ures and ioyes! <hi>For theÅ¿e things,</hi>
as the Angel Å¿ayd to Iohn, <hi>are faithfull and
true,</hi> and therefore to be beleeued, and they
that beleeue them not, their parte is in the
lake that burneth with fire and brimÅ¿tone,
which is prepared for the vnbeleeuers, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uela.</hi>
21. For from this roote of vnbeleefe,
proceede all the branches of all other Å¿innes
&amp; wickednes whatÅ¿oeuer, as lying, Å¿tealing,
couetouÅ¿nes, adulterie, and Å¿uch like. This
life and the dignitie of it, the Prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
in two wordes hath very well expreÅ¿Å¿ed
in his 16. PÅ¿alme, the latter ende, <hi>Thou
wilt</hi> (Å¿ayeth he) <hi>Å¿hewe me the path of life:
in thy preÅ¿ence is the fulneÅ¿Å¿e of ioye, and
at thy right hande there are pleaÅ¿ures for
euermore.</hi> Here, in fulneÅ¿Å¿e of ioye and
pleaÅ¿ures for euermore, is all happineÅ¿Å¿e
contayned. For theÅ¿e ioyes are the greateÅ¿t
that may be, and their endurance is for euer.
ConÅ¿idering theÅ¿e things, ought we not to
Å¿ay with Paul? <hi>I count that the afflictions
of this preÅ¿ent time, are not worthy of the
glory that Å¿halbe Å¿hewed vnto vs, Rom.</hi> 8.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:188"/>
Why, alas then (dearely beloued) what a
great matter were it, if we Å¿houlde endure
here afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s al the dayes of our life, which
can not be aboue an hundred yeeres at the
moÅ¿t, Å¿o we might come in the ende to this
eternall ioye and glory? Paul conÅ¿idered
this well, and did Å¿o doe. <hi>We faynt not,</hi>
(Å¿ayth he) <hi>but though our outwarde man
periÅ¿h, yet the inwarde man is renewed
dayly.</hi> Marke well the wordes that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,
and laye them vp in your mindes,
and you Å¿hall, by the grace of God, profite
thereby. For our light affliction, which is
but for a moment, cauÅ¿eth vnto vs a farre
moÅ¿t excellent, and an eternall weyght of
glory, whyle we looke not on the thinges
which are Å¿eene, but on the thinges which
are not Å¿eene. <hi>For the thinges which are
Å¿eene, are temporall, but the things which
are not Å¿eene, are eternall, 2. Corinth.</hi> 4.
Shall we then for an houres pleaÅ¿ure here
below, leeÅ¿e the euerlaÅ¿ting weyght of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
aboue? God forbid we Å¿houlde be Å¿o foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h,
and Å¿o beÅ¿otted with this preÅ¿ent lyfe.
Let this Å¿aying rather of our Sauiour
ChriÅ¿t Å¿ounde continually in your eares:
<hi>What Å¿hall it profite a man if he winne the
whole worlde, and leeÅ¿e his owne Å¿oule?</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10917:189"/>
And yet wee Å¿ee, howe many men do hazarde
and venture their Å¿oule, not for the whole
worlde, but for a piece of lande, a litle golde
or Å¿iluer, or a litle credite or vayne eÅ¿tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this worlde. If the whole earth then
will not bee able to make a recompence or
an exchange to redeeme our Å¿oules, beyng
once loÅ¿t from the fauour of God, howe
much leÅ¿Å¿e then Å¿hall theÅ¿e beggerly things,
wherefore we Å¿triue Å¿o earneÅ¿tly, be able to
doe it? Nowe although this life be yet as
it were hid from vs, yet it is moÅ¿t certaine:
both becauÅ¿e we haue a gage of it, which is
the Spirite it Å¿elfe of ChriÅ¿t, and alÅ¿o, inaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it is hid in ChriÅ¿t, which will
keepe it well, and is able to giue it to vs
in due time. In the meane Å¿eaÅ¿on, vntill it
be reuealed from heauen, we neede faith to
beleeue it aÅ¿Å¿uredly, and hope to wayte for
it with patience, which hope neuer maketh
a man aÅ¿hamed, but alwayes comforteth
him euen in the middeÅ¿t of troubles of this
life, be they neuer Å¿o great. For we do well
knowe, that when hee doeth appeare, wee
Å¿hall be like vnto him, and no man neede to
doubt, but that there is Å¿uch a life, although
it doeth not yet Å¿eeme Å¿o to vs: for there is
a Sunne, when it is compaÅ¿Å¿ed in with
<pb facs="tcp:10917:189"/>
cloudes, and fire is within the aÅ¿hes, when
it appeareth not to our Å¿ight: Å¿o there is a
life for the godly, although deferred, which
ChriÅ¿t hath promiÅ¿ed and Å¿poken of, Matth.
25. that it Å¿halbe giuen to his Å¿erua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts. This
life euerlaÅ¿ting, being Å¿o deare a thing and
precious, the deuill goeth about by all
meanes, to defeate vs of it, and to plucke it
out of our hand. Therfore we muÅ¿t lay hold
on it, as Paul willed Timothie, <hi>and fight
the good fight of faith againÅ¿t him.</hi> This
is our <hi>crowne which we muÅ¿t holde faÅ¿t,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
no man bereaue vs of it. For if we miÅ¿Å¿e of
life in the end we miÅ¿Å¿e of all, and if we haue
this, wee haue and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e all thinges, for
all bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e whatÅ¿oeuer is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vnder the name of euerlaÅ¿ting lyfe.
But the beÅ¿t comfort for vs is this, that this
life is in the cuÅ¿todie of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and
wee beyng his Å¿heepe, no man is able to
plucke vs out of his handes: onely this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth
for vs to looke vnto, that we abide
and continue in his fold. Eternal life being
the euerlaÅ¿ting inheritance of the kingdom
of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, the greateÅ¿t treaÅ¿ure that the Lord
hath to beÅ¿tow vpon his Å¿eruantes, no man
muÅ¿t thinke, that it commeth to him for
<pb facs="tcp:10917:190"/>
his good works Å¿ake, or that he doth deÅ¿erue
it at Gods hand: this were to preiudice and
ouerthrowe the bountifull goodneÅ¿Å¿e of the
Lord. This benefite is the free gift of God,
for although wee deÅ¿erue hell and death by
our Å¿inne and wickednes, yet we merit not
heauen by our good deedes, but as Paul
Å¿ayeth, <hi>EuerlaÅ¿ting life is the free gift of
God, Rom.</hi> 6. And ChriÅ¿t telleth vs, that
<hi>this kingdome was prepared for vs long
agoe, euen before the worlde</hi> was made,
or we borne, Å¿o that we coulde not Å¿tep one
foote vnto it of our Å¿elues, when we were
not, Matth. 25. It is falÅ¿e then that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿aries
of ChriÅ¿t, the PapiÅ¿tes, haue
taught, that wee may deÅ¿erue this life by
our good deedes and workes, when as our
good deedes are not pure in the Å¿ight of the
Lorde. In deede, if our good workes were
eyther perfect, or as many as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth,
or if they were our owne, and
not Gods giftes in vs, or if laÅ¿t of all wee
were not bounde of duetie and by right to
doe them, then might wee with our owne
good works deÅ¿erue heauen: but our deedes
are vnperfite, they are not our owne, of
duetie muÅ¿t we doe them, therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erue
nothing, as of duetie from the Lorde.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:190"/>
I graunt that euerlaÅ¿ting life is called by
our Sauiour a <hi>rewarde,</hi> but a rewarde is
not of deÅ¿ert or merit, but of curteÅ¿ie. A No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
man may rewarde his tenant for a thing
not woorth a Å¿hilling, by Å¿uch a gifte as is
worth twentie Å¿hillinges: Å¿hall he therefore
Å¿aye, that is the poore man, that, becauÅ¿e he
hath this rewarde, he hath deÅ¿erued it? If he
Å¿o do, he doth very vnthankfully. When the
Å¿eruant hath done his duetie, can he clayme
any thing of his maÅ¿ter by merite? <hi>I trowe
no,</hi> Å¿ayeth our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.
Neyther doeth the maÅ¿ter thanke him: So
we, if we had done all things commaunded
vnto vs, (as we are farre from performing
the leaÅ¿t of them) yet we are vnprofitable
Å¿eruants: and what doth an vnprofitable Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
deÅ¿erue at the Lordes handes? Surely
not the kingdome of heauen: if he deÅ¿erue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, it is Å¿tripes. Let vs not therefore
thinke, that we can deÅ¿erue ought at Gods
handes, or gratifie and pleaÅ¿ure him, Å¿o that
he Å¿houlde be beholding to vs, &amp; of duetie to
do any thing for vs. This is a very deuiliÅ¿h
opinion. ChriÅ¿t hath deÅ¿erued at Gods ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ds
all thinges neceÅ¿Å¿arie for vs: therefore if
we be in ChriÅ¿t, we Å¿hall haue all thinges
wee can deÅ¿ire. The lande of Canaan,

<pb facs="tcp:10917:192"/>
that this fooliÅ¿hneÅ¿Å¿e Å¿houlde enter into the
heart of any man. Seeing then al theÅ¿e Å¿mal
things come not for our owne deÅ¿erts vnto
vs, but for his ChriÅ¿tes Å¿ake, much more
muÅ¿t we aÅ¿cribe to his goodneÅ¿Å¿e this great
benefite of life euerlaÅ¿ting. As concerning
this life to come, to aÅ¿ke, as many do fondly
and curiouÅ¿ly, rather then godlily, whether
wee Å¿hall knowe one another, or whether
we Å¿hal all be alike in degree: I thinke theÅ¿e
queÅ¿tions to be Å¿uch as S. Paul <hi>willeth vs
to eÅ¿chew &amp; put away farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vs.</hi> This is
certaine, our knowledge there Å¿hall be moÅ¿t
perfite and abÅ¿olute: for then Å¿hall I knowe
as I am knowen, and no ignorance of any
thing that is neceÅ¿Å¿arie, Å¿hall be in vs, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man Å¿hall bee contented, and haue his
full ioye in all meaÅ¿ure of his quantitie,
Å¿o that the leaÅ¿t pynte potte Å¿hall be as full
for his meaÅ¿ure, as the greateÅ¿t tunne is
with his quantitie. <hi>All men there Å¿hall
haue fulneÅ¿Å¿e of ioye, PÅ¿alme</hi> 16. The
Lord Å¿ende vs thyther, and we will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with the loweÅ¿t roune, as Dauid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ed
of himÅ¿elfe. The beÅ¿t queÅ¿tion for al to
aÅ¿ke, eÅ¿pecially of the Å¿imple and vnlearned,
is, to know throughly the way that bringeth
vs thither, which is onely IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:192"/>
                     <hi>the way, the trueth, and the life, Iohn</hi> 14.
And Å¿o dyd our Sauiour anÅ¿were: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
curiouÅ¿ly demaunded of one, howe
many Å¿houlde be Å¿aued: he tolde him the
meanes howe he Å¿houlde be Å¿aued. And Å¿o
muÅ¿t wee doe alÅ¿o, and not feede the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of men, or delite their vaine humors.
I am Å¿ure there bee many men that will
aÅ¿ke what we Å¿hall doe in heauen, and what
we Å¿hall eate and drinke, or whether we Å¿hal
be clothed there: which can not tell howe
to come thither, if they were demaunded
the queÅ¿tion. And what a madneÅ¿Å¿e is this,
to Å¿triue for the Å¿hadowe, and to let the body
goe? to enquire to knowe things which we
are not commaunded to Å¿earch after, and to
let goe thoÅ¿e things which we are bound to
knowe? And this vice is moÅ¿t common to
them whom we terme fine witted felowes,
which contemne common and neceÅ¿Å¿arie
queÅ¿tions, to Å¿eeke out deepe and profound
queÅ¿tions, nothing at all tending to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e,
but rather to the Å¿ubuerÅ¿ion and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
of all religion and honeÅ¿tie. TheÅ¿e
men the holy GhoÅ¿t doeth wil vs to auoide,
and Å¿eeing they are fooles, to anÅ¿were them
with Å¿ilence to their fooliÅ¿h queÅ¿tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s. TheÅ¿e
things breede Å¿trife and controuerÅ¿ie about
<pb facs="tcp:10917:193"/>
words, and they are like to that Å¿erpent
Hidra, which of one idle head, bring foorth a
great manie to deÅ¿truction. Here is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made of hel or of death, becauÅ¿e all that
is in this confeÅ¿Å¿ion of fayth, is Å¿et downe
for the onely comfort of the godly, and not
for their terrour. NotwithÅ¿tanding as there
is a life, and a great rewarde for the godly
after this race is ended: So is there a hell,
and Å¿econde, death prepared of olde for the
wicked and reprobate. For our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
ChriÅ¿t Å¿peaking of this life, Å¿peaketh
alÅ¿o ioyntly of the euerlaÅ¿ting deÅ¿truction
in fire, which is for the deuill and all his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and thoÅ¿e that in this life haue Å¿erued
him here with their bodies and Å¿oules, and
all their members. <hi>TheÅ¿e</hi> (Å¿ayeth ChriÅ¿t)
<hi>Å¿hall goe into euerlaÅ¿ting payne, Matt.</hi> 25.
Where Origen and all thoÅ¿e that thought
this payne Å¿hould not be for euer, are moÅ¿t
playnely confuted: for ChriÅ¿t affirmeth it
to haue no ende. To this Å¿aying of ChriÅ¿t
agreeth that in EÅ¿ay the 30. Chapter, verÅ¿e
33. <hi>Tophet is prepared of olde, it is euen
prepared for the King, hee hath made it
deepe and large: the burning thereof is
fire and much wood: the breath of the
Lorde like a riuer of brimÅ¿tone, doeth
<pb facs="tcp:10917:193"/>
kindle it.</hi> Here is a full deÅ¿cription of hell:
For by Tophet he meaneth hell. He decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
moreouer when it was made, euen of
olde, for whom alÅ¿o, for the King, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the King of Babylon, enemie to the
Church, Å¿ignifying that God reÅ¿pecteth no
mans perÅ¿on, but that hell is as well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for Kings and Queenes, for Lords
and Ladies, and for great men, as well as
the poore, that doe not beleeue. Yea, the
greateÅ¿t part of men goeth this way, in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
eÅ¿tate and degree: Å¿o that we had neede
to looke about vs, <hi>to enter in at the Å¿traight
gate, for fewe there be that finde it, but
many that paÅ¿Å¿e by the broade way. Matt.</hi>
7. For this Tophet is deepe &amp; large to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
and to receyue many, yea moe noble
men Å¿hall go thither then to heauen. The
Prophete deÅ¿cribeth the payne of it, by fire
burning with much wood: the continuance
is for euer, becauÅ¿e the breath of the Lorde
which endureth for euer, doeth kindle the
fire, as a riuer of brimÅ¿tone. The ioyes then
of heauen are not Å¿o inÅ¿peakable, but that
the torments and pangs of hell are as into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.
Wherefore the wicked, although
they be not moued with the pleaÅ¿ures at the
right hand of God, to come vnto him by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
<pb facs="tcp:10917:194"/>
yet in my iudgement the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great tormentes of endleÅ¿Å¿e hell fire
Å¿houlde moue them to amende. For Å¿urely
(dearely beloued) if all the paynes that
may be deuiÅ¿ed in this life, all the Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿es
that euer haue bene, all the torments of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
all the griefes of minde that may be,
were all of them layde together, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to this hell fire, theÅ¿e paynes howe
great Å¿oeuer they Å¿eeme to be here, are but
fleabytings, yea rather pleaÅ¿ures, in reÅ¿pect
of this helliÅ¿h fire, it is Å¿o great. And this
fire although it be Å¿o great, yet Å¿hall it burne
for euer and euer, not onely the body, but
alÅ¿o the Å¿oule, the minde, the conÅ¿cience, and
all the inner parts of the damned Å¿ort. And
when they haue beene there as many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouÅ¿ande yeeres, as there are peeble
Å¿tones in the Å¿ea Å¿hore, yet Å¿hal they not then
come out, but continue Å¿till, as if they were
to beginne anewe. For ChriÅ¿ts wordes are
true, this <hi>fire is euerlaÅ¿ting, and can neuer
be quenched, Matthewe 3. &amp;</hi> 25. It were
well with Iudas, if he myght come out of
this wofull hell and paynes, when he hath
Å¿uffered them Å¿o many hundred thouÅ¿ande
millions of yeeres, as there are Å¿tarres in
the firmament: but this can not be granted
<pb facs="tcp:10917:194"/>
vnto him. If men therefore woulde conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of theÅ¿e two extremities, wherein is no
meane: of the ioyes of paradiÅ¿e which are
endleÅ¿Å¿e, and of the torments of hell and the
wrath of God, which alÅ¿o hath no ende: then
Å¿urely woulde they liue in feare and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e
in this preÅ¿ent worlde. For as heauen
is full of ioy and mirth: Å¿o hell is full of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
and Å¿orowe: and as in heauen is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
reioycing and peace of minde: Å¿o is there
in hell a perpetuall weeping, with gnaÅ¿hing
of teeth for woe and payne. As the glorie of
the Lorde Å¿hall inlyghten the elect with his
gratious countenance: Å¿o Å¿hall the great
maieÅ¿tie &amp; wrath of the Lorde, preÅ¿Å¿e downe
the vngodly for euer. Finally, as in heauen
the Å¿aintes Å¿hall haue all things to do them
good that they can deÅ¿ire: Å¿o in hell the
damned Å¿pirits Å¿hal haue nothing to refreÅ¿h
them, not Å¿o much as a droppe of colde wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
(which is but a Å¿mall thing) to coole
their tongue withall. And as I Å¿ayde before
of heauen and heauenly ioyes, Å¿o may I
Å¿peake of this Å¿econde death: that if all the
men in the whole worlde woulde go about
to expreÅ¿Å¿e theÅ¿e tormentes, with all their
eloquence and learning, yet Å¿hall they bee
neuer able to doe it: they are Å¿o vnÅ¿peake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:10917:195"/>
and not to be vttered of any man. And
theÅ¿e are the righteous iudgementes of the
Lord, that he to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked might be knowen
to be a iuÅ¿t and a terrible God, to rewarde
impenitent Å¿inners after their woorkes, as
they haue deÅ¿erued. For this ende, Å¿ayeth
the Lorde to Pharao, I haue Å¿tirred thee
vp, that I myght Å¿hewe my great power
and myght vpon thee, in puniÅ¿hing thee
accordingly. Let the wicked therefore
take heede, for there will come a day that
will pay for all: and then what aduantage
will it be, to haue gotten an houres plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure,
with the purchaÅ¿e of euerlaÅ¿ting
woes? But theÅ¿e things, and theÅ¿e euils, by
the benefite of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t are farre from
vs, and Å¿hall not come neere the dwelling
of the righteous. Wherefore wee ought
with Paul <hi>to giue thankes alway to God,
becauÅ¿e that from the beginning he hath
choÅ¿en vs to Å¿aluation, through Å¿anctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Å¿pirite,</hi> and beleefe of the trueth:
neyther hath he appoynted vs to wrath as he
hath the wicked, but to obtaine this euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting
life, whereof we Å¿peake, by the meanes
of our Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, which died for vs,
that whether we Å¿leepe or wake, we Å¿houlde
liue together with him. In the meane Å¿ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on
<pb facs="tcp:10917:195"/>
it is our part to Å¿tande faÅ¿t, and not to
bee remoued from this faith, but to laye
hande of this eternall life, whereunto wee
through the benefit of the GoÅ¿pel preached,
are called freely of GOD, with an holy
calling, not according to our workes, but
of his goodneÅ¿Å¿e. Wee muÅ¿t alÅ¿o fight this
good fight of faith, and Å¿triue lawfully: if
we hope to bee crowned, and to continue to
the ende, wee muÅ¿t endeuour that wee may
bee Å¿aued: for they that Å¿hrinke backe, leeÅ¿e
this excellent reward, for the which we are
commaunded <hi>to Å¿ell all that we haue, and
to bye it, Matth.</hi> 13. We haue nowe heard
the meaning of all the twelue articles of
our ChriÅ¿tian fayth, which are neceÅ¿Å¿arie
to Å¿aluation: FirÅ¿t, wee haue Å¿eene the
article that concerneth our truÅ¿t in God the
Father, &amp; what things we learne by it: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
we haue declared the articles which
conteine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> myÅ¿teries of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us with
our redemption &amp; glorification, and other
benefits apperteining thereunto. Thirdly,
the beleefe in the holy GhoÅ¿t, the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on
in Trinitie, hath bene opened vnto vs,
and what comfort may thereof ariÅ¿e to the
faithfull: Fourthly and laÅ¿tly, the articles
<pb facs="tcp:10917:196"/>
concerning the Church and the benefites
thereto belonging, haue beene expounded
as God hath giuen vs grace. TheÅ¿e things
are written, that we might beleeue that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us
ChriÅ¿t is the Sonne of God, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
of the world, and that in beleeuing we
myght haue life through this name: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then wee haue hearde theÅ¿e thinges,
let vs, as the holy and bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tle of
ChriÅ¿t, Saint Peter, willeth vs, be ready
alwayes to giue an anÅ¿were to euery man
that aÅ¿keth vs a reaÅ¿on of the fayth and hope
that is in vs, with meekeneÅ¿Å¿e and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
And nowe let vs giue thankes as
wee are continually bounde, to our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father, in that it hath pleaÅ¿ed him to
make vs ChriÅ¿tians to beleeue theÅ¿e arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of our fayth, to our great and endleÅ¿Å¿e
comfort. And let vs pray vnto him withall
in the name of his welbeloued Sonne,
that he would giue vs grace to growe more
and more euery day in this fayth, that wee
may not onely liue in it, but alÅ¿o in the ende
of our dayes, die in it moÅ¿t conÅ¿tantly,
that Å¿o wee may bee bleÅ¿Å¿ed: And that it
woulde pleaÅ¿e him to giue this grace, not
only to vs, but to all people &amp; nations of the
earth, eÅ¿pecially to his vniuerÅ¿all Church,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:196"/>
whereÅ¿oeuer it be diÅ¿perÅ¿ed abroade in all
quarters of the earth. And in this Church
let vs pray for the Å¿tate of all Kinges and
Princes, that wee may liue a godly and
quiet life, with all peace and honeÅ¿tie: eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
let vs commende to his fauour the
Church of Englande, deÅ¿iring him to bleÅ¿Å¿e
it as hee hath done theÅ¿e many yeeres, and
to continue his holy GoÅ¿pel amongÅ¿t vs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
wee for our vnthankfulneÅ¿Å¿e haue
deÅ¿erued to haue it taken away from vs
long agoe. DeÅ¿yre wee of him, in mercy
Å¿till to beholde his Å¿eruant and handmaide,
our Queene and Å¿oueraigne, that Å¿hee may
bee Å¿till zealous to Å¿et forwarde the GoÅ¿pell
of ChriÅ¿t, and to roote vp all Å¿uperÅ¿tition
and idolatrie within her realme, that Å¿hee
may bee wiÅ¿e to foreÅ¿ee and preuent all miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
and dangers, that are likely to hang
ouer our heades, that Å¿o Å¿hee may haue a

the profite and commoditie of all her louing

the better ouerÅ¿eeing and gouernment of
this ChriÅ¿tian common wealth wherein
they liue, that all their counÅ¿elles and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,

that if it be his will, he would giue to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

mortall man, but of the
Lorde IeÅ¿us himÅ¿elfe, that
as often as wee come vnto
it, (for often it is to be receiued) we Å¿houlde
reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ber y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great loue of our maÅ¿ter ChriÅ¿t,
who loued vs Å¿o well, that he gaue his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and blood for to redeeme vs from all our
Å¿innes. That this great benefite Å¿hould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be forgotten of ChriÅ¿tians, he inÅ¿tituted
that we Å¿houlde receiue bread and wine, in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remembrance of his death, &amp; therfore this
Å¿acrament hath two partes: the one is the
outward Å¿ignes, bread and wine, to put vs in
mind, that as bread doth nouriÅ¿h the body, Å¿o
doth ChriÅ¿ts body nouriÅ¿h our Å¿oules, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
Å¿piritually by faith into our heartes, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe.
3. 17. &amp; as wine doth refreÅ¿h vs, &amp; que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ch
our thirÅ¿t, Å¿o doeth his blood refreÅ¿h our
minds, and waÅ¿h them from Å¿inne, &amp; quench
the Å¿piritual thirÅ¿t of our Å¿oules: and this Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of ChriÅ¿tes death is not giuen vs
in bread onely, but in wine alÅ¿o, to teach vs
<pb facs="tcp:10917:199"/>
that IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is all in all vnto vs, not
only meate to feede vs, Iohn 6. 35. but alÅ¿o
drinke to quench our thirÅ¿t, as he Å¿aith, Iohn
7. 37. If any man thirÅ¿t, let him come to me
and drinke. And Å¿o hee is alÅ¿o our apparell:
Put you on the Lorde IeÅ¿us, Rom. 13. 14.
The other part of this Supper is Å¿piritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
the remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes, and heauenly
graces receiued of vs, as truely as wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the Å¿ignes of them, if wee beleeue: for
this is to confirme our faith in this matter,
that we Å¿houlde doubt no more of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
then we doubt whether we haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the viÅ¿ible Å¿ignes. Nowe for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to this Supper, that wee deceiue not
our Å¿elues, we muÅ¿t haue theÅ¿e two things:
firÅ¿t, repentance of our former Å¿infull life,
to bee Å¿orie for it which is done, by trying
and examining our Å¿elues, whether wee bee
heartily Å¿orowfull or no for our offences: Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
we muÅ¿t haue faith in IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yet we deÅ¿paire not for our great Å¿innes,
but truÅ¿t to haue mercy at his handes when
we cal vpon him, Å¿o that before we come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this banket, wee muÅ¿t prepare our Å¿elues
to come worthily, reuerently, in faith, hope,
and loue: this is the examination. In recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of it our mindes muÅ¿t not bee on the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:199"/>
bread and wine, or vpon any other earthly
thinges, but vpon the body and blood of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us
ChriÅ¿t in heauen, Å¿ignified vnto vs by
theÅ¿e things belowe. After wee haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
wee muÅ¿t giue vnto ChriÅ¿te moÅ¿t
humble and heartie thankes, for feeding vs
with his body and blood, and meditate and
thinke vpon this continually, &amp; not returne
to our olde life againe. Thus doing, you
Å¿hal be Å¿ure to come as the Lorde requireth,
and as a good ChriÅ¿tian ought to do. Which
the Lorde graunt vnto you for his mercies
Å¿ake, Amen.</p>

vs for an accuÅ¿er to accuÅ¿e vs before the

declare the wrath and iudgement of God
ouer vs, and his condemnation vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
death, and by this meane to make vs
afraide, and to bring vs vnto diÅ¿paire, vntill
we be comforted by the GoÅ¿pell, through

For the reÅ¿t, I confeÅ¿Å¿e that the lawe
of the Lorde is good, iuÅ¿t, holy, and perfit,
and where the Å¿ame doth not bring vs vnto
perfection, it is not long of it Å¿elfe, but of
vs, which are altogether vnperfect, and can

Idolatrie was the fynding out and inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

to the great offence of the Å¿oules of men,
and are as Å¿nares and trappes for the feete
of the ignorant to make them to fal. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ought not to be honoured, Å¿erued,
worÅ¿hipped, neyther to bee Å¿uffered in the
Temples or Churches, neyther in any
other places, where ChriÅ¿tian people doe
meete together, to heare and vnderÅ¿tande
the word of God, but rather the Å¿ame ought
vtterly to bee taken awaye and throwen
downe, according to the effect of the Å¿econd
commandement of God, and that ought to
bee done by the common authoritie of the
MagiÅ¿trate, and not by the priuate autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of any particular man. For the wood
of the gallowes whereby iuÅ¿tice is done, is
bleÅ¿Å¿ed of GOD, but the Image made
by mans hande is accurÅ¿ed of the Lorde,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:236"/>
and Å¿o is he that made it. And therefore
wee ought to beware of Images aboue
