         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that diuers both of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen,
and others, haue very
paynefully and fruitefully la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured,
to ſet forth the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
and meaning, both of
the ten Commandements, &amp;
alſo of the Lordes prayer, and that in the Engliſh
tongue: I thought good, not to meddle any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that waye, ſeeing ſo good an entrance was
made vnto it: But neither ſeeing nor hearing of
any that had giuen forth any ſermons or lectures,
vpon the articles of our Chriſtian faith, a thing as
neceſſarie as the other, I was the more embolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to ſet this treatiſe forth, that the ſimple and
ignorant, which can but only reade, and haue this
benefite to profite themſelues withall, might haue
the true and playne meaning of euery article of
their faith, as they haue the expoſition of the
Lordes prayer, and ten Commandements. For if
this Creede, commonly called the Creede of the
Apoſtles, ſhall onely be ſayde without booke, and
rehearſed of the people, without the meaning of
it in more words: then they can not take ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb facs="tcp:10917:3"/>
out of theſe articles as were requiſite, becauſe
they do not vnderſtande them. And ſo great and
excellent myſteries lying hid, ſhal do no good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are not opened and reuealed to the
ſimpler ſort. The cauſe that moued me to preſent
theſe my firſt fruits vnto your Honour, was, That
partly you had heard them read vnto you, &amp; your
Honors accepting of them as fauoring the trueth
ſhall incourage others to doe the like, and reade
them more diligently. I haue not laboured to be
curious in this matter, but ſo plaine as the weakeſt
of capacitie might eaſely vnderſtande: for whoſe
ſake, and not for the learned I was willing to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
this worke, according to that talent that the
Lorde in mercy hath committed vnto me his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
for the building vp of his ſpirituall temple. I
doubt not, but by the working of Gods holy ſpirit
in you in reading of theſe articles nowe and then,
your Honour, (being voyde of waightier matters
and affayres, when leaſure ſhall ſerue,) you ſhall
finde ſome comfort and conſolation in them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be playne, yet are they true, &amp; neede
no eloquence to ſet them forth: for trueth ſeeketh
no corners to hide her ſelfe in: Onely her feare is
leaſt ſhe ſhould be hid. I graunt, it might ſeeme a
needleſſe and fruitleſſe thing to write bookes and
publiſhe them in theſe dayes, wherein are ſuch
ſtore that nowe bookes lacke readers, rather then
readers want bookes: but if a man conſider well
with him ſelfe, he ſhall finde that a great many of
them tende not ſo much to ſet forth godlines, as
wantonnes: neither do they profit the Church and
common wealth, but rather hurt and hinder it as
much as in them lyeth, ſo that it had bene better
<pb facs="tcp:10917:3"/>
that a great many of them had bene ſuppreſſed
and neuer bene written. They hurt many, for they
leade yong men, (vnleſſe Gods ſpirit guide them
the better) to vtter deſtruction. Theſe are not the
bookes that teach young men, which are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
wanton and wilde, and giuen to luſtes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine
from libertie of the fleſh: but rather giue
them the bridle to theſe wanton luſtes and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites:
and pitie it is they ſhould bee ſuffered in a
Chriſtian co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. Theſe idle bookes teach
not a man to amende and correct his wayes, but
vtterly to peruert them. A young man therefore
ſhall clenſe his wayes, not by theſe meanes, but by
ruling himſelf according to the word of the Lord,
as the Prophet Dauid hath forewarned, Pſal. 119.
ſo then although the ſtore of bookes in our dayes
is great, yet the number of them that encreaſe
true godlineſſe, is not ſo great, but that it may be
augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. And albeit ſome one booke pleaſe not
euery man, yet another may, ſeeing there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
and diuers giftes giuen to edifie, that all men
may be without excuſe before the Lorde. If any
find fault and ſay, This writer is too hard and hye
for my capacity, he may haue an eaſier: if this
man bee too eloquent and fine, he may haue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that is more ſimple and playne: for God be
thanked, there is great varietye of giftes in the
Church of Chriſt: and as it is in the body naturall
of men that al members are not alike, nor haue
the ſame function, yet all are neceſſary: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the foote be not ſo excellent a member as
the hand or the eye, yet for the vſe of the body, it
is as neceſſary &amp; profitable: neither can the head
ſay to the foote, I haue no neede of thee, but one
<pb facs="tcp:10917:4"/>
hath neede of the helpe of another for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole: So it is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> myſtical body of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Church, ſome haue more excellent giftes then
others, and ſome may be likened to the head, ſome
to the eye, and ſome to the hand: other of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
giftes to the foote and to the legge which yet
ſurely can not be deſpiſed or lightly ſet by, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the body can not want them: neither is
this onely to be ſeene in the myſticall body of
the Church, wherein ſome are paſtors, ſome doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
ſome Deacons, and ſome haue the gift of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
ſome of knowledge, ſome of vtterance,
&amp; ſome of tongues: But this may be perceiued in
the body of the common wealth, wherein ſome
are kinges and rulers, appoynted of God to bee
heades ouer others, and ſome are crafteſmen, and
artificers, ſome huſbandmen and plowmen farre
inferiour to the other, and yet notwithſtanding, as
neceſſary is the poore labouring man for the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
body, as is the magiſtrate and ſuperiour: for if
all ſhould rule, who ſhoulde obey: if all againe
ſhould obey, who ſhould rule or gouerne? but nowe
the Lorde hath ſo tempered and diſpoſed theſe
thinges in his infinite wiſedome, that there ſhould
be no diſorder, and that euery one ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detted
and bounde to another: that ſo, loue and
vnity might be kept and maynteyned in al. For no
one man hath all giftes giuen vnto him, that hee
might ſtande in neede of his neighbour, and loue
him the better, hauing that gift which hee ſeeth
him ſelfe to be deſtitute of. Thus, being willing
to performe all the duties of a faithfull miniſter
of Ieſus Chriſt vnto your honour, I leaue to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

briefly the meaning of al the
articles of our Chriſtian
fayth, which are neceſſary

purpoſe, that as thou haſt in Engliſh an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

God and the Lordes prayer, to knowe
the better what they meane: ſo thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

open booke ſhalbe as ſealed vnto men, except
the ſpirit reueale it vnto them, which he will
doe, no doubt, if thou ſeeke it by humble and
earneſt prayer to God, in his ſonnes name. For
ſurely this is the cauſe, why many reading the
Scriptures vnderſtand them not, becauſe they
come to them with vnprepared heartes, not
ſubdued with humilitie, but preſuming with
their naturall witte, to vnderſtand the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in them conteined. But fleſh &amp; blood doth
not reueale theſe ſecret and hid thinges vnto

them, other ſome reade them but to
diſpute, and talke of them with the learned,
and not to amende their liues, being detected
by them, but onely to knowe them, and let the
practiſe goe. But theſe men ſo doing, can not
be bleſſed Luke 11. cap. Wherfore dearely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
Chriſtian, I exhort thee to reade the

of the meaning of theſe
wordes, it ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider in a word
or two, who made this
Chriſtian order and forme
of our beliefe. The generall and common
opinion receaued with the whole conſent of
the Church, is, that the xii. Apoſtles of our
ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, made this Creede, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one an article, as a godly writer of our
time, one <hi>Aretius</hi> in his booke of queſtions
doeth ſhew. Therefore it is called the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
Creede. But whether it were they or
no that made it, or any other, it is no great
matter, ſeeing it is all the vndoubted trueth
of Gods worde, &amp; euery poynt of it agreeth
with the reſt of the holy ſcriptures written
with the Spirit of Chriſt. We haue many
bookes in the olde &amp; new Teſtament, which
are written for our conſolation &amp; comfort,
and that by the finger of God, but yet we
knowe not the names of thoſe men that
<pb facs="tcp:10917:8"/>
wrote them, as the booke of the Iudges, the
booke of Kinges, and the Chronicles, and
ſuch like: and in the newe Teſtament the
Epiſtle to the Ebrewes. Theſe all are the
holy worde of God, but yet we knowe not
the authors of them. And it ſeemeth that the
holy Ghoſt woulde haue their names ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
and vnknowen, becauſe we ſhoulde
receiue all Scripture alike, and with the
ſame authoritie which proceedeth from the
mouth of God, making no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
or choyſe of men, when all is trueth
that is written, and that we ſhoulde not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
ſo much, who ſpeaketh or writeth a
thing, as what is ſpoken &amp; written vnto vs.
Thus much for the writers of this worke.
Nowe let vs conſider the thing it ſelfe.
This Creede hath foure partes, the firſt
is of our faith, &amp; beliefe in God the Father,
the firſt perſon in Trinitie: the ſeconde is
of our truſt and beliefe in God the Sonne
Ieſus Chriſt our ſauiour, the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in Trinitie: the third is of our faith in
the holy Ghoſt, the power of God, which
is the thirde perſon in Trinitie: the fourth
and laſt parte is of the holy and Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
Church of Chriſt, and of thoſe things
that are to be beleued concerning the ſame,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:8"/>
which are contayned in the laſt three arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which are annexed and ioyned vnto the
Church, as <hi>The remiſſion of ſinnes, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of the bodie, and the life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi>
Theſe are the benefites which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
the Church. This is the diuiſion of
the Creede. Out of the firſt article we haue
to note theſe two things: firſt that we muſt
beleeue in God: ſecondly, what maner of
God it is, in whome we doe beleeue. The
meaning of theſe wordes is this, I the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
and childe of God, I, I ſay, &amp; not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for me, doe beleeue, hope and truſt in
one almightie, eternall &amp; euerliuing God,
which is not only a God of might vnto me,
to be able to do all thinges, but a moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
father in Ieſus Chriſt, moſt willing
and ready to helpe me in al troubles and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities
of this life, when I ſhall cry &amp; call
vnto him. Firſt therefore we learne here to
beleeue &amp; truſt in God only, and not in any
creature whatſoeuer, for they cannot helpe
vs, as Dauid ſayeth in his Pſalmes, <hi>Vaine
is the helpe of man. It is thou that ſaueſt
me from mine aduerſaries.</hi> And here note,
that there is a great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene theſe
three, to beleeue God, &amp; to beleeue there is a
God, &amp; to beleeue in God, the deuils beleue
<pb facs="tcp:10917:9"/>
the firſt &amp; the ſecond, that God is true of his
word and promiſe, which is, to beleeue God,
&amp; they alſo beleeue there is one God and no
moe, and tremble, as S. Iames the Apoſtle
ſayth, Chap. 2. 19. but they beleeue not the
third, that is, in God, which is as much as to
embrace &amp; acknowledge him for our good
God, and to ſticke to him, and to his worde
only. This is proper to the Elect &amp; children
of God, not to the deuils and reprobates,
which doe not truſt in him. For they lacke a
true iuſtifying faith, which is defined to be
a ſure truſt in the mercies of God &amp; his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
made vnto vs in Ieſus Chriſt his
Sonne, (by whom he hath adopted vs) that
he wil be mercifull vnto vs, &amp; forgiue vs all
our ſinnes. This is faith, &amp; this is it that we
muſt haue, when we ſay, <hi>I beleeue in God.</hi>
For faith muſt looke vnto God, &amp; not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man or angel, or ſaint in heauen. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Paul ſaid to the iayler, aſking howe he
might be ſaued, when he had abuſed &amp; cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
handled the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Actes 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Beleeue,</hi> ſaieth he,
<hi>in the Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt
be ſaued.</hi> Surely he could not haue ſayde,
Beleeue in Chriſt, vnleſſe he had bene very
God: and marke howe he ſayeth not, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
Ieſus Chriſt, but, Beleeue in the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:9"/>
Lord Ieſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaued, as it is
ſayde here in our Creede, I beleeue in
God. This that we muſt beleeue in God, is
warranted by our ſauiour Chriſt, ſaying to
his diſciples, <hi>Beleeue in God, let not your
heartes be troubled, Iohn</hi> 14. So that this
doctrine to beleeue in God &amp; in no other, is
a doctrine of comfort to al the godly, and to
ſettle their hearts that they be not troubled
or caried away with vaine perſuaſions of
men and of Angels, which Paul forbiddeth,
<hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. But here may a queſtion be made,
why we ſay not, as in the Lordes prayer in
the plurall number, Our Father, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
vs our treſpaſſes: ſo here alſo in like
ſort, why ſay we not, We beleeue in God?
Firſt I anſwere, that is a prayer to God, &amp;
this is a confeſſion of our faith. Then I ſay
the caſe is not all one or alike. For I may
pray for another man,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> and am commanded
ſo to doe, becauſe we are al members of the
ſame body of Chriſt, ſo that my prayer may
helpe and profit him. But I can not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
for another man, neither ſhal my faith
and beliefe profit another man, except he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
him ſelfe the promiſes of Chriſt: for
euery man ſhall be ſaued by his owne faith,
as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet Habakuk ſaith, <hi>Chap. 2. The
<pb facs="tcp:10917:10"/>
iuſt man ſhal liue by his own faith.</hi> And this
notably confoundeth &amp; reproueth that fond
and falſe opinion of the papiſtes, which ſay
that it is inough to beleeue generally as the
church beleeueth, not knowing how or what
to beleeue. This ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce alſo reproueth and
conuinceth another hereſie of theirs which
ſay, that a man may be iuſtified by his owne
works. Here it is ſayd, The iuſt ſhall liue by
his faith, and not by his good workes or
deedes. And when Habacuk ſaith, his faith,
he meaneth not that faith is of our ſelues,
but that faith which doth ſaue vs, is within
vs in our hearts, &amp; not without vs in other
men, meaning neuertheleſſe, that faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
from God aboue, and not of vs. As
Iames chap. 1. And this doth teach vs to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the mercies of God vnto our ſelues, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I beleeue as well as other men, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God
wil help me, &amp; be my father. This is a great
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort which the godly only haue, and not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
wicked, as Dauid ſaith, The Lorde is his
Lorde as wel as he is a lord to other. Thus
much on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we muſt beleeue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, in God
only. Now ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly conſider w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your ſelues
in what maner of god you doe beleeue and
truſt: not in ſuch a one as the Paynims did,
that could not help them, as Iupiter, Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:10"/>
Diana and ſuch like, which did appoint
a multitude of them to gouerne and guyde
the worlde, becauſe they thought that one
was not able ynough of himſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made one for heauen, as Iupiter, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the ſea, as Neptune. One for hell
as Pluto. One for the fire as Vulcan. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are wee taught here to beleeue in ſuch
a god as the wicked Iſraelites did, called
Baal, which could not heare them when
they cryed vnto him, as it is in the booke of
the Kings, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Elias reproueth, 3. <hi>Kings.
18. Chap.</hi> Of ſuch Idols and gods the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Dauid ſpeaketh, and derideth them &amp;
their worſhippers, <hi>Pſal. 115. Saying, they
haue mouthes and ſpeake not, eares and
heare not, eyes &amp; ſee not, noſes and ſmell
not, hands and handle not, feete and walke
not, neither make they a ſound with their
throte.</hi> Neither haue we ſuch pety gods of
ſtone and wood, as the papiſts haue their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.
But our God in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we do confeſſe
that we beleeue, is ſuch a one as is a father,
for his goodnes and mercie: and almightie,
for his ſtrength and power. This doth Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
meane, when hee doeth ſpeake of his
great God, and ſetteth him againſt al other
falſe gods of the idolaters, ſaying, <hi>as for
<pb facs="tcp:10917:11"/>
our God, he is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> As if he would ſay,
he is a moſt mightie God, and both what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
hee will, no man can hinder or let his
power. This as it is a great comfort to all
the godly, to haue ſuch a God to ayde them
at all neede, ſo it is a terror to the wicked
to conſider that they haue to doe with ſuch
a God as is omnipotent, able to beate them
to peeces and powder, when they reſiſt him.
As hee did mightily deſtroy Pharao, ſo did
hee wonderfully deliuer his people and
children the Iſraelites out of his handes,
from the read ſea. So he declared him ſelfe
an omnipotent father. We ſee then here as
in other places, how God ioyneth his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and iuſtice to terrifie, and alſo his mercie
and clemency to comfort. I ſay they are put
both together, euen to terrifie the godly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould not commit ſinne, but feare
to offende ſuch a mightie Father. So it is
ſaid in the beginning of our prayer, Our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to comfort vs, but it is ſaid alſo, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
to magnifie his power &amp; greatnes ouer
al things. Likewiſe in the giuing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Law
it is ſaide, Heare O Iſrael, I am y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde,
great &amp; terrible, no doubt, to put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mind
to feare him reuerently, and not to preſume
vpon him. But yet he addeth comfort after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:11"/>
ſaying, Thy God, to deliuer thee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
which hath bene thy God already.
Thus we ſee that both muſt goe together,
Gods iuſtice, and Gods mercie, as Dauid
ſaid, <hi>Thy rod &amp; thy ſtaffe, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort me,
Pſal.</hi> 23. Wee call him father, not in reſpect
of our creation, for ſo he is our Maker and
Creator: neither in reſpect of our gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for ſo he is our Lord and maſter: and
thoſe names are not ſo comfortable vnto vs,
becauſe hee is ſo, that is, a Lord and maker,
euen to the wicked and reprobate. But wee
call him father, firſt in reſpect of Chriſt,
which is his onely begotten and beloued
ſonne: Then in that we are his children ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opted
in Chriſt our elder brother, which hath
made vs all ſonnes and children to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
father, by his death and paſſion, by his
obedience, by his fulfilling of the lawe, and
by his ſatiſfaction for our ſinnes, as Iohn
ſaith, <hi>Chap. 3. Behold what loue the father
hath ſhewed vnto vs, that we ſhould bee
called the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of God.</hi> This is a maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
comfort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the God of the whole earth,
the Lord of lords, is a louing father vnto vs.
And this is in Chriſt Ieſus, that wee haue
this dignity &amp; prerogatiue aboue others, not
in our ſelues, nor by birth and nature, for ſo
<pb facs="tcp:10917:12"/>
we are the ſonnes of Gods ire &amp; wrath, of
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe of our ſinful father Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
tranſgreſſing Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we
name him almighty, we do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue him
to haue ſuch a power which he doth not vſe,
but in ſaying this, we confeſſe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath al things &amp; creatures vnder
his power &amp; obedience, euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
as we ſee in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel, how they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to Chriſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of God,
&amp; how he aſked leaue, before he could do any
thing to Iob, <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. Again, we muſt needes
grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that being omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and almighty,
he doth all things that are done, he ruleth &amp;
gouerneth heauen &amp; earth, the ſea and hel,
&amp; all things in them, the whole world at his
beck doth bend &amp; yeld it ſelf. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our God
being ſo mighty, is not an idle God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked do imagine, but diſpoſeth
al things by his iuſt &amp; wiſe prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
they fal out: nothing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out his wil and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, no not the flight of
Sparrowes. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. For if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord ſhould
not vphold heauen and earth, yea the whole
world w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his power, it would fal to nothing,
to duſt &amp; aſhes: therefore it is ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt
doth ſuſteine all things by the worde of his
might, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. And here our faith hath a
<pb facs="tcp:10917:12"/>
double co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prouidence &amp; omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of God. Firſt becauſe it conſidereth, that
God hath ſufficient power to defende his
Church. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, becauſe he is willling to
do it. It foloweth, <hi>maker of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth.</hi>
This proueth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is almighty, becauſe he
hath made heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth of nothing, when it
was not, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. And this doth notably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
the wicked &amp; falſe opinions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
as Plato &amp; Ariſtotle, who greatly
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> derogation &amp; impairing of Gods glory
&amp; power, thought &amp; held that the world was
eternal fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginnings, and neuer made,
neither ſhould haue ende. But this is falſe &amp;
blaſphemous againſt God. We learne here
another leſſon in our faith, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world was
made and had a beginning, and ſhall haue an
ending, as Moſes proueth the one, &amp; Peter
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, 2. <hi>Epiſt. 3. Chap.</hi> Now by making
of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and earth, we vnderſtand al things
conteined in heauen &amp; earth, as the ſea. For
Dauid ſaith, <hi>The ſea is his, and he made it,
95. Pſa.</hi> The things in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as his angels,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things in earth, men, beaſts, fiſhes, foules,
worms, &amp; al other ſenſles creatures whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.
It is therfore, as if we ſhould ſay, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of al things, viſible which we ſee, &amp; inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
which we ſee not, as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Creed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
<pb facs="tcp:10917:13"/>
of Nice in more fully expreſſed. And
this was done, becauſe of the Heretikes
called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maniches, which did appoynt two
beginnings of things created, the one good,
which was God, and him they made the
beginner of all good thinges, the other they
imagined to be ill, which was the deuil, and
him they ſet ouer the euill things, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
him the maker of them. But theſe
men were deceiued, which thought any ill
thing to be created and made ill at the firſt,
for the ſcripture doth otherwiſe pronounce
of al things, that they were exceeding good.
Geneſ. 1. But in that any thing is ill, it is
by deprauation and corruption, by the ſinne
of man, of Adam, and not by creation: for
the deuill was made an Angel, but he fell
and loſt his firſt eſtate, and ſo became a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
and wicked ſpirit by his owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and will, as Peter proueth. 2. Epiſtle
2. Chap. Nowe if the deuill made ſome
things, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God made not al: but what ſaith
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture? <hi>The Lord hath made al things
for his owne ſake:</hi> he ſaith not ſome things,
but al: nay he goeth further, &amp; addeth, <hi>euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
wicked for the day of euil.</hi> not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he created
them wicked: for hee made them in Adam
perfit and good: but he hath appointed them
<pb facs="tcp:10917:13"/>
to ſerue to his honour and glory: although
they bee veſſels of wrath, he is glorified in
them after a ſort, although not ſo as hee
is glorified in the good. For therefore dyd
he ſturre vp Pharao King of Egypt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he woulde ſhewe his glory vpon him,
Rom. 9. Seeing then God hath made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
he hath made alſo all the ornaments of
heauen: as the heauenly ſpirits, the Sunne,
the Moone, the Starres to gouerne the
earth by their light. For in that we giue
him the creation of the greater, wee muſt
needes graunt the leſſer, and hee that can
make the great and huge heauens of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
is able alſo to make the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
in them of leſſe importance. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Angels, it is ſufficient for vs to
know, that they were all made of the Lorde
for his wil and pleaſure, to be his miniſtring
Spirites, to execute his commandementes
and iudgements againſt the wicked, and for
to ſerue for thoſe that ſhalbe heires of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Hebr. 1. It is but curioſitie to enquire
of the time of the creation, or of the orders
and eſtate in heauen. Moſes telleth vs a
good and ſhort leſſon, that heauen and earth
were made perfect in ſixe dayes, with al the
hoſtes and furniture of them, and ſaieth no
<pb facs="tcp:10917:14"/>
more of this matter, to teache vs ſobrietie
in theſe things, to wade no farther then we
haue the warrant of the worde to beare vs
out. Seeing all other vaine queſtions are
condemned of the Apoſtle Saint Paul,
Titus 3. The like is to be vnderſtoode in
making of the earth, to comprehende all
things in the earth, whatſoeuer I doe ſee,
heare, and vnderſtande. By the creation of
theſe thinges celeſtiall, and terreſtiall, I
doe conſider with my ſelfe theſe foure moſt
excellent and diuine vertues in God, which
comprehende all the reſt in them, and to
the which they may bee referred. Firſt by
the great and wonderfull creation of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall
worlde, I learne to come to the
conſideration of his vnſpeakeable power
and greatneſſe,<note place="margin">Potentia Dei.</note> that he was able without
and payne or labour at all, yea with great
eaſe and pleaſure, to create heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and earth,
with his onely worde, as the Prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
ſayeth, <hi>He ſpake the worde, and it was
done.</hi> O what a great God is this, to be
feared ouer all the earth, for his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
greatneſſe and Maieſtie! This doeth
put vs in minde what a mighty God we do
ſerue, that wee may from our heart feare
him. The ſeconde thing to be conſidered in
<pb facs="tcp:10917:14"/>
this creation generall,<note place="margin">Sapientia Dei.</note> is his infinite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable
wiſedome, in diſpoſing ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and placing ſo ſeemely all thinges in
their place and degree, as it is moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
to beholde, with ſuch beautie and
proportion in euery creature, that vnleſſe
we be too too blockiſhe, we muſt crye out
with Dauid and ſay, and confeſſe, <hi>O Lord,
howe wonderfull are thy workes: in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
haſt thou made them all.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
<hi>Great is our Lorde, great is his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
yea his wiſdome is infinite.</hi> To ſee the
goodly order of heauen, it will make a man
to be aſtonied at the wiſedome of his God,
more then the Queene of Saba was, when
ſhee came to ſee, and heare the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Solomon. For <hi>this wiſedome
by whome all thinges were made, is the
Sonne of GOD Ieſus Chriſt, the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of his Father, Iohn 1. Hebr.</hi> 1. And
here we learne of this wiſedome, which he
hath vſed and ſhewed in the creation, a good
leſſon for our comfort, that as the Lorde
is almightie, and able to deliuer vs his
children, and Church from the wicked:
ſo doeth hee knowe the wayes and meanes
moſt perfitly and readily howe to doe it at
all times. For his knowledge paſſeth our
<pb facs="tcp:10917:15"/>
vnderſtanding farre. Therfore Peter ſaid,
<hi>The Lorde knoweth howe to deliuer the
godly out of tentation and trouble, and to
puniſh the wicked. 2. Pet.</hi> 2. So that when
man can finde no way, no deuice or meane
how to ſhift him ſelf out of daunger, yet the
Lord by his wiſedome and knowledge hath
diuers wayes to helpe. Diuers examples of
this are in the holy Scriptures: when Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and the Iſraelites were ſo entangled
and compaſſed about, that there ſeemed no
way for them to eſcape, ſo that Moſes
prayed to the Lorde moſt earneſtly to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
them, for he him ſelfe ſawe no meanes
howe to doe it, being on euery ſide on the
ryght hande and on the left, compaſſed in
with the hie hilles, before them was the
great redde ſea, behind them was the huge
hoſt of Pharao, ſo that nowe all hope of
life and ſuccour was taken away: then the
Lorde founde a way in the middeſt of the
ſea, to deliuer his people, and to drowne
his enemies: ſo he declared his wiſedome in
preſeruing them ſo miraculouſly. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
when the virgin Marie dyd not ſee
howe ſhe ſhoulde conceyue and bring foorth
a ſonne being a mayde, and not knowing
any man, and therefore ſayde to the angel,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:15"/>
Howe ſhall this come to paſſe, ſo ſtrange
and rare a matter? the Lorde founde a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
way howe he brought it to paſſe, that ſhe
conceiued by the operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy ghoſt.
This made Solomon in his Prouerbs, to
ſay, Chapter 21. <hi>There is no wiſedome,
there is no vnderſtanding, there is no cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
againſt the Lord.</hi> For he ouerthroweth
the ſubtill fetches of the wiſedome of this
worlde, as of Ieroboam in his politike
counſel to make calues, &amp; of Achitophel in
his wilie practiſes. The Phariſees in their
ſnare that they had layde for our Sauiour
Chriſt, were taken them ſelues, to their
ſhame and reproche. Thus the Lorde ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
abroade the deuiſes of the wicked
kings and princes of this worlde, by his
wiſedome, for theirs is fooliſhneſſe to his,
1. Cor. 3. Saint Paul is rauiſhed with the
conſideration of this great wiſedome, and
cryeth out, ſaying, <hi>O the depth of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
&amp; wiſdome, and knowledge of God,
howe vnſercheable are his iudgements, &amp;
his wayes paſt finding our. Rom.</hi> 11. Wee
muſt then applie theſe things to our ſelues,
to receiue comfort and conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by them.
When we looke vp into heauen, &amp; downe
in the earth, or in the ſea, let vs thinke vpon
<pb facs="tcp:10917:16"/>
the wiſedome of the Lorde and glorifie him
in it, and ſay, O Lorde, howe wiſe art thou
in all thy doings, howe great is thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
vnto me: ſuch knowledge is too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
for me, it paſſeth my reache and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
So ſaide Dauid, ſaye vnto God,
<hi>O how wonderful art thou in thy workes!</hi>
Unleſſe we doe this, we are vnthankefull
beholders of Gods wiſedome, if we praiſe
him not for it. We may ſee it in our owne
ſelues, and in others euery day, in our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of our body and ſoule, howe wiſe and
wonderfull hee is. Theſe thinges we muſt
meditate vpon dayly and thinke, otherwiſe
we are no better then bruite beaſtes, which
ſee them onely and beholde them, but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
nothing in them. Here we learne our
duetie to our good God.</p>
                  <p>3 Thirdly in the creation of the worlde<note place="margin">Bonitas Dei.</note>
we beholde as it were in a glaſſe, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of God, his mercie towarde all men,
but eſpecially to the elect and choſen, that
for them, and their ſakes, he hath created
theſe things, and doeth dayly preſerue by
his prouidence euerye one of them, ſo that
hee hath not made them for him ſelfe, I
meane, that hee needed not any of them,
being all ſufficient in him ſelfe, moſt
<pb facs="tcp:10917:16"/>
happie and bleſſed, which is meant by his
name <hi>Shaddai,</hi> which ſignifieth that hee
is ſufficient of his owne nature. So that
a true Chriſtian man may ſay that his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Father hath made all thinges for his
vſe and benefite, heauen one daye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
him, the earth to maynteyne him, all
creatures to ſerue him, the Sunne, Moone
&amp; Starres to lyght him, liuing creatures
to feede him and to recreate him, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
to keepe and to preſerue him in his
wayes, by his Fatherly appoyntment. O
what great benefites are here, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
of our mercifull Father by his creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all things! Here we learne our duetie
to be thankful to God for them, in the name
of Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, to vſe theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
to his honour and glorie, to the profit
and commodity of his Church, and our
brethren here with vs. And here I ſee by
Gods goodneſſe and mercie towarde me,
that hee hath not onely created theſe things
at the firſt, but he doeth preſerue them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
houre by his power: otherwiſe they
woulde vaniſhe away and come to nothing,
as Dauid ſayeth, <hi>If thou take away thy
breath from them,</hi> That is, his power
from his creatures, <hi>they dye.</hi> So that
<pb facs="tcp:10917:17"/>
here we ſee Gods prouidence ouer vs, and
all things. For he woorketh dayly by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing
and keeping his creatures in their
eſtate, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>My Father hitherto
woorketh, and I woorke,</hi> by maynteyning
things created. For God is not like a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter
that maketh an houſe, and ſetteth it
vp in deede, but afterwarde neuer perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
ſeeth it againe, but leaueth it to the
dweller and owner of it, the maſter thereof,
and careth no more for it. If God ſhoulde
deale ſo with vs, it woulde be ill and wrong
with vs: for the deuill woulde dayly deſtroy
vs, if he did not keepe vs and all ours. For
we are not able to keepe our ſelues, no not
a minute of an houre. Here therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
in the mercie of God, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
care and prouidence ouer vs and all
his creatures.</p>
                  <p>4 The laſt thing we learne of the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the worlde, is the iuſtice of God, how
he gouerneth it rightly in equitie &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the Prophet ſingeth, <hi>All the waies
of the Lord are iudgement &amp; equite.</hi> For
vnleſſe hee dyd execute his iuſtice vpon the
wicked, they woulde deſtroy his Church:
but he keepeth them vnder, as it were with
a bridle, and hampereth euen the proude
<pb facs="tcp:10917:17"/>
tyrants and deuils of hell, by his ſeuere iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
ſhewed vpon them. So that the Lorde
is iuſt in all his wayes, yea his wil is a moſt
perfite rule and patterne of iuſtice. Dauid
often repeateth this leſſon, to terrifie the
wicked, <hi>Iuſt art thou, O Lorde, &amp; right are
thy iudgements, Pſalm.</hi> 119. So ſayde the
Emperor Mauricius, being killed by Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas.
This do the wicked confeſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues,
when they feele his heauy hand vpon them
for their ſinnes and offences, as Pharao did
when the hayle deſtroyed the cattell of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
ſaying vnto Moſes &amp; Aaron, I haue
nowe ſinned, the Lorde is righteous, but I
and my people are wicked, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. Thus
the reprobate, whether they will or no, muſt
confeſſe the Lorde to be righteous in his
workes. For as the Lord is merciful to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
the ſinnes of his children that are true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
penitent, and not obſtinate: ſo is he alſo
a moſt iuſt Iudge ouer all the earth, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his ſharpe puniſhments vpon the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
and wilful ſinners. The Iudge of the
worlde doeth according to iuſtice, as Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
ſayde of him, when he was about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
Sodoma, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. I delite, ſayth the
Lorde, in iuſtice, mercy, and iudgement,
<hi>Ierem.</hi> 9. Examples of his iuſtice he hath
<pb facs="tcp:10917:18"/>
ſhewed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flood brought in vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
Example of his mercie, in ſauing Noe
and his familie: ſo that his iuſtice and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
goeth alwaies together, as Dauid ſaith,
<hi>I will ſing of mercie and iudgement, Pſal.</hi>
101. repreſenting the perſon of Chriſt,
which ſhould be in his kingdom, as wel iuſt
as mercifull: a Lion of the tribe of Iuda, to
teare in pieces the wicked, and a Lambe to
preſerue his with al gentleneſſe &amp; ſoftneſſe.
Looke vpon Sodome, how the Lord ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there his extreme and ſeuere Iuſtice vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thoſe miſcreants, to conſume them with fire
and brimſtone from heauen moſt terribly,
<hi>Gen. 19. and</hi> as Peter ſayeth, <hi>Made them
an example for all ages and poſterities to
come, of his iuſtice againſt ſinne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes,
2. Pet.</hi> 2. But yet then hee deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
iuſt Lot out of tentation and trouble.
Note his mercy in it, to the good &amp; godly.
I might heere recken vp the examples of
Sennacherib, of Achab, of Nabuchodono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor,
of Herode, of Iulian, and ſuch other
perſecuting kings and Emperours againſt
the Church of Chriſt: whome all God in
his iuſtice hath ouerthrowen and vtterly
deſtroyed. This we learne, that God doeth
alſo preſerue the ſtate of mankinde by his
<pb facs="tcp:10917:18"/>
iuſtice, that one doeth not ouerrunne ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as wilde beaſtes. Then by this wee
learne to ſtand in feare of Gods iuſtice, if
we ſinne at any tyme deſperately, leaſt we
be caught vp with it, and ſuddenly conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<hi>If his wrath be kindled, yea but a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
bleſſed are al they that put their truſt
in him, Pſalme 2. For our God in his
wrath and iuſtice is a conſuming fire,</hi> as
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. And it is an horrible thing, to
fall into his handes. If he be angry, who
may abide or ſtande in his ſight, when the
hilles melte away, and the ſea is dried vp,
and the hard rockes cleaue aſunder? O that
we had this conſideration of his iuſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes continually, it would keepe
vs from all ſinne and vngodlines: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſinne, becauſe wee feare not this
iuſtice of the Lordes. <hi>There is no feare
of god</hi> (ſayeth Dauid of the wicked)
<hi>before their eyes,</hi> therefore they ſinne.
We ſee then what wee haue to note vpon
this article of our Chriſtian beliefe, and
what commodity commeth vnto vs of the
creation of all thinges by God, howe we
gather and conſider of his infinite great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
by his wonderfull woorkes: for
the heauens declare the glory of God,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:19"/>
and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firmament ſheweth his handy worke.
And this is one way to come to God, as to
be without excuſe before his tribunall ſeate
in the day of iudgement, when the ſecretes
of all heartes ſhall be diſcloſed, and all
thoughts opened before the Lorde. By this
creation the heathen men are without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
and haue knowen him generally, as
Paul ſayeth, Romanes the firſt chap. That
which may be knowen of God, is manifeſt
in them, for God hath ſhewed it vnto them.
For the inuiſible things of him, that is, his
eternall power and Godhead, are ſeene by
the creation of the worlde, being conſidered
in his workes, to the intent, that they ſhould
be without excuſe, becauſe that when they
knew God, they glorified him not as God,
neyther were thankefull, but became vayne
in their imaginations, &amp; their fooliſh heart
was full of darkneſſe: when they profeſſed
themſelues to be wiſe, they became fooles.
God is knowen three wayes, by his works,<note place="margin">God is kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen three wayes.</note>
by his worde, and by his holy ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Although God be knowen by all theſe
wayes of his elect, yet he is knowen of the
reprobate onely by his worde and workes,
which ſee the workes, and heare his worde,
but neuer haue his Spirite directing them
<pb facs="tcp:10917:19"/>
aright, which is proper onely to his owne
children. Of the firſt way ſpeaketh Paul in
this place, vnto the which the creation is a
glaſſe, to bring vs to a full conſideration of
his greatneſſe. Wel, we learne by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of heauen and earth, his power, his
wiſedome, his goodneſſe and iuſtice, and
whatſoeuer elſe may be in God. This is
great comfort to the godly, and bringeth
great boldeneſſe vnto them, and truſt in the
laſt day, that they haue ſuch a father, and do
beleeue in ſuch a God, as is maker of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and earth: this teacheth vs our duetie, to
referre all our actions to his honour and
glory, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe him alone, to acknowledge
that he made vs, and not we our lelues, to
liue to him, to dye to him, to do al things for
his ſake, that hath made all for vs, as good
ſeruantes ſhould be more carefull of their
maſters honour &amp; profite, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their own.
Nowe let vs giue thankes to ſuch a God,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath vouchſafed to giue vs faith to beleeue
in him, being ſo mightie a God, and we ſo
lowe and baſe children: ſo mercifull a father
vnto vs, notwithſtanding we are vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſonnes to him. And let vs praye vnto
him, to confirme this faith, and to encreaſe
it in vs euery day, till we come to a perfect
<pb facs="tcp:10917:20"/>
man in Ieſus Chriſt. Let vs deſire of him
to giue vs grace to behold this his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and diuine worke of his creation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hee hath ſhewed his wiſedome, power,
mercy, and iuſtice vnto al men, that we may
magnifie it (as it doth require) worthyly
with our heartes, and ſet forth his honour
and glory in theſe thinges, with thankes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
for all his benefites, ſeeing they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayne
vnto vs, our bodyes and ſoules,
which are fed and nouriſhed by them. This
grace and mercy let vs deſire him to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe
vnto vs, for his Chriſtes ſake our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
who hath dearly bought vs: to whom
with the holy ghoſt his infinit power, three
perſons and one euerliuing God, bee
rendred all power, prayſe, glory,
honour, and thankeſgiuing,

going before, the thinges, which
we haue to beleeue as concerning
God the father in his creation:
now followeth conſequently what we haue
to beleeue of God the ſonne, Ieſus Chriſt,
as concerning his incarnation and all the
benefites of his death and paſſion, which is
the ſecond part of the creede, as we deuided
it. And here in this article you muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
and repeate, as in the former, ſo in
this alſo: <hi>I beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> that is,
I truſt in him, and put my whole confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in him, that hee is my onely ſauiour,
and that God will for his ſake forgiue
me all my ſinnes. For it is not ſufficient to
beleeue in God the father, &amp; to know him,
vnleſſe we alſo beleeue in his only begotten
ſonne Ieſus Chriſte our Lorde, and knowe
him alſo. As Iohn repeating the wordes of
<pb facs="tcp:10917:21"/>
our ſauiour Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>This is life eternal
that they know thee to be the onely very
God, &amp; whom thou haſt ſent, Ieſus Chriſt.
Ioh.</hi> 17. So that our ſauiour Chriſt ioyneth
and matcheth in one, the knowledge of him
ſelfe with the knowledge of the father, as he
ſayeth alſo in another place, <hi>Except ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that I am he, ye ſhal die in your ſins.</hi>
We ſee then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if we muſt beleeue in Ieſus

creator, other wiſe it were idolatry to beleue
in any that is not God. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue

Iohns goſpel to his diſciples, <hi>Let not your
heart be troubled, beleeue ye in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
alſo in me.</hi> A notable place to prooue
this matter. Where we may alſo learne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
if we beleeue in God, our hearts ſhal not be
troubled, nor wauer hither &amp; thither, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
any place to reſt in. For therfore in our
miſeries &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers are we vexed &amp; troubled
out of meaſure, becauſe we put not our full
truſt in the father &amp; the ſonne. Nowe let vs
ſee with what titles our Chriſt is beautified
&amp; adorned with, for our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort &amp; conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
firſt of all, he is here called Ieſus, which
is an Ebrew word, &amp; ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in Engliſh as
<pb facs="tcp:10917:21"/>
much as Sauiour, which name the Angell
gaue vnto him (by Gods appoyntment) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was conceaued in the wombe of the
virgin Mary his mother. As we reade no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
ſet forth vnto vs in the firſt of Matth:
Shee ſhal bring foorth a ſonne, and cal his
name Ieſus, or ſauiour: for he ſhall ſaue
his people from their ſinnes and offences.
And for this cauſe he came into the worlde,
as he teſtifieth of him ſelf: The ſonne of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
came to ſaue that which is loſt, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
ſoules, but to ſaue, and to giue his life
a redemption for many, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. By this we
learne, that there is no other Sauiour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
for ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or earth, but
only Ieſus: and they that wil haue ſaluation
of God the father, muſt haue it onely at his
handes. Therefore doeth the ſcripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
of him, that there is no other name
giuen vnder heauen vnto men, wherein they
muſt be ſaued, but only in the name of <hi>Ieſus
Chriſt.</hi> For this is the ſtone which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the head ſtone, and the chiefe in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
neither is there any ſaluation in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Act.</hi> 4. We haue then to ſeek our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not in Angels, not in ſaints, not in men
or in our ſelues: but in him onely that hath
the key of Dauid, that ſhutteth heauen, and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:22"/>
no man openeth it, and openeth it, &amp; no man
ſhutteth. This is the firſt title of dignitie
and honour, that is giuen vnto him of his
father: the next is, that hee is called Chriſt,
which is a Greeke word, and ſignifieth in
Engliſh, Anoynted, which doth more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; effectually declare his office &amp; function
giuen him of the father for vs. For he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted
for three eſpeciall purpoſes: firſt to
bee our Prophet to teach vs, ſecondly, our
prieſt to offer him ſelfe a ſacrifice for vs, and
thirdly, our king to rule &amp; to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vs from
our enemies. Theſe things are al giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto
vs to vnderſtande in this name Chriſt. For
as al the Prophets, and prieſtes and kinges
in the time of the olde law, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Chriſt, were anoynted with oyle by
the commandement of God, as God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Elias</hi> to anoynt <hi>Eliſeus</hi> Prophet in his
ſtead, &amp; Moſes was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to anoynt
Aaron hye prieſt, and Samuel to anoynt
Saul &amp; Dauid to be kinges: ſo was Chriſt
alſo anoynted, not with oyle materiall as
they, but with ſpiritual oyle of gladneſſe, as
Dauid ſaieth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>aboue his fellowes,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, with
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt, aboue al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for he had it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
meaſure, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 34. So then, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
&amp; prieſts, &amp; kings were all figures, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:10917:22"/>
ſhadowes of Chriſt anoynted with oyle, to
ſignifie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they muſt be gentle, meeke, &amp; ſoft
to al their brethren: ſo it was alſo neceſſary,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt ſhould performe al this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
by him. And firſt we ſee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt toke
vpon him the office of a Prophet, to teach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
people his fathers wil, not thruſting in him
ſelfe as the falſe prophetes did, whom the
Lord ſent not at al, but being thereto lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
called &amp; authoriſed by his father from
heauen,<note place="margin">Luk 9. 35.</note> ſaying, <hi>Heare him,</hi> that is, to be our
doctour and teacher, our Prophete and
Scholemaſter. Being thus ordayned a
Prophet to teach vs, he executed his office
and calling moſt diligently, moſt paynfully
and faithfully: for he taught them in ſeaſon
and out of ſeaſon, earely and late, at home &amp;
abroad, by ſea and by land, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Euangeliſts
doe ſufficiently all of them record in their
goſpels, neither did he teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil of his
father publikely in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſynagogues only, but
priuately alſo in families &amp; houſes: as when
he was receiued into Marthas houſe, he ſate
&amp; taught there Mary &amp; others: whereby wee
that are the Lordes Prophets &amp; miniſters,
may learne by this good exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, howe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
&amp; readyly with al payne and diligence
to behaue our ſelues in the preaching of the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:23"/>
word of God his Goſpell, not to ceaſe at
any time, but to doe as he hath done before
vs. If then Chriſt be our Prophet (as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſayth of him, A Prophet ſhall the Lord
your God rayſe vp vnto you of your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
like vnto me: him ſhal you heare in al
thinges, that he ſhal ſpeake vnto you, <hi>Deut.</hi>
18.) we muſt heare him alone, &amp; not others
that teach falſe doctrine, as the papiſts: for
Chriſts ſheepe heare his voyce, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. We
learne againe, that no man beſide Chriſte,
was able to inſtruct vs in the will of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but hee alone, as Iohn ſayth, Chap. 1.
<hi>No man hath ſeene God at any time: the
only begotten ſon of God, which is in the
boſome of his father, he hath reuealed him
vnto vs.</hi> Againe, we vnderſtand that al men
by nature are ignorant of the will of God, &amp;
their dutie, becauſe we haue neede of Chriſt
to informe vs in the right way, to leade vs
in the trueth, leaſt we be deceued with lyes.
<hi>For of his fulneſſe haue wee all receiued,
Ioh.</hi> 1. Therefore is he called of Eſay, The
angel of great Counſell, and that the ſpirit
of the Lord ſhould reſt vpon him, the ſpirit
of wiſedome &amp; vnderſtanding, the ſpirit of
Counſel and ſtrength, the ſpirit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and of the feare of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:23"/>
This is a great comfort to vs, to haue ſuch
a teacher and Prophet giuen to vs, as is
made to vs of God, wiſedome. 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 1.
But the wicked can haue here no part at all
with him, for they do not heare his word and
voyce, neither wil they receiue his doctrine
&amp; inſtruction. Nowe we ſee how faithfully
Chriſt hath fulfilled this office of preaching,
as Marke ſayth of him, 1. Chap. Let vs goe
into the next Townes, that I may preache
there alſo, for I came out for that purpoſe.
The ende of this prophecie and teaching is,
that we ſhoulde bee made his diſciples and
ſchollers,<note place="margin">Chriſts prieſt hoode.</note> which God graunt vnto vs all. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
The ſecond office that is in Chriſt for
his Church, is his prieſthode: for after hee
had taught the people, (which thing he firſt
tooke in hand) hee ſealed his doctrine with
his owne blood, and offered vp him ſelfe
a ſacrifice moſt perfect, ſweete and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God his father, for vs al, to purge
vs from our ſinnes, to ſerue the liuing God.
For this alſo was the duetie of the prieſts in
the Leuitical lawe, that they ſhould offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
for the ſinnes of the people, &amp; pray
to God for them. This hath Chriſt fulfilled
by his death &amp; paſſion, which was ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
&amp; meritorious to take away ſinnes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:24"/>
father ſaith of him,<note place="margin">Pſal. 110. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
after the order of Melchieſedech.</hi> Of
this ſacrifice ſpeaketh abundantly the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to the Hebremes, but eſpecially in the
9. Chap.<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> ſaying, <hi>That Chriſt was once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to take away the ſinnes of many, and
to put away ſinne by the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>
And againe, that the blood of Chriſt,
which through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eternal ſpirit offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
without fault to God, ſhall purge our
conſciences from dead workes to ſerue the
liuing God, ſo that nowe he is become our
mediatour betweene God &amp; vs, &amp; doeth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the ſight of God for vs. This is a
great comfort for vs. But we ſee in this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
the vileneſſe &amp; greatneſſe of ſinne, &amp;
how lothſome &amp; deteſtable it was in Gods
ſight, that nothing in heauen or earth could
put it away or purge it, but the onely body
&amp; blood of Chriſt, this hie prieſt, moſt pure
and immaculate. This doth teach vs to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
ſinne, ſeeing Chriſt payed ſo dearely
for it. And this driueth vs to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider how we
are indebted to our good ſauiour Chriſt, for
dying ſo mercifully for vs: ſo that wee are
worſe then beaſts, vnleſſe we giue him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
thanks for it. Nothing could pacifie
Gods wrath conceiued againſt our ſinnes,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:24"/>
but only his deare ſonne, <hi>for in him he was
wel pleaſed, Matth.</hi> 3. So that nowe wee
which were ſometime farre off &amp; ſtrangers
from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth of Iſrael, are made
neere by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blod of Chriſt, to offer our ſelues
to him &amp; al ours, our prayers, our thanks, &amp;
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with boldneſſe, without feare, as Zachary
ſayth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. The third office y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we conſider
in him, is his ſpirituall &amp; euerlaſting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for ſpiritual it is, &amp; not carnal &amp; earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as he himſelf ſaid to Pilate, <hi>My kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is not of this world.</hi> And it is euerlaſting,
as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angel ſayde to Mary, <hi>He ſhal reigne
ouer the houſe of Iacob, &amp; of his kingdom
there ſhal be no end.</hi> So then he is a king,
as Zachary alſo ſayth, <hi>Behold, thy king co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vnto thee, meeke, O daughter Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
Chap. 9. This kingdom, he laſt of al
tooke vpon him, after that he had taught, and
offered vp him ſelfe, euen then when hee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
to ſit at the right hand of God: that
is, to haue all power and authority in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and earth. This kingdome doeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
chiefly in gouerning his electe, and his
Church by his holy ſpirite: for hee hath
gotten this kingdome for vs, becauſe hee
armeth vs with power to reſiſt ſinne, and
giueth vs of his princely treaſures &amp; gifts,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:25"/>
and wil at the laſt himſelfe lift vs vp thither,
and ſet vs with him in glory and honour, to
raine for euer &amp; euer, as he ſaith, It is your
fathers wil to giue you a kingdome, and he
that ouercommeth, ſhall ſit with mee in my
kingdome, as I haue ouercome, &amp; ſit with
my father in his kingdom. Reue. 3. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this kingdom of Chriſt doth beat downe
al force rayſed vp againſt his kingdome: as
the deuil, the Turke, the Pope, the wicked
ones of this world. Here he ſheweth himſelf
a mighty king ouer al the earth, to preſerue
his Church, hauing ſo many enemies. For
ſurely if he did not preſerue it, it would bee
ſwallowed vp euery houre, ſatan is ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to deſtroy it. What they haue don againſt
it, we ſee, but they could neuer preuaile: for
this is a comfortable ſaying,<note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> The gates of
hell ſhall not preuaile againſt it. Of this we
gather y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt ſhall euer haue his Church,
becauſe his power in his kingdom is infinit
to keep it: let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked rage neuer ſo much,
yet Chriſt is king of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole earth, yea the
world. Thus much for his kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,
<hi>his only ſonne.</hi> Here is declared vnto
vs, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ieſus Chriſt is the only ſonne of God,
&amp; therfore God, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame
nature w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father: for he is one w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his father.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:25"/>
This is the third title giuen to our ſauiour
Chriſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſonne of God:
but there may a queſtion bee inade, How is
Chriſt the only ſonne of God, ſeeing we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
are ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes as he is, as Iohn ſaith, <hi>As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as beleeue in Chriſt, he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> power
to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of God?</hi> To this we anſwere,
that Chriſt is the only ſonne of God by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
&amp; ſubſtance: and we by grace &amp; adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which before were not. For as when a
man hath no childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he maketh ſome by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option
and fauor, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he loueth, to enioy his
lands and inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ounting them as his
owne: ſo it is with God and vs. He hath no
moe ſonnes but one onely by nature &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
but by his loue and grace he maketh
vs his deare children by adoption in Chriſt:
for all is done for Chriſtes ſake our elder
brother, as Paul proueth, <hi>Ephe. 1. He hath
predeſtinated vs to be adopted for ſonnes
in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> For this then, that we are
ſonnes to ſo high &amp; great a God, a Lord and
king, ought we not to be very thankeful?
ought we not by all meanes to ſet forth his
honor &amp; glory more then our own? Surely
we ſhould do ſo: for how would I loue that
king here in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, or that Queene, or that
noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſhould make me a poore beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb facs="tcp:10917:26"/>
borne, his louing ſonne by adoption!
Now much more ought I to loue the ſonne
of God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath made me ſonne to his father
by his death &amp; ſatiſfaction. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt
is called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only begotten ſonne of God, we
muſt not imagine a carnall or groſſe beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
as is here among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but a diuine and
heauenly, incomprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible and vnſpeakable
to our capacity, before al beginnings, moſt
myſtical &amp; ſecret. The laſt title y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
Chriſt here, is the dignity &amp; honor of a Lord.
We cal him our Lord, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by right: for his
we are who hath bought vs, &amp; redeemed vs
by his owne body from the deuill &amp; ſinne, &amp;
al other euils and miſchiefes. And this is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, <hi>that therefore
Chriſt died and roſe agayne, that he might
be lord of al, both dead &amp; quicke, Rom.</hi> 14
and againe, <hi>Ye are not your own: for ye are
bought with a price, 1. Cor.</hi> 6. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is he made lord and king of his father o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
all the world, that al ſhould worſhip and
honour the ſonne, as they honour the father
him ſelfe: for he is not only the head of men,
but of all the Angels in heauen, as it is ſaid,
<hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him,
Heb. 1. Ephe.</hi> 1. Thus ye ſee how Chriſt is
appoynted Lorde and heyre of all thinges:
<pb facs="tcp:10917:26"/>
therefore is he called here our Lord, and we
then confeſſe our ſelues to be his ſeruantes
and ſubiectes, to do his wil and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.
He is called alſo our Lord, becauſe
we ſhould conceaue comfort by it in trouble,
that he will be a moſt gratious lord vnto vs
alſo, as wel as vnto others: as Thomas ſaid
of him, ſo muſt we ſay and bee perſwaded,
<hi>My God and my Lord. Iohn 21.
Which was conceiued by the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nowe foloweth his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy
ghoſt &amp; not by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeed of man: for if he had bin
conceiued by man, he had not bene voyde of
ſinne, as Ioh chap. 3. ver. 6. Iob. 6. chap. 25.
verſe. 5, 6. and ſo ſhoulde he haue bene vnfit
to deliuer vs from ſinne. Therefore our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
ſaith, <hi>For them I do ſanctifie my ſelf.
And ſuch an high Prieſt it became vs to
haue, which is holy, harmeles, vndefiled, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated
from ſinners, and made hier then
the heauens.</hi> As that which went before, did
proue vnto vs ſufficiently his diuinitie and
godhead, that he was yeſterday, to day &amp; for
euer, as is proued in the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
cha. 13. ſo this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ception in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wombe
of the virgin doth proue, that he is very and
true man, &amp; had a beginning according to
his humanitie, as the ſcriptures doe witnes
<pb facs="tcp:10917:27"/>
vnto vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>he was made of the ſeede of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
according to the fleſh. Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 1. And, <hi>that
God ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne into the world, made of a
woman, Gal.</hi> 4. The maner of this concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is deſcribed liuely vnto vs by S. Luk.
Cha. 1. For after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Angel had told Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that ſhe ſhould conceiue in her wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be, and
bring forth a ſonne, and cal his name Ieſus,
ſhe aſked howe it ſhould come to paſſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſhe knew no man: then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angel telleth
her, that the holy ghoſt ſhould come vpon
her, &amp; the power of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> moſt high ſhould ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow
her: therefore that holy thing which
ſhalbe borne of thee, ſhal be called the ſonne
of God. So likwiſe in Matth. 1. we reade,
that when Ioſeph her huſband would haue
put her away priuily, thinking ſhe had bene
with child of ſome ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the Angel called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him being thus minded, in a dreame, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Ioſeph, thou ſonne of Dauid, feare not
to take Mary for thy wife: for that which is
conceiued in her, is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt. We ſee
then that al fleſh in Adam had corrupted his
way before the Lord, &amp; that the ordinary ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was vncleane, therfore it was
neceſſary that Chriſt that ſhould redeeme
others from ſinne, ſhould not be ſubiect to it
himſelf, but bee borne by an extraordinarie
<pb facs="tcp:10917:27"/>
meane, to cleanſe vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all our ſinnes, both
original &amp; actual, which he was voyde of by
reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: wherfore Chriſt muſt
be both ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; God to redeeme vs: Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had offended, &amp; our ſinnes had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, as a cloude doth the bright
ſunne from our eies: &amp; he muſt be God alſo,
to make reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to God his father for
vs: for no Angel in heauen was able to do
this office of mediation, but the only God &amp;
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus Chriſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true mediator, for al our
ſinnes paſt, preſent, or to come. Here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider
the great loue of Chriſt toward mankinde,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> deſpiſed not our fleſh, to take it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him,
beeing God equall to his father, and hath
inueſted and couered himſelfe with our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but yet without ſinne. This doth teach
vs our duety towards him in tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfulnes, &amp;
our duty towards our neighbors in yelding
vnto them in matters for their behalf, &amp; not
to pleaſe our ſelues, but to beare with them,
&amp; debaſe our ſelues for them, as Chriſt hath
done for vs already. <hi>Phil. 2. Let the ſame
minde be in you, which was in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
We learne by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt by
the holy ghoſt, that he was thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued, to
make our ſinfull conception pure: For we
are conceiued and borne in ſinnes euery one
<pb facs="tcp:10917:28"/>
of vs, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beſt of vs al, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> come of Adam.
Dauid lamenteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> impurity &amp; imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his conception and birth, ſaying, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
Lorde, I was borne in iniquitie, &amp; in
ſinne hath my mother conceiued me, Pſal.</hi>
51. as if he would ſay, The cauſe of this my
outward ſinne &amp; actual, as murder &amp; adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
is, that I was conceiued in ſinne, and can
doe nothing els of my ſelfe but ſinne euery
houre: as Paul alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineth of himſelfe,
<hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 7. O wretched ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I am, who ſhal
deliuer me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bodie of this death?</hi> and
then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vnto Chriſt, &amp; thanketh him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
he hath deliuered him from it. We haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort our ſelues in this, that Chriſt was
conceiued for vs, borne for vs, &amp; died for vs,
&amp; whatſoeuer he did, he did it for our profite
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity. In that that Chriſt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
we alſo vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verity of Gods
promiſes made vnto vs in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophtes, which
had lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before prophecied of it: As in <hi>Eſai. 7.
Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>A virgin ſhall conceiue &amp;
beare a ſonne, and ſhe ſhall call his name
Immanuel.</hi> So we gather, that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
perfourmed this, he is alwayes iuſt &amp;
true in his promiſes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he maketh to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And furthermore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ſpake not by their own wil,</hi> (as Peter
ſaith) <hi>but by the wil &amp; ſpirit of God, euen
<pb facs="tcp:10917:28"/>
as they were led &amp; moued by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt,
2. Pet.</hi> 1. So y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whatſoeuer God ether ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

Emperours, for going about to ouerthrow
his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; flock. Although it be many

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly, or puniſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reprobate, yet it is
moſt ſure &amp; certaine, becauſe his mouth hath

ſaith of him, <hi>Hath he ſpoken, &amp; ſhal he not
performe it, &amp; ſaid it, &amp; ſhal he not make it
good?</hi> That were vnpoſſible. When we
ſay that Chriſt was conceiued in the wombe
of the virgin Marie his mother, by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and worke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt, we meane
that to bee ſpoken according to his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
only, and not according to his diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
for ſo hee is likened to Melchiſedech,
without father as touching his fleſh, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:10917:29"/>
mother as concerning his godhead, and
yet we ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt was conceiued, becauſe
Chriſt both God &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was ioined together
in one perſon. Therfore we muſt wiſely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguſh
&amp; make a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betweene y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> two
natures &amp; properties of Chriſt, his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hod &amp;
Godhead. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he can of him
ſelf do nothing, he iudgeth no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
not the day of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Goſpel, you muſt vnderſtand theſe
things to be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he was only man. In
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſaith he was before Abraham, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and he are al one, and that the ſcripture
termeth him, <hi>The firſt begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the lord of al things, the brightnes of
his father:</hi> theſe ſayings are all applied to
Chriſt, as he is the ſonne of God, and God
himſelfe, that made al things, as Iohn ſaith
of him, <hi>By him al things were made.</hi> If we
marke &amp; obſerue theſe two points, the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Chriſt, &amp; his humanity, we ſhal finde
great light and eaſines in reading the newe
teſtament: and things which were hard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

he was conceiued: which was, becauſe
he might become very man to redeeme and
ſuffer for man, offending the maieſtie of the

pray vnto his Maieſtie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſeeing his concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is pure &amp; vnſpotted, he would alſo make
ours ſo to be, with the free imputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his
conception &amp; all other benefites of his death
and paſſion, &amp; that he would kill ſinne in vs
more and more daily, by his ſpirit of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
that we may liue here in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

ſort of men, but of a maide or virgin,

Ieſus Chriſt was conceyued by the holy
Ghoſt, ſo was he borne likewiſe for mee of
his mother Marie, ſhe notwithſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning
ſtill a virgin. Out of the which
article we haue to note theſe three good leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and poyntes for our inſtruction and
conſolation. Firſt, the birth it ſelfe, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the maner of it, with all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the ſame, thirdly, the profit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
that we may reape by it, beleeuing
it truely as we ought to doe.</p>
                  <p>1 As concerning his birth, Eſai in his
ſeuenth and ninth Chapter ſaith, <hi>The Lord
him ſelfe ſhall giue you a ſigne. Beholde,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:30"/>
a virgin ſhall conceiue and beare a Sonne,
and ſhe ſhall call his name Immanuel:
butter and honie ſhall he eate, till he haue
knowelege to refuſe the euil, and to chuſe
the good.</hi> Likewiſe the ninth Chapter:
<hi>Vnto vs a childe is borne, and vnto vs a
ſonne is giuen, and the gouernment is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his ſhoulder, and he ſhal call his name,
Wonderful, Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeller, The mightie God,
The euerlaſting Father, The Prince of
peace: the increaſe of his gouernment and
peace ſhal haue no end, he ſhal ſit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
throue of Dauid, and vpon his kingdome,
to order it, and to eſtabliſh it with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and with iuſtice, from henceforth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for euer. The zeale of the Lord of hoſts
will performe this.</hi> Thus we ſee howe eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
Eſai long before propheſied of this
birth, to the comfort of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people in his time.
The like thing doeth Ieremie alſo declare
vnto vs in his propheſie, of this wonderful
natiuitie of our Sauiour Ieſus, ſaying in
his Chap. 23. <hi>Behold, the daies come, ſaith
the Lord, that I will raiſe vp vnto Dauid a
righteous branch, &amp; a king ſhal reigne &amp;
proſper, &amp; ſhal execute true iudgement &amp;
iuſtice vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth. In his daies Iuda ſhal
be ſaued, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely: and</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10917:31"/>
fulneſſe <hi>of time,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,
<hi>was come, then God ſent his Sonne made
of a woman, and made vnder the Lawe,
that he might redeeme them which were
vnder the Law, that we might receiue the
adoption of ſonnes, Gal. 4. God then, as in
this, ſo in all other things, is true and iuſt of
his promiſe and couenant, that he maketh
to a thouſand generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> as ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.
For nothing can let him, to bring his
words to paſſe, his power is infinit &amp; ouer
all. And although it be ſaid that Marie was
maried to Ioſeph, &amp; Ioſeph tooke her home
to him to be his wife, yet ſhe was a virgin,
for Ioſeph knewe her not: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt was
borne of her being a virgin, &amp; Ioſeph was
ſpouſed to her in this reſpect, that he ſhould
be an aide and comfort for her in her trouble
and paine, in her flight into Egypt, &amp; in her
great pouertie: for ſhe was ſo poore, that
ſhe had no chamber to be deliuered in, but
laid our Sauiour Chriſt in a manger. For
theſe cauſes, was Ioſeph called her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande
alſo, that ſhee myght be voyde of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
of fornication, and Chriſt not
thought to be borne out of wedlocke, or in
adulterie.</p>
                  <p>2 Secondly, for our inſtruction let vs
<pb facs="tcp:10917:31"/>
conſider the whole maner of Chriſts birth,
after what ſort and faſhion it was. S. Luke
doth declare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of it very liuely, &amp; ſaith,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ioſeph &amp; Mary were at Bethlehem,
the dayes were accompliſhed that ſhee
ſhoulde be deliuered, &amp; ſhe brought forth
her firſt begotten ſonne, and wrapped him
in ſwadling clothes, and layde him in a
cratch or manger, becauſe there was no
roume for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Inne.</hi> By theſe words
we ſee the maner of Chriſts birth, howe it
was very poore and baſe in reſpect of the
world, &amp; nothing glorious in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eies of men,
or as myght beſeeme ſo great a prince as
he was. He that might haue bene borne in a
moſt magnificent and royall palace, would
be borne in a ſtable or oxe ſtall, and he which
could haue bene layde in a moſt ſumptuous
bed of doune, with ſilke &amp; veluet wrought &amp;
garniſhed, yet notwithſtanding woulde bee
layde in a vile manger. This doth paſſe the
reach and capacitie of mans witte, and doth
expreſſe vnto vs, how that <hi>the Lords waies
are not our wayes, nor his doinges as
ours are:</hi> For then ſurely woulde hee not
haue had Chriſt his Sonne to bee borne ſo
poorely, and without al honour and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here in the earth. But here we ſee the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:32"/>
great loue of Chriſt towardes vs, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woulde
ſo be borne for our ſakes. So that in this is
fulfilled that notable ſaying if S. Paul the
Apoſtle. 2. Corinth. 8. Chap. 9. ſaying, <hi>Ye
know the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
he bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g rich, for your ſakes became poore,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye through his pouertie myght be made
rich.</hi> A notable leſſon to take pouertie in
good part, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord for iuſt cauſes lay it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs. And not only was he borne ſo poore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; miſerably, but alſo liued ſo afterwarde
all his life time, while he was here vpon the
earth, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſpace of 2. or 3. and thirty yeres,
inſomuch that when he was borne, he ſtedde
into Egypt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Herod y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſought to kil him,
no doubt with trouble &amp; paine. Afterward,
he liued with the beneuolence &amp; liberalitie
of certaine good wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as of Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene,
&amp; Ioanna y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wife of Chuza Herods
ſtewarde, &amp; Suſanna, &amp; many other which
miniſtred vnto him of their ſubſtance, Luk.
8. 3. ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he himſelfe doth pronounce to one
that would folow him for gaine &amp; eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in this life, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſonne of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> meaning him
ſelf, <hi>hath not where to lay or hide his hed,
but is in worſe caſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foxes which haue
holes, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> birds of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aire which haue their</hi>
neſts, Mat. 8. By this we learne to take po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty
<pb facs="tcp:10917:32"/>
patiently, which the Lorde himſelfe
hath ſanctified in his owne body, neither
to thinke it accurſed. And we learne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the contempt of this worlde, for Chriſt
had nothing glorious in the face and eyes
of man, hee was not riche, but poore. If
wee haue riches, let vs not thinke ſo
much, or highly of them, or be puffed vp
by them: for Chriſt had them not. If
wee be poore, let vs remember that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt was poore alſo in this life. It
is ſufficient for vs, and enough, if we
may be riche after this life, not that theſe
riches and worldly thinges are ill, if
they be vſed to Gods glory, but Chriſt
would teache vs by his example, that firſt
his kingdome is not of this world, &amp; then
not to be greeued if we lacke theſe tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye
thinges, for hee had them not at all:
wherefore if we haue meate and drinke and
raiment, we muſt be content. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of his birth, are the place of it, and
the tyme. As concerning the place, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe
and Luke both agree in one, that it
was Bethlehem, for ſo was it long before
prophecyed of by the Prophet Micheas.
Chap. 5. ſaying, <hi>And thou Bethlehem E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrathah,
art little to be among the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
<pb facs="tcp:10917:33"/>
of Iuda, yet our of thee ſhall come
foorth vnto me, one that ſhalbe the ruler
in Iſrael, whoſe goings foorth ſhall be
from the beginning and from euerlaſting.</hi>
Where hee ſetteth foorth vnto vs plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
both the humanitie of Chriſt, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
his diuinitie: his humanitie, in that
hee ſayth, hee came out of Bethlehem:
and his diuinitie, in that his going foorth
was from euerlaſting. The place then
was Bethlehem: no great and famous
citie as Ieruſalem was, but a poore and
obſcure towne, nothing ſpoken of among
men. Here wee may ſee againe, that as
Chriſt ſhewed great humilitie in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his birth, ſo did hee alſo in chuſing
ſo poore and vile a place as Bethlehem
was. And this was done no doubt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the wiſedome of the wiſe and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which woulde haue thought rather
that Chriſt ſhould haue bene borne at
Ieruſalem, or ſome ſuch like notable
and excellent citie. Well, our ſauiour
Chriſt choſe Bethlehem, and made it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
through his birth, and reiected all
other cities: ſo is fulfilled that ſaying of
Paul, <hi>God hath choſen the weake things
of the worlde, to confound the ſtrong,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:33"/>
and vile things, and things that are deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
hath God choſen, to bring to naught
the thinges that are, that no fleſhe ſhoulde
reioyce in his preſence. 1. Corinthians</hi>
1. Verſes 27. 28, 29. Let no man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be grieued or aſhamed, if he be borne
in a poore and baſe village, for ſo was
Chriſt borne, and hee is nothing the
worſe for it: hee may come as ſoone to
heauen, as they that are borne in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
cities. Neither let any man on the
contrarye, bragge and boaſt himſelfe, if
hee were borne in a famous place: this
maketh him not the better, or neerer to
God. Wee may ſee alſo at this day, where
Chriſt is moſt commonly to be founde:
not in great cities, and princes courts
ſo much, as in poore places, and obſcure
houſes. The wiſe men ſought him at
Ieruſalem the great citie, but Chriſt
was found in poore Bethlehem. Here
alſo learne, that the prophecies are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
ſtill: for Chriſt, as they had ſayed,
was borne in Bethlehem. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
beleeue the Prophets, either when
they comfort vs, or threaten vs for
ſinnes, for they ſhall alwayes be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.
The time of our Sauiours
<pb facs="tcp:10917:34"/>
birth was in the dayes and raigne of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode
the king, as Saint Matthewe ſayth,
Chapter. 2. and ſo had Iacob propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before, that Chriſt ſhould not be borne,
vntill the kingdome did ceaſe, and depart
from the race of the Iewes, and was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the nation of the Romanes, as <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis.
49. The ſcepter ſhall not depart
from Iuda, nor a Lawegiuer from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
his feete, vntil Shiloh come, and
the people ſhalbe gathered vnto him.</hi>
Meaning that Chriſt ſhould not be borne
and come among the Iewes, vntill ſuch
time as they had no kinges to rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them of their owne ſtocke, but of
ſtrangers, as Herode was at that time.
Chriſt beeing borne in the tyme of king
Herode, a wicked king, and a Tyrant,
doeth ſhewe himſelfe moſt fauourable
to the Iewes his people, being in great
bondage and miſerye. For when They
had moſt neede of a Sauiour and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
not only of their bodyes, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of their ſoules and conſciences, religion
being corrupted among them, and his word
reiected, then I ſay, Chriſt came, and was
borne a deliuerer vnto them. So is God
wont to deale in mercy toward his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:34"/>
then, and not before to ſende helpe,
when they are at the laſt caſte, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be deuoured, to teache them, that
when there is no helpe and ſuccour
in them ſelues, then is there moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ayde and comfort in him as hee ſayde
to Paul, <hi>My power is made perfect, and
is ſtrong in weakeneſſe,</hi> that when wee
are moſt weake and feeble, then is God
moſt ſtrong to deliuer vs from our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
He neuer deliuered the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
out of Egypt, vntill they were
brought to the extremytie, then hee ſent
them Moſes, and Aaron, and not before:
for hee will humble man, and let him to
vnderſtand, that when hee doeth any thing
for him, and deliuer him, or beſtowe any
gift vpon him in bodye or ſoule, it is
not for any thing that is in him, but
of his meere mercy and goodneſſe, to
make his praiſe the more to be ſeene,
and men more thankefull vnto him.
Let his praiſe therefore be continually in
our mouthes, and let vs magnifie his
name together, as ſayeth the Prophet
Dauid, <hi>Pſalme.</hi> 103. Chriſt then viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Iewes, when all thinges were
turned vpſide downe, his ſeruice was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
<pb facs="tcp:10917:35"/>
by the traditions of men, as the
Scribes, and Phariſes, and Sadduces,
who had corrupted the puritye of Gods
worde and doctrine, and brought in their
owne pelfe and maners, were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnreformed, the poore neglected,
the Prophetes deſpiſed, and Gods laue
ſet at nought. So that when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
came amongſt them, hee reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not any thing hee ſawe in them, but
their extreeme miſerie and thraldome,
which moued him to pitye them, and
ſo much the more, becauſe they had
ſuch a cruell Tyrant to rayne ouer them,
as murdered a great many of their
young infantes. So the Lorde came
amongſt vs of late: when his Goſpell
was layed aſide, and deuices of men, in
ſteade of it, were ſet vp, when his miniſters
were in euery place perſecuted, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
then he ſent a deliuerer to purge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to reſtore his trueth againe, to
pull downe Antichriſt, and to aboliſh
Poperie: hee reſpected not any thing in
vs, for wee like ſheepe were all gone
aſtray, euery man turned his owne
way: but hee did this, being minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of his mercy and promes made
<pb facs="tcp:10917:35"/>
freely vnto vs in Ieſus Chriſt: I pray
God wee may bee all truely thankefull,
for ſo great and wonderfull a benefite
beſtowed vpon vs, as the like was neuer
ſeene in our lande before. Surely good
cauſe wee haue to remember the Lorde
in our beddes, that giueth vs in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of our enemies, ſuch quietnes and reſt
from all perils and dangers. The thing
that followed immediately vpon this birth
of our ſauiour, was the comming of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
wiſe and famous men from the
Eaſt to worſhippe him, being ledde with
an extraordinary ſtarre thereunto. Thus
God the Father woulde adorne and
magnifie the birth of his ſonne, with
the reſort of theſe great and excellent
men. And herein no doubt they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gentiles, and the firſt fruites of them,
that came to our Sauiour, doe ſignifye
that the Gentiles alſo aſwel as the Iewes,
ſhoulde be called to be the people of
God, that there might be one folde and
one ſhephearde, as our Sauiour telleth
vs in the tenth Chaper of Iohns Goſpel.
This was comfortable for vs, being Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
men and Gentiles, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtrangers from God, to be made
<pb facs="tcp:10917:36"/>
the peculiar people of God, and to be
tranſlated from the kingdome of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
into the euerlaſting kingdome and
inheritance of his welbeloued ſonne. But
ſee howe the declaration and ſhewing of
this birth of ſo wonderfull a king, by the
wiſemen, was taken of Herode and the
Iewes in Hieruſalem: when they heard
the king of the Iewes to be borne, it is
ſayde, that Herode and all Ieruſalem
was troubled with him. Thus wee ſee the
nature and condition of the wicked, that
when they ſhoulde be glad, and reioyce in
the Lorde with thankeſgiuing for his
benefites, then they are troubled, they
murmure, and are vnthankefull. Here
all Ieruſalem had great occaſion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
them to prayſe God, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
not of it a whit, they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſleepe in their dregges of ſinne.
May, Herode went about to kill him,
that came to dye for him, and to ſaue
him, if hee coulde haue beleeued it. This
doeth alſo reproue our maner and doings
at this day: for when wee ſhould yeeld
God prayſe and thankes, wee giue him
none, and when he is moſt ready to doe
vs good, either wee conſider not of it,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:36"/>
or elſe vnthankfully refuſe it, as the ſwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe
Gergeſites did. Howe hath Chriſt
viſited vs in mercy, in giuing vs his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Goſpel the foode of our ſoules, as much
as euer hee did to the Iewes? and yet I ſay
wee are troubled ſtill in our mindes and
ſoules, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cares of this world, which do
choke the ſeede of his holy word. Wel (dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beloued) let vs learne to be wiſe, and to
conſider thankfully of Gods benefites in
time, leſt they be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from vs, as they were
from the Iewes, and giuen to a nation that
ſhal better receiue them, and make greater
account of them. The third thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſaide
was to be conſidered in the birth of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Ieſus Chriſt, is the profite and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may take &amp; apply to our ſelues,
our ſoules and bodyes by it, and what due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is required of vs in this behalfe. The
commoditie that ariſeth to vs and al Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
by his birth, is, that Chriſt came to
ſaue that which was loſt, as Paul doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
expreſſe the ende of his comming in
the fleſhe, ſaying, <hi>This is a true ſaying, and
by all meanes woorthy to bee receyued,
that Ieſus Chriſt came into this worlde to
ſaue ſinners, 1. Timothie</hi> 1. 15. Then
we perceiue this, that Chriſt was borne to
<pb facs="tcp:10917:37"/>
redeeme vs. If he had not bene borne, wee
could not haue byn redeemed by him from
the power of hell, and of Satan. This is a
great matter, and a moſt excellent &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
benefite. For we vnderſtande now
plainly &amp; clerely by the word of the Lorde,
that the ſeede of the woman hath broken y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
ſerpents head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. that there is a Lion
and a Lambe in diuers reſpectes, for his
ſtrength a Lion, and a Lambe by his meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
found worthy to open the booke, &amp; to
looſe the ſeuen ſeales of it, which no man
was able to doe, neither in heauen nor in
earth, nor vnder the earth, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 5. that
there is a <hi>childe,</hi> as <hi>Eſaie</hi> ſayth, <hi>giuen vnto
vs, vpon whoſe ſhoulders the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of heauen and earth is laide, and doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</hi>
We may ſaye therefore, that a man is
borne of the virgin Marie, the true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
ſonne of Adam, of Abraham, of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
which was promiſed in the lawe and
Prophets, ſuch a man I ſay, that hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
hell and death, and damnation, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuered
vs from the wrath of his father to
come. Of this, our faith may gather a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fruite and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modite; the one, that there
is a mediatour betweene God &amp; man, euen
the man Ieſus Chriſt: we haue this media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb facs="tcp:10917:37"/>
for vs in heauen already: the other, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by
the participation &amp; vnitie of his nature w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
ours, he receiueth &amp; admitteth vs into the
ſocietie of him ſelfe, and all his riches and
treaſures are made ours, euen as the wife
may ſay of her huſband, that al her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
goods &amp; lands are hers, becauſe ſhe is one
with him: ſo may we ſay of our moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
huſband &amp; bridegrome Ieſus Chriſt,
that all his ſtore is now become ours: <hi>For
we are bones of his bones, and fleſh of his
fleſh,</hi> as Paul telleth vs plainly, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.
If this be ſo, <hi>then wee ought to reioyce
and be glad in our heartes,</hi> as Paul ſayth,
<hi>which is, in the Lorde, becauſe that Chriſt
the great iewell of God is ſent into the
worlde.</hi> If we greatly reioyce &amp; triumphe,
when wee haue a mortall ſonne an heyre
here borne in earth vnto vs, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we knowe
not whether he ſhall be good or ill, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort
or paine vnto vs: If (I ſay) we do reioyce at
this vanity, what ought we to do (think ye)
dearly beloued brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we heare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
of God to be borne for vs, &amp; the heire of all
things, a ſonne that pacifieth his fathers
wrath iuſtly conceiued againſt ſinne, ſuch a
childe as maketh vs children, &amp; bringeth vs
into his heauenly poſſeſſion &amp; inheritance?
<pb facs="tcp:10917:38"/>
Ought we not (trow you) vnſpeakeably to
reioyce, &amp; thanke God and his ſonne Chriſt
continually? It is good reaſon ſo to do, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is our onely benefit, and not his: for he
came and was borne for vs, and not for him
ſelfe. The angels of God herein may teach
vs our duety, howe thankfull we ought to
be, and to reioyce for it, not with a worldly
and carnal ioy, as many do, but with a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and heauenly ioy of minde and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as few doe. At the birth of our ſauiour,
there was a company and multitude of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
ſouldiers prayſing God, and ſaying,
<hi>Glory be to God in the high heauens, and
peace in the earth, and towards men good
will, Luke</hi> 2. They reioyced in the Lord, &amp;
were thankful for it, &amp; yet are: much more
ought we to do the like, that his wil may be
done in earth of vs, as it is in heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, euen as we dayly pray. <hi>Thy
wil be done in earth, as it is in heauen.</hi> We
haue in deede a celebration of this natiuitie
of Chriſt, which is miſcalled of vs Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.
As y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name is euil, called Chriſtmas of
the Papiſts, as if Chriſt ſhould ſay Maſſe: ſo
is the time in it ſpent as lewdly of vs for the
moſt part, if not in maſſing, yet in maſking,
in carding and dicing, in dauncing, in bellie
<pb facs="tcp:10917:38"/>
cheere, in exceſſe of apparrell, and in fond
and fooliſhe playes &amp; ſportes, to paſſe the
time away. In theſe ſinnes and vanities,
is the tyme of Chriſtes natiuitie ſpent and
conſumed of vs. It were better to haue no
day of it, then ſo to keepe it: and it is a great
griefe to a godly mynde, to ſee that tyme
which ſhoulde be imployed to the ſeruice of
God, as it was in the primitiue Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
waſted and dedicated to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
vnto the deuill: for it is in it, as it
is vpon the Sundayes or Lordes day tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout
the yeere. The Sabbath which is
appoynted for to heare Gods woorde, and
to pray in, is turned altogether to play in,
and made a day of all wicked ſport and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
which is far from the ryght vſe of it, &amp;
yet no Magiſtrate doeth correct it. God
giue an amendement one day of it, to his
honour and glory. Amen. Well, ſo it is
with this time of our Sauiours birth: we
ſhoulde giue thankes in it, and wee neuer
thinke of our duetie in it the moſt part of
vs. If Emperours and Kinges haue cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
the memoriall of their birth dayes,
then there is greater reaſon, why we ſhould
remember the ioyfulleſt birth day that euer
was, or ſhalbe, I meane, of Ieſus Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:10917:39"/>
our ſauiour, borne ſo poorely and ſimply
for vs. Not that we ſhould ſo celebrate and
keepe Chriſts birth day, as wicked Herode
did celebrate his natiuitie, in feaſting, in
daunſing, in raſh ſwearing, and laſt of all, in
murdering the good ſaint of God, Iohn
Baptiſt, <hi>Matth. 14. Mark.</hi> 6. I ſay, we muſt
not ſo celebrate this birth day of Chriſt
with him, leaſt wee be partakers of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
and payne. But yet I feare a
great many doe keepe this time no better.
Neither muſt we keepe this day of our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Chriſtes birth, as Titus kept the birth
day of his brother Domitian, in killing the
Iewes for his pleaſure, to triumphe, and
ſo defiled his handes with innocent blood,
ſurely we do not much better: for although
we kill not with the ſworde, yet we wound
and kill our brethren with our tongues, we
quarrel, we fight, and are contentious, wee
ſweare and blaſpheme, and ſo reuile the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
Lorde, and this is done moſt of all at
the birth day of our Sauiour, as alſo vpon
this day of reſt, the Sunday, with cardes
and dice &amp; bloody othes. Wel, the Lord one
day will take an account of theſe things of
vs, vnleſſe we ſpeedily repent and amende.
Thus we haue heard the thinges that may
<pb facs="tcp:10917:39"/>
be noted vpon Chriſtes birth, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of it, with the fruite that commeth
vnto vs by it, and howe wee ſhoulde vſe this
day, and what is our duetie in it. Let vs
thanke our ſauiour Chriſt, that he woulde
be thus borne for vs, and pray vnto him that
we may remember it, and haue the ende of
this his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh, the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our
foules, which he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto vs: to whom w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
his father, and the holy ghoſt, be giuen all
prayſe and glory, for euer and euer: Amen.</p>

with certayne circumſtances of it, as what
foloweth after it. But here may a queſtion
be aſked, why there is no mention made of
his life, which went betweene his birth and

<pb facs="tcp:10917:40"/>
the benefites of his life be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended
in his death (for whatſoeuer he did in al his

his life is not here ſet down, becauſe we
do beleeue it in his death. This article of
Chriſts death is very neceſſary; for nothing
had bene brought to paſſe for our ſaluation,
neither ſhould we haue had any profite at al
by Chriſt, vnleſſe he had bin crucified for vs.
Therefore it is not ſufficient to beleeue his
conception &amp; natiuitie, except we alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
with our mouthes, and beleeue in our
hearts ſtedfaſtly his death and bitter paſſion
for vs. Therfore Chriſt is alwayes to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
of a Chriſtian man, as he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for his ſinnes. The meaning of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
is this in other words: I y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> am a chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

Chriſt my ſauiour ſuffered, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pilate was

moſt vniuſtly, and that he was crucified vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the croſſe or tree for my ſinnes, to redeeme
me, &amp; that he died for me, to bring me to life,
&amp; that he was buried and laide in the graue

body &amp; ſoule, to acquit me before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeat of God his father. In this article
are fiue things noted vnto vs. Firſt, vnder
<pb facs="tcp:10917:40"/>
whom he ſuffered, &amp; what iudge condemned
him: ſecondly, what maner of death he died,
he was crucified: thirdly, his death it ſelfe:
fourthly, what was done after, he was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
&amp; laſtly, what paines he ſuffered, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
into hel. Al theſe things are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
vnto vs in this one article: firſt is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto vs the name of him that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Chriſt, which is Pilate a Romane, as
<hi>Iohn</hi> 19. And this his name is ſet downe,
not only for the credit of the hiſtorie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
it the better, but alſo becauſe this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained
to the miſterie of our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that we might knowe his death to bee ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the condemnation of an earthly
iudge. For ſeeing that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Chriſt
not onely our ſinnes muſt bee purged, but
alſo the condemnation for them to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away: it was neceſſary that hee ſhould
die by the ſentence of a iudge, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
that we might be abſolued before the
great iudge of all the worlde. If Chriſt
had been killed by theefes, or murdered in
a tumult or ſedition by priuate men, there
had bene no redemption for vs in ſuch a
death, no kinde of ſatiſfaction. But when
we reade in the Euangeliſtes in their Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
that he was arraigned at the barre, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
<pb facs="tcp:10917:41"/>
by witneſſes, and condemned by the
ſentence of Pilate, (although iniuriouſlye,
hee pronouncing him iuſt, once or twiſe,
&amp; confeſſing that he found no fault in him)
we vnderſtand by thoſe thinges, that hee
ſuſtayned not the perſon of him ſelfe, but
of al vs moſt miſerable ſinners, that ſhould
haue bene ſo condemned before his father,
if he had not ſuffered this vnder Pontius
Pilate for vs. And here are two things
to be noted of vs, which are both confirmed
by the teſtimonies of the Prophets, and do
alſo giue a notable conſolation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
to our fayth: for when wee heare
that Chriſte was ſent to death, from the
iudgement ſeate, and was hanged betwene
the theeues, wee haue a full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that propheſie, which is cited of
the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt, <hi>He was reckoned or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among the wicked, Eſay.</hi> 53. And why
was this ſo? truely, that he might ſuſtaine
the condition and eſtate of a ſinner, and not
of a iuſt man, as hee ſuffered death, not for
righteouſnes ſake, but for ſin and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
of the wicked. Againe, when we
heare that he was pronounced innocent by
the ſame man, of whome he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
let vs remember that which another
<pb facs="tcp:10917:41"/>
Prophet ſpeaketh of him, <hi>I reſtored that
which I tooke not, Pſal.</hi> 69. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, Chriſt pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for ſin, &amp; bought if full dearely, which he
neuer had, nor committed: for there was no
guile found in his mouth. And why did Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
then condemne him? Becauſe he feared
man more then God, &amp; Ceſars diſpleaſure
more then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of God: for when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cryed, <hi>If thou let him goe, thou art not
Caeſars friend,</hi> then he conſented vnto them
to crucify him againſt his owne conſcience,
to pleaſure the people, &amp; to gratifye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Tiberius.</hi> So we ſee, that he was a
parcial, feareful, &amp; vniuſt iudge, &amp; had not
the properties of a good iudge, as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 18. Firſt, that they ſhould be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of courage, ſecondly, fearing God, thirdly,
men dealing truely, fourthly, hating coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes.
Let all Iudges take example &amp;
warning by Pilate, to execute iuſtice and
iudgement indifferently to all men. For
Pilate afterward, as hiſtories recorde, for
anguiſh and ſorowe of minde hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
as Iudas did before him. And here
wee ſee, that as a Romane then condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Chriſt, and as alwayes afterwarde hee
was perſecuted by the Romaine Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
ſo it is at this day by that great
<pb facs="tcp:10917:42"/>
Antichriſt of Rome, the Pope and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herentes:
he is ſtill perſecuted in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
This is the iuſt iudgement of God
vpon them. God giue them grace (if it bee
his will) to repent, &amp; to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the trueth, Amen. Secondly, let
vs conſider the maner of his death what it
was. It was the croſſe, moſt ſhamefull and
accurſed, not onely in mans ſight, but alſo
of God him ſelfe. <hi>Deut. 21. The curſe of
God is on him that is hanged.</hi> This Paul
repeateth, <hi>Gala.</hi> 3. and ſaith, <hi>Chriſt hath
redeemed vs from the curſe of the lawe,
being made a curſe for vs, for it is written:
Curſed is euery one that hangeth on tree.</hi>
Thus we ſee ſtill in euery article, and in
euery point of our ſaluation, that excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great loue of Chriſt our maſter to vs,
that not onely he was contented to ſuffer
moſt grieous paine for vs, but alſo ſhame
and reproche, ignominie and contempt of
the worlde. He was at the firſt taking, led
away to Annas and Caiaphas, and then
poſted ouer to Pilate. Pilate ſent him to
Herode, and Herode ſent him back againe
with mockes and tauntes in a purple robe
in mockage, &amp; deriſion of him. And all this
did our ſauiour Chriſt for vs. This was
<pb facs="tcp:10917:42"/>
much that I haue rehearſed already, but
yet nothing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of the croſſe: for the
croſſe was as odious &amp; ſhameful to them, as
the gallowes is to vs, &amp; yet Chriſt was wel
contented with it, ſo wee might bee redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
This is that Paul ſpeaketh of to the
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. willing vs to follow the great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie
of Chriſt in his ſuffering of ſhame,
ſaith, <hi>Let vs alſo, ſeeing that we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
with ſo great a cloude of witneſſes,
caſt away euery thing that preſſeth down,
and ſinne that hangeth ſo faſt on: let vs
runne with patience, the race that is ſet
before vs, looking vnto Ieſus the author &amp;
finiſher of our faith, who for the ioy that
was ſet before him, endured the croſſe, &amp;
deſpiſed the ſhame, and is ſet at the right
hand of the throne of God. Conſider
therfore him that endured ſuch ſpeaking
agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt of ſinners, leſt ye ſhould be wearied
and faint in your mindes.</hi> We ſee many
men can abide to ſuffer paine and griefe,
which yet notwithſtanding are ouercome
with ſhame and reproche, and can hardly
abide it. One peraduenture could bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to ſuffer ſome trouble for his deare
friende, but who will bee hanged for his
friende? <hi>Let the ſame minde therefore
<pb facs="tcp:10917:43"/>
dearely beloued be in you, that was euen
in Chriſt Ieſus, who being in the forme
of God, thought it no robberie to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
with God, but hee made himſelfe of
no reputation, and tooke on him the ſhape
of a ſeruant, and was made like vnto men,
and was found in ſhape as a man: he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himſelfe, and became obedient vnto
the death, euen the death of the croſſe.</hi>
You ſee out of this place, howe Chriſt for
our ſakes abaſed himſelfe to ſhame, which
conſiſteth in foure poyntes. It was much
for him being God, to become man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it had bene King, or Prince, or Lorde:
but it was more to become a miſerable
man, a ſeruant vnto men: more then that,
it was to die: but moſt of all was it worthy
prayſe and commendation, that he died the
death of the croſſe, not for his friendes, but
for his foes. Many other thinges did our
ſauiour ſuffer of the people, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scribes, the
Phariſes, &amp; the Iewes: as reuilings, &amp; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,
bitter nippes, and tauntes, but al
was nothing to this croſſe, it ſurmounteth
all: &amp; yet for all this, we muſt not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of him, for hee is our glory, <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.
1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. they that are aſhamed of him
here in earth before men, he wil be aſhamed
<pb facs="tcp:10917:43"/>
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before his father &amp; his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
Let vs therfore confeſſe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Chriſt crucified for vs, and let vs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be aſhamed of him, when hee commeth
with his croſſe, for he that taketh not vp his
croſſe dayly &amp; followeth him, is not worthy
to be his diſciple, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. He might rather
haue bene aſhamed of vs, to ſee vs in that
caſe we were, worſer then wee can ſee any
poore miſerable begger, amongſt vs here
in earth. We ſee then, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by Chriſt crucified,
the bleſſing of Abraham is come vpon vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
were Gentiles, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the ſerpents
head is broken, he being y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> true ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t lifted
vp vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe, to ſaue al thoſe that hope
vpon him by fayth, as the other braſen ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
lyfted vp by Moſes in the wildernes,
ſaued all thoſe Iſraelites y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> were ſtong, &amp;
looked vp vnto it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. verſe. 9. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
by this croſſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hande writing of
ordinances which was againſt vs, &amp; which
was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to vs, he, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he tooke it out of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, &amp; faſtened it vpon the croſſe, &amp; hath
ſpoyled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> principalities, &amp; powers, &amp; hath
made a ſhew of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, &amp; hath triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame croſſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. Of this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying,
&amp; lifting vp vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe, was Iſaac
a figure, who was bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; laid vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> altar,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:44"/>
ready to be offered. And ſo were al the ſinne
offerings layde vpon the altar: for he was
made of God his father ſinne for vs, that
wee might he made the righteouſnes of
God in him, which knewe no ſinne, 2. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi>
5. But of all other types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
of the ceremonial lawe, this taking
away of ſinne by Chriſt in his croſſe, was
moſt liuely ſet forth and repreſented vnto
vs, as in a glaſſe, in the ſcaps goate. For the
Lord commanded Aaron <hi>Leuit.</hi> 16. that
he ſhould take a liue hee goate, and preſent
him quicke before the Lorde, to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
by him, and that he ſhould put
his handes vpon the head of the goate, and
confeſſe ouer him all the iniquities of the
children of Iſrael, and all their treſpaſſes, &amp;
all their ſinnes, putting them vpon the
head of the goate, &amp; ſhould ſend him away,
by the hande of a man appointed, into the
wildernes: ſo the goate ſhall beare vpon
him all their iniquities into the lande that
is not inhabited. Here was our ſauiour
Chriſt figured, <hi>which bare in his body vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the croſſe, the iniquities of vs al, Eſai.</hi> 53.
1. <hi>Pet. 2. and was wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,
and caried away al our ſorowes,
for by his ſtripes are wee healed. Eſay.</hi> 53.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:44"/>
Furthermore, this betraying and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of Chriſt, and ſelling of him for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pence, was alſo forefigured in Ioſeph.
For as Ioſeph was ſolde of his owne bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
into the handes of ſtrangers: ſo was
Chriſt betrayed and ſold of his owne diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
anddeliuered of his owne nation into
the handes of Pilate and the Heathen. The
third thing that followeth in this article, is
his death. He was dead in deede, as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſtes
doe report: for Luke ſayth of
him, <hi>that he cryed with a loude voyce and
ſayde, Father, into thy hands I commend
my ſpirit. And when he had thus ſayd, he
gaue vp the ghoſt, Luk</hi> 23. So for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of it, it is not onely ſaid that he was
crucified, but alſo that he died: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
nothing had bene wrought for vs.
God ſayde to Adam, <hi>In what day ſoeuer
thou ſhalt eate of the forbidden tree of
knowledge of good and euill, thou ſhalt
die the death.</hi> Adam offended and brake
this commandement: hee was not able to
make ſatiſfaction for it, to die the death of
body and ſoule: therfore the ſecond Adam
Ieſus Chriſt died the death of body, &amp; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the death in ſoule, to redeeme vs, and
to ſatiſfie Gods wrath &amp; diſpleaſure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb facs="tcp:10917:45"/>
moſt iuſtly againſt our ſinne in
Adam. This death was ſignified in euery
ſacrifice of beaſtes in the olde lawe of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
in the killing of bullockes, of calues,
of ſheepe, of goates, and ſuch other things.
For as the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of blood was no remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi>
This was verified in Chriſtes blood, ſhed
for vs in his death. Neither was this death
of Chriſt to be ſeene onely ſhadowed in the
ceremonies of the Leuiticall lawe, but alſo
in diuers men. As Samſon, who died him
ſelfe to deliuer his people from the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims:
ſo Chriſt, to deliuer vs from the
deuils, died him ſelfe. Dauid alſo was
a figure of him in many thinges. Here we
ſee then, what a grieuous thing ſinne was
in Gods ſight, that he could be pacified by
no other meanes, then by the blood &amp; death
of his only and welbeloued Sonne Ieſus.
Surely our ſinnes were as hard as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant
ſtone, which could not be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by
any other meanes, then by the blood of the
true goate Ieſus Chriſt. Conſider here the
wonderfull &amp; vnſpeakeable loue of Chriſt:
he would die for vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might eſcape: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pelicane, which hauing brought forth
<pb facs="tcp:10917:45"/>
her young ones dead, or being ſtong &amp; kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, ſhe pecketh forth her heart
blood to reuiue her young ones: ſo we, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conceiued and borne in ſinne, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
dead in our treſpaſſes and offences,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. ſtong of that old and fiery ſerpent
the diuell, which firſt beguiled our parents
in paradiſe, and ſo hauing the rewarde of
ſinne which is death: we (I ſay) in this caſe
are reuiued and quickened againe, by the
blood of that true Pelicane Ieſus Chriſt,
which hee from his heart hath ſhead and
powred out for vs. Thus we ſee how deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we are indebted to Chriſt for his great
loue to vs, in dying for our ſinnes, and yet
how fewe remember this death! Many, not
once in a day, nay, not once in a weeke, or
moneth, I feare, ſome, not once in a whole
yeere doe remember it well: they are the
more vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>keful, &amp; vnkind ſonnes to God
ſo good a father, &amp; Chriſt ſo louing a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhould eſpecially
be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, although all other things be
forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Beleeue me (deare brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) Chriſt
died not to this ende, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his death ſhould be
forgotten, which was ſo cruell to him, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
it ſhould be lightly reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred of vs, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he
might haue vs to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
<pb facs="tcp:10917:46"/>
his laſt ſupper, in bread &amp; wine: the
bread broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to put vs in minde of his moſt
pure &amp; pretious body broken &amp; bruiſed for
our ſinnes, &amp; that it doeth nouriſh vs, as the
bread doth nouriſh our bodies: <hi>for his fleſh
is meat in deede Iohn</hi> 6. The wine ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to put vs in mind of his blood powred
out for vs, <hi>to waſh vs from al our ſinnes,
1. Iohn</hi> 1. &amp; that as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine doth quench our
thirſt, and refreſh vs, &amp; comfort our hearts
being ſoroweful: ſo doeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blood of Chriſt
al theſe things vnto vs, in greater meaſure
and abundance. This doeth alſo teache vs
vnitie &amp; loue together, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as many grapes
make but one wine, and many graynes of
corne &amp; wheate make but one lofe of bread:
ſo ſhould we be but one in Chriſt our head,
for we are all members of the ſame body.
The other ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alſo of Baptiſme, doth
put vs in minde of Chriſtes death: for as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
water in baptiſme doth waſh the body: ſo
doeth the blood of Chriſt waſh our ſoules,
and clenſe them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their filthines. Which
thing is repreſented vnto vs in our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
a ſigne of our newe birth and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
by the ſpirite of Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in our baptiſme we ought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
this death, for wee are buried with him
<pb facs="tcp:10917:46"/>
into his death, by this ſeale and ſacrament
of our baptiſme, as Paul proueth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.
Nowe we ſee, that to the ende we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
this great benefite of Chriſtes
death, we haue tokens of it, two in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
the ſupper of Chriſt, and baptiſme: for
<hi>by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhew forth the Lords death, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he come againe to iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, 1. Cor.</hi> 11.
Nowe if any man marueile why we dye,
ſince Chriſt hath died for vs, &amp; taſted death
once for all men, to make reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for
the ſinnes of the people, &amp; to ſatiſfie Gods
iuſtice: he may be anſwered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt hath
taken away the ſecond death of the ſoule, &amp;
not this firſt &amp; naturall death of the body,
which is common to all, for by it we enter
into life: and although it be ſometime grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
to Gods children, yet it is not deadly
to them, nay rather, ioyfull, ſeeing by it
they come to Chriſt their head, as it was
to Paul: <hi>I deſire,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to be looſed, and
to be with Chriſt,</hi> meaning, to die. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
this death of the body dwelleth in vs,
yet it hath no dominion ouer vs, by the
force and efficacie of Chriſtes death. And
wee knowe that it is made nowe to the
elect, a gate to paſſe by into heauen. We
ſhould not then feare death, ſeeing that
<pb facs="tcp:10917:47"/>
the loſſe of this tranſitory life, is the high
way into Gods euerlaſting kingdome.
And this may bee anſwered concerning
ſinne alſo. If any man aſke, howe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to paſſe, that wee haue ſinne ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in vs, ſeeing Chriſt hath died for
it to take it away: I anſwere, that Chriſt
hath taken awaye the condemnation of
ſinne, that it ſhall not hurt vs, to bring vs
to deſtruction, but the full aboliſhing of
ſinne ſhall ceaſe in the latter day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when all thinges ſhall bee reſtored
againe to their perfection, <hi>Actes</hi> 5. So
that now we may ſay, There is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of ſinne to them that are in Chriſt
Ieſus, which walke not after the fleſh, but
after the ſpirite, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. For ſee the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
working of God, that all the curſes
and paynes that were in Ieſus Chriſt, are
turned to our bleſſings and ioyes: his death
is our life, his pouerty our riches, his ſhame
our glory, his deſcenſion into hell, is made
our aſcenſion into heauen: and finally, his
miſery here in this life, is made our felicitie
and happineſſe in the life to come. This is
the Lordes doing, and it is marueilous in
our eyes. O that men would therefore
prayſe the Lorde for his goodnes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb facs="tcp:10917:47"/>
the wonders that hee doeth for the
children of men! This death of Chriſte
hath two benefites in it: for firſt it cauſeth
that wee ſhall not die in the life to come,
and then here it mortifieth our earthly
members, it killeth our olde man Adam
within vs, that it bringeth not foorth his
accuſtomed actions of ſinne within vs.
Thus much concerning his death. Let vs
nowe conſider briefly the fourth poynt in
this article, which is his buriall. Chriſte
was buried by an honourable Counſeller,
Ioſeph of Arimathea, and Nicodemus,
a ruler of the Iewes, who begged his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
boldly of Pilate, and buried it with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
as the maner was, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. His
buriall is mentioned, to aſſure vs that hee
died in deede, as when wee ſee a man bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
wee doubt not but that hee is dead.
The leſſon that we learne by this buriall of
Chriſt, is this, as the Apoſtle Paul teacheth
vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. and <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. that we ſhould
ſo through baptiſme bee freed and buried
from ſinne, as he was buried in the graue,
that like as Chriſte was rayſed vp from
the dead to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glorie of his father: ſo we alſo
ſhould walke in newenes of life. So then,
as we are crucified with Chriſt vnto ſinne,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:48"/>
and dead and buried thereto, ſo muſt wee
riſe againe with him vnto righteouſnes.
But of this, more (God willing) in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> article
of his reſurrection. The laſt thing to be
noted in this death of Chriſt, is the paynes
which he ſuffered, which is called his deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion
into hell. Although this bee laſt in
wordes, yet in ſenſe it is to be ioyned with
his crucifying, and went before his death in
body, and buriall in the ſepulchre. The
meaning therefore of this his deſcenſion, is
this: that Chriſt our ſauiour, to redeeme
vs both in body and ſoule, which had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
God, ſuffered the tormentes of hell, the
wrath infinite of his father for the time, not
onely in body, but alſo in ſoule, and did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
the moſt bitter and vnſpeakeable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
of death in his minde and conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
preſſed downe with the burden of all our
ſinnes, as if hee had bene forſaken of God
his father. In this hell and torment, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he was in his heauy agony in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
when he ſwette (as it were) teares of
blood trickling downe from his face: his
ſoule was verie heauie and ſorowfull, euen
vnto the death, ſo that there came an angel
and comforted him from heauen, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.
This hell was ſo great vnto him, that he
<pb facs="tcp:10917:48"/>
prayed his Father, <hi>if it were poſſible, that
the cuppe of his paſſion myght paſſe from
him:</hi> Yea, which was moſt of all, he was
compelled for the very anguiſh and griefe
of heart and ſoule,<note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 1.</note> to ſay and cry out: <hi>O my
God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 27. 46.</note> 
                     <hi>my God, why haſt thou forſaken
me?</hi> So that all the things that Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
before, were nothing to this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> now he
ſuffered, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he cryed out for very payne, &amp;
extreme ſorowe of minde. For we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber,
that Chriſt vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe, did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuffer paines in body, (as they did which
were crucified w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, which were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paines
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes did put him to) but farther, he
ſuffered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> extreme wrath of God his father,
hanging vpon him, heauier then heauen and
earth, which no angel was able to endure: &amp;
therfore, that he might be able to endure and
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quer it, it was neceſſarie, that he ſhould
be God alſo, as well as man. For he ſuffred
for all the ſinnes, originall, and actuall, in
thought, worde and deede, of all men that
euer were or are, or ſhall be from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the worlde, from Adam vntill the
ende of it, I ſay, he hath ſuffred ſufficiently
for them all, and as great paynes and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as any damned ſoules in hell can or
ſhall ſuffer. And was not this an hell (trowe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:49"/>
you) vnto our Sauiour, to abide in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and ſoule, all theſe torments, which can
not be vttered with any eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or tongue
of man? Nothing had bene done for vs, if
Chriſt had dyed the common death of the
body onely, as other dyd. It was neceſſarie
therefore and very expedient, that we might
be perfectly redeemed in both partes both
body and ſoule, that hee ſhoule feele the
ſeuere puniſhment of the vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God,
becauſe he powred out his ſoule an offering
for ſinne, and tooke vpon him our part,
which were the malefactors and offendors,
to bring vs vnto the fauour of God againe.
We muſt not thinke then, (yea God forbid
we ſhoulde) that he ſuffered no more payne
then the Iewes put him to, or the other two
dyd which hanged with him. For we ſee
they cryed not out as Chriſt dyd, for they
felt not ſo much as he did, which ſuffred for
the whole worlde. And all this was for our
cauſe: Let vs then applie it as a medicine
to our wounds, otherwiſe it will not heale
vs. Take the ſhielde of fayth, that when
yee are in great torment and griefe for
your ſinnes, (as Satan doeth many times
obiect them vnto you) when yee are euen
at the brinke of deſperation, then this will
<pb facs="tcp:10917:49"/>
be a notable comfort vnto you, to beare off
all aſſaultes and grieuous tentations, yea,
to quench the fiery dartes of the deuil, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that our Sauiour Chriſt ſuffered
the torments of hel euery one of them, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
you from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This one leſſon, if it be
well learned, &amp; ſurely ſetled in our hearts,
will heale a wounded conſcience, will rayſe
vs vp from the gates of hel, and will in our
greateſt diſtreſſe, be very ſweet vnto vs. Be
our ſinnes neuer ſo many, either as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſands
of the ſea, or as the ſtarres of heauen, as they
can not be ſo many: yet Chriſts mercy is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, &amp; greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they, &amp; hath paide
a ſufficient price and ranſome for them all.
If they were as redde as purple or as crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
yet they ſhalbe made as white as wool,
and like to ſnowe, Eſay. 1. A notable &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
place: for before, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rebuked them of their grieuous ſinnes
and offences, and nowe in theſe words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
them mercy, if they will repent and
amende, and ſo turne to the Lord with their
whole heart. In this, that Chriſt hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the tormentes of hell for all, we gather,
that all that are ſaued, are ſaued by Chriſt
alone, from Adam vntill this time, and to
the ende of all the world: for he is the lambe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:50"/>
ſlayne from the beginning of the worlde,
Reuel. 13. That is to ſay, his death and
paſſion was as effectuall to redeeme al that
were before him, that dyd beleeue in him
that he ſhoulde come, as it was auayleable
afterwarde to ſaue all that are after him,
which do beleeue that he is come in the fleſh
already to ſaue them. This is that, that our
Sauiour meant, when he ſayde,<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 56.</note> that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
reioyced to ſee his dayes, and ſawe
them:</hi> that is, reioyced in Chriſt, that he
ſhoulde be his Sauiour.<note place="margin">Actes 4. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>For none other is
there giuen vnder heauen wherin we muſt
be ſaued, Actes.</hi> 4. Thus wee ſee what is
meant by theſe words, <hi>deſcended into hell:</hi>
howe he ſuffered helliſh tormentes for vs,
not that his ſoule went into hell after his
death, for it was in paradiſe, in the hands of
God, as he commended it to his Father, &amp;
as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoules of the bleſſed are, &amp; his body was
in the graue. Neither is there any place of
ſcripture to proue any other diſcenſion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
this, which is ful of trueth &amp; comfort. They
alledge y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> place of Dauid, Pſal. 16. 10. But
that doth proue vnto vs his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
his body ſhoulde not be left in the graue, as
others were, to ſee corruption and to rotte,
as Peter doeth apply it, <hi>Act,</hi> 2. 27. to proue
<pb facs="tcp:10917:50"/>
his reſurrection from death, and not his deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion
into hell. The place of 1. Peter. 3.
doeth ſhewe, that <hi>the Spirite of Chriſt was
in the dayes of Noe, and preached by him
to the wicked which were then rebellious
and diſobedient, and are nowe damned
ſoules in hell,</hi> which he tearmeth <hi>ſpirites in
pryſon.</hi> This is the meaning of Peter in
that place, (as alſo good interpreters doe
prooue.) Neyther did Chriſt deſcende into
hell to fetch the godly Patriarkes from
thence, which dyed in his faith before his
comming in the fleſh, for they were in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
already as concerning the ſoule, for <hi>the
ſoules of the righteous are in the hands of
God, and no torment ſhall touch them,
Wiſd.</hi> 3. Here then ſeeing Chriſt hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
and fulfilled all things for vs, we may
ſaye to God as concerning his iuſtice, O
righteous God, if ſhame, confuſion and
ignominie bee due to ſinners for their euill
deſertes, if death bee the ſtipende and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of ſinne, Rom. 6. 23. If it deſerue thy
wrath and indignation moſt ſeuere, If it be
worthy to be puniſhed not onely with moſt
ſharpe paynes of body, but alſo extreeme
torments of mynd and conſcience: briefely,
if it deſerue hell and damnation for the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:51"/>
and filthineſſe of it: Then O moſt iuſt
Father and God, Chriſt thy Sonne hath
ſuffered all theſe thinges to the vtmoſt, hee
hath paide al whatſoeuer thou canſt require
of mee, for ſinne,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 14.</note> he hath perfourmed thy
bande and obligation, and hath clearely can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celed
the handwriting that was againſt me.
For can there bee a greater burden with
meaſure more heaped and full, and preſſed
downe, appoynted for ſinne and iniquitie,
then this was, which Chriſt Ieſus thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
&amp; only Sonne, which was in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
hath borne already for me? Therefore
I beſeeche thee moſt deare and tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whenſoeuer my ſinnes ſhall come into
thy ſight, or queſtion with thee, which my
aduerſarie the deuill layeth before thee and
me, that then thou wouldeſt looke vpon
Chriſt thy Sonne, which is thy true loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
glaſſe, in whom thou ſhalt finde me to
be moſt pure and innocent, and to be of the

moſt bryght in his righteouſneſſe, which he
giueth vnto me by faith, if I beleeue in him,
as I can perſwade my ſelfe moſt certainely
and vnfaynedly that I doe. Good Father,
for his ſake receiue me into mercie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe
thy heauenly bleſſings vpon me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:51"/>
hee hath deſerued them well at thy
handes. This prayer with boldneſſe and
confidence in Chriſtes blood, may a true
Chriſtian man make to God the Father,
when his ſinnes ſhall begin to accuſe him:
and herein may he finde comfort, otherwiſe
none at all. For God is not pleaſed, but in
Chriſt and in his doings, as he ſaith, <hi>This
is my welbeloued Sonne, heare him, Matt.
3. and</hi> 17. Where we note, that Chriſt is
our onely reconciler to God, and our onely
ſcholemaſter to teach vs the trueth of Gods
worde. Thus haue we heard in this article,
the death of Chriſt, a wonderfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
myſterie, the circumſtances of it,
the cauſe of the ſame, the paines he ſuffered,
and what comfort we haue and enioy by it.
Nowe let vs giue to our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moſt heartie, earneſt, and continuall
thankes for it, and likewiſe to Ieſus
Chriſt, that woulde vouchſafe to take it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him for our ſakes, ſuch poore and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
wretches as wee were. It is the
greateſt and moſt precious Iewel and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monde
that God coulde beſtowe vpon vs.
Let vs therefore pray vnto him, to make vs
deepely conſider of the valewe of it in our
hearts and mindes, that we ſlightly eſteeme
<pb facs="tcp:10917:52"/>
not of ſo excellent a treaſure, but that wee
may ſell all, and buy it. Let vs further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
deſire of him, that by the death of his
Sonne, hee woulde kill in vs all carnall
and worldly luſtes, and mortifie our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
members, pride, concupiſcence, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hatred, couetouſneſſe and ſuch lyke
ſinnes, that wee walke in them no more.
Nowe ſeeing Chriſt hath dyed for them, to
put them all away, and hath faſtned and
nayled them to his Croſſe, that we ſhoulde
ſerue him (being deliuered from the handes
of our enemies) without feare, all the
dayes of our life, in holineſſe and true righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
before him: This God graunt
vnto vs for Chriſts ſake, to whome with the
holy Ghoſt, one bleſſed God, be rendred all
prayſe, and glory, and thankes giuing for
euer, and euer, Amen.</p>

orderly in the beliefe after his death &amp;

two together, his death and riſing againe,
ſaying to his diſciples, Mat. 26. 21. <hi>Behold,
we goe vp to Ieruſalem, and the ſonne of
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhalbe deliuered vnto the chiefe prieſts
and ſcribes, and they ſhall condemne him

to mocke &amp; to ſcourge &amp; to crucifie, but
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third day he ſhal riſe again.</hi> This was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

be killed, yet they might take as great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

the dead. Chriſtes enemies did in deede what
they might and coulde, to keep him downe
ſtill: they layd a great ſtone and heauie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his graue, they ſealed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtone, they made
<pb facs="tcp:10917:53"/>
the ſepulchre ſure w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a watch of ſouldiers,
Matth. 27. 66. But all was in vayne: for
Chriſt muſt needes be true of his worde and
promiſe, to ariſe againe the third day, as he
had often foretolde and prophecied of to his
Apoſtles, and of the which they were al wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and as S. Paul ſaith, <hi>moe then fiue
hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at once did ſee him.</hi> If any
require teſtimonies of his reſurrection out
of ſcripture, let him read the 28. of <hi>Matth.</hi>
the 16 of <hi>Mar.</hi> the 24. of <hi>Luke,</hi> the 20. &amp; 21.
of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. with many other
places of ſcripture. Wherefore no man can
doubt of the trueth of this article, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by ſo many places of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God.
This reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was very neceſſary: for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it had folowed, and Chriſt riſen again,
nothing had bene wrought concerning our
ſaluation, neither had death bene conquered,
nor ſata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſtroied, nor we redeemed perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the dolours of death. Therefore S.
Peter ſaith, <hi>that God hath raiſed him vp, &amp;
looſed the ſorowes of death, becauſe it was
vnpoſſible that he ſhoulde be holden of it,</hi>
Acts 2. 24. as Dauid alſo proueth, Pſa. 16.
<hi>Thou ſhalt not leaue my ſoule in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graue,
neither ſhalt thou ſuffer thy holy one to ſee
corruption.</hi> This article doth proue vnto
<pb facs="tcp:10917:53"/>
vs, that Chriſt is both man and God:man, in
that he did riſe with his body in the which he
fell and died before, for it is vnproper to ſay
that God doth riſe againe, for he doth neuer
fall. His reſurrection doth proue him to be
God alſo, becauſe he rayſed vp himſelfe the
third day, as he teſtifieth, <hi>Deſtroy this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
(meaning of his body) <hi>and in three daies
I wil reare it vp agayne, Ioh.</hi> 2. 20. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſaide, that he was rayſed vp by the glorie
of his father, but that is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as concerning
his humanity, wherin he is inferior to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Seeing then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the croſſe, death &amp; bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
of Chriſt, doth appeare a kinde of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
and weakenes in reſpect of the world,
becauſe theſe things in Chriſt ſeeme baſe to
many: wee haue to goe further for the full
ſtrengthening of our faith, to his moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
&amp; victorious reſurrection ouer al his
enemies: for although we haue a ful accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of our ſaluation in his death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that by it wee are reconciled to God,
and ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made to his iuſtice for our

                     </hi> (not by his

<pb facs="tcp:10917:54"/>
1. <hi>Epiſt. 1. Chap. Bleſſed be God, euen the
father of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

vs againe vnto a liuely hope, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of Ieſus Chriſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead, to an

withereth not, reſerued in heauen for vs,
which are kept by the power of God tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
faith vnto ſaluation, which is prepared

Chriſt ſhal come to iudgement) <hi>and we ſhal
riſe in our bodies.</hi> Wherefore as Chriſt by
riſing ſo triumpha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, became co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querour of
death: ſo the victory of our faith doeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
eſpecially in his reſurrection, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the
holy Apoſtle doth plainly expreſſe it, Rom.
4. 25. for he ſaith, <hi>that Chriſt was deliuered
from our ſinnes, but is riſen againe for our
iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, By his death
was ſinne take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away &amp; aboliſhed, but iuſtice
and righteouſneſſe was reſtored &amp; renewed
vnto vs by his reſurrection from death.
For otherwiſe, how could he haue deliuered
vs from death by dying, if he himſelf had bin
ſwallowed vp of death? or howe ſhould he
haue gotten vs the victorie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had loſt it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?
This thing the Prophete Oſee foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the ſpirite of God, ſpake propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<pb facs="tcp:10917:54"/>
as Dauid and other Prophets did, of
this reſurrection of our ſauiour, ſaying, <hi>O
death, I wil be thy death, O graue, I wil be
thy deſtruction,</hi> Oſee, Chap. 13. verſe. 14.
Wherfore we do in this ſort diſtinguiſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
of his death from the benefites of his
reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. By his death ſinne is aboliſhed:
by his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> righteouſnes is reſtored:
by his death is death extinguiſhed: by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
is life repayred: to conclude, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
one, hel gates are broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp &amp; va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed, &amp; by
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dores of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are vnſhut &amp; opened
vnto vs. Theſe are the proper differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
his death &amp; reſurrection, although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
one ſometime is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, &amp; al things
are giuen and applied to his death whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
we inioy. Here may be a queſtion, why
Chriſt was three dayes in the ſepulchre.
Firſt I may ſay, It was to fulfill the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
for Ionas was a figure &amp; ſigne of his
reſurrection: now as Ionas was three daies
and three nightes in the fiſhes belly, ſo was
Chriſt in the graue. Agayne, hee was there
three dayes, and did not riſe by &amp; by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
after his death, to confirme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> certaintie
of his death, that he was dead in deede: for if
he ſhould haue riſen ſtraight way, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might
haue thought with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues that he had not
<pb facs="tcp:10917:55"/>
bin throughly dead. Againe, although it be
ſaid that he was three dayes and three nights
in the heart of the earth, yet was he there but
part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for the ſcripture doth take a part
&amp; halfe of a day for a whole day, as alſo part
of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wheras it is ſaide,
<hi>there were ſo many ſoules in the ſhip with
Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Actes 27. 37.</note> it is meant, ſo many men in al with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
&amp; ſoules: but the better, greater, &amp; excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenter
part is vſually taken for the whole, as
in this place of three daies. This article hath
two principall poynts to be conſidered in it:
firſt, the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelf of Chriſt, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the benefites y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> come vnto vs by it, which
are three in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. Firſt, life &amp; righteouſnes
is reſtored vnto vs by his riſing: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
&amp; newnes of life here amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men, is
taught vnto vs by this reſurrection: laſtly,
we are aſſured &amp; perſwaded of our reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
In that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt our head is riſen again,
we alſo the members ſhall riſe with him, as
Paul ſaith, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer Chriſt which is our
head ſhal appeare, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal we alſo appeare,
that is, riſe with him in glorie,</hi> (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is) <hi>a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
body as his is.</hi> Phil. 3. Coloſ. 3. This
can not be but great comfort vnto vs. As co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his reſurrection, partly ſome thing
was alledged before, &amp; teſtimonies brought
<pb facs="tcp:10917:55"/>
to confirme it, but this may be ſaide more of
it, that it is ſo neceſſarie to be beleeued vnto
ſaluation, that without it no life can be had:
for how can he haue life, that doth not, or wil
not beleeue the author &amp; giuer of life, Ieſus
Chriſt, to be aliue &amp; riſen, but dead? how (I
ſay) ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch an one haue any life in him at al?
Therefore our Sauiour, willing to leaue a
perpetuall memorie of this article to his
Church, ſeeing it was of ſuch great waight
&amp; importance, after that he had ſuffered, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
him ſelfe aliue to his Apoſtles &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
&amp; to the women alſo, by many infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
tokens, being ſeene of them by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace
of fourtie dayes, &amp; ſpeaking of thoſe things
which appertayne to the kingdome of God.
To this ende, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme &amp; ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this true reſurrection, he did eate
&amp; drinke w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them after he roſe, Acts. 10. ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his hands &amp; his feete, bid them han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
him, &amp; ſee that it was euen he and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Luk. 24. 39. Yea this point is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
to obteyne euerlaſting ſaluation, that
the Apoſtle S. Paul doth affirme, <hi>that if
Chriſt be not riſen againe, then is our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
in vayne, then is our faith in vayne,
then are we falſe witneſſes of God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are
we yet in our ſinnes, and they that are falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10917:56"/>
aſleepe <hi>in Chriſt are periſhed, and we of al
men are moſt miſerable.</hi> All theſe abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and inconueniences do follow, if we or
any other beleeue not ſtedfaſtly, that Chriſt
is riſen againe. But (dearly beloued) Chriſt
is riſen againe, as the Angel ſaid to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 6.</note>
                     <hi>He is riſen, he is not here,</hi> when they
thought hee had not bene riſen, but there in
the graue as hee was layde. The Phariſees
thought, that if they could perſwade the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from the beliefe of this his reſurrection,
they ſhould do well ynough with them, and
therfore they gaue large money to the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
to ſay that he was ſtollen away by his
diſciples by night. They wel knew that if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
people of the Iewes did beleeue this his ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead, they would eaſely beleeue
all other myſteries of his death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
with the articles going before. The
Euangeliſts al of them do inculcate &amp; make
mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of no one article ſo much as of this:
for although <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> doe make no
mention of his byrth &amp; conception, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
they make diligent rehearſall
of this reſurrection in their Goſpels, <hi>Marke</hi>
16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. The Apoſtles after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſcenſion
of Chriſt, did eſpecially preach this article to
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people in al ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; preachi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs of theirs.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:56"/>
Peter in fiue Sermons together, the 1. 2.
3. 4. 5. of the Actes of the Apoſtles, maketh
eſpeciall mention of this reſurrection. So
doth he in the Actes 10. And ſo doth Paul.
Act. 13. and 17. and in euery Epiſtle of his.
For in deede our whole faith dependeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, which if it be once ouerthrowen, then
can not our faith be ſure &amp; ſtable. Although
the Apoſtles were choſen to be witneſſes of
all the doings and actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Chriſt, Act. 10.
verſe. 39. yet were they eſpeciall witneſſes
of his reſurrection, becauſe it ſeemed ſo
incredible in the eyes of all men. For when
as Peter made his Sermon immediatly
after Chriſtes aſcenſion into heauen, in an
vpper chamber in Ieruſalem, to all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and to the women which were there.
which were in all, both men and women,
ſixe ſcore, hee made mention of this to the
reſt, that there muſt one be choſen into the
roume and place of Iudas the traytour, to
be made a witnes of Chriſtes reſurrection,
Act. 1. verſ. 22. So that, although not only,
yet eſpecially the office of the Apoſtles
was, to declare and teſtifie with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and boldnes, the reſurrection of
Chriſt, to the people and Church of God.
Belike then, this reſurrection of Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:10917:57"/>
doeth conteyne in it ſome notable myſterie,
and leſſon for our inſtruction: and ſurely
ſo it doeth. Seeing it is ſo, let vs come to
the ſeconde poynt which I noted, that was,
the benefite and great profite wee reape by
his reſurrection. This reſurrection was
great loſſe vnto Satan, but the ſame was
our gayne. For by it, death is ſwallowed
vp into victorie, and the bonds of the deuill,
whereby hee helde vs captiues at his will,
are all broken and daſhed in pieces, by this
victorious Lion of the tribe of Iuda. And
this is the firſt benefite, that eternall life,
which is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> free gift of God, Rom. 6. is now
giuen vnto vs. Then before this reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we were in the ſhadow of death, ſitting
in blindneſſe and ignorance. Nowe ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
is reſtored: then ſurely before, we
were in our ſinnes, as Paul ſaith, <hi>If Chriſt
bee not ryſen, then are you as yet in your
ſinnes, 1. Cor.</hi> 25. Well, nowe that he is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
all our ſinnes, are put away. Let vs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
this doctrine to our ſelues, for our owne
conſolation and comfort, agaynſt Satan
and all his tentations, and let vs ſay of it as
Paul did, Galat. 2. <hi>I am crucified with
Chriſt, but I liue,</hi> (meaning by his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection)
<hi>yet not I any more, but Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb facs="tcp:10917:57"/>
in me. And in that that I nowe liue in
the fleſh, I liue by the fayth in the Sonne
of God, who hath loued me, and giuen
him ſelfe for me.</hi> So muſt euery one of vs
ſay, Chriſt hath ryſen againe for me, &amp; iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
me, and ſaued me, in reſtoring life vnto
my dead body againe. Here ariſeth likewiſe
out of this, our duetie and thankefulneſſe to
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt for this great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
not to forget it at any time, but as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſayeth, Deut. 6. 6. ſo muſt wee doe: for
this is the precept and commaundement of
the eternall God, <hi>Theſe wordes</hi> or things
<hi>which I command thee this day, ſhall be
in thy heart, and thou ſhalt rehearſe them
continually vnto thy children, and ſhalt
talke of them when thou ſitteſt in thy
houſe, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou walkeſt by the way,
and when thou lyeſt downe, and as thou
ryſeſt vp.</hi> So theſe benefites of Chriſt are
alwayes to be remembred. Alas, dearely
beloued brethren, if we woulde ſo thanke
and remember a friende of ours but a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
man, as we woulde neuer forget him,
but ſpeake continually of him, and prayſe
him to others, if hee ſhoulde beſtowe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs a tranſitorie and temporall gift, which
laſteth but for a time, as a thouſande pound
<pb facs="tcp:10917:58"/>
in money or goods, or an hundred pounde
lande a yeere, if (I ſay) we would thinke
this very much, and great loue: what ſhall
wee thinke of Ieſus Chriſt, and howe
ſhall wee bee able to thanke him ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and remember him ynough, which
hath beſtowed vpon vs his owne goodes
and treaſures, farre better then ſiluer and
golde, and all precious ſtones, yea, to the
which theſe things are but doung? and not
onely hath he giuen vnto vs his goods and
iewels:but he hath alſo giuen vnto vs moſt
faire and large poſſeſſions, euen the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, immortall,
vndeſtled, and which withereth not away,
as theſe inheritances here belowe doe.
Theſe things come vnto vs by his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and yet who almoſt of the hundred
part of men remembreth theſe benefits, and
receiueth them with thankeſgiuing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly?
Nay, who thinketh not more of his
lands and poſſeſſions here belowe, then of
thoſe aboue? Wel, they are the more fooles
and mad men, and altogether vnthankefull
to our good and louing Sauiour Ieſus
Chriſt, which doeth offer theſe things vnto
them, if they woulde receiue them. God
make them and vs al, one day thankefull for
<pb facs="tcp:10917:58"/>
them. Well, to conclude this point, let vs
marke and beholde, that he is riſen againe
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, wherin did appeare greater force
and power, then if he had at that time come
downe from the croſſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iewes wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him ſo to doe: for he did ſo vanquiſh and
ouercome death, ſtriuing with him in the
graue, that hee was not able with all his
force, to keepe him vnder his rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.
If hee had bene ouercome, he
ſhould not haue ſaued vs. For it had bene al
one with vs, as with one ready to bee drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ſome other man to help and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
him, woulde couragiouſly leape into
the water, who in the ende ſhould be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him ſelfe, before he could releeue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
what help then could come to the man
that firſt fell into the water? Truely no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing could enſue of this, but one euill
to folowe an other, and the death of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
man, to be added to the loſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt.
But this was farre otherwiſe in Chriſt,
who firſt deliuered him ſelfe from the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of death and hell, that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
perſwade vs of our ſaluation, as a ſure
anker, by faith in him alone. The ſecond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
that commeth to vs by Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
is newnes of life, &amp; that we ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:10917:59"/>
mortifie our former: luſtes, in dying vnto
ſinne, and haue a newe life in all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and holineſſe, as we ſee Chriſt did riſe
againe with a glorified body, not ſubiect to
the like affections and paſſions as he was
before, to hunger and thirſt, to mortalitie
and other miſeries of the body, but had all
things as it were newe: ſo ſhoulde we alſo
ryſe with him from this olde life of ſinne,
wherein wee haue liued too long, and put
on a newe and a better life, that is, as Paul
ſpeaketh, <hi>to caſt off concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
in time paſt, that olde man
which is corrupted through the deceyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
luſtes: and that we ſhould be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the ſpirite of our minde, to put on
the newe man, which after God is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto ryghteouſneſſe and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
This is the true image wherein
Chriſt is ryſen, and wherein we muſt alſo
ryſe: For ſurely (dearely beloued) as Chriſt
was rayſed from the dead to the glory of the
Father, ſo we alſo ſhoulde walke in newe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of life, Rom. 6. Then all they that doe
not leade a newe life and a Chriſtian, haue
not yet riſen with Chriſt, neither haue they
part of his reſurrection. For we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that the ſcriptures of God do ſet forth
<pb facs="tcp:10917:59"/>
vnto vs two reſurrections: the one is of the
body at the generall daye of iudgement,
1. Corin. 15. Of this we ſhall heare more in
that article of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſurrection, &amp; this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all, and is in the life to come, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the ſeconde reſurrection, where of Iohn
ſpeaketh, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 20. The other reſurrection
is of the ſoule from ſinne, here in this life
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> elect and childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, which
are true members of Ieſus Chriſt, and
folowe him their head, and this is called the
firſt reſurrection, becauſe it goeth before
the other: and he that will haue his part of
the ſeconde reſurrection to life euerlaſting,
and not be hurt of the ſeconde death, muſt
while he liueth here, indeuour to ryſe from
ſinne. Of this reſurrection Saint Iohn in
the twentie of the Reuelation ſpake moſt
playnely, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed and holy is hee
that hath his part in the firſt reſurrection,
for on ſuch the ſecond death hath no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
but they ſhall be the Prieſtes of God
and of Chriſt, and reygne with him a
thouſand yeeres:</hi> that is to ſay, not a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande
onely, but for euer and euer, as
is moſt clearely in another place of the
ſame <hi>Iohn</hi> expounded, <hi>Chapter 22. verſe</hi>
5. in theſe wordes, <hi>The Lorde ſhall giue
<pb facs="tcp:10917:60"/>
them lyght, and they ſhall reigne for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore:</hi>
Which by the way maketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
the error of them, that imagined
that Chriſt ſhoulde reigne but a thouſande
yeere with his elect, and that vpon the earth
alſo. But to come to our matter againe,
from the which wee haue a litle digreſſed:
We ſee that there is alſo a reſurrection to
be ſought for here in this life, from ſinne.
Of this reſurrection ſpake S. Paul alſo
Epheſ. 5. ſpeaking to them that where fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
downe &amp; aſleepe, or rather dead in ſinne:
<hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtande vp
from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall giue thee
light.</hi> In this reſurrection from ſinne and
wickednes did <hi>Dauid</hi> ariſe, when hee had
ſlept, and was almoſt dead in adulterie, and
murder of <hi>Vrias,</hi> for the ſpace of one whole
yere and more: for when <hi>Nathan</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
came vnto him, and ſharply rebuked
him for it, he repented and amended, and ſo
roſe againe to a lewe life afterwarde. So
did Saint Peter alſo riſe in this reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when he had moſt wickedly and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
denied &amp; forſworſte his maſter Chriſt:
for he went forth and wept bitterly: So he
roſe againe, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. And ſo doe all the
godly:when they haue ſinned, they are ſory
<pb facs="tcp:10917:60"/>
for it, and by and by they ariſe by repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance,
and neuer intende to doe the like againe.
And verely ſo muſt we all doe, euery one of
vs from the hieſt to the loweſt, none muſt be
exempted, if we wil be Chriſts ſcholers and
diſciples, or haue any part with him in his
holy reſurrection. When we haue offended
our maſter Chriſt, let vs be moſt heartily ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
for it, lament and amendc, and ſerue him
better afterwarde, taking heede of the like
offences againe: then ſhall wee haue our
part in this reſurrection, &amp; ſo be bleſſed for
euer. Nowe the wicked and reprobate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
when they haue ſinned, they can not
ryſe agayne by repentance with <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Dauid,</hi> but rather lye ſtill vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of their ſinnes, and ſo fall to deſpayre:
therefore they can haue no fellowſhippe in
this reſurrection. As for example, wee ſee
in <hi>Cain,</hi> haw he diſpayred when he had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 14.</note>
and neuer repented or amended his
life, Gene. 4. So did <hi>Saul:</hi> and ſo did king
Pharao confeſſe he had ſinned vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord:
but yet he hardened his heart,<note place="margin">Exod. 8.8 and 9. 28.</note> and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſtill in his ſinnes to prouoke the Lorde,
for he would not let Iſrael goe to ſerue the
Lorde, who did not ryſe in this reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The like we haue of Eſau,<note place="margin">Gen. 27.38.</note> who wept in
<pb facs="tcp:10917:61"/>
deede, but not in <hi>godly ſorow that cauſeth
repentance vnto ſaluation, not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of,</hi> as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, 2. Cor.
7. But he lamented in <hi>worldly ſorowe,</hi> that
<hi>cauſeth death,</hi> becauſe he amended not his
ſinfull life, Hebrew. 12. The like may bee
ſayde of Iudas, who fell as others of the
godly dyd into ſinne, but roſe not agayne
with them. Therefore the reprobate, when
they fall away, can not ryſe, becauſe they
can not bee renewed by repentance, ſeeing
they crucifie to them ſelues the Sonne of
God, and make a mocke of him, as Iulian
that wicked Emperour &amp; runnagate from
Chriſt, after he fell away from him, neuer
came to him againe. For it was vnpoſſible
for him ſo to doe, as Paul ſayeth, Hebr. 6.
verſe 4, 5, 6. But here let vs behold the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
dealing of man, and the vanitie of his
heart, when he ſhoulde be riſen with Chriſt
in his reſurrection, he riſeth with the deuil
to the toppe of all ſinne and wickedneſſe:
when he ſhould be aliue in al good workes,
he is dead in them, and quicke in all abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations:
many riſe, but not with Chriſt to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
glory of God, but to their owne glory, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the worlde: ſome to promotions &amp; prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
by vniuſt and vnlawful meanes, ſome
<pb facs="tcp:10917:61"/>
to pride and ambition, ſome riſe early,
as Eſay, 5. Chapter ſayeth, <hi>But to followe
drunkenneſſe, and to practiſe their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
deuiſes, which they haue conceiued
in their beddes.</hi> Thus they riſe and haue a
reſurrection, but not in goodneſſe, but in
moſt filthie and abominable ſinne. For
where we ſhoulde be freſh and floriſhing as
good and greene trees, to bring forth good
fruite, left we be throwne downe and caſt
into the fire: we are dead &amp; withered, &amp; drie
in al goodnes, corrupt trees without fruite,
twiſe dead and plucked vp by the rootes.
This is a very miſerable thing, but yet
common to many. Wee ſee then by theſe
things, that the wicked liue in the thinges
wherein they ſhould dye, and die in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things
wherein they ſhould be aliue before God, as
faith, hope, and loue of God, and heauen and
heauenly things: ſo that we may iudge, that
as yet they haue not atteyned to this reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
which Chriſt hath gotten and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for vs by his riſing again. Wel, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this leſſon, <hi>let vs that are riſen with
Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe thinges that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue,
where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand
of God, and let vs ſet our affections vpon
heauenly thinges, and not earthly, for wee
<pb facs="tcp:10917:62"/>
are dead, and our life is hidde with
Chriſt in God,</hi> Coloſſians 3. verſ. 1. and ſo
let vs altogether mortifie our earthly mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and fleſhly luſtes, fornication, euil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
vncleannes, inordinate affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and couetouſnes, which is of all vices the
worſt, &amp; called Idolatrie: doing theſe things
in the firſt reſurrection, when Chriſt which
is our life ſhal appeare, then ſhall we alſo in
the ſeconde reſurrection appeare with him
in glory. The which aſſurance of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
is the thirde benefite, we haue to
note in this reſurrection of Chriſt: for by it
we are made ſurc and certaine of the ryſing
againe of our bodies at the laſt and generall
day of iudgement, when Chriſt ſhal come to
iudge all the worlde in righteouſnes. I ſay,
that his riſing is the earneſt of our immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie,
not onely in our ſoules, but alſo in
our bodyes.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>He is become the firſt fruits of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſleepe: and as in Adam we al die:
ſo again by Chriſt and his reſurrection, we
ſhal al be made aliue at the great and laſt
day,</hi> in as much as <hi>he is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the
life, and he that beleeueth in him, although
he were dead, yet ſhal hee liue,</hi> Iohn 11.
And hee is the head that is riſen, therefore
the body and all the members of the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:10917:62"/>
ſhal followe in due time. For as when a man
hath fallen into ſome deepe and dangerous
riuer, and hath nowe recouered his head
from vnder the water, and ſwimmeth aboue
out of danger with his head, although his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts &amp; members of his body be not yet
ſeene &amp; diſcouered, yet wil al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay, he is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
from death already: ſo is it with our
head Ieſus Chriſt, and with vs his body.
Seeing he is eſcaped and tiſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deepe
gulfe of death, (notwithſtanding wee ſeeme
as yet to be couered therein in this our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
ſtate) why may it not be iuſtly ſaide, that
we are riſen with him, being ſo neerely ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and vnited vnto him, vnleſſe we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
him to bee our head? Wherefore, if wee
profeſſe our ſelues to be his, wee muſt lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
acknowledge that our reſurrection is
already begun in his, &amp; that we do by hope,
(which neuer maketh aſhamed) in this life
retaine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſſurance of that ſtate, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
wee ſhall with ful poſſeſſion &amp; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
in heauen with him enioy for euer.
This can not bee but a great and ſingular
comfort to al the faithfull ſeruauntes of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, to conſider that their bodyes ſhal
not lie for euer in the graues, as the bodyes
of beaſtes do, but that they ſhall riſe againe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:63"/>
with Chriſt, which is before entred into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
to prepare a place there for vs, that hee
may come againe at the laſt day to receiue
vs wholy vnto him ſelfe. If wee were by
the death of any friende of ours, made ſure
by good and ſufficient warrant of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounde lande a yeere, howe greatly
woulde wee reioyce thereof both night and
day! And how ought we to reioyce continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
beyng put in aſſurance by Chriſtes
death and reſurrection, not of landes and
goodes here, which are but ſhort and tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie:
but of the poſſeſſion of the euerlaſting
and immortall kingdome of God, where
are pleaſures without ende, and ioyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any wearineſſe. O howe ought this to
ſtirre vs vp to be in loue with that life, but
eſpecially and aboue all things to loue him,
that was the authour and purchaſer of theſe
things vnto vs, euen Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne
of God, both God and man! I woulde to
God we did thinke of theſe thinges and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
deepely with our ſelues, what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for vs by his reſurrection: ſurely then
wee woulde not ſinne, at the leaſt we would
not wallo we with the ſowe, and delite in our
ſinnes as many men do, the more is the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Wel, this is the greateſt benefite we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
<pb facs="tcp:10917:63"/>
by this reſurrection, euen our owne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing:
if it were not for this, we were not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bruite beaſtes, yea farre worſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the godly, who ſuffer many iniuries
and tauntes, with mockings and paynes of
the wicked: if they ſhoulde not be aſſured of
this grace and happineſſe, their life were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
miſerable, &amp; they ſurely would deſpaire.
But of theſe things which are very incident
to the article of our reſurrection, mo things
(by Gods grace) ſhal be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we come
to that point. In the meane ſeaſon (dearely
beloued) let vs giue to Ieſus Chriſt moſt
humble and heartie thankes, for the benefits
that we receiue of his gratious goodnes, by
his victorious reſurrection, in that hee hath
gotten to vs life, and opened the gates of
paradiſe vnto vs, which were ſhutte before.
And with all, becauſe we neede continually
to craue many thinges at his handes, let vs
meekely pray vnto him, that hee woulde
vouchſafe to woorke ſo in our harde heartes
by his holy ſpirit, that we may by his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
mortifie and kil all the wicked &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
deſires of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh, &amp; other ſinnes which
are crept into vs, and beg we of him, that we
may all of vs, leaue the olde finfull life of
Adam, and walke in a newe life, and put on
<pb facs="tcp:10917:64"/>
the newe man Ieſus Chriſt, and to make
no prouiſion for the vnbrydled fleſh, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
the luſtes of it, that we may walke before
him, and ſerue him, not for a day, or weeke,
or moneth, or yere,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 75.</note> but as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt ſaith,
<hi>al the dayes &amp; times of our life, in holineſſe

conſolation and comfort of our own ſoules,
which God graunt vs for his ſonnes ſake:

To ſit at Gods right hande,<note place="margin">What it is to ſit at Gods right hand.</note> is to haue, and
to be aboue <hi>all rule, power, might and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
&amp; euery name that is named, not
onely in this world, but alſo in the worlde
to come, Ephe.</hi> 1. It is then as our ſauiour
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. and 28. <hi>To haue all
things giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him, al authoritie, both in
heauen and in earth.</hi> For the right hand of
God, ſignifieth the euerlaſting and infinite
power of God. Wee muſt not thinke, that
God being an infinite &amp; moſt bleſſed ſpirit,<note place="margin">Iohn 1. 18. and 4. 24.</note>
and not a body, hath either right hand or
lefte, eyes or armes, or ſuch like partes and
members of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s body:but when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
giueth theſe properties &amp; ſpeaches vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, (as it doth often) it is for our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and capacitie, which are children and
babes in Gods matters, &amp; therfore can not
vnderſtand him in his maieſtie ſpeaking to
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnles he liſpe (as it were) vnto vs, like a
nurce vnto her young children. For we are
ſo groſſe, that we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Lord is angry with ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his ſinne
&amp; wickednes, vnles he ſpeake after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner
of men, &amp; ſay, he repenteth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer he made
<pb facs="tcp:10917:66"/>
man. Againe we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not, or conceiue
his wonderfull power and ſtrength, except
it be by a great and mighty and ſtretched
out arme or hande. So by the eyes of the
Lord is meant his carefull &amp; vigilant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
&amp; foreſight ouer all his creatures,
and by his countenance is moſt commonly
meant his terrible wrath and anger. When
the ſcripture giueth an eare to God, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the preachers ſaye in their Sermons, that
he hath an eare: you muſt vnderſtand that
he heareth all things bee they neuer ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
ſpoken of any man, as by his eye, hee
ſeeth al things in this world, although they
be neuer ſo much hid, and done in darke &amp;
ſecret places, as the wicked doe their euill
workes. As we ſee then that kings and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men do place at their right hande, ſuch
as are either their betters, or equals, or doe
gouerne in their ſteade, ſo is it here: Chriſt
is exalted and placed in that dignitie &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that his father is, becauſe he is equall
vnto him. And this latter part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> article,
to <hi>ſit at Gods right hand,</hi> being in the laſt
chapter of <hi>Marke,</hi> from whence it ſeemeth
this was taken, <hi>S. Paul</hi> doth expounde very
well in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 1. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> that <hi>God hath ſet him
farre aboue all principalitie and power, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:10917:67"/>
might and domination.</hi> And in an other
place, <hi>Philip. 2. hath highly exalted him,
and giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him a name aboue euery name,
that at the name of Ieſus ſhoulde euery
knee bowe, both of things in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and
things in earth, &amp; things vnder the earth,
and that euery tongue ſhoulde confeſſe
that Ieſus Chriſt is the Lorde, vnto the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God the father.</hi> This is the meaning
of theſe words, <hi>he ſitteth at the right hand
of God.</hi> It is not of any corporall ſitting,
for it may as wel be ſayd, <hi>that he ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth at
the right hand of God:</hi> For ſo did <hi>Saint
Stephen</hi> ſee him, <hi>Actes</hi> 7. Therefore both
by ſitting and ſtanding there, is meant, that
he is aduaunced to great glorie, as hath
bene ſayde already. And here in this his
aſcenſion, ſo glorious is his kingdome to
be ſeene, which hee did not take vpon him
here in the earth. So that although Chriſt
did ſhewe great glorie in his reſurrection,
all mortalitie being layde away, yet by his
aſcenſion into heauen, hee hath more nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
declared his power: for now he gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
all things, and ruleth as a king ouer
all the earth. And this doeth the Apoſtle
teache vs, that <hi>he aſcended farre aboue all
heauens, to fulfill all things.</hi> For we ſee, and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:67"/>
reade how aboundantly, and moſt miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
he powred downe his holy ſpirit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. howe he hath increaſed
his church and kingdome in euery part of
the earth, how he hath euer ſince his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
mightily defended his, &amp; ſharply pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
his enemies. So that although he be
in heauen according to his bodily preſence,
and not in earth (as the <hi>Lutheranes</hi> &amp; <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes</hi>
do imagine him to be in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
contrary to this article, <hi>he aſcended,</hi>
which is to be meant only of his body, &amp; not
of his diuine nature, which doeth fill all
things, &amp; needeth not to deſcend or aſcend:)
yet (I ſay) Chriſt is with vs, as hee him ſelfe
ſaith, <hi>euen vnto the end of the world, Mat.</hi>
28. 19. by his power &amp; ſpirit, &amp; by his grace
and godhead, which is euery where. For
he ſayeth, that <hi>he will not leaue vs father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
but will come vnto vs:</hi> which he meant
by ſending his ſpirit, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. We are not
then to looke for Chriſtes body here nowe
vpon the earth, (as certaine heretikes do
ſuppoſe) euen as he him ſelfe ſaith, <hi>Matt.
26. Me ſhal you not haue alwayes.</hi> Surely
this ſaying can by no meanes be true, if his
body be euery where, in euery place, at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſacrament: then is not his body departed
<pb facs="tcp:10917:68"/>
from vs, then is he not aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
but remaineth here ſtill in the earth.
But the Angell ſayde to the women, <hi>that
he was not there.</hi> That was ſome place, &amp;
then he had a glorified body. And it is ſaid,
that <hi>heauen muſt conteine him, vntill all
things bee reſtored, Act.</hi> 3. Surely being
now aſcended in body, we neither reade of,
nor beleeue any other deſcenſion in body,
then that wherein he ſhall deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to iudge
at the latter day: as the Angels ſpake to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
diſciples, <hi>This Ieſus which is taken vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
you into heauen, ſhall ſo come, as ye haue
ſeene him go into heauen.</hi> So that vnles
we ſee Chriſt ſo come down as he went vp,
we will not beleeue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papiſtes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſay he is
in the boxe or pixe, much leſſe them that ſay,
he is euery where, making him in deede to
haue no body at all, but altogether ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
vp by his diuinitie. For tell mee, I
pray you, if Chriſt had mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his body ſhould
alway remaine here vpon the earth, why
did he ſay that he muſt depart from them?
They cannot meane it of his diuinity, but of
his humanitie. Againe, what needed his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to bee ſo ſorowefull for his going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
if they had had his body with them?
Here they anſwere, The diſciples had not
<pb facs="tcp:10917:68"/>
his body viſibly, but his body inuiſible or
not ſeene. But ſurely the diſciples, if they
had vnderſtoode it ſo, as the Papiſtes ſay,
of his inuiſible body, they were not ſuch
children, but that they would haue conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them ſelues, as well with his inuiſible
body, as his inuiſible ſpirit, and grace after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes:
therfore they would needes know
howe they ſhould be comforted when hee
was gone from them. Chriſt told them, by
his ſpirite, although inuiſible, and not by
his body inuiſible, which ſurely would haue
comforted them, although they ſaw it not,
if it had then bene with them, as his ſpirite
was: but Chriſt meant no ſuch thing, and
therefore promiſed euer his ſpirit to them,
and all others after, and not his inuiſible
body. This is a plaine caſe, but I leaue to
diſcourſe of it any further, becauſe I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
in this booke to edifie and inſtruct the
ſimple readers, onely in the poyntes of
Chriſtianitie, concerning their faith, and
not to make any treatiſe for the learned.
Seeing then wee haue a great hie Prieſt,
which is entred into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen Ieſus the
ſonne of God, let vs hold faſt our profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
as the Apoſtle ſayth, and let vs goe boldly
vnto the throne of grace, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
<pb facs="tcp:10917:69"/>
mercie, and finde grace to helpe
in time of neede. For this was the third
point, that I ſayde was to be obſerued of
vs, to weigh with our ſelues, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and commodity thereby doeth enſue
to all the faythfull, that hee is in heauen.
Surely, this cannot be but great comfort
to al the faithful: for they all are aſſured by
Chriſtes aſcenſion, that they alſo ſhall one
day, euen at the reſurrection of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
aſcende with him: for he is gone to
prepare a place for them, as he teſtifieth in
<hi>Iohn. 14. I goe to prepare a place for you,
and if I goe to prepare a place for you, I
will come agayne, and receyue you vnto
my ſelfe, that where I am, there may ye
be alſo.</hi> Chriſt by his aſcenſion hath ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the gates and doores of heauen, and
Paradiſe for vs, which were ſhut againſt
vs before, ſo that wee had no entrance
thither. For this is moſt certayne and
true, that if the head be there, then ſhall
the body and members be there alſo:
and if our captayne be there, then ſhall his
ſouldiers, which are we, be one day with
him, and the maſter will haue there his
ſeruantes to wayte and attend vpon him
in his houſe. And to be ſhort, ſeeing Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:10917:69"/>
is in heauen, he wil haue his true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to be with him. Is not this a great
comfort in all troubles, and hurlyburlies
in this life, to meditate vpon this, that one
day we ſhall come into the preſence of our
louing Maſter Ieſus Chriſt? Surely this
would comfort any poore afflicted ſoule or
body, if he did remember it: but we forget
it, and then what ioy can wee haue in this
vale of miſerie? This comforted Dauid in
his baniſhment, ſaying, <hi>When ſhal I come
to appeare before the preſence of God?</hi>
This reioyced Paul greatly, when he ſayd,
<hi>A crowne of righteouſneſſe is layde vp
for me in that day, when the Lord ſhal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
2. Timothie</hi> 4. So then, this is the
firſt, and one of the greateſt benefites, that
by Chriſtes aſcenſion, wee haue an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of our owne. <hi>For when Chriſt
ſhall appeare, then ſhall we alſo appeare
with him in glory, Coloſsians</hi> 3. But
yet wee muſt remember, that as Chriſt
firſt ſuffered ſhame and reproche, and
bitter death alſo, and ſo in the ende
entred into heauen, by diuers croſſes
and calamyties, ſo muſt wee alſo for
the moſt part, enter in the ſame way
with him: for by many tribulations muſt
<pb facs="tcp:10917:70"/>
we enter into the kingdome of heauen, and
all that wil liue godly in Ieſus Chriſt, ſhal
ſuffer perſecution. For you knowe that the
ſeruant muſt not looke to be better han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his maſter, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcholer, to be in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
caſe then his teacher, nor we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt.
Againe, Chriſt by his aſcenſion doth ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
al our ſutes, cauſes, matters &amp; iniuries,
which we ſuffer, to God his father. For hee
is our Atturney, &amp; pleadeth for vs, as Iohn
ſayth, <hi>If any man ſinne, we haue an aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with the father, Ieſus Chriſt the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>
Is it not a great comfort to a poore
man, that can not make friendes, or come
vp to the prince, becauſe of coſts and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
to haue alway one of the priuy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
to helpe and further his ſutes as readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and diligently, as if hee were there him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?
So ſurely it is with vs: wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
Ieſus Chriſt at hand with God his
father, being of his moſt priuy and ſecrete
counſell, to make requeſtes to God for vs
continually, to pardon our ſinnes, to grant
vs grace and all other thinges neceſſary.
This is ſingular ioy to a godly heart, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
wee neede not to ſeeke any other Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
as the Papiſtes doe, as if hee were
not ſufficient of him ſelfe, or as mercifull
<pb facs="tcp:10917:70"/>
to heare vs, as his mother, or Peter, or any
other ſaynt in heauen. This is their folly,
and madnes: let vs be contented with
our only Mediatour Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe
he is moſt able, and moſt willing to heare
vs, yea biddeth vs to come to him for our
cauſes, <hi>Matthewe 11. Come vnto me all
ye that trauell and are laden, and I will
refreſhe you.</hi> Therefore we may boldly
and ſafely goe vnto him in our neede and
neceſſitye, and feare not. Which of vs is it,
that if the prince did byd vs come at the
firſt to her, and not to any other of her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy
chamber, but would come moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
and be glad ſo to do? Why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come
wee not to God at the firſt, ſaying in
his worde. <hi>Cal vpon me, in the day of thy
trouble, and I will heare thee?</hi> Why come
wee not to Chriſt, that ſo louingly biddeth
euery one of vs? Wel, let vs holde this for
an vnfallible principle: Chriſt being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
is our onely ſpokeſman, neither
let any man thinke, that it is with Ieſus
Chriſt, the king of all kings, as it is with
princes of the earth, that becauſe he is ſo hie
and in ſo great dignitie and maieſtie, hee
doth not therefore regarde, or reſpect vs
here vpon the earth ſo lowe: nay, Dauid
<pb facs="tcp:10917:71"/>
telleth vs the contrary, and meeteth with
this obiection: for hee ſayth, <hi>In deede the
Lorde is hie aboue al nations, and his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
aboue the heauens.</hi> But yet hee ſayeth,
<hi>that he abaſeth himſelf to behold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things
in heauen and in earth: yea, he rayſeth the
needy out of the duſt, &amp; lifteth the poore
out of the dounghill, to ſet him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> princes,
Pſal.</hi> 113. So we ſee, although the Lord be
hye, yet he hath reſpect vnto the lowly. And
Ieſus Chriſt, notwithſtanding he be in all
pleaſure, &amp; bleſſednes, yet he thinketh vpon
vs, becauſe he hath ſometyme felt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> like mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
with vs: &amp; we haue ſuch an hie Prieſt,
that can be touched with our infirmities,
euen at this time alſo, as he ſayde to Paul
perſecuting his ſayntes, <hi>Saul, Saul, why
doeſt thou perſecute me?</hi> Chriſt counted
himſelfe then to be perſecuted, although he
were in heauen, becauſe his poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
were afflicted, <hi>Actes.</hi> 9. In deede prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
here, and noble men with vs many
tymes knowe not the miſery of others, nay
regarde it not, becauſe they haue neuer felt
the like ſmart, and knowe not what hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or thirſt, or nakednes, or impriſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment,
or baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or lacke of lodging meaneth,
not hauing ſuffered the like themſelues.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:71"/>
But (I ſay) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſe is farre otherwiſe with
Chriſt, who knoweth better what we lack,
then we our ſelues doe, and hath borne the
like burden with vs, and doeth not forget
vs nowe in his glory and honor, as many
do their poore friends, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to any promotion &amp; dignitie by others.
Wherefore as Ioſeph in all his rioltie and
glory, remembred &amp; did acknowledge his
poore brethren before Pharao, and all his
houſe: ſo doeth vndoubtedly our Sauiour
Chriſt thinke vpon vs, his poore brethren,
ſaying, <hi>I will declare thy name vnto my
brethren, and he wil not be aſhamed to
confeſſe vs in heauen before his father,
and all his holy Angels.</hi> For howe ſhould
the head be aſhamed of his body, or the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of his wife? Chriſt is not aſhamed of
vs his ſpirituall kinred, as we are aſhamed
of our kindred many times, when we are
exalted aboue them: nay, hee is neuer aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of vs, vnleſſe wee be firſt aſhamed
of him. For then in deede hee ſayth, <hi>Hee
that is aſhamed of me and my ſayings
here in earth before men, I wil alſo be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
of him in heauen before my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and he that ſhal denye him here, hee
<pb facs="tcp:10917:72"/>
wil deny him there: but hee that ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
him here, he will confeſſe him there.
Mar.</hi> 8. Furthermore we are to vnderſtand,
that although Chriſt by his aſcenſion hath
taken away his body from the earth, which
was not neceſſary for vs, yet he hath left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Churche, and giuen vnto it, as a
moſt ſure and firme pledge, and earneſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his good will towardes vs, his holy
ſpirit alway crying in our heartes, Father,
father, &amp; working in vs, that which is good
&amp; acceptable in his ſight. This is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
comfort that may be to the faythful in
this lyfe, and therefore is this ſpirit often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
called by our ſauiour Chriſt, The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.
And this great and ſingular benefit
we haue by his aſcenſion: for he ſayde, that
vnleſſe hee went his way from them, the
comforter would not come, but if he went,
he would ſend him, as in deede he did after
his aſcenſion moſt plentifully, and doeth
at this day vnto his giue his ſpirit, either
in greater or leſſer meaſure, to ſome more,
to ſome leſſe, as hee thinketh good. This
benefite then doe wee enioy by his bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſence, departing for a time from vs.
This gift is to our ſoules, the fountayne of
life, and the very welſpring &amp; beginning
<pb facs="tcp:10917:72"/>
of all our Chriſtian regeneration and newe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in Chriſt, and ſo is called the ſpirit of
Adoption, becauſe it is proper to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and none other. This ſpirit doth leade
vs into al trueth, mortifieth our euil deedes,
killeth ſinne in vs, reuiueth all goodneſſe
within vs, maketh vs merry in the Lorde,
reioyceth vs in troubles, and doeth neuer
leaue vs deſtitute altogether of ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
or other. For this pledge out of our
hearts can neuer be taken away, all other
worldly things may be taken away, as from
Iob they were, who loſt his goods &amp; lands,
wife, friendes and children: his bodye was
afflicted, his ſoule tormented, yet in the

of this ſpirite, in that he coulde ſay in fayth,

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, if not in body, yet in ſoule, in minde
<pb facs="tcp:10917:73"/>
and heart, and all our affections. For where
our treaſure is, there ſhoulde our hear the
alſo. Our treaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and only treaſure Chriſt
Ieſus is in heauen, therefore let our hearts
he wholy with him, as Paul ſaith, <hi>Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation

looke for the Lord Ieſus, who ſhall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme
our vile body, that it may be made
like to his glorious body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Phil.</hi> 3. So that
as wee haue to learne by Chriſtes reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a ſpirituall reſurrection here in this
life from ſinne: In like ſort we learne alſo
by theſe wordes of Saint Paul, an holy
and ſpirituall aſcenſion into heauen by our
deſires and thoughts, that we may ioyne to
him euen nowe in fayth and ſpirite, till wee
all meete in body there at the faſt day. And
truely if we coulde keepe our mindes ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
vp into heauen, it woulde be very
benificiall for vs, and ridde vs out of many
daungers. Wee ſee and learne by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that the byrde is neuer inſnared and
caught of the fouler, vntill he lyght and ſit
vpon the earth: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he falleth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground,
then is hee ſubiect to gunſhatte, or other
ſnares and daungers. So it is with vs: if
our mindes were fixed aboue, vpon heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, Satan coulde not take vs in his
<pb facs="tcp:10917:73"/>
trappes, but when they are altogether caſt
downewarde vpon the earth, and earthly
pleaſures, then we fall into his baytes, and
are entangled in his grennes. Therefore
as Chriſt is aſcended, ſo let vs alſo aſcende
in minde &amp; cogitation vnto him: for Chriſt
doeth bidde vs tome vnto him, and this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtandeth in his full force nowe, as it did

<pb facs="tcp:10917:74"/>
So that wee may boldly ſaye as Dauid
ſayde ſometime, <hi>The Lorde is our ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde:
yea, the Lorde Ieſus is our King,
therefore ſhall wee lacke nothing.</hi> For
tel me I pray you, what good thing can we
want, Chriſt being our heauenly King,
and hauing nowe all power and authoritie
giuen vnto him, and ſitting at the ryght
hand of the almightie Father? Surely his
ſeruantes ſhall enioy all things, as he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
He that ouercommeth ſhall inherit all
things, and who is he that ouercommeth,
but Ieſus Chriſt, in whome we by his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and vertue ouercome alſo? that as
hee is made heyre of all things, ſo myght
wee alſo bee made ioynt heyres with him.
Wherefore wee knowe Chriſt no more in
his mortalitie, and humilitie. <hi>Yea although
wee had knowen Chriſt after the fleſh,
yet hence foorth knowe we him no more
after the fleſh, but after the woorking of
his myghtie Spirite, whereby hee is able
to ſubdue all things to him ſelfe, Philip.</hi> 3.
For here we muſt conſider, that Chriſt hath
thus aſcended into glorie for vs, and hath
receyued giftes for men, euen great ſpoyles
of the enemies, to enrich his Church. This
is our reioycing which wee haue dayly in
<pb facs="tcp:10917:75"/>
Chriſt Ieſus: here is the ioy, patience, and
victorie of the Saints of God, for he muſt
reigne, vntill hee hath put all his enemies
vnder his feete. Who then can he diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with any thing that befalleth vnto him,
eyther of bodie, or griefe of minde, or loſſe
of goods and friends? Is it not Chriſt that
dyed for vs, and which is ryſen againe,
who is alſo at the ryght hande of God, and
maketh requeſt for vs? Who ſhall ſay any
thing vnto our charge? who ſhal condemne
vs? If Chriſt be on our ſide, as hee is moſt
certaynely, being our head, who then can
bee agaynſt vs? howe can wee ſacke any
thing in this lyfe, when God hath giuen
his Sonne for vs? What man or woman
woulde thinke to lacke any thing earthly,
that had a King to his Father, or a Prince
to bee his brother? and ſhall wee bee of
ſo litle fayth, to thinke that wee can lacke
ought, hauing GOD the great King
ouer al the world, to be our louing Father,
and Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, the Prince
of all princes to bee our owne brother?
This were madneſſe to thinke or conceiue:
but yet if wee bee wauering through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulitie,
let vs ſaye and waye with the
man in the Goſpel, Lorde helpe my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe:
<pb facs="tcp:10917:75"/>
and with the Apoſtles let vs
ſaye, Lorde increaſe our fayth in vs, and
make it ſtrong agaynſt all tentations of
Satan. Seeing then that Ieſus Chriſt
is of that power, that he is able to bring
to paſſe all thinges, Gods children may
aſſure them ſelues of a ſingular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
agaynſt all their enemies. <hi>For who
ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt?
Shall tribulation, or anguiſh, or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
or famine, or nakedneſſe, or
peryll, or ſworde? Nay (dearely beloued)
I am certaynely perſwaded, that neither
death, nor life, nor angels, nor principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
nor powers, nor thinges preſent,
nor thinges to come, nor heyght, nor
depth, nor any other creature ſhall bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſeparate vs from the loue of GOD,
which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lorde: for in
all theſe thinges wee are more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours
through him that loued vs, and
this is our Chriſt that ſitteth in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
for vs.</hi> By this his glorie and power
euer ſince his aſcending, hee hath mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
the eſtate and welfare of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and will doe to the ende of the
worlde. The laſt thing wee learne by
Chriſtes aſcenſion, is this, that he is alſo
<pb facs="tcp:10917:76"/>
aſcended to leade captiuitie captiue, that
is to ſay, to beate downe and ouerthrowe
all his foes, and ſuch as ryſe vp heere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
him: ſo that as his power is a great
comfort to his ſpouſe, ſo it is as great a
terrour and griefe to the wicked repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
to thinke or to conſider of it. For it
maketh them to frette and fume, and to
bee euer at their wittes ende for ſorowe
and griefe, that hee muſt ouercome in ſpite
of their teeth. Then wee learne, that our
enemies ſhall not alway tryumph ouer vs,
they ſhall not ſtill haue vs in their bandes,
in pryſon and thraldome, but one day they
ſurely them ſelues ſhall come to confuſion
and ſhame. The Scriptures, when they
will paynt out Chriſt vnto vs in mercie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
his Church, they giue him the name
of a meeke and gentle Lambe, apparelled
in white, making no ſturre or cry in the
ſtreetes, not breaking a bruſed reede, nor
quenching a ſmoking fla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, Matthewe 12.
But when the Prophets will ſette foorth
Chriſt in his maieſtie and glorie, after his
aſcenſion, they giue him the name and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie
of a fierce Lion, all apparelled in
redde and bloody garmentes, with a rodde
<pb facs="tcp:10917:76"/>
and ſcepter of iron in his hande to rule and
gouerne all nations. And this no doubt is,
to cauſe &amp; make the enemies of his Church
to quake, euen as hee ſhewed him ſelfe in a
viſion to Saint Iohn his beloued diſciple,
to comfort him no doubt, but to terrifie the
enemies which were ſhortly to goe about to
deſtroy the Church of God. Wee reade in
the Reuelation 1. cha. that as Iohn turned
backe to heare the voyce that ſpake w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him,
Chriſt ſhewed him ſelfe vnto him in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,
as he was able to conceiue: <hi>for he ſaw
ſeuen golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> candleſticks, &amp; in the midſt of
the ſeuen golden candleſticks, one like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſonne of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, clothed with a garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
downe to the feete, and girded about the
pappes with a golden girdle: his head and
heares were white as white wooll, and as
ſnowe, and his eyes were as a flame of fire,
and his feete lyke vnto fine braſſe, burning
as in a furnace, and his voyce as the ſound
of many waters, and he had in his ryght
hand ſeuen ſtarres, and out of his mouth
went a ſharpe two edged ſwoorde, and
his face ſhone as the Sunne ſhyneth in
his ſtrength.</hi> This viſion of Chriſt in his
glorie was ſo fearefull, that it made Iohn
him ſelfe afrayde, but the Lorde dyd ſhewe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:77"/>
him ſelfe ſo, to comforte his ſeruauntes
which ſhould ſuffer perſecution a litle after,
but to threaten the enemies by his mightie
power. This is that which the holy Ghoſt
ſpake long ſince by Dauid, <hi>The Lorde
reigneth, let the people tremble, hee fitteth
betweene the Cherubims, let the earth be
mooued, the Lorde is great in Zion, and
he is hie aboue all people. The Lorde
that is at thy ryght hande, ſhall wounde
Kings in the day of his wrath, he ſhall bee
iudge among the heathen, he ſhall fill all
with dead bodyes, and ſmite the heades
ouer great countreys.</hi> Here wee ſee howe
Dauid ſpeaketh moſt magnificently of
this glorious kingdome of Chriſt, beyng
nowe exalted aboue the heauens by his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion:
howe hee aſſureth the enemies of
deſtruction, but promiſeth deliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>erie to the
godly in the Church. As Chriſt did alwayes
deliuer his Church, euen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
Noah from the flood, drowning the
reſt, Lot from Sodome, when hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
the remnant with fire, the Iſraelites
from the bondage of Egypt, and the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of king Pharao, ouerthrowing his
euennes in the redde ſea, for Chriſt was that
<pb facs="tcp:10917:77"/>
great Angel that went before them: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in deſtroying the Aſſyrians ſo many
thouſandes in one nyght, and ſauing good
king Hezekia and the reſt, ſo did hee moſt
wonderfully deſtroy great Babylon, and
ranſome thence his owne priſoners: finally,
howe he deſtroyed the Edomites, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,
the Moabites, the Philiſtims, and
the Canaanites, they that reade the hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bible, ſhal wel perceiue: as (I ſay)
Chriſt hath done theſe thinges to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
before his incarnation, ſo eſpecially
after hee was receyued vp in glorie, hee
hath done the like. Howe mightily did hee
ſuppreſſe and beate downe the great rage
and furie of Saul, beyng armed and ſette
as a fierce Tyger, or Lion, to deſtroy both
man, woman and childe of Chriſts flocke?
But the Lorde Ieſus from heauen ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
him, and made him as tame as a
Lambe, Actes 9. Did hee not cutte off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke
ſort that cruell tyraunt Herode, that
killed Iames, &amp; had alſo taken Peter? It is
ſayd, that in his pryde he gaue not GOD
the honour and glorye, and therefore was
immediatly ſtrooken of the angel, and moſt
ſhamefully eaten vp of wormes, Actes 12.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:78"/>
Howe Iulian the Emperour, that wicked
forſaker and perſecutour of the Chriſtians,
was handled by the iuſtice of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his life miſerably. So Zomenus in
in his ſixt booke of his ſtorie, the ſeconde
Chapter, doeth ſufficiently declare, that
he was not killed by any of his enemies, but
by one of his owne ſouldyers: And when
he was ſtrooken with the darte, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to death, hee vnderſtoode well the cauſe
of it to bee, for perſecuting Chriſt and the
Chriſtians: for hee tooke the blood out of
his wounde, and flang it vp into the ayre,
as if hee had ſeene Chriſt, and accuſed him
of his death, as in deede hee was the chiefe
authour of it, to puniſhe that wicked repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
which had ſo before contemned and
mocked his worde and Goſpel. They that
liſt to reade hiſtories, either prophane or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,
ſhall ſee howe the tyrantes, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Emperours of Chriſtes Church,
haue bene by Ieſus Chriſt in his glory ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
miſerably out of this life. Conſider all
the Emperours of Rome that perſecuted
the Church, what became of them, and howe
they dyed. Was not Nero that monſter,
partly by himſelfe, and partly by one of his
owne men, thruſt through with a dagger,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:78"/>
as Suetonius, and others do report? Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,
Otho, and Vitellius, did they not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the like? Did not Domitian deſtroy
his owne brother Titus, and poiſoned him?
and was not Titus a perſecuter of the
Iewes? Domitian was miſerably kylled
by one Stephanus his man, Maximinus
ſlayne by his owne armye, Commodus
kylled of Narciſſus, Macrinus thruſt tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
by his ſouldiers, Decius killed by
his enemies, Valerianus pearſed with a
ſpeare of the Perſians, Pilate after hee
had crucified our Sauiour Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
fewe yeeres after, was hee not dryuen
to hang him ſelfe for ſorowe, as Iudas
did before him? Diocleſian and Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,
which were the authours of the tenth
and laſt perſecution agaynſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
depoſed them ſelues of their imperial
function, by the ſecrete iudgement of God.
Maxentius the ſonne of Maximinian,
dranke of the ſame cuppe with Pharao, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both like enemies againſt Chriſt and
his Church: for Maxentius was drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the water with his harneſſe vpon
his backe. The Popes of Rome, being
as great perſecutours as euer were any,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:79"/>
of Chriſt and his Church, many of them
haue had very wretched and ſhamefull
endes. Alexander the ſixt, was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with the deuill, by whome he aſpyred
to the papacie. Looke vpon our papiſtes in
Queene Maries dayes, and ſee howe a
great many of them dyed. Wee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>acke not
examples among vs euen freſh in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in thoſe dayes. <hi>Let a men conſider with
himſelfe, the vnhappie and vnfortunate
endes of the laſt race of the kinges in
Fraunce, and he ſhall ſay, that Chriſt euen
in his glory doth marueilouſly defende
his Goſpel, with the profeſſours thereof,
&amp; rewardeth their enemies according to
their deſertes.</hi> So that a man may iuſtly
ſay and confeſſe with Dauid, <hi>Doubtees
there is a God that iudgeth in the earth,</hi>
ſurely there is a Chriſt that defendeth his
Church: <hi>for hee ſhall treade downe our
enemies vnder vs, and deſtroy them that
riſe vp againſt vs, Pſalme.</hi> 60. By theſe
examples then we may haue comfort &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
our ſelues that are the litle ſtocke of
Chriſt, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> as he hath done already, ſo he will
doe alway for his: for he is able ſtill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his
hande is not ſhortned, but as long as it was,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:79"/>
neyther is he chaunged. And let vs with
Peter ſay and beleeue, <hi>that the Lorde
knoweth to deliuer the godly out of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and to reſerue the vniuſt vnto the
day of iudgement vnder puniſhment.</hi> I
woulde admoniſh therefore the wicked,

of Chriſtes Goſpel, to learne to

and not to goe on ſtil to prouoke and kindle

thinges that wee haue to beare in minde
vpon this article of our faith, concerning
Chriſt his aſcenſion. The firſt poynt was
of the aſcenſion it ſelfe, not into the
ayre or cloudes, but into heauen, proued by
the manifeſt woorde of God, the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
the ſeconde, the glory and power of
it, ſhewing the ende of it, which was, to ſitte
at Gods right hande, to gouerne all things:
the thirde poynt was the great aſſurance of
fayth that commeth to vs by it, and the
comfort that we conceiue by his ſo glorious
aſcenſion into heauen for vs. Nowe let vs

Chriſt, in giuing him firſt moſt heartie and

and let vs pray vnto him, that as hee is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
alreadie in body, ſo we in the meane

And ſeeing he is made gouernour of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

reaſon and iuſtice, that it ſhould be openly
ſeene and perceiued of all men at the laſt,
leſt either the wiſedome of the fleſh or ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
reaſon, or the multitude of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked ſhould
be able iuſtly to charge vs (as they do moſt
vniuſtly) that we faine to our ſelues a God,
a Lord, a Chriſt, and ſuch an head as neuer
ſheweth him ſelfe, nor was ſeene of men.
Wherefore to auoyde this ſlander and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche
of the blaſphemous mouthes which
ſay, Where is now your God? let him ſhew
him ſelfe: we (I ſay) doe beleeue, that one
daye hee ſhall come to iudge the whole
earth. For this is that, that <hi>Saint Iohn</hi>
ſayeth in his <hi>Reuelation, 1. 7. Beholde,
he commeth with cloudes, and euery eye
ſhal ſee him, euen they which pearced him
<pb facs="tcp:10917:82"/>
through, and all kinreds of the earth ſhall
wayle before him, euen ſo, Amen.</hi> Let the
wicked men therefore, and the mockers of
this iudgement, triumphe neuer ſo much,
yet ſhall they not be able to hinder or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null
the deuice and purpoſe of the Lorde.
They doe in deede bende their tongues
like bowes, to ſhoote out blaſphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Where is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of his comming?</hi> But let thoſe men
vnderſtande, that as the Lorde Ieſus was
ſeene to goe vp into heauen, ſo ſhall hee
come downe agayne from heauen, as the
Angels of God reported, <hi>Actes</hi> 1. 11. And
albeit they will not beleeue it, but make a
ieſt of it, yet they ſhall feele it one daye to
their great payne and ſorowe. It is meete
then, and requiſite, that he that was (for our
ſaluation before the iudgement ſeat of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)
vniuſtly condemned, ſhoulde ſhewe in the
ende howe great his iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
ouer al fleſh is, and what his iuſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.
Seeing then we muſt all appeare
before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
euery man according to his woorkes
which he hath done here in his body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be good or bad: for the more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
proceeding in this matter, let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb facs="tcp:10917:82"/>
howe many things are neceſſarily to
be marked in this iudgement. There are
ſeuen points to be obſerued in this matter:
firſt, the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it ſelf, ſecondly, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudge,
thirdly, the perſons that ſhall bee iudged,
fourthly, the maner of this iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, after
what ſort it ſhall be, fiftly, the time, ſixtly, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
place, and laſt of all, the finall cauſe or ende
of this iudgement, wherefore it is ordeined
and reſerued. But before we ſpeak of theſe
things in order, we muſt anſwere to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,
which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly made of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilfull
and vnlearned againſt this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
for when they hear of this iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
they aſke to what ende it ſhall be, ſeeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man that dieth, is iudged already, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to heauen, or els to hel, as ſoone as the
breath is out of his body: therefore it may
ſeeme that this day is ſuperfluous &amp; neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.
To this we make anſwere, that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is of two ſortes, for there is a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
iudgement, and a <hi>generall.</hi> In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
iudgement of God, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in ſoule incontinently, as he departeth
this life, but this is for the ſoule only. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
generall iudgement, both the body &amp; ſoule
ſhalbe ioyned together, and ſo enter either
into ioye, if they beleeue in Chriſt, or into
<pb facs="tcp:10917:83"/>
payne, if they beleeue not. For vntill this
day the man is but vnperfit, as hauing the
ſoule onely in bliſſe, and not his bodye,
which ſhall in this iudgement bee rayſed
vp, and put vnto the ſoule. To this ende is
the generall iudgement: and this article
doeth proue vnto vs the reſurrection of
our bodies: for if all muſt bee iudged, euen
in the bodyes alſo, then the bodyes of
the dead muſt riſe agayne, and come to
iudgement, to receiue in their bodies, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
euerlaſting life to immortalitie, if
they haue done well here: or els euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
death, to their endles payne and
griefe. Agayne, this daye is to make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
vnto all men in the worlde, euery
mans eſtate, eyther to ſaluation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:
for all ſhall appeare toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before their iudge viſibly. The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doeth make mention of three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings
of Chriſt. The one was in the fleſh
among the Iewes in very poore eſtate,
baſe and ſimple, when hee did redeeme vs:
this we doe beleeue to bee paſt and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
already according to the Prophets, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that wicked opinion of the Iewes,
which deny he is come in the fleſh. Another
comming of Chriſt is by his holy ſpirite,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:83"/>
grace, power, and worde into our heartes:
and when his miniſters doe come vnto
vs in his name to preache his worde and
Goſpell vnto vs, then is he ſayde to come
vnto vs. Of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vnto euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
mans conſcience, our ſauiour ſpeaketh
of in the 14. of <hi>Saint Iohns</hi> Goſpel on this
wyſe, <hi>If any man loue me, hee will keepe
my worde, and my father will loue him,
and we will come vnto him, and dwell
with him.</hi> And againe, a litle before, <hi>He
that loueth me, ſhalbe loued of my father,
and I will loue him, and will ſhewe mine
owne ſelfe vnto him.</hi> So we doe pray that
<hi>his kingdome</hi> of grace may <hi>come vnto
vs,</hi> and wholy poſſeſſe our heartes and
myndes. But neither of theſe commings
doe wee ſpeake of in this place. The thirde
comming of Chriſt is to iudgement moſt
royally in his glorious kingdome, with all
his mighty and holy Angels, and whole
number of his Saintes, at the laſt daye,
when all ſhall appeare before him. The
laſt iudgement of Chriſt (which was the
firſt part of our diuiſion) is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
and ſure to come: if any doubt of it,
let him reade theſe places for his confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for to recken the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all vp, were too long
<pb facs="tcp:10917:84"/>
and tedious a matter: <hi>Matth. 24. 25. Mark.
13. Luke 21. Iohn 5. Act. 1. 17. &amp; 10. chap.
Rom. 14. 1. Cor. 15. 2. Cor. 5. Phil. 3. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo.
3. 1. Theſ. 4. 2. Theſ. 1. 1. Tim. 6. 2. Tim. 4
Titus 2. Heb. 9. Iam. 5. 8. 1. Pet. 1. &amp; 5. cha.
2. Pet. 3. 1. Ioh. 3. 2. Iude 14. Reuel. 1. &amp; 20.
chap.</hi> This iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt ſhalbe moſt
iuſt and vpright: &amp; although hee were moſt
falſly iudged and condemned, yet ſhall he
iudge his enemies moſt truely, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
whoſe iudgement it ſhall not be lawful for
any man to appeale. Wee knowe, ſaieth
Paul, that <hi>the iudgement of God is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to righteouſnes, Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 2. And <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
affirmed the like, and ſo did <hi>Dauid,
The Lord ſhal iudge his people with equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
Although iudges here be corrupt and
faulty, as bribed with giftes, affectioned
with friendes, lead with feare, moued with
fauour, or by any other meanes induced to
peruert iuſtice, yet Chriſtes iudgement
ſhall haue none of all thoſe corruptions
and infirmities. He ſhall haue moſt diuine,
yea, infinite wiſdome, that hee be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
not onely to ſee thinges open and
manifeſt, but alſo to iudge and to diſcerne
the very ſecretes and thoughtes of the
heart, as Paul ſayth, <hi>Hee will lighten the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:84"/>
things hid in darkeneſſe, and make the
counſels of the heartes manifeſt, 1. Cor.</hi> 4.
His ſentence ſhall be ſincere and ſounde,
not partial, inclining more to one part, then
to another, in whome neither the loue of
friendes, nor feare of foes, nor bribery by
giftes and rewardes, ſhal haue any part
or place. <hi>For there is no reſpect of perſons
with Chriſt, Roman.</hi> 2. Seeing then (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)
that this iudgement is ſo ſeuere and
ſtraight, let vs be diligent, that we may be
founde of him in peace without ſpot, and
blameleſſe, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> doeth counſell vs.
Thus much for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgement it ſelfe, which
was the firſt thing propoſed. Now let vs
come to the ſecond part, to conſider who is
our iudge. It is ſayde, that he ſhall come to
iudge, that is, Chriſt: for to him is al iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
committted, &amp; the father doth iudge
in the perſon of his ſonne, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. becauſe
all men ſhoulde honour the ſonne, as they
honour y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father. I neede not to bring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places for the proofe of this, the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are full of it, that Chriſt is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſupreme
iudge, and I hope I neede not to perſwade
men in the doctrine. Let vs rather ſee what
we may gather out of this doctrine, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it to our conſciences, for our conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:10917:85"/>
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort. The vſe of this doctrine, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Chriſt
is our iudge, is two fold: either in reſpect of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked, or els as concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good. As
concerning the good, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Chriſt ſhall be their
only iudge, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not but greatly reioyce
&amp; conceiue a wonderful comfort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
&amp; brother ſhal be their iudge, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he wil not iudge partially, yet ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
being a brother &amp; ſauiour, yea y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of
his body, will iudge moſt mercifully: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our ſauiour biddeth vs, when we ſee
this iudgement drawe neere, to lift vp our
heades and to reioyce, becauſe our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
draweth on. For how ſhould we feare,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt wil make vs iudges with him?
as he ſayth, <hi>Ye that haue folowed me in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhal ſit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> twelue thrones, &amp;
iudge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> twelue tribes of Iſrael.</hi> And Paul
ſayth, <hi>Doe ye not know,</hi> that <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaintes ſhal
iudge the world?</hi> Not that we ſhale be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
with Chriſt, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhal allow &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For to ſpeak properly,
the elect ſhall not be iudged, but the wicked
ſhall be iudged to euerlaſting fire. This
certainly is no ſmal comfort for weake co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
to conſider y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prince ſhal iudge
his owne people &amp; ſubiectes, the head his
<pb facs="tcp:10917:85"/>
members, &amp; the aduocate his clients. How
then can he condemne thoſe, for whoſe ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
he doth come, &amp; will ratifye y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> promiſe
of euerlaſting bliſſe, which he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
here in this life by his Goſpel? We ſhal
not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be cited before any other tribunall
ſeate, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our louing bridegro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, who ſhal
make himſelfe ready to receiue his ſpouſe &amp;
wife, vnto himſelfe for euer. <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 21.
This day is called the mariage day of the
Lambe, and his ſupper: and his wife ſhall
then be arayed with pure and fine linen and
ſhining, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouſnes of ſayntes.
Let vs therefore be glad and reioyce, and
giue glory to him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſitteth vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> throne.
There can be no day here ſo ioyful as this,
yea al comfort is nothing to this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt
ſhalbe our iudge. He ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not caſt away the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for
whom he hath died: he cannot deny himſelf.
Paul whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he conſidered of this iudge and
iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, reioyced eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a crowne
of righteouſnes was laid vp for him, which
the righteous iudge Chriſt Ieſus would
giue vnto him in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. And here
we learne a very good leſſon by the way, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
if Chriſt be our iudge, we muſt (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
not haue redreſſe here, or iudgement equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
miniſtred vnto vs) referre our cauſes
<pb facs="tcp:10917:86"/>
and matters of iniurie to him, who is able
to reforme all things, and will at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
So that we muſt not, which are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
men, reuenge our owne quarels and
iniuries, but commit them al to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
murmuring, and hee will iudge them
iuſtly. Then this doth teache vs patience, to
wayte for this comming of Chriſt, to iudge
all thinges orderly. And this good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle
did <hi>Saint Iames</hi> giue in his time to
the poore oppreſſed labourers &amp; huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which were defrauded by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rich men,
&amp; had their hier and wages kept backe: hee
doeth comfort them in this reſpect, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt
wil come to iudge their cauſe, ſaying, <hi>Be
patient, brethren, vntill the comming of
the Lord, and ſettle your heartes: for the
comming of our Lorde draweth nere.</hi> Yea
and our ſauiour Chriſt ſayde, <hi>Luk. 18. that
God will auenge his elect, which cry day
and night vnto him, and that ſhortly.</hi>
Whereby we may gather alſo, that the day
of iudgement is not farre off as the wicked
doe ſuppoſe, but draweth on, euery day nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
then other. Let vs therefore, as our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
doth counſel vs, watch and pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
that we may be able to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him at his comming to iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. We
<pb facs="tcp:10917:86"/>
ſee then that we muſt commit our cauſes
to Chriſt, &amp; offer our complaintes againſt
the wicked to him, <hi>and then doutles with
our eyes we ſhal behold &amp; ſee the reward
of the wicked, Pſal.</hi> 91. As this is very
comfortable doctrine to the godly, to heare
that Chriſt is their iudge and auditor of
al their cauſes: ſo is it as doleful and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
a thing to the wicked and caſt awaies,
to wey with themſelues, that Chriſt their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
ſhalbe their iudge, whome they haue
alwayes in their life time hated, made a
mocke of, and had in vtter contempt, both
him, his Goſpel, and miniſters of his word
and ſacraments. This ſhall pearce them to
the very heart, to ſee him their iudge, whom
they could neuer abyde: yea his ſight, and
preſence ſhalbe ſo feareful, and terrible vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them all, that they ſhall curſe the time,
that euer they were borne: for they ſhal hide
themſelues in dennes, and rockes of the
mountaines, and ſhall ſay to the hilles, Fall
vpon vs, and hide vs from the preſence of
him that ſitteth vpon the throne, and from
the wrath of the Lambe: for the great day
of his wrath is come, and who can ſtande?
Theſe and the like wordes ſhall they vtter
for dolour and anguiſh of minde, and yet
<pb facs="tcp:10917:87"/>
finde no comfort: for they haue refuſed the
Lorde and God of all comfort here vpon
the earth, and therefore ſhall not haue him
there to be their comforter. And <hi>S. Iohn</hi>
doeth tell vs who theſe are, to whome
this iudge Ieſus ſhalbe ſo fierce and cruel:
euen the kinges of the earth, and the great
men, and the riche men, and the chiefe
captaines, and the mightie men, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
bond man, and euery free man,
<hi>Reuelation</hi> 6. not meaning all kings, and
noble men, but ſome of euery ſtate and
ſorte of men, yea, the greater part of euery
degree of men, eſpecially of great men:
for not many noble, not many wiſe, not
many mightie men are called to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel, leſt they ſhould bragge:
but rather the poore, the baſe, the vnwiſe
are choſen, becauſe they ſhould not vant
of their worthineſſe, as Paul doeth tell vs
in the 1. <hi>Corinthians. 1 Chap.</hi> moſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
To conclude this part, ſeeing the
Lord ſhal be iudge to the wicked, euen the
Lord Ieſus, to render flaming fire, and
vengeance vnto them that know not God,
and obey not his Goſpel, this may teach
them to feare and to liue ſomewhat more
orderly, if not for the loue of God, of
<pb facs="tcp:10917:87"/>
heauen, and vertue: yet for feare of hell,
death and damnation, to auoyde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that wil light vpon ſinne at that day.
Let vs come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third poynt. The perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
that ſhall come before this iudge to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
and trìed in iudgement, they are
ſayde here to be the quicke and the dead,
that is to ſay, al, both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuing and the dead.
But here ſome may aſke this queſtion,
Seeing it is appointed to al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once to die,
becauſe they are mortal, how is it ſaid here,
that ſome ſhall be quicke and aliue at
the comming of Chriſt? To this wee
make anſwere, that they that ſhalbe aliue
at the ſecond comming of Chriſt to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhall as it were dye, for they ſhall
all be changed and renewed, and that ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
as if they had bene long dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
and this is the meaning of Paul, 1
<hi>Corinth. 15. Wee ſhal not all dye,</hi> that
is, wee ſhall not all be layde in the graue
as others, <hi>but we ſhall all be in a moment
altered,</hi> which ſhalbe in ſteade of a death
vnto vs. So we ſee what we haue to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
to this queſtion. The perſons then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
are to be ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moned &amp; cited to appeare by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
voyce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Archangel &amp; tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet of God, in
<pb facs="tcp:10917:88"/>
a woord generally are all men, that euer
haue bene from the firſt man Adam, or ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
to the laſt man that ſhalbe borne here
vpon the earth. None can eſcape this iudge,
or hide himſelfe away from his ſight, which
ſeeth into the bottome of the ſea, euen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the middeſt of the earth and hell: none
ſhalbe forgotten, not the leſt childe that is,
for he hath all written in his bookes, both
good and bad, great and ſmall: for theſe are
the wordes of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>We muſt all
appeare before the iudgement ſeate of
Chriſt.</hi> And againe, <hi>As I liue, ſaith the Lord,
euery knee ſhall bowe to me, and euery
tongue confeſſe to me.</hi> None then ſhalbe
miſſing: no not the great Monarches, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
and Kings of the earth ſhall
helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues here or flee away, but they
ſhalbe brought to iudgement, and ſtand at
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barre as others do, &amp; be brought as lowe
as the loweſt. Wel, let vs apply this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
for our vſe, to profit by it. Of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
that we muſt al come to iudgement,
and none eſcape, Paul gathereth this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
and leſſon: that knowing the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of the Lorde, we ſhould doe our duety,
that both dwelling at home and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
from home, wee may be acceptable
<pb facs="tcp:10917:88"/>
vnto him. For it made Paul the more rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to doe his office and function in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
ſaying, <hi>We knowing this, perſwade
men, and are made manifeſt vnto God,
and I truſt alſo that we are made manifeſt
vnto your conſciences, 2. Corin.</hi> 5. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
let vs ſee the maner and order of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
iudgement. Our Sauiour Chriſt
doeth moſt liuely deſcribe it in the 25. of
Matthewes Goſpel, ſaying, <hi>When the
Sonne of man commeth in his glory, and
all the holy angels with him, then ſhall he
ſit vpon the throne of his glory, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him ſhall be gathered all nations, and
he ſhall ſeparate them one from another,
as a ſhephearde ſeparateth the ſheepe
from the goates, and he ſhal ſet the ſheepe
on his right hand, and the goates on his
left: then ſhall the king ſay to them on
his right hand, Come ye bleſſed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
take the inheritance of the kingdome
prepared for you, from the foundation of
the world: For I was hungry, and ye gaue
me meate, I was thirſtie, and ye gaue mee
drinke, I was a ſtranger, and ye tooke me
in vnto you, I was naked, and ye clothed
me, I was ſicke, and ye viſited me, I was in
priſon, and ye came vnto me, and ſo forth.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:89"/>
Then ſhal he ſay to them on his left hand,
Depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mee ye curſed into euerlaſting
fire, which is prepared for the deuill and
his angels: For I was an hungred, and yee
gaue mee no meate, I thirſted, and yee
gaue me no drinke, &amp;c. And theſe ſhall
goe into euerlaſting payne, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
into life eternall.</hi> Here wee ſee the
fourme and order of this iudgement, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
moſt liuely vnto vs in the perſon of
Chriſt a King, putting ſome on the ryght
hande, and ſome on the left hande. S. Paul
alſo doth ſet it out vnto vs moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly,
<hi>that the Lord Ieſus ſhall deſcend fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
with a ſhoute, and with the voyce of
the Archangel, and Trumpet of God, and
the dead in Chriſt ſhall ryſe firſt, and wee
which remayne aliue, ſhall bee caught vp
with them alſo into the cloudes, to meete
the Lorde in the ayre: and ſo ſhall we bee
euer with the Lorde.</hi> Where note, that he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>etteth it out onely for the comfort of the
godly, making no mention in this place of
the wicked. Saint Peter ſaith, <hi>It ſhall be
as a thiefe in the nyght, in the which the
heauens ſhall paſſe away with a noyſe,
and the elementes ſhall melt with heate,
and the earth with the woorkes that are
<pb facs="tcp:10917:89"/>
therein, ſhalbe burnt vp. 2. Pet.</hi> 3. S. Iohn
in the Reuelation doeth very effectually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
this thing in like maner: for he ſaieth,
<hi>that a great white throne was ſet which
he ſaw, and one that ſate vpon it, and the
dead ſtood both great &amp; ſmal before God,
the bookes were opened, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea, and death,
and hel gaue vp their dead, and euery man
was iudged according to the things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the bookes, Reuel.</hi> 20. Wee learne
this good leſſon by it, as Peter doeth teach
vs, that ſeeing the maner of this great and
laſt day of iudgement by Chriſt, ſhall be ſo
terrible in reſpect of the alteration of the
creatures, wee ought to be holy in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
and godlineſſe, looking, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
for the comming of that day of the
Lord Ieſus to iudgement. And here fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
wee gather, that heauen and earth
ſhall be diſſolued, and made newe, that this
worlde nowe ſhall haue an ende, as it had a
beginning, contrary to the falſe opinion of
the Philoſophers and wicked Atheiſtes of
our time, which thinke that all things ſhall
continue (as they doe) for euer. Thus much
for the maner of the iudgement. Nowe as
concerning the time, our Sauiour Chriſt
hath forewarned vs, <hi>that it is not for vs to
<pb facs="tcp:10917:90"/>
knowe the times and ſeaſons which the
father hath put in his owne power, Act. 1.
For of that daye and houre, knoweth no
man: no not the angels which are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
neyther the Sonne him ſelfe, but my
Father onely</hi> (ſaith Chriſt.) Which is to be
vnderſtoode, that Chriſt knoweth not the
latter day as hee is man, but as he is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
God, and one with his Father, euen
his wiſedome, he knoweth it, and al things
elſe. We ſee then, that the day and houre is
moſt vncertaine, and yet the thing it ſelfe
moſt certaine that it ſhall be. But although
this day and houre be vnknowen, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
our Sauiour Chriſt hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs ſignes and tokens of his comming,
which may ſturre vs vp the more warily to
waite for his comming. Theſe things our
Sauiour ſayd ſhoulde come to paſſe before
he came, &amp; we ſee they are fulfilled already:
many ſhall come in his name to deceiue vs,
ſaying, I am Chriſt, &amp; ſhall deceyue many:
we ſhall heare of warres: nation ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
nation, realme againſt realme, there
ſhall be famine, earthquakes, and peſtilence
in diuers places: the godly ſhalbe afflicted,
killed, and hated of al men for Chriſts ſake:
many ſhall bee offended at the Goſpel, and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:90"/>
betray one another: the father the ſonne, and
the ſonne the father: the brother againſt the
brother, ſhall riſe, and put him to death: falſe
prophets ſhall aryſe and deceiue many, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
ſhalbe increaſed, and the loue of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſhall bee colde, and the Goſpel ſhall bee
preached vnto all nations, and then ſhall the
end come. Furthermore there ſhalbe ſignes
in the ſunne, and in the moone, and in the
ſtarres: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſunne ſhalbe darkened, the moone
ſhall not giue her lyght, and the ſtarres of
heauen ſhall fall: which things haue come to
paſſe, whither you take them litterally, or
allegorically: for both the ſunne and moone
hath beene eclipſed, and ſignes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
haue appeared in the ſtarres, and if ye
take the ſonne for the worde of God and
Goſpel, we ſee it hath bene darkened, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
by the Papiſtes. The moone which
doth repreſent the Church, which taketh her
light from the ſunne Ieſus Chriſt, hath byn
perſecuted &amp; turned into blood, and not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
her light by reaſon of troubles: and the
ſtarres which are likened to the preachers,
haue fallen away, and otherwiſe ſtept aſide.
Theſe things and the lyke may put vs in
minde, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt is not far
off, euen as when we ſee the trees begin to
<pb facs="tcp:10917:91"/>
budde, we know then that the ſpring time is
neere. We know furthermore that the time
of this iudgement ſhalbe very ſudden, as the
lightnings, or as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of a thiefe, and
as the ſudden crying out of a woman with
childe. For as it was in the dayes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> floud
in Noes time, the waters came and tooke
them all away, ſo ſhall the comming of the
ſonne of man be. Likewiſe alſo, as it was in
the dayes of Lot, they ate, they dranke, they
bought, they ſolde, they planted, they buylt,
they gaue in marriage, and married wiues,
but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day that Lot went out of Sodom,
it rayned fire &amp; brimſtone from heauen, and
deſtroyed them all. After theſe enſamples
ſhall it be in the day whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sonne of man
is reuealed. And ſurely this day is hid from
our eyes, that we ſhoulde be prepared euery
day, &amp; not be ſecure or careles, to differre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and put it off from day to day, as a
great many do among vs. Seeing then the
time is at hand, and yet vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we ought
to be prepared and be in a readines, &amp; to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
our Maſters counſel: for he ſaith, <hi>Take
heed to your ſelues, leaſt at any time your
hearts be oppreſſed with ſurfeting &amp; drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes,
and cares of this life, and leaſt that
day come on you at vnwares: for as a ſnare
<pb facs="tcp:10917:91"/>
ſhall it come vpon all them that dwell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the face of the whole earth.</hi> Watch
therefore and pray continually, that ye may
be counted worthy to eſcape all theſe things
that ſhall come to paſſe, &amp; that ye may ſtande
before the Sonne of man. This daye is as
the day and time of our death, as we knowe
not when we ſhall die, and yet it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that we ſhall die: ſo it is with this day.
And whether a man ſhoulde looke for the
day of his death, or this day of iudgement
firſt, truely I can not tell: they are both
ſo vncertaine, neither haue we longer war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of time preſcribed vnto vs in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the one, then of the other. I praye
God, the Lord Ieſus may finde vs as good
ſeruants, doing his will and woorke at his
comming, that wee may haue our candles
burning in our handes, with oyle in our
lampes, and the marriage garment on our
backes, ready to open the doore, when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
and knocketh for vs. Happy ſhal we be
if the Lord find vs ſo doing: otherwiſe, if he
finde vs ſmiting our felow ſeruants, eating
and drinking, &amp; being drunken, he ſhal come
vpon vs at vnwares, and cut vs in pieces, &amp;
giue vs our portion with the vnbelieuers &amp;
hypocrites, where ſhalbe weeping and gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
<pb facs="tcp:10917:92"/>
of teeth. Let vs therefore I beſeeche
you brethren by the Lorde Ieſus, knowing
the time is ſhort and at hande, euen in the
doores, gird vp the loines of our minde, that
when our Sauiour knocketh, we may open
vnto him immediatly. Thus wee ſee what
we haue to note and learne vpon the time of
the comming of Chriſt vnto iudgement.
The place alſo is to be conſidered, the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and kinreds of the people that ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
that day, are ſo many and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the earth ſhall not bee able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
them all: therefore Saint Paul ſaith,
that <hi>we ſhall be caught vp in the cloudes,
to meete the Lord in the ayre.</hi> So that all
ſhall bee taken vp into the ayre as the place
of iudgement. But I come to the laſt poynt
which is more materiall to our purpoſe, for
what ende this great and laſt day is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and kept in ſtore. It hath two endes or
cauſes, why it is ordayned of the Lorde: the
one is, that the godly may be deliuered out
of their miſeries and troubles, which they
haue here ſtoutly endured for Chriſtes
ſake, and be receyued into euerlaſting life.
The other is, that the wicked &amp; reprobate,
and all the companie of infidels, which haue
herecontemned the Lord, &amp; liued in pleaſure
<pb facs="tcp:10917:92"/>
and delites of the fleſhe, may be iuſtly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
as they haue well deſerued, with euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
fire &amp; brimſtone, which is the ſecond
death. For it might ſeeme if there were no
iudgement or life after this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lord were
notiuſt in his doings: for neither are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly
and ryghteous rewarded many times in
this life, neyther are the vngodly puniſhed
for their offences while they liue here, for
the moſt part. Now God is moſt iuſt, which
will rewarde all godlines and vertue, and
ſeuerely puniſh vice and wickednes. Theſe
two endes, doth our Sauiour mention in
the general iudgement: the one ſort ſaith he,
<hi>ſhall goe into euerlaſting life, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſort into euerlaſting fire,</hi> Matth. 25.
Saint Paul likewiſe doth make mention of
theſe cauſes, in the ſecond epiſt. of the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,
the firſt chapter, ſhewing as well
what the good ſhall haue, as the bad, ſaying
on this wiſe, <hi>It is a righteous thing with
God, to recompenſe tribulation to them
that trouble you, and to you which are
troubled, reſt with vs, when the Lord Ieſus
ſhall ſhewe him ſelfe from heauen with
his mighty angels in flaming fire, rendring
vengeance vnto them that do not knowe
GOD, and which obey not the Goſpel of
<pb facs="tcp:10917:93"/>
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, which ſhalbe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with euerlaſting perdition from the
preſence of the Lord, and from the glorie
of his power:</hi> thus much for the wicked.
Now foloweth rewarde for the good, when
hee ſhall come the bee glorified in his ſaintes,
and to bee made marueylous in all them
that beleeue in that day. Here wee may haue
a notable diſcourſe, as is in any place of
ſcripture, why our ſauiour Chriſt ſhal come
to iudgement, both in reſpect of the good
and bad: yea, the wicked angels and ſpirites
them ſelues, as Iude ſaith, <hi>hee hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in euerlaſting chaines of darkeneſſe,
vnto the iudgement of the great day.</hi> This
day is greatly deſired and longed for of the
godly, and eſpecially of the true miniſters
of Chriſtes Goſpell, that their cauſe may
bee knowen to bee good agaynſt the
wicked, and their ſayings veryfied concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this iudgement: for ſurely there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
almoſt ſeene of God, or beleeued of
the wicked vntyll that day. Tell them of
this day, and terrifie them with it, they make
a mocke at it, they count them for fooles and
ſimple perſons, that liue a godly and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
life: but when this day commeth, (as
it will come certainly) it will make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb facs="tcp:10917:93"/>
for all, and they ſhall finde all
our ſayings &amp; threatnings to be moſt true.
Therefore the godly deſire it in reſpect of
Gods glorie chiefly, which the wicked haue
defaced. A great many of them thinke that
there is neyther hell nor heauen, God nor
Deuill, and that all are but fables that wee
ſpeake of this day, and ſo they growe to an
vtter contempt of God and all godlines.
But (as the Lord liueth) they ſhall finde
it true by experience, which they woulde
not here embrace by fayth: yea, they ſhall
confeſſe themſelues ſtarke fooles, and the
godlie men to bee wiſe in deede, Wiſedome
5. Chriſt Ieſus ſhall bee that great Lorde
and riche maſter of the houſe, which ſhall
come to take an account of his ſeruantes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes
giuen vnto them to encreaſe and vſe
to his honour and glory, and to the good
and diligent ſeruauntes ſhall hee giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
and ioy, but to the vnprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes,
ſtripes and paine eternall. This
ſhalbe the newe married bridegrome and
huſbande, which ſhall come to make a choiſe
of the wiſe and chaſte virgins, which haue
kept them ſelues pure vnto him, from the
fooliſhe and vnchaſte, which haue defyled
them ſelues with the wicked worlde.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:94"/>
In that day Chriſt ſhalbe that good and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
huſbandman, which ſhal come to gather
the wheate in the time of harueſt into his
barnes for his owne vſe, but ſhall burne
the chaffe with vnquenchable fire. And to
conclude, hee ſhall be that great ſhepheard
which ſhall diuide the lambes and ſheepe
from the goates, the one to ſitte on his right
hande in ioy, the other to ſitte on his lift
hande in ſorowe: to this ende no doubt ſhall
our ſauiour Chriſte come, and then ſhall it
be ſaide, O happie and thriſe happie was
hee that was a faithfull ſeruant, a chaſte vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to Chriſt, the good corne, the meeke
lambe of Ieſus Chriſt. But this of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ſpoken, then ſhalbe too late, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
at that time ſhalbe in vayne. I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
all men therefore that will not there
repent that euer they were borne, as the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ſhall doe, that they woulde in the name
of Ieſus Chriſte, repent here betime, and
aſke the ſpirite of the Lord to amende their
liues, that they put not off from day to day,
vntill they are olde, or haue all thinges as
they woulde. The Lorde will come ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon ſuch an one, taking him away in
his ſinne. If wee woulde lay the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
of this iudgement day often before
<pb facs="tcp:10917:94"/>
our eyes, to ſturre vp our ſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and to awaken our dull ſpirites and
ſenſes, it woulde keepe vs in great feare
and awe before our Lorde GOD,
and drawe vs from much ſinne and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which nowe for lacke of thinking
vpon this day, is committed euery where,
both at home and abroade, as well in the
countrey and baſe mens houſes, as in the
court and great mens places. Well, wee
ſhoulde doe as a godly father did in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
Church, that whether wee eate or
drynke, whether wee ſleepe or wake, or
whatſoeuer wee doe, wee ſhoulde thinke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
this day to be at hande, and the voyce
ſounding in our cares, ariſe yee dead and
come to iudgement. Notable of al others,
is that leſſon that Solomon doth giue vnto
vs in the booke of the preacher, the 11 and
laſt Chapters, concerning this matter: hee
mocketh and derideth them that delite in
ſinne, as you ſee men commonly doe, and
afterwarde threatneth and terrifieth them
with this laſt iudgement, ſaying, <hi>Reioyce
O young man in thy youth, and let thyne
heart cheare thee in the daies of thy youth,
and walke in the wayes of thy heart, and in
the ſight of thine eies:</hi> Marke now what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sowre
<pb facs="tcp:10917:95"/>
ſauce foloweth this ſweet meate: <hi>but
knowe,</hi> ſayth hee, <hi>that for all theſe thinges,
GOD will bring thee to iudgement: for
God wil bring euery work into iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
&amp; euery ſecret thing, whether it be good or
euill.</hi> A notable glaſſe for all men to looke
vpon, is this finall iudgement. Wee are
taught by theſe thinges, that our felicitie
and pleaſure conſiſteth not in this life, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can we haue it here, but it is in the lyfe
to come layde vp for vs in Chriſt. Here are
confuted all worldlings, which thinke there
is no other lyfe after this, no ioy or payne.
This day can not bee fearefull to the godly,
for it is called our bleſſed hope, Titus. 2.
and the godly doe loue it, 2. Timothie 4.
If it bee fearefull and terrible to any, as it
is, it is to thoſe that haue no hope of heauen,
and to thoſe that put their whole pleaſure
and felicitie here belowe in their money
and ill gotten ryches. To the fearefull
and vnbeleeuyng, and the abominable, and
murderers, and whoremongers, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers,
and idolaters, and lyers, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
perſons, this day ſhall bee fearefull
and terrible: yea, it ſhall make them all
to quake for feare, for they ſhall haue their
part in the lake that burneth with fyre
and brymſtone, which is the ſeconde death,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:95"/>
Reuelation 21. This day and the cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof, ſerueth moſt fitly, to put men
in mynde of their dueties and callyngs
before the Lorde, for ſo our Sauiour
Chriſte applied it in his tyme in his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
ſaying to them that were worldely
mynded, <hi>What ſhall it profite a man,
though he ſhould win the whole worlde,
if he loſe his owne ſoule, or what ſhall a
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue for recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his ſoule?</hi> marke
his reaſon, why it is dangerous, thus to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarde
and venture his ſoule: for, ſaith he, <hi>the
ſonne of man ſhal come in the glory of his
father with his angels, and then ſhall hee
giue to euery man according to his deedes,</hi>
Mat. 16. ſo doth Paul charge Timo. eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by this iudgement day, ſaying, <hi>I charge
thee before God, &amp; before the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, which ſhall iudge the quicke
and the dead at his appearing, and in his
kingdome, Preach the worde, be inſtant,
in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, improoue,
rebuke, exhort with al long ſuffering and
doctrine,</hi> 2. Timothie 4. As if hee ſhoulde
ſay in effect, There is a day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
kept in ſtore, therefore doe thy due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
diligently. This day of iudgement
ſhall make vs very carefull to ſhewe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:96"/>
foorth all good woorkes: For Chriſt ſhall
pronounce the definitiue ſentence vpon all
men according to their workes, not that the
godly haue deſerued or merited heauen by
their good workes, that is too great a thing
to bee gotten by woorkes: for Chriſt hath
already deſerued that for vs by his good
workes, if wee beleeue in him. But Chriſt
ſhall make mention of woorkes, to ſhewe
and to ſignifie to all the worlde, that the
godly haue not beene idle or vnfruitfull in
this life, as the hypocrites are, whoſe ſheepe
ſkinnes then ſhall be plucked off, and then
ſhall they appeare to bee rauening wolues:
for this cauſe ſhall the iudgement bee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to workes, to ſturre men vp here, while
they heare this, to good works, and to make
manifeſt to al men, that the godly haue wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
innocently, and that the wicked haue
followed the luſts of the fleſh. Our faith can
not be ſeene, and therfore Chriſt ſhal ſpeake
according to the effect and conſequent of it,
which is ſeene, and that is good woorkes.
Chriſt before ſheweth the cauſe of heauen
for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> elect, not their works, but becauſe they
were bleſſed of his father, and that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was prepared for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before they were
borne, or did any good workes for it, <hi>yea,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:96"/>
before the fundations of the worlde were
layde,</hi> as Paul <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1, ſheweth moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably.
Wherefore good Chriſtians, flee the
corruption which is in the worlde, and giue
great diligence to bring forth good works,
for thoſe are good and profitable vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and ſo ye ſhall be knowen to bee good and
fruitfull trees. Ioyne moreouer vertue
with your faith, &amp; with vertue, knowledge,
with knowledge, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perance, with te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
patience, with patience, godlines, with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,
brotherly kindneſſe, &amp; with brotherly
kindnes, loue. For if theſe things be amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
you, and abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, they wil make you that ye
neither ſhall be idle, nor vnfruitfull in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt:
and he that hath not theſe things, is blinde,
and can not ſee a farre off, and hath forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
that he was purged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his olde ſinnes.
Giue therefore diligence to make your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and election ſure, for if ye doe theſe
things, ye ſhal neuer fal: for by this meanes
an entring ſhall be miniſtred vnto you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
into the euerlaſting kingdome
of our Lord and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt. We
haue heard nowe the ſixe articles that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine
to the perſon of Ieſus Chriſt, and
conteine the benefites he hath wrought for
<pb facs="tcp:10917:97"/>
vs, wherein is our whole ſaluation. For if
we ſeeke ſaluation, his name Ieſus, doeth
ſhewe it is in him alone. If we deſire puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
it is in his conception. If we require a
kinde of familiaritie and gentlenes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he hath made him ſelfe like vnto vs,
we ſhall haue it in his natiuitie. Wouldeſt
thou haue redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for thy ſinnes? looke
it in his paſſion and death. If newnes of
life, thou haſt it in his reſurrection. If inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of the heauenly kingdome, it is in
his aſcenſion. If thou aſkeſt a full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of it, thou ſhalt haue it when hee
commeth to iudgement. To be briefe, If
thou deſireſt the giftes of the holy ghoſt,
abſolution, remiſſion of ſinnes, ſatiſfaction,
and purgation for thy vnclennes, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
mortification of the fleſh, and at a
worde, all treaſures of euery heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly gift,
thou haſt them all in Ieſus Chriſt, as in a
well euer ſpringing, and a fountaine that
is neuer drie. Of whoſe fulnes thou and all
men haue receiued, and he is made of God
the father vnto thee, wiſedome, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
holineſſe, and redemption, that thou
ſhouldeſt glorie in him alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Take heede
therefore, that ſeeing he is all in all to thee,
that thou goe not from him to any other,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:97"/>
or aſcribe any one part or portion, neuer ſo
litle, of thy ſaluation to any creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.
For if thou doe, thou marreſt all, &amp;
Ieſus Chriſt will haue all or neuer a whit,
as <hi>Eſaie</hi> ſayeth, <hi>I will not giue my glorie
to an other.</hi> Well, to conclude this
article, let vs giue to Ieſus Chriſt moſt
humble and heartie thanks, that he wil one
day come downe from heauen, to fetche vs
vp thither vnto him, to immortall bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
and let vs in the meane time deſire of
him the ſpirit of patience, to wayte for his
comming to iudgement, for our full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
that we may haue our oyle, our
garmentes, and our lampes ready, that we
may be waking when he ſhall knocke, and
open the doore forthwith vnto him, that in
ſo doing, we may enter in with him to the
mariage, &amp; there raigne perpetually with
him in the glorie of his father. Which he
grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto vs for his ſonnes ſake, to whom
with the holy ghoſt, three perſons, and one
immortall God in vnitie, bee rendred all
prayſe, glorie, and giuing of thankes, from
this time forth, for euer more. Come Lord
Ieſus quickly, Amen, ſo be it.</p>

foloweth in order y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third part, concerning
our faith in God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt, which is the
third perſon in trinitie. And this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eight
article of our beliefe: <hi>I beleeue in the holy
Ghoſt,</hi> that is to ſay, I that am a Chriſtian
man, do beleeue and truſt in God the holy
ghoſt, the third perſon in the bleſſed trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which proceedeth equally from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the ſonne, being the naturall &amp; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall
power of them both, &amp; of the ſame
ſubſtance. Which ſpirite ſanctifieth &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth
me in all troubles, and aſſureth me
that I am the childe of God, and ſeruant of
Ieſus Chriſt, and ſhall haue his benefites
plentifully powred vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me. Out of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
we learne two things, firſt, what is the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:98"/>
holy ghoſt, ſecondly, what are his effects &amp;
workes, as well in it ſelfe, as in man, in
whoſe heart it worketh, and moueth him
forward to that which is good, to imbrace
and followe it with all earneſtnes, but to
hate and abhorre from the heart, that which
is naught and wicked. This holy ghoſt or
ſpirit, is the euerlaſting power and infinite
might of God the father, which ſpirite is
no creature but a creator of all things, and
very God, becauſe we are here taught to
beleue in him, which ſuerly except he were
very God, were idolatrie to do: for we muſt
not beleue in any creature, or put our truſt
in any, but in God onely. And that the holy
ghoſt is God, which certaine heretikes
haue denied, it is manifeſt in the fift chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>Actes</hi> of the Apoſtles, where
ſaint Peter ſpeaking of the holy ghoſt, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
him God. For he reprehendeth <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi>
and <hi>Sapphira</hi> his wife, for their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy
and diſſimulation, and telleth them
that they <hi>lyed vnto the holy ghoſt,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
after ſayth, that <hi>they lyed not
vnto man, but vnto God.</hi> In the firſt
of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> it is ſayde, that the <hi>ſpirite of
the Lorde moued vpon the waters.</hi> This
was the third perſon in trinitie, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb facs="tcp:10917:99"/>
he had bene God, could not haue ſo
moued vpon this great depth, and ſecretly
by his power and maieſtie, preſerued and
maintained it from falling to nothing.
Dauid ſaieth, <hi>All things were made and
created by the breath of his mouth.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if he made al things, he was very God.
For this is proper to God alone, to make &amp;
to create things. That argument of Paul
in the 1. <hi>Cor. 2. chap.</hi> doth ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly proue
this matter vnto vs, where hee ſaieth, that
<hi>this ſpirit ſearcheth al things, yea y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deepe
things of God, and that no man knoweth
the things of God, but the ſpirit of God.</hi>
Now if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of God knoweth al things,
ſearcheth al things, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is he very God, for
no creature doth this. If this be ſo, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we
rightly beleeue in the holy ghoſt, &amp; here we
gather this ſingular comfort, that we may
pray to this holy ghoſt at all times for his
helpe, &amp; to impart ſome of his knowledge
vnto vs, becauſe he hath all knowledge and
vnderſtanding. This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine that we
gather generally of this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the holy ghoſt is
true &amp; very God. For verily, except he were
God, Chriſt would not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<hi>to baptiſe in the name of the holy
ghoſt,</hi> putting him in equall condition and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:99"/>
eſtate with the father, and him ſelfe: Not
that we affirme that there be three Gods,
but this we meane: In the one and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
diuine nature and eſſence of God, we
vnderſtand three perſons by them ſelues,
diſtinct one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another. But this miſtery
of the trinitie, may better be beleeued (and
ſo it is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfull) then fitly expreſſed of
any. I leaue it therefore, to ſpeake any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of it vntill in the reſurrection, we ſhall
ſee it as it is, and perceiue that by ſight, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
face to face, which nowe wee conceiue by
our fayth onely. Thus much of the holy
ghoſt, the third perſon in this trinitie. Now
let vs conſider the wonderfull effectes of
it, which is a thing more profitable for vs.
The effectes of the holy ghoſt, are of two
ſortes: eyther as they are conſidered in
him ſelfe, or as they are in the children of
God: the effects of the holy ghoſt in him
ſelfe, are the creation of the worlde, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation
of it with al things therein, from
the beginning vnto this day. Wherein we
learne to giue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes to this holy ſpirit, for
his goodnes extended vnto vs, &amp; to pray to
him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually to mainteine vs by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
&amp; vertue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we fall not away from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10917:100"/>
For if hee take away his ſtrength and
operation from vs, wee are as blynde men
groping for the waye. And this is that, that
Dauid ſpeaketh of in his <hi>Pſalme 104. If
thou hide thy face, they are troubled,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
all his creatures. Agayne, <hi>If thou
ſende foorth thy ſpirite, they are created,
and thou renueſt the face of the earth.</hi> But
our purpoſe is eſpecially to ſpeake here of
thoſe good giftes and effectes, which this
holy ſpirite doeth worke in men, chiefly in
the elect. For there is no man, but hath
had ſome good gifte at one time, or an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
either in body or in ſoule, from this
holy ſpirit. For ſtrength, beauty, learning,
eloquence, witte, knowledge, vtterance, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,
the gift of healing, of tongues, of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
and ſuch like, are from aboue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
theſe are common, as well to the
ill and reprobate, as to the good and elect
ſonnes of God, as Paul doth ſhewe, and
declare more at large in the 12. 13. <hi>&amp; 18.
chapters of the 1. Corinthians.</hi> Our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is to ſpeake chiefly of the graces of
Gods ſpirite in the hearts of his choſen,
as of fayth, hope, and loue vnfayned, of the
ſpirit of ſanctification and adoption, which
are proper only to the elect and good, &amp; are
<pb facs="tcp:10917:100"/>
neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated to the wicked. Of this
ſpirit ſpake our ſauiour Chriſt to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
that he would ſende him vpon them,
and that the world could not receyue him.
This is that ſpirit, by whome the father
doeth place, and put the elect in ful poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the goodes and inheritance of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, and doeth keepe and preſerue
vs euery houre, and doeth make vs parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of all thinges neceſſary to ſaluation,
which thing it bringeth to paſſe, when as it
doeth create in our heartes and beget y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
inſtrument of faith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefeſt worke
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit, which bringeth foorth as a moſt
fruitefull tree, all other good fruites and
workes of a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man. This faith doth
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt ingender in our heartes, when
we heare the Goſpel of Chriſt preached: &amp;
it is confirmed &amp; encreaſed in vs, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duely
and reuerent receiuing of the ſacraments
of Chriſt. By this faith (after it is wrought
in vs by the motion and operation of
the holy ſpirite, wee apprehend and take
holde of all Chriſtes benefites, merites,
works, and good deedes whatſoeuer, and
they are made &amp; accounted ours, as if wee
had done them our ſelues. O wonderfull
gift of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worketh ſo precious a
<pb facs="tcp:10917:101"/>
iewel &amp; pearle in our heartes, as farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſiteth
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> price &amp; valew of euery thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide!
This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt effect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt, &amp;
is marueilous in our eies. An other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
&amp; effect of this holy ſpirit, is ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; holines of life, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good &amp; godly only,
&amp; therfore he is called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſpirit, for this
worke of holines in vs. For as it is proper
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father to create, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne to redeeme
and ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſome: ſo in like ſort it is proper and
peculiar to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt, to ſanctifie Gods
childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; effectually to moue their mindes
to true holineſſe. And of this effect doth <hi>S.
Paul</hi> ſpeake in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. ſhewing the
Corinthians that they <hi>were wicked men,
as fornicatours, idolatours, extortioners,
couetous, theeues &amp; ſuch like, but</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>you are waſhed, but you are ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified, but
ye are iuſtified in the name of the Lorde
Ieſus, and by the ſpirite of our God.</hi> As
if we would ſay, thoſe good graces &amp; gifts
of God were wrought &amp; imprinted in their
conſciences &amp; hearts, by the perſuaſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
holy ghoſt. Neceſſarily therfore, after our
beleefe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne, followeth our
beleefe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt: For whatſoeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as all graces do, they are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
&amp; ſealed vnto vs, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy
ghoſt. Wherefore, it is fitly compared to a
<pb facs="tcp:10917:101"/>
ſeale, whereby al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſings
of God through Chriſt, are deepely ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in our hearts, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be
raſed out any more, but ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
As we ſee the writing to be to no effect,
without a mans hand &amp; ſeale, no more are
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graces of God vnto vs, to any purpoſe,
vnleſſe he ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earneſt of his ſpirit into our
hearts, which doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs, and
aſſertaine our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we are his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
&amp; he our father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. This is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
effect, &amp; is in ſuch ſort taſted of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly,
&amp; approued of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiſedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
world, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſenſe &amp; vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of man is
able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend, neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eyes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for theſe things are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
iudged &amp; diſcerned, &amp; therefore no
maruel, if godly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of God,
and ſpeaking therewith, are mocked and
derided of the carnall men in this worlde,
which haue him not, neither can iudge any
thing of him, 1. <hi>Cor. 2. This ſpirit although
it be one &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, &amp; not many, or deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
1. Cor. 12. Epheſ.</hi> 4: yet in reſpect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
diuers &amp; ſundry effects &amp; operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of him
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Chriſt, hee is called &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of <hi>ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpirits,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, of many,
for his manifold gifts. As in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Reuelat, it is ſaid, <hi>There were ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pes of
<pb facs="tcp:10917:102"/>
fire burning before the throne, which are
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeuen ſpirites of God:</hi> that is, a ſeuen fold
ſpirit of God. This ſpirit is called, <hi>A ſpirit
of wiſedome and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, a ſpirit of
ſtrength and counſell, and the ſpirit of the
feare of the Lord,</hi> becauſe it giueth al theſe
qualityes vnto men, and doeth teache vs, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
what good gift ſoeuer we haue, we haue it
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt, the giuer of al, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
we lacke, we ſhould ſeeke it likewiſe
of the ſame ſpirit, &amp; none other. The holy
Apoſtle, rekoning vp the diuerſities of the
giftes of the holy ſpirit, affirmeth alwayes,
<hi>That it is one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit, that
giueth theſe things, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gift of wiſedome,
of knowledge, of faith, of healing, of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
of prophecie, of diſcerning ſpirites,
of tongues, of interpretation of tongues: al
theſe thinges</hi> (ſayethe he) <hi>worketh one and
the ſame ſpirit, diſtributing to euery man
ſeuerally as he wil, 1. Cor.</hi> 12. This doeth
alſo teache vs, that this ſpirit hath moſt
plentifull ſtore of giftes, to enriche the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Church of Chriſt, and that there
is no want or lacke in him. A great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort
vnto vs to knowe, whither to reſort inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
for any good gifte, &amp; to haue it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
For Chriſt hath promiſed this holy
<pb facs="tcp:10917:102"/>
ſpirit to them that ſeeke, aſke and knock
for it, <hi>Luke.</hi> 11. Doeſt thou feele thy ſelfe
to lacke fayth, or hope, or loue, or ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of life, or any good and neceſſary gift
to edifte Gods Church withall? Pray to
this holy ſpirit, &amp; vſe the ordinarie meanes
he willeth thee, as hearing the word, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
labour and ſtudy, and this ſpirite ſhalbe
giuen thee. This ſpirit was ſo neceſſary, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
our ſauiour promiſed to ſend it aboue all
things to his diſciples, to comfort them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>,
when he departed from them. <hi>For he brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
vpon them, and ſaid, Receiue yee the
holy ghoſt, Ioh.</hi> 20. And afterwarde ſent it
downe more plentifully vpon them, <hi>in the
likenes of fire and clouen tongues, Act.</hi> 2.
Wher with they were not a little co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted

1. Cap.</hi> he is called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

he worketh al things, &amp; nothing is vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

our darke &amp; blind hearts, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the bright ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es

of vs, to labour by all meanes poſſible,
to haue this ſpirit dwelling, &amp; abiding with

vnderſtoode this right wel to be ſo, for hee
prayeth that <hi>God woulde not take away
his ſpirite from him, but ſtabliſh him with

from the ſeruice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuill, &amp; from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſlaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of ſin. We are by nature, al of vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

<pb facs="tcp:10917:104"/>
this ſpirit, as a ſhip in the ſea without a
gouernour, or as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without his eyes, in
moſt dangerous caſe: for tell me, I pray
you, what is the cauſe why ſo many now a
dayes run headlong to all wickedneſſe &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s?
ſome to whoredo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, ſome to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes,
ſome to dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, ſome to pride,
ſome to theft &amp; robberies, ſome to one ſin,
&amp; ſome to another? what is the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I ſay,
but only this, becauſe God hath not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his
holy ſpirit vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
&amp; miſchiefs? And this cauſe doth <hi>S. Iude
render in his</hi> Epiſtle, for hauing rekoned vp
the natural properties &amp; conditions of the
wicked &amp; reprobate, namely, <hi>that they were
deſpiſers of gouernment &amp; autoryty,</hi> (as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Anabaptiſtes are) <hi>defilers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſhe, liuing
in pleaſure, murmurers, complayners, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
after their owne luſts, ſpeaking proud
things, flatterers &amp; ſuch like.</hi> In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end hee
addeth this, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe &amp; mother of al theſe
ſinnes, the not hauing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit, meaning
in deede, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> becauſe God hath not giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his holy ſpirit, therfore they were ſuch kind
of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he there painteth forth in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
&amp; ſuch as we dayly ſe here w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs. And
yet for al this, God is not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to any man
to giue him his ſpirit, as Paul proueth
<pb facs="tcp:10917:104"/>
                     <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 11. neither do they humble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to
aſke his grace by earneſt &amp; hearty praier, for
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould they haue it, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. By the lacke
and want of this ſpirite in other men, wee
may eaſily ſee what a benefite we haue by
him, to keepe and defende vs ſo mercifully
euery houre, in all our waies and actions of
our life. If this ſpirit leaue vs neuer ſo litle
while to our ſelues, then we fal into an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
miſcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces and euils, as we ſee in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
a ſingular man, being left to his owne
will and choyſe but a litle, he fell twiſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to doubt and diſtruſt of the power of
the Lorde, whether he were able to doe all
thinges or no, as to bring water out of the
rocke, and to feede the Iſraelites with fleſh,
being ſixe hundred thouſand men, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
ſpace, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. &amp; 20. So Dauid,
being not vpholden with this ſpirit, and left
to his owne will, fell by and by to adulterie
and murther. We had neede therefore to
pray continually to Ieſus Chriſt, the giuer
of this ſpirite, that we may haue him with
vs to direct our liues, &amp; make them accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
before the Lord. This ſpirit for diuers
other effects that it hath, is compared in the
Scriptures to water, to oyle, to fire, to
winde, to a doue. To water it is likened
<pb facs="tcp:10917:105"/>
both in the newe and olde Teſtament, as in
Eſa. 44. where the Lord ſayth, <hi>I wil powre
water vpon the thirſtie, and floods vpon
the dry grounde.</hi> And what he meaneth by
this water and dry grounde, he afterwarde
expoundeth in the ende of the verſe, ſaying,
<hi>I will powre my ſpirit vpon thy ſeede, and
my bleſſing vpon thy buddes.</hi> In the newe
Teſtament our Sauiour ſayth, <hi>If any man
thirſt, let him come vnto me and drinke:
he that beleeueth in me, as ſayth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
out of his belly ſhall flowe riuers of
waters of life.</hi> And that he meant this of the
ſpirit, Iohn immediately declareth, ſaying,
<hi>This ſpake he of the ſpirit, which they that
beleeued in him, ſhould receiue, Iohn</hi> 7. As
water therfore doeth cleanſe and purifie the
filthie and vncleane in bodie being waſhed
with it, &amp; is very neceſſary for our life here:
ſo doeth this holy ſpirit of God much more
cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe &amp; purifie our ſoules fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the infection &amp;
filthines of ſinne, as Ezechiel fitly applieth
it: <hi>I will powre cleane water vpon you, &amp;
ye ſhall be cleane, yea from all your filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
&amp; from al your idoles wil I clenſe you.</hi>
And ſo by and by ſayth, <hi>I will put my ſpirit
within you, Ezech.</hi> 36. Of this pure water
ſpeaketh the Apoſtle to the Hebr. 10. chap.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:105"/>
This ſpirit is moreouer likened to oyle, for
the ſupplenes &amp; gentlenes that is in it, &amp; in
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. To fire alſo is this
ſpirit compared, as we reade in <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. &amp;
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. For Chriſt <hi>ſhal baptize with fire,</hi> as
Iohn ſaith: which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt. For euen
as fire doeth conſume, ſcoure, purge &amp; giue
light: ſo no doubt doeth the holy ſpirite of
God conſume the wicked, ſcoure our filth,
purge our ſinnes, &amp; inlighten our ignorant
hearts, as Paul ſaith, <hi>Ariſe thou that ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt,
&amp; Chriſt ſhal giue thee light, Ephe. 5.
Lift thou vp the light of thy cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vs, Pſal.</hi> 4. Thirdly it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to a great &amp;
mighty winde, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. For as windes doe
purge &amp; make wholſome y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aire from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tagiouſnes: ſo doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit work
in the hearts of his, this purging from their
old corruption &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tagion of ſinne by Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and regenerateth and renueth vs againe by
the <hi>immortall ſeede of the worde, 1. Pet.</hi> 2.
whereby we are <hi>borne anewe, that we may
enter into the kingdome of heauen, Ioh.</hi> 3.
The ſpirite of God is alſo likened vnto a
winde in this reſpect: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as nothing is able
to reſiſt or withſtand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force of great whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>windes,
but they beare down before them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
thing that ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether
<pb facs="tcp:10917:106"/>
it be trees, houſes, caſtels or towres: ſo it is
with the ſpirit of God, whom no creature is
able to withſtande or reſiſt, but muſt needes
fall vnder it, and which deſtroyeth euery hie
thing, which is exalted againſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, caſting downe ſtrong holdes,
and the imaginations of mighty Princes, &amp;
bringeth into captiuitie euery thought to
the obedience of Chriſt, and hath ready ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
againſt all diſobedience. This thing
may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by diuers examples, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by that of the enchaunters and ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of Egypt, when they were compelled
to ſaye, that this was the finger of God, to
bring lyce out of the duſt, &amp; that they coulde
not doe the like: the ſpirite of God ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
their wiſdome and ſorcerie, <hi>Exo.</hi> 8.
Other mo examples might be brought, but
I paſſe them ouer, and leaue them to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
readers of the ſcriptures, where they
ſhall finde ſtore of them. Fourthly this holy
ſpirite is likened <hi>to a doue,</hi> as we reade of
in the 3. of <hi>Matthewe,</hi> deſcending downe
from heauen, &amp; lighting vpon our ſauiour.
He is compared to a doue, for theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and properties, which are meekeneſſe
and gentleneſſe: for this ſpirite doeth cauſe
them to put off anger and wrath, in whome
<pb facs="tcp:10917:106"/>
it abideth, and to vſe brotherly kindenes one
to another. And the doue is ſayd to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
gall, and very chaſte: ſo is this ſpirite
without all bitternes in the heartes of them
whome it doeth poſſeſſe, and teacheth them
to kéepe their veſſels in all puritie and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of life, and not in luſt of concupiſcence
as the wicked doe, which knowe not God.
For this ſpirit is called the ſpirite of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
of cleanneſſe, of innocencie. If this
be ſo, that this holy ſpirite is cleane &amp; pure,
and likened to a doue: and furthermore our
bodies are ſaid to be the Temples and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the holy Ghoſt, which dwelleth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
vs, as Paul ſayeth, <hi>Knowe ye not, that
your body is the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the holy Ghoſt?</hi>
1. <hi>Corinth. 3. &amp; 6. 2. Cor.</hi> 6. Seeing this is
ſo, we muſt prepare our houſes, and ſweepe
them cleane, to entertaine ſo honourable a
gheſt. If this houſe which is our body, be
vncleane, &amp; giuen to any vice, then ſurely,
as doues depart from filthy houſes: ſo this
moſt louing and moſt gentle doue, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of God departeth foorthwith from vs,
and then we are in a moſt miſerable caſe,
yea God will deſtroye him, that deſtroyeth
this his holy temple. Seeing then (dearely
beloued) our bodies are the temples of the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:107"/>
holy Ghoſt, and we haue ſuch promiſes that
he will dwell in them, if they be holy, and
threates that they ſhalbe deſtroyed, if they
be giuen ouer to ſinne and wantonneſſe: let
vs, I praye you, cleanſe our ſelues from all
filthines of the fleſh and ſpirit, and finiſh our
ſanctification in the feare of God, putting
off the workes of darkenes, and putting on
the armour of light, and let vs walke ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,
as in the daye time, and make proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to receyue this holy ſpirite into our
hearts. You knowe what great preparation
you make both in your houſes, and in your
bodies, to haue your apparel neate &amp; cleane,
if you be to entertayne a Prince, a noble
man, or any worſhipfull friende of yours:
then conſider with your ſelues, that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
care and diligence is to be had by tenne
thouſand partes, to lodge and receyue into
your houſes the Prince of princes, euen the
holy Ghoſt, the power of God. And ſeeing
he will vouchſafe to abide with you, &amp; take
your preparation in good woorth, firſt giue
him thankes for this his ſo vnſpeakeable
courteſie and kindeneſſe, and ſo vſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
your ſelues, as he may long continue
with you, to your great good and comfort,
&amp; grieue not this holy ſpirite of God, (by
<pb facs="tcp:10917:107"/>
whome ye are ſealed vnto the day of rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,)
by your corrupt communication pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
out of your mouthes: and ſeeing he
will be content to tarry with you, and make
his abode in your houſes, let all bitternes,
and anger, and wrath, and euill ſpeaking be
put farre away from you, with all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
For ſurely if theſe thinges be among
vs, he will depart from vs, and then he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs to our owne willes. This can not
bee but a great griefe of minde, for if our
friende ſhoulde goe away from vs, by our
vncourteous dealing and vſing of him, we
woulde be ſory: much more ſhoulde we be
ſorie, when ſuch a friende departeth and
leaueth our companie, becauſe we are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to vice and naughtineſſe, whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
was all ioye, and whoſe abſence from
vs, is extreme miſerie and curſedneſſe.
Wherefore as this ſpirite was obtayned by
the meanes of prayer, ſo is he kept and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
with vs by earneſt prayer, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the worde, and other ſuch godly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
of the Chriſtians, in which they are
commanded to walke in. For the fruite of
the ſpirite is in all goodneſſe, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and trueth, approouing that which is
<pb facs="tcp:10917:108"/>
acceptable and pleaſing the Lord. And here
is another effect woorthie the nothing, that
this holy Ghoſt inhabiting within the elect
and children of God, doeth make now their
workes and labours to be acceptable vnto
him, which before his comming vnto vs,
were abominable &amp; vnpleaſant vnto God:
not that our good works deſerue any thing
at his handes, but becauſe we are ingraffed
vnto Chriſt by the ſeale of his ſpirit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that which was ill in vs before, is nowe
made good and accepted, as if it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
yea through this ſpirite, which doeth ſo
ſeaſon inwardly our actions, that they are
liked of God, we become thereby not onely
his faithfull ſeruants, &amp; deare friends, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
which is much more, his welbeloued ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes,
as Paul ſheweth vnto vs, <hi>Becauſe ye are
ſonnes, God hath ſent foorth the ſpirite of
his Sonne into your hearts, which cryeth,
Father, father. Wherfore thou art no more
a ſeruant, but a ſonne. Nowe if thou bee a
ſonne, thou art alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heire of god through
Chriſt.</hi> If this be ſo, that we be made the
ſonnes of God, and haue receiued the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of children by this holy ſpirite: then we
may aſſure our ſelues of ſaluation, vnleſſe
the obedient childe may doubt of the good
<pb facs="tcp:10917:108"/>
will of his louing father. Here then falleth
to the ground the doctrine of the Papiſtes,
that teach men to doubt and ſtande in feare
of their ſaluation. For is not this a very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
and a fooliſh Poſition, that they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne,
that we may call God Father, and
yet doubt, whether he will beſtowe the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of children vpon vs? Shall I call
him father, and doubt of this? For theſe are
the wordes of the holy Ghoſt, vttered by S.
Paul, <hi>That the ſpirite of God witneſſeth
with our ſpirite, that we are the ſonnes of
God.</hi> This being ſo, marke what Paul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
&amp; bringeth in vpon this poynt, <hi>If we
be childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we are alſo heires, euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heires
of God, and heires annexed with Ieſus
Chriſt.</hi> Shall I now be made &amp; appoynted
an heire by good &amp; ſufficient warrant of the
holy Ghoſt, which lyeth not, nor deceyueth,
and yet doubt of my inheritance? that were
a mad thing. Can the ſeruant doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be his maſters man, or ſhall receyue
his wages, when he weareth his maſters
coate and cogniſance? or can one doubt of
the writing to be authentical and good, that
hath the parties hande and ſeale vnto it? Or
may a man doubt, hauing receiued earneſt
in part of payment, but that he ſhall in tyme
<pb facs="tcp:10917:109"/>
conuenient haue the whole, hauing bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with an houeſt man? Or doe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
the witneſſe of honeſt men of credite
nere in matters politicall, and ſhall not we
receyue the witneſſe of God the Father, the
Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, which is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and more to bee beleeued of vs, when
hee promiſeth ſaluation to the beleeuers?
Surely if we doubt, then we haue not faith:
for <hi>he that doubteth, is not grounded in
the faith, but is like a waue of the ſea, toſt
of the winde, and caryed away, Iames</hi> 1.
How can I haue hope of ſaluation, as I am
commaunded, and yet be in deſpaire of it,
and doubt with my ſelfe? A man can not
hope for that, whereof he doubteth. Doeth
not Saint Iohn ſay playnely, <hi>We knowe
that we are tranſlated from death to life,
becauſe we loue the brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</hi> He ſaith not,
We doubt of it. And againe, <hi>Hereby we
knowe that he abideth in vs, euen by his
ſpirit which he hath giuen vs.</hi> And all this
aſſurance commeth to paſſe by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
and witneſſe of this holie ſpirite, which
therefore is called the ſeale of God, the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
penie, the ſpirite of trueth, which can
not deceyue, or be deceyued. And here I
can not but maruayle at the ignorance and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:109"/>
blindeneſſe of the Papiſts, which while they
go about to eſtabliſh this doctrine of error,
they impugne and ouerthrowe another of
their owne. For they ſaye, that a man may
fulfill the Lawe of God perfitly: nay they
go further, and ſay, he may fulfil the Lawe,
and doe all that God hath commaunded in
his worde written, and more to, which are
workes of ſupererogation beſides, which he
hath not commaunded, (and ſo in deede he
hath not,) and theſe workes the Monkes
and Friers doe beſtowe vpon their friendes
which lacke them, for they haue ynough for
themſelues, and theſe they ſell to others,
which are the ouerplus, and they call them
the ſtore of the Church. Nowe thus ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the caſe. If they keepe the Lawe, then
they neede not doubt, but that God wil giue
them the rewarde of it, which is life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation:
and why then doe they doubt, if it
be true? they fulfill the commandementes:
then let them not diſtruſt of their wages
and hire. Wherefore one of theſe two muſt
needes follow: If they keepe the Lawe,
then they neede not doubt of life. If they
doubt of ſaluation, then it is certaine they
keepe not the Lawe. In one of theſe two
they muſt needes bee founde lyers by their
<pb facs="tcp:10917:110"/>
owne confeſſion. But in deede they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
in both of them: for it is falſe, that they
keepe the Lawe, which is a yoke that can
not be borne of any man, except Chriſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is ſpiritual, &amp; biddeth vs not to ſinne,
neyther in deede, neither in worde, no not ſo
much as once in thought, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. And the
other is as falſe, that we ſhould doubt of our
ſaluation. But in deede the firſt author of
this doctrine, the Pope himſelfe, out of
whoſe ſhop it came, that great Antichriſt,
and a man of all abominations that euer
were, might well teache this doctrine, and
doubt of his ſaluation, liuing (as he doth) in
filthy fornication with his Curtiſanes and
harlots at Rome, ſturring vp Chriſtian
Princes to warre one with another, to
mainteyne his vnſatiable ambition, pride, &amp;
couetouſnes, with all maner of wickednes:
Mouing likewiſe the ſubiectes to rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their lawful and natural princes and
magiſtrates, diſcharging the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their othes
and obedience vnto their rulers. I ſaye, he
that doeth theſe things, and worſe, may wel
doubt of his ſaluation: for he hath nothing
to do in the kingdom of God. And ſo all his
adherents, folowing his ſteppes &amp; religion,
whoſe liues are altogether moſt filthie and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:110"/>
wicked, may be in the ſame caſe and ſtate
with their holy father the Pope. But they
ſay, We can by no meanes be ſure of our
ſaluation, becauſe we can not be ſure of our
perſeuerance in the faith of Chriſt vnto the
ende. But this is vtterly falſe: for the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſayth, that the godly ſhall continue and
perſeuere vnto the ende. Paul was ſure
that he had the ſpirit of God, and that cauſed
him to be perſwaded, that neyther thinges
preſent, neither things to come ſhoulde be
able to ſeparate him from the loue of God,
which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lorde. Then
we may be ſure, that thinges to come ſhall
not remoue vs from God. Againe, the loue
of God is conſtant and perfite, <hi>and whom
he once loueth, he loueth with an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
loue, euen vnto the ende,</hi> as Chriſt is
ſayde to loue his, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. And to whome
God hath giuen this ſpirite of adoption, as
he doeth to the Elect, he neuer taketh it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
but is ſtil a teſtimonie vnto their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
that they ſhalbe ſaued in the ende,
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in the meane ſeaſon in the faith
and obedience of Chriſt Ieſus their Lorde.
Yea Paul is perſuaded of the Philippians,
(and ſo muſt we be of our ſelues) <hi>that he
that hath begunne a good worke in vs, wil
<pb facs="tcp:10917:111"/>
performe it vntill the day of the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, Philip.</hi> 1. And he hath the like to the
Corinthians, that <hi>God wil confirme them
vnto the ende, 1. Cor.</hi> 1. And they that are
elected, ſhal continue: <hi>For the giftes and
calling of God are without repentance,
Rom.</hi> 11. S. Iohn a man beloued of Ieſus
Chriſt, and to be beleeued before our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
doubted not to ſay and affirme for a
trueth, in his ſeconde Epiſtle to a vertuous
Lady, that <hi>the trueth which dwelleth in
vs, ſhalbe with vs for euer.</hi> If it ſhal remaine
with vs for euer, how ſhould we doubt, that
it can forſake vs at any time, either preſent
or to come? <hi>Proue your ſelues,</hi> ſayth Paul,
<hi>whether ye are in the faith: examine your
ſelues: knowe ye not your owne ſelues,
that Ieſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probats?</hi>
Here he wil haue vs to be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſwaded, that Chriſt dwelleth in vs, &amp;
ſo to be ſure of ſaluation, vnleſſe we will be
counted reprobates, which God forbid. If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Papiſts wil be counted reprobates, let them
then doubt of their ſaluation: if not, then let
them recant, &amp; be aſſured of it with vs, and
amend their religion and maners ſpeedily.
Neyther is this doctrine, as ſome ignorant
perſons terme it, a doctrine of raſhneſſe and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:111"/>
preſumptuouſnes, vnles Gods worde teach
vs preſumption. But this is a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
doctrine, as at all times, ſo eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
at the houre of death, when our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
doe accuſe vs, and Satan aſſault vs,
and the paynes of death come vpon vs: (I
ſaye) this doeth comfort weake and feeble
conſciences not to deſpaire, and the other
doctrine of theirs doeth leade men the hye
way to deſperation, to doubt whether they
ſhall be ſaued or no. They ſaye, we muſt
feare. It is true: but not feare to bee dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
For <hi>there is no damnation to them
that are in Chriſt, which walke not after
the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, Rom.</hi> 8. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
muſt this feare bee without faith and
hope: for then it is a ſlauiſh feare of the
whippe and ſcourge, and not a childes
feare, to feare to diſpleaſe his louing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Wee muſt then haue the feare of
ſonnes, not of hired ſeruantes, to feare to
offende and diſpleaſe ſo mercifull and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a Father, and not to feare and doubt
of our ſaluation: for it ſtandeth not in vs,
but in a ſurer rocke and grounde, which is
Ieſus Chriſt: and if we beleeue in him, we
ſhall haue euerlaſting life, <hi>Iohn 3. Act.</hi> 17.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:112"/>
And yet here we muſt take heede of another
extremitie, which the <hi>Meſſalians</hi> certaine
heretikes, with the <hi>Libertines, Anabaptiſts,</hi>
&amp; that wicked ſect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>familie of loue,</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
into: for all theſe preſume too much of
this ſpirit of God, and of their reuelations,
becauſe they ioyne not the ſpirite of God
with his word, but ſeparate it from the word
of Chriſt, and ſo it is but a fayned ſpirite of
their own fantaſtical braynes, and not from
God. Nowe as the Papiſtes take too litle,
ſo theſe men take too much, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
commeth firſt into their idle heades, by
and by they attribute it to the ſpirit of God,
be it neuer ſo wicked: and ſo theſe commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contemne the outwarde worde and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Goſpel, with the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Sacraments, whereas we knowe
that the ſpirite goeth, and is giuen by the
miniſterie of the worde, and is ioyned with
it, as <hi>Acts.</hi> 10. we reade, that <hi>while Peter
ſpake the worde, the holy ghoſt fell on all
them that heard the preaching,</hi> not before
the worde came: for Chriſt giueth not
his ſpirit, but by the hearing of his Goſpell
firſt preached, as Paul ſayde to the Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<hi>After ye heard the worde of trueth,
the Goſpel of your ſaluation, wherein alſo
<pb facs="tcp:10917:112"/>
after that ye beleeued, ye were ſealed with
the holy Spirite of promiſe, Epheſ.</hi> 1. Here
we ſee, if any would pretend the ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the worde, he may bee refuted: for they
goe both together, the worde of trueth with
the ſpirite of promiſe. For it is not our part
to diſſeuer, or diſioyne thoſe two things,
which God will haue coupled together in
one. And therefore the Prophetes, which
myght better haue vſed this prerogatiue of
the ſpirit then they, called alwayes the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to the worde of the Lorde God, ſaying,
<hi>Heare the word of the Lord, Thus ſayeth
the Lord:</hi> and ſtill, <hi>The mouth of the Lord
hath ſpoken it, Eſay</hi> 1. They pretende not
the ſpirit without the worde, although they
ſpeake moſt plentifully by him, 2. Epiſt. of
Peter 1. Chapter. <hi>For the prophecie came
not in olde time by the will of man: but
holy men of God ſpake as they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Furthermore ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
effecte of this Spirite is to moue
the heart of man, when the worde is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
vnto him: for vnleſſe Gods Spirite
perſwade and worke in our heartes within,
when the preacher ſoundeth in our eares the
outward word, he ſhal but ſpeake as it were
in the ayre, &amp; beate the eare of man in vaine.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:113"/>
Paul well conſidering this, ſayde, <hi>that he
in deed had planted, and Apollos</hi> another
preacher <hi>had watered the worde, but it is
God</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>that giueth the increaſe.
And wee knowe that God woorketh all
things in the heartes of his children by this
ſpirite, wherewith hee ſealeth them after
they haue heard and beleeued the worde
preached, Ephe.</hi> 1. and therfore in the place
aboue recited, this ſpirit is called the <hi>ſpirit
of promiſe,</hi> becauſe it doeth aſſertaine and
aſſure vs of all the bleſſinges and promiſes
of God that are made vnto vs. In the
Actes it is ſayde, that <hi>Lydia a woman
being a ſeller of purple, came to heare
Paul preach the Goſpel:</hi> but marke what
Saint Luke ſaieth, <hi>whoſe heart</hi> (ſayeth
he) <hi>the Lord opened, that ſhee attended
to the things which Paul ſpake:</hi> So that
except God open our cloſed and hard ſhutte
hearts, by the ſecret inſpiration of this holy
ſpirite, in vayne ſhall we eyther preach, or
the people heare. We haue neede then all of
vs (before we come to heare his word) pray
to God to giue vs grace to perceyue &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
his will and myſteries, &amp; to ſoften
our ſtony hearts, that they may receiue the
worde, and to circumciſe our eares to heare
<pb facs="tcp:10917:113"/>
it. This it that Dauid ſayde, <hi>O Lord open
thou mine eyes, that I may ſee the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
things of thy Lawe:</hi> and againe, <hi>O
giue me vnderſtanding, &amp; I wil keepe thy
Lawe.</hi> Now Dauid knewe very well that
all theſe things were done by the operation
of Gods ſpirite, as Paul ſayeth, <hi>The ſpirit
hath reuealed theſe things vnto vs, 1. Cor.
2. for it is hee that helpeth all our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Rom.</hi> 8. This is the marke whereby
God doeth ſeale and print in the forehead, to
be ſeene of all men, thoſe that are his, and
without the which no man can truely aſſure
him ſelfe that he belongeth vnto Chriſt: for
as the ſame Apoſtle witneſſeth, <hi>If any man
haue not the Spirite of Chriſt, the ſame
is none of his.</hi> Nowe how greatly this holy
ſpirit is to be deſired of all of vs, there is no
man that hath read the Scriptures, but well
vnderſtandeth. This made Eliſeus, a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
man, the ſcholer of Elias, when his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
bad him to aſke of him what he would,
that he might do it for him before he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away from him into heauen, that he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<hi>his ſpirite to bee doubled vpon him,</hi>
whereby he might the better ſerue the Lord
and his Church in his vocation and calling,
2. King. 2. and ſo by this ſpirit he wrought
<pb facs="tcp:10917:114"/>
wonderful miracles, and did much good by
it to the whole kingdome of Iſrael. Wee
ſee by this petition of this notable father &amp;
godly man, what we alſo ſhoulde eſpecially
deſire of God in our prayers: not riches or
wealth ſo much, which al do periſh, but this
holy ſpirite which liueth &amp; remaineth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
in them that haue him, and can neuer be
loſt or taken away. And this is the ſelf ſame
thing that our Sauiour Chriſt would haue
vs to aſke in our praiers of God his father:
for ſpeaking of praier to his diſciples, he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
that God his Father is moſt ready to
giue vs our requeſts, as ſoone as we aſke of
him: as our earthly father is willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
that vpon vs which he is able to giue.
And of all other things that God giueth, he
maketh mention of this ſpirit, ſaying, <hi>If ye
which are euill, can giue good giftes vnto
your children, how much more ſhall your
heauenly Father giue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that deſire him? Luk.</hi> 11. Signifying this
Spirite to be the excellenteſt gift that God
coulde giue, or we deſire of him. We haue
nowe heard the meaning of this article, <hi>of
the holy Ghoſt,</hi> what it is, and what are
the wonderfull and comfortable effectes of
it in the Church, and howe the Lorde hath
<pb facs="tcp:10917:114"/>
promiſed neuer to leaue his deſtitute of it
vnto the worlds ende: We haue ſeene alſo
howe we muſt beleeue in him, as the true
and euerlaſting God, equally proceeding
from the Father and the Sonne, becauſe he
is the power and vertue, whereby they doe
worke and create all things. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this heauenly ſpirit is ſo neceſſarie and
ſo great a treaſure, let vs that are true
Chriſtians moſt duetifully thanke our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Father, for beſtowing of him vpon
his whole familie here in earth, and vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one of vs that are his ſeruants, wherby
we are knowen in the worlde, and among
our ſelues, that wee are his owne. And let
vs alſo pray vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt,
the ſender of this holy ſpirit, to kindle and
ſtirre him vp in our heartes dayly more and
more, that by his aſſiſtance, we may haue an
earneſt feeling and lothing of our ſinnes,
and ſo bee brought to doe his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
with a carefull keeping of all his
commaundements, vntill we all come to
a full perfection in Ieſus Chriſt, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that hope which is layde vp for vs in the
newe and heauenly Ieruſalem, which
Chriſt hath purchaſed full dearely for vs,
with his owne precious heart blood. To
<pb facs="tcp:10917:115"/>
whom with his Father, and the holy ghoſt,
three perſons in trinitie, and yet one God
in vnitie, be rendred all prayſe, honour,
glorie and thankes giuing, both nowe and
for euermore, Amen.</p>

fayth: the fyrſt, wherein we
doe beleeue and confeſſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to bee the Creator and maker of all
things: the ſeconde part, wherein we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Sonne Ieſus Chriſt the
redeemer of mankinde: the thirde ſheweth
vnto vs the holy Ghoſt, the comforter of
our heartes, and the confirmer of all theſe
things which are conteyned in theſe former
eyght articles, which we haue proued all
out of the euerlaſting worde of GOD.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:115"/>
Nowe followeth conſequently the fourth
part of our Chriſtian beliefe, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Church, the ninth article with
other three which are annexed vnto the
Church, as the eſpeciall bleſſings and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
which flowe and iſſue out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
partes, and alwayes doe accompanie
and followe the ſpouſe of Chriſt. The
cauſes and matter of our ſaluation being
alreadie handled, the effect doeth followe,
which is the Church: Otherwiſe in vayne
ſhoulde God create, and Chriſt redeeme,
and the holy Ghoſt inſpire and confirme
theſe benefites and giftes, vnleſſe there
were ſome that myght bee partakers of
thoſe treaſures, brought out and founded
by the bleſſed Trinitie. Againe, ſeeing
the kingdome of Chriſt is euerlaſting, it
is very neceſſarie and requiſite, that there
be alwayes ſome which may acknowledge
him for their King and gouernour. To this
ende hath Chriſt his continuall Church,
and ſhall haue to the ende of the worlde, as
he hath had euer from the firſt beginning.
The meaning therefore of this article, is
this: I beleeue that God almightie hath
alwayes had from the firſt creation of the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:116"/>
worlde, and hath preſently, and ſhall haue
vnto the conſummation of the worlde, his
Church here in earth, which is, <hi>the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Saints,</hi> that is to ſay, a company and
congregation of faythfull men and women,
which doe truely beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt,
acknowledging him for their onely Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and ſeruing him according to his
worde, receyuing his Sacraments, and
taking holde of all his mercies and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
by fayth onely in his blood: and for
this cauſe doe wee beleeue that there is but
one true Catholique Church, and no moe
which ſhall continue for euer, although
Satan and his miniſters goe about by
all meanes poſſible to ouerthrowe and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
it. Wee are then taught here to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that there is <hi>an vniuerſall Church</hi> of
Chriſt, and not to beleeue and truſt in it, as
we doe in God: for that were idolatrie, to
truſt in men and put our confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in them.
But wee muſt truſt in GOD onely,
and not in this Church, as the Papiſtes
woulde beare vs in hande: becauſe the
Church is but the company of the elect and
choſen, and are men. Nowe wee can not
beleeue and put our hope in any thing
<pb facs="tcp:10917:116"/>
that is a creature, for that were blaſphemie
to ſay, and wee are alſo accurſed if wee do
ſo, as the holy Prophete Ieremie hath by
the mouth of the holy Ghoſt forewarned
vs, ſaying, <hi>Thus ſayth the Lorde, Curſed
bee the man that truſteth in man, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
fleſh his arme, and withdraweth his
heart from the Lorde: for hee ſhall be like
the heath in the wildernes, and ſhall not
ſee when any good commeth, but ſhall
inhabite the parched places in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
in a ſalte lande and not inhabited,</hi>
Ier. 17. By theſe woordes then of the holy
ghoſt, we learne, not to beleeue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church,
but that there is an holy Church of Chriſte
in this worlde euery where diſperſed and
ſcattered abroad through the face of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole
earth. This article doeth declare vnto vs
what the Church is, terming it the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saintes, or fellowſhippe
of the godly, eyther with Chriſt, or els with
themſelues in loue: furthermore what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Church this is, is here likewiſe ſet
downe, that it is holy, by reaſon of Chriſt her
head: &amp; catholike, becauſe it is not tied to any
one place, as Rome, but generally is in all
places of the earth, toſſed as a ſhip vpon the
ſea fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one coaſt to another, as pleaſeth God
<pb facs="tcp:10917:117"/>
to diſpoſe of it. To theſe things, two other
pointes may be adioyned, to make vp the
perfit diſcourſe of it, and to the which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinges incident to any maner queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church, may bee eaſely referred.
The one is, to conſider who is the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
head and gouernour of this catholique
Church: the other, by what true markes,
notes, ſignes, and titles, this Church may
be knowen, and diſcerned from the falſe and
counter faite ſynagogue of Satan, that is,
from the whoriſhe and Babylonicall ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
of Rome, which falſly taketh vpon her
the name of this chaſte wife and ſpouſe of
Chriſte, being an vncleane and a moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterous
harlot, which hath long agoe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
her bridegrome Ieſus Chriſt, as
it ſhall (God willing) hereafter better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
in the diſcourſe and tract of this
matter. Seeing the Church is likened
to an houſe, 1. Timothie 3. <hi>and euery
houſe is builded and gouerned of ſome
man,</hi> Hebr. 3. it is neceſſarie that this houſe
alſo, which is the Church of the liuing God,
haue ſome builder &amp; head of it to looke vnto
it, which is both able to do it, &amp; moſt ready to
helpe it. <hi>The builder of this Chruch is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 16. 18. &amp; he is the only head
<pb facs="tcp:10917:117"/>
of it, as S. Paul doth proue moſt manifeſtly
vnto vs, both in the 1. &amp; 4. chap. of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> epiſtle
of the Epheſians, and the 1. chapter to the
Coloſ. ſaying, <hi>God hath made all thinges
ſubiect vnder his feet, and hath giuen him
ouer al thinges to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head to the Church,
which is his body, euen the fulneſſe of him
that filleth all in al things.</hi> And againe, <hi>Let
vs folow the trueth in loue, and in al things
growe vp vnto him, which is the head, that
is Chriſt, by whom all the body being cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
and knit together by euery ioynt, for
the furniture thereof, according to the
effectuall power which is in the meaſure
of euery part, receyueth increaſe of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> edifiyng of it ſelfe in loue,</hi> Ephe.
4. So in the Coloſ. 1. 18. <hi>He is the head of
the body of the Church.</hi> Out of this doeth
the body of Chriſt which is his Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
a ſpecial and ſinguler comfort againſt
al te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tations, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhalbe defended &amp; preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for euer: for Chriſt ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not forſake his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not but loue it, &amp; nouriſh it, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe
ſpiritual graces which come &amp; proceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head &amp; fountaine. For as we ſee in the
body naturall, how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the head receiueth not
meate for it ſelfe, but for the cheriſhing and
increaſing of the ſtrength of the body, and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:118"/>
the reſt of the members: ſo the Lorde Ieſus
is not an head for himſelf, but for vs, neyther
hath hee receyued all power and authoritie
of his father, with the fulneſſe of the holy
Ghoſt, to keepe it to him ſelfe, but to giue
and to impart it moſt louingly and liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his true members, to make them to
grow vp more and more, till they come to a
perfection in him. If Chriſt therefore haue
ſtrength, holineſſe, power, and all other
good giftes and graces of the ſpirite, then
may the Church aſſure her ſelfe of them all,
becauſe the wife may recken that all
the goodes and landes of her huſbande are
hers: and wee knowe that the Church hath
this dignitie and prerogatiue, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable
and full of wonderfull loue, that
ſhee is counted and called, as ſhee is in very
deede, the chaſte wife and ſpouſe of Chriſte
here vpon the earth, to whome hee is ioyned
with the coniunction and fellowſhippe of
his heauenly ſpirite. <hi>I haue</hi> (ſayth Paul)
<hi>prepared you for one huſband, to preſent
you as a pure virgin vnto Chriſt,</hi> 2. Corin.
11. Cantic. 4. Ezechiel 16. Epheſians 5.
What noble man will bee content to take
a poore wretched beggerwoman out of
the ſtreetes, full of ragges and filthineſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:118"/>
to make her his wife? And yet the Lorde
Ieſus hath done greater thinges in mercie
for vs, then this: <hi>for when hee paſſed by,
hee looked vpon vs, and beholde, our
tyme was as the time of loue, hee ſpredde
his ſkirtes ouer vs and couered our filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
yea, hee ſware vnto vs, and entred
into couenant with vs, and we became
his owne.</hi> So is the Lorde in mariage
become nowe our head, and wee his ſpouſe:
let vs then take heede that wee admitte no
others into his loue, or defile our ſelues
with whoredome and idolatrie, in giuing
our faith and allegeance to ſtraungers and
falſe goddes, whome wee knowe not. Our
huſbande is very ielous ouer vs: hee can
not abide another man to bee admitted vnto
his bedde, for that were ſpirituall fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and adulterie before him, which hee
wyll puniſhe moſt ſeuerely, as hee did in
the Iſraelites which brake couenant with
him, and betooke them ſelues to Idoles,
and bowed downe to them in ſteade of him,
as the Prophete declareth, Ezechiel 16.
Seeyng then Chriſt is appoynted the head
of his Church, and that one wife (as there
is but one bodie, which is the Church)
can haue but one huſbande to bee her head,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:119"/>
and one houſe, but one Lorde and maſter to
rule it: what wickedneſſe is it to ſay that
the Pope of Rome is an vniuerſall head
ouer the Church? Is not this to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Chriſtes roome and dignitie, or rather
is it not to make the Church a monſter to
haue two heades in one body? But they ſay
that the Byſhope of Rome is the viſible
heade in Chriſtes ſteade: but this they can
not ſhewe by Scripture, neither doeth the
Church require any ſuch heade: for Chriſt
is preſent with it, as he hath promiſed, <hi>Mat.
28. I am with you alwayes, euen vnto
the ende of the worlde.</hi> If the Pope be a
viſible heade, why is he not ſeene of al men?
why doeth he not gouerne all men in the
Church, and giue nouriſhment vnto them,
as the heade ought to doe? This he doth
not: wherefore he is no viſible heade, as he
doth pretende. And ſurely to be the general
head ouer al, is too great a matter &amp; enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
for any mortal man to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. I
am ſure the Pope will graunt him ſelfe to
be a member of this <hi>Catholike Church:</hi> If
hee then bee a member, howe can hee be an
head, except the ſame thing ſhalbe both an
heade and member, which is very abſurde &amp;
monſtruous? If he ſay, that as he is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:119"/>
Chriſt is his head only, and not another:
why ſhall not Chriſt bee as well a head for
all? Theſe thinges (wee ſee) are very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
and fonde. But yet they apply and ſay,
that Chriſt ſayde to Peter, <hi>Thou art Peter,
and vpon this rocke will I builde my
Church.</hi> Firſt note, hee ſayth not vpon
thee Peter will I builde, but vpon this
rocke, meaning, the fayth of Peters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
which confeſſed him to be Chriſt:
therefore by the rocke hee meant himſelfe.
For when Peter had ſayd, <hi>Thou art Chriſt
the ſonne of God,</hi> Chriſt ſayd to him, <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this rocke will I builde my Church:</hi> and
in that place hee giueth no more to Peter
in the keys, which is the binding and loſing
of ſinners, then he giueth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al els where,
as in Ioh. 20. when he ſaid, <hi>Receiue the holy
Ghoſt: whoſoeuers ſinnes ye remit, they are
remitted, &amp; whoſoeuers ſinnes ye reteyne,
they are reteyned.</hi> Here all haue as much
as Peter: and if they will beleeue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which they brag of much, they do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
referre this vnto Peter alone, but to the
reſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoſtles &amp; to al faithful miniſters of
Ieſus Chriſt. As Orige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his 1. homi. vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Mat. &amp; ſo doth Cyprian, Ambroſe, Ierome,
&amp; Auguſtine. And what hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pope to do w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10917:120"/>
theſe woordes, which followeth not Peter,
neyther in life nor doctrine? A ſtrange thing
it is to ſee, how they builde their kingdome
vpon Peter, and whatſoeuer is ſaide of him,
they take it to them ſelues. But before they
can prooue any thing in deede, they muſt
prooue theſe three poyntes vnto vs, if they
wil haue the Pope to be the ſupreme head of
the whole Church, which they ſhall be neuer
able to doe by the ſcriptures, as long as they
liue. Firſt, they muſt prooue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter was
chiefe and head of all the Apoſtles. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he was at Rome, and ſate there as
Biſhop generall. Thirdly, that hee left all
the title and preeminence of this ſeate to his
ſucceſſours whatſoeuer. If they prooue the
two firſt poyntes, (as they can not) yet
they make nothing againſt vs, although we
ſhoulde graunt it them, vnles they proue the
third, (which they ſhall neuer be able to do)
that Peter hath left all his authoritie to his
ſucceſſours after him for euer. Foraſmuch
then as the Pope neither is nor ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be any ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
head to this Church, but Chriſte
Ieſus alone, which is alwayes preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it, &amp;
euer walketh in the midſt of the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> golden
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dleſticks, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he needeth no vicar general,
or vniuerſal B. let vs, dearly beloued, as we
<pb facs="tcp:10917:120"/>
loue the Lorde Ieſus our head, and tender
the ſaluation of our owne ſoules, flee farre
from the Pope and all his adherents, tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
decrees and pardons, leſt hee make
marchandiſe alſo of our ſoules, as he doth
of a great many, both in Rome &amp; Spaine,
and els where. This being ſet downe as a
moſt certaine and ſure principle, that <hi>Chriſt
is the head of this church,</hi> it would be ſeene
what authoritie this church hath, and what
rule or power is graunted vnto it. If the
Papiſtes will graunt, (as they can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but) that this church is the wife, &amp; chaſte
and obedient ſpouſe to her Lorde and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
Ieſus Chriſt: If (I ſay) they will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
this, this controuerſie betweene them
and vs, of the authoritie of the Churche,
whether it be greater then the ſcriptures,
and worde of Chriſt, ſhall not bee hard to
diſcuſſe, but ſoone ended. For what authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
&amp; iuriſdiction a wiſe man wil graunt to
his wife vnder him, that libertie is to bee
graunted to the church vnder Chriſt. If it
be reaſon and iuſt, that a wife ſhoulde not
controll, or be ſuperior, and aboue her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes
worde and commaundement, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a wiſe and diſcrete huſbande, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
and commaunde her: then is it no
<pb facs="tcp:10917:121"/>
reaſon or right (whatſoeuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papiſts ſay) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
the authoritie of the church, which is the
wife, ſhould be greater and of more force,
then the woorde and will of the huſbande
Chriſt, ſeeing that <hi>S. Paul ſaith, Eph. 5. 24.
that the church is in ſubiection to Chriſt,</hi>
and from thence draweth an argument of
the obedience and ſubiection of wiues to
their huſbands, which ſurely can not be ſo
in euery thing, as Paul there willeth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Church bee in ſubiection, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the authoritie of the will and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of the huſbande in all things. If
they will not permit, but thinke it vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
vnles they goe againſt ſcripture,
that the wiues authoritie ſhould bee either
equall or ſuperiour to the huſband, why
then doe they ſuffer and teache, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and conſtitutions of the churche, to
make articles, lawes, ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and other
rites and ceremonies, are aboue the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the written worde? and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
aboue Chriſt him ſelfe, which can
not be ſeparated from his worde and will,
which hee will haue vs to receiue as him
ſelfe? For ſpeaking of his Apoſtles and
other miniſters, that brought his worde to
the people, he ſaith, <hi>He that receiueth you,
receiueth me, and hee that deſpiſeth you,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:121"/>
deſpiſeth me.</hi> And therefore, when the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries
ſaye, that the authoritie of the
Church is greater then the woorde and
ſcriptures of God, what doe they ſaye els,
but that man is aboue God, &amp; the wife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the huſband? The one is blaſphemy,
and the other abſurde. Wee ſee then by
theſe thinges, that the authoritie of the
church, is to obey Chriſt in all things, and
to doe ſuch workes and buſines as he hath
commanded in his worde, except it bee in
indifferent matters, not repugning vnto
the worde, nor hindering godlines, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
voyde of ſuperſtition, and without
clogge of conſcience. The <hi>Church</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
and likened to <hi>an houſe, 1. Timoth.</hi> 3
or to a <hi>family:</hi> and ſhall the houſhold and
family be aboue the authoritie and will of
the maſter? ſhall the ſeruantes and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
haue greater authoritie in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
then the Lorde and father of the
houſe? Howe doe theſe thinges agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?
And howe hath Satan (the God
of this worlde) blynded the eyes of the
Pope and his ſhauelings, that the light of
the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt ſhoulde not
ſhine vnto them? But let vs heare their
proofes and arguments for this authoritie.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:122"/>
The church (ſay they) hath allowed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
the ſcriptures, &amp; diſcerned the falſe
from the true, admitting the Goſpell of
Matthewe, Marke, Luke, and Iohn, and
reiecting the Goſpell of Nicodenius, and
Thomas with others: therefore it is aboue
the ſcriptures. A goodly argument and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
As if they ſhould argue thus: I doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
and approue the authoritie of the
prince, therefore I am greater and aboue
her authoritie. If they would make this
reaſon with her, as they make the like with
Ieſus Chriſt, they might (peraduenture)
come ſhort home, and be found traitours to
her, (as in the ſupremacie of the Pope they
all are, if they holde their owne doctrine &amp;
mainteine it,) as they are to Ieſus Chriſt,
their chiefe prince. Againe, one man telleth
another which is the king, and diſcerneth
him from one that is not the king: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he that doeth thus tel and diſcerne the
king from another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is greater then the
king in authoritie. This is their reaſon, &amp;
all one. The church (forſooth) becauſe it
hath diſcerned the true writings of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt, from thoſe that were cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfaite
and falſe, therefore they will haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church
to be aboue this worde: which is vtterly
<pb facs="tcp:10917:122"/>
falſe, and in no point foloweth. They might
by this reaſon proue them ſelues, or others
to be aboue God him ſelfe, becauſe many
can diſcerne and tyre the true and liuing
God from the forged and falſe gods, and
they can tyre and ſeparate the true ſpirite
from the lying ſpirite: therefore they are
greater in authoritie, then this ſpirite of
God is. Who ſeeth not theſe things to bee
ſo childiſh, that they neede no refutation at
all, becauſe if they be once examined by the
touchſtone, they fall of them ſelues, and do
eaſely deſcrie what they are? Well, let vs
holde this for a grounde moſt certaine and
ſure, which can not bee ſhaken: that <hi>the
worde which Chriſt hath ſpoken in his
fathers name, the ſame ſhall iudge in the
laſt day,</hi> as hee him ſelfe ſayth, <hi>Iohn. 12.
verſe</hi> 48. Then if the worde be iudge, it is
(belike) greater, and aboue them that muſt
be iudged by it (which is the church) in the
latter daye, euen as the iudge here is of
greater authoritie, then the partie whome
he iudgeth. And here by the way falleth to
the ground, another falſe poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theirs,
that ſay the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſcriptures
muſt be according to the church: nay it muſt
be according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, which is the iudge:
<pb facs="tcp:10917:123"/>
for if this be a matter of controuerſie, who
ſhall determine and decide it, but the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
iudge? as we ſee the lawes muſt bee
interpreted, not according to the cenſure
and iudgement of them to whome they
were giuen, but after the will and meaning
of the iudge and lawe giuer, which made
them: ſo the ſcriptures muſt bee interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the ſcriptures, and the worde, by the
worde, and that which is ſpoken obſcurely
in one place, by that which is declared and
vttered more plainely in an other place.
As for example: The papiſtes, to proue that
ſinnes may be forgiuen hereafter in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worlde, in their fayned purgatorie,
bring this place out of the 12. chapter of
Matthewe, where our ſauiour ſaith, that
<hi>he that ſpeaketh a worde againſt the holy
Ghoſt, ſhall not bee forgiuen, neither in
this worlde nor in the worlde to come:</hi>
Ergo ſay they, to eſtabliſh their purgatorie,
ſome ſinnes may be forgiuen after this life,
and where is that, but in purgatorie: but
if they had read the thirde of Marke (hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the ſame matter) and conferred one
place with an other, they ſhould haue ſeene
there, that our ſauiours meaning was to
ſhewe, that the horriblenes of this ſinne
<pb facs="tcp:10917:123"/>
was ſo great, that it ſhould neuer be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
for theſe are his verie wordes there.
<hi>Verely I ſay vnto you, al ſinnes ſhalbe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; blaſphemies,
wherewith they blaſpheme: but he that
blaſphemeth againſt the holy Ghoſt, ſhall
neuer haue forgiuenes, but is culpable of
eternall damnation, Mark.</hi> 3. So likewiſe
is that place in <hi>Matthewe</hi> of the keyes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
in <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. by remitting or retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of ſinnes by all the Apoſtles, and not
by Peter only. Nowe out of this note that
Chriſt is the head and only great ſhepheard
of his church, commeth forth many good &amp;
fruitfull branches for this whole church,
that is, many good leſſons for vs in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
&amp; maners: For if Chriſt be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of
this congregation, then it ſhalbe perpetual
and for euer, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of it is for euer,
therefore the body muſt be ſo alſo. As the
Lord promiſeth in <hi>Ieremie cha.</hi> 31. ſaying,
<hi>This ſaieth the Lorde, which giueth the
ſunne for a light to the day, and the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the moone and of the ſtarres a light
to the night, which breaketh the ſea when
the waues thereof roare, his name is the
Lord of hoſtes. If theſe ordinances depart
out of my ſight,</hi> (ſayeth the Lorde) <hi>then
<pb facs="tcp:10917:124"/>
ſhall the ſeede of Iſrael ceaſe from being a
nation before me for euer. Thus ſayth the
Lorde, If the heauens can be meaſured, or
the foundations of the earth be ſearched
out beneath: then will I caſt off all the
ſeede of Iſrael, for all that they haue done,
ſayth the Lorde.</hi> By the which wordes the
Lorde meaneth that his church ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
for euer, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſunne, moone &amp; ſtarres
doe: which ſurely is very comfortable to
all his, to conſider that they ſhall be for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
as their head is, and haue immortalitie
with him. Againe, if Chriſt be from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
then he hath had this church alſo
from the beginning: firſt in Adam, then in
Abel, and Seth, and ſo foorth in Noe. And
this he hath, and will preſerue: for they are
his members, whome he loueth, and feedeth
as a father doth his deare and owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>Pſalm.</hi> 103. And if Chriſt be the head
of it, it muſt needes be holy alſo, as here we
doe beleeue. For howe ſhould the body be
vnholy, when the head is ſo holy? although
this holines be not ful and perfite here, (for
the church is in a continuail warrefare and
fight againſt ſinne and wickedneſſe,) yet it
ſhall be perfited hereafter, when it ſhalbe
fully ioyned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her head in heauen. In the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:124"/>
meane ſeaſon it is called holy, becauſe it
contendeth for holineſſe, and becauſe the
holineſſe of Chriſt is imputed vnto it: but
this is not in it ſelfe: for the church is
taught to pray daily, <hi>Forgiue vs our treſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
and there is no man without ſinne
that liueth here in earth, 1. Ioh.</hi> 1. yea this
church may, and hath erred, as euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
particularly may erre, as <hi>Peter did in
the vocation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentiles, Act.</hi> 10. and in
diſſimulation, in eating with the Gentiles,
&amp; withdrawing himſelf from them againe,
when Iames came to him, and was iuſtly
therefore reprehended of <hi>Saint Paul, Gal.</hi>
2. Then if <hi>Peter erred,</hi> ſo notable &amp; ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
an Apoſtle, others may erre alſo, but yet
returne with Peter: yea the whole church
at ſome time haue erred, as al the Apoſtles
doubted of Chriſtes reſurrection, and yet
they were the Church of Chriſt, and the
beſt men and moſt perfite that were then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue,
<hi>Mark. 16. verſe</hi> 14. This I ſay to that
ende, that none ſhould imagine ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in the church, as the Anabaptiſts
doe and others, which can not be attayned
vnto in this life: And therefore becauſe
they ſee ſome abuſes, ſome diſſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and ſome errors in the Church (which
<pb facs="tcp:10917:125"/>
is like a field that hath corne and tares in
it) they by and by depart from it, and break
and diuide the vnitie of the Church, by
their ignorance and frowardneſſe, not
knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the kingdome of heauen (which
is the Church) is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared of Chriſt himſelf
to a net caſt into the Sea, that taketh both
good and bad fyſhes together in it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.
I ſpeake not this, to mayntayne any thing
that is amiſſe, if it may be reformed by
order. For I wiſh all thinges to be wel,
which are out of order in our church, and I
hope God will in his time cut off all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders:
but I ſpeake it to this ende, that
none ſhould ſeparate himſelf from hearing
the woorde and receauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacraments,
and from publicke prayers in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
If al things in the miniſtery be not
ſo perfect as euery goodman would deſire,
and as the word of God requireth it ſhould
bee, we muſt in deede contend and indeuour
for a perfection, as much as lyeth in vs,
which I pray God may be earneſtly ſought
for of euery one in his vocation. But they
that are priuate men, muſt helpe with their
prayers, their teares and groninges, and
muſt ſeeke to further this woorke by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
interceſſion to the Lorde, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:10917:125"/>
to leaue off, neyther to giue him any
reſt, vntill he repayre, and vntill hee ſet vp
Ieruſalem the prayſe of the worlde. And
ſo for Sions ſake, they muſt not holde
their tongue, vntil the righteouſneſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
breake foorth as a light, and the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof vs a burning lampe. Which
God put into the heartes and mindes of
them that haue authoritie in the buylding
and repairing of this ſpiritual Church vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord. For Chriſt himſelfe frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the temple at Hieruſalem, and there
taught the people his fathers wil, although
the hie Prieſts, the Scribes, and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
had made it a de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of theeues, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
corrupted all things in it, both by
their doctrine, and alſo by their manners:
neither did <hi>Paul</hi> ſeparate himſelfe from
the church of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> although
many abuſes had crept in among them, in
ſo much, that ſome denied the reſurrection,
the chiefeſt poynt one of them in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie,
yet notwithſtanding all this, hee
called it a Church, and the Corinthians
ſanctifyed in Ieſus Chriſt. And ſo wee ſee
he did not withdrawe himſelfe from them,
but vouchſafed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:126"/>
and goeth about (as wee ſhould all doe,) to
bring them to the purity of the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
Thus much for this poynt: let vs
returne to our purpoſe. Chriſt being the
head of this church, it ſhall not be hard for
vs to diſcerne who are the members of it,
and who appertayne vnto the ſame. This
<hi>church</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>holy,</hi> and the <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of ſayntes:</hi> then all they that are holy,
&amp; ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of Ieſus Chriſt, are of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation: for if they wil
be of his body, they muſt haue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which hath ſaid. <hi>Be ye holy, for I am
holy:</hi> &amp; they ought to reſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble him in their
life &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in godlines, in integrity,
in innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie &amp; al other chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vertues. We
ſee then howe we onght to endeuour to be
like him, &amp; theſe are the words of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi>
where that he ſayth, <hi>He that remayneth in
him, ought euen ſo to walke, as hee hath
walked:</hi> That is, he muſt be incorporated &amp;
ingrafted to the body of Chriſt, otherwiſe
there is no ſaluation for him. <hi>He is the true
vine, and we are the branches: if we abide
in him, we bring forth much fruite,</hi> &amp; wee
ſhalbe purged to bring forth more fruite:
but as the branche, except it abide in the
vine, dieth &amp; withereth away without any
<pb facs="tcp:10917:126"/>
fruit, and is caſt into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fire: ſo is euery one,
that is not of the body of Ieſus Chriſt. Let
vs therefore indeuour to be of this body, for
without the Church is no ſaluation, as all
periſhed by the waters, which were not in
the arke of Noe, which was a true ſigne
and figure of the church, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. And as the
hand cut off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body, dieth, and lacketh
life: ſo it is in the myſticall body of the
Church, no lyfe without the body of Chriſt:
and that is the thing that is meant in theſe
places of holy ſcripture. In the thirteenth
chapter of Ezechiel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord threatneth the
falſe prophets, that his hand ſhalbe vpon
them that ſee vanity, &amp; deuine lyes, ſaying,
<hi>They ſhall not be in the aſſembly of my
people, neither ſhal they be written in the
writing of the houſe of Iſrael, neither ſhal
they enter into the land of Iſrael.</hi> Wherby
he excludeth them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his church. So it is
ſaid in Ioel the ſecond, <hi>In mount Sion and
Ieruſalem ſhalbe deliuerance, as the Lord
hath ſayde.</hi> The like is in Abdie: but moſt
notable is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place in the ſecond of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Acts,
where it is ſayd, that <hi>the Lorde added to
the church from day to day, ſuch as
ſhoulde be ſaued:</hi> giuing vs thus much to
vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnles they be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, there
<pb facs="tcp:10917:127"/>
is no ſaluation for them. By this then we
gather, that if they only be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of this
church, which beleeue in Chriſt, and are
holy, then the Turkes &amp; Iewes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
not in Chriſt, but perſecute him moſt
deadly, are not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, becauſe they are
not vnited &amp; ioyned to this body. Likewiſe
all the Heretikes, which haue broken the
vnity &amp; peace of this Church, ſome by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the humanitie of Chriſt, and ſome
his diuinitie, are not to be counted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Chriſt, neither they that haue depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the felowſhip of the godly and
ſayntes of God to Antichriſt, can haue any
part in this congregation, or be heyres of
life, vnles they returne againe with ſpeede
to the Church. Here likewiſe are all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts</hi>
and vngodly liuers ſhut out from
this church. For they communicate not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
the ſaintes, either in life or doctrine, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe they relieue the poore and afflicted
members of Ieſus Chriſt with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſings
which God hath beſtowed vpon them:
ſo that there is no communion of brotherly
loue among them, whereby they ſhould be
knowen to be of this holy body. Now y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we
know that Chriſt is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of this church,
(as is proued) let vs come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d point,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:127"/>
to ſee by what markes and tokens this true
church may be diſcerned from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falſe &amp; hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocricall
ſinagogue of Satan. For this
ſtandeth vs greatly in hand to know, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
we may be deceiued in taking the one
for the other. Two ſignes there are wherby
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Chriſt is knowen: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one is the
<hi>preaching of the word of God,</hi> contained
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old &amp; new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; is deuided into
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law &amp; Goſpel: ſo that where this word is
ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded out by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preachers, purely &amp; ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out mixture &amp; corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
&amp; receaued reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, there is no doubt
the church of Chriſt, as Chriſt himſelf doth
witnes, <hi>My ſheepe here my voice &amp; follow
me.</hi> This is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt &amp; principal note of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
church, to heare Chriſts word, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. and
where this word wanteth, there can be no
church. <hi>For Chriſt doth ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctifie &amp; clenſe it
by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waſhing of water through the word,
Eph.</hi> 5. This made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophets in olde time
to be careful y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they brought nothing but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
word of God to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, ſaying. <hi>Heare the
worde of the Lord. The mouth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord
hath ſpoken:</hi> and alwaies they brought the
people when they were gone aſtray, to this
worde &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the Lord. This
made <hi>S. Paul</hi> to ſay, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                     <hi>he had deliuered no
other thing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:128"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he had receyued of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, 1. Cor.</hi>
11. Neither did Chriſt, when he ſent his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
abroad to preach, giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liberty to
preach what they liſt: <hi>But go and preach,</hi>
(ſayth hee,) <hi>teaching them to obſerue all
things, whatſoeuer I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded you:</hi>
reſtraining the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alwaies to his word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> church is gathered together, not the
word vnwritten, which they call vnwritten
verities, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> traditions of the Apoſtles, and
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> church, but the word written only. For of
the other wee haue no certainty, yea their
vnwritten verities are againſt the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
veritie and worde of Chriſt, which is a
thing very abſurde. For the worde written
doeth allowe all meates to be eaten with
thankeſgiuing without choyſe, any apparel
to be worne without differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: neither doth
it condemne matrimonie in any degree or
eſtate of perſons, as they do in the miniſters
of the woorde. Now their vnwritten veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
doe forbid al theſe things, and a great
many moe, which are contrary to the word
reueiled. Wel, let vs holde this poynt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
<hi>that the worde truely preached, is
the firſt note to know this church by:</hi> the
other note is the true vſe &amp; adminiſtration
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:128"/>
which are two in number: the one is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
wherein we are admitted into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhippe
of this Church of Chriſt, and by
the which we are aſſured of the remiſſion of
our ſinnes by Chriſtes blood, as wee are
ſure, that the water doeth outwardly waſh
the body and ſpottes of the fleſh. This Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
doth Paul call <hi>the waſhing of the
new byrth, Titus</hi> 5. and ſayth, that all they
that are baptized vnto Chriſt, haue put on
Chriſt. Furthermore the Lord Ieſus doeth
not thinke it ſufficient, or ynough to admit
vs onely into his houſe and familie, by this
ſigne of Baptiſme, but doeth alſo being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
feede vs continually with heauenly
and ſpirituall foode vnto euerlaſting life,
which is done with the other Sacrament of
his precious body &amp; blood, called the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
or the Lordes Supper. So that as
the ſhephearde doeth not onely gather his
ſheepe into his folde or ſheepecote, but doth
alſo prouide meat for them, and paſture: and
as the maſter doeth not onely enterteine his
ſeruant into his ſeruice, by giuing him his
liuery coate and badge, whereby he is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowen to be his man, but doeth prouide
and giue him meate &amp; drinke dayly to feede
him: ſo ſurely doth the Lord with vs in theſe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:129"/>
Sacramentes. For by Baptiſme doeth he
admit vs to his ſeruice, and by the Supper
doeth he feede vs, that wee periſh not with
hunger. So that where wee ſee theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes
duely adminiſtred, without any
inuentions of mans witte or brayne, the one
with the word and water, the other with the
worde, and bread and wine, without other
ſuperſtions and additions, there we may
acknowledge the Church of Chriſt to bee
preſent, and he in the middeſt of them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his worde, as hee hath promiſed,
<hi>Where two or three are gathered together
in my name, there am I in the middes of
them, Matth.</hi> 18. Now theſe Sacraments
are in ſome thinges vnlike. Concerning
the firſt, which is Baptiſme, it is to bee
vſed but once of a Chriſtian man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and not often: as the Iewes vſed but
once to circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſe their children, which Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
was a ſigne of our Baptiſme,
which we haue in ſteade of it: ſo this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
of infantes is not to bee iterated.
For euen as a man is borne but once, ſo
once baptizing is ſufficient, to ſignifie
our newe byrth in Chriſt. Therefore they
were ouerſeene, which woulde haue it to
bee iterated and done agayne, as Saint
<pb facs="tcp:10917:129"/>
Cyprian was in that errour. The other
Sacrament muſt bee often vſed of euery
Chriſtian man and woman, as the Iewes
vſed many times and often, euery yeere to
eate the Paſchall Lambe or Paſſeouer: ſo
muſt wee alſo often reſort to the Lordes
Table, but ſtill with reuerence, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and faith to eate and feede ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
vpon Ieſus Chriſt his body and blood.
For this Sacrament came in the place of
the Paſſeouer: ſo that as they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
their comming and deliuerie from the
bondage and thraldome of Egypt and
Pharao by this Lambe: In like ſort muſt
wee remember by this Sacrament our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
by Chriſt from the deuill and
hell, from the ſlauery of ſinne, whereof
the Iewes deliueraunce both in Egypt and
Babylon, were moſt liuely ſignes and
figures vnto our eyes, to beholde that
which Chriſt hath done for vs in <hi>dying
for our ſinnes vpon the croſſe, that wee
might bee made righteous in him, 1.
Corinth.</hi> 1. Nowe the oftener wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber
this which is done, eſpecially in the
Communion, the better it is for vs, alwaies
remembring this, that wee come thither
<pb facs="tcp:10917:130"/>
with examination of our ſelues, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
willeth, leaſt we come to iudgement
and condemnation. This then is not to be
done at Eaſter onely, as the blinde cuſtome
of the Papiſts was, but at other times alſo,
except they wil make it ſufficient for a man
to eate once in a yeere, to feede his bodie:
wherefore as we often vſe to eate corporall
and earthly foode to feede the body, which
otherwiſe would ſtarue: ſo muſt we freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
this Supper, which is holy, many times &amp;
often to feede our ſoule, which is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
then the feeding of the body: and the
meate of the one muſt bee had, and a great
deale ſooner then the prouiſion of the other,
I meane, of the body, which is but mortall.
Theſe are the outward ſignes, whereby the
Church of Chriſt may bee knowen from
the temple of idoles. I am not ignorant that
there are other ſignes, as the holy Ghoſt,
and faith, which becauſe they are inwarde,
and knowen to God, and euery mans owne
conſcience, I let them paſſe, I onely ſpeake
here of the viſible ſignes and markes of the
church, whereby it is manifeſted vnto men,
ſuch as the worde and Sacramentes be. If
then theſe be the ſignes of true Chriſtians,
let vs that are Engliſh men, vſe them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:130"/>
let vs in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon
heare the worde, &amp; with reuerence embrace
it, &amp; let vs withal confirme it in our hearts,
as with a ſeale, by the reuerent receiuing of
the ſacraments of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.
This ground being layde, that the Church
is knowen by the worde of Chriſt, and his
Sacramentes beyng vſed as hee ordayned
them, we can not acknowledge the Church
of Rome to be this Catholike Church of
Chriſt: for ſhee hath not theſe markes in her
forehead. For it is moſt manifeſt, that ſhee
hath burned this worde of Chriſt in the fire,
and refuſed it, and in ſteade of it ſette vp the
worde of man, the decrees of Popes, and
conſtitutions of their owne, as the liues of
Saintes in their Legende, which is full of
abominable lies: they mainteyne their own
traditions aboue this worde, and haue them
in greater eſtimation: ſo that the neglect
of their owne trumpery, as to eate fleſh in
Lent, or to breake their faſting dayes, is
more ſeuerely puniſhed by them, and made
a greater matter then the open contempt of
Gods Lawes: For the adulterie of their
Prieſtes, Friers, and their Nunnes, was
counted but a light matter, &amp; no ſinne with
them. Here we ſee what all the worlde may
<pb facs="tcp:10917:131"/>
iudge of them, and theſe thinges to bee
true, experience it ſelfe doeth teſtifie. And
if at any time they gaue the people the
worde, which is called of Paul the <hi>ſworde
of God,</hi> wherewith all Chriſtians ought
to fight, and therefore ſhoulde be common
as well to the laytie as the Cleargie, as
they tearme them: If, I ſaye, they gaue
it at any time vnto them, yet they gaue
it as a ſworde in the ſheath, that is, in the
Latine tongue, wherein they vnderſtoode
nothing at all, contrarie to the expreſſe
wordes of Paul, ſaying, <hi>That all thinges
ſhoulde bee done to edification in the
Church, and that hee had rather ſpeake
fiue wordes in a knowen tongue, then
fiue thouſande without the vnderſtanding
of the people, 1. Corinth.</hi> 14. I ſaye theſe
men are guyltie of the death of the Lordes
people, which ſende them out to fight with
their enemies, and yet take awaye their
weapons and ſwordes from them, and ſo
leaue them naked and bare to the ſpoyle
of the enemie. This did the Churche of
Rome, when it firſt tooke away here with
vs the ſcriptures and worde of God in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
from the people, and fedde them with
toyes &amp; fables of <hi>Beuis of South Hampton,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10917:131"/>
and ſuch like fabulous bookes, which were
inuented by the deuils inſtruments to keepe
the people from reading of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And no maruayle if they did ſo, that
is, take away the worde from them: for they
knewe well ynough, that if the people had
the Scriptures in their owne tongue, they
woulde quickly ſee and perceiue their kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
and treacherie, that they ſo cloſely v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in corners. But when they had put out
the candle, they played many ſluttiſh
partes, and no man ſawe them, although the
Lorde then winked not at them, but hath
in his good tyme diſcloſed them to their
ſhame, his name be prayſed therefore. We
ſee then, that this falſe church of Rome hath
dealt with the Scriptures and the people,
as the Philiſtins handled Samſon, for they
put out his eyes, and then they led him whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they woulde: ſo the Papiſtes, when
they had ſubtilly put out the eyes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in taking from them the light of Gods
worde, and the Goſpell of Chriſt: they
brought them where they liſted, &amp; made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
beleeue what they woulde. They thought
good to be ill, &amp; ill good, they called ſweete
ſowre, and ſowre ſweete: light darkeneſſe,
and darkeneſſe lyght: and all becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:132"/>
they had not the <hi>word, which was the true
light vnto their paths, and a lanterne vnto
their feete, Psal.</hi> 119. Then was it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thought good and godly to goe on pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
to offer to Saintes, to praye to
them, to haue images in Churches, to beare
candles, to kiſſe the Pax, to goe on proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with a thouſand ſuch trumperies, which
we were delited with, as yong children in
toyes and trifles: whereas now we willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne them, and are aſhamed of them,
becauſe we haue the light, which hath made
them manifeſt, and ſheweth vnto vs, that we
henceforth be no more children, wauering &amp;
caryed about with euery winde of doctrine,
by the deceite of men, and with craftineſſe,
whereby they lye in wayte to deceyue vs:
<hi>But let vs follow the trueth in loue, and in
all things grow vp into him, which is the
head, that is Chriſt, Ephes. 4. ver. 14. &amp;</hi> 15.
By theſe thinges we ſee, that <hi>Rome</hi> is not
the true Church, becauſe it hath forſaken
the worde of God, whereby the Church is
gathered together, as men to battell, by the
ſound of a drumme or trumpet. Nowe as
they haue done in the word in mangling it,
ſo haue they in like maner corrupted and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the true vſe of the Sacramentes, both
<pb facs="tcp:10917:132"/>
in adding vnto them, and taking away from
them, not being contented with the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
and that order that Chriſt vſed them in.
To Baptiſme haue they added of their
owne, ſpittle, creame, and ſalt, with ſuch
like traſh: the cuppe haue they taken away
from the common people, and ſay it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned
for the Prieſtes onely, when as our
ſauiour Chriſt ſayde, <hi>Drinke ye all of this,
Matth.</hi> 26. They ſay, not al, but the Prieſts
onely: ſo that when Chriſt ſayth one thing,
they ſay another contrary vnto it. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
they worſhip the bread, and ſay that it
is turned into the bodie of Chriſt, &amp; become
God, where they commit both idolatrie, in
worſhipping a creature, as the bread, and
blaſphemie, in that they ſay it is God. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then they haue not theſe marks for their
church, let vs ſee what markes they ſhewe
vnto vs. Firſt they ſay that their <hi>Vniuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie</hi>
or multitude, is a ſigne of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Church:</hi> but this is vtterly falſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
both by the teſtimonies and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the ſcriptures, and alſo by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
out of them. For firſt, if multitude
make the Catholike Church, then the
Turkes and Pagans ſhall be the Church,
ſooner and before the Papiſtes, as the euent
<pb facs="tcp:10917:133"/>
doeth ſhew, for they are moe in number then
the Chriſtians, or their pretended Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,
which yet I thinke they will not
graunt to be the Church. But they will ſay,
Among the Chriſtians the greateſt number
are the Church. If this be ſo, then ſayde
not our ſauiour Chriſt truely, when hee
called his Church <hi>a little flocke,</hi> ſaying:
<hi>Feare not little flocke, for it is your fathers
pleaſure to giue vnto you the kingdome,
Luke</hi> 12. He ſhoulde haue ſayde, great
flocke, according to the Papiſtes opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Againe, when one aſked our ſauiour
Chriſt, whether there were fewe that
ſhoulde be ſaued: hee anſwered in effect
that it was ſo, ſaying, <hi>Striue to enter in
at the ſtrayte gate, for many, I ſaye vnto
you, will ſeeke to enter in, and ſhall not
be able, Luke</hi> 13. Here Chriſt ſayeth flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that many, that is, the multitude, ſhall
not enter in at heauen gates, which yet
notwithſtanding muſt bee ſaued, if the
Church, as the aduerſaries ſaye, conſiſt
of multitude, for the Church ſhall bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
Here Chriſt excludeth multitude from
his Church and kingdome, and in the 7.
of Matthewe, wee ſhall ſee that hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
paucitie and the ſmall number to bee
<pb facs="tcp:10917:133"/>
an argument of his Church, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
vnto the blinde Papiſtes, ſaying,
<hi>Strayte is the gate, and narrowe is the
way that leadeth vnto life, and fewe there
be that finde it.</hi> Are there fewe that finde
this gate? then are there but fewe of this
Church of Chriſt. Wherefore wee haue
the more neede to watche, to ſtriue, and to
contende to be of this ſmall companie, for
ſurely many are called to the Goſpell, but
fewe, and very fewe are choſen. But let
vs ſee the examples of the holy Scripture.
Was not <hi>Noah</hi> onely founde righteous
with his houſholde before the Lorde, when
the flood was brought in vpon the wicked
worlde? <hi>For all fleſh had corrupted his
way before God, Genes.</hi> 6. Was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
multitude in Sodome founde to be of
this Church of God? Surely if it had
bene ſo, Sodome had not bene deſtroyed.
But there were not ten righteous men to
bee founde within it, onely Lot with his
wife and two daughters eſcaped the fire,
all the reſt were wicked, and therefore moſt
fearefully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed with fire and brimſtone
from heauen, to make others to feare th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
like ſinnes, as Saint Peter ſayeth, <hi>Gen.
19. 2. Peter</hi> 2. There came but two into
<pb facs="tcp:10917:134"/>
the promiſed lande of Canaan of all the ſixe
hundred thouſande men, beſide women and
children, that came out of the lande of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
and they were <hi>Ioſua</hi> and <hi>Caleb:</hi> the
reſt iuſtly periſhed in the wilderneſſe for
their vnbeliefe and diſobedience. But let vs
ſee further, when this Church was more
increaſed in the times that followed. Was
not <hi>Elias</hi> onely againſt the foure hundred
falſe prophetes of <hi>Achab</hi> and <hi>Iezabel? 3.
Reg.</hi> 18. And did not he thinke, that there
had bene none aliue that appertayned vnto
the Lorde, but he onely? And although the
Lorde ſayd vnto him, <hi>that he had reſerued
vnto himſelfe ſeuen thouſand, that had
not bowed the knee to the idole Baal:</hi> yet
was that to the multitude and number of
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wicked that were then in Iſrael? Againe,
was not the kingdom of Iſrael farre
greater then the kingdome of Iuda? and yet
was the true worſhippe and ſeruice of the
Lorde onely with the Iewes in Ieruſalem,
and not in Dan, or Bethel, where were the
golden calues of Ieroboam? Was not <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheas</hi>
in his time onely one Prophete that
was good, againſt foure hundred lying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
of Achab? He was ouercome there
by multitude, and yet hee had onely the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:134"/>
trueth and worde of the Lorde on his ſide,
3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 22. If wee liſt to come neerer the
time of Chriſt vnder the Goſpell, we ſhall
ſee the feweſt to holde with him. Was not
the whole multitude of the Iewes with
the chiefe Scribes, and Phariſes, and hye
Prieſtes againſt Chriſt, and condemned
him to death: <hi>crying, Crucifie him, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him, Iohn</hi> 19. Afterwarde in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the Church, wee ſhall ſee the
Chriſtians to bee the ſmalleſt number. <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſalitie</hi>
then and multitude, is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Catholike Church of Chriſt:
but rather the contrarie may bee affirmed,
the leaſt number to be his. Secondly they
will haue Antiquitie to bee a note and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of this Church: If they will ſtande
to Antiquitie, and long preſcript and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of time, euen here alſo muſt they
needes fall. For their Maſſe with her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
was neuer heard of within the ſpace
of fiue hundred yeeres at the leaſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Chriſt, as a godly and learned man
doeth auouche vnto them, which if they
coulde prooue: he woulde haue ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
vnto them: and their tranſſubſtantiation
was neuer ſpoken of, before the Council of
<hi>Lateran:</hi> and ſo all their trumpery hath bene
<pb facs="tcp:10917:135"/>
patched together by Popes and Councils
at diuers times. Whereas wee can prooue
our holy Communion euen from Chriſt
and his Apoſtles, vſing it in the ſame order
with bread and wine in a knowen tongue,
as he did to his Apoſtles. If their Maſſe be
of ſuch great antiquitie, as they beare vs in
hande, it is great maruayle that the very
name of it can not once be founde or read of
in the Scriptures: but it is an vnknowen
name, for an vnknowen thing. Here we ſee
antiquitie doeth confute them, although an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie
be not alwayes a good argument,
to prooue a matter by. For if it were, then
murder ſhoulde be good, which is as aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
as Cain the ſeconde man that was
here vpon the earth. Gen. 4. From the firſt
king of Iſrael, which was Ieroboam, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that the kingdome was deuided in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons
time) vntill the laſt king of the
ſame kingdome, which was Hoſhea, the
golden calues were ſtill mainteyned, which
were erected firſt of all by Ieroboam, and
continued for the ſpace of three hundred
yeeres, or there about. And yet for all
this, was not their religion good, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they receyued it ſtill by tradition &amp;
cuſtome from their fathers, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
<pb facs="tcp:10917:135"/>
of ſo many yeeres. For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
notwithſtanding did ſtill reprehende
the idolatrous and wicked kinges for their
ſuperſtitious worſhipping of theſe calues,
which they ſhoulde not haue done, if the
argument of our Papiſtes bee good, to
bring and alleadge their forefathers, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
traditions, Councils, and antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
for then Achab might haue ſayde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Elias, if this be true, why doeſt thou
reprehende me for this worſhippe? I haue
receyued it from the firſt king Ieroboam,
and my fathers haue liued and dyed in it,
and I haue antiquitie to pleade for mee.
But Elias knewe well ynough that this
was no argument, and therefore tooke him
vp ſharpely, as we may our Papiſtes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they haue had their Maſſes theſe
ſeuen or eyght hundred yeeres. Agayne,
if antiquitie or cuſtome bee a generall
rule to confirme a doctrine in religion,
then myght the Pagans and Ethnikes
haue alleadged agaynſt the Apoſtles theſe
thinges, when they came to preache Chriſt
Ieſus crucified vnto them, and to alter
their olde religion, wherein they had
continued ſo long. Wee ſee then that
<pb facs="tcp:10917:136"/>
antiquitie fauoureth them not at all, neither
yet can they father their Church and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which they haue at Rome, vpon the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
&amp; ordinarie deſcent of their Biſhops
and Popes, ſeeing trueth goeth not by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
&amp; inheritance, but by the grace and
mercy of God. But if ſucceſſion of biſhops,
and hie Prieſtes, as they fayne, from Peter
to this time, doeth prooue the Church by a
lineall deſcent to be with them: why then
ſhould not the hye Prieſts in Chriſtes time,
as <hi>Annas,</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ananias</hi> in the
time of the Apoſtles, be the true Church? for
they had their ſucceſſion from <hi>Aaron</hi> the
firſt hie Prieſt, ordayned by God himſelfe,
and might haue obiected this to Chriſt, and
did alſo, their lineall deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from Abraham:
and yet they were of the ſynagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
&amp; Chriſt doeth call them blinde guides,
generation of vipers, hypocrites &amp; fooles,
and doeth not take them for his Church, but
whippeth them all out of it rather. We ſee
then, that ſucceſſion is nothing to prooue
the Church by: for then the Scribes,
Phariſes, and hye Prieſtes ſhoulde haue
bene of the Church in Chriſtes time. They
obiect furthermore <hi>a generall conſent</hi> and
agreement, to prooue the Church vnto vs:
<pb facs="tcp:10917:136"/>
but we know that a conſent and agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
without God and this worde, is rather a
conſpiracy, then a conſent. But to cut off
this viſour alſo in a worde, was not there a
general co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of al the people of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Iewes,
with the chiefe elders alſo, the Scribes, the
Phariſees, the hie prieſts with Herode and
Pilate, in the time of Chriſt, to condemne
him, &amp; to crucifie him? For <hi>Luke</hi> reporteth
ſaying, <hi>The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the multitude cried at once,
ſaying, away with him, and deliuer to vs
Barabbas, and the voices of them, and of
the hie prieſtes preuailed, Luk.</hi> 23. Behold,
here was a whole and vniuerſall conſent &amp;
agreement, and yet for all that, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the trueth, euen Ieſus Chriſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of al trueth. But do they agree among
them ſelues? are they not at variance yet
what purgatorie ſhould be? ſome appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it to be fire, ſome water, ſome iſe and

about the matter of the ſacrament,
ſome holding that he is there onely in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,

And yet ſhall we thinke they doe agree, or
that they can not erre, or that theſe things
aboue rehearſed, as multitude, antiquitie,
with cuſtome, conſent, traditions, ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ancient fathers, generall councils, are
ſufficient proofes of the church to bee with
them: Councils haue erred, and bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>

of <hi>Nice</hi> the ſecond erected them, and
decreed that they ſhoulde bee had and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.
They alſo go about to proue their
church by the authoritie of Doctors of the
Churche: but it is manifeſt, that they
haue all erred, &amp; bin deceiued in ſome point
or other, yea euen of doctrine, ſo that they
are not to be rules &amp; notes, to knowe this
church by, for they are but men, &amp; haue now
or the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in doctrine, not only in maners ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

20. not wel vnderſtoode, where as hee
doth interprete that M. yeere, in another
place for euer, <hi>Reue. 22. Auguſtine</hi> thought
that all children dying without baptiſme,
were damned, which is an hereſie. <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
defendeth that it was a tradition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Apoſtles ſix dayes before Eaſter, to eate
nothing but bread and ſalt. <hi>Ierom</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the ſecond mariages of men, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them al (a thing moſt abſurde and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious)
no better then fornication. By theſe
things then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church is not diſcerned: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is glorie, pompe, honor, riches, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
beauty, and outward ſucceſſe and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,
any note of this church of Chriſt, as
the Papiſtes will beare vs in hande, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their gliſtering and glorious church
of Rome. The contrary thinges are
markes of Chriſts Churche, as pouertie,
affliction, no ſhewe to the eye, or any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
felicitie. For Chriſt hath ſayde, his
churche ſhall be vnder the croſſe, and not in
any beauty, or gorgeouſnes to the outward
eye of the worlde. The harlot &amp; ſtrumpet
<pb facs="tcp:10917:138"/>
goeth moſt commonly better trimmed and
decked in apparell, then the honeſt woman
and matrone of an houſe: &amp; ſo is the whoriſh
church of Rome, it hath all things for to
pleaſe well the outward ſenſes, &amp; to allure
men vnto her. It hath for the eare, her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
muſicke, ſinging, &amp; piping, &amp; organs,
and ringing of bels, and this in exceſſe alſo.
It hath for the noſe, ſweet ſmels, frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe,
and ſuch like. For the eyes, it hath to
pleaſe them, goodly copes, croſſes of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
and golde, pictures of Chriſt, and many
images of ſaintes, with ſuch like baggage,
and fooliſh traſhe: and for the belly to delite
idle lubbers, and loyterers, there was good
chere kept in abbeyes and monaſteries:
but in the meane ſeaſon, what was all this
to feede the hungry ſoules? ſurely nothing.
The worde of Chriſt was then gone from
them, yea, Chriſt him ſelfe was ſhut out
with them, and his mother Marie more
ſought to, more prayed to, and more eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
then he him ſelfe. Here were al things
for the body, and by this they would proue
vnto vs, that they were y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> true church. Wel,
if we would know the church, let vs thinke
it to be there where two or three are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together in Chriſtes name: and howe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:138"/>
ſhould they bee gathered together without
his word and commandement? And this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſaying of <hi>S. Auguſtine, If they
will here admit him. He that will knowe,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>which is the true church of Chriſt,
he can not know it by any other meanes,
then onely by the ſcriptures.</hi> We ſee here
how reſolute he is in this caſe. <hi>Ex homilia
49. operis imperfecti in Matth.</hi> And againe
he ſaith, <hi>Chriſtians willing to receiue the
ſtedfaſtnes of a true faith, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fly to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to the ſcriptures. Otherwiſe, if
they looke vnto other things, they ſhalbe
offended, and periſhe, not vnderſtanding
which is the true church, and ſo they ſhall
fall into the abomination of deſolation,
which ſtandeth in the holy places of the
church.</hi> How we may plainely vnderſtand
what are the ſignes of the true church, and
what alſo are the bodies of the church of
Antichriſt at Rome, euen murdering of the
ſaints of Chriſt, contempt of the word and
ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, worldly proſperitie, with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of ill men with ſworde to defend it.
Furthermore, this church, that it may be
the better knowen of vs, therfore hath it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
and ſundry names in the ſcriptures,
leſt we ſhould be deceiued by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> falſe church.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:139"/>
It is called y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſheepfold of Chriſt, doing vs
to vnderſtand, that thoſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> belong to Chriſt
are gentle as ſheepe, &amp; not cruel as wolues:<note place="margin">Eſaie 11.</note>
for they ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in al the
mountayne of my holines, (ſaith the Lorde
of hoſts) by his Prophet. This name of the
church excludeth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bloody church of Rome,
for they are as wolues &amp; cruell beaſtes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
the ſheepe, as well with vs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in Queene Maries dayes, howe
bloodthirſtie they were, in that the wolues
ſlewe ſo many of the ſheepe of Chriſt. It is
called the ſpouſe of Chriſt, therefore they
that giue them ſelues to another head and
huſband, as the falſe Romanes doe, are not
of this church. It is alſo compared and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
to the moone, becauſe the churche
taketh all her light and brightnes of Ieſus
Chriſt, the true ſunne of righteouſnes, as
the moone doeth take of the ſunne all her
light, which thing the Papiſtes doe not: for
they aſcribe not all to Chriſt, but ſome
things to the Pope, &amp; ſome to them ſelues
and others. And as the moone is not alway
viſible being in her change, ſo is not this
churche to the eye of man, alwayes in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſhe we, as the proude churche of Rome
is, but hath ſometime warre and aduerſitie,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:139"/>
ſometime peace &amp; proſperitie. It is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
like vnto a ſhip vpon the ſeas toſſed
in deede with the waues from one place to
an other, but yet neuer drowned, becauſe
Chriſt Ieſus is in it, and holdeth the ſterne
with his hande. Theſe thinges, vnto the
which the church is likened, doe very well
conuince Rome to be no church of God at
all, for it is alwayes viſible to the eie, and in
great wealth and proſperitie, as <hi>Babylon</hi>
was, &amp; ſo it boaſteth of her ſelfe, as ſhee did.
It neuer at all mourneth, or is in the pit of
afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Chriſt ſaid his church ſhouldbe,
<hi>Iohn.</hi> 16. And as we reade in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 9.
this church of Rome doth alwayes laugh
and reioyce, and neuer feeleth the rodde,
<hi>which is a token of baſtards, and ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates,
and not of Gods children Heb.</hi>
12. This <hi>true</hi> church of Chriſt is but one:
<hi>For there is but one mediator, &amp; one huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and therefore one ſpouſe, and one
body,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> proueth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>vniuerſall,</hi> becauſe it is in all partes of
the earth, and the <hi>Lord hath of his church
out of all nations and kinreds &amp; tongues,
Reuel.</hi> 7. Which church yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
is deuided into particular churches of
euery cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey &amp; kingdom, where as they al
<pb facs="tcp:10917:140"/>
make but one general church. For they are
ioyned together in the ſame ſpirite, fayth,
baptiſme, and Lorde Ieſus, which is one
head to them all. There was a particular
church in the houſe of <hi>Philemon,</hi> as Paul
reporteth in that epiſtle, and he alſo calleth
the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s a church, &amp; others too, vnto
whom he wrote, meaning that they were
ſpeciall churches of this vniuerſall church.
And here the ignorance of the Papiſtes is
ſeene and manifeſted, which make that to
be general and catholike, which is but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
&amp; ſpecial. For although their Rome
were a true church, yet can it not be termed
by any meanes, Catholike, except all the
ſaintes and good men aliue vpon the earth
were in it, which can not be. Here the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
are deceiued in the worde Catholike, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that to bee generall, which is but in
part ſo. Paul did neuer write to any church,
which hee called Catholike, for if hee had
meant ſo, that Rome had bene the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
church, when hee wrote vnto it, then
could he not properly haue called Corinth
a church at all. The ſumme of all that we
haue ſaid hitherto, is thus much: that there
is an holy church, whoſe head is Ieſus
Chriſt alone, to this end and purpoſe called
<pb facs="tcp:10917:140"/>
of God by his woord, that it ſhould gloryfie
him for his goodneſſe. For looke whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
our God doth, he doth it in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> behalfe of
his holy church: For this end doeth hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
ſometymes mightie kingdomes, and
great Princes, that hee might deliuer his
church, and verily, for this ende doeth hee
keepe and preſerue ſo long this wicked
worlde, vntill the number of his elect be
fulfilled. He neuer deſtroyed any nation,
but it was for his churches ſake. Oh howe
greatly are we then bound to the goodnes
of this our Chriſt, which worketh ſo great
thinges for vs! ſhall we not magnifie his
grace? ſhal we not yeelde him continuall
thanks, and that in the middeſt of the great
congregation? Beleeue me deare brethren,
we are elect, ereated, redeemed, iuſtified,
ſanctified, preſerued dayly by his power, &amp;
ſhalbe gloryfied in the life to come, with his
holy angels and ſaintes, that we ſhould ſet
forth his praiſe &amp; glory. And this is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thing,
which the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>S. Peter</hi> doth in
his firſt Epiſtle the ſecond Chapter, ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
exhort vs vnto, ſaying,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>To the church
of God, the trewe chriſtians of Pontus,
Aſia, Cappadocia, Galatia, and Bithynia,</hi>
(and in them to vs all:) <hi>you are</hi> (ſayth he)
<pb facs="tcp:10917:141"/>
                     <hi>a choſen generation, a roial prieſthood, an
holy nation, a people ſet at lybertie.</hi> Marke
nowe, dearely beloued, the chiefeſt poynt,
to what ende all theſe thinges are done
vnto vs, <hi>that yee ſhoulde</hi> (ſayth hee)
<hi>ſhewe foorth the vertues of him that
hath called you out of darkneſſe, vnto
his marueilous light.</hi> Doe wee nowe
ſhewe foorth his goodneſſe with thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing?
then are we good Chriſtians, and
ſerue to the ende, whereunto the Lord hath
made vs. Are wee not all carefull of this
duety, to praiſe God his name daily? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we haue then tranſgreſſed, and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the ende, of our creation
and calling. The praiſe of God is ſuch
a thing, ſo hye, and ſo excellent, that if
all the Angels in heauen, with their
force and might<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all the men in earth,
with all their ſpeach and eloquence, goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to ſet it forth and declare it, they ſhall
not do it ſufficienly, and as it deſerueth to
be done. We ought then to do what lieth
in vs: and this thing doth the triumphant
church in heauen, of Angels, and Saints,
teache vs, that we ſhould neuer ceaſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his name at al times, as they do, for they
<pb facs="tcp:10917:141"/>
cannot ſatiſfy themſelues with crying, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
holy, holy is the Lorde God of hoſtes,
the whole worlde is full of his glory, Eſay.</hi>
6. And in the Reuelation the fourth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the foure beaſtes, and the Elders
ceaſe not day nor night, crying, <hi>Holy,
holy, holy Lorde God almighty, which
was, which is, and which is to come.</hi>
And yet for all this, wee here in earth
can ſatiſfy our ſelues, and be contented
to ſet foorth his praiſe, either neuer a
whit, or els ſo negligently and by ſuch
ſtartes, as wee declare, wee haue no
great loue and care thereunto: ſo colde is
our zeale in this poynt, and yet moſt hot
in trifles and vanites, apperteining to
our pleaſures &amp; profits in this life. Wee
haue nowe heard (dearely beloued) the
meaning of this article, concerning the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Church,</hi> what it is, and who is
the head of it, what authoritye it hath,
by what ſignes it may bee alwayes
knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the <hi>Romiſh or falſe Church.</hi>
We haue alſo declared, that it is called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,</hi>
becauſe it is not tyed to any time,
<hi>perſons,</hi> or <hi>place</hi> whatſoeuer, but is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
euery where, as ſeemeth good to the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:142"/>
Lord. We haue furthermore ſhewed vnto
you, what be the markes of it, and what are
not the trewe ſignes of it, and that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
not in multitude of people, but in
weight of trueth. Laſt of al, we haue made
manifeſt, to what end y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord hath gathered
a church together vnto himſelfe here in
earth, which is, that hee may be honoured
and gloryfied in it, accordingly by their
good workes and chriſtian conuerſation.
Now let vs giue thankes to Ieſus Chriſt,
the head of this Church, in that hee hath
vouchſafed to make vs the holy members
of it, which were before the firebrandes of
hell, and a generation of Satans broode.
Let vs moreouer prayſe his name, for as
much as he doth daily preſerue vs by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
goodnes, and diuine prouidence, in
this ſheepefold of his, from all wolues and
rauening beaſtes, which otherwiſe would
deuoure vs. And becauſe he doth feede vs in
it with wholeſome &amp; greene paſtures of his
holye worde, and leadeth vs foorth to the
waters of life and comfort to refreſhe our
ſoules, let vs not be vnmindful or vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to him, for this ſo great a benefit. Now
let vs moſt humbly pray vnto him, that he
would vouchſafe to keepe vs in this church
<pb facs="tcp:10917:142"/>
of his vnto the ende, leſt we wander and go
aſtray from it as loſt ſheepe, and beſeech we
him, that he would continue his graces &amp;
heauenly promiſes made vnto vs ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in his Goſpel, that from day to day,
we may grow in holines toward him, as
beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth this church, vntil the time come,
that our full redemption from him ſhall
appeare. This God graunt vnto vs, not for

hath purchaſed al theſe things for vs, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the

we haue heard what wee haue
to beleeue concerning y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> church,
which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe of Chriſt: Now
followe the ornaments, and benefits which
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord in mercy doth, &amp; wil beſtowe vpon

ſo ineſtimable, that wee can not worthyly
conceiue of them, being couered with fleſh
and bloud: and therefore wee are the leſſe
thankeful, then otherwiſe we ſhould be, if
we did or could deepely conſider of them:
for they are ſuch iewels, as the Lord doeth

ſuch as abide in the church, and are true &amp;

proofe of this, in the ſecond epiſtle to the
Corinthians. <hi>Chap. 5. God was in Chriſt,
and reconciled the world vnto himſelfe,
not imputing their ſinnes vnto them.</hi> And
in the ſecond to the Coloſſians. <hi>Ye which
were dead in ſinnes, &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">c</hi> vncircumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of your fleſh, hath he quickened toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with him, freely forgiuing you all
your treſpaſſes.</hi> We ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this doctrine to
be warranted with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> teſtimonies of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ghoſt: So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we neede not to doubt any
thing at al of it. Seeing then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the houſe of the Lord, is by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
away of all our ſinnes, and becauſe
we haue nothing to do with God, except
our offences be blotted and wiped out of
his remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: Let vs a litle I pray you,
(dearely beloued brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſt) marke
what we haue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider in this article for
our inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto a godly life.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:144"/>
We ſay here, that we doe beleeue that there
is a remiſſion of ſinnes, for the children of
God and ſeruants of Chriſt. The firſt thing
therefore that we ought to learne and beare
in minde vpon this article, is, that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
and acknowledge moſt humbly and
meekely our ſinnes before God. For if we
ſay and graunt a remiſſion of ſinnes, wee
muſt alſo confeſſe that wee are ſinners, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
wee can not at all haue pardon of
them. Secondly we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider by whom
this remiſſion doeth come vnto vs, and for
whoſe ſake it is. Thirdly by what meanes
we are made capable and partakers of this
ſo great a benefite. As concerning the firſt
poynt, it is playne and euident that wee are
all of vs miſerable ſinners before GOD,
which looketh vpon the hearts of men, and
tryeth them: For who can iuſtly and truely
ſaye of him ſelfe, My heart is cleane, I am
no ſinner. Nay, Salomon doeth tell vs,
<hi>that there is not a man that ſinneth not,
1. Reg. 8. Eccle.</hi> 7. And Saint Iohn ſayeth
playnely, <hi>that if we ſay we haue no ſinne,
we doe but deceyue our owne ſelues, and
there is no trueth in vs.</hi> We are begotten,
conceyued, and borne in ſinne, we liue and
are brought vp in ſinne: and ſhall any man
<pb facs="tcp:10917:145"/>
be ſo impudent and ſhameleſſe, as to deny
that he is a ſinner? God forbid. The Apoſtle
ſayeth, <hi>All men haue ſinned and are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of the glorie of God, Rom.</hi> 3. But we
neede not to goe farre for the proofe of this
matter: Our Sauiour Chriſt hath taught
his to ſay dayly and hourely, euen as long
as they liue, <hi>Forgiue vs our ſinnes or treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,
Matth.</hi> 6. It is therefore a deuiliſh
pride and preſumption to ſay, whoſoeuer he
be, that he is no ſinner: for ſurely the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt
can not helpe him, for he came to ſaue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
And yet there are ſome in the world,
and haue bene alſo, that haue denied this:
So greatly that Satan bewitched them.
Well, if theſe teſtimonies of ſcripture did
not condemne them ſufficiently, yet I am
ſure, their owne heart &amp; conſciences ſome
time or other wil accuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and their own
mouth witnes againſt them. Iob telleth vs
this thing plainely in his booke Chap. 9. <hi>If
I would iuſtifie my ſelfe, my owne mouth
would condemne me.</hi> We ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we
are al of vs, euen the beſt, wretched ſinners:
Nowe as we are ſinners, ſo we muſt alſo
learne to confeſſe and acknowledge theſe
ſinnes, otherwiſe it is to no purpoſe, if a
man be a ſinner, and will not confeſſe it. If
<pb facs="tcp:10917:145"/>
a man be ſicke, and eyther doeth not, or will
not acknowledge it, hee can not lyghtly bee
healed of the Phyſitian: for he wil not ſeeke
vnto him. Except a man feele his wound, he
will not go to the Surgeon: and vnleſſe a
man be ignorant, and ſeeth the want of his
knowledge that he ought to haue, he wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
deſire to be further inſtructed, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe
ſtill in his ignorance and blindneſſe.
Who deſireth meate, that is not hungry? or
drinke, that is not thirſtie? or clothes, that
thinketh he hath apparel ynough? My mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is this, It is not ynough for a man to
thinke he is a ſinner, vnleſſe he hath an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and an effectual feeling of his ſinnes in
his conſcience, &amp; that they are as an heauy &amp;
grieuous burden vnto him. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he come
to Chriſt, he ſhall quickly haue remedy for
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>For he came not to cal the righteous,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
is, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that thought themſelues ryghteous,
&amp; boaſted of it, for in deed there is none righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
before him: <hi>but he came to cal poore
ſinners to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</hi> And this agreeth with
that notable ſaying of Paul, <hi>that Chriſt
Ieſus came into this world to ſaue ſinners,
wherof he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed himſelf to be chiefe, 1.
Tim.</hi> 1. There is a notable place co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning
this matter in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth of Luke, where our
<pb facs="tcp:10917:146"/>
Sauiour Chriſt, entring into the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
of Nazareth to reade and to preach
on the Sabboth day, found y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where it
was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 61. of Eſay, ſaying,
<hi>The Spirit of the Lord is vpon me, becauſe
he hath anointed me, that I ſhould preach
the Goſpel to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore: he hath ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t me, that
I ſhoulde heale the broken hearted, that I
ſhould preach deliuerance to the captiues,
and recouering of ſight to the blinde: that
I ſhoulde ſet at libertie them that are bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and that I ſhoulde preach the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
yeere of the Lord.</hi> This place doeth
ſhewe for whom Chriſt Ieſus is ſent and is
meete, that is, for the poore, the broken hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the captiues in ſinne, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blinde in minde,
the bruiſed in pryſon. If we feele our ſelues
to be ſuch men, Chriſt is ſent vnto vs: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
hee is not for vs. And this is the
cauſe that made our Sauiour to keepe
companie moſt commonly with Publicans
and ſinners, and ſuch as were infected with
great ſinnes &amp; offences, as Marie Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene,
and Matthew, and Zaccheus: for theſe
did willingly confeſſe their ſinnes vnto
him, and ſo he cured them. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ſide hee refuſed the company of the
Scribes and Phariſes, the hie Prieſtes and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:146"/>
Doctors of the lawe, becauſe, although they
were ſinners, yea, and grieuous ſinners
too, yet they had an opinion of holines and
righteouſneſſe in them ſelues, aboue other
men, and iuſtified them ſelues before our
Sauiour Chriſt, as we ſee in the parable of
<hi>the Publicane and Phariſe that went vp
both of them to praye into the Temple,
Luk.</hi> 18. Theſe Phariſes our ſauiour ſaide,
they had no neede of the Phyſician, becauſe
they dyd not acknowledge their infirmitie
and weakeneſſe vnto him. <hi>Chriſt in deede
is meate, but for the hungry, Iohn</hi> 6. he is
water and drinke, <hi>but for the thirſtie, Eſay</hi>
55. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. he is a refreſhing, but <hi>for them
that are loden and burdened, Matth.</hi> 11.
Doe wee giue almes at any time to a ſtout
begger, that although he haue neede, yet
wil not confeſſe it, and aſke his almes gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
acknowledging his pouertie? No
more ſurely will the Lorde giue vnto any
ſpirituall almes, vnleſſe wee ſhall humble
our ſelues before him, with true feeling of
our pouertie and miſerie. For verely here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we muſt all of vs bee lyke vnto beggers,
that, to mooue pitie and compaſſion, ſhewe
not the beſt thinges they haue, (if they haue
any) but the worſt, as their ragges, their
<pb facs="tcp:10917:147"/>
ſores, their pouertie and nakedneſſe: And
this moueth men the ſooner to pitie them.
Dearely beloued in Chriſt, the caſe ſtandeth
ſo, and no otherwiſe, betweene the Lorde
and vs. If we will get any thing, it is by
falling downe, and humbling our ſelues,
and not by vaunting of any thing that is in
vs: for he reſiſteth the proude, and giueth
grace to the humble and lowly. Do we not
ſee it ſo by experience? Is not the beſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
and meddowe grounde in the loweſt
places and valleyes, and the moſt barren
grounde in the hygheſt hilles and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines?
So the graces of the Lorde reſt in
the lowe ſtomacke and heart, and flee from
the hye and loftie minde. Let therefore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hill and mountayne be layde lowe, Luke
3. A notable example of this meeke and
humble confeſſion of our ſinnes, we haue
in the Prophete Dauid, who, although he
were a King, yet when he was reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and reprooued ſharpely of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
Nathan for his adulterie and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
ſayd, without any replying or chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Prophete, moſt mildely, <hi>I
haue ſinned vnto the Lorde.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he heard incontinently that ſweete an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
from the Lorde, <hi>The Lorde alſo
<pb facs="tcp:10917:147"/>
hath put awaye thy ſinne, thou ſhalt not
die,</hi> 2. of Kinges 12. Chapter. This thing
Dauid reporteth of himſelf in the Pſalme
32. <hi>Then I acknowledged my ſinne vnto
the Lorde, neyther hid I mine iniquitie:
For I thought, I will confeſſe agaynſt my
ſelfe, my wickedneſſe vnto the Lorde, and
thou forgaueſt the puniſhment of my
ſinne.</hi> Looke in the Pſalme 51. where hee
deſcribeth the ſame more at large. This
leſſon is to be learned of vs all, that when
we commit ſinne, we ſhoulde not cloke our
ſinne as the hypocrites doe. Looke vpon
the poore Publicane, and vpon Peter: the
one confeſſed them humbly, the other wept
for them moſt bitterly. And ſurely ſo dyd
all the good men doe from time to time.
Howe often doe the Prophetes Eſay and
Daniel confeſſe their ſinnes, and the ſinnes
of the people! Did not Tobiah do the like?
and Paul him ſelfe doeth in many places
confeſſe with griefe of minde, that he was a
perſecuter of the Church of Chriſt, 1. Cor.
15. yea, that he had the relikes of ſinne ſtill
abiding in him, Rom. 7. Yea this confeſſion
&amp; acknowledging of our faults, muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
be made to our neyghbour or brother,
if we haue offended him, and we muſt, &amp; are
<pb facs="tcp:10917:148"/>
commaunded to ſeeke reconciliation at his
handes, as our Sauiour ſayeth, Matth. 5.
<hi>If thou bring thy gift to the altar, &amp; there
reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>breſt that thy brother hath ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thee, leaue there thine offring before
the altar, and goe thy way, firſt be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to thy brother, and then come and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
thy gift.</hi> And this is that thing that S.
Iames meant in his Epiſtle 5. Chap. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
your faultes one to another,
and pray one for another, that ye may be
healed:</hi> not ſo, that wee allowe any papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ſhrift, or a vaine confeſſion of all our
ſinnes in the eare of a maſmonging Prieſt,
which can do vs no good, but rather taketh
an occaſion him ſelfe to bee ill, when he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the lewde deedes of ſome. But wee
meane, that an agreement is to bee ſought
for, with ſubmiſſion one to another, if any
man be offended. Neyther doeth this place
of Iames prooue the Popiſh confeſſion, as
they woulde haue it: for hee ſpeaketh not
here of the Prieſt, but of all Chriſtians.
And if ſo bee they will haue this place to
prooue it, then muſt their Prieſt confeſſe
as well his ſinnes to the people, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to him: for ſo goe the wordes of the
text, One to another acknowledge your
<pb facs="tcp:10917:148"/>
faultes. Notwithſtanding if any man feele
him ſelfe grieued with his ſinne, and clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in his minde and conſcience, if then hee
reſort to his godlie and learned Paſtor or
preacher in the pariſhe, and tell it vnto him,
to haue comfort and his aduiſe what to doe,
hee can not iuſtly for this bee reprehended of
any, becauſe it is both good and godly. But
to number vp al their ſinnes to the miniſter,
as the papiſtes woulde haue it, no man can
doe: <hi>for who knoweth howe oft hee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth?</hi>
as Dauid ſayth, Pſalme 19. ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is this thing warranted by any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
or example in ſcripture. But to our
purpoſe: wee ſee then by theſe thinges, that
as we are ſinners all the ſort of vs, ſo wee
muſt not diſſemble them, if wee truely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende
to haue remiſſion of them, but with
our whole heart we ought to confeſſe them
vnto the Lorde. And here is to bee noted,
that in this article wee doe beleeue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
a remiſſion or forgiueneſſe of ſinnes,
and not a ſatiſfaction of vs for our ſinnes,
as the aduerſaries teach, that wee muſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
for our ſinnes, and purchaſe pardons
from Rome by money, by maſſes, and ſuch
trumperies, as going on pilgrimage bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote,
by faſtings, and lying in hearecloth.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:149"/>
Surely if theſe things bee added to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
our ſinnes, then is not this our article
true, which ſayth, that there is a free remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſinnes without paying any thing at
all of our part, euen as the detter when hee
hath nothing to pay or diſcharge his dette,
ſome godly creditour doeth freely, forgiue
him. Nowe if hee ſhoulde pay any thing, or
halfe of it, then it is not freely forgiuen, but
partly forgiuen, and partly payde: but Iohn
pronounceth, <hi>that if any man thirſt, he may
come and take of the well of the water of
life freely,</hi> Reuelation 20. 22. Eſay 55.
If wee may take away any of our ſinnes
by ſatiſfying for them, then all is not due
to the blood of Ieſus Chriſt: but Iohn
ſayth, <hi>that it is the blood of Chriſte</hi> and
no other thing <hi>that doeth purge vs from
all our ſinne.</hi> Wee with all our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
and good deedes can not ſatiſfie Gods
wrath and anger, conceiued for one of the
leaſt of our offences: for the leaſt ſinne that
we committe, deſerueth euerlaſting hell
fire: and howe then can wee ſatiſfie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
wee bee freely forgiuen? This Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
well vnderſtoode, ſaying, <hi>If thou, O
Lord, ſtraitly markeſt iniquities, O Lorde,
who may ſtande?</hi> but marke what Dauid
<pb facs="tcp:10917:149"/>
addeth, and it confirmeth our poſition and
purpoſe: <hi>but mercie</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>is with thee,
that thou maieſt be feared,</hi> Pſal. 130. Hee
declareth vnto vs ſufficiently, that wee can
not bee iuſtified before the moſt pure God,
but by forgiueneſſe of ſinnes: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pronounced that man bleſſed that had
his ſinnes forgiuen, not that had ſatiſfied for
them. Our ſauiour doeth teach his to pray
in humilitie, <hi>Forgiue vs our ſinnes,</hi> and not
to ſay, Giue vs grace or might to ſatiſfie for
them. Thus much for the firſt poynt, that
if wee will haue pardon of our ſinnes, wee
muſt firſt confeſſe and acknowledge them:
for what ſhould God forgiue vs, if we were
not ſinners? The ſeconde thing to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in this article, is to knowe to whome to
come vnto for the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes,
and for whoſe ſake they are remitted, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to knowe and beleeue a remiſſion of
ſinnes, is in vaine: for as it is booteleſſe for
a man that is very hungrie, to knowe and
beleeue there is meate in the worlde, except
he knew the place &amp; the man that had it for
him, that he might reſort vnto him: and as
it is in vayne to confeſſe thy diſeaſe and
ſickenſſe, vnles thou know ſome good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicion
who may helpe thee: ſo ſurely it ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:10917:150"/>
profite vs nothing at all to knowe or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
our ſinnes, if wee bee ignorant of the
mediatour that ſhould take them away: yea,
if the ſicke perſon ſhoulde ſeeke out ſuch a
Phyſition, as either could not or would not
cure him, his labour alſo were vnprofitable,
and all one, as if the needy man ſhoulde goe
to one for an almes, that is as needy as hee
him ſelf. Let vs therefore take diligent heede
to this, that being ſicke of our ſinnes in our
ſoules, we goe and runne to ſuch a cunning
Phyſition, as we are ſure both can and will
for his abilitie and compaſſion cure and
heale our infirmities, and hath a ſalue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
ſore and maladie. This cure and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke
for all diſeaſes, reſteth not in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
whatſoeuer, no not in the Angels: for
they neede a mediatour to holde them al vp,
not in the Saintes: for eyther they are all
ſinners, as thoſe aliue here in the earth, or
els haue bene all ſinners, as they in heauen,
and therefore neede a mediatour as well as
wee. There is no creature therefore in this
great cure of ſinnes, that can doe vs any
good: nay rather wee ſhall be woorſe and
woorſe, runnyng to them, as the woman in
the Goſpell was with the iſſue of blood, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vnto Phiſitions, vntill ſhee came to
<pb facs="tcp:10917:150"/>
Chriſt, who cured her immediatly, Luke 8.
for he is only the good Phyſition, that came
to cure our deadly woundes, Matthewe
9. Will yee then knowe who this is that
onely forgiueth ſinnes? Marke what the
holy Ghoſt ſaith, Ioh. 1. <hi>Behold the lambe
of God that taketh away the ſinnes of the
worlde.</hi> Who is this onely lambe of God,
but Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of GOD, ſlaine
from the beginning of the worlde for the
ſinnes of the people? <hi>for there is but one
mediatour betweene God &amp; man, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man
Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Timo. 2. <hi>and he hath giuen
him ſelfe a ranſome for all.</hi> If this bee ſo,
we may boldely come vnto him at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
eſpecially when hee calleth,
<hi>Come vnto mee all yee that doe labour
and are laden, and I will refreſh you,</hi> Matt.
11. The whole ſcriptures both of the newe
and olde teſtament doe propounde no other
redeemer vnto vs, then Ieſus Chriſt. All
the ſacrifices were figures of remiſſion of
ſinnes by Chriſt alone: for it was vnpoſſible
(as the Apoſtle ſaith,) that the blood of
goates and calues ſhoulde take away ſinne:
but yet ſinnes were taken away vnder the
lawe. It remayneth therefore, that they
ſhoulde bee taken away by Chriſt: for Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<pb facs="tcp:10917:151"/>
reioyced to ſee his day, and ſawe it
gladly, Iohn 8. There was but one temple,
but one hie prieſt, but one altar: ſo there is but
one Chriſt to men, to take away ſinnes: for
all theſe thinges were ſhadowes of him.
He is the true temple, in whome wee muſt
pray, the hie prieſt that offereth his body for
vs, and the true altar, vpon whom we muſt
offer all our ſacrifices of prayer and
thankeſgiuing, if wee will haue them to
pleaſe God, and to be accepted of him. Wee
haue (ſaith the holy ghoſt) an altar (meaning
Chriſt:) whereof they haue no authoritie
to eate, which ſerue in the tabernacle, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the vnbeleeuing Iewes. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by him offer the ſacrifice of praiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to God, that is, <hi>the fruite of the lips,
which confeſſe his name,</hi> Hebrews. 13.
Our ſauiour Chriſt, when he ſent forth his
apoſtles to preach, willed not them to preach
remiſſion of ſinnes, but <hi>in his name onely,</hi>
Luke 24. and this doeth Peter in the Actes
declare vnto vs chapter 10. <hi>Through his
name euery one y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doth beleue, ſhal receiue
remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Healings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body were
done &amp; wrought in his name by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Apoſtles,
Actes 5. and therefore the clenſing and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:10917:151"/>
of the ſoule, which is by remiſſion
of our ſinnes, is much more to be looked for
at his hands. And as it was in Egypt, in the
great dearth and famine of corne, none could
haue any food of <hi>Pharao</hi> the king, but by the
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of Ioſeph, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had made ouerſeer &amp;
ruler of the land in his name (for when they
cryed to him for breade, he ſayde, <hi>Goe yee
to Ioſeph, and what he ſayth to you, do ye,</hi>
Geneſis 41.) ſo it is nowe in the famine and
dearth of our ſoules for ſpirituall foode, we
can haue nothing to feed our hungry ſoules
from the king of heauen, but by the meanes
of the true Ioſeph, which is Ieſus Chriſt,
who is ordeined of his father to rule and
gouerne all thinges in his name, ſo that
hee ſendeth vs to his Sonne, when wee
aſke any thing of him, for in him hee is wel
pleaſed, and for his ſake onely and for no
mans elſe, doeth hee beſtowe this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
vpon vs: for GOD hath in
deede giuen lyfe vnto the worlde, but
this lyfe is in his Sonne, that all ſhould
honour the Sonne, as they honour
the Father. And as among the Iſraelites
none coulde bee healed that were
ſtung of the fyerye Serpentes, but all
<pb facs="tcp:10917:152"/>
ſuch as looked vp to the braſen Serpent
which Moſes made: ſo it is as certaine, that
none can bee deliuered from the ſtinging of
the olde ſerpent which is the deuill, but they
that looke vp to the ſonne of God on hie in
heauen, they haue redemption by his blood,
that is, the remiſſion of ſinnes, Epheſians 1.
<hi>There is no other name vnder heauen,
wherein we muſt be ſaued,</hi> no other fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
whereupon wee muſt builde vp into
heauen, no other ſtone that coupleth the
building together, no other key that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gates vnto vs, but Ieſus Chriſt,
Reuelation. 5. <hi>Except therefore we beleeue
that it is he that taketh away all our ſinnes,
wee ſhall die in them,</hi> Iohn. 8. Neither is
this doctrine onely confirmed vnto vs by
the authorities of the worde, but alſo by the
examples of all the godly. Dauid was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
in the way of the Lord, but to whom
doth he goe for knowledge? <hi>Teach me, O
Lorde,</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>the way of thy ſtatutes,</hi>
Pſalme 119. Neither ſhall ye reade, that he
went at any time to any other, in that his
whole booke of prayers &amp; thankeſgiuings,
ſaue onely to the Lorde: he did knowe well
ynough, that all other ſcholemaſters were
vnlearned and domme, and as Idoles that
<pb facs="tcp:10917:152"/>
could not ſpeake. The woman of Canaan
went at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt to Chriſt, to haue her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cured. Saint Paul praied <hi>to the Lorde,
to haue the meſſenger of Satan to depart
from him, 2. Cor.</hi> 12. Neither can there be
any example brought of any, that euer he
went to any other then to the Lord onely, to
haue his ſinnes and offences taken awaye.
By this, that our ſinnes are forgiuen in
Chriſt alone, we learne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we of our ſelues
by nature are hatefull vnto God, before we
bee reconciled vnto him by the death of his
Sonne: ſo that except he behold and looke
vpon our ſinnes in the face and countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of Ieſu Chriſt, wee are but caſtawayes.
Wherefore (brethren) let vs looke vnto it,
that wee may perſwade, not men, but our
owne ſelues, not in tongue and mouth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but in heart and deede, that we are ſurely
members of Chriſt. Furthermore we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by this, that the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> the <hi>Turke,</hi> the
<hi>Iewe,</hi> haue all gone aſtray, for they ſeeke for
remiſſion of ſinnes by other meanes, then
by the death of Chriſt. The <hi>Papiſt</hi> by his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfactorie
woorkes of his owne deuice, by
pardons from the Pope, when as no man
can forgiue ſinnes, but God onely: by his
praying to Angels, to Saints, whome he
<pb facs="tcp:10917:153"/>
maketh interceſſors and mediators to God,
and ſo leaueth the waters of life Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
and diggeth ſuch broken pittes and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternes,
as can holde no water at all. I ſee
not therefore howe hee can haue remiſſion
of his ſinnes, ſeeing he ſeeketh it els where
then in the blood of Chriſt, and of Chriſt
alone, for they giue ſomething vnto him,
but not all, and ſo they make him but halfe
a ſauiour. But eyther hee will bee a whole
Sauiour vnto them, that hee may haue
all the glorie and prayſe, or elſe he will be
none at all. Chriſt can not abide any thing
to be ioyned with him, in the way to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and euerlaſting life, but he will bee
the onely and whole Sauiour to men.
The <hi>Turke</hi> that hateth this name of Chriſt,
and goeth not about to haue remiſſion of
ſinnes by it, can clayme no part in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of the kingdome of heauen: hee
thinketh to bee ſaued by God the Father,
when hee honoureth not God the Sonne.
Agayne, he truſteth to his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and
his falſe prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and forſaketh
the true and euerlaſting Prophete Ieſus
Chriſt, whome God ſent into the worlde,
to giue life vnto it. They can ſaye, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in God the Father Almightie,</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:10917:153"/>
they will not confeſſe that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of Ieſus Chriſt the onely Sonne of
God, and therefore they are not vnder the
Couenaunt of grace and ſaluation, but
ſtande all accurſed before the lyuing Lorde,
as beyng without Chriſt. Thirdly, the
Iewes can haue or looke for no remiſſion
of ſinnes, becauſe they haue reiected this
Chriſt, and go about to eſtabliſh their owne
righteouſneſſe by the workes of the Lawe,
whereas Chriſt is the full ende or perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lawe, <hi>for righteouſneſſe to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one that beleeueth, Rom.</hi> 10. They
haue a zeale, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and thinking to bee ſaued by the
Lawe, they all ſtande accurſed, and alſo
accurſed iuſtly by the Law before the Lord,
<hi>For curſed</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>is he that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not in all thinges that are written in
this booke to doe them, Galat.</hi> 3. They
are detters then (without Chriſt) to keepe
and perfourme the whole Lawe perfitly
and abſolutely vnto the Lorde, which no
man can doe, no not they, and therefore
(without a Sauiour) they ſtande in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
caſe, euen in the ſtate of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
damnation and perdition. And laſt of
all, the falſe and Hypocriticall Chriſtian,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:154"/>
which profeſſeth with his mouth, that hee
knoweth and beleeueth in Chriſt, and yet
vtterly denyeth him in his whole life &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation,
can hope for no remiſſion of his
ſinnes, continuing ſtill as he doeth in diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and all kinde of abominations.
But the Lord hath dyed for ſinners you wil
ſaye, and great and notorious sinners too:
trueth it is, he hath done ſo, but yet they are
ſuch ſinners as repent and are ſory for their
former ſinnes, they lead not their life in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie
ſinnes, ſo that they ſhoulde delite &amp;
dwel in ſinne: but they continue in the feare
of the Lord. Briefely, they are penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and not obſtinate and wilfull perſons,
that can not repent, for whom the Lord hath
died. If we feele our ſelues to be ſuch trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
ſinners, the Lorde hath a free remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſinnes for vs, whenſoeuer we come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: for to <hi>whom doth the Lord looke?
Euen to him that is poore, &amp; of a contrite
ſpirit, and trembling at his wordes.</hi> But he
that hardeneth his heart, and goeth on ſtill
in his former wickedneſſe, without remorſe
of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience at al, he heapeth vp wrath vnto
himſelfe againſt the daye of wrath, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his ſinnes ſo heauie vnto himſelfe, that
they will preſſe him downe to hell. Theſe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:154"/>
men muſt amend their ill liues, and be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
ſory for their ſinnes, not in hypocriſie,
as <hi>Pharao</hi> was, who ſaid, I haue ſinned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lorde: neither in deſperation, as Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,
who repented, but not in faith. But
herein let them followe Dauid in the olde
Teſtament, and Peter in the Newe, who
repented, and wept moſt bitterly, but yet in
hope, &amp; had remiſſion of their ſinnes. Theſe
men by their repentance, afterwarde chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and altered their olde liues and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
their olde man with his maners was
put off, and the newe man, which after God
was created in righteouſneſſe and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
was foorthwith put on, and ſo they
walked all their dayes afterward in a newe
life. Many men can ſay now a daies: Oh, I
nowe repent, I am ſory for my ſinnes, &amp; yet
by and by, or the next daye, they fall to the
ſame or like ſinnes againe. Shal we thinke
ſuch men repent? nay verely, they deceyue
but themſelues and the worlde, for God
they can not deceiue. Repentance is in the
heart, and not in the mouth, for it is a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and chaunging of the minde from ill
to good. As long therefore as we ſee their
liues not to bee at all chaunged, wee may
boldely ſaye, they repent not truely, and
<pb facs="tcp:10917:155"/>
therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remiſſion of ſinnes is excluded
from them. Hee that repenteth truely,
altereth his wicked life, as wee ſee it came
to paſſe in Paul, who, after that hee was
called, and repented of his former life,
neuer returned agayne to perſecute the
Church of Chriſt, neyther did hee liue
as before hee did. Well, to conclude
this part, if this remiſſion of ſinnes come
vnto vs by Chriſt, let vs be ſure to bee in
his loue, let vs not profane his holy name
by our vile blaſphemies in our mouthes
dayly, as the wicked doe: but <hi>let euery
one that calleth vpon this name, depart
from all iniquitie, 2. Timothie 2. chapter.</hi>
The thirde thing to bee conſidered in this
remiſſion of our ſinnes, was as I ſayde
before, the <hi>meanes</hi> by the which it may
bee applyed vnto vs, and receyued from
Ieſus Chriſt the authour of it. For vnleſſe
wee alſo knowe this, it is to no purpoſe
to knowe the former two poyntes. And
this may bee made playne vnto vs by this
ſimilitude. The poore man that is an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred,
although hee knowe whyther to goe
to ſome riche man or other for his meate
and almes, yet except he vnderſtand, what
meanes and waye to vſe to obtayne this
<pb facs="tcp:10917:155"/>
reliefe of the riche man, all is in vayne:
for if he ſhould vſe ſtoute and ſturdy words,
when hee ought to be gentle, or if he ſhould
commaunde it, when hee ſhoulde intreate
for it, hee were not like to ſpeede, or if
the riche man did offer him meate to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
with the hande, and hee put foorth
his foule feete to receyue it, it were a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
prepoſterous order, and ſuch a thing
as myght iuſtly cauſe this man to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
his liberalitie from him: ſo ſurely
the caſe ſtandeth betweene our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, the Prince of all heauenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and vs poore ſinners and wretches.
Albeit we well perceyue, that hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſinnes for vs, yet wee muſt
knowe the waye to pleaſe him, when wee
come to haue our ſute obtayned. And this
waye to pleaſe him, and to take the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
that hee offereth, is onely faith in his
name. <hi>For without faith it is vnpoſſible
to pleaſe him. For he that commeth vnto
him, muſt beleeue that he is, and that
hee is a rewarder of all them that ſeeke
him,</hi> as ſayth the holy Ghoſt the eleuenth to
the Hebrewes. When therefore the Lorde
Ieſus offereth this great benefite of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
vnto vs, in the free remiſſion
<pb facs="tcp:10917:156"/>
of all our ſinnes, wee muſt not offer out
to him our foule feete, that is to ſaye, our
woorkes, which are with many ſinnes pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
and defiled: for ſo wee myght cauſe
him to bee angrie with vs, and to keepe
backe his gracious benefites. But we muſt
as he hath commaunded, and alwaies in the
Goſpell requireth, when he is about to doe
vs any good, beleeue onely in him, that is,
offer vnto him our hande, that is, true faith,
which is a fitte thing and inſtrument to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
his bleſſinges. Neyther is this our
ſaying, but the phraſe and maner of ſpeache
in the Scriptures. Our Sauiour Chriſt
did neuer any miracle or cure vpon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of men, but hee required faith of them,
and they being healed, hee alwayes attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
it to the faith and confidence that they
had in him, and not to any good worke of
theirs. In the ninth chapter of the Goſpel
after Saint Matthews, wee reade there, of
a very charitable deede of foure men, that
brought one being ſicke of the palſie to our
ſauiour Chriſt, as hee laye on his bed: but
what ſayde our ſauiour Chriſt concerning
this? <hi>Ieſus ſeeing their faith, ſayde to the
ſicke of the palſie, Sonne, be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee.</hi> You ſee
<pb facs="tcp:10917:156"/>
howe that the cure of the man is aſcribed
to their faith, and not to their good workes.
Likewiſe two blinde men came vnto him
to be healed, crying, and ſaying, <hi>O ſonne of
Dauid, haue mercie vpon vs.</hi> This verily
was a good confeſſion, and worke of them,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 9. But what ſayeth hee vnto them?
<hi>Beleeue ye that I am able to doe this? they
ſayde, Yes. Then ſayeth he, According to
your faith be it vnto you.</hi> The woman that
was deliuered from the bloodie yſſue, heard
this of him: <hi>Daughter, be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
thy faith hath made thee whole, Matt.</hi>
9. When he rayſed vp the rulers daughter,
he required but onely faith of him, which
thing the Papiſtes ſaye, we can not prooue
out of the Scripture. In the eight of Luke
therefore this worde onely is put, to exclude
all other things: for (ſaith he) <hi>Beleeue only,
&amp; ſhe ſhalbe ſaued.</hi> Now if Chriſt require
this faith in the cure of the externall man,
that is, of the bodie, which is the leſſe thing,
hee doeth much more require it in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the inner man, the ſoule, which is
the greater cure, and of more valewe. You
haue then heard, that faith in Chriſt cureth
the body: heare nowe alſo, that Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
faith eſpecially to beleeue in him to
<pb facs="tcp:10917:157"/>
euerlaſting life. The Goſpell written by
Saint Iohn is full of this matter almoſt
in euery Chapter. Speaking of Chriſt, he
ſayeth on this wiſe, <hi>He came among his
owne, and his owne receyued him not,
but as many as receyued him, to them he
gaue prerogatiue to be the ſonnes of God,
euen to them that beleeue in his name,
Iohn</hi> 1. Againe, <hi>So God loued the world,
that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne,
that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhould
not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life, Ioh. 3.
He that beleeueth in him, is not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but he that beleeueth not, is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
already, becauſe he hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
in the name of the onely begotten
Sonne of God.</hi> In the fift of Iohn, our
ſauiour ſaith, <hi>Verely, verely I ſay vnto you,
he that heareth my worde, and beleeueth
him that ſent me, hath euerlaſting life, and
ſhall not come into condemnation, but
hath paſſed from death to life.</hi> The ſixte
chapter is full of ſuch godly and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſayings: <hi>I am that bread of life, he that
commeth vnto me, ſhal neuer hunger, and
he that beleeueth in me, ſhall neuer thirſt.
Verely, verely I ſay vnto you, he that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
in me, hath euerlaſting life. Theſe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:157"/>
things are written, that ye might beleeue
that Ieſus is Chriſt the Sonne of God, &amp; in
beleeuing ye might haue life through his
name, Ioh.</hi> 20. It were infinite to recite all
the places in Scripture that make for this
matter, and I ſhould be tedious, if I would
rehearſe them all. Notable is that place in
the ſixtenth chapter of the Actes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
where the Iayler demandeth of Paul
and Silas, <hi>what he ſhould doe to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
&amp; they anſwered forthwith, Beleeue
in the Lord Ieſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaued,
and all thine houſe.</hi> I referre them that liſt
to ſee moe places, to the <hi>Actes 3, 10, &amp;</hi> 13.
chapt. <hi>Rom. 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11. chapters. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi>
2. Out of theſe wordes wee gather
this doctrine for vs, that all the graces
and benefites of Chriſt are made ours by
faith in his blood, and by faith onely wee
take holde and laye hande vpon them, for
faith is as it were an hand, or a mouth open,
to receiue meate into the ſoule, and to feede
it. We muſt then open our hande, and our
mouth to receyue him: as Dauid ſayeth in
his Pſalmes, ſpeaking in the perſon of
God: <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which haue
brought thee out of the land of Egypt, ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thy mouth wide, and I will fill it, Pſal.</hi> 81.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:158"/>
In that place the Lorde accuſeth the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie
of the Iſraelites, that did not open
their mouthes in faith, to receiue his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
in ſuch obedience, as he powreth them
out. Againe, if faith bee the meane to bee
made partaker of Ieſus Chriſt, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
him to vs, to heale our diſeaſes: then on
the other ſide, incredulitie of man is the
ſtoppe or hinderance that letteth the Lord,
to powre down his bleſſings vpon vs. This
lacke of faith doeth ſhut vp his beneuolence
and good will from vs, ſo that hee can not
open heauen gates vnto vs, and powre vs
downe his bleſſing. Of this the Prophets
complayned in the olde time, both Eſai and
Ieremie: <hi>Behold</hi> (ſayeth Eſai) <hi>the Lords
hand is not ſhortened, that it can not ſaue,
neyther is his eare heauie, that it can not
heare, but your iniquities haue made a
ſeparation betweene you and your God,
and your ſinnes haue hid his face from
you, that he will not heare, Eſa. chap.</hi> 59.
So Ieremie in his fift Chapter: <hi>Your
ſinnes haue hindered good thinges from
you.</hi> And what ſinne or iniquitie can bee
greater, or more deteſtable before the Lord,
then the ſinne of incredulitie and vnbeliefe,
euen the mother and fountaine of all other
<pb facs="tcp:10917:158"/>
ſinnes? This is that which the Euangeliſt
Saint Matthewe reprehendeth in the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarites,</hi>
euen their incredulitie: for when
our Sauiour Chriſt came among them to
preach, and teache, and to heale them that
were ſicke, as hee did in other places, they
were offended with him, and gaue him iuſt
occaſion to ſaye of them, <hi>That a Prophete
was not without honour, ſaue in his owne
countrey, and in his owne houſe.</hi> Then is
it added in the ende of the Chapter, <hi>He did
not many great workes there, for their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefes
ſake, Matth.</hi> 13. So likewiſe our
Sauiour Chriſt ſayeth to the father of the
childe that was lunatike, conſidering his
want of faith: <hi>If thou couldeſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
all thinges were poſſible to him that
beleeueth, Marke</hi> 9. And this is the onely
cauſe that barred the Iſraelites out of the
land of Canaan: <hi>For we ſee that they could
not enter in, becauſe of vnbeliefe, Hebr.</hi> 3.
No more ſhall any enter at all into heauen,
which was figured by the holy lande of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
which beleeue not: for Iohn ſayeth,
<hi>that all the vnbeleuing ſhal haue their part
in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hich is the ſecond death, Reue.</hi> 21.
Nowe when wee ſaye, that faith alone in
<pb facs="tcp:10917:159"/>
Chriſt doeth applie all his good workes
vnto vs, wee doe not ſpeake againſt good
workes, that are done of the godly here in
this life, but our meaning is, that our good
deedes doe not ſaue vs, which any man that
hath read the Scriptures indifferently, wil
graunt. Wee exclude not workes in life
and maners here before men, but wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any part or portion of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
before the almightie God, in whoſe
preſence nothing is perfite, cleane or pure,
no not the ſunne, nor the moone, nor the
Angels: but onely the works of that imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
and vnſpotted Lambe, euen the man
Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe woorkes are all made
ours, and imputed vnto vs, as if wee had
done them, if wee doe but beleeue in him.
Good workes muſt bee done of vs, for theſe
three cauſes: firſt, becauſe God hath <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>
them, ſecondly, becauſe he is <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
by them,</hi> as our Sauiour ſayeth
Matthewe the fift, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine
before men, that they may ſee your good
workes, and glorifie your Father which
is in heauen.</hi> Thirdly, they muſt be done,
becauſe they <hi>profite</hi> and further our poore
neyghbours and brethren, the needy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Ieſus Chriſt, and in helping
<pb facs="tcp:10917:159"/>
them, wee helpe Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 25. For ſo doeth hee account it
as done to himſelfe. You may adde to theſe
a fourth cauſe, why good workes are to
bee done, although they ſaue vs not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſhall bee ſignes and tokens to
men of our faith, which is hid and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
vs, and ſhall declare that we are good
Chriſtians, euen as the tree is knowen
by his fruite: for if wee haue no good
workes, ſurely wee haue no good faith,
but a deuils faith, as Iames ſayeth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
wee bragge neuer ſo much of our
faith. This faith doeth not ſaue, but is a
dead faith, without any workes. The true
faith that wee ſpake of before, it doeth not
ſaue vs, in reſpect of the worthineſſe or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of it, but becauſe it doeth looke vnto
Chriſt his marke or obiect, and doeth appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende
him with his workes. The Papiſtes
ſaye, that faith alone can not iuſtifie vs,
becauſe it is vnperfect, as wee ſay workes
are, which therefore can not ſaue vs. But
we muſt vnderſtand that the reaſon is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like:
for we may haue a true &amp; a liuely faith
in Chriſt, although it be not in euery poynt
perfit &amp; abſolute. No man can haue a perfit
<pb facs="tcp:10917:160"/>
faith in this life, for it doeth ſtil increaſe, and
growe in greater meaſure: but the children
of God, they haue and may haue a true faith
cleanſed from hypocriſie and diſſimulation.
And this true faith doeth iuſtifie euery one
that looketh vp to Chriſt, as well as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
faith. Faith is likened to an hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a man doeth receiue any thing. Now we
knowe by experience, that one with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfit
hande, that either lacketh a finger, or
a thumbe, or that hath his hand ſore, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
blemiſhed, may as well with his lame
hand receiue a good and fine piece of golde
from a riche man, for his almes, as one that
hath a whole or ſounde hande: ſo may wee
receyue from Chriſt, if wee beleeue but a
litle, as much as a grayne of muſtard ſeede
in quantitie, wee may receyue remiſſion of
ſinnes, and all other benefites of his death
and paſſion, as well as he that hath a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
faith and a greater. And nothing ſhall
be vnpoſſible vnto vs, as Chriſt ſayde to
his diſciples in the like matter, Matth. 17.
Nowe <hi>faith is</hi> ſayde to bee <hi>a firme and
a conſtant aſſent of the minde to the
wordes of God, wrought by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the holy ghoſt for the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the beleeuers.</hi> Seeyng then ſo
<pb facs="tcp:10917:160"/>
many excellent thinges are giuen vnto
vs, if wee abide faithfull, and beleeue in
the Lorde: and ſeeing furthermore on the
contrary part, wee are depriued of all theſe
promiſes and giftes, if we haue no faith: it
behoueth vs to looke about, and to examine
well our ſelues, our hearts, our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences,
our inwarde parts and affections, to ſee
whether we be in this faith or no, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnfainedly perſuade our ſelues
before the Lorde, that wee haue this true
faith in Ieſus Chriſt: If we haue it, let vs
continue and abide in it to the end, that we
may be ſaued: let vs vſe the godly meanes
and exerciſes of Chriſtianitie, whereby it
may increaſe and waxe ſtronger in vs: let
vs frequent the hearing of ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and the
worde of God, in reading it alſo priuatly,
and let vs ioyne prayer to the Lord, for this
excellent gift of faith. Likewiſe, the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are to be vſed, which are an increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of this faith vnto vs, but with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
let vs often vſe them. Finally the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and ſocietie of the godly ſhall helpe
much to this matter. For as faith is gotten
by theſe meanes, ſo is it continued in vs,
and is loſt, if theſe exerciſes bee away. If
any feele him ſelfe voyde of faith, let him
<pb facs="tcp:10917:161"/>
beſeeche the Lord Ieſus, the author of faith
and giuer of it, and ſay with the Apoſtles,
<hi>Lorde increaſe my faith,</hi> and let him vſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
wayes that I ſpake of euen now, for <hi>faith
commeth by hearing of the word of God.</hi>
which when we heare, the holy Ghoſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in vs: yea, the holy Ghoſt it ſelfe then
commeth into our heartes by hearing the
worde, as it is reported in the Actes, that
<hi>while Peter ſpake, the holy Ghoſt fell on
all them that heard the worde. Actes</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>This fayth is our wedding garment, &amp;
without it, wee ſhall be excluded and ſhut
out from the marriage of the Lambe. It
is the oyle which we muſt alwayes haue
in our lampes in a readineſſe, againſt the
bridegrome come at midnight. As the fire
goeth out for lacke of wood, ſo is fayth
extinguiſhed in vs for lacke of the worde of
God, and earneſt &amp; hearty prayer, wherby
it is mainteyned. The Iewes were cut off
for their meredulitie. Well we ſtand yet by
faith: let vs take heede, leaſt in thinking
we ſtande, we fall. If the true and naturall
oliues were not ſpared, how ſhal we eſcape
that are the wilde oliues, if we prouoke the
Lord? Theſe things although partly they
haue bene touched already, yet they cannot
<pb facs="tcp:10917:161"/>
be ſpoken of too much, ſeeyng they are the
dueties of of all Chriſtians, &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
of the Lord. This doctrine of faith in
Chriſt Ieſus, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are iuſtified by it alone,
&amp; by it obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes without
the works of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, is not priuate to ſome,
but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to al that do vnfeynedly beleeue
it, whether they be rich or poore, prince or
begger, bond or free, Iew or Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tile, in this
countrey or that, al are one in Chriſt Ieſus
who is brother to all alike, and there is no
reſpect of perſons with God, <hi>Actes</hi> 10.
which is a father alike to all that call vpon
him in faith and trueth. This, as it is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and comfortable to all, ſo is it moſt
ſpecially to all them that are afflicted in
minde, to them whoſe calling is but baſe
and abiect in the worlde, to ſuch whom the
worlde maketh no account of, briefly to all
that are in pouerty and miſerie, forſaken of
the worlde for Chriſtes ſake. Neyther is
this doctrine new or ſtrange as the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
doe falſely ſlaunder it, which ſay it
was neuer heard of before the time of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
It is not ſo, this doctrine is as ancient
as the Prophets of God are, &amp; all they are
witneſſes vnto it, and was in the primitiue
Church taught of the Apoſtles. For what
<pb facs="tcp:10917:162"/>
els do we ſay, but that we receiue remiſſion
of ſinnes through faith in Chriſtes name?
And doth not <hi>S. Peter</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Actes</hi> the tenth
chapter ſay the very ſame, and confirmeth
it by the teſtimonies of all the Prophetes?
Marke his wordes wel, for they proue our
purpoſe, and confirme the three points that
we haue ſet downe in this article, firſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we
al are ſinners, ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt doth forgiue
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> freely, &amp; thirdly, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> by faith it is, we lay
holde on this remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. His words are theſe,
euery one of them very effectuall: <hi>To him</hi>
(ſaith hee) meaning Chriſt, of whom hee
made that excellent ſermon, going before
vnto the captaine Cornelius, <hi>giue all the
Prophets witneſſe, that through his name,
all that beleeue in him, ſhal receiue remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſinnes.</hi> Peter doeth ſhewe that this
doctrine which wee teache, is not newe or
hereticall, but catholike, and ſuch as the
Prophetes them ſelues all long agoe did
teache, that by fayth in Chriſt, euery one
that beleeueth, ſhall haue pardon of all his
ſinnes, whether they be committed before
or after baptiſme, whether they be actuall
or originall, or whether they be in thought
or in worde, or in deede: if wee beleue ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly,
they ſhall all bee forgiuen vs for
<pb facs="tcp:10917:162"/>
Chriſts ſake. I ſpeake here nothing of that
great and horrible ſinne againſt the holy
Ghoſt, which is irremiſſible: I hope in the
Lorde, wee ſhall neuer haue any thing to
doe with it, and therefore I will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
of it, or what it is. Let this bee our
comfort, that wee that haue any feare of
God, any loue to Ieſus Chriſt our ſweete
ſauiour, any reuerence to heare his bleſſed
worde and Goſpell, and to receiue his holy
ſacramentes: we (I ſaye) that haue any
motion to theſe thinges, are farre off from
this ſinne, and it ſhall not come nere our
dwellings. You haue heard nowe (dearely
beloued) what it is we haue to learne and
beare away vpon this article, what is the
meaning of it, what partes of doctrine it
doeth conteine in it. This article, and the
beliefe of it is very comfortable, yea, the
ioyfulleſt thing of all others in this life, is
to heare of the remiſſion of ſinnes, and
that of all, when the leaſt of them is able
to plucke vs downe to hell, and there to
holde vs in chaynes of darkeneſſe for euer
and euer, without any hope of recouery,
were it not for his mercies in Ieſus
Chriſt. The Lorde doeth in deede beſtowe
dayly many good and great bleſſings vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10917:163"/>
vs in his mercy, for the which wee ought
continually to thanke him: but this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
of the waſhing away of all our ſinnes
in Chriſtes blood, doeth as farre paſſe and
excell them all, as either the Diamonde
doeth the ſtone in the ſtreate, or els the
pureſt and fineſt golde that may bee, the
filthieſt droſſe and durt that can be founde,
ſo great a grace is it, in Chriſt freely to
haue all our ſinnes wiped out of Gods
remembrance. But nowe let vs giue (as
wee are dieply bounde) moſt humble and
hearty thankes to God the father, for ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde,
to take vpon him our ſinnes, and to beare
them all away in his body, and let vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
thanke this good and bountiful ſauiour
Ieſus Chriſt, for vouchſauing to humble
him ſelfe ſo farre for our ſakes, as to haue
our ſinnes imputed vnto him, and to bee
layde vpon his backe, and to ſuffer the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
dewe for them all. And let vs
alſo pray both night and daye vnto him, to
take them away from vs more and more,
and to kill this raging ſinne within vs, by
the ſcepter of his holy woorde, and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his mighty ſpirite, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:10917:163"/>
ſinne be in vs, as it ſhall be to the
laſt daye, yet it may not reigne in vs, or be
a tyrant ouer vs, but that we may mortifie
it from time to time, vntill wee come to
that ſtate, wherein it ſhall bee cleane put
awaye, and altogether deſtroyed, which
will bee when we ſhall meete together in
the ioyfull and happy reſurrection of our
bodyes, whereof we are to ſpeake in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
following. Theſe thinges the Lorde
God graunt vnto vs al for his ſonnes ſake,
to whome with the holy Ghoſt, be rendred
all prayſe and glorie, and thankeſgiuing,
both nowe and for euer more. Amen.</p>

                  <head>The eleuenth article of

lecture vpon it,
which is,
The reſurrection of the body.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the fourth part of this our
Chriſtian beliefe, which was of
the church, I declared that there
were three conſequents or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
annexed vnto it. The firſt you haue
heard, which was the remiſſion of ſinnes:
Now doth enſue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond, which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
or riſing againe of our fleſh and
bodie. And this article doeth folowe in very
good and apt order after the former: for as
by the firſt Adams ſinne and ours, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
became mortall &amp; ſubiect vnto death:
ſo hauing remiſſion of our ſinnes by Chriſt
the ſecond Adam, our bodies ſhal hereafter
be made immortall, &amp; raiſed from death to
an euerlaſting &amp; better life the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, which
we ſhould haue had in Paradiſe, if Adam &amp;
we had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in our ſtate of innocency.
This reſurrection is the repairing and the
renuing againe of the whole man to a
moſt bleſſed and perfite eſtate of lyfe.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:164"/>
The meaning therefore of this article is
thus much: I that am a Chriſtian, do moſt
certainely beleeue, that not only my body,
but the bodyes of all men, that euer haue
bene from the beginning of the world to
the end of it, ſhall at the laſt day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by the power of Chriſt at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
be rayſed vp againe, (being the ſame
in ſubſtance, but not in qualities) whether
they be rotted in the graue, or burnt in the
flaming fire, or conſumed of beaſtes, or
drowned in the ſea, &amp; deuoured of fiſhes, or
els of birds. And I moreouer beleeue, that
they ſhalbe ioyned to their ſoules inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
at the which reſurrection the godly
ſhall haue a full ende of all their miſeries,
and paynes here; with full poſſeſſion of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life, and that the wicked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
ſhall goe into euerlaſting hel fire,
which is prepared for the deuil and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
This is the true ſenſe and meaning
of this article of the reſurrection. Now let
vs ſee what good leſſons may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of it, for our inſtruction, that wee
may the better profite in the way of true
godlineſſe, and Chriſtianity. Three things
are to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered in this reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Firſt
that according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures, there ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:10917:165"/>
one day be a generall reſurrection of good
and bad. Secondly, to what ende this ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be.
Thirdly, the conſolation and comfort,
that wee may reape and inioy by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
in the applying of it to our owne
conſciences. I am not ignorant, howe that
very many thinges muſt be repeated here,
which haue bene ſpoken of before, both in
the article of Chriſtes reſurrection, which
is a playne confirmation and proofe of this,
and alſo in the other artice of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming
agayne to iudgement, which ſhalbe then
when this article ſhalbe fully accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
vnto vs. Theſe thinges are ſo incident
the one to the other, I meane Chriſtes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and his iudgment and our riſing
againe, that they cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e ſeparated: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
we will by Gods grace ſo ſpeake of
them all, as they ſhall tend to godly edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to the great comfort of all them
that do nowe in theſe laſt and dangerous
dayes mourne in Zion. And albeit ſome
places and reaſons ſhalbe nowe brought
here, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proofe of this article which haue
ben alleaged before: yet it ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
to beare them againe and often, that
wee may the better remember them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:165"/>
wee are all dull in hearing, and
forgetfull of good thinges, ſo fickle is
our memorie. In the Scriptures both
in the Lawe and in the Prophetes, and
alſo in the newe Teſtament, yee haue the
ſame leſſons giuen foorth often vnto you,
eſpecially in the Pſalmes, where the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of the verſe, is either but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition,
or els a more playne declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the former part of the ſentence.
Yea, Saint Paul him ſelfe well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode
this to bee a very profitable and
good thing, to heare one leſſon many
tymes, and therefore ſayde to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,
<hi>It grieueth mee not to wryte
the ſame thinges to you, and for you it
is a ſure thing, chapter</hi> 3. Seeing this is
ſo, let vs then come to our purpoſe, which
is to proue that there ſhall bee a generall
reſurrection of all men. This article is (I
graunt) very harde to bee beleeued, if wee
iudge of it by fleſh &amp; blood only, as farre as
naturall reaſon will extende, but where
fayth is planted, there reaſon hath no
place. And all the woorkes of God, if they
did not paſſe our reaſon and capacitie,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:166"/>
then they were there not ſo wonderfull,
neither ſhould theybe vnſearcheable or paſt
finding out, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> the Apoſtle affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
<hi>Romanes.</hi> 11. ſaying, <hi>O the deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the riches, both of the wiſedome
and knowledge of God!</hi> Many of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſort of the heathen Philoſophers, as
<hi>Plato, Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> although they
were fully perſwaded of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> immortality of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule, yet they neuer did ſo much as once
dreame or thinke of the immortalitie, and
reſurrection of the fleſhe, which we beare
about with vs. So incredible a thing did
it ſeeme vnto them. And therefore <hi>Saint
Paul,</hi> when hee came to <hi>Athens,</hi> and there
preached Chriſt Ieſus vnto them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other good poyntes of Chriſtianitye, &amp;
of our fayth, they heard him indifferently
without any mocking at al: but when he
ſayde and affirmed conſtantly vnto them,
<hi>that God had appoynted a day, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which
he wil iudge the worlde in righteouſneſſe,
by that man whom hee hath appoynted,
wherof he hath giuen an aſſurance to all
men, in that he hath rayſed him from the
dead, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they mocked, becauſe they heard
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſurrection from the dead, Actes</hi> 17.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:166"/>
Well, notwithſtanding al this, we that are
Chriſtians and trayned vp in the ſchole of
Chriſt our maſter, muſt beleeue this point.
For ſurely the ful perſwaſion of this one
article, comprehendeth many other articles
of our fayth: <hi>For if wee riſe not agayne,
then is not Chriſt riſen: if Chriſt be not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
then are we in our ſinnes,</hi> and ſo the
former article that went before, falleth to
the ground. But if this be true, then all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
other going before are confirmed, and out
of doubt. Let vs therefore heare, and marke
alſo ſome infallible teſtimonies, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorityes
of the euerlaſting &amp; true word of
God, to builde our fayth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this ſo hard
&amp; ſtrange a matter to reaſon, &amp; to confirme
vs againſt all tentations of Satan, or of
the wicked and carnal Atheiſts, which wil
goe about to vndermine the veritie of this
article. We haue in the third chapter of the
booke Exodus, a manifeſt proofe of the
reſurrection in theſe woordes, where as
God ſpeaking to Moſes, ſayeth on this
wiſe, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, the God
of Iſahac, and the God of Iacob.</hi> Which
woordes are ſo forcible, that our ſauiour
Chriſt vſed no other argument agaynſt the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:167"/>
                     <hi>Sadduces</hi> which denied this reſurrection.
For God cannot be ſayde to be God of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
except he raiſe him againe, and the
bodye be ioyned to the ſoule. For he calleth
not himſelfe, the God of Abrahams ſoule,
but of Abraham, meaning the whole man.
It was euident therefore that Abraham
with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers, ſhal riſe againe. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
excellent is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of Iob, in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
chapter of his booke. <hi>I knowe</hi>
(ſayeth he) <hi>that my redeemer liueth, and
he ſhal ſtand the laſt on the earth, and
though after this skinne wormes ſhall
deuoure this body, yet ſhall I ſee God in
my fleſh, whom I my ſelfe ſhall ſee, &amp; my
eyes ſhall behold, and none other for me,
though my reines are conſumed with
in me.</hi> We ſee by this, that Iob long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs, or before the newe Teſtament
was written, had a full hope of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
that both body and ſoule ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
the preſence of God at the laſt day.
this is written (as Paul ſayeth) for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
that wee ſhoulde haue the like
hope and aſſurance as hee had, in the
happie and bleſſed reſurrection of our
bodyes after death. This truſt and fayth
had the Prophet Dauid, in the ſixteenth
<pb facs="tcp:10917:167"/>
pſalme, <hi>Thou ſhalt not leaue my body
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graue, neither ſhalt thou ſuffer thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one to ſee corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſix and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
of Eſay we read thus, <hi>Thy dead men
ſhall liue, euen with my body ſhall they
riſe. Awake, and ſing yee that dwell in
duſt, for thy dewe is as the dewe of
herbes, &amp; the earth ſhal caſt out the dead.</hi>
What can be ſpoken more playnly for
this purpoſe. Likewiſe vnder the viſion of
the dry bones, which reuiued and tooke
fleſhe, the Lord would ſhewe vnto Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
that he was able to doe all thinges, and
to bring the people out of captiuitye, which
were as dry bones then rotten and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
And this was a type of the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to the houſe of Iſrael in their baniſhment,
being reſtored to their countrey agayne.
That place of Daniel in the twelft of his
propheſie is moſt euident, <hi>At that tyme,
ſhal Michael ſtand vp, the great prince,
which ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth for the children of thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and there ſhalbe a time of trouble,
ſuch as neuer was ſince there began
to be a nation vnto that ſame time, and at
that time thy people ſhalbe deliuered, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one that ſhalbe written in the booke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and many of them that ſleepe in the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:168"/>
duſt of the earth, ſhall awake, ſome to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting
life, and ſome to perpetuall
ſhame and contempt. And they that be
wiſe, ſhall ſhine as the brightneſſe of the
firmament: and they that turne many to
righteouſneſſe, ſhall ſhine as the ſtarres for
euer and euer.</hi> Here is ſet foorth the riſing
of all men, both good and bad, &amp; the glorie
of the one ſort, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhame and confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
the other. Looke <hi>Matthew 22. Marke 12.
Luke</hi> 20. Our ſauiour Chriſt exhorting
rich men to make feaſtes, and to prouide for
the poore, ſayde, <hi>that they ſhould be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
in the reſurrection of the iuſt, Luk.</hi>
14. Where we may note, that the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is ſayde to be a recompence and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
for the iuſt. And ſurely ſo it is: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord might ſeeme to be vniuſt,
which many times doeth not here reward
the Godly, as he hath promiſed, nor puniſh
the vniuſt, as he hath threatned them. And
<hi>if we truſt in Chriſt only in this life, we are</hi>
(ſayth Paul) <hi>of all men moſt miſerable.</hi>
We hope therefore for another life, and
this is in the reſurrection: this is our ioy &amp;
comfort. I ſee then no cauſe why me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould
be ſo ſory to dye, and depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this world,
ſeeing a better world is kept in ſtore for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:168"/>
I come to the newe Teſtament. In the 6
of Iohn our Sauiour hath a notable place
to confirme this matter vnto vs. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
in that place ſpeaketh of both the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections,
the one from ſinne in this life,
in the 25. verſe, <hi>that the dead ſhould heare
his voyce,</hi> that is, they that were in minde
and fayth dead, ſhould nowe heare his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and be renewed vnto repentance, and ſo
liue a newe life. This ſeemed a ſtrange doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
to the Iewes, and they wondered all
at it. Our Sauiour then goeth farther with
them, &amp; telleth them of more ſtrange things
then theſe, ſaying, <hi>Maruell not at this: for
the houre ſhall come, in the which all that
are in the graues, ſhall heare his voyce, and
they ſhall come foorth, that haue done
good, vnto the reſurrection of life, and they
that haue done ill, vnto the reſurrection of
condemnation.</hi> Martha a woman was wel
perſwaded of this article, for ſhe did beleeue
that her brother <hi>Lazarus ſhoulde be rayſed
vp at the laſt day, Iohn</hi> 11. Againe, if all
nations ſhall bee gathered together before
Chriſt, then all ſhall riſe, that they may bee
iudged: otherwiſe he can not be ſayde to be
the iudge of quicke and dead. Neyther doth
the remayning of ſome aliue till the latter
<pb facs="tcp:10917:169"/>
day hinder this poſition, but that all ſhall
riſe. For they that dyd neuer die, ſhall bee
rayſed vp with newe bodies, which change
ſhall be as the ryſing from the dead, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
weake and corruptible bodies, they
ſhalbe glorified and made heauenly bodies.
If we conſider the power of God whereby
he is able to do all things, euen what he liſt,
and greater thinges then wee can imagine:
then this will not ſeeme hard or abſurde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs. We doe beleeue and confeſſe, that he
is almightie in the firſt article, and therfore
we muſt needes confeſſe that hee can doe it,
as eaſily as he rayſed vp the bodie of Chriſt,
wherein he hath giuen the aſſurance of the
whole Church. And he that made al things
of nothing at the firſt by his onely worde, is
able alſo nowe to bring to paſſe that of duſt
and earth ſhall bodies be rayſed vp againe.
Saint Paul coulde not bee brought from
this perſwaſion by any meanes, eyther by
feare or diſpleaſure of the Sadduces, or of
Agrippa: or Feſtus, but he proteſted, that
<hi>he had hope towarde God, that the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the dead, which dyd ſeeme an
incredible thing vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Act. 26. ſhoulde
bee both of iuſt and vniuſt, Act.</hi> 24. The
hope of this reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made Saint Paul,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:169"/>
as it ſhoulde doe vs, to do his duetie round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
for herein (ſaieth he) <hi>I endeuour my
ſelfe to haue alwayes a cleare conſcience
towarde God, and toward men.</hi> For vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for this cauſe doe many men make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke
of fayth and conſcience in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and affayres of this life, becauſe they
haue quite forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this day of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherein an account muſt be giuen, not
onely of wicked deedes and blaſphemous
wordes, <hi>but of euery idle worde ſpoken,
as our Sauiour ſayeth, Matth.</hi> 12. If wee
woulde conſider this, howe wee muſt all
ſtande naked before the hie tribunall ſeate
of Chriſt Ieſus, it woulde ſurely make vs
to tremble &amp; to quake euery veine and ioynt
in vs, when we thinke vpon it. The day ſhal
be fearefull and terrible, I hope there is no
man among vs that doubteth of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of this day, although the day and houre
it ſelfe be knowen to no man. And this is to
make vs alwayes to be in a readineſſe for it.
<hi>For it ſhal come vpon a ſudden, 1. Theſ.</hi> 5.
I ſhould be long and ouer tedious, and not
ſeeme to write a Lecture to exhort &amp; teach,
but rather a treatiſe to conuince the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
and wicked, if I ſhoulde recken vp all
the places that here myght be brought for
<pb facs="tcp:10917:170"/>
the confirmation of this doctrine. Let theſe
therefore for this time ſuffice: and if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
reader be diſpoſed to ſee moe, let him
reade the 15. Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to
the Corinthians, there he ſhall haue a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcourſe &amp; handling of this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of ſet purpoſe, Paul prouing the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
by many reaſons, both diuine and
humane, and ſhewing moreouer with what
qualities, conditions and properties the
bodies of the faythfull ſhall be rayſed vp:
where he alſo anſwereth the obiections that
may bee made to the contrary. I conclude
this part with the wordes of Saint Paul to
the Philippians the thirde Chapter: <hi>Let
our conuerſation be in heauen, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence
we looke for the ſauiour, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
that it may be faſhioned like vnto his
glorious body, according to the working
whereby he is able eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſubdue al things
vnto him ſelfe.</hi> In theſe words he ſheweth
that Gods power is able to doe this, and
although our bodies bee vile, they ſhall bee
made fayre againe: trees ſeeme to be dead
and rotten in the winter, which in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpring
time come forth moſt floriſhingly with their
fruite in due ſeaſon: ſo it is in the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:170"/>
This made the fathers ſo carefully to
burie the dead with their balmes &amp; odours,
knowing they ſhould appeare againe. Laſt
of all, I referre you to the 2. Pet. 7. Chap.
&amp; Reue. 20. where this reſurrection is moſt
liuely, as in a table before your eyes, deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
It followeth in the ſecond place, to ſee
to what ende this great reſurrection ſhall
be. We haue ſeene the efficient and chiefe
cauſ of this reſurrection, to be the power
of God mightily woorking in him ſelfe.
The fourme of it is, the ioyning and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
together of the body &amp; ſoule for euer:
and the matter wherein this doeth ſtande, is
the ſoule and body of man, which muſt bee
repayred againe, being once corrupted by
ſinne in our firſt grandfather Adam, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in vs his children, ſpringing of the ſame
corrupt roote with him. The finall cauſe
why this reſurrection ſhall bee, is of two
ſortes: the one is in the reſpect of the good
and godly men, who haue liued here in
the feare of the Lord, to his honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
in theſe he will ſhewe his exceeding
great mercie, in making them veſſels of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to ſerue him, whome he will rewarde
with euerlaſting life, which yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they haue not of duetie deſerued,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:171"/>
(as the Papiſts ſay) but in mercie doeth the
Lorde beſtowe it vpon them. The other
cauſe is in reſpect of the wicked and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
vpon whom the Lorde will ſhewe his
perfite iuſtice againſt ſinne and wickednes,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without repentance. Theſe
will hee make veſſels of his wrath, which
ſhal burne in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with an vnquenchable fire,
without ende and mercie, who becauſe here
they haue not bene throughly puniſhed, or
ſometimes not at all, therefore the full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of their puniſhment is reſerued til that
great day, then to be powred out vpon them
in fire and brimſtone, in that burning lake
continually which neuer ſhall haue ende.
For theſe cauſes is this reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
wee ſpeake) ordayned. To ſpeake of the
end for the godly, firſt, ſo it is that the Lord
hath promiſed in mercie to reward all his
faythfull ſeruants, which commeth not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
times to paſſe in this life, therefore there
remaineth a life to come to be ſhewed in the
reſurrection of the fleſh. And if all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
bee ſure to bee recompenſed with a
promiſe of a good turne in the life to come
(as Paul declareth to Timothie the firſt
Epiſtle and fourth Chapter) Then out of
all doubt very expedient and neceſſarie it
<pb facs="tcp:10917:171"/>
is, that there ſhoulde be a reſurrection. If
any man ſay. The ſoules of the faythfull are
rewarded as ſoone as they depart from the
bodie, with this promiſe of life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſeeme not to lacke a rewarde, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there be no reſurrection, and ſo
God is true of his promiſe: I anſwere, that
as the bodyes of the faythfull while they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
well here, haue bene temples of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Ghoſt, to ſerue the Lord withall, and as
not onely in ſoule, but alſo in body through
diuers tentations and perſecutions they
haue bene afflicted for Chriſt, and haue
ſtill bene vnder the croſſe: ſo ſurely, they
alſo with the ſoule ſhall be glorified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
according to the things that they
haue done. And to this agree the wordes of
the holy Apoſtle: <hi>We muſt all</hi> (ſayeth he)
<hi>appeare before the iudgement ſeate of
Chriſt, that euery man may receyue the
things which are done in his body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that he hath done, whether it bee
good or euill, 2. Corin.</hi> 5. Here he nameth
expreſly the body, otherwiſe the rewarde
were vnperfite, if in one part onely it were
beſtowed. The Lord will not ſuffer the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of a cuppe of colde water to his ſaints
to goe vnrewarded, much more therefore
<pb facs="tcp:10917:172"/>
will he rewarde thoſe that haue giuen their
bodies to be conſumed in the flames of fire
for his cauſe and the Goſpel: ſo that if any
loſe his life for his ſake in this worlde, he
ſhall finde it in the worlde to come, with an
hundred fold more, with all happineſſe and
ioy reſtored vnto him. If we looke vpon all
the ſaints that haue bene from time to time,
we ſhall ſee that they had no felicitie, nor
happineſſe in this life. The Epiſtle to the
Hebrewes, ſpeaking of the excellent fayth
of the olde Patriarkes and ancient fathers,
ſheweth vs what was their eſtate in this
life, for their good woorkes and deedes:
<hi>Some were racked and woulde not bee
deliuered, others were tryed by moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
and ſcourginges, by bandes and
impriſonment, they were ſtoned, they
were hewen aſunder, they were tempted,
they were ſlayne with the ſworde, they
wandered vp &amp; downe in goates skinnes,
and ſheepes skinnes, being deſtitute, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
and tormented, wandring in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes,
and mountaynes, and dennes
and caues of the earth.</hi> If we aſke the end,
why they ſuffered and endured ſuch things
of the wicked, the ſame Apoſtle doeth make
vs anſwere, <hi>This they did, that they might
<pb facs="tcp:10917:172"/>
receiue a better reſurrection.</hi> And ſurely
they had bene fooles to endure ſuch torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
of body, if the body and ſoule had periſhed
in their death and graue, as doe the bodies
of bruite beaſtes, without any hope of the
reſurrection. Conſider ye the Apoſtles, how
they were rewarded here for their preaching
and godly life: did they not all for the moſt
part, in the ende ſuffer death and martyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
for their labour? howe was Paul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
of the Lorde in this life? did hee not
whippe and ſcourge him when hee receiued
him for his ſonne? yes truely. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
what his whole life was after his
conuerſion: nothing but a ſea of troubles
&amp; miſeries, fightings without, and terrours
within, hunger and thirſt, colde, nakedneſſe,
bandes and pouertie were the rewardes
that the Lorde gaue him here, inſomuch,
that hee might ſeeme to be in worſe caſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his conuerſion to Chriſt, then before, if
hee had iudged of his afflictions by a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and carnal eye, and not according to faith,
as did carnall Demas, and therefore becauſe
hee felt miſeries in this life, in Chriſtianitie
reuolted from Paul, and embraced this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
euill worlde, 2. Timothie 4. Theſe
things made Paul to ſay, <hi>that vnleſſe there
<pb facs="tcp:10917:173"/>
were a reſurrection, his ſtate had bene moſt
miſerable of al others, for what</hi> (ſaith hee)
<hi>aduantageth it me to ſuffer theſe things, if
the dead riſe not agayne, then let vs eate
and drinke, and liue in pleaſure.</hi> So we ſee
the hope of the reſurrection ſtayed him from
running into condemnation with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
&amp; he confeſſed els where, that his crown
was not here in this life, but was layde vp
for him. And al theſe vexations of the bodies,
of ſoules, of mindes and conſciences of men,
is to teach them that no bleſſedneſſe is to bee
hoped for in this our vale of miſerie: but
we looke for a citie to come, whoſe builder
and maker is God, ſeeing wee haue none
here that is permanent. Our ſauiour, when
he comforted his diſciples agaynſt perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
to come, when as they ſhoulde bee
mocked, reuiled, taunted, yea and killed for
his ſake, willed them in that day to be glad
and to reioyce, for their rewarde was great
in heauen. Hee ſaid not in earth, that their
mindes might be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this life to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
euerlaſting reſt out of this world. And this
can not be, but in the reſurrection of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
They y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will haue their reward in this
life, in ſhort &amp; tranſitorie pleaſures of ſinne
for a ſeaſon, feaſting &amp; ſporting them ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:10917:173"/>
in their wantonnes &amp; vngodly delites, &amp; are
impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to looke &amp; wait for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauenly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of ioyes, that ſhal haue no ende, are
like vnto the rich man both proude and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonous,
that fared deliciouſly euery day, and
went in purple and ſilke, not regarding the
poore eſtate of Lazarus, and therefore nowe
in hel receiueth paine &amp; puniſhment endles,
which in his life time receiued pleaſure &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
But they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; quiet minds
can take al things in good worth, whether it
be ſicknes or pouertie, or ſhame &amp; ignominie,
which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord here ſendeth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this life,
for a trial of their faith, &amp; can looke vp vnto y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
celeſtial life to come, tarying the Lords lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
theſe men are like to poore Lazarus,
which in deed in his life time receiued paine,
but is now comforted beyond all ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an euerlaſting comfort, Luke 16.
Dauid pronounceth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>bleſſed that feare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Lord,</hi> &amp; yet if we reſpect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time, it doth
not ſo appeare to vs, but rather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary:
for what bleſſednes is here, either in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body,
or in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule, if we ſpeake of a ſounde &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
happines, as he mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it? The ſoule is infec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſinne, the vnderſtanding is darkned, &amp;
the things we know not are moe in number,
then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things we know: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our knowledge
<pb facs="tcp:10917:174"/>
which ſhould beautifie and adorne out ſoule,
is vnperfect: and this not onely in thinges
naturall and ciuill, but alſo in heauenly my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,
and matters of greateſt waight &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance:
ſo that Paul might well crye out
and ſay, <hi>O mortall man that I am, who
ſhall deliuer mee from the body of this
death.</hi> Rom. 7. No happineſſe therefore in
this life of the minde of man, but that which
is, is rather a ſhadowe and a viſour, then
any true ſight of happineſſe. <hi>For it doeth
not yet appeare what we ſhal be, although
nowe we are the ſonnes of God: but this
ſhall appeare when Chriſt ſhall come in
glory,</hi> Coloſ. 3. Now if any griefe of mind
which is inwarde, come to the ſoule, then it
ſeemeth to bee in hell, and this dolour ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth
all the paſſions and paynes of
the body. Let any man conſider the bodie,
and he will ſay that it can not bee happie in
this life: the diſeaſes and ſickneſſes of it
are ſo many in number, that they haue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the arte and ſkil of the beſt Phyſitions to
heale them. And if the diſeaſes of the body
were away, yet were there calamities a
thouſand to proue it to be in a very wretched
caſe, as longe as it is ſubiect to ſinne in
this pylgrimage. What croſſes are ſhame
<pb facs="tcp:10917:174"/>
to vs, &amp; ignominie, contempt and reproche,
which cauſe many moſt deſperately to hang
themſelues? What is pouertie with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
as lacke of friendes, meate and drinke,
want of apparell which is neceſſarie, lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and houſe roome, with ſuch thinges?
Theſe miſeries a man may haue, although
hee had health of body, although yet theſe
thinges bring ſickenes with them common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
What then are other externall dangers,
as the wounding and hurting of our ſelues,
the ſpoyling of our goods, dangers vpon
the land of theeues, &amp; vpon the ſea of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
and if we ſcape that, there is danger of
vngodly Pirates. Theſe croſſes being
layde together, and weyed in the balance of
iuſtice, wil cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terpeiſe &amp; ouerweigh al our
pleaſures that are, or may bee inuented in
this life: ſo great is the heape of miſeries in
this life. And theſe troubles that I haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
rehearſed, as they are common to all,
ſo eſpecially to the godly, to make them not
to bee in loue with this worlde, ſeeing the
Lorde hath reſerued the bleſſed reſurrection
for them. Wherefore (dearly beloued) call
now to remembrance the dayes that are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and conſider the ſayntes, which after
they had receiued light, endured a great
<pb facs="tcp:10917:175"/>
fight in afflictions, as our martyrs did in
Q. Maries dayes, partly while they were
made a gazing ſtocke, both by reproches &amp;
afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s being toſſed to &amp; fro, &amp; ſuffered w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
ioy the ſpoyling of their goods. And knowe
you deare brethren, that ye haue in heauen a
better and a more induring ſubſtance then al
the golde &amp; ſiluer of princes. Caſt not away
therefore your confidence which hath great
recompence of reward in this day of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of your bodies. For ye haue neede
of patience, that after ye haue done the will
of the Lorde, yee may receiue the promiſe of
eternall life. For yet a very litle while, and
Ieſus Chriſt the authour of this reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that ſhall come, will come, and will not
tary. Thus much for the ende of this reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in reſpect of the ſeruantes of Chriſt,
which then, and not before ſhall fully be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
and made perfitely bleſſed in euery
part, both body and ſoule, wherein they haue
ſerued their Lorde faythfully, when they
were aliue. Nowe let vs ſee the ende, for
the which all the wicked ſhall riſe againe
at that day, which alſo ſtandeth with the
iuſtice of the Lorde, to recompence them
after their demerites. As not onely the
ſoules of the wicked haue offended their
<pb facs="tcp:10917:175"/>
GOD by their ſinnefull thoughtes and
cogitations, but alſo their bodyes haue
bene ſlaues vnto ſinne, and haue giuen
their members ouer to ſerue vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
ſo it ſtandeth with equitie, that not
onely their mindes and conſciences be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
but alſo their bodyes, by the which
they here haue wrought all theſe abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſhould feele the rewarde &amp; ſtipende of
ſinne, which is the euerlaſting death, euen
the ſeconde death of the ſoule and body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
This puniſhment is deferred moſt
commonly in this life, and who in ſo good
eſtate, as concerning the bodie here, as the
wicked and ſuch as contemne the Lorde:
In ſo much that their proſperitie &amp; wealth,
haue moued the godly to wonder at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
iudgements of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord in this their caſe.
This thing mooued the Prophete Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk
to crye vnto the Lorde for vengeance
agaynſt the wicked, being troubled with
their proſperitie and ſucceſſe. <hi>Wherefore
doeſt thou looke</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>vpon the
tranſgreſſours, and holdeſt thy tongue,
when the wicked deuoureth the man that
is more righteous then hee, whereof they
reioyce and are glad.</hi> Habakkuk 1.
This complaynt likewiſe made the prophet
<pb facs="tcp:10917:176"/>
Ieremie in his time, in the 12. of his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
ſaying, <hi>O Lord, if I diſpute with thee,
thou art righteous, yet let mee talke with
thee of thy iudgementes: wherefore doeth
the way of the vngodly proſper? why are
they in wealth, that rebelliouſly tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſe?</hi>
Theſe were Ieremies words co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the
ill men: but he addeth more, Thou haſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, and they haue taken roote, they
growe and bring foorth fruite: thou art
neere in their mouth, and farre from their
reynes. Dauid founde by experience the
like ſucceſſe of the wicked in his dayes alſo,
and therefore ſaith that hee fretted at the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
when hee ſawe the proſperitie of the
wicked: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>there are no bandes
in their death, but they are luſty &amp; ſtrong:
they are not in trouble as other men, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are they plagued with other men.
Therefore pride is as a chaine vnto them,
and cruelty couereth them as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
their eyes ſtand out for fatneſſe: they
haue more then heart can wiſhe: they are
licentious, &amp; ſpeake wickedly of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion:
they talke preſumptuouſly: they
ſet their mouth againſt heauen, and their
tongue walketh through the earth.</hi> Here
you haue a deſcription of their life, and of
<pb facs="tcp:10917:176"/>
their proſperitie, what the one is, &amp; what
the other is alſo, their life is licentious, and
yet it goeth well with them for theſe tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
goods: but what doth Dauid confeſſe
of him ſelfe, which was the childe of God?
<hi>Daily</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>haue I bene puniſhed and
chaſtened euery morning, Pſal.</hi> 73. Seeing
this ſtandeth ſo with the wicked, ſhall wee
not ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhalbe puniſhed elſewhere?
Yes no doubt, there is a iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t day kept
in ſtore for them, where they ſhall be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
although they haue liued in pleaſure
here: otherwiſe the Lorde ſhould not bee
iuſt. Looke vpon the 21. chap. of <hi>Iob,</hi> and
you ſhall ſee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> long before Dauid, he tooke
vp the like complaint, then, when he ſawe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
wealth &amp; eaſe in this life of the godleſſe, &amp;
contemners of religion. We ſee howe the
Iewes, the children of God were ſtil afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of their enemies, &amp; kept vnder the rod,
when as their perſecutors, the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
                     <hi>Caldeans,</hi> the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the
<hi>Romanes,</hi> with the reſt, liued in al wealth,
peace and worldly proſperitie. It remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
therfore, that they one day ſhould feele
the rewarde of ſinne in their bodies which
haue ſinned: the which thing ſeldome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to effect in this preſent ſtate of life.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:177"/>
The Lord hath ſaid by <hi>Eſaie</hi> his Prophet in
the 65. chap. <hi>Behold, my ſeruants ſhal eate,
and ye ſhal be hungry: behold, my ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
ſhall drinke, and ye ſhalbe thirſty: behold,
my ſeruants ſhal reioyce, and ye ſhalbe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed:
behold, my ſeruants ſhal ſing for
ioy of heart, and ye ſhall crie for ſorow of
heart, and ſhal houle for vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of minde.</hi>
Although this be ſomewhat accompliſhed,
euen here vnder the kingdome of grace,
wherby the godly do reioyce, &amp; the wicked
are ſomewhat quailed: yet ſhall it eſpecially
be ſeene in the kingdome of glory, when the
elect ſhalbe fully ſet in ſure poſſeſſion of all
ioyes, and the wicked haue full meaſure of
all their deſerued puniſhments. To end the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
this matter, the vſe of this doctrine is this:
ſeeing the wicked ſhalbe rewarded ſeuen
fold into their boſome, and ſhall make and
giue an account very ſtrait of all their
life wickedly &amp; vngraciouſly ſpent vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
earth: let not vs freat at them before the
time, as Dauid counſelleth vs, neither let
vs enuy their hie &amp; ſo proſperous eſtate, <hi>for
they ſhall ſoone be cut down like graſſe, &amp;
ſhall wither as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greene herbe.</hi> Lo, ſee their
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance, &amp; to what thing it is likened of
the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. The third thing in
<pb facs="tcp:10917:177"/>
this reſurrection, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comfort that thereby
doth enſue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly, when they thinke &amp;
meditate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, which ſurely is very great.
For they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are wel perſwaded in minde of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their bodies, can not but at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
laſt houre of death depart ioyfully &amp; merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of this life, yea &amp; deſire this day, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
faithful and godly do, as Paul did: <hi>I deſire</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>to be loſed, &amp; to be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt.</hi> The
hope &amp; great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſurrection made
him to pray ſo. But they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are not fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
of this true article, die very vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
&amp; with griefe &amp; ſorow of mind, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
they ſhal loſe all pleaſure here, &amp; inioy
none in the life to come, as the Epicures &amp;
belly gods do imagine, whoſe liues &amp; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are moſt liuely ſet forth in the ſecond
of Wiſdom, which chapter I would great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wiſhe to be read of all men. Againe, the
ſure beliefe of this doth comfort vs, when
we haue here loſt our deare friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
becauſe one day we ſhal inioye
their company againe. So did Paul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the <hi>Theſſalonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>they ſhould not be
fory for them that were dead, as thoſe that
haue no hope,</hi> that they ſhal ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe:
as the heathens did, who lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted out of al
meaſure for their frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, as in deede hauing
<pb facs="tcp:10917:178"/>
no hope at al of the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as we ſee it
came to paſſe in <hi>Cicero,</hi> who could not be
comforted for the death of his daughter
<hi>Tulliola,</hi> whom he loued ſo well, although
his friend <hi>Seruius</hi> wrote moſt comfortably
vnto him. The cogitation hereof doeth
arme vs againſt all perſecutions, to ſuffer
all thinges with a quiet and ioyfull mynde,
as the martyrs did endure all kindes of
tormentes in their bodies, becauſe they
knewe their bodies ſhould bee after a more
excellent and glorious ſort, reſtored to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
againe in an other life. Furthermore, this
will cauſe vs to abſtaine from all vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
pleaſures of the fleſh and of ſinne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
we ſhall haue pleaſures in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
without ende, and that wee ſhall
reape there ioy without wearines, if wee
faint not here. With this reſurrection did
<hi>Iob</hi> comfort him ſelfe in his greateſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
ſaying, <hi>I knowe that my redeemer
liueth, and that I ſhall ſee him in my fleſh,
Iob</hi> 19. This was the comfort of Paul in
all his perſecutions that hee ſuffered for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Goſpel of Chriſt, that the dead ſhould riſe
againe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good to glorie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked to ſhame
and reproche, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Our ſauiour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
rich men in this lyfe, to <hi>giue almes
<pb facs="tcp:10917:178"/>
to the poore, becauſe they ſhould be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
in the reſurrection of the iuſt, Luk.
14. Eſay</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> afflicted church in his
time with hope of the reſurrection, ſaying,
<hi>Thy dead ſhal riſe, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with my body ſhal
they riſe, Eſaie</hi> 26. And what is els the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the godly at this day in ſuch ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
times, and dangerous dayes of ſinne,
but onely the ſure hope of this bleſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
This is a comfort to euery god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man, when he thinketh vpon it. For this
day is called <hi>the reſtoring of all things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to their former perfection, Act.</hi> 3. It
would greatly reioyce the lame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to heare that all his limmes ſhould bee
reſtored againe perfectly as they were at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
firſt. Likewiſe, it would make glad y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart
of the naked, to heare that he ſhould be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with moſt pretious garments of ſilke
and gold. And why then ſhould not we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
ten thouſand times more, to heare
that we ſhall be reſtored to all integritie of
body and ſoule, and clothed with moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
and pure innocency of life for euer and
euer? For our comfort, this day is likened
to the pleaſant time of harueſt, wherein the
godly ſhall be gathered into the barne of
Chriſt as pure wheat, and the wicked caſt
<pb facs="tcp:10917:179"/>
out into the fire, as the vnprofitable chaffe
good for nothing, Matth. 13. So that they
which ſowe here in teares, ſhall there reape
in ioy. This day is alſo termed by Chriſt &amp;
Paul, the day of the redemption of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
from all miſeries: for they ſhall bee
no more ſicke, weake, deformed, lame, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
hungry, thirſty, and that which is the
greateſt of all, they ſhall ceaſe from ſinning
any more, for they ſhal be like the glorious
body of Ieſus Chriſt, without ſpot or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh.
And is not this a ſingular comfort?
The fineſt body here, is but a carion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the fouleſt there. In this day, <hi>the
righteous ſhall haue dominion ouer the
wicked, Pſalm.</hi> 49. Dauid when he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of this day ſo ioyfull, ſayde, <hi>that his
heart did reioyce, becauſe his body ſhould
not for euer be left in the graue, Pſalm.</hi> 16.
This day is called of Paul to <hi>Titus 2. The
bleſſed hope,</hi> of the effect which it hath to
make vs there all bleſſed without ende in
ioy vnſpeakeable. This reſurrection,
which leadeth vnto euerlaſting life, may
well be likened to the laſt doore, that in the
court or palace of kings, leadeth into the
princes priuy chamber, or the chamber of
preſence: (for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can haue no acceſſe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:179"/>
vntill he haue paſſed through many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doores and houſes:) ſo ſurely it is in
the life to come. We can not come or enter
into the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen the priuy
chamber of Ieſus Chriſt, and there behold
his preſence, except we firſt paſſe by many
doores in this life, which doe leade vs thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
as for example, we muſt firſt paſſe by
our election, then by our creation, thirdly,
by our redemption, wrought by Chriſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the croſſe, fourthly, by iuſtification, fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by ſanctification of life, and laſt of all,
we muſt come to the reſurrection, as the
laſt doore, if we will haue our finall glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
which is euerlaſting life, to beholde
and inioy the ſweete and louing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Lorde. Yea Paul goeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſayth, <hi>that by many tribulations,</hi>
as ſtrayte doores and gates, which wring
vs, <hi>wee muſt enter into the kingdome of
God.</hi> Needes therefore muſt the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be ioyfull, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it leadeth vs directly
to ſuch a palace of pleaſure, as ſhall neuer
ende, &amp; therefore is called of <hi>Peter, the time
of refreſhing, both of bodye and ſoule,
in the preſence of the Lorde, Actes</hi> 3. The
holy Apoſtle willed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them ſelues with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioyfull reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance
<pb facs="tcp:10917:180"/>
of this day. 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. For it ſhalbe vnto
vs as a new birth, or natiuitie in al purenes,
And if wee ſo celebrate the dayes of our
birth, wherein we were borne into a vale of
myſerye and troubles, howe ought wee to
celebrate and keepe holy this day, wherein
we ſhall be exempted from all curſes of
this preſent life! This day is termed our
marriage day: if we reioyce here when we
are married to a mortall creature, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
to our greater payne, and trouble
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, oh dearely beloued, how ſhould
we be affected, &amp; what tokens of ioy ought
we to ſhewe foorth, when wee ſhalbe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
to the ſonne of God Chriſt Ieſus for
euer in fayth and trueth, with a band which
neuer ſhalbe broken! as the Lord ſpeaketh
in <hi>Oſe</hi> 2. chapter, and <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 19. In this
day ſhall the gates of heauen be ſet wide
open vnto vs, which were ſhut vp before, &amp;
our bodies ſhall ſo much excell the bodyes
which we now beare about with vs, as the
ſunne doeth paſſe and ouercome the moone
in brightneſſe and light. O what a ioye is
this to haue our eſtate like vnto the bleſſed
Angels of God, moſt pure and diuine cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures!
If this cannot moue vs, I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may doe it. I am ſure this reward
<pb facs="tcp:10917:180"/>
ſo moued good Moſes, that hee forſooke
the kingdome in Egypt, and ſuffered paine
with the people of God, to come to this life
in the ende, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. Yea, this hope of life
to come, made Abraham to leaue his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and to goe to the land of Canaan as a
poore ſtranger, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. This made Paul
to go through thicke and thinne in this life,
that he might attayne to the reſurrection,
when he had ſeene the ioyes and pleaſures,
that were ſhewed vnto him in Paradiſe,
when hee was taken vp thither, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
Of this ioy, our Sauiour gaue his diſciples
a taſt in the Mount, when hee was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
before them: but it was nothing in
reſpect of this. Nowe as theſe thinges are
moſt comfortable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly, to heare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their
bodyes ſhall be rayſed vp to ſuch glory:
So is this day moſt fearefull to the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which haue here liued a diſſolute life: For
they ſhall ſay at that day to the hilles, Fall
vpon vs, and to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mountaynes, Couer vs.
but this ſhall not preuayle, for they ſhalbe
raiſed vp, but to their ſhame and confuſion
for euer, as Daniel ſaith, <hi>Cha. 12. They ſhal
come forth (as our ſauiour ſayth,) but to
the reſurrection of condemnation,</hi> and ſo
to be puniſhed from the preſence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord
<pb facs="tcp:10917:181"/>
Ieſus, with the <hi>worme of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, which
ſhal neuer leaue to bite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fire
which ſhal not be quenched:</hi> So they ſhal
periſh worthily through their owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and receiue the wages of vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as they which count it pleaſure, dayly
to liue dilitiouſly. Theſe men would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
wiſhe that this day might neuer be:
but it ſhal come vpon them, and that ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
and they ſhalbe taken and ſnared, &amp;
not eſcape this iudgement. For they muſt
yeeld an accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of al their vngodly works,
wherby they haue both diſpleaſed the Lord,
and euil intreated his ſayntes here vpon
earth. Thus you haue heard (dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
brethren) the treatiſe of the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the ſcriptures diſcourſed. Firſt how
that there is a generall riſing of all fleſhe.
Secondly, the endes wherefore it is orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
and then the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable doctrine, that
the godly by this may lay hold on, in all
miſeries of this life. Nowe it remayneth
for a finall concluſion, that while we liue
here, we indeuour to haue our part in the
firſt reſurrection with Chriſt, that we may
by this come to the ſecond, and be bleſſed
with him. Let vs therefore giue thankes to
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who is the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb facs="tcp:10917:181"/>
and the life, in that he hath vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
to giue vnto vs an aſſurance of it, in his
owne perſon, in that he roſe againe from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
dead. And let vs likewiſe pray vnto him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
we may ſo liue, as we may be children of
this happy reſurrection to life, hauing an
effectual fayth, with charitie which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
by loue in vs, that al our actions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer,
may be ſeaſoned &amp; powdered with
it, preparing our ſelues againſt this day,
with mortifying of our fleſh: &amp; ſeeing wee
ſhal meete ſo victorious &amp; glorious a Lord,
comming in the cloudes, let vs purge our
ſelues from all filthineſſe of the fleſhe and
ſpirit, for no vncleane thing ſhall enter in
with him. God for his ſonnes ſake, giue vs
the grace to doe theſe things: to the which
bleſſed and immortall God with the ſonne,
and the holy Ghoſt, be rendred all prayſe,
glory and thankeſgiuing, for euermore.
Amen.</p>

Here Chriſt expreſſed ſpirituall thinges by

nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart &amp; mind of man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poſſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
&amp; imagine, which paſſe al vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ought to make vs wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amaſed &amp; aſtonied, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
they do ſo far exceede our capacitie, &amp; reach
of wit. The excellencie of this life may be
ſeene in theſe 2. things: firſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> happines
of our ſoule: then in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> welfare of our body.
As touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule, it ſhalbe moſt happy,
for it ſhal ceaſe to ſin, &amp; ſhalbe wholy ioyned
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord in faith &amp; truth, &amp; neuer diſpleaſe
him any more. What a great ioy is this! A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal beautify our ſoule,
ſhalbe moſt perfit: our knowledge, our wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
our vnderſtanding, which here is all
darkned, ſhal there be inlightned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory
<pb facs="tcp:10917:184"/>
and light of the Lorde: all vertues and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of the minde ſhal abound in vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the full, and euery thing that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfite,
ſhalbe then done away, no griefe of
the minde, no ſorow of heart, no torment
of conſcience any more, but peace, ioy and
tranquillity euer to endure. This is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
wherein wee were firſt created, and
ſhall then be renewed to a more perfite e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
of life, then it was in before the fall of
Adam. Our ſoule there ſhall not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
to the body, neither ſhall the ſpirit
rebel agaynſt the fleſhe, but it ſhall loue the
Lord with all his might. And if the ioy of
the minde and ſoule be ſo great here many
times in the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, that they ſeeme
to be in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what ſhal it be there (thinke
yee) when it ſhalbe in full poſſeſſion of all
his delights and ſpirituall pleaſures, euer
ſinging and making ſweete melody to the
Lorde, and yet without any wearyneſſe at
al? For olde things are al paſſed away, and
behold, all things ſhal become new againe,
and the thinges that are there, ſhalbe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
For Chriſt ſhall giue vnto all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. This is the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the ſoule. Now let vs ſee the bleſſed
eſtate alſo of the body, and that ſhall the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:184"/>
better appeare, if we compare it with the
ſtate that it is in here. Our bodies are nowe
deformed, there they ſhall be moſt faire and
beautifull, yea that which is more, they ſhal
be like the glorious and immortall bodie of
Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe. Here the body is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times maymed and vnperfit, there it ſhal
be perfite and in his integritie: here it is in
ſickeneſſe, in pouertie, in nakedneſſe, in
woundes, in ſtripes, in botches, in ſores, and
in all incurable diſeaſes: there ſhall it bee
whole and all ſounde, rich and glorious, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with innocency, and neuer able to feele
any infirmitie any more. For heere it is
ſowen in diſhonour, in weakeneſſe, in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:
and there it riſeth in honour, in
power, in incorruption and immortalitie.
Here be many things that make it to offend
agaynſt God: there is nothing that ſhall
cauſe it to ſinne: it ſhall not, as it did here,
luſt againſt the ſpirit, but be at peace and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
with it: the ſight of it moſt quicke in
ſeeing, and very perfite it ſhall be in all the
ſenſes, in hearing, in ſmelling, in taſting, in
handling. It ſhall haue all melody and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſike
to delite the eare, euen angels ſinging
continually: it ſhall haue all ſightes and
ſhewes to delite and pleaſe the eye, euen the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:185"/>
perpetuall preſence of the bleſſed Trinitie.
All odoriferous ſmels, as it were of muſks,
perfumes, flowers, the ſweete incenſe of
praiſe and thankeſgiuing, to ſmell delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
in the noſtrels of the Lorde, and ours,
ſhall not there be wanting. O what a ioye
is this to the bodie, to haue all thinges at
commaundement, that may well pleaſe and
delight it! The pleaſures of Kinges and
Queenes are nothing to thoſe things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we ſpeake, yea the pleaſures ſhalbe ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great, that if all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioyes &amp; paſtimes
of this life were compared vnto them, they
ſhould be founde to be but pangues and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Yea the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of all our delites
here for an hundred yeres, is not like to the
bleſſednes of one minute of an houre there,
nor worthy to be likened vnto it. For vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſpeake with Dauid, <hi>I had rather be
there but for one daye, then here a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
yeeres,</hi> in all the triumphes that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
and Kings can make with all their
power. This is then the happines of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
Now howe great ſhall the bleſſedneſſe
be, when both the body and ſoule ſhalbe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
together, and raigne for euermore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Surely as great as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of the Lorde is,
&amp; his excellent Maieſtie, which is infinite:
<pb facs="tcp:10917:185"/>
ſo great ſhall this glory of the Saintes be.
The loue of this life, which is euerlaſting,
ſhould make (me thinks) kings &amp; princes to
do their dueties to the Lord, to raigne ouer,
&amp; gouerne their ſubiects in iuſtice &amp; equity,
and not to liue in pleaſures. The reſpect of
theſe ioyes ſhoulde make Counſellers to
ſpeake the trueth boldely, &amp; ſyncerely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
flattering and diſſimulation to princes,
conſidering what a rewarde is layde vp for
them in heauen. This ſhoulde make all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and miniſters of the worde, to do their
duetie in reprehending ſinne ſtoutly, and in
contemning this vayne worlde, in teaching
the flock without lucre &amp; gayne, ſeeing that
<hi>when the great ſhepherd Ieſus Chriſt ſhal
appeare, they ſhal receiue an incorruptible
crowne of glory, 1. Pet.</hi> 5. Finally, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of this life, which is for euer, might
make euery eſtate and degree in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
either hie or lowe, to doe moſt cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
their ſeuerall dueties to all men, that
in the ende their parte may bee in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
inheritaunce, which fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
O that our mindes were erected vp
to theſe thinges, they woulde not ſo light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bee carryed away to ſinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
fearing leaſt we ſhoulde leeſe theſe
<pb facs="tcp:10917:186"/>
euerlaſting ioyes. This is the rewarde that
Chriſt hath promiſed to them, that followe
him here, in the regeneration, that haue
for his names ſake forſaken houſes, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
ſiſters, father, mother, wyfe, children
and landes, they ſhall inherite all things,
euen euerlaſting life, Matth. 19. This life
ſhalbe moſt happie and ioyfull, eyther in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the perſons, with whome we ſhall
be, or elſe in reſpect of the place, which is
heauen, the ſeate of God, or in the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the time, which is for euer. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
wee be here many times in a good
place, yet if our company be not good &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
this can be no delite to a godly man.
Nowe in heauen we ſhall haue the glorious
fruition of the Father, the Sonne, &amp; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt, the ſocietie of all the angels, moſt
excellent creatures, the company of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes,
the Prophets, the Apoſtles, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hoſte of Martyrs, briefly the fellowſhip
of all the elect &amp; Saintes of God, that euer
haue bin. This can not be but an vnſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
delite to vs all, when we conſider of it.
Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, we ſhalbe bleſſed in reſpect of the
place, for otherwiſe, if the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany be good, &amp;
yet the place not correſpondent vnto it in al
things, as not being large ynough, or ſweet,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:186"/>
or glorious, there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no great delite there:
but this place is moſt anſwereable to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
wide &amp; large, faire, ſweete &amp; glorious,
euen the heauen of heauens, the ſeate of the
Almighty, a place of ioy, a place of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, a
place of all ſpirituall delectation. S. Iohn
ſeeing it in the ſpirit, hath deſcribed it as far
forth as fleſh &amp; blood can conceaue of it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
earthly things. <hi>I ſawe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a newe
heauen &amp; a new earth, &amp; I ſaw the holy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
new Ieruſalem, come down from God
out of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, prepared as a bride trimmed
for her husband.</hi> Iohn compareth the place
wherein we ſhalbe, to a citie moſt glorious
&amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whoſe ſhining was like to a ſtone
moſt precious, as a Iaſper ſtone, cleare as
Chryſtal, whoſe wal was great &amp; hie, which
had twelue gates, &amp; at the gates twelue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
The wal of the citie had twelue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which were garniſhed with all maner
of precious ſtones, as Iaſpers, Saphires,
Emeraudes, &amp; ſuch like, the building of the
wall is of Iaſper, &amp; the citie was al of pure
golde, like vnto cleare glaſſe. The twelue
gates were twelue pearles, and the ſtreete
of the citie is pure golde, as ſhining glaſſe.
This Citie hath no neede of the ſunne, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the moone to ſhine in it, for the glory
<pb facs="tcp:10917:187"/>
of God did light it, &amp; the Lambe is the light
of it. The gates of it ſhall not bee ſhutte
by day, for there ſhalbe no night there, there
ſhall be no death, no ſorowe, no crying, no
payne, for the firſt things are paſſed. There
ſhalbe a pure riuer of water of life, cleare
as Chriſtall, and the tree of life bearing
twelue maner of fruites. And there ſhall
be no more curſe, but Gods ſeruantes ſhall
raygne there for euermore. This is the
place, which Iohn hath ſhadowed out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, as well as he could vnder theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall
benefites of golde, and ſiluer, and
precious ſtones, whereas in deede it can
not be deſcribed as it is in it ſelfe, becauſe
no man hath ſeene it, and we beyng groſſe
and carnall, muſt haue it by carnall and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
thinges ſet foorth vnto vs. Thirdly,
the excellencie of this life is ſeene in the
continuance of it, in that, that it neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth
or waxeth olde. If here belowe we
had all pleaſures &amp; delites both for the ſoule
and body, yea although the place we were
in, were moſt excellent &amp; glorious, and the
company in al reſpects according to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
good, pleaſant and honeſt: yet if theſe
thinges were but for a dayes, or an houres
continuance, what great contentation of
<pb facs="tcp:10917:187"/>
minde, or recreation for the body might be
here, ſeeing wee muſt depart very ſhortly
from theſe pleaſures? and then it had him as
good, if they had not bene at al. For all theſe
thinges are like vnto pleaſant muſike, in a
ſette of viols, which when they ceaſe once,
(and ceaſe needes muſt euery thing in this
life, be it neuer ſo pleaſant) then it is al one,
as if wee had neuer heard this muſike, ſo
ſweete and delectable to our eares, there is
no print or token of it left behinde, but al va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
away with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very ſtaying of it: <hi>Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as after the flying of a birde in the ayre, or
the paſſing of a ſhip in the ſea, there is no
trace found after them, Wiſ.</hi> 5. But dearely
beloued, beleue me, this life ſhal haue yeres
without ende in vnſpeakeable ioy, in this ſo
excellent a place, we ſhal heare muſike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
and yet it ſhal neuer ceaſe, nor we
be wearie to heare it. And when we haue
bene there in theſe delightes ſo long, and ſo
many thouſande yeeres, as there be eyther
ſandes in the ſea, or graſſes vpon the whole
face of the earth, or ſtarres in the ſkye,
which all are inmunerable to vs: yet then
we ſhal not come out, or leaue theſe ioyes,
but ſtill it is with vs, as if it were to begin.
O the vnſpeakable mercy of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord Ieſus,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:188"/>
that he hath reſerued for thoſe that feare and
loue him here! What man therefore is ſo
fooliſh, ſo madde, ſo beaſtlike in his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
that will not at all be mooued with
theſe pleaſures and ioyes! <hi>For theſe things,</hi>
as the Angel ſayd to Iohn, <hi>are faithfull and
true,</hi> and therefore to be beleeued, and they
that beleeue them not, their parte is in the
lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone,
which is prepared for the vnbeleeuers, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uela.</hi>
21. For from this roote of vnbeleefe,
proceede all the branches of all other ſinnes
&amp; wickednes whatſoeuer, as lying, ſtealing,
couetouſnes, adulterie, and ſuch like. This
life and the dignitie of it, the Prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
in two wordes hath very well expreſſed
in his 16. Pſalme, the latter ende, <hi>Thou
wilt</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>ſhewe me the path of life:
in thy preſence is the fulneſſe of ioye, and
at thy right hande there are pleaſures for
euermore.</hi> Here, in fulneſſe of ioye and
pleaſures for euermore, is all happineſſe
contayned. For theſe ioyes are the greateſt
that may be, and their endurance is for euer.
Conſidering theſe things, ought we not to
ſay with Paul? <hi>I count that the afflictions
of this preſent time, are not worthy of the
glory that ſhalbe ſhewed vnto vs, Rom.</hi> 8.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:188"/>
Why, alas then (dearely beloued) what a
great matter were it, if we ſhoulde endure
here afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s al the dayes of our life, which
can not be aboue an hundred yeeres at the
moſt, ſo we might come in the ende to this
eternall ioye and glory? Paul conſidered
this well, and did ſo doe. <hi>We faynt not,</hi>
(ſayth he) <hi>but though our outwarde man
periſh, yet the inwarde man is renewed
dayly.</hi> Marke well the wordes that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,
and laye them vp in your mindes,
and you ſhall, by the grace of God, profite
thereby. For our light affliction, which is
but for a moment, cauſeth vnto vs a farre
moſt excellent, and an eternall weyght of
glory, whyle we looke not on the thinges
which are ſeene, but on the thinges which
are not ſeene. <hi>For the thinges which are
ſeene, are temporall, but the things which
are not ſeene, are eternall, 2. Corinth.</hi> 4.
Shall we then for an houres pleaſure here
below, leeſe the euerlaſting weyght of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
aboue? God forbid we ſhoulde be ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
and ſo beſotted with this preſent lyfe.
Let this ſaying rather of our Sauiour
Chriſt ſounde continually in your eares:
<hi>What ſhall it profite a man if he winne the
whole worlde, and leeſe his owne ſoule?</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10917:189"/>
And yet wee ſee, howe many men do hazarde
and venture their ſoule, not for the whole
worlde, but for a piece of lande, a litle golde
or ſiluer, or a litle credite or vayne eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this worlde. If the whole earth then
will not bee able to make a recompence or
an exchange to redeeme our ſoules, beyng
once loſt from the fauour of God, howe
much leſſe then ſhall theſe beggerly things,
wherefore we ſtriue ſo earneſtly, be able to
doe it? Nowe although this life be yet as
it were hid from vs, yet it is moſt certaine:
both becauſe we haue a gage of it, which is
the Spirite it ſelfe of Chriſt, and alſo, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it is hid in Chriſt, which will
keepe it well, and is able to giue it to vs
in due time. In the meane ſeaſon, vntill it
be reuealed from heauen, we neede faith to
beleeue it aſſuredly, and hope to wayte for
it with patience, which hope neuer maketh
a man aſhamed, but alwayes comforteth
him euen in the middeſt of troubles of this
life, be they neuer ſo great. For we do well
knowe, that when hee doeth appeare, wee
ſhall be like vnto him, and no man neede to
doubt, but that there is ſuch a life, although
it doeth not yet ſeeme ſo to vs: for there is
a Sunne, when it is compaſſed in with
<pb facs="tcp:10917:189"/>
cloudes, and fire is within the aſhes, when
it appeareth not to our ſight: ſo there is a
life for the godly, although deferred, which
Chriſt hath promiſed and ſpoken of, Matth.
25. that it ſhalbe giuen to his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. This
life euerlaſting, being ſo deare a thing and
precious, the deuill goeth about by all
meanes, to defeate vs of it, and to plucke it
out of our hand. Therfore we muſt lay hold
on it, as Paul willed Timothie, <hi>and fight
the good fight of faith againſt him.</hi> This
is our <hi>crowne which we muſt holde faſt,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
no man bereaue vs of it. For if we miſſe of
life in the end we miſſe of all, and if we haue
this, wee haue and poſſeſſe all thinges, for
all bleſſedneſſe whatſoeuer is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vnder the name of euerlaſting lyfe.
But the beſt comfort for vs is this, that this
life is in the cuſtodie of Ieſus Chriſt, and
wee beyng his ſheepe, no man is able to
plucke vs out of his handes: onely this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth
for vs to looke vnto, that we abide
and continue in his fold. Eternal life being
the euerlaſting inheritance of the kingdom
of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the greateſt treaſure that the Lord
hath to beſtow vpon his ſeruantes, no man
muſt thinke, that it commeth to him for
<pb facs="tcp:10917:190"/>
his good works ſake, or that he doth deſerue
it at Gods hand: this were to preiudice and
ouerthrowe the bountifull goodneſſe of the
Lord. This benefite is the free gift of God,
for although wee deſerue hell and death by
our ſinne and wickednes, yet we merit not
heauen by our good deedes, but as Paul
ſayeth, <hi>Euerlaſting life is the free gift of
God, Rom.</hi> 6. And Chriſt telleth vs, that
<hi>this kingdome was prepared for vs long
agoe, euen before the worlde</hi> was made,
or we borne, ſo that we coulde not ſtep one
foote vnto it of our ſelues, when we were
not, Matth. 25. It is falſe then that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries
of Chriſt, the Papiſtes, haue
taught, that wee may deſerue this life by
our good deedes and workes, when as our
good deedes are not pure in the ſight of the
Lorde. In deede, if our good workes were
eyther perfect, or as many as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth,
or if they were our owne, and
not Gods giftes in vs, or if laſt of all wee
were not bounde of duetie and by right to
doe them, then might wee with our owne
good works deſerue heauen: but our deedes
are vnperfite, they are not our owne, of
duetie muſt we doe them, therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
nothing, as of duetie from the Lorde.
<pb facs="tcp:10917:190"/>
I graunt that euerlaſting life is called by
our Sauiour a <hi>rewarde,</hi> but a rewarde is
not of deſert or merit, but of curteſie. A No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
man may rewarde his tenant for a thing
not woorth a ſhilling, by ſuch a gifte as is
worth twentie ſhillinges: ſhall he therefore
ſaye, that is the poore man, that, becauſe he
hath this rewarde, he hath deſerued it? If he
ſo do, he doth very vnthankfully. When the
ſeruant hath done his duetie, can he clayme
any thing of his maſter by merite? <hi>I trowe
no,</hi> ſayeth our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.
Neyther doeth the maſter thanke him: So
we, if we had done all things commaunded
vnto vs, (as we are farre from performing
the leaſt of them) yet we are vnprofitable
ſeruants: and what doth an vnprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
deſerue at the Lordes handes? Surely
not the kingdome of heauen: if he deſerue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, it is ſtripes. Let vs not therefore
thinke, that we can deſerue ought at Gods
handes, or gratifie and pleaſure him, ſo that
he ſhoulde be beholding to vs, &amp; of duetie to
do any thing for vs. This is a very deuiliſh
opinion. Chriſt hath deſerued at Gods ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
all thinges neceſſarie for vs: therefore if
we be in Chriſt, we ſhall haue all thinges
wee can deſire. The lande of Canaan,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:191"/>
which was but a type &amp; figure of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the
Iewes coulde not get by their owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes,
but only by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> free promes of God,
in mercy made vnto them. It ſeemeth they
had ſome opinion of their own deſeruings,
as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papiſtes haue now, &amp; therefore Moſes
gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times in charge, to attribute al
to the fauour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, &amp; not to their good
works, as appeareth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 7. 8. &amp; 9. of Deut.
but eſpecially in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 9. chap. wheras he ſaith,
<hi>Heare, O Iſrael, thou ſhalt paſſe ouer Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
this day, to go in and poſſeſſe nations
greater &amp; mightier then thy ſelfe, &amp; cities
great and walled vp to heauen. A people
great &amp; tall, euen the children of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kims,
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou knoweſt, &amp; of whom thou
haſt heard ſay, Who can ſtande before the
children of Anak? vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therfore, that
this day the Lord thy God is he, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ouer before thee, as a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuming fire, he
ſhall deſtroy them, &amp; he ſhall bring them
downe before thy face: ſo thou ſhalt caſt
them out, &amp; deſtroy them ſuddenly, as the
Lord hath ſaid vnto thee. Speake not thou
in thy heart, after that the Lorde thy God
hath caſt them out before thee, ſaying, For
my righteouſnes the Lorde hath brought
me in to poſſeſſe this land: but for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes
<pb facs="tcp:10917:191"/>
of theſe nations the Lord hath caſt
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out before thee. For thou entreſt not in
to inherit their land, for thy righteouſnes,
or for thy vpright heart, but for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes
of theſe nations the Lord thy God
doeth caſt them out before thee, &amp; that he
might performe the word which the Lord
thy God ſware vnto thy fathers Abraham,
Iſaac, &amp; Iacob. Vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therfore that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Lorde thy God giueth thee not this good
land to poſſeſſe it, for thy righteouſnes, for
thou art a ſtifnecked people.</hi> Thus you ſee
how in many words y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord throweth down
all their worthineſſe, and extolleth his onely
goodnes towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now if they were not
able to get &amp; purchaſe this te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral land of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
earth: how ſhal we gel heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? &amp; if a man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
not builde an houſe and finiſh it, <hi>except the
Lord builde it, Pſal.</hi> 127. How can any man
buylde an houſe for himſelfe in heauen?
The Iſraelites were taught to ſaye, that
<hi>their abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in meate &amp; drinke, &amp; other
bleſſings of this life, came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lorde, &amp;
not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne power or ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, Deut.
8. verſ.</hi> 17. And ſhall we be ſo iniurious to
God, ſo vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kful to Chriſt, ſo preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuous
againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt, as to ſay, we haue gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to our ſelues euerlaſting life? God forbid
<pb facs="tcp:10917:192"/>
that this fooliſhneſſe ſhoulde enter into the
heart of any man. Seeing then al theſe ſmal
things come not for our owne deſerts vnto
vs, but for his Chriſtes ſake, much more
muſt we aſcribe to his goodneſſe this great
benefite of life euerlaſting. As concerning
this life to come, to aſke, as many do fondly
and curiouſly, rather then godlily, whether
wee ſhall knowe one another, or whether
we ſhal all be alike in degree: I thinke theſe
queſtions to be ſuch as S. Paul <hi>willeth vs
to eſchew &amp; put away farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs.</hi> This is
certaine, our knowledge there ſhall be moſt
perfite and abſolute: for then ſhall I knowe
as I am knowen, and no ignorance of any
thing that is neceſſarie, ſhall be in vs, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man ſhall bee contented, and haue his
full ioye in all meaſure of his quantitie,
ſo that the leaſt pynte potte ſhall be as full
for his meaſure, as the greateſt tunne is
with his quantitie. <hi>All men there ſhall
haue fulneſſe of ioye, Pſalme</hi> 16. The
Lord ſende vs thyther, and we will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with the loweſt roune, as Dauid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
of himſelfe. The beſt queſtion for al to
aſke, eſpecially of the ſimple and vnlearned,
is, to know throughly the way that bringeth
vs thither, which is onely Ieſus Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:192"/>
                     <hi>the way, the trueth, and the life, Iohn</hi> 14.
And ſo dyd our Sauiour anſwere: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
curiouſly demaunded of one, howe
many ſhoulde be ſaued: he tolde him the
meanes howe he ſhoulde be ſaued. And ſo
muſt wee doe alſo, and not feede the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of men, or delite their vaine humors.
I am ſure there bee many men that will
aſke what we ſhall doe in heauen, and what
we ſhall eate and drinke, or whether we ſhal
be clothed there: which can not tell howe
to come thither, if they were demaunded
the queſtion. And what a madneſſe is this,
to ſtriue for the ſhadowe, and to let the body
goe? to enquire to knowe things which we
are not commaunded to ſearch after, and to
let goe thoſe things which we are bound to
knowe? And this vice is moſt common to
them whom we terme fine witted felowes,
which contemne common and neceſſarie
queſtions, to ſeeke out deepe and profound
queſtions, nothing at all tending to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
but rather to the ſubuerſion and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
of all religion and honeſtie. Theſe
men the holy Ghoſt doeth wil vs to auoide,
and ſeeing they are fooles, to anſwere them
with ſilence to their fooliſh queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Theſe
things breede ſtrife and controuerſie about
<pb facs="tcp:10917:193"/>
words, and they are like to that ſerpent
Hidra, which of one idle head, bring foorth a
great manie to deſtruction. Here is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made of hel or of death, becauſe all that
is in this confeſſion of fayth, is ſet downe
for the onely comfort of the godly, and not
for their terrour. Notwithſtanding as there
is a life, and a great rewarde for the godly
after this race is ended: So is there a hell,
and ſeconde, death prepared of olde for the
wicked and reprobate. For our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Chriſt ſpeaking of this life, ſpeaketh
alſo ioyntly of the euerlaſting deſtruction
in fire, which is for the deuill and all his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and thoſe that in this life haue ſerued
him here with their bodies and ſoules, and
all their members. <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſayeth Chriſt)
<hi>ſhall goe into euerlaſting payne, Matt.</hi> 25.
Where Origen and all thoſe that thought
this payne ſhould not be for euer, are moſt
playnely confuted: for Chriſt affirmeth it
to haue no ende. To this ſaying of Chriſt
agreeth that in Eſay the 30. Chapter, verſe
33. <hi>Tophet is prepared of olde, it is euen
prepared for the King, hee hath made it
deepe and large: the burning thereof is
fire and much wood: the breath of the
Lorde like a riuer of brimſtone, doeth
<pb facs="tcp:10917:193"/>
kindle it.</hi> Here is a full deſcription of hell:
For by Tophet he meaneth hell. He decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
moreouer when it was made, euen of
olde, for whom alſo, for the King, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the King of Babylon, enemie to the
Church, ſignifying that God reſpecteth no
mans perſon, but that hell is as well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for Kings and Queenes, for Lords
and Ladies, and for great men, as well as
the poore, that doe not beleeue. Yea, the
greateſt part of men goeth this way, in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
eſtate and degree: ſo that we had neede
to looke about vs, <hi>to enter in at the ſtraight
gate, for fewe there be that finde it, but
many that paſſe by the broade way. Matt.</hi>
7. For this Tophet is deepe &amp; large to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
and to receyue many, yea moe noble
men ſhall go thither then to heauen. The
Prophete deſcribeth the payne of it, by fire
burning with much wood: the continuance
is for euer, becauſe the breath of the Lorde
which endureth for euer, doeth kindle the
fire, as a riuer of brimſtone. The ioyes then
of heauen are not ſo inſpeakable, but that
the torments and pangs of hell are as into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.
Wherefore the wicked, although
they be not moued with the pleaſures at the
right hand of God, to come vnto him by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
<pb facs="tcp:10917:194"/>
yet in my iudgement the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great tormentes of endleſſe hell fire
ſhoulde moue them to amende. For ſurely
(dearely beloued) if all the paynes that
may be deuiſed in this life, all the ſickneſſes
that euer haue bene, all the torments of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
all the griefes of minde that may be,
were all of them layde together, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to this hell fire, theſe paynes howe
great ſoeuer they ſeeme to be here, are but
fleabytings, yea rather pleaſures, in reſpect
of this helliſh fire, it is ſo great. And this
fire although it be ſo great, yet ſhall it burne
for euer and euer, not onely the body, but
alſo the ſoule, the minde, the conſcience, and
all the inner parts of the damned ſort. And
when they haue beene there as many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſande yeeres, as there are peeble
ſtones in the ſea ſhore, yet ſhal they not then
come out, but continue ſtill, as if they were
to beginne anewe. For Chriſts wordes are
true, this <hi>fire is euerlaſting, and can neuer
be quenched, Matthewe 3. &amp;</hi> 25. It were
well with Iudas, if he myght come out of
this wofull hell and paynes, when he hath
ſuffered them ſo many hundred thouſande
millions of yeeres, as there are ſtarres in
the firmament: but this can not be granted
<pb facs="tcp:10917:194"/>
vnto him. If men therefore woulde conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of theſe two extremities, wherein is no
meane: of the ioyes of paradiſe which are
endleſſe, and of the torments of hell and the
wrath of God, which alſo hath no ende: then
ſurely woulde they liue in feare and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in this preſent worlde. For as heauen
is full of ioy and mirth: ſo hell is full of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
and ſorowe: and as in heauen is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
reioycing and peace of minde: ſo is there
in hell a perpetuall weeping, with gnaſhing
of teeth for woe and payne. As the glorie of
the Lorde ſhall inlyghten the elect with his
gratious countenance: ſo ſhall the great
maieſtie &amp; wrath of the Lorde, preſſe downe
the vngodly for euer. Finally, as in heauen
the ſaintes ſhall haue all things to do them
good that they can deſire: ſo in hell the
damned ſpirits ſhal haue nothing to refreſh
them, not ſo much as a droppe of colde wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
(which is but a ſmall thing) to coole
their tongue withall. And as I ſayde before
of heauen and heauenly ioyes, ſo may I
ſpeake of this ſeconde death: that if all the
men in the whole worlde woulde go about
to expreſſe theſe tormentes, with all their
eloquence and learning, yet ſhall they bee
neuer able to doe it: they are ſo vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:10917:195"/>
and not to be vttered of any man. And
theſe are the righteous iudgementes of the
Lord, that he to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked might be knowen
to be a iuſt and a terrible God, to rewarde
impenitent ſinners after their woorkes, as
they haue deſerued. For this ende, ſayeth
the Lorde to Pharao, I haue ſtirred thee
vp, that I myght ſhewe my great power
and myght vpon thee, in puniſhing thee
accordingly. Let the wicked therefore
take heede, for there will come a day that
will pay for all: and then what aduantage
will it be, to haue gotten an houres plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
with the purchaſe of euerlaſting
woes? But theſe things, and theſe euils, by
the benefite of Ieſus Chriſt are farre from
vs, and ſhall not come neere the dwelling
of the righteous. Wherefore wee ought
with Paul <hi>to giue thankes alway to God,
becauſe that from the beginning he hath
choſen vs to ſaluation, through ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſpirite,</hi> and beleefe of the trueth:
neyther hath he appoynted vs to wrath as he
hath the wicked, but to obtaine this euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
life, whereof we ſpeake, by the meanes
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which died for vs,
that whether we ſleepe or wake, we ſhoulde
liue together with him. In the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb facs="tcp:10917:195"/>
it is our part to ſtande faſt, and not to
bee remoued from this faith, but to laye
hande of this eternall life, whereunto wee
through the benefit of the Goſpel preached,
are called freely of GOD, with an holy
calling, not according to our workes, but
of his goodneſſe. Wee muſt alſo fight this
good fight of faith, and ſtriue lawfully: if
we hope to bee crowned, and to continue to
the ende, wee muſt endeuour that wee may
bee ſaued: for they that ſhrinke backe, leeſe
this excellent reward, for the which we are
commaunded <hi>to ſell all that we haue, and
to bye it, Matth.</hi> 13. We haue nowe heard
the meaning of all the twelue articles of
our Chriſtian fayth, which are neceſſarie
to ſaluation: Firſt, wee haue ſeene the
article that concerneth our truſt in God the
Father, &amp; what things we learne by it: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
we haue declared the articles which
conteine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> myſteries of Chriſt Ieſus with
our redemption &amp; glorification, and other
benefits apperteining thereunto. Thirdly,
the beleefe in the holy Ghoſt, the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in Trinitie, hath bene opened vnto vs,
and what comfort may thereof ariſe to the
faithfull: Fourthly and laſtly, the articles
<pb facs="tcp:10917:196"/>
concerning the Church and the benefites
thereto belonging, haue beene expounded
as God hath giuen vs grace. Theſe things
are written, that we might beleeue that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt is the Sonne of God, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
of the world, and that in beleeuing we
myght haue life through this name: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then wee haue hearde theſe thinges,
let vs, as the holy and bleſſed Apoſtle of
Chriſt, Saint Peter, willeth vs, be ready
alwayes to giue an anſwere to euery man
that aſketh vs a reaſon of the fayth and hope
that is in vs, with meekeneſſe and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
And nowe let vs giue thankes as
wee are continually bounde, to our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father, in that it hath pleaſed him to
make vs Chriſtians to beleeue theſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of our fayth, to our great and endleſſe
comfort. And let vs pray vnto him withall
in the name of his welbeloued Sonne,
that he would giue vs grace to growe more
and more euery day in this fayth, that wee
may not onely liue in it, but alſo in the ende
of our dayes, die in it moſt conſtantly,
that ſo wee may bee bleſſed: And that it
woulde pleaſe him to giue this grace, not
only to vs, but to all people &amp; nations of the
earth, eſpecially to his vniuerſall Church,
<pb facs="tcp:10917:196"/>
whereſoeuer it be diſperſed abroade in all
quarters of the earth. And in this Church
let vs pray for the ſtate of all Kinges and
Princes, that wee may liue a godly and
quiet life, with all peace and honeſtie: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
let vs commende to his fauour the
Church of Englande, deſiring him to bleſſe
it as hee hath done theſe many yeeres, and
to continue his holy Goſpel amongſt vs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
wee for our vnthankfulneſſe haue
deſerued to haue it taken away from vs
long agoe. Deſyre wee of him, in mercy
ſtill to beholde his ſeruant and handmaide,
our Queene and ſoueraigne, that ſhee may
bee ſtill zealous to ſet forwarde the Goſpell
of Chriſt, and to roote vp all ſuperſtition
and idolatrie within her realme, that ſhee
may bee wiſe to foreſee and preuent all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
and dangers, that are likely to hang
ouer our heades, that ſo ſhee may haue a
long &amp; a bleſſed reigne ouer vs to his glory,
the profite and commoditie of all her louing
ſubiectes. Let vs likewiſe deſire of God,
to bleſſe all her moſt honourable Counſell
with true godlineſſe and wiſedome from
aboue, that they may boldly, and ſtoutly
miniſter to her maieſtie the beſt aduice, for
<pb facs="tcp:10917:197"/>
the better ouerſeeing and gouernment of
this Chriſtian common wealth wherein
they liue, that all their counſelles and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
may eſpecially bee directed to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God. Pray we him, to bleſſe the
ſtate of the miniſterie of this lande, the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
and Paſtours of his worde, that not
onely in worde, but alſo in good and godly
conuerſation of life, they may beautifie
the glorious Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
we him to roote out from his miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
al rauening wolues, papiſtes, Atheiſtes,
blinde and vnlearned miniſters, and dumme
dogges, which ſeeke onely to fill their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and not to edifie the congregation:
that if it be his will, he would giue to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Church her faithfull and wiſe diſpenſer
of the myſteries of Chriſt. And becauſe the
ſchooles of good learning, are as Nurſes
and well ſpringes thereunto: let vs deſire
Chriſt, to giue his ſpirite amongſt them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in the vniuerſities, that good learning
and godlines may growe, and increaſe day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more and more. Laſtly, for the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of this common weale, let vs pray, that
God would keepe them al in his feare, from
the hieſt to the loweſt, and giue them dueti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:10917:197"/>
and obedient heartes towarde their
prince and magiſtrates, which are by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
ſet ouer them, for their welfare and
happineſſe. Theſe thinges and all other
graces, he onely graunt vnto vs, which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is able and wiſe, and hath immortalitie,
which dwelleth in the light that no man can

our thirſt, ſo doeth his blood refreſh our

the ſpiritual thirſt of our ſoules: and this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of Chriſtes death is not giuen vs

<pb facs="tcp:10917:199"/>
that Ieſus Chriſt is all in all vnto vs, not
only meate to feede vs, Iohn 6. 35. but alſo
drinke to quench our thirſt, as he ſaith, Iohn
7. 37. If any man thirſt, let him come to me
and drinke. And ſo hee is alſo our apparell:
Put you on the Lorde Ieſus, Rom. 13. 14.
The other part of this Supper is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
the remiſſion of ſinnes, and heauenly
graces receiued of vs, as truely as wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the ſignes of them, if wee beleeue: for
this is to confirme our faith in this matter,
that we ſhoulde doubt no more of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
then we doubt whether we haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the viſible ſignes. Nowe for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to this Supper, that wee deceiue not
our ſelues, we muſt haue theſe two things:
firſt, repentance of our former ſinfull life,
to bee ſorie for it which is done, by trying
and examining our ſelues, whether wee bee
heartily ſorowfull or no for our offences: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
we muſt haue faith in Ieſus Chriſt,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yet we deſpaire not for our great ſinnes,
but truſt to haue mercy at his handes when
we cal vpon him, ſo that before we come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this banket, wee muſt prepare our ſelues
to come worthily, reuerently, in faith, hope,
and loue: this is the examination. In recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of it our mindes muſt not bee on the
<pb facs="tcp:10917:199"/>
bread and wine, or vpon any other earthly
thinges, but vpon the body and blood of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt in heauen, ſignified vnto vs by
theſe things belowe. After wee haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
wee muſt giue vnto Chriſte moſt
humble and heartie thankes, for feeding vs
with his body and blood, and meditate and
thinke vpon this continually, &amp; not returne
to our olde life againe. Thus doing, you

                        <p>I beleeue alſo and confeſſe by the holy
ſcriptures an other conception and birth
of Ieſus Chriſt, which is ſpirituall, the
which (I ſay) is of no leſſe dignitye then the

faithfull ought to conceaue into his heart
and ſpirite Ieſus Chriſt, through a trewe
and liuely faith, and to bring him foorth
by open confeſſing of him with his mouth
as often and when ſoeuer it ſhalbe neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
I doe eſteeme this conception, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie
to be ſo neceſſary to ſaluation, that
if the virgin Mary, had not more bleſſedly
borne Ieſus Chriſt in her heart and ſpirit,
then in her belly, her carnall motherhoode

ſet on the right hande of God the father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie,

his owne vnto the worldes ende,
that the power of none aduerſarie can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noye
them without his permiſſion and will.
I beleeue alſo that the Father hath made
him Lorde and ruler ouer all creatures, as
well heauenly as earthly, giuing vnto him
all power ouer heauen and earth, and that
he hath lift him vp aboue all rule, power,
and Lordſhip, and aboue euery name that
is named, not onlie in this worlde, but alſo
in the worlde to come: and hath made all
thinges ſubiect vnder his feete, and hath
appointed him ouer all thinges, to bee the
head of his Church which is his body,
Ephe. 1. 21. And therfore I neither receiue,
neither acknowledge any other Head of the
Church, but onely Ieſus Chriſt, which hath
giuen his blood to waſh away the filthines,
and to heale the woundes thereof, and the
ſame to preſerue, nouriſh, defende and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
by his holy ſpirite. The ſame is the
onely Head and foundation of the Church,
whereon euery one ought to builde accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

that is to ſay, in fleſhe, in body, and

as his body, although it bee glorious, can
not bee in diuers and many places at one

death, decay and deſtruction. For as Chriſt
is and doeth raygne in his Church, euen ſo
Satan is and doeth raygne in, and through
all that are out of that Church: The which
true Church is mayntayned and vpholden
by the Spirite of Chriſt, is ruled and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
by his holy worde, and is nouriſhed
and fedde with his holy Sacraments. That

<pb facs="tcp:10917:222"/>
the thunderings of Antichriſt, and by the
wounds and tempeſt of Satan. For all the

ſhee ſhall not be drowned, but ſhall abide for
euer, becauſe ſhee hath a good defence and

And for this cauſe I cal her y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church

to dwell euerlaſtingly in glory with him &amp;
his Angels: euen ſo the wretched, wicked,
and miſerable damned, ſhal go to hell in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and ſoule, with the deuil and his angels
eternally, to dwel and to be tormented with
him in the fire of hell, which neuer ſhall be
quenched, whereas ſhall be continuall wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
wayling, and gnaſhing of teeth, ſtung

God of his great mercie and
