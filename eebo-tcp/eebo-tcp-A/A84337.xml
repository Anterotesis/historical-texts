         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This you may ſee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 17. So every good tree that is made good by baptiſme into Chriſt, bringeth forth good fruit before God, and a corrupt tree by <hi>Adam</hi> (as all are by generation) brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth evill fruit, <hi>i.</hi> before God. <hi>Calvin</hi> noteth, that this was<note place="margin">Opinion of the <hi>Phariſees.</hi>
               </note> the opinion of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that they were partly good trees, and partly bad, and that they brought forth ſome good fruit before God, and ſome bad, for which they did ſacrifice, as ſome ſay now, they are partly fleſh, and partly ſpirit, and therefore do bring forth ſome fruits good, and ſome bad; and this was the opinion of the old <hi>Phariſees,</hi> for their fained ſanctimony was ſuch, that the people perceived them not. Now Chriſt puts away this vizird, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſeth all Hypocrites, and tels them, that all men are good, or bad before God; a good tree bringeth nothing but good fruit before God, and a bad tree nothing but bad, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 18. for there is

nothing ſuch an enemy to true Chriſtianity, as to counterfeit a man in a twofold eſtate before God; but they do in vain think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves righteous, that are not made good trees by baptiſme into Chriſt, for ſuch juſtifie themſelves before men, and think to make themſelves righteous in whole, or in part, which is the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> but God knows their hearts, <hi>i.</hi> to be evill trees, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 15. Now they bear themſelves in hand, that they were good and righteous men, though they brought forth ſome fruit that was evill before God, they ſhould ſacrifice for that, and take it away well enough, but they were deceived; for <hi>John</hi> telleth them, now baptiſme is inſtituted to waſh away all ſins; now you muſt make the tree good, and the fruit good, <hi>i.</hi> the perſon and the actions all good through the remiſſion of ſins in baptiſme, or the tree evill, and the fruit evill, <hi>i.</hi> the perſon evill by <hi>Adam;</hi> for, <hi>every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit,</hi> i. if it bring forth any evill fruit (before God, now baptiſme is adminiſtred) <hi>it is hewn down, and caſt into the fire of Gods wrath,</hi> Chriſt hath done nothing for them.</p>
            <p>For all men now that baptiſme is adminiſtred, are in <hi>Adam,</hi> or in<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> Chriſt; either they are regenerate of water and the Spirit, or elſe they are not; either they are ingraffed into Chriſt by baptiſme, and made good trees, or elſe they are not ingraffed, but are ſtil in <hi>Adam.</hi> This the Lord ſhewed in a viſion to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> by the two baskets of Figs, the one had exceeding good Figs, even like the firſt, that are<note place="margin">Jerem. 24.</note> firſt ripe, the other had exceeding naughty Figs, they were ſo evill, the Lord in this place, ſaith the Expoſitor, hath reſpect unto the Kingdome of Chriſt, in which both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed by faith and baptiſme, they are made good trees of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall Paradiſe, to bring forth good fruit, and the other that are evill by <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhould have all the curſes and plagues of God to ſeiſe upon them, and be under wrath; <hi>For, thus ſaith the Lord, of the men of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>that have obeyed me, I will know them to be good, but the evill, I will give them for a terrible plague;</hi> So, <hi>now the ax is laid to the root of the trees, every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and caſt into the fire.

Now he that bringeth forth fruit before God, in the Spirit of Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved, otherwiſe he is hewn down, and caſt into the fire.</p>
            <p>What, are none made good trees but thoſe that are graffed and<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> baptized into Chriſt, to bring forth good fruit before God? Was not <hi>Cornelius</hi> his prayer and almes good fruit before God, which came up to God before Baptiſme? <hi>Acts</hi> 10. And what ſay you of Infants dying before Baptiſme?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> did pray in faith, that Chriſt was to<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> come, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did before his coming, which brought forth ſome fruits of faith, that Chriſt ſhould come, and take away their ſins; and they brought forth ſome bad fruits of tranſgreſſion of the Law, as <hi>David,</hi> for which they ſacrificed: Now therefore <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 130. 8.</note> being an elect veſſell, that he might not ſtand in a twofold eſtate before God, to bring forth ſome fruit good, and ſome bad, God ſent an Angel from Heaven to him, and bade him ſend for <hi>Peter,</hi> and he ſhall ſhew thee what thou oughteſt to do, <hi>i.</hi> to be made a good tree, to bring forth nothing but good fruit; ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,<note place="margin">Acts 10. 6,</note> he ſhall ſhew thee by faith, in the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, and by baptiſme into Chriſt, the tree ſhall be made good and fruit good, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 33. For by the Law they were under the heavy yoak, that we nor our fathers were able to beare, which bare ſome good fruits, and ſome curſed, as <hi>Jehoſaphat, 2 Chro.</hi> 19. 2. and <hi>Hezekiah, 2 Chron.</hi> 23. 25.</p>
            <p>Now, if a twofold eſtate had been good enough for <hi>Cornelius,</hi> what needed an Angel be ſent from Heaven, to ſend for <hi>Peter</hi> to bring him into a better eſtate before God then he was in? which ſhews that we have now a better eſtate before God by Baptiſme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, then the Fathers had under the Law, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God providing a better thing for us,</hi> Heb. 11. 40. we have a

            <p>And concerning Infants dying before Baptiſme, if either of the parents be faithfull, they are ſaid to be holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. that is, within the holy covenant of Baptiſme: for Baptiſme is the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of the Ark; that as <hi>Noah</hi> prepared the Ark, not only to ſave himſelf, but alſo his houſhold; ſo the ſame ſigne which now ſaveth<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 22.</note> us, baptiſme, I mean the inward Baptiſme, is received to ſave a mans ſelf and his houſhold, that die before they can come unto it, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> told the Jaylor, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thy houſhold,</hi> Acts 16. which he could not do without baptiſme; and therefore it is ſaid, that when he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,<note place="margin">Acts 16. 34.</note> he rejoyced that he and his houſhold believed in God; for no man can believe in Chriſt before he be baptized into him; for if he ſhould ſay, he believes he is in Chriſt, he ſhould believe a lie, for no man can truly ſay he is in Chriſt, before he is baptized into him; and this cauſed <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Junius</hi> his couſins, and fellow-priſoners, that were notable among the Apoſtles, and were in Chriſt before me, <hi>i.</hi> they were baptized before me, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors and believers before me, they were ingraffed into Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, when I was without Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. and a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer.</p>
            <p>If all be done in Baptiſme, that men be made good trees to bring<note place="margin">Ob.</note> forth none but good fruit, and have perfect remiſſion of all ſins, and an everlaſting righteouſneſſe freely, what need men repent, or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie ſin, or pray for remiſſion?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, though God hath ſealed ſuch a free covenant with us<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> on his part, yet we cannot know it, untill we repent, and believe, and mortifie ſin, and pray for remiſſion; for theſe are to us-ward ſignes, that the covenant of Grace was ſealed upon us in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme to God-ward; as that we were made ſo to himſelf, a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Church, not having ſpot, to be holy, and without blame, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 26.

by the inward joyes, that he received the Holy Ghoſt in Baptiſme.

            <p>What? Are the elect juſtified in Baptiſme before God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> the Holy Ghoſt there, and are made Temples for the Holy Ghoſt to dwell in? How can we believe this, when we ſee many live looſly, and walk in all kinde of ſins, a long time after? I will not believe it, except I could ſee ſome workings of the Holy Ghoſt in them.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, thou art a faithleſſe <hi>Thomas</hi> that would not believe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> he might ſee and feel; did not Chriſt ſay to him, and ſo to thee, <hi>Be not faithleſſe, but believing; bleſſed is he that believeth, and hath not ſeen.</hi> The Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was made you know for an holy houſe of prayer, but if you had gone in Chriſts time, you might have ſeen, that they had brought in Oxen, and Sheep, and there was tables of the money-changers, and ſeats of them that ſold Doves, and ſuch a multitude of buyers, and ſellers, that they had made the Temple of God a Den of thieves, but they did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temple it, but it was a Temple ſtill; but Chriſt made a ſcourge of ſmall cords, and drove all the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple: So the elect by Baptiſme, are made the Temple of God; <hi>for the Temple of God is holy, which are ye,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 17. and they buy and ſell Oxen, and Sheep, and Doves, and bring in the tables of money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers, covetouſneſſe and uſury, and make the conſcience a Den<note place="margin">As <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts.</hi>

            <p>Is it ſo, Chriſt is a Vine, and are we the branches? and how were<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> you made branches, but by Baptiſme? look you bring not forth evill fruit before God, for he that bringeth not forth fruit in Chriſt, but evill fruit of ſin, God taketh it away, cuts it off, it withers in faith, and men gather them together, and they burn, ſuch are hewn down, and caſt into the fire.</p>
            <p>Are we members of his body, fleſh and bones? For he can ſay<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> as <hi>Adam</hi> did to <hi>Evab,</hi> and ſo may we ſay, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 30. Then are any of Chriſts members in a twofold eſtate before God; partly <hi>Adam,</hi> and partly Chriſt; what do any of Chriſts members, hands, feet, legs, arms, fingers, toes, bring forth good fruit, and bad too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God? no, all Chriſts members are good trees, and a good tree cannot bring forth bad fruit before God: here is comfort for thee, if thou abide in this faith, no man ſhall take thy joy from thee; many loſe their joy, by believing they are in a twofold eſtate before God.</p>
            <p>Again, are you members of Chriſt by Baptiſme? where is your love to the members of Chriſt, that are baptized into Chriſt, as well as you? Here is the reaſon of all the ſects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diviſions, and wars in Chriſtendome, and no more love, becauſe they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten their Baptiſme: as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. they have forgotten they are members of Chriſt, and children of God, and inheritors of the Kingdome of heaven; they ſay not, why do we wrong one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, for we are brethren? they have forgotten they were waſhed<note place="margin">Acts 7.</note> from their ſins, (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) and therefore, if they have not put off the old man, muſt needs live in old hatred, malice, envie and lying; wherefore labour to bring all men to the faith of their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, that in it they were made members of Chriſt; for this faith would teach them to ſay, Should one hand fight with another?
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:113429:24"/>
though the children of the Devill fight, and could never agree, ſhould not the members of Chriſt love one another? <hi>O quam ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum eſt, ut ii diſſideant in terris, qui in omnem aeternitatem una victuri ſunt in coelis!</hi> O! how unfit is it, for thoſe to diſagree, fight, and hate one another on earth, which ſhall live together for ever in heaven? So that he that forgets his baptiſme, <hi>i.</hi> his waſhing from his old ſins, <hi>i.</hi> from originall and actuall ſins, that man cannot make his calling and election ſure, that hath forgot his Baptiſme, for he hath forgot the true faith, <hi>i.</hi> that he is in him that<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 20.</note> is true, and he hath forgot to adde to faith vertue, <hi>i.</hi> of Chriſts death and reſurrection, and he hath forgot to adde to vertue, knowledge, <hi>i.</hi> of ſalvation, by the remiſſion of ſins, which was in baptiſme; and he hath forgot to adde to knowledge, temperance, for want of the knowledge of ſalvation by remiſſion of ſin, cauſe men to fall to intemperance; and he hath forgot to adde to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, patience, and thus they wrangle and fight with his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members; and he hath forgot to adde brotherly kindneſſe; he believes not his own ſins are forgiven; he forgives not his brother, and he addes not love, for he hath forgot Chriſt hath loved him, and waſhed him from his ſins in his own blood, he covers not a multitude of offences in his brother; ſo that you ſee, the forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a mans Baptiſme into Chriſt, is the cauſe of all the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſects, wars, and miſchieves that are in the world, and of the damnation of ſo many thouſands; for he that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that will not believe his baptiſme into Chriſt, ſhall be damned; for he cannot believe he is in Chriſt, or hath remiſſion of ſins, or an everlaſting righteouſneſſe, for he that will not believe he is baptized into Chriſt, and hath put on Chriſt, ſhall be damned, if he never will be baptized.</p>
            <p>What, Do you hold that Baptiſme do conferre grace <hi>ex opere operato?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer no; for then all the reprobate that are baptized, ſhould receive grace at it, but <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did not. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all the elect do ordinarily receive grace at baptiſme, as many Scriptures, Fathers and Churches declare, <hi>Acts 2. 38. Joh. 3. 5. Gal. 3. 27. Tit.</hi> 3. 5. And <hi>Cyprian, Gregory Nazianzen, Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Chryſoſtom, Baſil, Jerome, Ambroſe, Auguſtine, Luther, Calvin, Beza, Bucer, Zanche, Mourton, Marlorat, Hooker:</hi> the confeſſion of

               <hi>Helvetia</hi> of <hi>Scotland, Belgick, France, Argentine, Auguſtan, Saxon, Wittenberg, Palatine,</hi> and our Church of <hi>England;</hi> in all which ten Churches, the groſſe and damnable hereſie of the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> is condemned; and of all ſuch as hold that grace is not given to the elect Infants at baptiſme. And here is the reaſon, when the <hi>Jews</hi> are called, they ſhall never ſcatter more into ſundrie opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſects, and fight one with another, becauſe they ſhall be ſo ſoundly grounded on the faith of their baptiſme into Chriſt, that they are in him that is true, and ſo are members and children of God, that they ſhall love one another ſo in Chriſt, as they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fight one with another more; and then ſhall the ſeventh Vial be powred out on the air, which is the kingdome of the Devill; for he ſhall never have any power to ſet them together by the ears, as he doth now: <hi>Heathens</hi> againſt <hi>Heathens, Turks</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſtians, Papiſts</hi> againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> one with another; for herein conſiſts the ſubtilty of the Devill and the Pope, to ſet <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> together by the ears, that he may get both; for he gets more by their killing one another, then by any other way, but after that the ſeventh Vial be powred out on the kingdome of the Devill, by the preaching of Baptiſme, and Faith that we are in him that is true, the Devill ſhall never have any power to ſet them at variance any more, for all the true Church ſhall by the faith of their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme into Chriſt, believe they are members, and love as brethren, and then the Propheſie of <hi>Micah,</hi> Mic. 4. 2, 3. for the Law <hi>Thorah,</hi> ſignifies in generall, doctrine, and ſo may be taken for Baptiſme, as <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme was from heaven, ſhall go forth of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the word of the Lord from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> i. that men are clean by the word that Chriſt hath ſpoken in Baptiſme: And he ſhall judge among many people, and rebuke mighty nations a far off of ſin, of righteouſneſſe, and of judgement, <hi>John</hi> 16. becauſe they believe not in Chriſt that believe not their baptiſme, he ſhall bring them to it, and then they ſhall break their ſwords into mattocks, and their ſpears into ſithes, nation ſhall not lift up a ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn to fight any more, but they ſhall ſit every man under his vine, and under his fig-tree, and none ſhall make them afraid, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it, <hi>i.</hi> between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which ſhall be truly graffed into Chriſt by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, there ſhall be no diſſention, as there is now under the corrupt

ſtate of the Church, for under that pure ſtate of the Church, they ſhall ſtrive to ſhew all offices of love, as they do now practices of hatred, which is not ſo to be underſtood, as if it were not lawfull now for <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to take up arms, as the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> have held ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly, for ſo long as Antichriſt fight againſt Chriſt, they muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend<note place="margin">See <hi>Brightman</hi> on that place.</note> themſelves againſt him; for the Church is terrible, as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie with banners, ſhe muſt fight: But in the elect juſtified Church by baptiſme into Chriſt, and faith in the ſame, among the right Olive branch, <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhall ſhow ſuch love, peace and concord, that they ſhall fight no more; there is ſuch love already to be ſeen among the white-raiment <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that they had rather die then fight one againſt another. And this is for the comfort of you the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that are no <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> nor <hi>Antinomians,</hi> though the world may falſly call you by ſome groſſe name, for you hold the Law is to be preached in the killingeſt manner that can be; and believe your baptiſme in infancy, and are ſound in the faith of your baptiſme, you are the people that God will deliver in this bloody civill war: For thus ſaith the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my patience, therefore I will deliver thee from the hour of temptation, which will come upon all the world, to try them that dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth.</hi> Now the word of Chriſts patience, is the true faith in our<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 10.</note> baptiſme, wherein we are baptized into Chriſt his death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. and buried with him, and crucified with him, and raiſed with him; for the word of Chriſts patience is the faith of Chriſt crucified (as <hi>Meyer</hi>) dead and buried, and riſen again, which are all included in the faith of our baptiſme, that we are in him crucified, dead and buried to ſin before God in him, and riſen again in him by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, which belongs not only to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> but to all other Churches, that hear what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches, <hi>I will deliver thee from the hour of temptation,</hi> i. from the laſt perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Antichriſt, which is now come upon all the Chriſtian world, in theſe our dayes, which is like to laſt till the Pope be deſtroyed.<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Are we made good trees by putting on of Chriſt as a garment? for if a man had ſuch a garment as would make all his thoughts, words and actions good, it would make him a good tree. Now Chriſt is ſuch a garment of righteouſneſs, that is put on at baptiſm, and by faith, that it makes the tree good, and the fruit good: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, Chriſt is come as a thief, and the laſt perſecution of Antichriſt

            <p>Again, are men made good trees by baptiſme and faith, becauſe<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> they are made to drink into one Spirit? Then the way to bring all men to be of one Religion, and to ceaſe all wars in Chriſtendome, is to teach them, how they have all received one Spirit in Baptiſme, and baptized into one body, that is, a loving Spirit, a peaceable,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note> meek, and quiet Spirit, that takes of Chriſts water, and ſhews unto us, and of Chriſts blood, and ſhews unto us, and of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and ſhews unto us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 14. But haſt thou an hatefull ſpirit, a wrangling, angry fighting ſpirit, that do not take of Chriſts water, but of the Popes holy-water, and ſhew to thee, not of Chriſts blood, and ſhews unto thee, for remiſſion of ſins, but of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Frances</hi> his blood, or ſome works of man for remiſſion of ſins, or not Chriſts righteouſneſſe in Baptiſme, but mans righteouſneſſe, and ſhew unto thee, this is not the Spirit of Chriſt that the Saints are made to drink into at baptiſme, but thou haſt forgot thy baptiſme, and ſo loſt the Spirit of Chriſt; for as the Spirit of God moved upon the waters, <hi>i.</hi> as it were, hatching and nouriſhing the cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
