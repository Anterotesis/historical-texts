            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

foorth any thing to be seene and read of others, to
set downe some reasons that mooued them to take
such pains, and to publish their labors. In the yeere
of our Lord, one thousand, fiue hundred, eightie
two, a testament tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated into English, at Rhemes
in France, was published in print, by the English fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue
Papists resiant there. The censure, view, and
examination whereof, hath euer since been hartily
looked, or rather longed for, of all both rich and
poore, high and low, that feare God and loue his truth. But by what occasion I
cannot tell, it hath been hitherto delaied. Whereupon I thought it would not
be amisse, neither misliked, if some thing in the meane space might be done,
toward the satisfaction of the well affected, and the repressing of the triumphes
of the contrarie. Therefore at my returne from London, from Michaelmasse
terme last past, I tooke in hand to discouer the loose, corrupt, vniust, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
dealing of our Rhemists in their marginall notes. Which if I could effect,
and bring to passe afore an answer to their whole worke came foorth, I did sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that it would somwhat diminish the griefe of manie good men, and make
them the more patiently to expect and wait for the censure of the whole work.
And againe, if it should happen, that by reason I tooke it in hand so late, that I
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould not compasse it, or bring it to passe, afore the censure of the whole worke
were in presse, yet I did thinke, that bicause that worke could not be but verie
great, and therfore chargeable; that it would not be thought amisse of, if some
part were answered by it selfe, which the poorer, and those which either were
vnable, or vnwilling to be at charges with the other, might attaine and haue
with small cost. Now hauing by the fauor of God gone through it, I thought
that I could not choose a better patron for it, than your Grace, whom God
hath aduanced to the highest Ecclesiasticall place and dignitie in our Church
of England. For some make the dedication of their works, testimonies of old
friendship and familiaritie, and as it were monuments of their old long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
loue. Which cause if there were no more, were sufficient, considering the
loue, wherewith you haue imbraced me these thirtie yeeres and vpwards. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
do it to witnes their mindfulnes of their dutie to them that be in hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
place and calling. And why should not I heerin also imitate them, sith it
hath pleased God, leauing me in a meane place, so highly to aduance you? O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to get the fau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>able patronage and defence of their works by high dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
and authoritie, against all maleuolous cauillers and backbiters, whereof
this wicked world is alwaies full. And heer of both I stand in great need, hauing
the whole band of Popish sophisters in this against me, and also none can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
protect and defend me, than you, either for learning and iudgement, or for
<pb facs="tcp:20995:3"/>
power and authoritie, wherewith God hath indued you. Their whole worke
consisteth altogither of lieng, fraud, and deceit, which I thought not vnmeete
in some part to touch, disclose, and make manifest in this mine Epistle. First in
their Preface, then in their Translation, after in their collected and concluded
Annotations: lastly, in their thicke and threefold allegations of the fathers.
In which I will vse all possible breuitie and shortnes; for that my purpose is but
to giue a little small taste of their foule and shamelesse dealings, whereby the
sinceritie of their dealing in the rest may be the easilier and better gessed at.
The first part of their Preface maintaineth against the whole course of the
Scriptures, and against all authoritie of the ancient primitiue Church, that it
is not necessarie for al Christians to haue, and read the Scriptures in a knowen
vulgar toong.<note place="margin">Deut. 6. vers. 7. 8 9.</note> Which if it were true, why are all men commanded continually

Hierome commendeth poore plough men, bicause at the plough taile in their
worke and labor, they could sing the Psalmes. Our Rhemists adde of their owne
(beleeue them if you list) to salue the matter withall, that they sang in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
they vnderstood not, and wherein they could not read those Scriptures.
Saint Chrysostome exhorted the common people to get them Bibles,<note place="margin">In the homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quoted in their epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.</note> and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments,
and refuted the same obiections, which the Papists at this day make
to the contrary. But our Papists tel vs that he dealt like a pulpit man, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his rules must not be generall, but serue for his owne people, which he
preached vnto. As who should say the pulpit were not as meet a place, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
the rules of religion, and a generall truth in, as the schooles. They adde,
that euery artificer dealeth in the hardest, and deepest matters of religion,
omitting the more easie, that they presuppose no difficulties, that they aske
for no expositor, that they feele no depth of Gods science in Scripture, that
maners, and life are nothing amended, that priuate fantasies, and not the
sense of the Church, and doctors thereof, in interpreting the Scriptures is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
And whosoeuer knoweth the state, and condition of the Church of
England, knoweth all this to be an beape, and dunghill of lies packed togither.
If their commendation of their Churches moderation, in not wholy condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

                  </gap>.</note> and such other like of their side, haue abused vs, in telling vs, that the
malepartnesse of Heretikes made the Church altogither to forbid the vulgar
translations. Their accusations of our translations, haue alreadie been so well
answered by Master Doctor Fulke to Martinius, that I neede not to touch
them. Their reasons likewise being both many, and friuolous, whereby they go
about to prefer their vulgar latin version, before the text in the toongs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were first written, I leaue to him, or them, which shall answere the whole
preface in order as it lieth: onely three things, I will admonish men to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of, in them. First that they tend not so much to giue credit to the vulgar
<pb facs="tcp:20995:3"/>
text, as to discredit al texts whatsoeuer, to the end that either men might haue
nothing to ground their religion certainlie on, or else to make their Church
of Rome their only stay. Secondly, that they confesse the Fathers in this point
to be against them, namely whose opinions are that the Latin text should
yeeld to the Greeke, and Hebrue: but they thinke to avoid it with a slie shift,
that they meant the true, and vncorrupted text, as it was in their daies, and
times. But Lodouicus Viues a learned man, liuing in the daies of Henrie the
eight, in his annotations vpon Saint Augustine <hi>de ciuitate Dei,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iib. 14. cap. 8.</note> telleth vs, that to
his time (a fewe vnlearned dolts excepted) all men preferred the texts in
their original toongs,<note place="margin">Lib. 15. cap. 13.</note> before the others translated out of them. Therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our good Masters of Rhemes must tell vs of some great corruptions that
haue crept in of late yeeres into the Greeke, and Hebrew texts, or else they
can not blame vs for not crediting them against the learned of all ages afore
vs, old and new, one, and others. Thirdly, that the Councel of Trent goeth not
so far as our new Masters of Rhemes: For they preferre it onely before all La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
translations, making it amongst them the onely autenticall texte: In which
it is plaine that either the Pope, or the Councell might, and did erre. For Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
dedicated his translation to Pope Leo, and vnder his approbation manie
men tooke it for autenticall, and now your Councell iudgeth it not autenticall,
therefore either Leo, or they iudged amisse, take whether they will. Thus much
for their Preface. Their Translation (how much soeuer they brag of paines,
care, and conscience to deale sincerely) is fraudulently framed to make poore
men thinke the Scriptures to be more obscure and darke a great deale, than
they are, and so to fray them (as much as in them lieth) from taking paines to
read them. I note this onely, not bicause it is not full of other corruptions, and
partialities, but bicause leauing them to the censurer, or censurers therof, I
take that which euery blind man may see, that they haue studied therin for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
lesse, than perspicuitie, &amp; plainnes. For they haue both hunted for words
of purpose, which the people do not vnderstand, as superstantiall, didrachmes,
cense, stater, scandall, scandalized, Corbanah, euangelized, scenopegia, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclete,<note place="margin">Iohn 2. v. 4.</note>

they are, though it will sufficiently appeare in mine answeres to their
marginal notes; yet I hope it wil not be amisse, if some also be noted down here.
These shall be of two sorts, one so grosse that euery simple man may see the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of their collections: the other more cunninglie, but yet deceitfully ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.
The deceit of the later sort is also double, either grounded vpon wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and slaunderous misreporting of our assertions, or else vpon aequiuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and ambiguitie of words, wherewith it seemeth they delight them selues
greatly, and thinke it a wonderfull peece of learning to deceiue their poore,
simple &amp; credulous followers. The first sort void of all shew of probable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
are throughout their Testament very many. But to auoide tediousnes,
I will content me here with a very few.<note place="margin">Vers. 23.</note> In the first of Matthew. Our Sauiour
Christ borne in mariage, yet of a Virgin, honoreth both states, and withall
teacheth vs that virginitie, and continent life are preferred before mariage.
In the second of Matthew vpon the murdering of the children,<note place="margin">Vers. 16.</note> by this we learn,
<pb facs="tcp:20995:4"/>
what credit is to be giuen to the Church in canonizing Saints, and celebrating

Matthew vpon these words, except your iustice do abound, &amp;c. whereby we see
(say they) saluation, life and iustification not to come of onely faith, or impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Christs righteousnes.<note place="margin">Vers. 13.</note> In the sixt chapter, vpon these words, Leade vs

                  </gap>.</note> In the seauenth chapter vpon these words, Lord, Lord. These
men haue faith, otherwise they could not inuocate, therefore to beleeue is not
enough. I could haue drawne out a great number as bad, or woorse than these,
but I will heere stay. For I haue giuen a sufficient taste, what might be done in
the most part of their Testament, almost in euerie chapter. Now concerning
their double deceit afore spoken of, whereof the first is grounded vpon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
which blindeth them, and maketh them wilfully against their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and knowledge to mistake and misreport our assertions. One common
cauill, is the finding fault with our translating of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">

and to repent, and amend, Mathew. 11. and repeated in many other
places, which is grounded vpon this slander, that bicause we do not allow
that the fruits of repentance be works satisfactorie for sinne, therefore we do
not teach at al those testimonies of harty, and vnfeined repentance. Another
cauill very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon also riseth vpon that, bicause we confesse (as the holy Ghost
hath taught vs in the Scriptures) that God is the author of euerie act, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they gather also that he is the author of euerie sinne, or euill. Which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
collection, though it haue been ten thousand times answered, and
that fully, yet they cease not still odiouslie to obiect it. And bicause we denie
that Christ after his death went into Limbus Patrum,<note place="margin">Actes 2. vers. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>7.</note> as they without al war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the word imagine, therefore they maliciouslie giue out that Caluin
and his followers denie an article of the Faith,<note place="margin">1. Peter. 3. ver. 19.</note> and therfore conclude them to
be infidels. In all their notes touching iustification by faith, they deale with
vs, as though we ascribed iustification to an idle faith, which worketh not by
loue, and vpon that false ground, they gather many things against vs, as shall
appeere in mine answere to their notes. But all that are wise, and haue eies to
see, do perceiue, that in this maner of dealing, they do but vtter their owne
shame, in making no conscience of cogging, lieng, and slaundering, &amp; in steede
of battailing with their enimies, they make themselues sport with their owne
shadowes. Now to their amphibologies, and aequiuocations; which are also to
long to pursue. The Rhemists vpon the fift to the Galathians confesse, that
Paule when he ascribeth iustification to faith, speaketh of such a faith as work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by charitie, and yet in all their notes against iustification by faith, they
dallie, and play, and dazel the eies of the simple with the ambiguitie of the
word, being diuerslie in diuerse places taken. The like dealing they vse about
the words of iustice, and iustification, which when they know them to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly
taken, and in sundry senses, yet they delude with the sound of the words
those, who for simplicitie are not able to discerne the diuersitie of the sense. I
<pb facs="tcp:20995:4"/>
wil not heap vp here more of these examples, a number will offer themselues
in reading of mine answers. The alledging of the Fathers thicke and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde,
is for two fraudulent respects. One is, that those which are doubtfull to
what religion they may encline, and to which side to cleaue, may continue
doubtfull, and without resolution still, whiles both our aduersaries, and we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Fathers, and accuse one another of corrupt dealing in them, and they
poore soules not able to repaire to the Fathers to see whether side dealeth
truely. The second is to continue the false perswasion of their credulous follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
in thinking that all antiquitie maketh for poperie. To these two ends it
is, that their allegations are so many. First therefore to auoid this their fraud,
it is to be noted, and obserued, that a maruellous number of their allegations,
touch no point, nor matter in controuersie betwixt vs. As for example,<note place="margin">Mat. 2. ver. 16.</note> they
alledge Origen to prooue that the innocent children murthred by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of Herode,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. ver. 10.</note> haue beene honored for martyres. Augustine to
prooue that not to do good is damnable.<note place="margin">Mat. 3. vers. 8.</note> Hierome to prooue that fasting,
praier, and almes are fruits of repentance, or as they terme it, penance, Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to prooue that they are false martyrs,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. ver. 10.</note> that suffer not for iustice. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
to prooue that by the church the gouernors thereof be vnderstoode.<note place="margin">Mat. 18. vers. 17.</note>
Ambrose to prooue that God hath left to his church authoritie aswel to loose,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. vers. 18.</note>
as to binde. Which kinde of proofes for matter not denied, if they had beene
omitted, and left out, the great glorious shew of Fathers had beene blemished,
and their campe verie nigh halfe dissolued. Next is to be marked, that if they
catch any thing that maketh for them in any Father, they neuer looke how
rightly the Father collecteth it, and by what good reason he warranteth it, it
is with them sufficient that he saith it.<note place="margin">August. epist. 19.</note> But Augustine teacheth vs to giue that
reuerence onely to the canonical Scriptures, to beleeue. whatsoeuer they say.
And for others of what learning or holines soeuer, not to beleeue bicause they
speake, but bicause they prooue that which they speake, either by the word it
selfe, or by good reason grounded vpon the same word. And here also bicause
they are woont to triumph that we make this a colour to reiect the Fathers,
when they make against vs, it is to be remembred that they themselues do not
without exception admit the Fathers.<note place="margin">Hos. de side &amp; symbolo ca. 19.</note> But they appoint an other rule to trie
them, and their saiengs by, that is, the decrees, and determinations of their
owne church. Thirdly it is to be noted that they alledge those bookes very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
wherin they know that the Father which wrote them, was far ouercarried
with heate of contencion, that they themselues will not, nor dare not defend
many things that passed them, as Hieroms bookes against Iouiuian, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantius.
Fourthly it is not to be passed ouer, how they abuse Augustine in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
those bookes which he wrote against the heretike Pelagius,<note place="margin">Retract. lib. 1. cap. 23.</note> concerning
the question of Freewill, and alledging testimonies out of other books, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he himselfe did confesse, that he did erre of ignorance. Fiftly they force di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
and sundrie to serue their turnes, whether they will, or no. Sixtly to make
the greater shew, they furnish out their number with such as they know to
haue beene burnt on the face for forgerie, and cite them vnder the reuerend
names of Clemens, and Dionisius Areopagita, and such like. Finally it is not
to be passed ouer, that they for the corroborating, and proouing of the vsurped
primacie of the bishop of Rome, they hunt for speeches of the Fathers spoken
in extolling Peter, or in commending the faith, then professed at Rome, or els
the excellent learning, and vertue of some notable bishops there, which then
<pb facs="tcp:20995:5"/>
gouerned that church, and them they racke, and set on the tenters to prooue
that, which they neuer thought of, that is, the vniuersall power, and authority,
which the bishop of Rome now claimeth. The practise of the primitiue church
doth best declare, both what the Fathers ment, and also what power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
he had. In that it is manifest that he was a bishop as other bishops,<note place="margin">Hieronimu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nothing of anie weight, in anie matter of controuersie, but it hath beene (and
that they know well enough) often, and fullie answered by diuers, and sundrie
alreadie? But bicause being fugitiues, and hauing no honest ordinarie vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to occupie themselues about, they neuer make an end of writing, wherein
they do nothing but set new colours on old matters, to make their sencelesse
followers beleeue, that they bring in new allegations, neuer before answered:
Therefore (vnder your Graces correction be it vttered) I would wish that our
controuersies being drawen into a sum, might by your authoritie be deuided,

for that purpose, to examine, and to reduce and bring into the best frame
and forme they can, all the arguments of the aduersaries, and to ech seuerall
argument the answere, as plainely and briefly as it can be comprised, which
being done, and compiled into one, or two volumes, whatsoeuer they write
hereafter, except they bring (which I thinke impossible) some newe thing
heretofore vnheard of, to be referred to those volumes for answer, and so to
cease troubling the world with more bookes. Touching mine answers to their
marginall notes (I hope it will appeere) that I haue studied with as much bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie,
and plainnes as I could possibly, to discipher their vanitie, and trifling,
wherewith they haue blotted, and blurred their margents of their Testament.
Their translation, and larger annotations, though many times great occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are offered to carpe at them, yet as neere as I could possiblie, I haue left
them vntouched, to him, or them (whosoeuer he or they be) that of purpose
shall deale with that matter. To the end that my truth, and simplicitie of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
may the better appeere to the Reader, of what sort soeuer he be, I haue set
downe the text, wherevpon their notes are gathered, according to their owne
translation, and their notes, word, forword, and then mine answers. By which
doing, I hope it will well appeere, that when out of their most partiall transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which they of purpose haue framed for their best aduantage, the things
which they gather, will not follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor be confirmed: that they are vtterlie
destitute of all helpe of the scriptures, how soeuer they labor to wring them to
their purpose. But concerning mine owne doing this shall suffice. If this which
I haue done, shall by you (most reuerend father) be iudged to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
for the church and people of God, I haue that
which I desire. The Lord God blesse, keepe,

do testifie to them, that the best ground they haue for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such trées, as papists may be, is the corrupt motions of their
owne will, and choise. But we know that no man commeth to
Christ,<note place="margin">Iohn 10. 29.</note> but whom the father draweth,<note place="margin">Iohn 15. 16.</note> and he hath no shéepe but
those whom his father hath giuen him, and of them he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
they make not choise of him, but he of them. As for Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
he wrote scant aduisedly of fréewill, till Pelagius did awake
him.<note place="margin">Retract. pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, cap. 23.</note> For till then as he himselfe confesseth, he had not diligently
sought nor yet found, what the election of grace ment. Therefore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20995:9"/>
in the matter of fréewill, if you bring any thing, that Augustine
wrote afore he wrote against Pelagius, you do but abuse men
with his name against his minde, which in this shall appéere
thus. The question betwéen the Manichées and Augustine was,
what was the originall cause of euil? The Manichean maketh
two eternall, incommutable natures, one good, the other euill,
one the author of good, the other the author of euill. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
part, Augustine maketh freewill the originall cause of euil.
The Manichean amongst other scriptures, wrested to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to prooue his two natures, vseth this of the two trées good
and bad. Augustine to take away his application of this text an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth,
that it was the wil of man that made him a bad tree, and
that it was in his choise whether he would be good, or bad. After
this ariseth Pelagius, of whom the papists haue learned their
freewill: he for his defence catcheth at spéeches vsed by Augustine
against the Manicheans. Augustine replieth, that though some
spéeches vsed against the Manicheans might séeme to fauor the
error of fréewill, yet other spéeches of his, euen in those his books
against the Manicheans, will sufficiently cleere him from any
such meaning,<note place="margin">De natura &amp; gratia cap. 67.</note> and therefore giueth men this rule, that that,
which in those bookes, and in that question he spake of will to do
well, he spake of the will of man in which man was first created,<note place="margin">Retract. lib. 1. cap. 9.</note>
and not otherwise. Thus we sée that our Rhemists learned this
of their captaine Pelagius; and that they go about by Augustine
to prooue that which he ment not, that is, the freedome of our
wils now.</p>

pertaine. And also we saie that this is a friuolous collection,

can iustly be gathered out of this parable but that the Iewes,

Which collection is tied to this place with points. For though

                  <p>The case was manifest. And so was that of Henrie the eight,
who maried his brothers wife, when he was dead, but not to stir
vp issue to his brother. Which mariage was condemned for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful

                  <p>And why haue we not here one doctor to say for you, that
Drinke yée all, is not so general a commandement, as Take and
eate? Can that be a catholike exposition, which is contrarie to all
expositions of catholike expositors for many hundred yéeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Christ? Take and eate stretcheth to laie men, as the practise
of your church doth shew. And, Drinke yée all, that must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streined
to priests, bicause no more but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles were present.
And if that cause be of force, why shall it not restraine the other
commandement also, Take and eate to priests onely? But the
holy Ghost foreséeing what popish corruptions the diuell would
bring into the Church, did afore hand (the more fully to preuent
the diuels fraud héerein) direct the pens of the Euangelists in the
giuing of the cup, to expresse the vniuersall signe, all, where in
deliuerie of the bread, he is content with an indefinite spéech, take
and eate. Heere all antiquitie is vtterly against poperie. Their
doctrine of concomitance was not in the fathers daies hatched,
neither had they wit ynough to foresée the danger of spilling, and
hanging in lay mens beards, and such other déepe considerations
as the pope picked out long after out of his night cap.</p>

Epiphanius was conuersant, kept their faste of Quadragesima
but seauen daies afore Easter. The church of Rome kept it thrée

the libertie and diuersitie of the churches in kéeping of it was so
diuers and great, that Socrates (one of the authors of the tripar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite

the name of Quadragesima in all places remained one. Now sée
how truelie you thrust vpon vs vnder the name of Apostolicall

lesse is forgiuen: then it is manifest that loue is a consequent of

amongst whom he was conuersant, knewe nothing of this his
prerogatiue and superioritie, as appeareth by their reasoning of

                  <p>Your ordinarie lieng sheweth whom in conditions you resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and whose children yeare. What protestant hath taught that
the feare of hell is vtterly vnprofitable? We assigne many profits
which it bringeth: First, the wicked many times with the feare
thereof are terrified and bridled, that they run not so headlong to
the execution of their wicked desires, as otherwise they would.
Secondly, the elect and chosen children of God being by nature
as other men corrupt, are many times at the first by the feare of
hell, driuen to séeke Christ their onely remedie and deliuerer.
Thirdly, they are strengthened against the feare of man, when
they sée the eschewing of bodily death wold bring eternal death.
It is manifest therefore that that which you charge vs with, is
your malitious collection, and not our doctrine. But our doctrine
is, that they which by faith haue power to become the children
of God, do shew foorth their obedience of méere loue and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to God their father, and that they would so do, though
there were no hell to punish disobedience in. And that they who
would not shew any obedience, but for feare of hell, are hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
slaues, doing some dutie, not for dutifulnes, but onely for
feare of punishment.</p>

Abraham be paradise or hell, but in reasoning the case, he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
thrée reasons why it should not be hell: first, bicause hell is
named in the text in the death of the rich man, and not named in
the death or rest of Lazarus. Secondlie, bicause it is hard to finde
the name of hell in scriptures taken in good part, for a place of ioy
and rest: so that if the scriptures had said, that Christ had gone
into Abrahams bosome after death,<note place="margin">Epistola 99.</note> and had not told of the loosing
of the sorrowes of death, he would haue marueiled that any durst
haue béene so bold, as to haue affirmed that he discended into hel.

of the Catholikes: namelie, that the kingdome of heauen is a
place of ioy for the faithfull, and hell a place of punishment for

infidels and apostataes, and that a third place either for rest or
punishment is vnknowne, and no where found in scriptures.
These two places are héere liuelie described, for the rich man
went to hell, a place of torments: but Lazarus was caried into
Abrahams bosome, a place of ioy and rest. Heauen is called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams

there is no difference betwéene Iohns baptisme and it.
Otherwise in this place and in the like, Iohn considereth of him
selfe as of a seruant or minister, and of Christ, as of his master,
and Lord, and attributeth to him selfe the outward worke and
washing in baptisme, and to Christ the inward grace and worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship.

it were Gods good pleasure, that it should be so, how was not

which they chalenge for the bishop of Rome is an other, being

me one of those heretikes, that hold that all that Christ said, and
did, are written in the Scriptures. If you cannot do that, then

you abuse your reader with a lie. We saie, that enough is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Scriptures to bring beleeuers to life eternall, and so
hath Iohn written before vs.<note place="margin">Iohn 20. 31.</note> But it greeueth you that we giue
not credit to a number of lies, which you obtrude to vs vnder the
name of the apostles. If all that vnder their names you haue set
out be true: how chance their canons, and constitutions are not
better beléeued, and obserued in your Romish church?</p>

grosse and vntrue sense, which you papists take it in, in which
sense Augustine beléeued it not. For he disputing the matter to &amp;

the fathers which were in rest in Abrahams bosome, and vrgeth
against it the loosing of the sorrowes of hell,<note place="margin">Actes 2. 24.</note> mentioned in this

and rest vpon that which they sée hath good ground and warrant.
As for hell in that sense that you take it in, is true that he suffred

                  <head>The answer.</head>
                  <p>How prooue you that this was not the faith of the lame man?
Forsooth he looked for nothing but almes. At the first he did not.
What then? Nay he looked not for almes when they had told
him that they had neither gold nor siluer to giue. But as he cast
away the expectation of almes, so did he gréedily imbrace the gift
of health, offered him in the name of Iesus Christ. And this is
the faith which Peter héere speaketh of. If Peters hearers had
so vnderstood the matter as you take it, they might haue conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that they néeded not beléeue: other mens faith might make
them safe,<note place="margin">Acts. 14. 9.</note> as it did this man. How happened it that the lame
man of Lystra néeded his owne faith to be saued or healed? Was
not Pauls faith as good as Peters, if a man might be healed by
another mans faith without his owne? The residue of your note
is a riddle. For what is Christian religion? Is it not the imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:20995:66"/>
of the promises of saluation by faith? And then how is that
distinguished from the faith or beléeuing of a mans owne salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
But bicause you papists want the comfortable assurance of
Christians, therefore you deuise a new kind of faith to flatter
your selues withall, void of that comfort and assurance.</p>

First, you acknowledge Christs méere grace and mercie in our

                  <p>Were not the ten commandements part of the law of Moses?
And doth not Christ answer the yoong man that would know by
what doing he should haue life euerlasting, Kéepe the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements?
Did the curse of the law from which Christ deliuered
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:20995:89"/>
vs, extend no further than to temporall punishment? Perfect
righteousnes bringeth perfect life. The law is a perfect rule of
righteousnes: therefore if it could be fulfilled of vs, it should
bring vs to perfect eternall life. What meaneth Paul by his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of those two sentences; The iust shall liue by faith: And
he that doth these things shall liue in them; if one and the same
life eternall be not promised in both, in the one to beléeuers, in
the other to doers? Againe, if this your note were true, the law
of it selfe, and in it selfe, had béene too weake to iustifie or sanctifie,
but saint Paul saith not it was too weake in it selfe, but it was
weakened by the flesh, and therefore could not iustifie. But as all
poperie is patched togither of old and new heresies, so this patch
was borrowed of the Manicheans.</p>

God heauie iudgments: but you as you haue not the spirit of
adoption,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4. 18.</note> so you know no feare but seruile, which the loue of God
exileth and banisheth from it. For the sonnes of God though they
know and are well assured, that they shall abide in their fathers
house for euer, yet feare, tremble, and quake at euery threat of
his. Therefore this feare and certaintie of saluation are not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
one against the other. But to turn home your note to your
selues: God hath not spared the Iewes, nor Ierusalem, how shal
he then spare the Romans and Rome? Which therefore doth
aptly agrée with the scope and purpose of the Apostle, bicause he
compareth not ech particular man with other, but nation with
nation. For many particular men of the Iewes were not reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and in other nations multitudes haue not the faith, which
they professe themselues to haue. And therefore it followeth, that
as God reiected the Iewes, so he may reiect any other nation of
the Gentils. Which is the more diligently to be considered of
you, for that the holie Ghost by the Apostle made speciall choise
to set downe this threat to the Romans, who as you imagine

                  <p>You slander the protestants. Their maner of reasoning is not
so loose. They reason thus: Paul who so carefully reckoned and
saluted the chéefe and principall Christians at Rome by name,
would not haue forgotten Peter as the principall and chéefe, if he
had then béene there. Therefore it is very likely, that he was not
then there, bicause he was not then saluted. We know that it is
not materiall, whether Peter were at Rome or no, or whether
he were bishop there or no. And therfore they are not points that
we greatly sticke on. But those that tell the time of his comming
thither, and how long he liued, they are manifestly confuted by
the truth of the word, against which no credit of men can stand.
For his being bishop there, the consent is not so great as you
Thrasonically brag of. For some hold that neither he was bishop
there, nor made the first bishop there. Some make Paul as much
bishop there as Peter. That Peter might then be out of the citie,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Why we should thinke they learned of Peter, I sée no reason.
But for that which you would haue the simple beléeue, that by
the word which it pleaseth you to translate prince, Peters supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie
aboue the other Apostles is meant, they are to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
that the fathers giue the same name to Paule as well as
to Peter, whereby it appéereth, that they thought not of any such
supreme power or authoritie: which also is not onely manifest
by the continual practise of the first church, but also by plaine spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the fathers. Eusebius saith,<note place="margin">Ecclesiastica historia. lib. 20. cap. 1.</note> that neither Peter nor Iohn
tooke vpon them to be chéefe ouer the Apostles, but gaue the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie
to Iames whom they made bishop of the Apostles. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
saith, that all the Apostles were equal in authoritie. Ambrose
cannot tell of Peter and Paul whether of them he may preferre.
By this it is euident,<note place="margin">De simplicitate praelatorum sermone. 66.</note> that the fathers meant not by reuerend ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles

                  <p>Why haue you not thrust virginitie in amongst your sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
sith you hold it absolutely better than matrimonie? You
speake very nicely of marriage, being one of your sacrements:
Uirginitie counselled, marriage not forbidden. The reasons, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
virginitie is the better, but marriage no sinne. Is that the
best reason you can giue for the not forbidding of marriage, or
can you affoord it no better commendation? Is marriage a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and no where counselled nor commanded? Sure that were
very strange. The admirers of virginitie make marriage no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than sinne. For the end of it is death, saith Ierom in his first
booke against Iouinian. But to leaue your fansies of marriage
and virginitie, this I say, that either of them is better than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as time, place, persons, and other circumstances do serue for
the choise of the one or the other. Marriage is the holie ordinance
of the almightie, commanded to all that haue not the gift of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie.

was no péece of their meaning to giue to Peter anie soueraignty
ouer the rest of the Apostles, aswell bicause they giue those addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to others as to Peter, as also for that in expresse words they
make all the Apostles equall in authoritie, &amp; of Paul and Peter
they know not whether of them to preferre. But what néede we
fathers, are not the scriptures in this case plaine? did not Iames,
Peter,<note place="margin">Galat. 2 9.</note> and Iohn giue to Paul and Barnabas the right handes
(not of soueraigntie) but of societie,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 5.</note> and Paul estéemed not him

How did Paule deliuer that which he receiued of the Lord, if he

did not Christ leaue vnto his church an order for it? Though the

that in calling images by the names of those whom God created,
men turne the truth of God into a lie, and that their forme, and
shape, their honorable placing, and setting a loft in the church
hath more force to draw people to idolatrie, then the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that they haue no life, nor vse of their parts and members

against such idle bellies, as thought it vnlawfull for them to

                  <p>It is indéed a proper terme, and no heretike euer did beare a
more glorious shew than the papist. Uincentius Lirinensis was
carefull both to auoid all heresies himselfe, and also to admonish
others to take héed thereof. His lessons be good, such as we prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
and you refuse. For first he alloweth the canonical scriptures
as perfect and sufficient to determine al controuersies, which you
refuse. Secondly, to auoid the wrangling of heretikes about the
true interpretation of them, he adioineth tradition: which he
doth not take to be vnwritten verities not spoken of in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
(as you do) but for the sense and interpretation of them,
which was held and beléeued in the first churches planted by the
Apostles, by the Apostles I say, and their coadiutors direction.
Thirdly, he thinketh that not only the men of greatest fame and
estimation in the church might erre, but also that the whole or
greatest part of the visible church might erre (contrarie to your
assertion) which hold that the church cannot erre, and that in
that case he that will not be caried into error with multitude and
companie, must repaire vnto antiquitie, which is far from suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of prophane noueltie, euen as we at this day appeale to the
scriptures, and primitiue church. Now then if you will be iudged
by his rules, it will appéere that papists are craftie workers, and
so consequently heretikes, and bringers in of profane nouelties.</p>

this case. If amendment of life &amp; true repentance could be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
anie tokens or testimonies of heartie griefe, and sorrow for
sinnes passed, then your quarrell might haue some probable shew
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:20995:105"/>
in it, but now it hath vtterly none. Penitents in the primitiue
church did but giue testimonie vnto the church of their heartie
and vnfained repentance, and not (as you would haue men ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine)
satisfie for their sinnes, and deserue at Gods hand remission
and pardon therof. Augustine neuer dreamed of any such matter:
but he wrote against the Nouatians, who denied repentance to
them that sinned after they were baptized, against whom he proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
by the example of Peter which had denied Christ, &amp; by the
authoritie of this present text, that men after baptisme were not
to be excluded from repentance, and so maintaineth the custome
of the church in admitting penitents, which had béene afore for
their faults excommunicated: what is this to that you alledge

                  <p>Helpe, helpe, Paul hath set the popes kitchin on fire. Our Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
bring water, but it runneth out by the way. For both by
this, and the whole course of this epistle, we sée that this new
Gospell into the which the Galathians were translated, was a
péece of poperie: Namely, that they ioined in the cause of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp; saluation their works with Christ, &amp; the law with the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
But our Rhemists tel vs first, that not the works of charity,
but the works of the law are excluded by S. Paul. As who should
say, that there were any works of loue, that are not commanded
in the law. And therefore if the works of the law be excluded, the
works of loue and charitie must be excluded also. But to helpe
this, they adde that ceremonies, sacrifices, and sacraments are
meant principally. But against that, Paul maketh him accursed,
that abideth not in all that is written in the law to do it. If bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes
and iustification be our deliuerie from that curse, who sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not that the whole law, and euery part of it, and euery worke
of it must be excluded? But further they adde, that al works done
méerely by nature and frée will are excluded: wherein the word
méerely is to be noted, bicause it expresseth that their meaning is,
if there be a little helpe of faith or grace, that then works be not
excluded. To the which I say, this was the case of the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and the very matter against the which the Apostle bendeth
his whole force, for that they being Christians, and so beléeuers
did not exclude their works, and méerely ascribe their iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the grace of Christ: for that they parted the matter as the
papists do, betwixt Christ and their works, the whole maner of
the Apostles reasoning in the next chapter, doth plainely shew.

                  <p>This is plaine blasphemie, to place the proper cause of eternal
life, and saluation not in Christ, but in our selues, and in our
owne works of mercie, which you here most plainely do. Your
reason is taken out of the metaphor of séede, and sowing: The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of it is in this, that you racke the metaphor beyond the scope
and meaning of the apostle. For the apostle exhorteth them to
liberalitie, especially towards their teachers, and instructers in
the faith. To incourage men therunto, he telleth them that they
shall be as sure, or more sure of the rewardes promised of God,
then the sower shall be to reape, that which he soweth: and to
that end applieth the borrowed spéech of sowing, and reaping. To
racke those spéeches beyond this his meaning, is most plainely to
abuse him, and bewraieth the wickednes of your doctrine, which
cannot carrie any probable shew, without racking and wresting
the scriptures.</p>

that should be carefull ouer the flocke, that a number of them
shranke away after the world, and prouided rather for them
selues then for the flocke. And consider you well vpon this spéech,
whether Peters being at Rome then, when Paul wrote this
were likelie or no, when Paul had there none like minded to
him selfe. And it is a very simple shift to say that Peter might
then be absent from Rome for persecution or for businesse, séeing
that both the actes of the Apostles, &amp; the Epistle to the Romains,
&amp; euery epistle that Paul wrote from Rome, minister good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
against Peters being there, so that if he were bishop so long
as your stories testifie of him, he was a notable non Resident:

                  <p>It is true that Christs faith did grow and spread in the whole
world: yet you your selues will confesse, that it doth not alwaies
spread alike. For I know you will except our times. And we wil
except the times, wherein the Arrians florished, who (as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port)
continued longer, and was better defended by princes and
worldly power than we are now. Then it cannot be a question
how quickly some corruptions grew, but whether any great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:20995:113"/>
or lessening of the number of true Catholikes may be.
But the ancient testimonies of stories do also put that out of
doubt. This repugnance you speake of we sée not. Neither haue
our conuenticles (as it pleaseth you to terme them) béene at any
time more obscure than the assemblies of Christians in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
church, as you your selues cannot choose but confesse. S.
Augustine whose authoritie you alledge, in his latter daies saw a
greater decay of the Christian faith, by the cruel inuasion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
barbarous nations that did ouerrun both Europe and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frike,
than he did thinke, when he wrote that Epistle, possible to
haue béene in so short a space. And further, if we consider the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the times since, we shal find that, that the bounds of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom
haue béene greatly lessened, and diminished since saint
Augustines time: Flat contrarie to his opinion in that Epistle.</p>

                  <p>We translate truely, when in stéede of idols, we say images.
Our construction and application also is true, bicause both your
hauing of images in churches, and also all maner worship you
vsed about them procéeded, and came from Gentilisme, so that the
spéeches and reasons, which the apostles &amp; prophets vsed against
them, are aptly applied against your images, and the follies you
commit about them. Your annotation you referre vs to, is like
your selues, matter whereof you might be ashamed, if you had
any shame in you. For it hath béene often answered, and it is
enough for you barely to repeate it againe. Your councel of Nice
were impudent, &amp; shamelesse asses, &amp; beasts, giuing that to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which you your selues dare not defend.<note place="margin">Ecclesiast hist. l. b. 7. cap. 14.</note> Eusebius in the place
you cite, though he aloweth of that image, yet sheweth that that,
&amp; the like grew out of the corrupt customes of the Gentils, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he saith, that is no maruell, that some did sticke in new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted

laie mens books. But I refer your annotation to farther answer

                  <head>The answer.</head>
                  <p>Now Augustine must helpe you with a generall rule, &amp; that
expresselie both against the whole course of scripture, and also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his owne minde, if you meane by permission onlie permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
for he saith, who doeth not tremble at these horrible iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, by which he doth in the hearts of the wicked what
he will, rendring to euerie man according to his merits. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:20995:118"/>
he saith, it is out of doubt that God doeth worke in the
mindes of men to encline their willes, either to good according to
his mercie,<note place="margin">De gratia &amp; libero arbitrio cap. 21.</note> or els to euill according to their deserts by his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
sometimes open and sometimes secret, but alwaies iust.
This I trowe is somewhat more then only permission, therefore
you must racke some other for that generall rule, for Augustine
will not yéeld it you: and it groweth out of a foolish nicenes, for
men to be afraid to speake as the holie Ghost hath spoken afore
them.</p>

                  <p>Héere you say that that is plaine, which no wise man can sée:

for that purpose, sith in the very ordering they should be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
indued with gifts and graces necessarie and néedfull? And
how fel it out that there were so great a number of popish priests
void and destitute of al gifts &amp; graces after their ordering, when
the bishop had conferred and bestowed vpon them all that he
could? It is euident by the manifold commendations that the
Apostle giueth to Timothie,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 16.</note> as well for his owne studie in the
scriptures,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 14. 15.</note> as also for his bringing vp vnder his mother, and
grandmother, that he was a man furnished with gifts afore Paul
and the elders ordered him. But bicause the praiers of the church
in that his consecrating to the worke of God, were not in vaine,
that blessing and increase of aptnesse and fitnesse, which God at
their petitions gaue him at that time, is called the gift or grace
by imposition of hands. In the like order it is true, that all those

                  <p>It is strange to sée how boldly our papists can set downe that,
which by no meanes they can be sure of, first therefore good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thou art to vnderstand, that by the testimonie of all stories
Peter and Paul suffered death at Rome both in one day. If euer
Linus therefore were bishop of Rome by the Apostles life time,
he was at this present, when they were so néere their end, that
they dailie looked to be sacrificed. But it is not likelie that he was
as then aduaunced to that dignitie, when neither Paul mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
him as bishop, or as his or Peters coadiutor or fellow la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer,
and also setteth diuers other Christians afore him in
his salutation, which had béene a verie vnmannerlie part, and a
great forgetfulnesse of dutie in the Apostles, if Linus had then
béene Bishop there, and so Christs vicar generall. But bicause
you terme him Saint Peters coadiutor there, I pray you tel me,
was Saint Peter there now or no, I will not vse the reason,
that Paul not onlie héere but alwaies forgetteth him amongst
those whom he nameth in his salutations, whereof groweth
great likelihood that he was neuer there whiles Paul wrote
thence. But if he were now and before there,<note place="margin">verse. 15.</note> Paul maketh a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
great and pitifull complaint of him, that he amongst the rest
forsook him. But I had rather say he was not yet come to Rome,
and that Paul made Linus the first Bishop there, as your Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
also affirmeth, then to admit so great an absurditie against
Peter. The succession of the bishops of Rome which you so much
glory of, and vpon the authoritie whereof your church resteth, is
vncertaine, vaine, obscure, and such as your selues can make no
certaine report of.</p>

                  <p>I easily beléeue that he ment not of that which was not, for
your churches superstition in that matter was not yet growne.
But you haue brought about by your lawes of abstinencie, that
your simple followers, in the extremitie of sicknes when there
cannot be any pretence of chastening their bodies thereby, are so
snarled in conscience, that they dare not touch, or tast, that which
is necessary to preserue life, and to restore health withal. Besides
chastening of your bodies, in your ordinarie abstinence in pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
hath no probable shew. For your richer sort neuer fare more
delicately, nor fill their bellies more gluttonouslie, then when
they abstaine from ordinarie meats, and hunt after extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

                  <head>The answer.</head>
                  <p>The Scriptures (you say) containe not all necessarie rites
and truthes, whie do you couple rites and truthes togither? You
know that we hold that rites and ceremonies may be variable
according to diuersitie of times, places, and maners of people: so
the generall rules of Scriptures giuen to frame them by be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.
But truth is alwaies one and the same, &amp; not to be found
but in the word of truth, and therefore though you could haue
prooued that some of these rites were had by tradition, yet it
would not followe that anie necessarie truth were omitted in
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:20995:129"/>
scriptures. But let vs sée how doughtilie you prooue that, forsooth
halfe the ceremonies here spoken of, are not mentioned in the
place of Scripture, to the which the Apostle alludeth, nor in anie
other place, and therfore it can not be otherwise, but he had them
by tradition. As you are true in this, so I would you might finde
credit in all things els:<note place="margin">Exod. 14. 8.</note> first in the place by your selues quoted,
the reading of the Lawe, the sprinkling of the people and the
book, with the blood of the sacrifices, with the words here rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are mentioned. Then resteth water, skarlet wool and hissope,
to be shewed els where. In Leuiticus we finde that water was
mingled with the blood which was to be sprinckled,<note place="margin">Leuit. 14. 4.</note> and that the
sprinckle it selfe was made of cedar wood, of hissope, and of a skar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
lace. Thus haue you one place for the sprinckling, and another
for the sprinkle, and nothing héere at all by tradition, which you
so contend for.</p>

                  <p>You shew your delight, you séeke to deceiue your selues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by equiuocations. For you know well ynough, that faith is
not taken héere for a true and a liuely faith, which worketh by
loue, as Paul and we take it, when we speake of iustifieng by
faith. Secondly, you know also, that we make no account of anie
such faith as is idle, or separated from loue. Thirdly, you know
that saint Iames taketh not héere iustifieng, for being made iust,
but for being declared and shewed to be iust: as appéereth by the
example of Abraham which he bringeth. For God first made him
iust, and afterward he was declared and shewed so to be, by that
most excellent example of obedience, in offering his sonne Isaac.
There is therfore no contrarietie betwixt vs and Iames, though
you go about to prooue that by sound of words, which by sound or

grounded vpon a malicious slander, that we denie Christs
descending into hell, wheras we onely denie the popish sense and
interpretation of that article. And concerning Augustine, your
note booke once againe deceiued you. For in the place which you
quote, there is nothing touching this matter: but in his 99. epistle
he handleth this place, and especially the former in the thirde
chapter at large concerning Christs preaching to disobedient
persons in the daies of Noe. Where after that by many reasons
he had prooued that your opinion whereby you apply this place
to Christs descending into hell, can by no meanes stand: he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth
(though not fully and certainly) that it is not ment at all
of Christs descending into hell, and rather thinketh that Peter
meaneth that those times of Noe, were a figure of our times, and
the generall disobedience then, a figure of the small obedience
now, and the sauing of Noe, and his familie in the arke then, a
figure of sauing vs now by baptisme, and so consequently giueth

Pope Iohn the thirtéenth was slaine being taken in the age of

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of dominion: your popes haue not only vsurped the place
&amp; seat of their soueraigne lords, but haue also troden vpon them,
deposed Emperors and kings from their roial estate, made them
his pages to lead his horse and hold his stirrop, and to thinke it a

turne Saint Augustine to vs. Wherein still is to be noted that
you of purpose flie from these works, which Augustine wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

speaketh little of it, and that but by the way. The spéech that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine
vseth in this place is this: that God sanctifieth, but hée
sanctifieth not them which are not willing to be sanctified. And
therfore bicause man adioineth his will to God, he is said to sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
himselfe. This spéech of Augustine though it may be racked
against his minde, to serue your assertion of fréewill, yet being
interpreted according to his vndoubted meaning (as in manie

God altered, and to whom God also giueth power in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

earth, as often in the scriptures. Though it be not against the scriptures,
that the inferior saint or Angell in heauen should offer their praiers to
God by their superiors there: but heerby we conclude against the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
that it derogateth not from Christ, that Angels or saints offer vp
our praiers to God. As also it is plaine of Raphael, Tab. 12. 12.</p>

                  <p>Such premisses, such conclusion. You must haue that, which
you dare not certainly set downe, granted you, or else your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
carieth not so much as anie shew, or likelihood of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
That diuers take this Angell to be Christ, you your selues
confesse, and that Christ is many times in scriptures called an
Angell, I am sure you will not denie. That one Angell offereth,
and not many, what can it signifie, but that we haue one media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
not many: and if we haue but one, then why may not Christ
be he? That of the 24. elders in the fift chapter, is a vision of the
saints vpon the earth, offering their owne praiers. For Iohn in
that chapter doth not describe the state of the church as it shall be
in heauen, but as it is héere vpon the earth: and therefore setteth
it downe magnifieng and praising the lambe, by whom the booke
was opened, that is, Gods will in his word reuealed and made
knowen. But you did well to tell vs that saints héere are taken
for holy persons vpon earth: for your blind schollers do not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that there be any saints, but those which are dead and gone,
and which the pope hath canonized, and are to be found in his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar.
If the superior saints offer the praiers of the inferior,
then we néed to learne the orders of saints and Angels in heauen,
that we go not to them, that themselues néed the helpe and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of others. But who can so tell vs, that we may beléeue
him? You say it is not against the scriptures. If it be scripture
that telleth vs, that we haue an aduocate with the father Iesus
Christ, who is the propitiation for our sinnes, and that we haue
one mediator, then multitude of mediators and aduocates is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
scripture. We dare not beléeue your dreames, which are
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:20995:149"/>
no where warranted in the word. And we maruell not, that you
thinke it no derogation to Christ, to take away his mediatorship
of intercession, when you make him but halfe a redéemer, and
halfe a sauiour. As for that of Raphaell it may serue to deceiue
your simple followers withall, but not to confirme any matter of
controuersie against your learned aduersaries, who know it not
to be canonicall scriptures.</p>

citie is not ment? The whole number of the reprobate shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish

the head, and principall citie of the diuels kingdome, is not ment

in that chapter is not named, and though it be by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
desciphered, I sée nothing why there also, it should not be
taken for the citie it selfe. But howsoeuer it be taken there, it is
most manifest, that here it must be taken for Rome. For what
other citie is situate on seauen hils? what other citie hath had
kingdome ouer the kings of the earth? what other city hath made
the nations to erre in her inchauntments? and in what citie else
may a man finde the blood of the prophets, and saints that haue
béene slaine vpon the earth? So that the reasons that lead vs to
vnderstand it of Rome are so many, and so plaine, that except a
man would shut his eies against the light, he cannot choose but
sée it. Yet this is farther to be gathered, that the head and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
