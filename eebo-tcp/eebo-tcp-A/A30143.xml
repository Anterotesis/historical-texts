         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CHildren, Grace be with you, <hi>Amen.</hi> I being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from you in presence, and so tied up, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform that duty that from God doth lie upon me, to you-ward, for your further edifying and building up in Faith and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet that you may see my
<pb facs="tcp:93900:3"/>
Soul hath fatherly care and desire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your spiritual and everlasting Welfare; I now once again, as from the top of <hi>Shenir</hi> and <hi>Hermon,</hi> so from <hi>the Lions Dens, and from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Leopards,</hi> (Song <hi>4.8.)</hi> do look yet after you all, greatly long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to see your safe arrival into <hi>THE</hi> desired Haven.</p>
            <p>I thank God upon every Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of you, and rejoyce even while I stick between the Teeth of the Lions in the Wilderness, at the grace, and mercy, and knowledge of Christ our Saviour, which God hath bestowed upon you, with abundance of Faith and Love. Your hungerings and thirstings also after further acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Father in his Son; your tenderness of Heart, your trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at sin, your sober and holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment also, before both God and men, is great refreshment to me: <hi>for you are my glory and joy, 1</hi> Thes. <hi>2.20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have sent you here enclosed a drop of that honey, that I have taken out of
<pb facs="tcp:93900:3"/>
the Carcase of a Lyon, <hi>Judg. 14.5, 6, 7, 8.</hi> I have eaten thereof my self al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and am much refreshed thereby. (Temptations when we meet them at first, are as the Lyon that roared up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Sampson:</hi> but if we overcome them, the next time we see them, we shall finde a Nest of Honey within them.) The Philistians understand me not. It is a Relation of the work of God upon my own Soul, even from the very first, till now; wherein you may perceive my castings down, and raisings up: for he woundeth, and his hands make whole. It is written in the Scripture, <hi>Isai. 38.19. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the children shall make known the truth of God.</hi> Yea, it was for this reason I lay so long at <hi>Sinai, (Lev. 4.10, 11.)</hi> to see the fire, and the cloud, and the darkness, <hi>that I might fear the Lord all the days of my life upon earth, and tell of his wondrous works to my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> Psal. <hi>78.3, 4, 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moses, <hi>Numb. 33.1, 2.</hi> writ of the
<pb facs="tcp:93900:4"/>
Journeyings of the children of <hi>Israel</hi> from <hi>Egypt</hi> to the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and commanded also, that they did remember their forty years travel in the wilderness. <hi>Thou shalt remem-all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, and to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments or no,</hi> Deut. <hi>8.2, 3.</hi> Wherefore this I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to do; and not onely so, but to publish it also; that, if God will, others may be put in remembrance of of what he hath done for their Souls, by reading his work upon me.</p>
            <p>It is profitable for Christians to be often calling to mind the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Grace with their Souls. <hi>It is a night to be much observed to the Lord, for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of the Lord to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> Exod. <hi>12.42. My God,</hi> saith
<pb facs="tcp:93900:4"/>
David, <hi>Psal. 42.6. my soul is cast down within me; but I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.</hi> He remembred also the Lyon and the Bear, when he went to fight with the Giant of <hi>Gath, 1 Sam. 17.36, 37</hi>:</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Pauls</hi> accustomed manner, <hi>Acts 22.</hi> and that when tried for his life, <hi>Acts 24.</hi> even to open before his Judges the manner of his Conversion: He would think of that day and that hour, in the which he first did meet with Grace: for he found it support unto him When God had brought the children of <hi>Israel</hi> thorow the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> far into the wilderness; yet they must turn quite about thither again, to remember the drowning of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies there, <hi>Num. 14.25.</hi> for though they sang his praise before, yet they soon forgat his works, <hi>Psal. 106.11, 12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Discourse of mine, you may see much; much, I say, of the Grace
<pb facs="tcp:93900:5"/>
of God towards me: I thank <hi>God</hi> I can count it much; for it was above my sins, and Satans temptations too. I can remember my fears, and doubts, and sad moneths, with comfort; they are as the head of <hi>Goliah</hi> in my hand: there was nothing to <hi>David</hi> like <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liahs</hi> sword, even that sword that should have been sheathed in his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; for the very sight and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that, did preach forth <hi>Gods</hi> Deliverance to him. O the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my great sins, of my great temptations, and of my great fears of perishing for ever! They bring fresh into my mind, the remembrance of my great help, my great support from Heaven, and the great grace that <hi>God</hi> extended to such a Wretch as I.</p>
            <p>My dear Children, call to mind the former days, the years of ancient times; remember also your songs in the night, and commune with your own heart, <hi>Psal. 73.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</hi> Yea, look diligently, and leave no corner therein unsearched, for there is

               </gap>reasure hid, even the treasure of your first and second experience of the grace of <hi>God</hi> toward you. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I say, the Word that first laid hold upon you; remember your ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of conscience, and fear of death and hell: remember also your tears and prayers to <hi>God;</hi> yea, how you sighed under every hedge for mercy. Have you never a Hill <hi>Mizar</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member? Have you forgot the Close, the Milk-house, the Stable, the Barn, and the like, where <hi>God</hi> did visit your Soul? Remember also the Word, the Word, I say, upon which the Lord hath caused you to hope: If you have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against light, if you are tempted to blaspheme, if you are down in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, if you think <hi>God</hi> fights against you, or if heaven is hid from your eyes; remember 'twas thus with your Father, <hi>but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="13">13. This conceit grew so strong in little time upon my spirit, that had <hi>I</hi> but seen a Priest, (though never so sordid and debauched in his life) <hi>I</hi> should find my spirit fall under him, reverence him, and knit unto him; yea, <hi>I</hi> thought for the love <hi>I</hi> did bear unto them, (supposing they were the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of my God) <hi>I</hi> could have layn down at their feet, and have been trampled upon by them; their Name, their Garb, and Work, did so intoxicate and bewitch me.</p>

            <p n="23">23. At this reproof I was silenced, and put to secret shame; and that too, as I thought, before the God of Heaven: wherefore while I there stood, and hanging down my head, I wished with all my heart that I might be a little childe again, that my Father might learn me to speak without this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way of swearing: for thought <hi>I,</hi> I am so accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to it, that it is but in vain for me to think of a reformation, for I thought it could never be.</p>
            <p n="24">24. But how it came to pass I know not, I did from this time forward so leave my swearing, that it was a great wonder to my self to observe it; and whereas before I knew not how to speak unless I put an Oath before, and another behind, to make my words have authority, now I could speak bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with more pleasantness then ever I could before: all this while I knew not Jesus Christ, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did <hi>I</hi> leave my sports and play.</p>
            <p n="25">25. But quickly after this, <hi>I</hi> fell in company with one poor man, that made profession of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; Who, as <hi>I</hi> then thought, did talk pleasantly of the Scriptures, and of the matters of Religion: wherefore falling into some love and liking to what he said, <hi>I</hi> betook me to my Bible, and began to take great pleasu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e in reading, but especially with the historical part thereof: for as for <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, and Scriptures of that nature, I could not away with them, being as yet but ignorant either of the corruptions of my nature, or of the want and worth of Jesus Christ to save me.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Wherefore <hi>I</hi> fell to some outward Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both in my words and life, and did set the Commandments before me for my way to Heaven: which Commandments. I also did strive to keep; and, as I thought, did keep them pretty well some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93900:11"/>
and then <hi>I</hi> should have comfort; yet now and then should break one, and so afflict my Conscience; but then <hi>I</hi> should repent, and say <hi>I</hi> was sorry for it, and promise God to do better next time, and there get help again.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Thus <hi>I</hi> continued about a year, all which time our Neighbours did take me to be a very godly man, a new and religious man, and did mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel much to see such a great and famous alteration in my life and manners; and indeed so it was, though yet <hi>I</hi> knew not Christ, nor Grace, nor Faith, nor Hope; and truly as <hi>I</hi> have well seen since, had <hi>I</hi> then died, my state had been most fearful: well, this <hi>I</hi> say, continued about a twelve-month, or more.</p>
            <p n="28">28. But upon a day, the good Providence of God did cast me to <hi>Bedford,</hi> to work on my calling; and in one of the streets of that town, <hi>I</hi> came where there was three or four poor women sitting at a door in the Sun, and talking about the things of God; and being now willing to hear them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, <hi>I</hi> drew near to hear what they said; for I was now a brisk talker also my self in the matters of Religion: but now <hi>I</hi> may say, <hi>I heard, but I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not,</hi> for they were far above out of my reach, for their talk was about a new birth, the work of God on their hearts, also how they were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of their miserable stare by nature: they talked how God had visited their souls with his love in the Lord Jesus, and with what words and promises they had been refreshed, comforted, and supported against the temptations of the Devil; moreover, they reasoned of the suggestions and temptations of Satan in particular, and told to each other by which they had been afflicted, and how they were born up under his assaults: they also discoursed of their own wretchedness of heart, of their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and did contemn, slight and abhor their own
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93900:11"/>
righteousness, as filthy, and insufficient to do them any good.</p>
            <p n="29">29. And me thought they spake as if joy did make them speak: they spake with such plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of Scripture language, and with such appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of grace in all they said, that they were to me as if they had found a new world, as if they were people that dwelt alone, and were not to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned amongst their Neighbou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s.</p>
            <p n="30">30. At this <hi>I</hi> felt my own heart began to shake, as mistrusting my condition to be naught; for <hi>I</hi> saw that in all my thoughts about Religion and Salvation, the New birth did never enter into my mind, neither knew <hi>I</hi> the comfort of the Word and Promise, nor the deceitfulness and treachery of my own wicked heart. As for secret thoughts, I took no notice of them; neither did <hi>I</hi> understand what Satans temptations were, nor how they were to be withstood and resisted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="31">31. Thus therefore when <hi>I</hi> had heard and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered what they said, <hi>I</hi> left them, and went about my employment again: but their talk and discourse went with me, also my heart would tarry with them, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> was greatly affected with their words, both because by them <hi>I</hi> was convinced that <hi>I</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the true tokens of a truly godly man, and also because by them <hi>I</hi> was convinced of the happy and blessed condition of him that was such a one.</p>
            <p n="32">32. Therefore <hi>I</hi> should often make it my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to be going again and again into the company of these poor people; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> could not stay away; and the more <hi>I</hi> went amongst them, the more <hi>I</hi> did question my condition; and, as still <hi>I</hi> do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, presently <hi>I</hi> found two things within me, at which I did sometimes marvel, (especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering what a blind, ignorant, so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>did and ungodly Wretch but just before <hi>I</hi> was) the one was, a very
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93900:12"/>
great softness and tenderness of heart, which caused me to fall under the conviction of what by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, they asserted; and the other was, a great bending in my mind to a continual meditating on them, and on all other good things which at any time <hi>I</hi> heard or read of.</p>
            <p n="33">33. My mind was now so turned, that it lay like a Horseleach at the vein, still crying out, <hi>Give, give</hi>; yea, it was so fixed on Eternity, and on the things about the Kingdome of Heaven, that is, so far as <hi>I</hi> knew, though as yet <hi>God</hi> knows, <hi>I</hi> knew but little, that neither pleasures, nor profits, nor perswasions, nor threats, could loosen it, or make it let go its hold; and, thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h <hi>I</hi> may speak it with shame, yet it is in very deed a certain truth, it would then have been as difficult for me to have taken my mind from heaven to earth, as <hi>I</hi> have found it often since to get it again from earth to heaven.</p>
            <p n="34">34. And now me thought <hi>I</hi> began to look into the Bible with new eyes, and read as <hi>I</hi> never did before; and especially the Epistles of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> were sweet and pleasant to me: and indeed <hi>I</hi> was then never out of the Bible, either by reading or meditation, still crying out to <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> might know the truth, and way to heaven and glory.</p>
            <p n="35">35. And as <hi>I</hi> went on and read, <hi>I</hi> lighted on that passage, <hi>To one is given by the Spirit the word of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and to another Faith,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 12. And though, as <hi>I</hi> have since seen, that by this Scripture the holy Ghost intends, in special, things extraordinary, yet on me it then did fasten with conviction, that I did, want things ordinary, even that understanding and wisdome that other Christians had. On this word <hi>I</hi> mused, and could not tell what to do, for <hi>I</hi> feared it shut me out of all the blessings that other good people had given them of <hi>God</hi>: but <hi>I</hi> was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93900:12"/>
loath to conclude <hi>I</hi> had no Faith in my soul: for if <hi>I</hi> do so, thought <hi>I,</hi> then <hi>I</hi> shall count my self a very Cast-away indeed.</p>
            <p n="36">36. No, said I with my self, though <hi>I</hi> am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that <hi>I</hi> am an ignorant Sot, and that I want those blessed gifts of knowledge and understanding that other good people have, yet at a venture <hi>I</hi> will conclude <hi>I</hi> am not altogether faithless, though I know not what Faith is. For it was shewed me, and that too (as <hi>I</hi> have since seen) by Satan, That those who conclude themselves in a faithless state, have neither rest nor quiet in their Souls; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was loath to fall quite into despair.</p>
            <p n="37">37. Wherefore by this suggestion, <hi>I</hi> was for a while made afraid to see my want of Faith; but God would not suffer me thus to undo and destroy my <hi>Soul,</hi> but did continually against this my blinde and sad conclusion, create still within me such sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, That <hi>I</hi> might in this deceive my self; that <hi>I</hi> could not rest con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent until <hi>I</hi> did now come to some certain knowledge whether <hi>I</hi> had Faith or no; this always running in my minde, <hi>But how if you want Faith indeed? but how can you tell you have Faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="38">38. So that though <hi>I</hi> endeavoured at the first to look over the business of Faith, yet in a little time, I better considering the matter, was willing to put my self upon the tryal, whether <hi>I</hi> had Faith or no. But alas, poor Wretch! so ignorant and brutish was <hi>I,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> knew to this day no more how to do it, than <hi>I</hi> know how to begin and accomplish that rare and curious piece of Art, which <hi>I</hi> never yet saw nor considered.</p>
            <p n="39">39. Wherefore while <hi>I</hi> was thus considering, and being put to my plunge about it (for you must know that as yet <hi>I</hi> had in this matter broken my mind to no man, onely did hear and consider) the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93900:13"/>
Tempter came in with this delusion, That there was no way for me to know I had Faith, but by trying to work some miracle, urging those <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> that seem to look that way, for the inforcing and strengthening his Temptation. Nay, one day as I was betwixt <hi>Elstow</hi> and <hi>Bedford,</hi> the temptation was hot upon me to try if I had Faith by doing of some miracle; which miracle at that time was this, I must say to the puddles that were in the horse pads, <hi>Be dry</hi>; and to the dry places, <hi>Be you the puddles:</hi> and truly one time I was a going to say so indeed; but just as I was about to speak, this thought came into my minde, <hi>But go under yonder Hedge, and pray first, that God would make you able:</hi> but when I had concluded to pray, this came hot upon me, That if I prayed and came again and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do it, and yet did nothing notwithstanding, then besure <hi>I</hi> had no Faith, but was a Cast-away, and lost: Nay, thought I, if it be so, <hi>I</hi> will never try yet, but will stay a little longer.</p>
            <p n="40">40. So I continued at a great loss: for I thought if they onely had Faith which could do such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things, then I concluded that for the present I neither had it, nor yet for time to come were ever like to have it. Thus I was tossed betwixt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and my own ignorance, and so perplexed, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at some times, that <hi>I</hi> could not tell what to doe.</p>
            <p n="41">41. About this time, the state and happiness of these poor people at <hi>Bedford</hi> was thus in a Dream or Vision represented to me: I saw as if they were set on the Sunny side of some high Mountain, there refreshing themselves with the pleasant beams of the Sun, while I was shivering and shrinking in the cold, afflicted with frost, snow, and dark clouds; methought also betwixt me and them I saw a wall that did compass about this Mountain; now tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93900:13"/>
this wall, my Soul did greatly desire to pass, concluding that if I could, I would goe even into the very midst of them, and there also comfort my self with the heat of their Sun.</p>
            <p n="42">42. About this wall I thought my self to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, still prying as <hi>I</hi> went, to see if <hi>I</hi> could find some way or passage by which <hi>I</hi> might enter therein, but none could <hi>I</hi> find for some time: at the last <hi>I</hi> saw as it were a narrow gap, like a little door-way in the wall, thorow which <hi>I</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to pass: but the passage being very straight, and narrow, <hi>I</hi> made many offers to get in, but all in vain, even untill <hi>I</hi> was well nigh quite beat out by striving to get in: at last with great striving, me thought <hi>I</hi> at first did get in my head, &amp; after that by a side-ling striving, my shoulders, and my whole body; then was <hi>I</hi> exceeding glad, and went and sat down in the midst of them, and so was comforted with the light and heat of their Sun.</p>
            <p n="43">43. Now this Mountain and Wall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was thus made out to me; the Mountain signified the Church of the living God; the Sun that shone thereon, the comfortable shining of his mercifull face on them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hat were therein: the wall <hi>I</hi> thought was the Word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="44">44. This resemblance abode upon my spirit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93900:14"/>
dayes, all which time I saw my self in a sorlorn and sad condition, but yet was provoked to a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hunger, and desire to be one of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that did sit in this Sun-shine: now also I should pray where ever I was, whether at home or a broad, in house or field, and should also often with lifting up of heart, sing that of the fifty first Psalm, <hi>O Lord, consider my distress:</hi> for as yet <hi>I</hi> knew not where <hi>I</hi> was.</p>
            <p n="45">45. Neither as yet could <hi>I</hi> attain to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable perswasion that <hi>I</hi> had Faith in Chirst, but instead of having satisfaction, here I began to find my Soul to be assaulted with fresth doubts about my future happiness, especially with such as these, Whether <hi>I</hi> was elected; but how if the day of grace should now be past and gone?</p>
            <p n="46">46. By these two temptations <hi>I</hi> was very much afflicted and disquieted; sometimes by one, and sometimes by the other of them. And first, to speak of that about my questioning my election, I found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and what if you should not? how then?</p>
            <p n="48">48. O Lord, thought <hi>I,</hi> what if I should not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? it may be you are not, laid the Tempter: it may be so indeed, thought I. Why then, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="49">49. By these things I was driven to my wits end, not knowing what to say, or how to answer these temptations, (indeed <hi>I</hi> little thought that Satan had thus assaulted me, but that rather it was my own prudence thus to start the question) for that the Elect only attained eternal life, that <hi>I</hi> without scruple did heartily close withall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that my self was one of them, there lay all the question.</p>
            <p n="50">50. Thus therefore for several dayes <hi>I</hi> was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assaulted and perplexed, and was often, when I have been walking, ready to sink where I went with faintness in my mind: but one day, after I had been so many weeks oppressed and cast down therewith, as <hi>I</hi> was now quite giving up the Ghost of all my hopes of ever attaining life, that sentence fell with weight upon my spirit, <hi>Look at the generations of old, and see, did ever any trust in God and were confounded?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="51">51. At which I was greatly lightened, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in my Soul; for thus at that very instant it was expounded to me: <hi>Begin at the beginning of Genesis, and read to the end of the Revelations, see if you can find that there was any that ever trusted in the Lord, and was Confounded.</hi> So coming home, <hi>I</hi> presently went to my Bible to see if I could find that saying, not doubting but to find it presently, for it was so fresh, and with such strength and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93900:15"/>
on my spirit, that I was as if it talked with me.</p>
            <p n="52">52. Well, <hi>I</hi> looked, but <hi>I</hi> found it not, only it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode upon me: then I did aske first this good man, and then another, if they knew where it was; but they knew no such place: at this <hi>I</hi> wondered that such a sentence should so suddenly and with such comfort, and strength seize and abide upon my heart, and yet that none could find it, (for <hi>I</hi> doubted not but it was in holy Scripture.)</p>
            <p n="53">53. Thus I continued above a year, and could not find the place, but at last, casting my eye into the Apocrypha-Books, <hi>I</hi> sound it in <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi>; this at the first did somewhat daunt me, but because by this time <hi>I</hi> had got more experience of the love and k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndness of God, it troubled me the less; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when I considered, that though it was not in those Texts that we call holy and Canonical, yet for as much as this sentence was the sum and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of many of the promises, it was my duty to to take the comfort of it, and I bless God for that word, for it was of God to me: that word doth still at times shine before my face.</p>
            <p n="54">54. After this, that other doubt did come with strength upon me, <hi>But how if the day of grace should be past and gone?</hi> how if you have over-stood the time of mercy? Now <hi>I</hi> remember that one day as I was walking into the Country, <hi>I</hi> was much in the thoughts of this, But how if the day of grace be past? and to aggravate my trouble, the Tempter presented to my mind those good people of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and suggested thus unto me, That these being converted already, they were all that God would save in those parts, &amp; that <hi>I</hi> came too late, for these had got the blessing before <hi>I</hi> came.</p>
            <p n="55">55. Now was <hi>I</hi> in great distress, thinking in very deed that this might well be so: wherefore <hi>I</hi> wen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:93900:15"/>
up and down bemoaning my sad condition, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my self far worse then a thousand fools, for standing off thus long, and spending so many years in sin as <hi>I</hi> have done; still crying out! Oh that <hi>I</hi> had turned sooner! Oh that <hi>I</hi> had turned seven years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe; it made me also angry with my self, to think that <hi>I</hi> should have no more wit but to trifle away my time till my Soul and Heaven were lost.</p>
            <p n="56">56. But when <hi>I</hi> had been long vexed with this fear, and was scarce able to take one step more, just about the same place where <hi>I</hi> received my other encouragement, these words broke in upon my mind, <hi>Compell them to come in, that my house may be filled, and yet there is roome,</hi> Luke 14.22, 23. These words, but especially them, <hi>And yet there is roome,</hi> were sweet words to me; for truly I thought that by them <hi>I</hi> saw that there was place enough in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for me, and moreover, that when the Lord Jesus did speak these words, he then did think of me, and that he knowing the time would come that I should be afflicted with fear, that there was no place left for me in his bosome, did before speak this word, and leave it upon record, that <hi>I</hi> might find help thereby against this vile temptation.</p>
            <p n="57">57. In the light and encouragement of this word, <hi>I</hi> went a pretty while, and the comfort was the more, when <hi>I</hi> thought that the Lord Jesus should think on me so long agoe, and that he should speak them words on purpose for my sake, for I did then think verily that he did on purpose speak them to encourage me withall.</p>
            <p n="58">58. After this, <hi>I</hi> found by reading the word, that those that must be glorified with Christ in another world, <hi>Must be called by him here.</hi> Called to the partaking of a share in his word and righteousness, and to the comforts &amp; first-fruits of his Spirit, and to a peculiar interest in all those Heavenly things,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93900:16"/>
which do indeed fore-fit the Soul for that rest and house of glory which is in Heaven above.</p>
            <p n="59">59. Here again I was at a very great stand, not knowing what to doe, fearing <hi>I</hi> was not called; for thought <hi>I,</hi> if I be not called, what then can doe me good? But oh how <hi>I</hi> now loved those words that spake of a <hi>Christians calling</hi>! as when the Lord said to one, <hi>Follow me</hi>; and to another, <hi>Come after me</hi> and oh thought <hi>I,</hi> that he would say so to me too! how gladly would <hi>I</hi> run after him.</p>
            <p n="60">60. <hi>I</hi> cannot now express with what longings and breakings in my Soul, <hi>I</hi> cryed to Christ to call me. Thus <hi>I</hi> continued for a time all on a flame to be converted to Jesus Christ, and did also see at that day such glory in a converted state, that <hi>I</hi> could not be contented without a share therein. Gold! could it have been gotten for Gold, what could <hi>I</hi> have given for it! had <hi>I</hi> had a whole world, it had all gone ten thousand times over, for this, that my Soul might have been in a converted state.</p>
            <p n="61">61. How lovely now was every one in my eyes, that <hi>I</hi> thought to be converted men and women? they shone, they walked like a people that carried the broad Seal of Heaven about them. Oh <hi>I</hi> saw the lot was fallen to them in pleasant places, and they had a goodly heritage. But that which made me sick, was that of Christ, in Mark, <hi>He went up into a Mountain, and called to him whom he would, and they came unto him,</hi> Mark 3.13.</p>
            <p n="62">62. This Scripture made me saint and fear, yet it kindled fire in my Soul. That which made me fear, was this, lest Christ should have no liking to me, for he called <hi>whom he would.</hi> But on the glory that <hi>I</hi> saw in that condition, did still so engage my heart, that <hi>I</hi> could seldome read of any that Christ did call, but <hi>I</hi> presently wished, Would <hi>I</hi> had been in their cloaths, would <hi>I</hi> had been born <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:93900:16"/>
would <hi>I</hi> had been born <hi>John,</hi> or would <hi>I</hi> had been by, and had heard him when he called them, how would <hi>I</hi> have cryed, O Lord, call me also! but oh <hi>I</hi> feared he would not call me.</p>
            <p n="63">63. And truly the Lord let me goe thus many months together, and shewed me nothing, either that I was already, or should be called hereafter. But at last, after much time spent, and many groans to God, that I might be made partaker of the holy and heavenly calling, that word came in upon me, <hi>I will cleanse their blood that</hi> I <hi>have not cleansed, for the Lord dwelleth in Zion.</hi> Joel 3.21. These words I thought were sent to encourage me to wait still upon God, and signified unto me, that if I were not already, yet time might come I might be in truth converted unto Christ.</p>
            <p n="64">64. About this time <hi>I</hi> began to break my mind to those poor people in <hi>Gedford,</hi> and to tell them my condition: which when they had heard, they told <hi>Mr. Gifford</hi> of me, who himself also took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to talke with me, and was willing to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of me, though I think but from little grounds; but he invited me to his house, where I should hear him confer with others about the dealings of God with the Soul: from all which I still received more conviction, and from that time began to see something of the vanity and inward wretchedness of my wicked heart, for as yet I knew no great matter therein, but <hi>now</hi> it began to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered unto me, and also to worke at that rate for wickedness as it never did before. Now I evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found, that lusts and corruptions would strongly put forth themselves within me, in wicked thoughts and desires, which <hi>I</hi> did not regard before: my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires also for heaven and life began to fail; I found also, that whereas before my Soul was full of long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ngs after God, now my heart began to hanker after
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93900:17"/>
every foolish vanity; yea, my heart would not be moved to mind that that was good, it began to be careless both of my Soul and Heaven; it would now continually hang back both to, and in every duty, and was as a clog on the leg of a Bird to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her from flying.</p>
            <p n="65">65. Nay, thought I, now I grow worse and worse, now am I further from conversion then ever <hi>I</hi> was before; wherefore, <hi>I</hi> began to sink greatly in my Soul, and began to entertain such discouragement in my heart, as laid me as low as Hell. If now <hi>I</hi> should have burned at a stake, I could not believe that Christ had love for me. Alas, I could neither hear him, nor see him, nor feel him, nor savor any of his things: I was driven as with a Tempest, my heart would be unclean, the <hi>Cananites</hi> would dwell in the Land.</p>
            <p n="66">66. Sometimes I would tell my condition to the people of God; which when they heard, they would pity me, and would tell me of the Promises; but they had as good have told me that <hi>I</hi> must reach the Sun with my finger, as have bidden me receive or relie upon the Promise, and as soon I should have done it, all my sence and feeling was against me, and I saw I had a heart that would sin, and lay under a Law that would condemn.</p>
            <p n="67">67. (These things have often made me think of that Child which the Father brought to Christ, <hi>Who while he was yet a coming to him, was thrown down by the Devil, and also so rent and torn by him, that he lay and wallowed foaming:)</hi> Luke 9.42.

            <p n="68">68. Further, in these dayes I should find m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

bitter sigh cried, Good Lord break it open; <hi>Lord break these gates of brass, and cut these bars of iron asunder.</hi> Yet that Word would sometime create in my heart a peaceable pause, I <hi>girded thee, though thou hast not known me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="69">69. But all this while, as to the act of sinning, <hi>I</hi> never was more tender then now; <hi>I</hi> durst not take a pin or a stick, though but so big as a straw; for my conscience now was sore, and would smart at every touch: I could not now tell how to speak my words for fear <hi>I</hi> should mis-place them: O how gingerly did <hi>I</hi> then go, in all <hi>I</hi> did or said! <hi>I</hi> found my self as on a miry bog, that shook if <hi>I</hi> did but stir, and as there left both of God, and Christ, and the Spirit, and all good things.</p>
            <p n="70">70. And though <hi>I</hi> was thus troubled and tossed and afflicted with the sight and sence and terrour of my own wickedness, yet <hi>I</hi> was afraid to let this sence and sight go quite off my minde: for <hi>I</hi> found that unless guilt of Conscience was taken off the right way, that is, by the Blood of Christ, a man grew rather worse for the loss of his trouble of minde, than better. Wherefore if my guilt lay hard upon me, then <hi>I</hi> should cry that the Blood of Christ might take it off: and if it was going off without it (for the sence of sin would be sometimes as if it would die, and go quite away) then <hi>I</hi> would also strive to fetch it upon my heart again, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the punishment for sin in Hell-fire upon my Spirit; and should cry, <hi>Lord, let it not go off my heart but the right way, but by the Blood of Christ, and by the application of thy mercy thorow him to my Soul</hi>; for that Scripture lay much upon me, <hi>Without shedding of Blood there is no Remission,</hi> Heb. 9.22. And that which made me the more afraid of this, was, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>I</hi> had seen some, who though when they were under Wounds of Conscience, then they

they came in, <hi>I</hi> said thus in my heart, What shall <hi>I</hi> get by thinking on these two words? this thought had no sooner passed thorow my heart, but the words began thus to kindle in my Spirit, <hi>Thou art my Love, thou art my Love,</hi> twenty times together; and still as they ran thus in my minde, they waxed stronger and warmer, and began to make me look up; but being as yet between hope and fear, I still replied in my heart, <hi>But is it true too? but is it true</hi>? at which that sentence fell in upon me, <hi>He wist not that it was true which was done unto him of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,</hi> Act. 12.9.</p>
            <p n="74">74. Then I began to give place to the Word, which with power did over and over make this joyful sound within my Soul, <hi>Thou art my Love, thou art my Love, and nothing shall separate thee from my love</hi>; and with that <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.39. came into my minde. Now was my heart filled full of comfort and hope, and now I could believe that my sins should be forgiven me; wherefore I said in my Soul with much gladness, Well, I would I had a pen and ink here, I would write this down before I go any further, for surely I will not forget <hi>this,</hi> forty years hence; but alas! within less then forty days I began to question all again.</p>
            <p n="75">75. Yet still at times, I was helped to believe that it was a true manifestation of Grace unto my Soul, though <hi>I</hi> had lost much of the life and savou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of it. Now about a week or fortnight after this, I was much followed by this Scripture, <hi>Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you,</hi> Luk. 22.31. and sometimes it would sound so loud within me, yea, and as it were call so strongly after me, that once above all the rest, I turned my head over my shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thinking verily that some man had behind me called to me, being at a great distance.</p>
            <p n="76">76. But so follish was <hi>I,</hi> and ignorant, that I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93900:19"/>
knew not the reason of this sound, (which as I did both see and feel soon after, was sent from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as an alarm to awaken me to provide for what was coming) onely it would make me muse, and wonder in my minde to think what should be the reason that this Scripture, and that at this rate, so often and so loud, should still be sounding and rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in mine ears. But, as I said before, <hi>I</hi> soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perceived the end of God therein.</p>
            <p n="77">77. For about the space of a month after, a very great storm came down upon me, which handled me twenty times worse then all <hi>I</hi> had met with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: it came stealing upon me, now by one piece, then by another; first all my comfort was taken from me, then darkness seized upon me; after which, whole flouds of Blasphemies, both against God, Christ, and the Scriptures, was poured upon my spirit, to my great confusion and astonishment. These blasphemous thoughts were such as also, stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up questions in me against the very <hi>being</hi> of God, and of his onely beloved Son; as whether there were in truth a God or Christ, or no? and whether the holy Scriptures were not rather a Fable and cunning Story, then the holy and pure Word of God?</p>
            <p n="78">78. The Tempter also would much assault me with this: How can you tell but that the Turk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:93900:19"/>79. Sometime I have endeavoured to argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these suggestions, and to set some of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of blessed <hi>Paul</hi> against them; but alas! I quickly felt when I thus did, such arguings as these would return again upon me; Though we made so great a matter of <hi>Paul,</hi> and of his words, yet how could I tell but that in very deed, he, being a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and cunning man, might give himself up to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with strong delusions, and also take both that pains and travel to undo and destroy his fellows.</p>
            <p n="80">80. These suggestions (with many other which at this time I may not, nor dare not utter, neither by word nor pen) did make such a seizure upon my spirit, and did so over-weigh my heart, both with their number, continuance, and fiery force, that <hi>I</hi> felt as if there were nothing else but these from morning to night within me, and as though indeed there could be room for nothing else; and also concluded, that God had in very wrath to my Soul given me up unto them, to be carried away with them, as with a mighty whirlwind.</p>
            <p n="81">81. Onely by the distaste that they gave unto my spirit, <hi>I</hi> felt there was something in me that refused to embrace them: but this consideration <hi>I</hi> then onely had, when God gave me leave to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my spittle, otherwise the noise, and strength, and force of these temptations would drown and overflow, and as it were bury all such thoughts, or the remembrance of any such thing. While <hi>I</hi> was in this temptation, I should find often my mind suddenly put upon it, to curse and swear, or to speak some grievous thing of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi> his <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="82">82. Now I thought surely I am possessed of the Devil; it other times again I thought I should be be rest of my wits, for instead of lauding and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

heard him spoken of, presently some most horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blasphemous thought or other would bolt out of my heart against him. So that whether <hi>I</hi> did think that God was, or again did think there were no such thing; no love, nor peace, nor gracious disposition could I feel within me.</p>
            <p n="83">83 These things did sink me into very deep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, for I concluded that such things could not possibly be sound amongst them that loved God. I often, when these temptations have been with force upon me, did compare my self in the case of such a Child whom some Gypsie hath by force took up under her apron, and is carrying from Friend and Country; kick sometimes <hi>I</hi> did, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so scream and cry; but yet I was as bound in the wings of the temptation, and the wind would carry me away. I thought also of <hi>Saul,</hi> and of the evil spirit that did possess him, and did greatly fear that my condition was the same with that of his.</p>
            <p n="84">84. In these days, when <hi>I</hi> have heard others talk of what was the sin against the Holy <hi>Ghost,</hi> then would the Tempter so provoke me to desire to sin that sin, that <hi>I</hi> was as if <hi>I</hi> could not, must not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should be quiet until <hi>I</hi> had committed that; now no sin would serve but that: if it were to be committed by speaking of such a word, then <hi>I</hi> have been as if my mouth would have spoken that word whether <hi>I</hi> would or no; and in so strong a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was this temptation upon me, that often I have been ready to clap my hand under my chin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to hold my mouth from opening; and to that en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that <hi>God</hi> had made, far better then this dreadful state of mine, and such as my companions was: yea, gladly would <hi>I</hi> have been in the condition of Dog or Horse, for <hi>I</hi> knew they had no Soul to perish un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the everlasting weights of Hell for sin, as mine was like to do: Nay, and though <hi>I</hi> saw this, felt this, and was broken to pieces with it, yet that which added to my sorrow, was, that <hi>I</hi> could not finde that with all my Soul <hi>I</hi> did desire deliverance. That Scripture also did tear and rend my Soul in the midst of these distractions, <hi>The wicked are like the troubled Sea which cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt: There is no peace the wicked, saith my God,</hi> Isa. 57.20, 21.</p>
            <p n="86">86. While this temptation lasted, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a year, I could attend upon none of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of <hi>God,</hi> but with sore and great affliction; yea, then was <hi>I</hi> most distressed with blasphemies: if <hi>I</hi> have been hearing the Word, then uncleanness, blasphemies, and despair, would hold me as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive there; if <hi>I</hi> have been reading, then some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>I</hi> had sudden thoughts to question all <hi>I</hi> read; sometimes again my mind would be so strangely snatched away, and possessed with other things, that I have neither known, nor regarded, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred so much as the sentence that but now <hi>I</hi> have read.</p>
            <p n="87">87. In prayer also, <hi>I</hi> have been greatly troubled at this time: sometimes <hi>I</hi> have thought <hi>I</hi> should see the Devil, nay, thought I have felt him behind me pull my cloaths: he would be also continually at me in the time of prayer, to have done, break off, make haste, you have prayed enough, and stay no longer; still drawing my minde away.

Also when because I have had wandering thoughts in the time of this duty, <hi>I</hi> have laboured to compose my mind, and fix it upon God; then with great force hath the Tempter laboured to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract me and confound me, and to turn away my mind, by presenting to my heart and fancy the form of a Bush, a Bull, a Besom, or the like, as if I should pray to those, to these also he would at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times especially so hold my mind, that <hi>I</hi> was as if <hi>I</hi> could think of nothing else, or pray to nothing else but to these, or such as they.</p>
            <p n="89">89. Yet at times <hi>I</hi> should have some strong and heart-affecting apprehensions of God, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the truth of his Gospel: but oh how would my heart at such times put forth it self with unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressable groanings! my whole Soul was then in every word, I should cry with pangs after <hi>God,</hi> that he would be merciful to me; but then I should be daunted again with such conceits as these, <hi>I</hi> should think that <hi>God</hi> did mock at these my prayers, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that in the audience of the holy Angels, This poor simple Wretch doth hanker after me, as if <hi>I</hi> had nothing to do with my mercy, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow it on such as he: alas poor fool! how art thou deceived, it is not for such as thee to have favour with the Highest.</p>
            <p n="90">90. Then hath the Tempter come upon me also with such discouragements as these; You are very hot for mercy, but <hi>I</hi> will cool you; this frame shall not last alwayes; many have been as hot as you for a spirt, but <hi>I</hi> have quench'd their Zeal (and with this such and such who were fallen off, would be set before mine eyes) then <hi>I</hi> should be afraid that <hi>I</hi> should do so too: but, thought I, I am glad this comes into my minde; well, <hi>I</hi> will watch and take what heed <hi>I</hi> can: Though you do, said Satan, <hi>I</hi> shall be too hard for you, <hi>I</hi> will cool you insensibly,

by degrees, by little and little; what care I, saith he, though <hi>I</hi> be seven years in chilling your heart, if <hi>I</hi> can do it at last; continual rocking will lull a crying Child asleep: I will ply it close, but I will have my end accomplished: though you be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot at present, yet if <hi>I</hi> can pull you from this fire, <hi>I</hi> shall have you cold before it be long. These things brought me into great straights; for as I at present could not find my self fit for present death, so <hi>I</hi> thought to live long would make me yet more unfit; for time would make me forget all, and wear even the remembrance of the evil of sin, the worth of Heaven, and the need I had of the Blood of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="91">91. Yet <hi>I</hi> had some supports in this temptation, though they were then all questioned by me: That in the third of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> at the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

sad at the consideration of my many blasphemies; and as I was saying in my mind, What ground have I to think that <hi>I,</hi> who have been so vile and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, should ever inherit eternal life; that word came suddenly upon me, <hi>What shall we say to these things?

            <p n="96">96. At this time also <hi>I</hi> sat under the Ministry of holy Mr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> whose Doctrine, by Gods grace, was much for my stability. This man made it much his business to deliver the People of God from all those false and unsound rests that by Nature we are prone to take and make to our Souls; he pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed us to take special heed, that we took not up any truth upon trust, as from this or that or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man or men, but to cry mightily to God, that he would convince us of the reality thereof, and set us down therein by his own Spirit in the holy Word; for, said he, if you do otherwise, when temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations come, if strongly, you not having received them with evidence from Heaven, will find you want that help and strength now to resist, as once you thought you had.</p>

            <p n="101">101. Also besides these teachings of God in his Word, the Lord made use of two things to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm me in these things, the one was the errors of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and the other was the guilt of sin; for as the <hi>Quakers</hi> did oppose his Truth, so God did the more confirm me in it, by leading me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scriptures that did wonderfully maintain it; and as <hi>I</hi> said, the guilt of sin did help me much, for still as that would come upon me, the blood of Christ did take it off again, and again, and again, and that too, sweetly, according to the Scriptures; O Friends, cry to God to reveal Jesus Christ unto you, <hi>there is none teacheth like him.</hi>

            <p n="106">106. And that was to sell and part with this most blessed Christ, to exchange him for the things of this life; for any thing: the temptation lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me for the space of a year, and did follow me so continually, that I was not rid of it one day i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="108">108. But it was neither my dislike of the thought, nor yet any desire and endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist it, that in the least did shake or abate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation or force and strength thereof; for it did alwayes in almost whatever <hi>I</hi> thought, intermix it self therewith, in such sort that I could neither eat my food, stoop for a pin, chop a stick, or cast mine eye to look on this or that, but still the temptation would come, <hi>Sell Christ for this, or sell Christ for that.</hi>

as continually leaning and forcing my spirit against it, lest haply before I were aware, some wicked thought might arise in my heart that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thereto; and sometimes also the Tempter would make me believe I had consented to it, then should I be as tortured on a Rack for whole dayes together.</p>
            <p n="110">110. This temptation did put me to such scares lest I should at some times, I say, consent thereto, and be overcome therewith, that by the very force of my mind in labouring to gainsay and resist this wickedness; my very Body also would be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to action or motion, by way of pushing or thrusting; still answering, as fast as the destroyer said <hi>fell him,</hi> I will not, I will not, I will not, I will not, no not for thousands, thousands, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of worlds; this reckoning lest <hi>I</hi> should in the midst of these assaults set too low a vallue of him, even until I scarce well knew where <hi>I</hi> was, or how to be composed again.</p>

            <p n="113">113.

            <p n="116">116.

            <p n="117">117. <hi>I</hi> feared therefore that this wicked sin of mine might be that sin unpardonable, of which he there thus speaketh, <hi>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:</hi> And I did the rather give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to this, because of that sentence in the <hi>Hebrews, For y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="118">118. And now began <hi>I</hi> to labour to call again time that was past, wishing a thousand times twice told, that the day was yet to come, when <hi>I</hi> should be tempted to such a sin; concluding with great
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93900:27"/>
indignation, both against my heart and all assaults, how <hi>I</hi> would rather have been torn in pieces, than found a consenter thereto: but alas! these thoughts and wishings, and resolvings, were now too late to help me; the thought had passed my heart, God hath let me go, and I am fallen: <hi>O,</hi> thought I, <hi>that it was with me as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me!</hi> Job 29.2.</p>
            <p n="119">119. Then again, being loth and unwilling to perish, I began to compare my sin with others, to see if <hi>I</hi> could find that any of those that are saved had done as <hi>I</hi> had done. So <hi>I</hi> considered <hi>David</hi>'s Adultery and Murder, and found them most hainous crimes, and those too committed after light and grace received: but yet by considering, <hi>I</hi> perceived that his transgressions were onely such as were against the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> from which the Lord Christ could with the consent of his Word deliver him: but mine was against the <hi>Gospel,</hi> yea, against the Mediator thereof.</p>
            <p n="120">120. Now again should <hi>I</hi> be as if racked upon the Wheel; when <hi>I</hi> considered, that, besides the guilt that possessed me, I should be <hi>so</hi> void of grace, <hi>so</hi> bewitched: What, thought I, must it be no sin but this? must it needs be the <hi>great transgression?</hi> Psal. 19.13. must <hi>that</hi> wicked one touch my Soul, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.18. O what stings did <hi>I</hi> find in all these Sentences!</p>
            <p n="121">121. After this, <hi>I</hi> came to consider of <hi>Peters</hi> sin which he committed in denying his Master; and indeed this came nighest to mine, of any that <hi>I</hi> could find; for he had denied his Saviour as <hi>I,</hi> and that after Light and Mercy received; yea, and that too, after warning given him: I also considered that he did it both once and twice, and that after time to consider betwixt. But though I put all these circumstances together, that if possible <hi>I</hi> might find
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93900:28"/>
help, yet <hi>I</hi> considered again, that his was but <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of his Master,</hi> but mine was <hi>a selling of my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> Wherefore <hi>I</hi> thought with my self, that I came nearer to <hi>Judas,</hi> than either to <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="122">122. Here again, my torment would flame out, and afflict me; yea, it would grind me as it were to powder, to discern the preservation of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, while <hi>I</hi> fell into the snare: For in my thus considering of other mens sins, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them with my own, <hi>I</hi> could evidently see how God preserved them notwithstanding their wickedness, and would not let them, as he had let me, to become a son of perdition.</p>
            <p n="123">123. But O how did my Soul at this time prize the preservation that God did set about his People! Ah how safely did I see them walk, whom God had hedged in! they were within his care, protection and special providence: though they were full as bad as I by nature, yet because he loved them, he would not suffer them to fall without the range of Mercy: but as for me, <hi>I</hi> was gone, I had done it, he would not preserve me, nor keep me, but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me, because I was a Reprobate, to fall as <hi>I</hi> had done. Now did those blessed places that spake of <hi>Gods keeping his People,</hi> shine like the Sun before me, though not to comfort me, but to shew me the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed state and heritage of those whom the Lord had blessed.</p>
            <p n="124">124. Then again, I began to compare my sin with the sin of <hi>

And by considering, <hi>I</hi> found that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> did his intentionally, but mine was against my strivings; besides, his was committed with much, deliberation, but mine in a fearful hurry, on a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93900:28"/>
Thus <hi>I</hi> was tossed to and fro, like the Locusts; and driven from trouble to sorrow; hearing alwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s the sound of <hi>Esau</hi>'s fall in mine ears, and of the dreadful consequences thereof.</p>
            <p n="125">125. Yet this consideration about <hi>Judas</hi> his sin, was for a while some little relief unto me: for <hi>I</hi> saw I had not, as to the circumstances, transgressed so soully as he: but this was quickly gone again, for I thought with my self there might be more ways then one to commit the unpardonable sin; and that too, there might be degrees of that, as well as of other transgressions: wherefore, for ought I yet could perceive, this iniquity of mine might be such as might never be passed by.</p>
            <p n="126">126. Then was I struck into a very great trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, insomuch that at sometimes <hi>I</hi> could for whole days together feel my very body as well as my minde to shake and torter under the sence of the dreadful Judgement of God, that should fall on those that have sinned that most fearful and unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable sin. <hi>I</hi> felt also such a clogging and heat at my stomach by reason of this my terrour, that <hi>I</hi> was, especially at some times, as if my breast-bone would have split in sunder. Then <hi>I</hi> thought of that concerning <hi>Judas, Who by his falling headlong, burst asunder, and all his bowels gushed out,</hi> Act. 1.</p>
            <p n="127">127. I feared also that this was the mark that the Lord did set on <hi>Cain,</hi> even continual fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling under the heavy load of guilt that he had charged on him for the blood of his Brother <hi>Abel.</hi> Thus did I wind, and twine, and sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ink under the burden that was upon me; which burden also did so oppress me, that I could neither stand nor go, nor lie either at rest or quiet.</p>
            <p n="127">127. Yet that saying would sometimes come to mind, <hi>He hath received gifts for the rebellious,</hi> Psal. 68.18. <hi>The rebellious?</hi> thought <hi>I</hi>; Why surely they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93900:29"/>
are such as once were under subjection to their Prince, even those who after they have sworn subjection to his Government, have taken up arms against him.</p>
            <p n="128">128. This sometimes <hi>I</hi> thought on, and should labour to take hold thereof; that some, though small, refreshment might have been conceived by me: but in this also <hi>I</hi> missed of my desire, <hi>I</hi> was driven with force beyond it, like a man that is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the place of execution, even by that place where he would fain c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="129">129. Again, after I had thus considered the sins of the Saints in particular, and found mine went beyond them; then I began to think thus with my self: Set case I should put all theirs together, and mine alone against them, might I not then finde some encouragement? for if mine, though bigger than any one, yet should but be equal to all, then there is hopes: for that Blood that hath vertue enough to wash away all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="137">137. Now also did the Tempter begin to mock
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93900:30"/>
me in my misery, saying, That seeing I had thus parted with the Lord Jesus, and provoked him to displeasure who should have stood between my Soul and the flame of devouring fire, the way was now but one, and that was, to pray that God the Father would be the Mediator betwixt his Son and me, that we might be reconciled again, and that <hi>I</hi> might have that blessed benefit in him that his blessed Saints enjoyed.</p>
            <p n="138">138. Then did that Scripture seize upon my Soul, <hi>He is of one mind, and who can turn him?</hi> Oh I saw 'twas as easie to perswade him to make a new world, a new Covenant, or new Bible besides that we have already, as to pray for such a thing: this was to perswade him that what he had done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready was meer folly, and to perswade with him to alter, yea, to disanul the whole way of salvation; and then would that saying rent my Soul asunder, <hi>Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other Name under heaven, given amongst men, whereby we must be saved,</hi> Act. 4.12.</p>
            <p n="139">139. Now the most free, and full, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words of the Gospel, were the greatest torment to me; yea, nothing so afflicted me as the thoughts of Jesus Christ: for the remembrance of a Saviour, because <hi>I</hi> had cast him off, brought both the villany of my sin, and my loss by it, to mind. O 'tis sad to be destroyed by the grace and mercy of God; to have the Lamb, the Saviour, turn Lyon and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. <hi>I</hi> also trembled at the sight of the Saints of God, especially at those that greatly loved him, and that made it their business to walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually with him in this world: for they did both in their words, their carriages, and all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of tenderness and fear to sin against their precious Saviour, condemn, lay guilt upon, and also add continual affliction and shame un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:93900:31"/>140. Now also the Tempter began afresh to mock my Soul, saying, That Christ indeed did pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty my case, and was sorry for my loss: but for as much as I had sinned, and transgressed as <hi>I</hi> had done, he could by no means help me, nor save me from what <hi>I</hi> feared; for my sin was not of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theirs, for whom he bled and died, neither was it counted with those that were laid to his charge when he hanged on the tree; therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he should come down from Heaven, and die a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new for this sin, though indeed he did greatly pity me, yet <hi>I</hi> could have no benefit of him.</p>
            <p n="141">141. But O how this would add to my affliction, to conceit that <hi>I</hi> should be guilty of such a sin, for which he did not die! These thoughts would so confound me, and imprison me, and tie me up from Faith, that <hi>I</hi> knew not what to do: but Oh thought I, that he would come down again, O that the work of Mans Redemption was yet to be done by Christ; how would I pray him, and intreat him to count and reckon this sin amongst the rest for which he died? But that would strike me down <hi>Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more: Death hath no more D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="142">142. Thus was I always sinking, whatever <hi>I</hi> did think or do. So one day <hi>I</hi> walked to a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Town, and sate down upon a Settle in the Street, and fell into a very deep pause about the most fearful state my sin had brought me to; and after long musing, <hi>I</hi> lifted up my head, but me thought <hi>I</hi> saw as if the Sun that shineth in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens did grudge to give me light, and as if the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry stones the street, and tiles upon the house did bend themselves against me. O how happ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:93900:31"/>143. Then breaking out in the bitterness of my Soul, I said with a grievous sigh, <hi>How can God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort such a wretch as I? I</hi> had no sooner said it, but this returned upon me, as an eccho doth answer a voice, <hi>This sin is not unto death.</hi> At which I was as if I had been raised out of a grave, and cryed out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Lord, how couldst thou find out such a word as this?</hi> For I was filled with admiration at the firness, and also at the unexpectedness of the sentence.</p>
            <p n="144">144. Now I was in hopes that my sin was not unpardonable, but that there might be hopes for me to obtain forgiveness. But O how Satan now di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he could by no means do it, neither this day, nor the most part of the next: for this good sentence stood like a Mill-post at my back. Yet towards the evening of the next day, <hi>I</hi> felt this word begin to leave me, and to withdraw its supportation from me, and so <hi>I</hi> returned to my old fears again, but with a great deal of grudging and peevishness, for <hi>I</hi> feared the sorrow of it.</p>
            <p n="145">145. But the next day at evening, being under many fears, I went to seek the Lord; and as I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>I</hi> cryed to him in these words: <hi>O Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee shew me that thou hast l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="146">146. But yet the Tempter left me not, for it could not be so little as an hund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet God did

bear me up, and keep my heart upon this word, from which <hi>I</hi> had also for several days together very much sweetness and comfortable hopes of pardon. For thus it was made out to me, <hi>I loved thee whilst thou wast committing this sin, I loved thee before, I love thee still, and I will love thee for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="147">147. Yet <hi>I</hi> saw my sin most barbarous, and a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy crime, and could not but conclude, and that with great shame and astonishment, that <hi>I</hi> had hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly abused the holy <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> wherefore I felt my soul greatly to love and pity him, and my bowels to yearn towards him: for <hi>I</hi> saw he was still my friend, and did reward me good for evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, the love and affection that then did burn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, did work at this time such strong and hot desire of revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon my self for the abuse <hi>I</hi> had done unto him, that, to speak as then <hi>I</hi> thought, had <hi>I</hi> had a thousand gallons of blood within my veins, <hi>I</hi> could freely have spilt it all at the command and feet of this my Lord and Saviour.</p>
            <p n="148">148. And as <hi>I</hi> was thus in musing, and in my studies how to love the Lord, and to express my love to him, that saying came in upon me, <hi>If thou, Lord, shouldst mark iniquity, O Lord, who should stand? but there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayst be feared,</hi> Psal. 130.4. These were good words to me, especially the latter part thereof, to wit, that there is forgiveness with the Lord; that he might be feared; that is, as then I understood it, that he might be loved, and had in reverence: for it was thus made out to me. <hi>That the great God did set<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="149">149. And now was that word fulfilled on me, and <hi>I</hi> was also refreshed by it, <hi>Then shall they be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

and confounded, and never open their mouth any more because of their shame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God,</hi> Ezek. 16.36. Thus was my Soul at this time (and as I then did think for ever) set at liberty from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again afflicted with my former guilt and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="150">150. But before many weeks were over, I began to dispond again, fearing lest notwithstanding all that <hi>I</hi> had injoyed, that yet <hi>I</hi> might be deceived and destroyed at the last: for this consideration came strong into my mind, That whatever comfort and peace I thought I might have from the word of the Promise of Life; yet unless there could be found in my refreshment a concurrance and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Scriptures, let me think what <hi>I</hi> will thereof, and hold it never so fast, I should finde no such thing at the end: <hi>For the Scriptures cannot be broken,</hi> John 10.35.</p>
            <p n="151">151. Now began my heart again to take, and fear I might meet with disappointment at the last. Wherefore <hi>I</hi> began with all seriousness to examine my former comfort, and to consider whether one that had sinned as I have done, might with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence trust upon the faithfulness of God laid down in those words by which I had been comforted, and on which <hi>I</hi> had leaned my self; but now was brought those sayings to my minde, <hi>For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for those who were once enlightned and have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God, and the Powers of the World to come; if they shall fall away, to renew th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93900:33"/>
               <hi>Even as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his Birthright; for you know how that afterwards when he would have inherited the Blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with tears,</hi> Heb. 12.</p>
            <p n="152">152. Now was the word of the Gospel forced from my Soul, so that no Promise or Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to be found in the Bible for me: and now would that saying work upon my spirit to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict me, <hi>Rejoyce not, O Israel, for joy, as other People,</hi> Hos. 9.1. for I saw indeed there was cause of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing for those that held to Jesus; but as for me, I had cut my self off by my transgressions, and left my self neither foot-hold nor hand-hold amongst all the stayes and props in the precious Word of Life.</p>
            <p n="153">153. And truly <hi>I</hi> did now feel my self to sink into a gulf, as an house whose foundation is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. <hi>I</hi> did liken my self in this condition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the case of some Child that was fallen into a Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, who though it could make some shift to scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and spraul in the water, yet because it could find neither hold for hand nor foot, therefore at last it must die in that condition. So soon as this fresh assault had fastened on my Soul, that Scripture came into my heart, <hi>This is for many days,</hi> Dan. 10.14. and indeed I found it was so: for <hi>I</hi> could not be delivered nor brought to peace again until well-nigh two years and an half were compleatly fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Wherefore these words, though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they tended to discouragement, yet to me, who feared this condition would be eternal, they were at some times as an help and refreshment to me.</p>

            <p n="155">155. Now while these Scriptures lay before me, and laid sin at my door, that saying in the 18 of <hi>Luke,</hi> with others, did encourage me to prayer: then the Tempter again laid at me very sore, suggesting, That neither the mercy of God, nor yet the blood of Christ, did at all concern me, nor could they help me, for my sin: yet thought <hi>I,</hi> I will pray, but said the Tempter, Your sin is unpardonoble.

            <p n="175">175. First, Because those that have sinned that sin, they are debarred a share in the Blood of Christ, and being shut out of that, they must needs be void of the least ground of hope, and so of spiritual comfort; <hi>for to such there remains no more sacrifice for sin,</hi> Heb. 10.26, 27. Secondly, Because they are denied a share in the promise of Life: they shall never be forgiven, neither in this world nor in that which is to come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.31. Thirdly, The Son of God excludes them also from a share in his blessed intercession, being for ever ashamed to own them both before his holy Father, and the blessed Angels in heaven, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.</p>
            <p n="176">176. When I had with much deliberation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of this matter, and could not but conclude that the Lord had comforted me, and that too af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this my wicked sin: then methought I durst venture to come nigh unto those most fearful and terrible Scriptures, with which all this while I had been so greatly aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93900:37"/>
their visage changed; for they looked not so grimly on me as before I thought they did: And first, I came to the sixth of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> yet trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling for fear it should strike me; which, when I had considered, I found that the falling there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended was a falling <hi>quite away</hi>; that is, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, a falling from, and an absolute denial of, the Gospel of Remission of sins by Christ: for from them the Apostle begins his argument, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3. Secondly, I found that this falling away must be openly, even in the view of the World, even so as to <hi>put Christ to an open shame.</hi> Thirdly, I found that those he there intendeth were for ever shut up of God both in blindness, hardness, and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency: <hi>It is impossible they should be renewed again unto repentance.</hi> By all these particulars, I found, to Gods everlasting praise, my sin was not the sin in this place intended.</p>
            <p n="178">178. Then I considered that in the tenth of the <hi>Hebrews</hi>; and found that the <hi>wilful Sin</hi> there mentioned, is not every wilful sin, but that sin which doth throw off Christ, and then his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments too. Secondly, That must also be done openly, before two or three witnesses, to answer that of the Law, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. Thirdly, This sin cannot be committed but with great despite done to the Spirit of Grace; despising both the disswasions from that sin, and the perswasions to the contrary: But the Lord knows, though this my sin was devilish, yet it did not amount to these.</p>
            <p n="179">179. And as touching that in the twelfth of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> about <hi>Esau</hi>'s selling his Birth-right, though this was that which kill'd me, and stood like a Spear against me; yet now <hi>I</hi> did consider, First, That his was not a hasty thought against the continual labour of his mind; but a thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to, and put in practice likewise, and that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93900:38"/>
too after some deliberation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. Secondly, It was a publick and open action, even before his Brother, if not before many more; this made his sin of a far more hainous nature then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it would have been. Thirdly, He continued to slight his Birth-right: <hi>He did eat and drink, and went his way; thus Esau DESPISED his Birth-right:</hi> yea, twenty year after he was found to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise it still, <hi>And Esau said, I have enough, my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, keep that thou hast to thy self,</hi> Gen. 33.9.</p>
            <p n="180">180. Now as touching this, That <hi>Esau sought a place of repentance</hi>; thus <hi>I</hi> thought: First, This was not for the <hi>Birth-right,</hi> but for the <hi>Blessing</hi>; this is clear from the Apostle, and is distinguished by <hi>Esau</hi> himself, <hi>He hath taken away my Birth-right,</hi> (that is, formerly) <hi>and now he hath taken away my Blessing also,</hi> Gen. 27.36. Secondly, Now this being thus considered, <hi>I</hi> came again to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, to see what might be the mind of God in a New-Testament stile and sence concerning <hi>Esau</hi>'s sin; and so far as <hi>I</hi> could conceive, this was the mind of God, That the <hi>Birth-right</hi> signified <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> and the <hi>Blessing</hi> the <hi>Eternal Inheritance</hi>; for so the Apostle seems to hint, <hi>Left there be any prophane person, as Esau, whose for one morsel of meat sold his Birth-right:</hi> as if he should say, Lest there be any person amongst you that shall cast off all those blessed beginnings of God that at present are upon him, in order to a new Birth, lest they become a <hi>Esau,</hi> even be rejected afterwards, when they would inherit the Blessing.</p>
            <p n="181">181. For many there are, who in the day of Grace and Mercy despise those things which are indeed the Birth-right to Heaven, who yet when the deciding-day appears, will cry as loud as <hi>Esau, Lord, Lord, open to us</hi>; but then, as <hi>Isaac</hi> would not repent, no more will God the Father, but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93900:38"/>
will say, <hi>I have blessed these, yea, and they shall be blessed</hi>; but as for you, <hi>Depart, you are workers of iniquity.</hi> Gen. 27.32. Luk. 13, 25, 26, 27.</p>
            <p n="182">182. When <hi>I</hi> had thus considered these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and found that thus to understand them was not against but according to other Scriptures, this still added further to my encouragement and comfort, and also gave a great blow to that obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to wit, <hi>That the Scriptures could not agree in the salvation of my Soul.</hi> And now remained on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the hinder part of the Tempest, for the thunder was gone beyond me, onely some drops did still remain, that now and then would fall upon me: but because my former frights and anguish were very sore and deep, therefore it did oft befall me still as it befalleth those that have been scared with fire, <hi>I</hi> thought every voice was fire, fire; every little touch would hurt my tender Conscience.</p>
            <p n="183">183. But one day, as <hi>I</hi> was passing in the field, and that too with some dashes on my Conscience, fearing lest yet all vvas not right, suddenly this sentence fell upon my Soul, <hi>Thy righteousness is in Heaven</hi>; and methought withall, <hi>I</hi> saw with the eyes of my Soul Jesus Christ at Gods right hand, there, <hi>I</hi> say, as my Righteousness; so that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>I</hi> was, or whatever <hi>I</hi> was a doing, God could not say of me, He <hi>wants my Righteousness,</hi> for that was just before him. <hi>I</hi> also saw moreover, that it was not my good frame of Heart that made my Righteousness better, nor yet my bad frame that made my Righteousness worse: for my Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness was Jesus Christ himself, <hi>the same yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to day and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13.8.</p>
            <p n="184">184. Now did my chains fall off my Legs indeed, <hi>I</hi> was loosed from my affliction and irons, my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations also fled away: so that from that time those dreadful Scriptures of God left off to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93900:39"/>
me; now went I also home rejoycing, for the grace and love of God: So when I care home, I looked to see if I could find that Sentence, <hi>Thy Righteousness is in Heaven,</hi> but could not find such a Saying, wherefore my Heart began to sink again, onely that was brought to my remembrance, <hi>He is made unto us of God, Wisdom, Righteousness, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and Redemption</hi>; by this word I saw the other Sentence true.</p>
            <p n="185">185. For by this Scripture, I saw that the Man Christ Jesus, as he is distinct from us, as touching his bodily presence, so he is our Righteousness and Sanctification before God: here therefore I lived, for some time, very sweetly at peace with God thorow Christ; O methought Christ! Christ! there was nothing but Christ that was before my eyes: I was not now onely for looking upon this and the other benefit of Christ apart, as of his Blood, Burial, or Resurrection, but considered him as whole Christ; as he in whom all these, and all his other Vertues, Relations, Offices, and Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons met together, and that on the right hand of God in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="186">186. 'Twas glorious to me to see his exaltation, and the worth and prevalencie of all his benefits, and that because of this; Now I could look from my self to him, and should reckon that all those Graces of God that now were green in me, were yet but like those crack'd-Groats and Four-pence-half-pennies that rich men carry in their Purses, when their Gold is in their Trunks at home: O I saw my Gold was in my Trunk at home! in Christ my Lord and Saviour! Now Christ was all; all my Wisdom, all my Righteousness, all my Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and all my Redemption.</p>
            <p n="187">187. Further, The Lord did also lead me into the mystery of Union with this Son of God, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93900:39"/>
I was joyned to him, that I was flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone; and now was that a sweet word to me, in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.3. By this also was my faith in him, as my Righteousness, the more confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to me; for if he and I were one, then his Righteousness was mine, his Merits mine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory also mine. Now could I see my self in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth at once; in Heaven by my Christ, by my Head, by my Righteousness and Life, though on Earth by my Body or Person.</p>
            <p n="188">188. Now I saw Christ Jesus was looked on of God, and should also be looked upon by us as that common or publick person, in whom all t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that I did not, when I was delive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Another cause of this temptation was, That <hi>I</hi> had tempted God; and on this manner did <hi>I</hi> do it: Upon a time my Wife was great with Child, and before her full time was come, her pangs, as of a woman in travel, were fierce and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hen it came into my

mind: for now, though <hi>I</hi> could not suck that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and sweetness from the Promise, as <hi>I</hi> had done at other times, yet, like to a man a sinking, <hi>I</hi> should catch at all <hi>I</hi> saw: formerly <hi>I</hi> thought <hi>I</hi> might not meddle with the Promise, unless <hi>I</hi> felt its comfort; but now 'twas no time thus to do, the Avenger of blood too hardly did pursue me.</p>
            <p n="203">203. Now therefore <hi>I</hi> was glad to catch at that word, which yet <hi>I</hi> feared <hi>I</hi> had no ground nor right to own; and even to leap into the Bosom of that Promise, that yet <hi>I</hi> feared did shut its heart against me. Now also <hi>I</hi> should labour to take the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d as God had laid it down, without restraining the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural force of one syllable thereof: O what did I now see in that blessed sixth of <hi>John, And him that comes to me, I will in no wise cast out</hi>! now I began to consider with my self, that God had a bigger mouth to speak with, than I had heart to conceive with; I thought also with my self, that he spake not his words in haste, or in an unadvised hear, but with infinite wisdom and judgement, and in very truth and faithfulness, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.28.</p>
            <p n="204">204. I should in these dayes, often in my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est agonies, even flounce towards the Promise (as the horses do towards sound ground, that yet stick in the mire) concluding (though as one almost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft of his vvits through fear) on this I will rest and stay, and leave the fulfilling of it to the God of heaven that made it. O! many a pull hath my heart had with Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t (though O how welcome would it have been unto me!) but now a Word, a Word to lean a weary Soul upon, that I might not sink for ever.</p>
            <p n="205">205. Yea, often when I have been making to the Promise, I have seen as if the Lord would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93900:42"/>
upon the pikes, and as if the Lord had thrust at me, to keep me from him, as with a flaming sword. Then I should think of <hi>Esther,</hi> who went to peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the King contrary to the Law, <hi>Esth.</hi> 4.16. I thought also of <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s servants, who went with ropes upon their heads to their Enemies for mercy, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 20.31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that would not be daunted, though called dog by Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the man that went to borrow bread at midnight, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.5, 6, 7, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were great encouragements unto me.</p>
            <p n="206">206. I never saw those heights and depths in grace, and love, and mercy, as I saw after this temptation: great sins do draw out great grace; and where guilt is most terrible and fierce, there the mercy of God in Christ, when shewed to the Soul, appears most high and mighty: When <hi>Job</hi> had passed thorow his captivity, <hi>he had twice as much as he had before,</hi> Job 42.10. Blessed be God for Jesus Christ our Lord. Many other things I might here make observation of, but I would be brief, and therefore shall at this time omit them; and do pray God that my harms may make others fear to offend, lest they also be made to bear the iron yoak as <hi>I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="207">207. Now I shall go forward to give you a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other of the Lords dealings with me, of his dealings with me at sund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I shall begin vvith vvhat I met vvith vvhen I first did joyn in fellowship vvith the People of God in <hi>Bedford.</hi> After I had propounded to the Church, that my desire vvas to vvalk in the Order and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Christ vvith them, and vvas also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by them; vvhile I thought of that blessed Ordinance of Christ, vvhich vvas his last Supper vvith his Disciples before his death, that Scripture
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93900:43"/>
               <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> Luk. 22.19. was made a very precious word unto me; for by it the Lord did come down upon my conscience with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his death for my sins, and as I then felt, did as if he plunged me in the vertue of the same. But behold, I had not been long a partaker at that Ordinance, but such fierce and sad temptations did attend me at all times therein, both to blaspheme the Ordinance, and to wish some deadly thing to those that then did eat thereof; that lest I should at any time be guilty of consenting to these wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fearful thoughts, I was forced to bend my self all the while to pray to God to keep me from such blasphemies; and also to cry to God to bless the Bread and Cup to them, as it went from mouth to mouth: The reason of this temptation I have thought since was, because I did not with that reverence at first approach to partake thereof.</p>
            <p n="208">208. Thus I continued for three quarters of a year, and could never have rest nor ease; but at last the Lord came in upon my Soul with that same Scripture by which my Soul was visited before; and after that, I have been usually very well and comfortable in the partaking of that blessed Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and have I trust therein discerned the <hi>Lords Body</hi> as broken for my sins, and that his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ecious Blood had been shed for my transgressions.</p>
            <p n="209">209. Upon a time I was somewhat inclining to a Consumption, wherefore about the Spring, I was suddenly and violently seized with much weakness in my outward man; insomuch that I thought I could not live. Now began I afresh to give my self up to a serious examination after my state and condition for the future, and of my Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences for that blessed world to come. For it hath, I bless the name of God, been my usual course, as alwayes, so especially in the day of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93900:43"/>
to endeavour to keep my interest in Life to come, clear before mine eye.</p>
            <p n="210">210. But I had no sooner began to recall to mind my former experience of the goodness of God to my Soul, but there came flocking into my mind an innumerable company of my sins and transgressions, amongst which these were at this time most to my affliction, namely, my deadness, dulness, and coldness in holy Duties, my wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings of heart, my wearisomness in all good things, my want of love to God, his wayes and people, with this at the end of all, <hi>Are these the fruits of Christianity? are these the tokens of a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="211">211. At the apprehension of these things, my sickness was doubled upon me, for now was I sick in my inward man, my Soul was clog'd with guilt, now also was all my former experience of Gods goodness to me quite taken out of my mind, and hid as if it had never been, nor seen: Now was my Soul greatly pinched between these two conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, <hi>Live</hi> I <hi>must not, Die</hi> I <hi>dare not</hi>: now I sunk and fell in my Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it, and was giving up all for lost; but as I was walking up and down in the house, as a man in a most woful state, that word of God took hold of my he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rt, <hi>Ye are justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</hi> Rom. 3.24.</p>
            <p n="212">212. Now was I as one awakened out of some trou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lesome sleep and dream, and listening to this heavenly sentence, I was as if I heard it thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to me; Sinner, thou thinkest that because of thy sins and infirmities, I cannot save thy Soul; but b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93900:44"/>
that God could justifie a Sinner at any time, it was but looking upon Christ, and imputing of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to us, and the work was forthwith done.</p>
            <p n="213">213. And as I was thus in a muse, that Scripture came with great power upon my Spirit, <hi>Not by works of righteousness that we have done, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his mercy he saved us,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Tim. 1 9. Tit. 3.5. now was I got on high, I saw my self within the arms of Grace and Mercy; and though I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore afraid to think of a dying hour, yet now I c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ess while I live in this world : <hi>Heirs of God</hi>! God himself is the portion of the Saints: this I saw and wondered at, but cannot tell you what I saw.</p>
            <p n="214">214. At another time, though just before I was pretty well and savoury in my spirit, yet sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there fell upon me a great cloud of darkness, which did so hide from me the things of God and Christ, that I was as if I had never seen or known them in my life; I was also so over-run in my Soul with a senceless heartless frame of spirit, that I could not feel my Soul to move or stir after grace and life by Christ; I was as if my Ioyns were broken, or as if my hands and feet had been tied or bound with chains. At this time also I felt some weakness to seiz my outward man; which made still the other affliction the more heavy and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</p>
            <p n="215">215. Afrer I had been in this condition some three or four days, as I was sitting by the fire, <hi>I</hi> suddenly felt this word to sound in my heart, <hi>I

            <p n="216">216. Then with joy I told my Wife, O now <hi>I</hi> know, <hi>I</hi> know! but that night was a good night to me, I never had but few better; I longed for the company, of some of Gods people, that I might have imparted unto them what God had shewed me: Christ vvas a precious Christ to my Soul that night; <hi>I</hi> could scarce lie in my Bed for joy, and peace, and triumph, thorow Christ; this great glory did not continue upon me until morning, yet that twelfth of the Author to the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore seeing them in both their words and deeds to be so constant, &amp; also in their hearts so earnestly pressing after the knowledge of Jesus Christ, rejoycing that ever God did send me where they were: then I began to conclude it might be so, that God had owned in his Work such a foolish one as I; and then came that Word of God to my heart with much sweet refreshment, <hi>The blessing of them that were ready to perish is come upon me; yea, I caused the widows heart to sing for joy,</hi> Job 29.13.</p>
               <p n="228">228. At this therefore I rejoyced; yea, the tears of those whom God did awaken by my preaching, would be both solace and encouragement to me; for I thought on those Sayings, <hi>Who is he that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me glad, but the same that is made sorry by me</hi>? 2 Cor. 2.2. and again, <hi>Though I be not an Apostle to others, yet doubtless I am unto you, for the seal of my Apostleship are ye in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.2. These things therefore were as another argument unto me that God had called me to and stood by me in this Work.</p>

In my preaching of the Word, I took spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice of this one thing, namely, That the Lord did lead me to begin where his Word begins with Sinners, that is, to condemn all flesh, and to open and alledge that the curse of God by the Law doth belong to and lay hold on all men as they come into the World, because of sin. Now this part of my work I fulfilled with great sence, for the terrours of the Law, and guilt for my transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, lay heavy on my Conscience. I preached what I felt, what I smartingly did feel, even that under which my poor Soul did groan and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I can truly say, and that without dissembling, that when I have been to preach, I have gone full of guilt and terrour even to the Pulpit-Door, and there it hath been taken off, and I have been at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in my mind until I have done my work, and then immediately, even before I could get down the Pulpit-Stairs, have been as bad as I was before.

               <p n="257">257. Before <hi>I</hi> came to Prison, <hi>I</hi> saw what was a coming, and had especially two Considerations w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and tedious; the second was, How to be able to encounter death, should that be here my portion. For the first of these, that Scripture <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. was
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93900:51"/>
great information to me, namely, to pray to God <hi>to be strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness: I</hi> could seldom go to prayer before <hi>I</hi> was imprisoned, but for not so little as a year to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, this Sentence of sweet Petition, would as it were thrust it self into my mind, and perswade me that if ever I would go thorow long-suffering, I must have all patience, especially if I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it joyfully.</p>
               <p n="258">258. As to the second Consideration, that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. was of great use unto me, <hi>But we had the sentence of death in our selves, that we might not trust in our selves, but in God that raiseth the dead:</hi> by this Scripture I was made to see that if ever I would suffer rightly, I must first pass a sentence of death upon every thing that can properly be called a thing of this life, even to reckon my Self, my Wife, my Children, my health, my enjoyments and all, as dead to me, &amp; my self as dead to them.</p>
               <p n="259">259. The second was, to live upon God that is invisible; as <hi>Paul</hi> said in another place, The way not to faint, is <hi>to look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen; for the things that are seen, are temporal; but the things that are not seen, they are eternal</hi>: and thus I reasoned with my self; If I provide onely for a prison, then the whip comes at unawares, and so does also the pillory; again, if I provide onely for these, then I am not fit for banishment; further, if I conclude that banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the worst, then if death come, I am surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; so that I see the best way to go thorow suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, is to trust in God thorow Christ, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world to come; and as touching this world, to <hi>count the grave my house, to make my bed in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to say to Corrup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="263">263. I had also this consideration, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
