            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

myſterie is reuealed to ſuch onely, whoſe eies
the Lorde hath opened, to ſee light in his
light. Therefore ſince we are taught by faith
that whatſoeuer wee haue need of, and is
wanting in vs, the ſame is laid vp with God
for vs in Chriſt: it remaineth that wee ſeeke
it in him, and with prayer craue it of him.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note>
The Apoſtle therefore to ſhewe that true
faith cannot be ſeparate from the inuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21188:10"/>
of Gods holie name, hath ſet this order,
that as faith commeth by the goſpell, ſo by
the ſame faith our heartes are ſtirred vp to
call vpon the name of God, and therefore he
ſaith that the ſpirite of adoption, which ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in our hearts the witneſſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
raiſeth vp our ſpirites that they dare
with boldneſſe ſhew foorth their deſires: it
ſtirreth vpon vs vnſpeakable gronings, and
cauſeth vs to crie with confidence; <hi>Abba
Father.</hi> By the benefit of prayer therfore we
attaine to thoſe riches which God hath laid
vpon ſtore for vs: for thereby we haue fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
acceſſe to God, and boldlie entring into
the ſanctuarie of heauen, we put him in mind
of his promiſes: ſo that now by experience
we feele and finde that to bee true indeed,
which by the word we did before but onely
beleeue: now we inioy thoſe treaſures by
praier, which by faith wee did before but
onelie beholde in the Goſpell of our Lord
Ieſus.</p>
               <p>Now howe neceſſarie and profitable this
exerciſe of praier is, appeareth, in that the
Lord himſelfe witneſſeth our whole ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to conſiſt in the calling vpon his name,
wherby he is whollie preſent with vs: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
by his prouidence &amp; fatherly care by the
which hee watcheth ouer vs: by his power,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21188:10"/>
by the which hee ſuſtaineth and ſuccoureth
our weakneſſe, being euery moment readie
to periſh: and by his goodnes &amp; mercie, by
the which he receiueth vs into fauour, being
miſerably loaden &amp; preſſed downe with ſin.
And hereby groweth ſingular reſt and quier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to our conſcience. For when we haue
diſcloſed to him our neceſſitie, herein wee
finde moſt ioyful and perfect quietneſſe, that
none of our euils are hidden from him, whom
we are perſwaded to bee-both moſt willing
and alſo moſt able to help vs.</p>
               <p>Now that our praiers may be made in ſuch
wiſe as it ought to be, firſt we muſt ſee that
we be in heart and mind no otherwiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
then be commeth thoſe that enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
talke with God, as we are taught, Eccl 28
<hi>Before thou pray prepare thy ſelf, and be not as one
that tempreth God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt conſider therfore when we pray
in whoſe preſence we ſtande, to whome wee
ſpeake and what we deſire. We ſtand in the
preſence of the almightie Creator of heauen
and earth, &amp; all things therin contained: to
whoſe eternall Maieſtie innumerable thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of Angels do aſſiſt, ſerue, and obey: we
ſpeake vnto him, who knoweth the ſecrets of
our harts: before whom nothing is more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thé hypocriſie and diſſimulation: we ask
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21188:11"/>
thoſe things which be moſt to his glory, and
the comfort of our conſciences. We muſt
therefore diligentlie endeuour our ſelues
to remoue all ſuch things as may offende his
diuine Majeſtie. And firſt, that wee be free
from all worldlie cares and fleſhlie cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
wherby our minds are caried hither &amp;
thither, and being drawne out of heauen, and
from the pure beholding of God, are preſſed
downe to the earth.</p>
               <p>And heere let vs call to mind howe vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently
we abuſe the great goodnes of god,
calling vs into familiar talke with him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>h
we haue not that reuerent fear of his ſacred
Maieſtie, that we would haue of an earthly
creature, or a worldlie prince: but ſuffering
our hearts to be carried away with wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
thoughts and worldly imaginations, are
otherwiſe occupied, and forſake him in the
mids of our prayer.</p>
               <p>As God is a ſpirite, ſo will he be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in ſpirite and truth: that is, in the inward
affections of the heart, and with a true, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
&amp; vnfained kind of worſhip. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as at all other times hee requireth the
heart, ſo ſpecially, in the time of prayer, when
we ſhew our ſelues in his preſence, &amp; enter
into communication with him: and therupon
when he promiſeth to heare all thoſe that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21188:11"/>
call vpon him he maketh a reſtraint &amp; ſaith,
that call vpon him in truth. Seeing therfore
that the chiefe dutie of praier conſiſteth in
the heart, we muſt with our whole hart pour
out our prayers vnto God the ſearcher of
hearts, and with a ſyncere, vnfained, &amp; ardent
affection &amp; opening of our heart before god
call vpon him, or els we ſhal not find him.</p>
               <p>Let vs knowe therefore, that none prepare

               <p>Of praier there be two parts, petition and
thankeſguing. By petition we poure foorth
out deſires before God, requiring firſt thoſe
thinges that may ſet forth his glorie, and
then ſuch benefites as are profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
for vs. By giuing of thankes, wee
praiſe and magnifie his benefites beſtowed
vppon vs, acknowledging that whatſoeuer
good things we enioy, we haue receiued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of his free goodnes and liberalitie. Therfore
Dauid ioyned thoſe two partes together in
one verſe, when he ſaith, <hi>Call vpon me in the
day of neceſſitie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> 
                  <hi>I vvill deliuer theeand thou
shalt glorifie me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſcripture commaundeth vs to vſe
both, and that continuallie. For our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is ſo great, our life is ſo full of troubles
and calamities, and ſo many daungers hang
ouer our heades euerie moment, that wee
haue all cauſe ynough, yea, euen the moſt
holie with ſighes and groanings continually
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21188:23"/>
to flie vnto God, and call vpon him in moſt
humble wiſe. But this we may better perceiue
in things pertaining to the ſoule.</p>
               <p>For when ſhal ſo many great ſins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we know our ſelues guiltie, ſuffer vs to be
without care &amp; not to craue pardon of God
for the ſame? when will Sathan giue vs reſt
and quietneſſe? when will he ceaſe to range
about ſeeking whom he may deſtroy? when
ſhall our tentations giue vs truce, ſo that we
ſhall not need to haſten vnto God for helpe?
Finallie, the deſire of the kingdom and glory
of God ought to drawe vs whollie vnto it,
not by fits, but continuallie, that all times
ſhould be fit and conuenient for vs to pray.
Wherefore not without cauſe wee are ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
commaunded to pray continuallie. And
though we be not driuen with like neceſſitie
at all times to praie: yet in this caſe <hi>S,</hi> Iames
teacheth vs what we ought to doe. <hi>If anie
man be heauy or afflicted,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let him praie,</hi>
that is, let him craue Gods helpe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
<hi>and vvho ſo is merrie, let him ſing,</hi> that is,
let him praiſe God.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the benefites and bleſſinges of
God, are large and plentifull towardes vs,
which way ſoeuer we turne vs, that wee can
neuer want matter and occaſion of praiſe
and thankſgiuing. And ſeeing wee ought
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21188:23"/>
to acknowledge God to be the author and
giuer of all good things, we ſhould alway re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the ſame at his hande with thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing:
for to that end God continually beſtow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth
his good bleſſinges and benefits vpon vs
that we ſhould continuallie ſhew foorth his
praiſe, and be thankful vnto him for the ſame
and ſo we render vnto him his due honour.
And S. Paul, when he ſaith, that they are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
by the word and praier, ſignifieth, that
to vs they are not holy and cleane without
the word and prayer, and therefore Dauid
ſaith, when he had felt the liberalitie of the
Lorde, that there was put into his mouth a
newe ſong, that is a new occaſion of praiſe
and thankſgiuing. Whereby he ſignifieth,
that it is a wicked ſilence if we paſſe ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of Gods benefits without praiſe, ſeeing
that as often as he doth good vnto vs, ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
he giueth vs occaſion to ſpeake good of
him. We ſhould therefore continually, that
is, as much as is poſſible, at all times, in all
places, and in things as occaſions are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
offred vnto vs, lift vp our prayer vnto
God in crauing helpe at his hande, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
his praiſe, whereby we may both ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of him all good thinges, and alſo praiſe
and magnifie his name for all.</p>
               <p>Howe this perſeuerance in prayer is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21188:24"/>
of vs, Chriſt himſelfe teacheth vs by
the parable of the three loaues,<note place="margin">Luke. 11 18</note> and of the
widdowe, and wicked Iudge. VVherby wee
are taught to continue in peaier, with all ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtnes

the voyce of my vveeping, the lorde hath hearde
my humble petition, the lorde hath receiued my
praier.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the forme and manner
of praying, leaſt wee ſhoulde followe our
owne fantaſie, being of our ſelues ſo blinde
that wee knowe not howe to praye, or what
is meet and expedient for vs: The Lord him
ſelfe hath ſufficientlie inſtructed vs: who
as he hath taught vs throughout the whole
Scripture, howe and for what thinges wee
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21188:24"/>
ought to pray, ſo hath he ſet foorth one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of prayer, in the which he hath brieflie
comprehended all ſuch thinges as we ought,
yea, or in anie wiſe may aske of God.
VVherein hee hath expreſſed what is due,
pleaſing and acceptable to him, what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
for vs, and what he will grant: ſo
that there is nothing heerein omitted, that
might be thought vpon to the praiſe &amp; glory
of God, or come into the mind of man for his
profite and commoditie. And this is that
praier that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt taught his
Diſciples: when they asked of him how they
ſhould praie.</p>
               <p>VVhoſoeuer therefore ſhall ask any thing
that is not contained in this praier, they
preſume to adde ſome thing of their owne
to the wiſedome of God, they are not obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to his will:<note place="margin">Mat. 9.</note> and they pray without faith,<note place="margin">Luke. 11.</note>
hauing no word of God to warrant them, and
therefore they shall obtaine nothing. This
praier, ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> is the doctrine of the
wiſedome of God, wherein he hath taught
whatſoeuer hee willed, and willed whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
was needfull. Albeit wee are not ſo
bounde to this forme of praier, that wee
should not vſe anie other kinde of wordes
then the Lord himſelfe heerein hath vſed.
For there are elswhere ſet forth in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21188:25"/>
manie prayers farre differing from this
in words, and yet written by the ſame ſpirit,
and verie profitably to be vſed of vs. And ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
prayers alſo are continuallie vttred of the
faithful by the ſame ſpirit, which vary from
the ſame in wordes. But this is required of
vs, that none ſhuld look for, ſeek or ask anie
other thing at all, then that which is brieflie
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended in this praier, &amp; which, though
it differ in words, yet differeth not in ſenſe &amp;

which do continually proceed from the hart
of the faithful are referred by the direction

               <p>In the meane ſeaſon, this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of grace is miraculouſly and
mightiely propagated, enlarged, and
gonerned by the true Miniſterie of
thy woord and ſacramentes, through
the working of thy holy ſpirit: and
this is the meane and waie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
as thou didſt firſt plant, ſo doeſt
thou enlarge, amplifie, and preſerue

               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:21188:49"/>
This kingdome of grace begunne,
continued, and inlarged by the true
preaching of thy Goſpell, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of thy Sacramentes, is the
thing which Chriſt teacheth here thy
children to pray for, that it might
come, that is to ſay, that thy Goſpel
might ſo mightily, purelie, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſlie
bee preached (maugre the
heade of all thine enemies) that the
number of thine electe might bee
brought in, and ſo the kingdome of
thy glorie might appeare. So that
as I ſee thy children deſire, pray, and
labour that thy Goſpell might bee
trulie preached, hearde, and liued in
themſelues and in others: ſo they
lament the not preaching and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the not lining and not beleeuing
thy Goſpell: yea, they lament the
lingring of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comming of thy Chriſt:
for in his comming they know they
ſhall be like vnto him, and hauing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21188:49"/>
this hope, they purifie themſelues as
he is pure. By reaſon heereof I ſee,

haue: I ſee my ignorance of thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

thy grace in thy Church only, and of
thy glory when al the enemies of thy

glorie and power ſhall embrace each

a ſeruice to thee is the true

to haue placed this petition next to
the petition of the ſanctifying of thy

               <p>Againe, I ſee heere mine vnable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neeſſe

               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:21188:50"/>
Thirdlye, I ſee my peruerſity and

woulde not deſire thy kingdome to

               <p>So that I haue great cauſe to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

thou wouldeſt haue thy children to

why anie are ouercome and led into

not teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pray. Suffer vs not
to be led, but lead vs not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that (I ſay) they might only
feare thee, and certainly know that

               <p>Occaſions to euil are in two

But (as I ſaide) if a man bee
left alone, tentations entice euen to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21188:61"/>
the diuel himſelfe: and therefore
thy children praye to bee deliuered
from euill, vnderſtanding thereby
Sathan himſelfe, the ſower of and
ſupporter of all euill. And this thy
children do as well for others, as for
themſelues. So that I may learne
heereby many good thinges: Firſt to
remember often our infirmitie and
weakeneſſe, &amp; the daungerous eſtate
wee ſtand in, in reſpect of our fleſhe,
of the worlde which is full of euil, of
Sathan which ſeeketh to ſift vs, and
as a roaring Lion to deſtroy vs, and
of our ſinnes which deſerue al kinde
of puniſhments and correction, that
I might with thy children feare
thee, watch, pray, and deſire the daye
of redemption and deliueraunce from
all euils.</p>
               <p>Againe, I may learne heere, that
to auoide all daungers and euils, is
not in the power of man, but onelie
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21188:61"/>
thy worke. By reaſon whereof, I
ſhoulde conſider thy great goodneſſe,
which hitherto haſt kept me from ſo

               <p>Thirdly, I may learne heere that

               <p>Laſt of all, I am taught thereby to

will deliuer mee from euill, and

a thing, that God by his iuſtice

deſtruction of the ſoule, which woulde
cut thee off from God thy Sauiour, and

our cecitie or blindneſſe, and corrupt
affections doe often ſhadow the ſight
of Gods ſeede in Gods children, as
though they were plaine reprobates.
Whereof it commeth that they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to their ſenſe, but not
according to the trueth, deſire of God
to giue them againe his ſpirite, as
though they had loſt it, and hee had

he holdeth his hand vnder his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

And this is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Gods children, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate

Chriſt, and the wicked caſt awayes:
that the elect lie not ſtill continuallie

(I meant Gods children) God hath
made all things in Chriſt Ieſu: to
whome hee hath giuen this dignity,
that they ſhould be his inheritance
and ſpouſes. This our inheritour
Chriſt Ieſus, God with God, light
of light, coeternall &amp; conſubſtantiall
with the father and with the holie
Ghoſt, to the end that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
our huſband (becauſe the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band

and fleſh) hath taken our nature vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, communicating with it and
by it in his owne perſon, to vs all
his children, his diuine maieſtie (as
Peter ſaith) and ſo is become fleſh

               <p>For this ende (I meane that wee
might be coupled and maried thus
to Chriſt, and ſo be certaine of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and at peace with God in our

of two men) the one part of Gods
word being proper to the old man,<note place="margin">The law pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the olde man, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to the new man.</note> &amp;
the other part of Gods word beeing
proper to the newe man. The parte
properlie pertaining to the old man
is the lawe: the part properly pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:21188:219"/>
to the new man, is the Goſpell.
The law is a doctrine which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth

               <p>The Goſpell is a doctrine which
