            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16996:3"/>
the Corinths. notwithſtanding that they had beene converted thereby, and the ſygnes of an Apoſtle had bene ſo powerfully wrought by him amongſt them.</p>
            <p>For if the weakenes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie of his fleſh and outward eſtate worldlie, did ſo blind the Corinthians eys that they could not perceave the divine power of Chriſts ſpirit in ſo weake a veſſell, what marveil is it, that ſucceeding ages, and this preſent fleſhlie age, (judging according to the fleſh of ſuch as are far inferiour to Paule in grace) doe not behould that heavenlie power which accompanyeth their miniſtrie.</p>
            <p>The grief of this vanitie were eaſie to be borne if it were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the profane worldlings that did ſo, ſeing <hi>no natural ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is able to diſcern the things of Gods Spirit:</hi>

But its a more lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table error, when it falleth in ſuch as profes the trueth, and doe vphold this miniſtrie, and reape the ſweet and vnſpeakeable fruits thereof, to eſteeme ſo baſelie of that which is the power of God to their ſalvation, if ever they be to be ſaved.

power of his miniſtrie, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of anie ambitious deſire of vaineglorie, but onelie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their edification, that by their contempt of his miniſtrie they ſhould not fruſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the bleſſed fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; even ſo, the faithfull mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt in this age, haue more then juſt cauſe with Paule to ſpeake ſomewhat for themſelves: not vainelie for their owne creditie ſake, but onelie to prevent the like da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger in their hearers, upon the like contempt of their miniſtrie, knowing that the ſame cauſes, ſtill produce the like effects.</p>
            <p>In doeing this; as it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, ſo it ſhalbe ſufficient, to uſe no more Apollogie then is contained in this one verſe of this text. As being the ſtrongeſt argument whereby not onelie
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16996:4"/>
Paule forced the Corinthians to confeſſe the mightie ſtrength of Chriſt in his miniſtrie towards them, but alſo whereby all true and faithfull Paſtors, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the conſcience of their hearers that they are not repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Paſtors. The maine ſcope and force of the Apoſtles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being punctuallie taken up, is this. You Corinthians muſt eyther acknowledge the divine vertue &amp; force of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, or the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye your ſelvs muſt be reprobates? but, wee truſt yee are not reprobates neither will ye have us think ſo, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yee muſt acknowledge the vertue of our miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Thus doth he reduce them to a neceſſitie eyther of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him not to be a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate miniſter, but ſuch an one in whom Chriſt did ſpeake, or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16996:5"/>
then of acknowledging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to bee reprobate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, without faith and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, the evidence of the truth and ſoundnes of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee ſhall (God willing) manifeſt in the particular open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.</p>
            <p>For the cleare vnderſtanding of the Apoſtles meaning wee are firſt to conſider what hath gone before, and how this verſe dependeth or cohereth with the former.</p>
            <p>Two arguments have beene uſed by the Apoſtle to ſhew why he behooved to manifeſt to the Corinthians the authority of his miniſtry, in not ſparing them at his comming againe. The firſt was becauſe they were lawfullie convinced of obſtinacie, having bene now twice or rather thrice admoniſhed, and therefore he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16996:5"/>
behooved to proceed againſt them with ſharpnes, if they did not now repent before his comming, even according to the law of God, which ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that in the mouth of two <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.</note> or three witneſſes everie word ſhall ſtand.</p>
            <p>The ſecond argument was this: They who having felt Chriſt to be mighty in them by my miniſtrie doe yet ſeeke a proof of Chriſt ſpeaking in me, muſt needs haue it in ſharpnes to make them know me to be an Apoſtle of Chriſt; But ye Corinthians do yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your converſion ſeeke an experience of Chriſt ſpeaking in me: Therefore you muſt haue a ſharper proof, ſeeing ye acquieſſe not in that which ye haue alreadie, and reverence not my admonitions given
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16996:6"/>
you upon that proof which ye haue of Chriſts power in me.</p>
            <p>To ſhew yet farther the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of this threatning upon this ground he layeth downe an aſſertion of the power of Chriſt in his miniſtrie towards them, affirming that Chriſt in his miniſtrie towards them was not weak but mighty in them, and therefore this their doing was nothing but a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Chriſts power in him, even as the people of Iſrael in the wildernes after ſufficient proof of the mighty power of God in Moſes by the miracles wrought in Egipt, by leading them ſafely through the redd ſea which overwhelmed their enemies, by the waters given them out of the Rock &amp;c. did (notwithſtanding of all theſe and much more) tempt the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16996:6"/>
Lords power deſiring yet a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence thereof, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them a table in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe and giving them fleſh to eate, as though all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding wonders had been no ſufficient proofe of Gods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power: Even ſo the Corinthians, having had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Chriſt ſpeaking in Paul, by his mighty working in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs: yet for all this did eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme Paul but baſe and weak and his words of no value, and ſo forced him to giue them a ſharper experience of Chriſt ſpeaking in him to their far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grief, if upon this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence paſt they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence his words nor obey his warnings; but would yet tempt Chriſt in him for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof of his power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:16996:7"/>
Now before the Apoſtle prove this which he hath affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med touching the might of Chriſt in them by his miniſtry (perceaving the chief ground and cauſe of this their fooliſh judgment, to be the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and poore eſtate of the Apoſtle in the fleſh) he firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved this errour, and then confirmeth his aſſertion.</p>
            <p>The remooving of this errour is by way of Anticipation, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering that which he knew they ſtumbled at, and might object unto him after this manner: how canſt thou ſhew or wee feare anie might or power of Chriſt in thee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, who art thy ſelf ſo weake in Chriſt and deſtitute of all ſtrength? The Apoſtle anſwereth this by a diſtinction and confirmes it by the like
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16996:7"/>
example in Chriſt himſelf, for he denyeth not ſimplie, but confeſſeth himſelf to be weak in Chriſt, but that this weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was onelie according to the fleſhe, notwithſtanding whereof he was mightie with Chriſt by the heavenlie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power of the ſpirit of God in him, and in this he was like his lord &amp; maſter Chriſt, who as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the fleſh was weak indeed, having taken our nature upon him with all the infirmities therof except ſin, and according to this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe did ſuffer death and was crucified, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding liveth againe by the power of his Godhead, by the which he mightilie rayſed himſelf from the dead. So that even as Chriſt in himſelf was weake in, or according to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16996:8"/>
the fleſhe, and yet was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the ſpiritt or accordinge to his divine nature: ſo alſo his ſervants and meſſengers in him are weake in the fleſh and in all fleſhlie power, but are aliue or mightie with him by the power of his ſpirit in them.</p>
            <p>This conformitie of Chriſts miniſters with Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in fleſhlie weakenes and ſpirituall power is carefullie to bee marked, not onelie againſt the ſacriligious vſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both powers or ſwords by the Pope as Chriſts vicar, but alſo againſt the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which originallie flowing from his practice hath yet too great place in reformed churches? Its Gods will that the meſſengers of his truth <hi>ſhould carie that heauenlie trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>

And even as his baſenes and weakenes in the fleſh made the world to diſpiſe him notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the infinite power of his divine nature: ſo in all ages and now, doe moſt men ſtumble at the weakenes of his miniſters in fleſhlie things belonging to this world, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of the ſpirituall power of Chriſt in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle having thus anſwered their objection, he comes to prooue his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer aſſertion, to wit. That Chriſt in his miniſtry was not weake towards them but was mighty in them, ſo that this their ſeeking of a farther proofe of Chriſt ſpeaking in him was nothing but a ſinfull tempting of Chriſt, and that the proofe which he ſhould
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16996:9"/>
giue them behooved to bee ſharp and bitter vnto them in not ſparing them at his coming. If before his coming they did not reverence his words, and yeald obedience to his admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, upon the proofe bypaſt in themſelves of Chriſts mighty power towards them in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. The argument of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation is drawne from their owne teſtimonies, grounded upon their owne knowledge &amp; experience in themſelves, which teſtimonie the Apoſtle doth forcibly conſtraine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to yeald, by an argument taken from the wofull conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which muſt neceſſarie follow upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, the conſequence being, that if they acknowledg not this experience in themſelves of Chriſts power in his miniſtry toward them, then they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16996:10"/>
muſt be reprobate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but becauſe manie care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſlie and negligentlie do paſſe by the right conſideration and obſervation of the powerfull effects of the miniſtry of the Goſpell in themſelves, and ſo do fall in this ſinne of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, deſpiſing that which they ſhould highlie eſteeme of, the Apoſtle therefore referreth not the proofe of his aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to what they would vnadviſedlie ſay and witneſſe of this might of Chriſt towards them in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, but unto their teſtimonie upon ſufficient tryall and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of themſelves in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he boldlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that they ſhall eyther find his miniſtry powerfull, or themſelves reprobats.</p>
            <p>If then wee will conſider this argument in al the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16996:10"/>
therein contained, there bee 4 things to be marked of us: the 1 is, The tryall and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themſelvs. the 2 is, Theſe things whereof they are to take tryall in themſelves. the 3 is, the argument remooving all excuſe of ignorance, or pretences of impoſſibilities of diſcerning theſe things in themſelves. The 4 is, The argument it ſelf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Apoſtle drawes them to a neceſſitie of acknowledging the power of Chriſt in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry towards them, from the hard conſequence that muſt follow upon the contrarie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ſpeake of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, its neceſſarie that firſt wee marke and conſider the maine points of the Apoſtles doctrine in this place, firſt laying this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that the hearers are true Chriſtians and not repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16996:11"/>
he concludeth abſolutelie that they muſt haue proofe and experience of the mightie pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Chriſt in the miniſtry of thoſe men by whom they are eyther firſt called, or afterward confirmed in grace.</p>
            <p>Thereupon he ſeemeth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to conclude theſe poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons followinge. Firſt where no proofe of Chriſts power in the miniſtry is found or felt by the hearers, eyther the Teacher muſt be a rebrobate Teacher, or the hearers reprobate hearers. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that it is impoſſible, that thoſe who are the elect of God can be without ſence &amp; feeling of Chriſts mightie power unto ſalvation in thoſe who are the true miniſters of the Goſpell. Thirdly, That want of ſence &amp; feeling (in the hearers) of this power of Chriſt in the miniſtry
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16996:11"/>
of his faithfull ſervants, doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently evince ſuch hearers to be reprobates. Laſtly, That thoſe miniſters in whoſe miniſtry the hearers (being of Gods elect) do find no ſence or evidence of Chriſts power unto ſalvation muſt needs be reprobate mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. For the true miniſtry of <note place="margin">1, <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 24</note> Chriſt Ieſus <hi>is the power of God unto ſalvation to all that are to bee</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>ſaved and is fooliſhnes to none but ſuch as periſh.</hi> And if it bee not the power of God to them that are ſaved; It muſt needs follow, that that mans miniſtry is not of God. Theſe generall poſitions ſhalbe moſt cleare and evident unto us after the expoſition of the 4 former particular points contayned in the Apoſtles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof wee are now to ſpeake. The 1 point is the tryall whereunto the Apoſtle doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16996:12"/>
them, wherein 2 things are ſpecially to be obſerved. The 1 is, the action it ſelfe of tryall or examination. The 2 is, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or perſons whom he willeth them to try. Concerning the action, it is not onely a comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, but alſo a moſt neceſſary duety to be obſerved of every man, before he pronounce ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or paſſe his iudgment upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anie thing, but ſpeciallie upon the things of God, &amp; his worſhip in his ordinances, eyther in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting or admitting, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming or approoving, for hereby wee are preſerved, not onely from that great ſinne of ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and raſh judgement, but alſo from that great follie that falleth in many, of forſaking that which is for our good, and embracing that which is for our hurt, and ſo conſequently are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16996:12"/>
kept from doeing wrong both to our ſelves and others. The truth hereof wee may evidently ſee in theſe Corinthians, who diſpiſed and contemned the bleſſed miniſtry of Paul who was the faithfull Apoſtle of Chriſt, and did reverence and highlie eſteeme the deceitfull miniſters of Sathan, onely becauſe they neglected this examination and tryall, and hereof alſo it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth dayly to paſſe, that many fall in that heavie ſinne wherewith Chriſt upbraided the Iewes ſaying. <hi>I am come in my fathers name and yee receave me not, if another ſhall come in his owne name him ye will receave.</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie therefore are they who follow the direction of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſile Io. <hi>In not beleeving every ſpirit, but trying the ſpirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bee of God or not.

their efficacy and working upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>Moreover this teacheth us another leſſon touching the true courſe of mens tryall in matters ſpirituall, and ſpecially of the vertue and power of any mans miniſtry, it is apparent that the Corinthians did narrowly marke the Apoſtle himſelfe in his outward eſtate, and in his vtterance and eloquence, in all which they externally found nothing in their carnal judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but baſenes, weakenes, and words of no valew, but in the meane time they did not marke the mighty work of that weake ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his ſeeming weake words in their owne harts inwardly, which made them perverſe and ſiniſtrous Iudges of his miniſtry, the vertue and power whereof is not to be diſcerned by ought
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16996:19"/>
that outwardly can bee percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved eyther by the eye in behoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſpeaker, or by the eare in hearing his eloquence, but onely by the inward ſence and feeling of their owne harts and ſpirits. And this ſerves to correct two great vices in our judging, firſt concerninge the perſons, and 2 concerning the matter. Touching the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons its a common vice to bee buſie in taking notice &amp; in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others, but not of our ſelves, whereas our mindes ought to bee ſtill examining our ſelves &amp; not others, for as ſayth the Apoſtle, <hi>who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant hee</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, 4.</note> 
               <hi>ſtandeth or falleth to his owne Lord</hi> and not unto thee, and the ſcriptures of God continually warne us to abſteyn from judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others, and ſtill to judge
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16996:19"/>
and tax our ſelvs, leaſt wee be judged and in judging others to begine firſt at our ſelves, becauſe thereby we ſhalbe the more able to giue righteous judgment of others, for as Chriſt ſayth, <hi>how can a man ſay to his brother let me caſt out a mote out of thine eie, &amp; behould there is a beame in his owne eie.</hi> Mat. 74. For <hi>how ſhall a man ſee to cast out a mote out of his brothers eie unto the time that firſt he hath caſt out the beame out of his owne eie.</hi> For Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 7, 12.</note> ſhewes, that with what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wee judge others wee ſhalbe judged, and with what meaſure wee meat unto others; it ſhalbe meaſured againe to us. Beſides that the judgment of others is not left unto us by the Lord, but reſerved unto himſelf, and therefore the Apoſtle count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it a very ſmall matter to bee <note place="margin">1, <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 3.</note>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:16996:20"/>
judged by the Corinthians or any mans judgment touching his fidelity in his miniſtry, but this Apoſtle earneſtly invites us to judge and examine our ſelvs, and ſheweth to the Corinthians that <hi>if wee judged our ſelves, wee ſhould not bee judged of the Lord</hi> with his temporall plagues; as infirmities, ſicknes, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibidem.</hi> 11, 30, <hi>&amp;</hi> 38.</note> death, by which the Lord did chaſtiſe the Corinthians, for not judging and examining the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs before they did eat of the Lords bodie. And this duety of not judging others but our ſelvs, is the more carefully to bee obſerved by us, becauſe (as we ſhall heare afterwards) every faithfull Chriſtian is able by the ſpirit of God given him, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne of himſelf, &amp; his ſpirituall eſtate aright, but as concerning others, although in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16996:20"/>
of charity wee ought to eſteeme well of all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Chriſt, (yea euen of thoſe with whom wee refuſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe for diſobedience in them whom ſtill according to the rule of the Apoſtle wee are not to eſteeme as enemies, but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh <note place="margin">2, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3, 14 15.</note> as brethren:) yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible knowledge of their eſtate in Chriſt, is only known to God <hi>who only knoweth who is his owne.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2, <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 19</note> The 2. errour, concerning the matter of our judgment is, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by likewiſe corrected, wee ſee and perceaue this to bee a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon folly in men, to looke upon the perſon of the preacher, upon his gifts and utterance, and ſtill to be cenſuring all men, to bee eyther good or bad preachers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they find them to ſatiſfie or diſpleaſe their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their gifts of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16996:21"/>
vtterance, or eloquence and ſo often fall in a wofull er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in contemning the beſt &amp; applauding the worſt, whereas the matter of all true judgment of preaching, conſiſts not ſo much in the matter or utterance of the preacher, as in the power of that which is ſpoken: which power is often wanting in the greateſt both of knowledge and eloquence, and oft yea moſt times accompanieth the moſt ſimple delivery of the truth in men having far leſſe meaſure of the aforeſaid gifts. And this tryall taken from the power of the word heard, muſt needs force every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> back to himſelf, to examine himſelf, if he will know how to judge aright of the preacher, ſeeing his hart &amp; ſoul is the ſubject wherein the vertue &amp; efficacy of all preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16996:21"/>
is to bee found. For he is the moſt powerfull preacher who moſt ſtirrs and mooves the hart of the hearer unto faith and obedience, ſo that a man needs not to go out of himſelf to looke to anie thing but that thats in himſelf, whereby to diſcern whether Chriſt ſpeak or not in the preacher whom he heareth; even as its not ſo much colour or taſt of the wine, or matter of the cup whereout we drink, as the felt virtue in our ſpirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed thereby, wherby the valour and vertue of wine is diſcerned, both colour and taſt though in a golden cup decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us: As in matereall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples built of ſtone, the more the windowes be painted the leſſe is the light: So in the true ſpirituall Temple of Chriſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16996:22"/>
thoſe that are the lights there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the more their preaching be painted with the intiſing words of humane wiſdom and eloquence, the leſſe ſolid light of the knowledge of the glorie of God in the face of Ieſus is miniſtred by them to the harts of their hearers.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16996:24"/>
and ſpecially of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as may be perceaved by the Apoſtles words to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. Cap. 14, ſaying, <hi>One man beleveth that he may eat al things, and another which is weake eateth hearbs,</hi> &amp; againe, <hi>I know and am perſwaded through the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that there is nothing uncleane of it ſelf, but to him that judgeth ought uncleane, to him it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane.</hi> and againe, <hi>haſt thou faith, haue it with thyſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, bleſſed is he that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not himſelf in that which he alloweth, but he that doubteth is condemned if he eate, becauſe he eateth not of faith.</hi> and <hi>what ſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne,</hi> in all which words the Apoſtle attributeth knowledg and full perſwaſion of the indifferent uſe of all externall things as meat drink &amp;c. unto fayth, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16996:25"/>
ignorance &amp; doubting to infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or weaknes of faith which giues us a cleare light to diſcern betwixt man and man in their judgment touching things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in their uſe, where it may be without ſcandall. And abſtinence from them, where the uſe is ſcandalous: for undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly true faith where it is, giues a man knowledg and full perſwaſion that ther is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt one meate, one garment, or oneday and another &amp;c. in themſelvs: but where one day, one meate, one garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp;c. is eſteemd above another, or where ther is doubting of their indifferency and equall law fulnes in uſe as before, there muſt needs be weaknes of faith, which is a faith accompanied with much infidelity. But leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſence of theſe words,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16996:25"/>
notwithſtanding that it may be probably taken to be the Apoſtles meaning, wee come to the other ſence as being in moſt mens judgment, the true meaning of the Apoſtle, taking the words as a declaration of that wherein they ſhall try themſelues, viz. whether they be in the fayth or no, according to which ſence the Apoſtles argument will follow after this manner. If ye be in the faith, ye muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the power of Chriſt in my miniſtry: But by tryall ye ſhall find that ye are in the faith: Therefore if ye try yourſelvs ye ſhall finde the power of Chriſt in my mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. The confirmation of the ſecond part of this argument viz. That by tryall they ſhall finde themſelvs to be in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16996:26"/>
faith is to be taken from the laſt words of this verſe, which are indifferently to be uſed for prooving both the parts of tryall, that is, both that they are in the faith, and that Chriſt is in them, after this manner, either by tryall you ſhall finde you are in the faith, or that ye are reprobates: But we truſt ye ſhall finde ye are not repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates: Therefore we truſt that by tryall ye ſhall finde yourſelvs to be in the faith.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak then of this firſt thing wherein they are to try themſelvs, we haue two things to be marked in it. Firſt what it is whereabout this tryall muſt be in themſelvs, viz. faith. Secondly, what muſt be tryed concerning this faith, viz. Whether they be in it or not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:16996:26"/>
Touching the firſt, Its not without great reaſon that the Apoſtle ſetts down no other chriſtian vertue whereby to finde out in themſelvs the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall power of Chriſt in his miniſtry towards them but faith, For all other operation of the miniſtry whatſoever, be what it will be, if it haue not faith accompanying it, doth never prove that miniſtry to be the power of God unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thoſe men, for as ſaith the Apoſtle, the Goſpell is the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.</note> power of God unto ſalvation to every one that beleeveth, by which ſort of ſpeech the ſpirit of God will teach us plainely, that the miniſtry of the Goſpell, is not Gods power to ſalvation to thoſe men in whom it neuer begetteth faith, ſo that if any will rightly try
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16996:27"/>
himſelf whether the miniſtry of men, be accompanyed with the power of Chriſt ſpeaking in them to his ſalvation, he is not to looke ſo much to any effect thereof in himſelf as to this vertue of fayth, for all other effects may deceaue him as doubtleſſe they doe many, for experience teacheth, that the Goſpell and preaching thereof doth work many great effects even in the reprobate, as wee ſee in Herod, <hi>who feared Iohn the Baptist and heard him gladly, and</hi>

And its manifeſt by the parable of Chriſt in the Goſpell that <hi>the kingdome of heaven is like a draw net caſt into</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>the ſea that gathereth of all kinde of things.</hi> But as the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>all men haue not faith.</hi> 2, Theſ. 3, 2. <hi>For many are called but few are choſen, nether every</hi>

            <p>Its evident by dayly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that the Goſpell worketh effectually in many to their conviction, and in many alſo to their externall converſion, &amp; outward profeſſion of the true God, and unto obedience in many things, in whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it neuer wrought true juſtifyng faith, whereby its evident that there is no tryall ſound &amp; infallible to any man, of Chriſts ſaving power by the miniſtry of the Goſpell toward them, except that which is taken from faith; our devotion,

zeale, holines, profeſſion and obedience, will miſerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue us, if wee buyld our truſt on them, for it is not they, but faith alone, that makes us the ſonnes of God and truely juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth us, yea which is more, euen they all are ſinnes, if faith be not theyr fountain, <hi>for what ſoever is not of faith is ſinne.</hi> The <note place="margin">

This doth argue both preaching and hearing of manie to bee vaine &amp; fruitles, whenas eyther is not chiefly intended to this end of beleeving, for if a teacher work not faith by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, whatſoever hee doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſhall neuer ſaue the hearers. And if a man by hearing, attain not to beeleeving, what ever other fruit he receaue ſhal but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his judgment, for faith wrought by preaching is the true touchſtone, whereby both a preacher is tryed to haue Chriſts power in his miniſtry, and a hearer doth finde the Goſpell to bee the power of God to his

ſalvation. Now wee come to the next touching their being in this faith.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16996:32"/>
unto ſalvation but faith onely, within the compaſſe &amp; limits whereof, except he remaine encloſed, he cannot avoyd evill, therefore is it that the Apoſtle chargeth every one in the houſe of God, that <hi>no man</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3.</note> 
               <hi>preſume to bee wiſe aboue that which is meete, but that every man bee wiſe unto ſobriety, as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of faith,</hi> this meaſure of every mans faith being unto him the onely rule and juſt meaſure, both of his actions and ſufferings, ſeeing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne, for which cauſe the Apoſtle defines the life of a Chriſtian, <hi>to bee the life of faith in the ſonne</hi> of God. Galatians 2. 20. Therefore for the better keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves from all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of ſathan, wee are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16996:33"/>
               <hi>to put on, as an armour given us from God, theſe Chriſtian vertues, truth, righteouſnes, peace hope, and aboue all faith, whereby wee may be able to quench all the ſiery darts of the diuell, &amp; to ſtand againſt all his aſſaults.</hi> Epheſians 6, 10, 11. And in another place wee are exhorted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>as the elect of God (holy and belooved) to put on the bowells of mercies, kindnes, humblenes of mind, meekenes, long-ſuffering, loue, &amp;c. And finally whatſoeuer wee ſhall doe in word or deed to doe all in the name of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> which is aſmuch as to will us to doe al in faith. Coloſſians 3, 12, &amp;c. For as God doth not exerciſe his power in us to the praſtiſe of good but by faith: So doth he not imploy his power to keepe us unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but by faith alſo: as is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16996:33"/>
plaine by the words of Peter ſaying, <hi>that wee are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation.</hi> 1, Ep. 1, 5. Thus faith is both the power of God within us, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then us to all goodnes, and the armour of God upon us, to keepe and couer us from all evill. For which cauſe, as wee muſt abide in Chriſt, and Chriſt muſt abide in us unto ſalvation: So muſt wee alſo abide in faith, and faith in us, ſince Chriſt is neither in us; nor wee in him, nor liue wee in him, nor he in us, neither keepeth hee us, nor wee him, except by faith aloue.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſon why the Apoſtle doth not will us to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry if faith be in us, but rather if wee bee in the faith, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16996:34"/>
both bee not neceſſary, or that the one can poſſibly bee without the other, ſeeing the union betwixt us and the graces of God in Chriſt, is like to our communion with Chriſt himſelf, for as he is in us and we are in him, ſo are wee in his graces and gifts and they are in us; even as he is in the father and the father in him, but the cauſe moouing the Apoſtle to ſpeak ſo is this, becauſe our finding of our ſelves in the faith is the moſt cleare evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the power of Chriſt in the miniſtry to our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for then it is effectuall when not onely, it doth work faith in our hearts; but alſo doth make us walke in it, ſo that as in our knowledge will or affection inwardly; even
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16996:34"/>
ſo in our deeds externally, we manifeſt this faith. Not going in any thing beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the meaſure of that faith which God hath given us, and to ſpeake the truth it is a wofull error in many Chriſtians to ſatiſfie themſelvs with a conceyt, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, without marking, or once conſidering, whether they haue put on this faith, as a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to walk in, and as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to fight in, that they may ſee themſelves in it cloathed both as their garment and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orning them, and as an armour defending them, for its many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the doctrine of Iames, that many boaſt they haue faith who yet doe not walke in it, nor uſe it as a ſhield againſt ſin and ſathan, therefore wee are never to eſteeme the miniſtry of the Goſpell to bee the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16996:35"/>
power of God to our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for any light or perſwation it worketh in our hearts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, excepte likewiſe it make us put on that light to walke in it as the children of light, and arme us with it to fight againſt the prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and all his works; For, ſcripture and experience teach us, that manie haue the lighte of the knowledg and truth of God within them, boaſting of it in words, who yet in their deeds deny it, doing as the Apo. ſpeaks of the gentils <hi>who held and detained the truth in unrighteouſnes, and ſuppreſt it in their hearts, becauſe when they knew God they glorified him not as God, neither were thankfull. Rom. 1. 18. &amp; 21.</hi> And thus much for the firſt point of the tryall: we ſhould now ſpeake of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16996:35"/>
but that the Apoſtle doth ſtay us with an argument preventing an objection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſpecifieth the ſecond point of tryall, which is the mean to know the former, for they might haue ſaid, how ſhall we be able to know theſe things which thou willeſt us to try either that which goeth before, viz. Whether we be in the faith: or that which followeth, viz. whether Chriſt be in us?</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle to take away this pretence of ignorance and ſo to enforce them to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg by this tryall of themſelvs the power of Chriſt in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry towards them, doth uſe this argument. You muſt ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by tryall perceave theſe things in your-ſelvs being chriſtians: or then ye knowe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16996:36"/>
not your ſelves; but its abſurd that you Chriſtians, ſhould not know your ſelves, therefore you may eaſily try theſe things in your ſelves. Of argument wee haue no more ſet downe but the ſecond part, yet ſo as in the manner of ſpeech he leadeth us to the collection and gathering of the reſt, the words being theſe <hi>know ye not your ſelves,</hi> as if he would ſay this, wherein I will you to examine your ſelves can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hid from you if ye know your ſelves? which knowledge of themſelves, he inforceth upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them by this his interrogation, which implyeth as much, as that it was not only a ſhame to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo an impoſſible thing not to know themſelvs, &amp; ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuateth the concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to wit, that therefore they behooved to know theſe things where in he
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16996:36"/>
willd them to try themſelves. In this forme of the Apoſtles proceeding, wee haue firſt to learne, what backwardnes and untowardnes lurks in our nature ſtil, in that wee are loath to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any thing whereby wee ourſelvs may be convinced, except confeſſion bee wreſted from us by forcible and unreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable argument, wee being ſtill inclind to uſe all ſort of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to excuſe, and amongſt the reſt, ignorance rather, then by ſimple acknowledgment of the known truth, to condemne our ſelves in any thing. This vice did evidently appeare in Cain, when God inquired where his brother Abell was, who, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he knew perfectly, he had kild him, yet uſed a ſhifting anſwere to the Lord, firſt pretending ignorance, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16996:37"/>
then bringing in an argument to convince God of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes in requiring ſuch a-thing at his hand; in that he ſaid, <hi>he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 4, 9.</note> 
               <hi>was not his brothers keeper,</hi> the like wee ſee alſo in Saul when he was accuſed by Samuell for ſparing Agag the King of Ameleck in ſtrongly affirming he had performed the will of the Lord, notwithſtanding that he knew that the preſerving of Agag aliue and reſerving of the beſt of the ſpoile, was direct contrary to the direction of the Lord, whereby he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>to ſmite Ameleck, and to deſtroy all that pertained unto them, but to ſtay both man and woman, both infant and ſuckling, both oxe and ſheepe, both Camell and aſſe.</hi> 1. Samuel 15. The ſame alſo is cleerly to bee marked in Annanias and Saphira Acts. 5.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16996:37"/>
And this ſame infirmity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth here in the Corinthians although not in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor meaſure of inquity: In Cain, Saul, Ananias and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira, it proceeded from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and unſanctified hearts filled with malice, pride, and coveteouſnes, but in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians (as in other Godly men) it falleth through infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and negligence, but never of obſtinate malice or contempt, yet ſtill to bee acknowledged a great weakenes, having always mixt with it ſome ſelfloue of our ſelvs, which makes us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſſemble a knowne truth, then to diſgrace our ſelvs, in any ſort, but leaving this, wee come to thoſethings which principally are to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in this argument of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, which yealds us two
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16996:38"/>
things to our conſideration, the firſt is, that a Chriſtian who is caled out of darknes to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous light of God, hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all others, this great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that his eies are open to know himſelf, which no man can doe, till he be effectually called of God, and haue receaved the ſpirit of truth, whereby he is made able to diſcerne all things, this knowledge of our ſelvs was known to bee a great vertue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the very heathen, and was propounded to be followed as a ſingular vertue by the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, but never any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could ever attaine to it, it being the ſpeciall prerogative of thoſe who are taught by the truth of God revealed in his word, to haue this grace to know themſelves, according to that ſaying of Iohn, <hi>wee know that</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:16996:38"/>
               <hi>wee are of God &amp; this whole world lyeth in wickedneſſe.</hi> Iohn 1 Epiſt. 5, 19. And therefore is it that the ſame Apoſtle ſayth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the elect, <hi>that the annointing which they haue receaved of the father dwelleth in them, and that they need not that any man teach them, but as the ſame annointing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2, 27</note> 
               <hi>teacheth them of all things, and it is true and not lying.</hi> The 2. thing which hereby wee learne is this. That the calling of God to the knowledg of his truth, giues to men (in the knowledg of themſelves) the ſight and knowledge of all graces that are given them of God, according to that ſaying of the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the unſearchablenes of the things which God hath prepared for them that loue him <hi>but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God hath reveyled them unto us by his ſpirit, for wee</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:16996:39"/>
               <hi>haue not receaud the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of God, that wee might know the things that are given us of God.</hi> 1, Corint. 2, 10, 12. Therefore is it, that Chriſt calles his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>no more ſervaunts but friends, becauſe</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>the ſervant knoweth not what his maſter doth, but vnto them he had made known all things which he heard of his father.</hi> Iohn 15, 15. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place hee ſhewes the reaſon of this knowledge in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as alſo why the world is deſtitute of it (ſpeaking concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſpirit) ſaying <hi>whom the world cannot receaue becauſe it ſees him not neither knowes him, but yee know him, becauſe he dwelleth with you and ſhal bee in you.</hi> Iohn. 14, 17. This place being conferd with the former two, teacheth us 3 ſpeciall things touching
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16996:39"/>
the eſtate of a true Chriſtian. The 1 is, that they are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the things of God, nor of any grace or bleſſing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall given them by God in Chriſt. the 2 is. That all this knowledge is taught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ſpirit of God which is given them, &amp; remaines within them. The 3 that both the gift of this ſpirit and knowledge by him, proceedes from this, that God hath not left us in the world nor in the eſtate of ſervitude &amp; bondage, but hath taken us out of the world, and by reconcyling us to himſelf in Chriſt hath made us his friends as Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was. The uſe of this is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the doctrine of the papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall church of falſhood, whereby they maintaine that a Chriſtian truely called can haue no certaine knowledge whether
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16996:40"/>
he bee in the eſtate of grace or not; for if the Apoſtle urge the Corinthians by this ſpeciall knowledge of their owne being in the faith, and of Chriſts being in them, to bee witneſſes of the power of Chriſt in his miniſtry toward them, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that both they, and all others called as they were, muſt haue vndoubted knowledge of themſelves, that they are in the faith, and Chriſt in them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Chriſts argument before alleadged could not bee true, when he ſaith, that his diſciples did know the ſpirit of truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he dwelt with them and ſhould be in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t teacheth us thus much, that the ſaints cannot bee ignorant of any gift or grace of God which dwelleth with them and is in them, ſo that wee
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16996:40"/>
may Iuſtly concluded that a Papiſt (houlding the former poſition for a truth,) muſt bee both faythles and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſeing if eyther faith or grace were in them they could not be ignorant of them; neither can they haue anie evaſion by their old argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the neceſſitie of ſome ſpeciall revelation from God; For this which we haue ſaid before, compared with the words of Iohn doth fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them, ſaying, <hi>If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the witnes of men the witneſſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. 5. 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.</note> 
               <hi>of God is greater, For this is the witnes of God which he teſtifieth of his ſonne: He that beleeveth in that ſone of God hath witnes in himſelfe.</hi> By which words we are plainly taught, that faith can never be without the teſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imonie both of thoſe three
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16996:41"/>
which beare record in heaven (to wit) the Father, the Word, and the Holy-ghoſt, nor of theſe three witneſſes which beare record in earth, viz. The ſpirit, the water, and the bloud, and therefore that it muſt follow that everie true beleever hath a moſt undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed revelation of his ſalvation, and bleſſed eſtate in grace, and on the contrarie that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath not this vndoubted warrant is faithles indeed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beleeveth in the ſonne of God hath this witnes of the Father, of the Word, and of the Holy ghost, which are in heaven,</hi> &amp; <hi>of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and of the water, and of the blood, which are in earth:</hi> then which there can be no revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of greater force to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the certaintie of ones ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:16996:41"/>
For, if according to Gods owne law <hi>at the mouth of two or three witneſſes every matter</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dent.</hi> 19. 5.</note> 
               <hi>ſhalbe establiſhed,</hi> how much more muſt a true beleeving chriſtian know the certaintie of his ſalvation, who hath it witneſſed vnto him and that within himſelf, by thoſe ſixe witneſſes before mentioned, of which none can lye, and this is ſo much the clearer by that which Iohn in the ſame place ſpeaketh ver. 13, ſaying, <hi>theſe things haue I written unto you, who beleeve in the name of the ſonne of God, that ye may knowe that ye haue eternall life.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he utterly annulleth that blind argument of the Papiſts, ſeing it enforceth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eyther to confeſſe that they know they haue eternal life, or then plainely to confeſſe that they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16996:42"/>
beleeue not in the ſonne of God, for faith and knowledge of ſalvation are two unſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble adjuncts, and ever ſuch knowledge, as is not builded upon a doubtfull opinion or conjecture, but which is buylt upon the unfallible teſtimony of the ſix witneſſes, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned before. Wee conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this point, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable uſe thereof to all true beleeving Chriſtians viz. that they rejoyce always, I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with the Apoſtle that they rejoyce always, ſeeing their ſalvation is ſure, and that its given unto them to knowe that it is ſure.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the Apoſtles argument for remooving of all pretence of ignorance. Now followes the 2 point of tryall, which is, whether Chriſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16996:42"/>
bee in them or not, but its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in another manner then the firſt, for touching faith, he willd them to try if they were in it, but this laſt, he propounds as a thing which he would haue them undoubtedly to acknowledge, and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veil, for the effects are more eaſie to be known then their cauſes; now Chriſt he dwells in our hearts by faith, and therefore wee can never have a true evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that we beleeue, untill we find, that Chriſt is aſſuredly within us, for this cauſe wee ſaid before, that this 2 point of tryall, was the meane to know the former. Moreover the Apo. ſubjoins this point, unto his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer argument, whereby he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooves all pretence of Ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce purpoſely to teach us, both whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and wherein it is, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:16996:43"/>
comes to know himſelf to bee in the faith, and ſo receaves experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the power of Chriſt in the miniſtry of the Goſpell to his ſalvation whereof before wee ſpake, wee will firſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what conſider the order of the Apoſtles words. Wee ſee that in the firſt place he puts them to the tryall of their faith, as being the evidence of the power of Chriſt in his miniſtry toward them to their ſalvation. 2. In this examination he brings them to the acknowledging of themſelves, as the proper effect of true faith in all true beleevers. 3. He brings the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of Chriſts preſence in their hearts, as the onely true teſtimony of the firſt, &amp; proper matter of the 2. For if any man thinks he beleeves, not having Chriſt within him, he is miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:16996:43"/>
deceaved, and if any man think, he knowes himſelf to bee the child of God, except he find himſelf and Chriſt united by faith pittifully abuſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his owne judgment. This order therefore of the Apoſtles proceeding teacheth us this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, what way and by what meanes it is, that wee come to the knowledge of the mighty power and outſtreched arme of God in the miniſtry of his word to our ſalvation, in the which 3, things are principally to be marked. Our faith, our ſelvs, and that in our ſelves which makes us know our ſelves by faith to bee the chidren of God. And ſo by conſequence wherein ſtands the chief proof that the word of God is Gods power to our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in the conſideration of theſe, our faith is the point that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:16996:44"/>
makes the concluſion, For without faith its impoſſible wee can bee, or know our ſelves to bee the children of God. But notwithſtanding that which makes the infallible determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being in the faith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the preſence of Chriſt within us, without which all conceit of having faith is frivolous and vain. The order then of our minds in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching our ſpirituall eſtats is this. 1. Wee are to try and examine our ſelves whether wee know our ſelves to bee of God or no, for he is not of God that knowes not himſelf to bee of God, for according to the ſaying of Iohn <hi>he hath given us a mind to know him which is true, and wee are in him that is true, and wee know that wee are of God.</hi> Iohn 1. Epi. 5. 19. 20. Secondly wee
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:16996:44"/>
are to try if wee bee in the faith, becauſe wee never can know our ſelves to bee of God untill the time wee find ourſelves to bee in the faith, according to the ſaying of Chriſt. <hi>Hee that is of God heareth Gods words, ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heare them not becauſe ye are not of God.</hi> Iohn 8. 47. 3. For confirming our hearts in the knowledge of this. 2. Point, and ſo conſequently in the full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the firſt, wee are to try if Chriſt bee in us, without which wee can never aſſuredly know that wee beleeved, and ſo conſequently that wee are of God, according to the ſaying of Chriſt (ſpeaking of the work of the ſpirit in thoſe to whom he gives it,) <hi>at that day ſhall ye know that I am in my father and you in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 14, 20.</note> 
               <hi>mee and I in you</hi> and againe in his prayer to God for his elect,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16996:45"/>
               <hi>the glory that thou gaveſt mee I haue given them, that they may be one as wee are one, I in them and thou in mee, that they may bee made perfect in one.</hi> Iohn 17. 22. 23. And againe <hi>I haue declared unto them thy name and will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it, that the loue wherewith thou haſt loved mee may be in them and I in them.</hi> Ibidem 17. 26. For which cauſe the ſaincts are called <hi>the habitation of God by the ſpirit.</hi> Epheſians 2. 22. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Apoſtle concludeth that <hi>if any man haue not the ſpirit of Chriſt the ſame is not his.</hi> Rom. 8. 9. And this dwelling of Chriſt by his ſpirit in our hearts is only wrought by faith accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſaying of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Ieſus Christ that he might grant you according to the richnes of his glory, that you may</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:16996:45"/>
               <hi>bee ſtrengthned by his ſpirit in the inward man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by ſaith,</hi> Epheſians 3. 14. 15, 16. 17. By all which it evidently appeares when it is that a man knowes himſelf indeed to be the child of God, and alſo wherein this knowledge conſiſteth, viz. when he comes to a lively feeling and cleare ſight that Chriſt is in him, all other gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whatſoever being of no valew or force in the leaſt to give any aſſurance or true knowledge to a mans ſoule that he is truely and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called by the Goſpell to the eſtate of grace and hope of glory, for then onely it is that the Goſpell becomes the power of God to our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, when as thereby Chriſt is formed in us according to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16996:46"/>
the words of the Apoſtle to the Galatians ſaying <hi>my litle chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of whom I trauell in birth againe untill Chriſt bee formed in you.</hi> Cap. 4. 19. The ſame is confirmed by that ſpeech of the Apoſtle to the Coloſſiaus wherein he diſcribes what is the riches of the glorious miſtery of the Goſpell amongſt the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tills ſaying, <hi>which riches is Chriſt in you the hope of glory.</hi> Cap. 1, 27. The uſe of this is to teach us, that in vaine any man contents himſelfe with any other thing whatſoever, thereby hoping to be ſaved if he haue not Chriſt within him, and that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf know it, for with out him nothing availes to ſalvation, ſynce nothing can make a man the child of God but he aloue, in ſo far that faith it ſelf is not the true faith of Gods elect
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16996:46"/>
whereby the heart is purified, and a ſinner juſtified and ſaved, except that by it Chriſt be brought in, and made to dwell in the heart, and that in ſuch evidency that the beleeving man know that he hath Chriſt within him, for its impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a man can haue Chriſt, but that he muſt know that he hath him, ſuch is the liuely operation and ſupernaturall working of Chriſt in the ſoule where he is, illuminating, quickning, and tranſforming everie man who hath him in the ſpirit of his mind, and in pacifying &amp; comforting the conſcience, and in filling and repleniſhing the ſoule with the ſence of Gods loue, and hope of his glorie that never man could ever more clearely diſcern that hee
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16996:47"/>
hath a ſoule within him by the naturall effects thereof in his bodie; then a chriſtian may perceaue Chriſt to be within him by his proper effects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned.</p>
            <p>Out of this uſe we gather a ſecond: viz. That a man ſhould ſett himſelfe to gaine Chriſt, rather and aboue all things, <hi>esteeming all other things but loſſe, and judging all to be but dung for the excellent knowledg ſake of Ieſus Christ our Lord,</hi> according as Paul did Philip. 3. 8. So (as with the ſame Apoſtle) he may ſencibly <hi>know the vertue of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and the fellowſhip of his afflictions. and be made conform to him in his death</hi> ibid. ver. 10 For as Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, <hi>What availeth it a man to win the whole world if he looſe? his ſoule. Mark. 8, 36.</hi> But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16996:47"/>
it is, that everie ſoule ſhall periſh eternally hereafter which gayneth not Chriſt in this preſent life. This yealds matter of juſt reproofe againſt the moſt part of men (if not all) who labour ſo much for the things of this earth, which are but tranſitorie vanities and helpe nothing to their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make ſo ſmall account of gayning Chriſt, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16996:48"/>
were the worſt ſort of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſers of Chriſt, (though theſe be ſo bad that they ſhall never taſt of the ſupper of the great King) but there is another ſort much more to be lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>red who are lovers of ſinfull pleaſures more then of God, ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time, appointed and ſette for the purchaſe and gayning of Chriſt, in abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable filthines, in cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, and wontonneſſe in gluttony, and drunckenneſſe, in ſport and unlawfull gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and ſinfull recreation of the fleſh, and had rather looſe the opportunity of gayning Chriſt in a ſermon, then fayle to accompliſh the leaſt deſire of their ſinfull hearts in fulfilling the luſts of the fleſh, whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt needs bee heavy
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16996:48"/>
and greivous before God, ſeing willingly they chooſe death with the contempt of life.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the points of tryall, now followes the fourth point which is the argument it ſelf, whereby the Apoſtle enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them to acknowledge that Chriſt in his miniſtry was not weake towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but mighty in them, which may be fully ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered after this manner in 2 ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral arguments, the firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is containd in the preceding words in this forme: If ye by try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all find yourſelves to be in the faith, and Chriſt in you, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt ye acknowledg that Chriſt is not weake but mighty in my mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry towards you, but by tryall ye ſhall find that you are in the faith and Chriſt in you, therefore yee muſt acknowledge Chriſt to bee mighty in my miniſtry toward
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:16996:49"/>
you. The 2. Argument is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the 2 part of this, that is: that by tryall they ſhall find themſelves in the faith and Chriſt in them after this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, eyther ye muſt find your ſelvs in the faith &amp; Chriſt in you, or the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye muſt bee reprobate Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but wee confidently truſt yee ſhall find yee are not reprobate Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, therefore ye muſt find yourſelvs to bee in the faith and Chriſt in you. Al the 3 parts of this argument may be eaſily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the Apo. words, for the propoſition is plaine in the 5 verſe, the aſſumtion, or 2 part is ſet downe in termes equivalent in the 6 verſe, &amp; the concluſion is implyed in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles urged interrogation what &amp;c. in the 5 verſe: of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion we haue ſpoken already: touching the aſſumption or 2
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:16996:49"/>
part we are not to ſpeake, ſo it reſts that we only entreat of the propoſition or firſt part, which ſeemes at the firſt to be a difficile and hard ſaying, but yet is moſt certaine &amp; true, for if that ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Apo. be marked, which is ſet downe in the 13 of the Acts, to wit, that <hi>all they who were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned to eternall life beleeved,</hi> we ſhall finde that the Apo. rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons according to the truth of the Goſpell, &amp; that it followes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, that whoſoeuer by the true miniſtry of the Goſpell are not made to believ, &amp; to embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce Chriſt, muſt bee of the no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of thoſe whom God never or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deynd to eternall life, &amp; this is cleare by 2 places of ſcripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many other, the 1. is in the Epiſtle to Tytus. Cap. 1. verſe 1. where the Apoſtle calls faith, <hi>the faith of Gods elect,</hi> which is as
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:16996:50"/>
much as to tell us, not onely that the Goſpell begets faith in none but ſuch only as are elected, but alſo that it doth beget faith in every one that is elected. The 2 is, in the Goſpell of Ioh. 10, 26, 27, viz. <hi>But ye beleeue not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheepe as I ſaid unto you, for my ſheepe heare my voyce &amp; I know them, and they follow mee,</hi> &amp; this is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the words of Chriſt in the 6 of Iohn verſe 35, 36, 37. <hi>he that beleeveth in mee ſhall never thirſt, but I ſayd unto you, that ye alſo haue ſeene mee and beleeue not, all that the father gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me ſhall come unto me,</hi> where he playnely affirmeth the cauſe why they did not beleeue, to be becauſe the father had not given the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unto him, or which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, becauſe they were not of his ſheepe, both which phraſes import aſmuch as that they wer
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:16996:50"/>
none of Gods elect: ſo that wee may conclude in the very words of the Apo. anſwering this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>hath God caſt away his people what then ſaith the Apoſtle, Iſraell hath not abtayned that he ſought but the election hath obtayned it &amp; the reſt haue bene hardned.</hi> Out of all which wee are plainely taught by God, that in whom the Goſpell truely preached worketh no faith, &amp; in whom by faith it planteth not Chriſt, they muſt be reprobats, hereby we learn that tho Goſpell preached is the fan of Chriſt by which in this life he maketh a diviſion of the chaffe from the corn, &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth thoſe whom the father hath given him from the wicked and ſuch as are forſaken of God, what then have they to boaſt of who vilipending the Goſpell &amp; miniſtry thereof as fooliſhnes do
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16996:51"/>
therby teſtify againſt themſelves that they are reprobats, but wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is juſtified of her owne children for whomſoever the Goſpell begetteth, they do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it to be both the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom &amp; power of God unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, &amp; to them the feete of thoſe that publiſh it are beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. To conclude this point, we may juſtly diſpiſe thoſe diſpyſers, &amp; al their contempt of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, ſeing it doth no hurt to us, nor our bleſſed miniſtry, but doth diſcover them to us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelvs that they are rejected of God, for if the Apo. conclude aright in the firſt Epiſt &amp; 1 Chap. to the Theſ. <hi>that he knew that they were elected of God, becauſe his Goſpell was unto them not in word onely, but alſo in power,</hi> doth not alſo this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſtand on the contrary, that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16996:51"/>
they are not elect of God to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Goſpell is onely in word, &amp; not in power, the words of Peter do demonſtrate the truth of this matter plainly, when he ſetteth downe this different judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of men touching Chriſt Ieſus our faviour, ſaying, <hi>unto you therefore which beleeve it is precious: but</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 7. 8.</note> 
               <hi>unto them which be diſobedient the ſtone which the builders diſallowed the ſame is made the head of corner &amp; a ſtone to ſtumble at &amp; Rocke of offence, even to them which ſtumble at the word, being diſobedient: unto the which thing they were even or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned.</hi> We need no clearer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therefore to make knowne unto us who are elect, &amp; who are reprobate &amp; forſaken of God, but this; even the judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every man concerning the Goſpell; &amp; miniſtry thereof.
